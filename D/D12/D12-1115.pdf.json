We propose a candidate ranking model for this-issue anaphora resolution that explores different issue-specific and general abstract-anaphora features. The model is not restricted to nominal or verbal antecedents; rather, it is able to identify antecedents that are arbitrary spans of text. Our results show that (a) the model outperforms the strong adjacent-sentence baseline; (b) general abstract-anaphora features, as distinguished from issue-specific features, play a crucial role in this-issue anaphora resolution, suggesting that our approach can be generalized for other NPs such as this problem and this debate; and (c) it is possible to reduce the search space in order to improve performance."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Anaphora in which the anaphoric expression refers to an abstract object such as a proposition, a property, or a fact is known as abstract object anaphora. This is seen in the following examples.","(1) [Be careful what you wish... because wishes sometimes come true.]i [That]i is what the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents U.S. manufacturers, has been learning. (from Asher (1993))","(2) This prospective study suggested [that oral carvedilol is more effective than oral metoprolol in the prevention of AF after on-pump CABG]i. It is well tolerated when started before and continued after the surgery. However, further prospective studies are needed to clarify [this issue]i.","(3) In principle, he said, airlines should be allowed [to sell standing-room-only tickets for adults]i — as long as [this decision]i was approved by their marketing departments. These examples highlight a difficulty not found with nominal anaphora. First, the anaphors refer to abstract concepts that can be expressed with different syntactic shapes which are usually not nominals. The anaphor That in (1) refers to the proposition in the previous utterance, whereas the anaphor this issue in (2) refers to a clause from the previous text. In (3), the anaphoric expression this decision refers to a verb phrase from the same sentence. Second, the antecedents do not always have precisely defined boundaries. In (2), for example, the whole sentence containing the marked clause could also be thought to be the correct antecedent. Third, the actual referents are not always the precise textual antecedents. The actual referent in (2), the issue to be clarified, is whether oral carvedilol is more effective than oral metoprolol in the prevention of AF after on-pump CABG or not, a variant of the antecedent text.","Generally, abstract anaphora, as distinguished from nominal anaphora, is signalled in English by pronouns this, that, and it (Müller, 2008). But in abstract anaphora, English prefers demonstratives to personal pronouns and definite articles (Passonneau, 1989; Navarretta, 2011).1","Demonstra-","1","This is not to say that personal pronouns and definite articles do not occur in abstract anaphora, but they are not common. 1255 tives can be used in isolation (That in (1)) or with nouns (e.g., this issue in (2)). The latter follows the pattern demonstrative {modifier}* noun. The demonstrative acts as a determiner and the noun following the demonstrative imposes selectional constraints for the antecedent, as in examples (2) and (3). Francis (1994) calls such nouns label nouns, which “serve to encapsulate or package a stretch of discourse”. Schmid (2000) refers to them as shell nouns, a metaphoric term which reflects different functions of these nouns such as encapsulation, pointing, and signalling.","Demonstrative nouns, along with pronouns like both and either, are referred to as sortal anaphors (Castaño et al., 2002; Lin and Liang, 2004; Torii and Vijay-Shanker, 2007). Castaño et al. observed that sortal anaphors are prevalent in the biomedical literature. They noted that among 100 distinct anaphors derived from a corpus of 70 Medline abstracts, 60% were sortal anaphors. But how often do demonstrative nouns refer to abstract objects? We observed that from a corpus of 74,000 randomly chosen Medline2","abstracts, of the first 150 most frequently occurring distinct demonstrative nouns (frequency > 30), 51.3% were abstract, 41.3% were concrete, and 7.3% were discourse deictic. This shows that abstract anaphora resolution is an important component of general anaphora resolution in the biomedical domain. However, automatic resolution of this type of anaphora has not attracted much attention and the previous work for this task is limited.","The present work is a step towards resolving abstract anaphora in written text. In particular, we choose the interesting abstract concept issue and demonstrate the complexities of resolving this-issue anaphora manually as well as automatically in the Medline domain. We present our algorithm, results, and error analysis for this-issue anaphora resolution.","The abstract concept issue was chosen for the following reasons. First, it occurs frequently in all kinds of text from newspaper articles to novels to scientific articles. There are 13,489 issue anaphora instances in the New York Times corpus and 1,116 instances in 65,000 Medline abstracts. Second, it is abstract enough that it can take several syntactic and 2 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.","html semantic forms, which makes the problem interesting and non-trivial. Third, issue referents in scientific literature generally lie in the previous sentence or two, which makes the problem tractable. Fourth, issues in Medline abstracts are generally associated with clinical problems in the medical domain and spell out the motivation of the research presented in the article. So extraction of this information would be useful in any biomedical information retrieval system."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Anaphora resolution has been extensively studied in computational linguistics (Hirst, 1981; Mitkov, 2002; Poesio et al., 2011). But CL research has mostly focused on nominal anaphora resolution (e.g., resolving multiple ambiguous mentions of a single entity representing a person, a location, or an organization) mainly for two reasons. First, nominal anaphora is the most frequently occurring anaphora in most domains, and second, there is a substantial amount of annotated data available for this kind of anaphora.","Besides pronominal anaphora, some work has been done on complement anaphora (Modjeska, 2003) (e.g., British and other European steelmakers). There is also some research on resolving sortal anaphora in the medical domain using domain knowledge (Castaño et al., 2002; Lin and Liang, 2004; Torii and Vijay-Shanker, 2007). But all these approaches focus only on the anaphors with nominal antecedents.","By contrast, the area of abstract object anaphora remains relatively unexplored mainly because the standard anaphora resolution features such as agreement and apposition cannot be applied to abstract anaphora resolution. Asher (1993) built a theoretical framework to resolve abstract anaphora. He divided discourse abstract anaphora into three broad categories: event anaphora, proposition anaphora, and fact anaphora, and discussed how abstract entities can be resolved using discourse representation theory. Chen et al. (2011) focused on a sub-set of event anaphora and resolved event coreference chains in terms of the representative verbs of the events from the OntoNotes corpus. Our task differs from their work as follows. Chen et al. mainly 1256 focus on events and actions and use verbs as a proxy for the non-nominal antecedents. But this-issue antecedents cannot usually be represented by a verb. Our work is not restricted to a particular syntactic type of the antecedent; rather we provide the flexibility of marking arbitrary spans of text as antecedents.","There are also some prominent approaches to abstract anaphora resolution in the spoken dialogue domain (Eckert and Strube, 2000; Byron, 2004; Müller, 2008). These approaches go beyond nominal antecedents; however, they are restricted to spoken dialogues in specific domains and need serious adaptation if one wants to apply them to arbitrary text.","In addition to research on resolution, there is also some work on effective annotation of abstract anaphora (Strube and Müller, 2003; Botley, 2006; Poesio and Artstein, 2008; Dipper and Zinsmeister, 2011). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no English corpus annotated for issue anaphora antecedents."]},{"title":"3 Data and Annotation","paragraphs":["To create an initial annotated dataset, we collected 188 this {modifier}* issue instances along with the surrounding context from Medline abstracts.3","Five instances were discarded as they had an unrelated (publication related) sense. Among the remaining 183 instances, 132 instances were independently annotated by two annotators, a domain expert and a non-expert, and the remaining 51 instances were annotated only by the domain expert. We use the former instances for training and the latter instances (unseen by the developer) for testing. The annotator’s task was to mark arbitrary text segments as antecedents (without concern for their linguistic types). To make the task tractable, we assumed that an antecedent does not span multiple sentences but lies in a single sentence (since we are dealing with singular this-issue anaphors) and that it is a continuous span of text.","3","Although our dataset is rather small, its size is similar to other available abstract anaphora corpora in English: 154 instances in Eckert and Strube (2000), 69 instances in Byron (2003), 462 instances annotated by only one annotator in Botley (2006), and 455 instances restricted to those which have only nominal or clausal antecedents in Poesio and Artstein (2008). r11 r12 r13 r14 r15 r21 r22 r23 r24 r25 Annotator 1 Annotator 2 r16 r17 r18 r19 r26 r27 r28 r29 r2,10 id 2 Intersections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 id 3 id 4 id 5 id 1 id 2 id 3 id 4 id 5 Figure 1: Example of annotated data.

We use Krippendorff’s reliability coefficient for unitizing (αu) (Krippendorff, 1995) which has not often been used or described in CL. In our context, unitizing means marking the spans of the text that serve as the antecedent for the given anaphors within the given text. The coefficient αu assumes that the annotated sections do not overlap in a single annotator’s output and our data satisfies this criterion.4","The general form of coefficientαu is:","αu = 1 − uDo uDe (1) where uDo and uDe are observed and expected disagreements respectively. Both disagreement quantities express the average squared differences between the mismatching pairs of values assigned by annotators to given units of analysis. αu = 1 indicates perfect reliability and αu = 0 indicates the absence of reliability. When αu < 0, the disagreement is systematic. Annotated data with reliability of αu ≥ 0.80 is considered reliable (Krippendorff, 2004).","Krippendorff’s αu is non-trivial, and explaining it in detail would take too much space, but the general idea, in our context, is as follows. The annotators mark the antecedents corresponding to each anaphor in their respective copies of the text, as shown in Figure 1. The marked antecedents are mutually exclusive sections r; we denote the jth","section identified","4","If antecedents overlap with each other in a single annotator’s output (which is a rare event) we construct data that satisfies the non-overlap criterion by creating different copies of the same text corresponding to each anaphor instance. 1257 Antecedent type Distribution Example clause 37.9% There is a controversial debate (SBAR whether back school program might improve quality of life in back pain patients).

In Figure 1, annotators 1 and 2 have reached different conclusions by identifying 9 and 10 sections respectively in their copies of the text. Annotator 1 has not marked any antecedent for the anaphor with id = 1, while annotator 2 has marked r21 for the same anaphor. Both annotators have marked exactly the same antecedent for the anaphor with id = 4. The difference between two annotated sections is defined in terms of the square of the distance between the non-overlapping parts of the sections. The distance is 0 when the sections are unmarked by both annotators or are marked and exactly same, and is the summation of the squares of the unmatched parts if they are different. The coefficient is computed using intersections of the marked sections. In Figure 1, annotators 1 and 2 have a total of 14 intersections. The observed disagreement uDo is the weighted sum of the differences between all mismatching intersections of sections marked by the annotators, and the expected disagreement is the summation of all possible differences of pairwise combinations of all sections of all annotators normalized by the length of the text (in terms of the number of tokens) and the number of pairwise combinations of annotators.","For our data, the inter-annotator agreement was αu = 0.86 (uDo = 0.81 and uDe = 5.81) despite the fact that the annotators differed in their domain expertise, which suggests that abstract concepts such as issue can be annotated reliably. 3.2 Corpus Statistics A gold standard corpus was created by resolving the cases where the annotators disagreed. Among 132 training instances, the annotators could not resolve 6 instances and we broke the tie by writing to the authors of the articles and using their response to resolve the disagreement. In the gold standard corpus, 95.5% of the antecedents were in the current or previous sentence and 99.2% were in the current or previous two sentences. Only one antecedent was found more than two sentences back and it was six sentences back. One instance was a cataphor, but the antecedent occurred in the same sentence as the anaphor. This suggests that for an automatic this-issue resolution system, it would be reasonable to consider only the previous two sentences along with the sentence containing the anaphor.","The distribution of the different linguistic forms that an antecedent of this-issue can take in our data set is shown in Table 1. The majority of antecedents are clauses or whole sentences. A number of antecedents are noun phrases, but these are generally nominalizations that refer to abstract concepts (e.g., the influence of estrogen alone on breast cancer detection). Some antecedents are not even well-defined syntactic constituents5","but are combinations of several well-defined constituents. We denote the type of such antecedents as mixed. In the corpus, 18.2% of the antecedents are of this type, suggesting that it is not sufficient to restrict the antecedent search space to well-defined syntactic constituents.6","In our data, we did not find anaphoric chains for any of the this-issue anaphor instances, which indicates that the antecedents of this-issue anaphors are 5 We refer to every syntactic constituent identified by the","parser as a well-defined syntactic constituent. 6 Indeed, many of mixed type antecedents (nearly three-","quarters of them) are the result of parser attachment errors, but","many are not. 1258 in the reader’s local memory and not in the global memory. This observation supports the THIS-NPs hypothesis (Gundel et al., 1993; Poesio and Modjeska, 2002) that this-NPs are used to refer to entities which are active albeit not in focus, i.e., they are not the center of the previous utterance."]},{"title":"4 Resolution Algorithm4.1 Candidate Extraction","paragraphs":["For correct resolution, the set of extracted candidates must contain the correct antecedent in the first place. The problem of candidate extraction is non-trivial in abstract anaphora resolution because the antecedents are of many different types of syntactic constituents such as clauses, sentences, and nominalizations. Drawing on our observation that the mixed type antecedents are generally a combination of different well-defined syntactic constituents, we extract the set of candidate antecedents as follows. First, we create a set of candidate sentences which contains the sentence containing the this-issue anaphor and the two preceding sentences. Then, we parse every candidate sentence with the Stanford Parser7",". Initially, the set of candidate constituents contains a list of well-defined syntactic constituents. We require that the node type of these constituents be in the set {S, SBAR, NP, SQ, SBARQ, S+V}. This set was empirically derived from our data. To each constituent, there is associated a set of mixed type constituents. These are created by concatenating the original constituent with its sister constituents. For example, in (4), the set of well-defined eligible candidate constituents is {NP, NP1} and so NP1 PP1 is a mixed type candidate. (4) NP NP1 PP1 PP2 The set of candidate constituents is updated with the extracted mixed type constituents. Extracting mixed type candidate constituents not only deals with mixed type instances as shown in Table 1, but as a side effect it also corrects some attachment errors made by the parser. Finally, the constituents 7 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/","lex-parser.shtml having a number of leaves (words) less than a threshold8","are discarded to give the final set of candidate constituents. 4.2 Features We explored the effect of including 43 automatically extracted features (12 feature classes), which are summarized in Table 2. The features can also be broadly divided into two groups: issue-specific features and general abstract-anaphora features. Issue-specific features are based on our common-sense knowledge of the concept of issue and the different semantic forms it can take; e.g., controversy (X is controversial), hypothesis (It has been hypothesized X), or lack of knowledge (X is unknown), where X is the issue. In our data, we observed certain syntactic patterns of issues such as whether X or not and that X and the IP feature class encodes this information. Other issue-specific features are IVERB and IHEAD. The feature IVERB checks whether the governing verb of the candidate is an issue verb (e.g., speculate, hypothesize, argue, debate), whereas IHEAD checks whether the candidate head in the dependency tree is an issue word (e.g., controversy, uncertain, unknown). The general abstract-anaphora resolution features do not make use of the semantic properties of the word issue. Some of these features are derived empirically from the training data (e.g., ST, L, D). The EL feature is borrowed from Müller (2008) and encodes the embedding level of the candidate within the candidate sentence. The MC feature tries to capture the idea of the THIS-NPs hypothesis (Gundel et al., 1993; Poesio and Modjeska, 2002) that the antecedents of this-NP anaphors are not the center of the previous utterance. The general abstract-anaphora features in the SR feature class capture the semantic role of the candidate in the candidate sentence. We used the Illinois Semantic Role Labeler9","for SR features. The general abstract-anaphora features also contain a few lexical features (e.g., M, SC). But these features are independent of the semantic properties of the word issue. The general abstract-anaphora resolution features also contain dependency-tree features, lexical-8 The threshold 5 was empirically derived.

All features are extracted automatically. 1260 overlap features, and context features. 4.3 Candidate Ranking Model Given an anaphor ai and a set of candidate antecedents C = {C1,C2, ...,Ck}, the problem of anaphora resolution is to choose the best candidate antecedent for ai. We follow the candidate-ranking model proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2008). The advantage of the candidate-ranking model over the mention-pair model is that it overcomes the strong independence assumption made in mention-pair models and evaluates how good a candidate is relative to all other candidates.","We train our model as follows. If the anaphor is a this-issue anaphor, the set C is extracted using the candidate extraction algorithm from Section 4.1. Then a corresponding set of feature vectors, Cf = {Cf 1,Cf 2, ...,Cf k}, is created using the features in Table 2. The training instances are created as described by Soon et al. (2001). Note that the instance creation is simpler than for general coreference resolution because of the absence of anaphoric chains in our data. For every anaphor ai and eligible candidates Cf = {Cf 1,Cf 2, ...,Cf k}, we create training examples (ai,Cf i, label), ∀Cf i ∈ Cf . The label is 1 if Ci is the true antecedent of the anaphor ai, otherwise the label is −1. The examples with label 1 get the rank of 1, while other examples get the rank of 2. We use SVMrank","(Joachims, 2002) for training the candidate-ranking model. During testing, the trained model is used to rank the candidates of each test instance of this-issue anaphor."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section we present the evaluation of each component of our resolution system. 5.1 Evaluation of Candidate Extraction The set of candidate antecedents extracted by the method from Section 4.1 contained the correct antecedent 92% of the time. Each anaphor had, on average, 23.80 candidates, of which only 5.19 candidates were nominal type. The accuracy dropped to 84% when we did not extract mixed type candidates. The error analysis of the 8% of the instances where we failed to extract the correct antecedent revealed that most of these errors were parsing errors which could not be corrected by our candidate extraction method.10","In these cases, the parts of the antecedent had been placed in completely different branches of the parse tree. For example, in (5), the correct antecedent is a combination of the NP from the S → V P → NP → PP → NP branch and the PP from S → V P → PP branch. In such a case, concatenating sister constituents does not help.","(5) The data from this pilot study (VP (VBP provide) (NP (NP no evidence) (PP (IN for) (NP a difference in hemodynamic effects between pulse HVHF and CPFA))) (PP in patients with septic shock already receiving CRRT)). A larger sample size is needed to adequately explore this issue. 5.2 Evaluation of this-issue Resolution We propose two metrics for abstract anaphora evaluation. The simplest metric is the percentage of antecedents on which the system and the annotated gold data agree. We denote this metric as EXACT-M (Exact Match) and compute it as the ratio of number of correctly identified antecedents to the total number of marked antecedents. This metric is a good indicator of a system’s performance; how-ever, it is a rather strict evaluation because, as we noted in section 1, issues generally have no precise boundaries in the text. So we propose another metric called RLL, which is similar to the ROUGE-L metric (Lin, 2004) used for the evaluation of automatic summarization. Let the marked antecedents of the gold corpus for k anaphor instances be G = ⟨g1, g2, ..., gk⟩ and the system-annotated antecedents be A = ⟨a1, a2, ..., ak⟩. Let the number of words in G and A be m and n respectively. Let LCS(gi, ai) be the the number of words in the longest common subsequence of gi and ai. Then the precision (PRLL) and recall (RRLL) over the whole data set are computed as shown in equations (2) and (3). PRLL is the total number of word overlaps between the gold and system-annotated antecedents normalized by the number of words in system-annotated antecedents and RRLL is the total number of such word overlaps normalized by the number of words in the gold antecedents. If the system picks too much text for antecedents, RRLL is high but PRLL is low.

The empirically derived feature sets IP (issue patterns) and D (distance) appeared in almost all best feature set combinations. Removing D resulted in a 6 percentage points drop in FRLL and a 4 percentage points drop in EXACT-M scores. Surprisingly, feature set ST (syntactic type) was not included in most of the best performing set of feature sets. The combination of syntactic and semantic feature sets {IP, D, EL, MC, L, SR, DT} gave the best FRLL and EXACT-M scores for the cross-validation experiments. For the test-data experiments, the combination of semantic and lexical features {D, C, LO, L, SC, SR, DT} gave the best FRLL results, whereas syntactic, discourse, and semantic features {IP, D, C, EL, L, SC, SR, DT} gave the best EXACT-M results. Overall, row 3 of the table gives reasonable results for both cross-validation and test-data experiments with no statistically significant difference to the corresponding best 1262 EXACT-M scores in rows 6 and 5 respectively.12","To pinpoint the errors made by our system, we carried out three experiments. In the first experiment, we examined the contribution of issue-specific features versus non-issue features (rows 9 and 10). Interestingly, when we used only non-issue features, the performance dropped only slightly. The FRLL results from using only issue-specific features were below baseline, suggesting that the more general features associated with abstract anaphora play a crucial role in resolving this-issue anaphora.","In the second experiment, we determined the error caused by the candidate extractor component of our system. Row 12 of the table gives the result when an oracle candidate extractor was used to add the correct antecedent in the set of candidates when-ever our candidate extractor failed. This did not affect cross-validation results by much because of the rarity of such instances. However, in the test-data experiment, the EXACT-M improvements that resulted were statistically significant. This shows that our resolution algorithm was able to identify antecedents that were arbitrary spans of text.","In the last experiment, we examined the effect of the reduction of the candidate search space. We assumed an oracle candidate sentence extractor (Row 13) which knows the exact candidate sentence in which the antecedent lies. We can see that both RLL and EXACT-M scores markedly improved in this setting. In response to these results, we trained a decision-tree classifier to identify the correct antecedent sentence with simple location and length features and achieved 95% accuracy in identifying the correct candidate sentence."]},{"title":"6 Discussion and Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have demonstrated the possibility of resolving complex abstract anaphora, namely, this-issue anaphora having arbitrary antecedents. The work takes the annotation work of Botley (2006) and Dipper and Zinsmeister (2011) to the next level by resolving this-issue anaphora automatically. We proposed a set of 43 automatically extracted features that can be used for resolving abstract anaphora.","12","We performed a simple one-tailed, k-fold cross-validated paired t-test at significance levelp = 0.05 to determine whether the difference between the EXACT-M scores of two feature classes is statistically significant.","Our results show that general abstract-anaphora resolution features (i.e., other than issue-specific features) play a crucial role in resolving this-issue anaphora. This is encouraging, as it suggests that the approach could be generalized for other NPs — especially NPs having similar semantic constraints such as this problem, this decision, and this conflict.","The results also show that reduction of search space markedly improves the resolution performance, suggesting that a two-stage process that first identifies the broad region of the antecedent and then pinpoints the exact antecedent might work better than the current single-stage approach. The rationale behind this two-stage process is twofold. First, the search space of abstract anaphora is large and noisy compared to nominal anaphora.13","And second, it is possible to reduce the search space and accurately identify the broad region of the antecedents using simple features such as the location of the anaphor in the anaphor sentence (e.g., if the anaphor occurs at the beginning of the sentence, the antecedent is most likely present in the previous sentence).","We chose scientific articles over general text because in the former domain the actual referents are seldom discourse deictic (i.e., not present in the text). In the news domain, for instance, which we have also examined and are presently annotating, a large percentage of this-issue antecedents lie out-side the text. For example, newspaper articles often quote sentences of others who talk about the issues in their own world, as shown in example (6).","(6) As surprising and encouraging to organizers of the movement are the Wall Street names added to their roster. Prominent among them is Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager who is straight and chairman of the conservative Manhattan Institute. He has donated more than $8 million to various same-sex marriage efforts, in states including California, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Oregon, much of it since 2007. “It’s become something that gradually peo-","13","If we consider all well-defined syntactic constituents of a sentence as issue candidates, in our data, a sentence has on average 43.61 candidates. Combinations of several well-defined syntactic constituents only add to this number. Hence if we consider the antecedent candidates from the previous 2 or 3 sentences, the search space can become quite large and noisy. 1263 ple like myself weren’t afraid to fund, weren’t afraid to speak out on,” Mr. Singer said in an in-terview. “I’m somebody who is philosophically very conservative, and on this issue I thought that this really was important on the basis of liberty and actual family stability.” In such a case, the antecedent of this issue is not always in the text of the newspaper article itself, but must be inferred from the context of the quotation and the world of the speaker quoted. That said, we do not use any domain-specific information in our this-issue resolution model. Our features are solely based on distance, syntactic structure, and semantic and lexical properties of the candidate antecedents which could be extracted for text in any domain.","Issue anaphora can also be signalled by demonstratives other than this. However, for our initial study, we chose this issue for two reasons. First, in our corpus as well as in other general corpora such as the New York Times corpus, issue occurs much more frequently with this than other demonstratives. Second, we did not want to increase the complexity of the problem by including the plural issues.","Our approach needs further development to make it useful. Our broad goal is to resolve abstract anaphora signalled by label nouns in all kinds of text. At present, the major obstacle is that there is very little annotated data available that could be used to train an abstract anaphora resolution system. And the understanding of abstract anaphora itself is still at an early stage; it would be premature to think about unsupervised approaches. In this work, we studied the narrow problem of resolution of this-issue anaphora in the medical domain to get a good grasp of the general abstract-anaphora resolution problem.","A number of extensions are planned for this work. First, we will extend the work to resolve other abstract anaphors (e.g., this decision, this problem). Second, we will experiment with a two-stage resolution approach. Third, we would like to explore the effect of including serious discourse structure features in our model. (The feature sets SC and C encode only shallow discourse information.) Finally, during annotation, we noted a number of issue patterns (e.g., An open question is X, X is under debate); a possible extension is extracting issues and problems from text using these patterns as seed patterns."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Dr. Brian Budgell from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College for annotating our data and for helpful discussions.
