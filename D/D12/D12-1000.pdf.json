After the successful first collaboration in 2007, EMNLP-CoNLL 2012 is being jointly organized by the SIGDAT and SIGNLL special interest groups of the Association of Computational Linguistics. This time, EMNLP-CoNLL is co-located with, and immediately after ACL’s 50th anniversary conference. The choice of the location is an opportunity for the ACL community to return to the beautiful Jeju Island, Korea, following a seven-year hiatus since the Second International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP 2005) was held here. Out of 606 submissions received by EMNLP-CoNLL this year, a total of 36 submissions were eventually withdrawn or rejected without review. From the remaining submissions, 99 were accepted for oral presentation and 40 for poster presentation, for a combined acceptance rate of 24.8%. As in recent editions of EMNLP, authors were given the opportunity to provide supplementary material in conjunction with their submissions, which the program committee could but was not required to take into account during reviewing. Also as in recent editions, authors of accepted papers were offered an additional page in the camera-ready version of their submissions, so that comments received from reviewers could be more easily addressed. The papers submitted to the conference were subject to a rigorous reviewing process, made possible by efforts of a team of 525 primary and 66 secondary reviewers, acting under the guidance of 22 area chairs. Presence of unsupported claims, or failure to properly compare with previous work, were likely serious obstacles, on the path from initial submission to acceptance and then publication in our proceedings. Luckily, our preface has a guaranteed placement in the proceedings. Therefore, without access to insider data and impressions from previous editions of the conference, we will still go on a limb here, and make the unsupported claim that our team of area chairs has been the greatest. That their expertise, dedication and willingness to go beyond the call of duty had a positive impact on a timely reviewing process and a high-quality conference program, would be an understatement. It has been a pleasure to interact and work with our area chairs. The schedule of our conference is strengthened by two invited speakers, Eric Xing and Patrick Pantel, who we were very happy to have accept our invitation; and by the CoNLL Shared Task, an annual tradition for the CoNLL conferences. This year’s CoNLL Shared Task is Modeling Multilingual Unrestricted Coreference in OntoNotes, and its proceedings and detailed schedule are available separately. We would like to thank all authors who submitted to our conference, for their willingness to share their knowledge with the rest of us. It may take a few weeks or many years, for the knowledge distilled into the present proceedings to have a measurable impact on our field and beyond. An impact that would not be possible without countless hours spent by authors, from developing ideas to running experiments to building usable systems - steps that often fail, and sometimes succeed. We would also like to thank all members of the program committee, for their willingness to offer iii feedback that sometimes reaches extraordinary levels of detail and value to authors. To recognise some of the most dedicated reviewers, we include the Best Reviewer awards a little later in these proceedings. Naoaki Okazaki, Publications Chair, deserves our special thanks. He brought in a healthy dose of rigor to the planning and preparation of not only this proceedings but also conference materials, matched only by his dedication to deliver under tight scheduling constraints. If the combination of oral presentations, posters and invited talks that make up EMNLP-CoNLL 2012 is considered a success, it is because it benefited from the touch of many people. Francesco Figari easily kept tabs on our salvos of large and small requests for updates to our conference website. Rich Gerber, Paolo Gai and the larger team managing the conference submission system were quick to offer answers to all our questions. The publication chairs and local arrangements committee of ACL 2012, including Michael White, Maggie Li, Jong Park and especially Gary Geunbae Lee, covered significant tasks on behalf of EMNLP-CoNLL, all with a smile. Chin-Yew Lin, Miles Osborne, Eric Fosler-Lussier, Dekang Lin, Rada Mihalcea, Regina Barzilay, Ulrich Germann and David Yarowsky offered high-level advice or answered detailed questions, drawing upon their experience as organizers of previous ACL-sponsored conferences. We are grateful to our sponsors (Baidu, Google and Microsoft), for their support of best paper awards and support of student travel in particular, and the financial well-being of the conference in general. It has been an honor to be of service to the conference, for which we would like to thank the community and those who offered us this opportunity. We hope that you enjoy the conference, and have a productive and pleasant stay in South Korea!

A SIOM can nicely capture rich structural properties in the data and in the problem, but it also raises severe computational and theoretical challenge on sparse, consistent, and tractable model identification and inference. In this talk, I will present models, algorithms, and theories that learn Sparse SIOMs of various kinds in very high dimensional input/output space, with fast and highly scalable optimization procedures, and strong statistical guarantees. I will demonstrate application of our approach to problems in large-scale text classification, topic modeling, and dependency parsing. “The Appification of the Web and the Renaissance of Conversational User Interfaces” Patrick Pantel, Microsoft Research The appification of the Web is triggering a fundamental shift in how users access information. We are moving from centralized access points, such as search engines, towards highly specialized, and yet fragmented, functionalities in disconnected apps. This talk explores an entity-centric conversational interface as a mechanism to overcome this fragmentation, highlighting the numerous associated NLP challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Consider mobile scenarios, where the traditional search engine paradigm is being cannibalized by search and browse functionalities built directly into specialized apps. For example, while users can search for restaurants and products using their mobile browser, they are increasingly turning directly to applications such as Yelp, Urbanspoon and Amazon. However, interoperability between applications and lacking generalized interfaces to their functionalities pose serious scalability challenges. In this talk, we argue for an entity-centric conversational interface in which natural user interactions with entities are paired with actions that can be performed on the entities, thus enabling the brokering of web pages and applications that can satisfy the intended action. In this vision, the broker is aware of all entities and actions of interest to its users, understands the intent of the user, and provides direct actionable results through APIs with external providers satisfying the intent. The user saves clicks and time to accomplish her intended action and can discover related actions. New revenue streams open up from paid action placement and lead generation opportunities. At the forefront of this direction are a number of NLP challenges in the areas of entity recognition, entity linking, knowledge extraction, intent recognition, and dialog modeling, to name a few. We end by proposing one particular technique for learning and mapping user intents in a search interface. In an annotation study conducted over a traffic sample of web usage logs, we found that a large proportion of user queries involve actions on entities, calling for an automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries. We pose the problem of finding actions ix that can be performed on entities as the problem of doing probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how entity-bearing information requests are generated. Given a large collection of real-world queries and clicks from a commercial search engine, the models are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an EM algorithm. Given a new query, inference enables the recommendation of a set of pertinent actions and providers. We propose an evaluation methodology for measuring the relevance of our recommended actions, and show empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions. x Best Reviewer Awards: Hua Ai Ion Androutsopoulos Yoav Artzi Mohit Bansal Aditya Bhargava Graeme Blackwood Sasha Blair-Goldensohn David Burkett Marie Candito Marine Carpuat Xavier Carreras Soumen Chakrabarti Colin Cherry Mark Dredze Kevin Duh David Elson Katja Filippova Matthew Gerber Kevin Gimpel Yoav Goldberg Spence Green Greg Hanneman Saša Hasan Alexander Kotov Jayant Krishnamurthy Marco Kuhlmann Roland Kuhn Mirella Lapata Annie Louis Andre Martins Ryan McDonald Robert Moore Arjun Mukherjee Vanessa Murdock Jason Naradowsky Roberto Navigli Vincent Ng John Niekrasz Joakim Nivre Becky Passonneau Hoifung Poon Andrei Popescu-Belis Owen Rambow Ines Rehbein Alan Ritter Alexander Rush Noah Smith Oren Tsur Oscar Täckström Lucy Vanderwende Jette Viethen Gerhard Weikum Janyce Wiebe Joern Wuebker Yue Zhang xi"]},{"title":"Table of Contents","paragraphs":["Syntactic Transfer Using a Bilingual Lexicon Greg Durrett, Adam Pauls and Dan Klein . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1","Regularized Interlingual Projections: Evaluation on Multilingual Transliteration Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi and Hal Daume III . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12","Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora Using Label Propagation Akihiro Tamura, Taro Watanabe and Eiichiro Sumita . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24","Lexical Differences in Autobiographical Narratives from Schizophrenic Patients and Healthy Controls Kai Hong, Christian G.
