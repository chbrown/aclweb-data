Using word fertility features has been shown to be useful in building word alignment models for statistical machine translation. We built a fertility hidden Markov model by adding fertility to the hidden Markov model. This model not only achieves lower alignment error rate than the hidden Markov model, but also runs faster. It is similar in some ways to IBM Model 4, but is much easier to understand. We use Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation, which is more principled than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["IBM models and the hidden Markov model (HMM) for word alignment are the most influential statistical word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003). There are three kinds of important information for word alignment models: lexicality, locality and fertility. IBM Model 1 uses only lexical information; IBM Model 2 and the hidden Markov model take advantage of both lexical and locality information; IBM Models 4 and 5 use all three kinds of information, and they remain the state of the art despite the fact that they were developed almost two decades ago.","Recent experiments on large datasets have shown that the performance of the hidden Markov model is very close to IBM Model 4. Nevertheless, we be-lieve that IBM Model 4 is essentially a better model because it exploits the fertility of words in the target language. However, IBM Model 4 is so complex that most researches use the GIZA++ software package (Och and Ney, 2003), and IBM Model 4 it-self is treated as a black box. The complexity in IBM Model 4 makes it hard to understand and to improve. Our goal is to build a model that includes lexicality, locality, and fertility; and, at the same time, to make it easy to understand. We also want it to be accurate and computationally efficient.","There have been many years of research on word alignment. Our work is different from others in essential ways. Most other researchers take either the HMM alignments (Liang et al., 2006) or IBM Model 4 alignments (Cherry and Lin, 2003) as in-put and perform post-processing, whereas our model is a potential replacement for the HMM and IBM Model 4. Directly modeling fertility makes our model fundamentally different from others. Most models have limited ability to model fertility. Liang et al. (2006) learn the alignment in both translation directions jointly, essentially pushing the fertility to-wards 1. ITG models (Wu, 1997) assume the fertility to be either zero or one. It can model phrases, but the phrase has to be contiguous. There have been works that try to simulate fertility using the hidden Markov model (Toutanova et al., 2002; Deng and Byrne, 2005), but we prefer to model fertility directly.","Our model is a coherent generative model that combines the HMM and IBM Model 4. It is easier to understand than IBM Model 4 (see Section 3). Our model also removes several undesired properties in IBM Model 4. We use Gibbs sampling instead of a heuristic-based neighborhood method for parameter 596 estimation. Our distortion parameters are similar to IBM Model 2 and the HMM, while IBM Model 4 uses inverse distortion (Brown et al., 1993). Our model assumes that fertility follows a Poisson distribution, while IBM Model 4 assumes a multinomial distribution, and has to learn a much larger number of parameters, which makes it slower and less reliable. Our model is much faster than IBM Model 4. In fact, we will show that it is also faster than the HMM, and has lower alignment error rate than the HMM.","Parameter estimation for word alignment models that model fertility is more difficult than for models without fertility. Brown et al. (1993) and Och and Ney (2003) first compute the Viterbi alignments for simpler models, then consider only some neighbors of the Viterbi alignments for modeling fertility. If the optimal alignment is not in those neighbors, this method will not be able find the optimal alignment. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for training and decoding, which has nice probabilistic guarantees. DeNero et al. (2008) applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to word alignment for machine translation; they do not model word fertility."]},{"title":"2 Statistical Word Alignment Models2.1 Alignment and Fertility","paragraphs":["Given a source sentence f J","1 = f1, f2, . . . , fJ and a target sentence eI","1 = e1, e2, . . . , eI , we define the alignments between the two sentences as a subset of the Cartesian product of the word positions. Following Brown et al. (1993), we assume that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word. We denote as aJ","1 = a1, a2, . . . , aJ the alignments between f J","1 and eI","1. When a word fj is not aligned with any word e, aj is 0. For convenience, we add an empty word ε to the target sentence at position 0 (i.e., e0 = ε). However, as we will see, we have to add more than one empty word for the HMM. In order to compute the “jump probability” in the HMM model, we need to know the position of the aligned target word for the previous source word. If the previous source word aligns to an empty word, we could use the position of the empty word to indicate the nearest previous source word that does not align to an empty word. For this reason, we use a total of I + 1 empty words for the HMM model1",". Moore (2004) also suggested adding multiple empty words to the target sentence for IBM Model 1. After we add I + 1 empty words to the target sentence, the alignment is a mapping from source to target word positions: a : j → i, i = aj where j = 1, 2, . . . , J and i = 1, 2, . . . , 2I + 1. Words from position I + 1 to 2I + 1 in the target sentence are all empty words.","We allow each source word to align with exactly one target word, but each target word may align with multiple source words.","The fertility φi of a word ei at position i is defined as the number of aligned source words: φi = J ∑ j=1 δ(aj, i) where δ is the Kronecker delta function:","δ(x, y) = { 1 if x = y 0 otherwise","In particular, the fertility of all empty words in the target sentence is ∑2I+1","i=I+1 φi. We define φε ≡ ∑2I+1","i=I+1 φi. For a bilingual sentence pair e2I+1","1 and f J 1 , we have ∑I","i=1 φi + φε = J .","The inverted alignments for position i in the target sentence are a set Bi, such that each element in Bi is aligned with i, and all alignments of i are in Bi. Inverted alignments are explicitly used in IBM Models 3, 4 and 5, but not in our model, which is one reason that our model is easier to understand. 2.2 IBM Model 1 and HMM IBM Model 1 and the HMM are both generative models, and both start by defining the probability of alignments and source sentence given the target sentence: P (aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 ); the data likelihood can be computed by summing over alignments:","1","If fj−1 does not align with an empty word and fj aligns with an empty word, we want to record the position of the target word that fj−1 aligns with. There are I + 1 possibilities: fj is the first word in the source sentence, or fj−1 aligns with one of the target word. 597","P (f J 1 |e2I+1 1 ) = ∑","aJ","1 P (aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 ).

The expectation","maximization algorithm is used to learn the parame-","ters such that the data likelihood is maximized.","Without loss of generality, P (aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 ) can","be decomposed into length probabilities, distor-","tion probabilities (also called alignment probabil-","ities), and lexical probabilities (also called transla-","tion probabilities):","P (aJ 1 , f J 1 |e2I+1","1 )","= P (J |e2I+1","1 ) J ∏ j=1 P (aj, fj|f j−1","1 , aj−1","1 , e2I+1","1 )","= P (J |e2I+1","1 ) J","∏","j=1 (","P (aj|f j−1","1 , aj−1","1 , e2I+1","1 ) ×","P (fj|f j−1","1 , aj","1, e2I+1","1 )) where","P (J |e2I+1 1 ) is a length probability,","P (aj|f j−1","1 , aj−1","1 , e2I+1","1 ) is a distortion probability and P (fj|f j−1","1 , aj","1, e2I+1","1 ) is a lexical probability.","IBM Model 1 assumes a uniform distortion probability, a length probability that depends only on the length of the target sentence, and a lexical probability that depends only on the aligned target word:","P (aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1 1 ) = P (J |I)","(2I + 1)J J","∏","j=1 P (fj|eaj )","The hidden Markov model assumes a length probability that depends only on the length of the target sentence, a distortion probability that depends only on the previous alignment and the length of the target sentence, and a lexical probability that depends only on the aligned target word:","P (aJ 1 , f J 1 |e2I+1","1 ) = P (J |I) J ∏ j=1 P (aj|aj−1, I)P (fj|eaj )","In order to make the HMM work correctly, we en-force the following constraints (Och and Ney, 2003):","P (i + I + 1|i′ , I) = p0δ(i, i′",")","P (i + I + 1|i′ + I + 1, I) = p0δ(i, i′",")","P (i|i′ + I + 1, I) = P (i|i′",", I) where the first two equations imply that the probability of jumping to an empty word is either 0 or p0, and the third equation implies that the probability of jumping from a non-empty word is the same as the probability of jumping from the corespondent empty word.","The absolute position in the HMM is not important, because we re-parametrize the distortion probability in terms of the distance between adjacent alignment points (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003):","P (i|i′ , I) =","c(i − i′",")","∑","i′′ c(i′′","− i′",") where c( ) is the count of jumps of a given distance.","In IBM Model 1, the word order does not matter. The HMM is more likely to align a source word to a target word that is adjacent to the previous aligned target word, which is more suitable than IBM Model 1 because adjacent words tend to form phrases.","For these two models, in theory, the fertility for a target word can be as large as the length of the source sentence. In practice, the fertility for a target word in IBM Model 1 is not very big except for rare target words, which can become a garbage collector, and align to many source words (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003; Moore, 2004). The HMM is less likely to have this garbage collector problem because of the alignment probability constraint. However, fertility is an inherent cross-language property and these two models cannot assign consistent fertility to words. This is our motivation for adding fertility to these two models, and we expect that the resulting models will perform better than the baseline models. Because the HMM performs much better than IBM Model 1, we expect that the fertility hidden Markov model will perform much better than the fertility IBM Model 1. Throughout the paper, “our model” refers to the fertility hidden Markov model.","Due to space constraints, we are unable to provide details for IBM Models 3, 4 and 5; see Brown et al. (1993) and Och and Ney (2003). But we want to point out that the locality property modeled in the HMM is missing in IBM Model 3, and is modeled invertedly in IBM Model 4. IBM Model 5 removes deficiency (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) 598 from IBM Model 4, but it is computationally very expensive due to the larger number of parameters than IBM Model 4, and IBM Model 5 often provides no improvement on alignment accuracy."]},{"title":"3 Fertility Hidden Markov Model","paragraphs":["Our fertility IBM Model 1 and fertility HMM","are both generative models and start by defin-","ing the probability of fertilities (for each","non-empty target word and all empty words),","alignments, and the source sentence given","the target sentence: P (φI","1, φε, aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 );","the data likelihood can be computed by","summing over fertilities and alignments:","P (f J 1 |e2I+1","1 ) = ∑","φI","1,φε,aJ","1 P (φI","1, φε, aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 ).

However, we also en-force the fertility for the same target word across the corpus to be consistent. The expected fertility for a non-empty word ei is λ(ei), and the expected fertility for all empty words is Iλ(ε). Any fertility value has a non-zero probability, but fertility values that are further away from the mean have low probability. IBM Models 3, 4, and 5 use a multinomial distribution for fertility, which has a much larger number of parameters to learn.

However, this sampling method needs a large amount of communication between machines in order to keep the parameters up to date if we compute the expected counts in parallel. Instead, we do “batch learning”: we fix the parameters, scan through the entire corpus and compute expected counts in parallel (E-step); then combine all the counts together and update the parameters (Mstep). This is analogous to what IBM models and the HMM do in the EM algorithms. The algorithm for the E-step on one machine (all machines are in-dependent) is in Algorithm 1.","For the fertility hidden Markov model, updating P (aJ","1 , f J","1 |e2I+1","1 ) whenever we change the alignment aj can be done in constant time, so the complexity of choosing t samples for all aj (j = 1, 2, . . . , J ) is O(tIJ ).

Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem because all infrequent words tend to have larger fertility than they should. We solve the problem in the following way: estimate the parameter λ(enon empty) for all non-empty words, all infrequent words share this parameter.
