However, little research has been done on how to effectively perform SRL on bitext, which has important applications including machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009). A conventional way to perform SRL on bitext is performing SRL on each side of bitext separately, as has been done by Fung et al. (2007) on Chinese-English bitext. However, it is very difficult to obtain good SRL results on both sides of bitext in this way. The reason is that even the state-of-the-art SRL systems do not have very high accuracy on both English text (Màrquez et al., 2008; Pradhan et al., 2008; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2008), and Chinese text (Che et al., 2008; Xue, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009).","On the other hand, the semantic equivalence between two sides of bitext means that they should have consistent predicate-argument structures. This bilingual argument structure consistency can guide us to find better SRL results. For example, in Figure 1(a), the argument structure consistency can guide us to choose a correct SRL result on Chinese side. Consistency between two argument structures is reflected by sound argument alignments between them, as shown in Figure 1(b). Previous research has shown that bilingual constraints can be very helpful for parsing (Burkett and Klein, 2008; Huang et al., 2008). In this paper, we show that the bilingual argument structure consistency can be leveraged to substantially improve SRL results on both sides of bitext.","Formally, we present a joint inference model to preform bilingual SRL. Using automatic word alignment on bitext, we first identify a pair of predicates that align with each other. And we use monolingual SRL systems to produce argument candidates for each predicate. Then, our model jointly generate SRL results for both predicates from their argument candidates, using integer linear programming (ILP) technique. An overview of our approach is shown in Figure 2.","Our joint inference model consists of three components: the source side, the target side, and the ar-304 In recent years the pace of opening up to the outside of China s̀ construction market has further accelerated [ AM-TMP ] [ A1 ] [ A2 ] [ Pred ] R1: [ A1 ] [ AM-TMP ] [ C-A1 ] [ AM-ADV ] [Pred] R2: [ A1 ] [ AM-ADV ] [Pred]","中国 建筑 市场 近年 来 对 外 开放 步伐 进一步 加快 zhongguo jianzhu shichang jinnian lai dui wai kaifang bufa jinyibu jiakuai [ AM-TMP ] [  A1  ] [ A2 ] [ Pred ] In recent years the pace of opening up to the outside of China s̀ construction market has further accelerated 中国 建筑 市场 近年 来 对 外 开放 步伐 进一步 加快 [ A1 ][ AM-TMP ][ C-A1 ] [AM-ADV] [Pred] (a) Word alignment and SRL results for a Chinese-English predicate pair.

In (a), the SRL results are generated by the state-of-the-art monolingual SRL systems. The English SRL result is correct.

The Chinese SRL result in the row marked by ‘R1’ is correct and consistent with the result on English side. Whereas the result in the row marked by ‘R2’ is incorrect and inconsistent with the result on English side, with the circles showing their inconsistency.

These three components correspond to three interrelated factors: the quality of the SRL result on source side, the quality of the SRL result on target side, and the argument structure consistency between the SRL results on both sides. To evaluate the consistency between the two argument structures in our joint inference model, we formulate a log-linear model to compute the probability of aligning two arguments. Experiments on Chinese-English parallel PropBank shows that our model significantly outperforms monolingual SRL combination systems on both Chinese and English sides.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work.

(2004; 2008) formulated an ILP model for SRL. Koomen et al. (2005) combined several SRL outputs using ILP method. Màrquez et al. (2005) and Pradhan et al. (2005) proposed combination strategies that are not based on ILP method. Surdeanu et al. (2007) did a complete research on a variety of combination strategies. Zhuang and Zong (2010) proposed a minimum error weighting combination strategy for Chinese SRL combination.","Research on SRL utilizing parallel corpus is also related to our work. Padó and Lapata (2009) did research on cross-lingual annotation projection on English-German parallel corpus. They performed SRL only on the English side, and then mapped the English SRL result to German side. Fung et al. (2007) did pioneering work on studying argument alignment on Chinese-English parallel PropBank. They performed SRL on Chinese and English sides separately. Then, given the SRL result on both sides, they automatically induced the argument alignment between two sides.","The major difference between our work and all existing research is that our model performs SRL inference on two sides of bitext simultaneously. In our 305 model, we jointly consider three interrelated factors: SRL result on the source side, SRL result on the target side, and the argument alignment between them."]},{"title":"3 Generating Candidates for Inference3.1 Monolingual SRL System","paragraphs":["As shown in Figure 2, we need to use a monolingual SRL system to generate candidates for our joint inference model. We have implemented a monolingual SRL system which utilize full phrase-structure parse trees to perform SRL. In this system, the whole SRL process is comprised of three stages: pruning, argument identification, and argument classification. In the pruning stage, the heuristic pruning method in (Xue, 2008) is employed. In the argument identification stage, a number of argument locations are identified in a sentence. In the argument classification stage, each location identified in the previous stage is assigned a semantic role label. Maximum entropy classifier is employed for both the argument identification and classification tasks. And Zhang Le’s MaxEnt toolkit1","is used for implementation.","We use the monolingual SRL system described above for both Chinese and English SRL tasks. For the Chinese SRL task, the features used in this paper are the same with those used in (Xue, 2008). For the English SRL task, the features used are the same with those used in (Pradhan et al., 2008). 3.2 Output of the Monolingual SRL System The maximum entropy classifier in our monolingual SRL system can output classification probabilities. We use the classification probability of the argument classification stage as an argument’s probability. As illustrated in Figure 3, in an individual system’s output, each argument has three attributes: its location in sentence loc, represented by the number of its first word and last word; its semantic role label l; and its probability p.","So each argument outputted by a system is a triple (loc, l, p). For example, the A0 argument in Figure 3 is ((0, 2), A0, 0.94). Because these outputs are to be combined, we call such triple a candidate. 1 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent toolkit",".html Sent:       ⁄ ¥   ›    Args: [ A0 ] [Pred] [ A1 ] loc: (0, 2) (4, 7) l: A0 A1 p: 0.94 0.92 Figure 3: Three attributes of an output argument: location loc, label l, and probability p. 3.3 Generating and Merging Candidates To generate candidates for joint inference, we need to have multiple SRL results on each side of bitext. Therefore, for both Chinese and English SRL systems, we use the 3-best parse trees of Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and 1-best parse trees of Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) as inputs. All the three parsers are multilingual parsers. The second and third best parse trees of Berkeley parser are used for their good quality. Therefore, each monolingual SRL system produces 5 different outputs.","Candidates from different outputs may have the same loc and l but different p. So we merge all candidates with the same loc and l into one by averaging their probabilities. For a merged candidate (loc, l, p), we say that p is the probability of assigning l to loc."]},{"title":"4 Joint Inference Model","paragraphs":["Our model can be conceptually decomposed to three components: the source side, the target side, and the argument alignment. The objective function of our joint inference model is the weighted sum of three sub-objectives: max Os + λ1Ot + λ2Oa (1) where Os and Ot represent the quality of the SRL results on source and target sides, and Oa represents the soundness of the argument alignment between the SRL results on two sides, λ1, λ2 are positive weights corresponding to the importance of Ot and Oa respectively. 4.1 Components of Source and Target Sides 4.1.1 Source Side Component","The source side component aims to improve the SRL result on source side. This is equivalent to a 306","monolingual SRL combination problem.","For convenience, we denote the whole semantic","role label set for source language as {ls","1, ls","2, . . . , ls","Ls},","in which ls 1 ∼ ls","6 stand for the key argument labels","A0 ∼ A5 respectively. Suppose there are Ns differ-","ent locations, denoted as locs","1, . . . , locs","Ns, among all","candidates on the source side. The probability of as-","signing ls j to locs","i is ps","ij. An indicator variable xij is","defined as:","xij = [locs i is assigned label ls","j ]. Then the source side sub-objective Os in equation (1) is the sum of arguments’ probabilities on source side: Os = Ns ∑ i=1 Ls ∑","j=1(ps ij − Ts)xij (2) where Ts is a bias to prevent including too many candidates in solution (Surdeanu et al., 2007).","We consider the following two linguistically motivated constraints:","1. No duplication: There is no duplication for key arguments: A0 ∼ A5.","2. No overlapping: Arguments cannot overlap with each other.","In (Punyakanok et al., 2004), several more constraints are considered. According to (Surdeanu et al., 2007), however, no significant performance improvement can be obtained by considering more constraints than the two above. So we do not consider other constraints.","The inequalities in (3) make sure that each locs","i is assigned at most one label. ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : Ls ∑ j=1 xij ≤ 1 (3)","The inequalities in (4) satisfy the No duplication constraint. ∀1 ≤ j ≤ 6 : Ns ∑ i=1 xij ≤ 1 (4) For any source side location locs","i , let Ci denote","the index set of the locations that overlap with it.","Then the No overlapping constraint means that if","locs i is assigned a label, i.e., ∑Ns","j=1 xij = 1, then","for any u ∈ Ci, locs","u cannot be assigned any label, i.e., ∑Ns","j=1 xuj = 0. A common technique in ILP modeling to form such a constraint is to use a sufficiently large auxiliary constant M . And the constraint is formulated as:","∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : ∑","u∈Ci Ls ∑ j=1 xuj ≤ (1 − Ls","∑","j=1 xij)M (5) In this case, M only needs to be larger than the number of candidates to be combined. In this paper, M = 500 is large enough. 4.1.2 Target Side Component","In principle, the target side component of our joint","inference model is the same with the source side","component.","The whole semantic role label set for target lan-","guage is denoted by {lt","1, lt","2, . . . , lt","Lt}. There are","Nt different locations, denoted as loct","1, . . . , loct","Nt,","among all candidates in the target side.

The probability of assigning lt","j to loct","k is pt","kj.","An indicator variable ykj is defined as:","ykj = [loct k is assigned label lt","j]. Then the target side sub-objective Ot in equation (1) is: Ot = Nt ∑ k=1 Lt ∑","j=1(pt kj − Tt)ykj (6) The constraints on target side are as follows: Each loct","k is assigned at most one label: ∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : Lt ∑ j=1 ykj ≤ 1 (7) The No duplication constraint: ∀1 ≤ j ≤ 6 : Nt ∑ k=1 ykj ≤ 1 (8) The No overlapping constraint:","∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : ∑","v∈Ck Lt ∑ j=1 yvj ≤ (1− Lt","∑","j=1 ykj)M (9) In (9), Ck denotes the index set of the locations that overlap with loct","k, and the constant M is set to 500 in this paper. 307 4.2 Argument Alignment","The argument alignment component is the core of","our joint inference model. It gives preference to the","bilingual SRL results that have more consistent ar-","gument structures. For a source side argument args","i = (locs","i , ls",") and","a target side argument argt","k = (loct","k, lt","), let zik be","the following indicator variable:","zik = [args i aligns with argt","k].","We use pa ik to represent the probability that args","i and","argt","k align with each other, i.e., pa","ik = P (zik = 1).","We call pa ik the argument alignment probability","between args","i and argt","k. 4.2.1 Argument Alignment Probability Model We use a log-linear model to compute the argu-","ment alignment probability pa","ik between args","i and","argt k. Let (s, t) denote a bilingual sentence pair and","wa denote the word alignment on (s, t). Our log-","linear model defines a distribution on zik given the","tuple tup = (args","i , argt","k, wa, s, t):","P (zik|tup) ∝ exp(wT φ(tup)) where φ(tup) is the feature vector. With this model, pa ik can be computed as pa","ik = P (zik = 1|tup).","In order to study the argument alignment in corpus and to provide training data for our log-linear model, we have manually aligned the arguments in 60 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0180.fid) of Chinese-English parallel PropBank. On this data set, we get the argument alignment matrix in Table 1. Ch\\En A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 AM* NUL A0 492 30 4 0 0 0 46 A1 98 853 43 2 0 0 8 A2 9 57 51 1 0 47 0 A3 1 0 2 6 0 0 0 A4 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 AM* 0 2 39 0 0 895 221 NUL 53 14 27 0 0 45 0 Table 1: The argument alignment matrix on manually aligned corpus.","Each entry in Table 1 is the number of times for which one type of Chinese argument aligns with one type of English argument. AM* stands for all adjuncts types like AM-TMP, AM-LOC, etc., and NUL means that the argument on the other side cannot be aligned with any argument on this side. For example, the number 46 in the A0 row and NUL column means that Chinese A0 argument cannot be aligned with any argument on English side for 46 times in our manually aligned corpus.","We use the following features in our model. Word alignment feature: If there are many word-to-word alignments between args","i and argt","k, then it is very probable that args","i and argt","k would align with each other. We adopt the method used in (Padó and Lapata, 2009) to measure the word-to-word alignments between args","i and argt","k. And the word alignment feature is defined as same as the word alignment-based word overlap in (Padó and Lapata, 2009). Note that this is a real-valued feature. Head word alignment feature: The head word of an argument is usually more representative than other words. So we use whether the head words of args","i and argt","k align with each other as a binary feature. The use of this feature is inspired by the work in (Burkett and Klein, 2008). Semantic role labels of two arguments: From Table 1, we can see that semantic role labels of two arguments are a good indicator of whether they should align with each other. For example, a Chinese A0 argument aligns with an English A0 argument most of the times, and never aligns with an English AM* argument in Table 1. Therefore, the semantic role labels of args","i and argt","k are used as a feature. Predicate verb pair: Different predicate pairs have different argument alignment patterns. Let’s take the Chinese predicate /zengzhang and the English predicate grow as an example. The argument alignment matrix for all instances of the Chinese-English predicate pair (zengzhang, grow) in our manually aligned corpus is shown in Table 2. CH \\EN A0 A1 A2 AM* NUL A0 0 16 0 0 0 A1 0 0 12 0 0 AM* 0 0 4 7 10 NUL 0 0 0 2 0 Table 2: The argument alignment matrix for the predicate pair (zengzhang, grow).","From Table 2 we can see that all A0 arguments of zengzhang align with A1 arguments of grow. This 308 is very different from the results in Table 1, where a Chinese A0 argument tends to align with an English A0 argument. This phenomenon shows that a predicate pair can determine which types of arguments should align with each other. Therefore, we use the predicate pair as a feature. 4.2.2 Argument Alignment Component","The argument alignment sub-objective Oa in equation (1) is the sum of argument alignment probabilities: Oa = Ns ∑ i=1 Nt ∑","k=1(pa ik − Ta)zik (10) where Ta is a bias to prevent including too many alignments in final solution, and pa","ik is computed using the log-linear model described in subsection 4.2.1.","Oa reflects the consistency between argument structures on two sides of bitext. Larger Oa means better argument alignment between two sides, thus indicates more consistency between argument structures on two sides.","The following constraints are considered:","1. Conformity with bilingual SRL result. For all candidates on both source and target sides, only those that are chosen to be arguments on each side can be aligned.","2. One-to-many alignment limit. Each argument can not be aligned with more than 3 arguments.","3. Complete argument alignment. Each argument on source side must be aligned with at least one argument on target side, and vice versa.","The Conformity with bilingual SRL result constraint is necessary to validly integrate the bilingual SRL result with the argument alignment. This constraint means that if args","i and argt","k align with each other, i.e., zik = 1, then locs","i must be assigned a label on source side, i.e., ∑Ls","j=1 xij = 1, and loct","k must be assigned a label on target side, i.e., ∑Lt","j=1 ykj = 1. So this constraint can be represented as: ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns, 1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : Ls ∑ j=1 xij ≥ zik (11) ∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt, 1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : Lt ∑ j=1 ykj ≥ zik (12)","The One-to-many alignment limit constraint comes from our observation on manually aligned corpus. We have found that no argument aligns with more than 3 arguments in our manually aligned corpus. This constraint can be represented as: ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : Nt ∑ k=1 zik ≤ 3 (13) ∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : Ns ∑ i=1 zik ≤ 3 (14)","The Complete argument alignment constraint comes from the semantic equivalence between two sides of bitext. For each source side location locs","i , if it is assigned a label, i.e., ∑Ls","j=1 xij = 1, then it must be aligned with some arguments on target side, i.e., ∑Nt","k=1 zik ≥ 1. This can be represented as: ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : Nt ∑ k=1 zik ≥ Ls ∑ j=1 xij (15) Similarly, each target side argument must be aligned to at least one source side argument. This can be represented as: ∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : Ns ∑ i=1 zik ≥ Lt ∑ j=1 ykj (16) 4.3 Complete Argument Alignment as a Soft Constraint Although the hard Complement argument alignment constraint is ideally reasonable, in real situations this constraint does not always hold. The manual argument alignment result shown in Table 1 indicates that in some cases an argument cannot be aligned with any argument on the other side (see the NUL row and column in Table 1). Therefore, it would be reasonable to change the hard Complement argument alignment constraint to a soft one. To do so, we need to remove the hard Complement argument alignment constraint and add penalty for violation of this constraint.","If an argument does not align with any argument on the other side, we say it aligns with NUL. And we define the following indicator variables: zi,NUL = [args","i aligns with NUL], 1 ≤ i ≤ Ns. 309 zNUL,k = [argt","k aligns with NUL], 1 ≤ k ≤ Nt. Then ∑Ns","i=1 zi,NUL is the number of source side arguments that align with NUL. And ∑Nt","k=1 zNUL,k is the number of target side arguments that align with NUL. For each argument that aligns with NUL, we add a penalty λ3 to the argument alignment sub-objective Oa. Therefore, the sub-objective Oa in equation (10) is changed to: Oa = Ns ∑ i=1 Nt ∑","k=1(pa ik − Ta)zik −λ3( Ns ∑ i=1 zi,NUL + Nt ∑ k=1 zNUL,k) (17)","From the definition of zi,NUL, it is obvious that, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ Ns, zi,NUL and zik(1 ≤ k ≤ Nt) have the following relationship: If ∑Nt","k=1 zik ≥ 1, i.e., args","i aligns with some arguments on target side, then zi,NUL = 0; Otherwise, zi,NUL = 1. These relationships can be captured by the following constraints: ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns, 1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : zi,NUL ≤ 1−zik (18) ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : Nt ∑ k=1 zik + zi,NUL ≥ 1 (19)","Similarly, for any 1 ≤ k ≤ Nt, zNUL,k and zik(1 ≤ i ≤ Ns) observe the following constraints:","∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt, 1 ≤ i ≤ Ns : zNUL,k ≤ 1 − zik (20) ∀1 ≤ k ≤ Nt : Ns ∑ i=1 zik + zNUL,k ≥ 1 (21) 4.4 Models Summary So far, we have presented two versions of our joint inference model. The first version treats Complement argument alignment as a hard constraint. We will refer to this version as Joint1. The objective function of Joint1 is defined by equations (1, 2, 6, 10). And the constraints of Joint1 are defined by equations (3-5, 7-9, 11-16).","The sencond version treats Complement argument alignment as a soft constraint. We will refer to this version as Joint2. The objective function of Joint2 is defined by equations (1, 2, 6, 17). And the constraints of Joint2 are defined by equations (3-5, 7-9, 11-14, 18-21).","Our baseline models are monolingual SRL combination models. We will refer to the source side combination model as SrcCmb. The objective of SrcCmb is to maximize Os, which is defined in equation (2). And the constraints of SrcCmb are defined by equations (3-5). Similarly, we will refer to the target side combination model as TrgCmb. The objective of TrgCmb is to maximize Ot defined in equation (6). And the constraints of TrgCmb are defined by equations (7-9). In this paper, we employ lpsolve2","to solve all ILP models."]},{"title":"5 Experiments5.1 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["In our experiments, we use the Xinhua News portion of Chinese and English data in LDC OntoNotes Release 3.0.

It contains parallel proposition annotations for 325 files (chtb 0001.fid to chtb 0325.fid) from Chinese-English parallel Treebank. The English part of this data contains proposition annotations only for verbal predicates. Therefore, we only consider verbal predicates in this paper.","We employ the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) to perform automatic word alignment. Be-sides the parallel PropBank data, we use additional 4,500K Chinese-English sentence pairs3","to induce word alignments for both directions, with the default GIZA++ settings. The alignments are symmetrized using the intersection heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), which is known to produce high-precision alignments.","We use 80 files (chtb 0001.fid to chtb 0080.fid) as test data, and 40 files (chtb 0081.fid to chtb 0120.fid) as development data.

Unfortunately, the quality of automatic word alignment on one-to-many Chinese-English sentence pairs is usually very poor. So we only include one-to-one Chinese-English sentence pairs in all data. And not all predicates in a sentence pair can be included. Only bilingual predicate pairs are included. A bilingual predicate pair is defined to be a pair of predicates in bitext which align with each other in automatic word alignment. Table 3 shows how many sentences and predicates are included in each data set.

Our Chinese SRL system is trained on 640 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0931.fid) in Chinese Propbank 1.0. Because Xinhua News is a quite different domain from WSJ, the training set for our English SRL system includes not only Sections 02∼21 of WSJ data in English Propbank, but also 205 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0325.fid) in the English part of parallel PropBank. For Chinese, the syntactic parsers are trained on 640 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0931.fid) plus the broadcast news portion of Chinese Treebank 6.0. For English, the syntactic parsers are trained on the following data: Sections 02∼21 of WSJ data in English Treebank, 205 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0325.fid) of Xinhua News data in OntoNotes 3.0, and the Sinorama data in OntoNotes 3.0. We treat discontinuous and coreferential arguments in accordance to the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005). The first part of a discontinuous argument is labeled as it is, and the second part is labeled with a prefix “C-”. All coreferential arguments are labeled with a prefix “ R-”. 5.2 Tuning Parameters in Models The models Joint1, Joint2, SrcCmb, and TrgCmb have different parameters. For each model, we have automatically tuned its parameters on development set using Powell’s Mothod (Brent, 1973). Powell’s Method is a heuristic optimization algorithm that does not require the objective function to have an explicit analytical formula. For a monolingual model like SrcCmb or TrgCmb, our objective is to maximize the F1 score of the model’s result on development set. But a joint model, like Joint1 or Joint2, generates SRL results on both sides of bitext. So our objective is to maximize the sum of the two F1 scores of the model’s results for both Chinese and English on development set. For all models, we regard the parameters to be tuned as variables. Then we optimize our objective using Powell’s Method. The solution of this optimization is the values of parameters. To avoid finding poor local optimum, we perform the optimization 30 times with different initial parameter values, and choose the best solution found. The final parameter values are listed in Table 4.

The performance of these outputs on test set is shown in Table 5. In Table 5, O1∼O3 are the outputs using 3-best parse trees of Berkeley parser respectively, O4 and O5 are the outputs using the best parse trees of Stanford parser and Bikel parser respectively.","As specified in subsection 5.1, only a small part of English SRL training data is in the same domain with test data. Therefore, the English SRL result in Table 5 is not very impressive. But the Chinese SRL result is pretty good. 311 Side Outputs P (%) R(%) F1 O1 79.84 71.95 75.69 O2 78.53 70.32 74.20 Chinese O3 78.41 69.99 73.96 O4 73.21 67.13 70.04 O5 75.32 63.78 69.07 O1 77.13 70.42 73.62 O2 75.88 69.06 72.31 English O3 75.74 68.65 72.02 O4 71.57 66.11 68.73 O5 73.12 68.04 70.49 Table 5: The results of individual monolingual SRL outputs on test set. 5.4 Effects of Different Constraints The One-to-many limit and Complete argument alignment constraints in subsection 4.2.2 comes from our empirical knowledge. To investigate the effect of these two constraits, we remove them from our joint inference models one by one, and observe the performance variations on test set. The results are shown in Table 6. In Table 6, ‘c2’ refers to the One-to-many limit constraint, ‘c3’ refers to the Complete argument alignment constraint, and ‘-’ means removing. For example, ‘Joint1 - c2’ means removing the constraint ‘c2’ from the model Joint1. Recall that the only difference between Joint1 and Joint2 is that ‘c3’ is a hard constraint in Joint1, but a soft constraint in Joint2. Therefore, ‘Joint2 - c3’ and ‘Joint2 - c2 - c3’ do not appear in Table 6, because they are the same with ‘Joint1 - c3’ and ‘Joint1 - c2 - c3’ respectively. Model Side P (%) R(%) F1 Joint1 Chinese 82.95 75.21 78.89 Joint1 - c2 81.46 75.97 78.62 Joint1 - c3 82.36 74.68 78.33 Joint1 - c2 - c3 82.04 74.67 78.18 Joint2 83.35 76.04 79.53 Joint2 - c2 82.41 76.03 79.09 Joint1 English 79.38 75.16 77.21 Joint1 - c2 78.51 75.22 76.83 Joint1 - c3 78.66 74.55 76.55 Joint1 - c2 - c3 78.37 74.37 76.32 Joint2 79.64 76.18 77.87 Joint2 - c2 78.41 75.89 77.13 Table 6: Results of different joint models on test set.","From Table 6, we can see that the constraints ‘c2’ and ‘c3’ both have positive effect in our joint inference model, because removing any one of them causes performance degradation. And removing ‘c3’ from Joint1 causes more performance degrada-tion than removing ‘c2’. This means that ‘c3’ plays a more important role than ‘c2’ in our joint inference model. Indeed, by treating ‘c3’ as a soft constraint, the model Joint2 has the best performance on both sides of bitext. 5.5 Final Results We use Joint2 as our final joint inference model. And as specified in subsection 4.4, our baselines are monolingual SRL combination models: SrcCmb for Chinese, and TrgCmb for English. Note that SrcCmb and TrgCmb are basically the same as the state-of-the-art combination model in (Surdeanu et al., 2007) with No overlapping and No duplication constraints. The final results on test set are shown in Table 7. Side Model P (%) R(%) F1 Chinese SrcCmb 82.58 73.92 78.01 Joint2 83.35 76.04 79.53 English TrgCmb 79.02 73.44 76.13 Joint2 79.64 76.18 77.87 Table 7: Comparison between monolingual combination model and our joint inference model on test set.","From Table 5 and Table 7, we can see that SrcCmb and TrgCmb improve F1 scores over the best individual SRL outputs by 2.32 points and 2.51 points on Chinese and English seperately. Thus they form strong baselines for our joint inference model. Even so, our joint inference model still improves F1 score over SrcCmb by 1.52 points, and over TrgCmb by 1.74 points.","From Table 7, we can see that, despite only part of training data for English SRL system is in-domain, our joint inference model still produces good English SRL result. And the F1 score of Chinese SRL result reaches 79.53%, which represents the state-of-the-art Chinese SRL performance to date."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a joint inference model to perform bilingual SRL. Our joint inference model incorporates not only linguistic constraints on 312 source and target sides of bitext, but also the bilingual argument structure consistency requirement on bitext. Experiments on Chinese-English parallel PropBank show that our joint inference model is very effective for bilingual SRL. Compared to state-of-the-art monolingual SRL combination baselines, our joint inference model substantially improves SRL results on both sides of bitext. In fact, the solution of our joint inference model contains not only the SRL results on bitext, but also the optimal argument alignment between two sides of bitext. This makes our model especially suitable for application in machine translation, which needs to obtain the argument alignment."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The research work has been partially funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 60975053 and 60736014, the National Key Technology R&D Program under Grant No. 2006BAH03B02.
