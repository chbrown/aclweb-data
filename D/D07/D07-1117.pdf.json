Much research has been done to improve tagging performance for a variety of languages. The state-of-the-art systems have achieved an accuracy of 97% for English on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (which contains 4.5M words) using various models (Brants, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Thede and Harper, 1999). Lower accuracies have been reported in the literature for Mandarin POS tagging (Tseng et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2002). This is, in part, due to the relatively small size and the different annotation guidelines (e.g., granularity of the tag set) for the annotated corpus of Mandarin. Xue at el. (2002) and Tseng at el. (2005) reported accuracies of 93% and 93.74% on CTB-I (Xue et al., 2002) (100K words) and CTB 5.0 (500K words), respectively, each using a Maximum Entropy approach. The character-istics of Mandarin make it harder to tag than English. Chinese words tend to have greater POS tag ambiguity than English. Tseng at el. (2005) reported that 29.9% of the words in CTB have more than one POS assignment compared to 19.8% of the English words in WSJ. Moreover, the morphological properties of Chinese words complicate the prediction of POS type for unknown words.","These challenges for Mandarin POS tagging suggest the need to develop more sophisticated methods. In this paper, we investigate the use of a discriminative reranking approach to increase Mandarin tagging accuracy. Reranking approaches (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Chen et al., 2002; Collins and Koo, 2005; Ji et al., 2006; Roark et al., 2006) have been successfully applied to many NLP applications, including parsing, named entity recognition, sentence boundary detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, reranking approaches have not been used for POS tagging, possibly due to the already high levels of accuracy for English, which leave little room for further improvement. However, the relatively poorer performance of existing methods on Mandarin POS tagging makes reranking a much more compelling technique to evaluate. In this paper, we use reranking to improve tagging performance of an HMM tagger adapted to 1093 Mandarin. Hidden Markov models are simple and effective, but unlike discriminative models, such as Maximum Entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (John Lafferty, 2001), they have more difficulty utilizing a rich set of conditionally dependent features. This limitation can be overcome by utilizing reranking approaches, which are able to make use of the features extracted from the tagging hypotheses produced by the HMM tagger. Reranking also has advantages over MaxEnt and CRF models. It is able to use any features extracted from entire labeled sentences, including those that cannot be incorporated into MaxEnt and CRF models due to inference difficulties. In addition, reranking methods are able to utilize the information provided by N-best lists. Finally, the decoding phase of reranking is much simpler.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the HMM tagger in Section 2. We discuss the modifications to better handle unknown words in Mandarin and to enrich the word emission probabilities through the combination of bi-directional estimations. In Section 3, we first describe the reranking algorithm and then propose two methods to improve its performance. We also describe the features that will be used for Mandarin POS reranking in Section 3. Experimental results are given in Section 4. Conclusions and future work appear in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 The HMM Model 2.1 Porting English Tagger to Mandarin","paragraphs":["The HMM tagger used in this work is a second-order HMM tagger initially developed for English by Thede and Harper (1999). This state-of-the-art second-order HMM tagger uses trigram transition probability estimations, P (ti|ti−2ti−1), and trigram emission probability estimations, P (wi|ti−1ti). Let ti 1 denote the tag sequence t1, · · · , ti, and wi","1 denote the word sequence w1, · · · , wi. The tagging problem can be formally defined as finding the best tag sequence τ (wN","1 ) for the word sequence wN","1 of length","N as follows1 :","τ (wN","1 ) = arg max","tN","1","P (tN","1 |wN 1 ) = arg max","tN","1","P (tN 1 wN","1 )","P (wN","1 )","= arg max tN 1","P (tN 1 wN","1 ) (1)","= arg max tN 1 ∏ i","P (ti|ti−1","1 wi−1 1 )P (wi|ti","1wi−1","1 ) 1 We assume that symbols exist implicitly for boundary con-","ditions.","≈ arg max tN 1 ∏ i P (ti|ti−2ti−1)P (wi|ti−1ti) (2) The best tag sequence τ (wN","1 ) can be determined efficiently using the Viterbi algorithm.","For estimating emission probabilities of unknown words (i.e., words that do not appear in the training data) in English (and similarly for other inflected languages), a weighted sum of P (sk","i |ti−1ti) (with k up to four) was used as an approximation, where sk i is the suffix of length k of word wi (e.g., s1","i is the last character of word wi). The suffix information and three binary features (i.e., whether the word is capitalized, whether the word is hyphenated, and whether the word contains numbers) are combined to estimate the emission probabilities of unknown words.","The interpolation weights for smoothing transition, emission, and suffix probabilities were estimated using the log-based Thede smoothing method (Thede and Harper, 1999) as follows:","PThede(n-gram) = λ(n-gram)PML(n-gram) +","(1 − λ(n-gram))PThede((n-1)-gram) where:","PML(n-gram) = the ML estimation λ(n-gram) = f(n-gram count) f(x) =","loga(x + 1) + b loga(x + 1) + (b + 1)","While porting the HMM-based English POS tagger to Mandarin is fairly straightforward for words seen in the training data, some thought is required to handle unknown words due to the morphology differences between the two languages. First, in Mandarin, there is no capitalization and no hyphenation. Second, although Chinese has morphology, it is not the same as in English; words tend to contain far fewer characters than inflected words in English, so word endings will tend to be short, say one or two characters long. Hence, in our baseline model (denoted HMM baseline), we simply utilize word endings of up to two characters in length along with a binary feature of whether the word contains numbers or not. In the next two subsections, we describe two ways in which we enhance this simple HMM baseline model. 1094","2.2 Improving the Mandarin Unknown Word Model Chinese words are quite different from English words, and the word formation process for Chinese words can be quite complex (Packard, 2000). In-deed, the last characters in a Chinese word are, in some cases, most informative of the POS type, while for others, it is the characters at the beginning. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a character in the middle of a word to provide some evidence for the POS type of the word. Hence, we chose to employ a rather simple but effective method to estimate the emission probability, P (wi|ti−1, ti), of an unknown word, wi. We use the geometric average2","of the emission probability of the characters in the word, i.e., P (ck|ti−1, ti) with ck being the k-th character in the word. Since some of the characters in wi may not have appeared in any word tagged as ti in that context in the training data, only characters that are observed in this context are used in the computation of the geometric average, as shown below: P (wi|ti−1, ti) = n√ ∏","c","k∈w","i,P(c","k|t","i−1,t","i)̸=0 P (ck|ti−1, ti) (3) where n = |{ck ∈ wi|P (ck|ti−1, ti) ̸= 0}| 2.3 Bi-directional Word Probability Estimation In Equation 2, the word emission probability P (wi|ti−1ti) is a left-to-right prediction that depends on the current tag ti associated with wi, as well as its previous tag ti−1. Although the interaction between wi and the next tag ti+1 is captured to some extent when ti+1 is generated by the model, this implicit interaction may not be as effective as adding the information more directly to the model. Hence, we chose to apply the constraint explicitly in our HMM framework by replacing P (wi|ti−1ti) in Equation 2 with P λ","(w","i|ti−1ti)P 1−λ (w i|titi+1) for","both known and unknown words, with τ (wN","1 ) determined by:","τ (wN","1 ) = arg max","tN","1 ∏ i (P (ti|ti−2ti−1) ×","P λ (wi|ti−1ti)P 1−λ","(wi|titi+1)) (4) 2 Based on preliminary testing, the geometric average pro-","vided greater tag accuracy than the arithmetic average. This corresponds to a mixture model of two genera-tion paths, one from the left and one from the right, to approximate τ (wN","1 ) in Equation 1 in a different way.","τ (wN","1 ) = arg max","tN","1","P (tN 1 wN","1 )","= arg max tN 1","P (tN","1 )P (wN","1 |tN","1 )","P (tN 1 ) ≈ ∏ i P (ti|ti−1ti−2)","P (wN","1 |tN","1 ) = P λ","(wN 1 |tN","1 )P 1−λ","(wN","1 |tN","1 ) ≈ ∏ i","P λ (w","i|ti−1ti)P 1−λ (wi|titi+1) In this case, the decoding process involves the computation of three local probabilities, i.e., P (ti|ti−2ti−1), P (wi|ti−1ti), and P (wi|titi+1). By using a simple manipulation that shifts the time index of P (wi|titi+1) in Equation 4 by two time slices3","(i.e., by replacing P (w","i|titi+1) with P (wi−2|ti−2ti−1)), we are able to compute τ (wN","1 ) in Equation 4 with the same asymptotic time complexity of decoding as in Equation 2."]},{"title":"3 Discriminative Reranking","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe our use of the RankBoost-based (Freund and Schapire, 1997; Freund et al., 1998) discriminative reranking approach that was originally developed by Collins and Koo (2005) for parsing. It provides an additional avenue for improving tagging accuracy, and also allows us to investigate the impact of various features on Mandarin tagging performance. The reranking algorithm takes as input a list of candidates produced by some probabilistic model, in our case the HMM tagger, and reranks these candidates based on a set of features. We first introduce Collins’ reranking algorithm in Subsection 3.1, and then describe two modifications in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3 that were designed to improve the generalization performance of the reranking algorithm for our POS tagging task. The reranking features that are used for POS tagging are then described in Subsection 3.4. 3.1 Collins’ Reranking Algorithm For training the reranker for the POS tagging task, there are n sentences {si : i = 1, · · · , n} each with ni candidates {xi,j : j = 1, · · · , ni} along with","3","Replacing P (wi|titi+1) with P (wi−1|ti−1ti) also gives the same solution. 1095 the log-probability L(xi,j) produced by the HMM tagger. Each tagging candidate xi,j in the training data has a “goodness” score Score(xi,j) that measures the similarity between the candidate and the gold reference. For tagging, we use tag accuracy as the similarity measure. Without loss of generality, we assume that xi,1 has the highest score, i.e., Score(xi,1) ≥ Score(xi,j) for j = 2, · · · , ni. To summarize, the training data consists of a set of examples {xi,j : i = 1, · · · , n; j = 1, · · · , ni}, each along with a “goodness” score Score(xi,j) and a log-probability L(xi,j).","A set of indicator functions {hk : k = 1, · · · , m} are used to extract binary features {hk(xi,j) : k = 1, · · · , m} on each example xi,j. An example of an indicator function for POS tagging is given below:","h2143(x) = 1 if x contains n-gram “go/VV to” 0 otherwise Each indicator function hk is associated with a weight parameter αk which is real valued. In addition, a weight parameter α0 is associated with the log-probability L(xi,j). The ranking function of candidate xi,j is defined as α0L(xi,j) + m∑ k=1 αkhk(xi,j).","The objective of the training process is to set the parameters ᾱ = {α0, α1, · · · , αm} to minimize the following loss function Loss( ᾱ) (which is an upper bound on the training error): Loss(ᾱ) = ∑ i n i ∑ j=2","Si,je−M i,j(ᾱ) where Si,j is the weight function that gives the importance of each example, and Mi,j( ᾱ) is the margin:","Si,j = Score(xi,1) − Score(xi,j)","Mi,j(ᾱ) = α0(L(xi,1) − L(xi,j)) +","m","∑ k=1 αk(hk(xi,1) − hk(xi,j))","All of the αi’s are initially set to zero. The value of α0 is determined first to minimize the loss function and is kept fixed afterwards.

For each k ∈ {1, · · · , m}, (hk(xi,1) − hk(xi,j)) can only take one of the three values: +1, -1, or 0. Thus the training examples can be divided into three subsets with respect to k: A+ k = {(i, j) : (hk(xi,1) − hk(xi,j)) = +1} A− k = {(i, j) : (hk(xi,1) − hk(xi,j)) = −1} A0 k = {(i, j) : (hk(xi,1) − hk(xi,j)) = 0}","The new loss after adding the update parameter δ to the parameter αk is shown below: Loss(ᾱ, k, δ) = ∑","(i,j)∈A+ k","Si,je−M i,j(ᾱ)−δ","+ ∑","(i,j)∈A− k","Si,je−M i,j(ᾱ)+δ","+ ∑","(i,j)∈A0 k","Si,je−M i,j(ᾱ)","= e−δ","W +","k + eδ","W −","k + W 0","k The best feature/update pair (k∗",", δ∗",") that minimizes Loss( ᾱ, k, δ) is determined using the following for-mulas:","k∗ = arg max","k ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣","√ W +","k − √","W − k ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ (5)","δ∗ = 1","2 log W + k∗ W − k∗ (6)","The update formula in Equation 6 is problematic when either W +","k∗ or W −","k∗ is zero. W +","k is zero if hk never takes on a value 1 for any xi,1 with value 0 on a corresponding xi,j for j = 2, · · · , ni (and similarly for W −","k ). Collins introduced a smoothing parameter ε to address this problem, resulting in a slight modification to the update formula:","δ∗ = 1","2 log W + k∗ + εZ W − k∗ + εZ (7)","The value of ε plays an important role in this formula. If ε is set too small, the smoothing factor εZ would not prevent setting δ∗","to a potentially overly large absolute value, resulting in over-fitting. If ε is set too large, then the opposite condition of under-training could result. The value of ε is determined based on a development set. 1096 3.2 Update Once Collins’ method allows multiple updates to the weight of a feature based on Equations 5 and 7. We found that for those features for which either W +","k or W −","k equals zero, the update formula in Equation 7 can only increase their weight (in absolute value) in one direction. Although these features are strong and useful, setting their weights too large can be undesirable in that it limits the use of other features for reducing the loss.","Based on this analysis, we have developed and evaluated an update-once method, in which we use the update formula in Equation 7 but limit weight updates so that once a feature is selected on a certain iteration and its weight parameter is updated, it cannot be updated again. Using this method, the weights of the strong features are not allowed to prevent additional features from being considered during the training phase. 3.3 Regularized Reranking Although the update-once method may attenuate over-fitting to some extent, it also prevents adjust-ing the value of any weight parameter that is initially set too high or too low in an earlier boosting round. In order to design a more sophisticated weight update method that allows multiple updates in both directions while penalizing overly large weights, we have also investigated the addition of a regularization term R( ᾱ), an exponential function of ᾱ, to the loss function: RegLoss(ᾱ) = ∑ i n i ∑ j=2","Si,je−M i,j(ᾱ)","+ R(ᾱ) R(ᾱ) = m ∑ k=1","pk · (e−α k + eα","k","− 2) where pk is the penalty weight of parameter αk. The reason that we chose this form of regularization is that (e−αk","+ eαk","− 2) is a symmetric, monotonically decreasing function of |αk|, and more importantly it provides a closed analytical expression of the weight update formula similar to Equations 5 and 6. Hence, the best feature/update pair for the regularized loss function is defined as follows:","k∗ = arg max","k ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ √","W +","k + pke−α","k","− √","W − k + pke+α","k ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣","δ∗ = 1","2 log","W +","k∗ + pk∗","e−α","k∗","W −","k∗ + pk∗","e+α","k∗","There are many ways of choosing pk, the penalty weight of αk. In this paper, we use the values of β · (W +","k + W −","k ) at the beginning of the first iteration (after α0 is determined) for pk, where β is a weighting parameter to be tuned on the development set. The regularized weight update formula has many advantages. It is always well defined no matter what value W +","k and W −","k take, in contrast to Equation 6. For all features, even in the case when either W +","k or W −","k equals zero, the regularized update formula allows weight updates in two directions. If the weight is small, W +","k and W −","k have more impact on determining the weight update direction, however, when the weight becomes large, the regularization factors pke−α","and pke+α","favor reducing the weight. 3.4 Reranking Features A reranking model has the flexibility of incorporat-ing any type of feature extracted from N-best candidates. For the work presented in this paper, we examine three types of features. For each window of three word/tag pairs, we extract all the n-grams, except those that are comprised of only one word/tag pair, or only tags, or only words, or do not include either the word or tag in the center word/tag pair. These constitute the n-gram feature set.","In order to better handle unknown words, we also extract the two most important types of morphological features5","that were utilized in (Tseng et al., 2005) for those words that appear no more than seven times (following their convention) in the training set:","Affixation features: we use character n-gram prefixes and suffixes for n up to 4. For example, for word/tag pair D /NN (Information-Bag, i.e., folder), we add the following features: (prefix1, D, NN), (prefix2, D, NN), (prefix3, D, NN), (suffix1, , NN), (suffix2, , NN), (suffix3, D, NN). AffixPOS features6",": we used the training set to","build a prefix/POS and suffix/POS dictionary","associating possible tags with each prefix and 5 Tseng at el. also used other morphological features that","require additional resources to which we do not have access. 6 AffixPOS features are somewhat different from the CTB-","Morph features used in (Tseng et al., 2005), where a mor-","pheme/POS dictionary with the possible tags for all morphemes","in the training set was used instead of two separate dictionaries","for prefix and suffix. AffixPOS features perform slightly better","in our task than the CTB-morph features. 1097 suffix in the training set. The AffixPOS features indicate the set of tags a given affix could have. For the same example D/NN, D occurred as prefix in both NN and VV words in the training data. So we add the following features based on the prefix D: (prefix, D, NN, 1, NN), (prefix, D, VV, 1, NN), and (prefix, D, X, 0, NN) for every tag X not in {NN, VV}, where 1 and 0 are indicator values. Features are extracted in the similar way for the suffix .","The n-gram and morphological features are easy to compute, however, they have difficulty in captur-ing the long distance information related to syntactic relationships that might help POS tagging accuracy. In order to examine the effectiveness of utilizing syntactic information in tagging, we have also experimented with dependency features that are extracted based on automatic parse trees. First a bracketing parser (the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) in our case) is used to generate the parse tree of a sentence, then the const2dep tool developed by Hwa was utilized to convert the bracketing tree to a dependency tree based on the head percolation table developed by the second author. The dependency tree is comprised of a set of dependency relations among word pairs. A dependency relation is a triple ⟨word-a, word-b, relation⟩, in which word-a is governed by word-b with gram-matical relation denoted as relation. For example, in the sentence “ (̌Tibet) ̌N(economy) œ (construction) (achieves) > W(significant) Ø(accomplishments)”, one example dependency relation is ⟨, Ø, mod⟩. Given these dependency relations, we then extract dependency features (in total 36 features for each relation) by examining the POS tags of the words for each tagging candidate of a sentence. The relative positions of the word pairs are also taken into account for some features. For example, if and Ø in the above sentence are tagged as VV and NN respectively in one candidate, then two example dependency features are (dep-1, , VV, Ø, NN, mod), (dep-14, , VV, NN, right, mod), in which dep-1 and dep-14 are feature types and right indicates that word-b () is to the right of word-a (Ø)."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Data","paragraphs":["The most recently released Penn Chinese Treebank 5.2 (denoted CTB, released by LDC) is used in our experiments. It contains 500K words, 800K characters, 18K sentences, and 900 data files, including articles from the Xinhua news agency (China-Mainland), Information Services Department of HKSAR (Hongkong), and Sinorama magazine (Taiwan). Its format is similar to the English WSJ Penn Treebank, and it was carefully annotated. There are 33 POS tags used, to which we add tags to discriminate among punctuation types. The original POS tag for punctuation was PU; we created new POS tags for each distinct punctuation type (e.g., PU-?).","The CTB corpus was collected during different time periods from different sources with a diversity of articles. In order to obtain a representative split of training, development, and test sets, we divide the whole corpus into blocks of 10 files by sorted order. For each block, the first file is used for development, the second file is used for test, and the remaining 8 files are used for training. Table 1 gives the basic statistics on the data. The development set is used to determine the parameter λ in Equation 4, the smoothing parameter ε in Equation 7, the weight parameter β described in Section 3.3, and the number of boosting rounds in the reranking model. In order to train the reranking model, the method in (Collins and Koo, 2005) is used to prepare the N-best training examples. We divided the training set into 20 chunks, with each chunk N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the combination of the other 19 chunks. The development set is N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the training set, and the test set is N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the combination of the training set and the development set.","Train Dev Test #Sentences 14925 1904 1975 #Words 404844 51243 52900 Table 1: The basic statistics on the data.","In the following subsections, we will first examine the HMM models alone to determine the best HMM configuration to use to generate the N-best candidates, and then evaluate the reranking models.

Note that emission probabilities of unknown words are estimated based on characters using the same λ for combination. When λ = 1.0, the model uses only the standard left-to-right prediction of words, while when λ = 0 it uses only the right-to-left estimation. It is interesting to note that the right-to-left estimation results in greater accuracy than the left-to-right estimation. This might be because there is stronger interaction between a word and its next tag. Also as shown in Figure 1, the estimations in the two directions are complementary to each other, with λ = 0.5 performing best. The performance of the HMM taggers on the test set is given in Table 2 for the best operating point, as well as the two other extreme operating points to compare the left-to-right and right-to-left constraints. Our best HMM tagger further improves the tag accuracy significantly from 93.43% (λ = 1.0) to 94.01% (λ = 0.5).

As shown in Table 3, a maximum of 100-Best provides a reasonable margin for improvement in the reranking task.","We first test the performance of the reranking methods using only the n-gram feature set, which contains around 18 million features. Later, we will investigate the addition of morphological features and dependency features. The smoothing parameter ε (for Collins’ method and the update-once method) and the weight parameter β (for the regularization method) both have great impact on reranking performance.

Although introducing the smoothing parameter ε in Equation 7 prevents infinite weight values, the update to the feature weights is no longer optimal (in terms of minimizing the error function). Since the update is not optimal, subsequent iterations may still focus on these features (and thus ignore other weaker but informative features) and always increase their weights in one direction, leading to biased training.","The update-once method at each iteration selects a new feature that has the most impact in reducing the training loss function. It has the advantage of preventing increasingly large weights from being assigned to the strong features, enabling the update of other features. The regularization method allows multiple updates and also penalizes large weights. Once a feature is selected and has its weight updated, no matter how strong the feature is, the weight value is optimal in terms of the current weights of other features, so that the training algorithm would choose another feature to update. A previously selected feature may be selected again if it becomes suboptimal due to a change in the weights of other features.","#iterations #features percent Collins 115400 10020 8.68% Update-once 545100 545100 100% Regularized 92500 70131 75.82% Table 5: The number of iterations (for the best performance), the number of selected features, and the percentage of selected features, by Collins’ method, the update-once method, and the regularization method on the development set.","Overall Known Unknown HMM, λ=0.5 94.01% 95.21% 75.15% Collins 94.44% 95.55% 77.05% Update-once 94.68% 95.68% 78.91% Regularized 94.64% 95.71% 77.84% Table 6: The performance on the test set of the HMM tagger and the reranking methods using n-gram and morphological features.","We next add morphological features to the n-gram features selected by the reranking methods7",". As can be seen by comparing Table 6 to Table 4, morphological features improve the tagging accuracy of unknown words. It should be noted that the improvement made by both update-one and regularization methods is statistically significant over using n-gram features alone; however, the improvement by Collins’ original method is not significant. This suggests that the two new methods are able to utilize a greater variety of features than the original method.","We trained several Charniak parsers using the same method for the HMM taggers to generate automatic parse trees for training, development, and test data. The update-once method is used to evaluate the effectiveness of dependency features for reranking, as shown in Table 7. The parser has an overall tagging accuracy that is greater than that of the best HMM tagger, but worse than that of the reranking models using n-gram and morphological features. It is interesting to note that reranking with the dependency features alone improves the tagging accuracy significantly, outperforming reranking models using n-gram and morphological features. This suggests that the long distance features based on the syntactic structure of the sentence are very beneficial for POS tagging of Mandarin. Moreover, n-gram and morphological features are complementary to the dependency features, with their combination performing the best. The n-gram features improve the accuracy on known words, while the morphological features improve the accuracy on unknown words. The best accuracy of 95.11% is an 18% relative reduction in error compared to the best HMM tagger.","7","Because the size of the combined feature set of all n-gram features and morphological features is too large to be handled by our server, we chose to add morphological features to the n-gram features selected by the reranking methods, and then retrain the reranking model. 1100","Overall Known Unknown Parser 94.31% 95.57% 74.52%","dep 94.93% 96.01% 77.87% dep+ngram 95.00% 96.11% 77.49% dep+morph 94.98% 96.01% 78.79%","dep+ngram+morph 95.11% 96.12% 79.32% Table 7: The tagging performance of the parser and the update-once reranking models with dependency features and their combination with n-gram and morphological features. 4.4 Comparison to Previous Work So how is our performance compared to previous work? When working on the same training/test data (CTB5.0 with the same pre-processing procedures) as in (Tseng et al., 2005), our HMM model obtained an accuracy of 93.72%, as compared to their 93.74% accuracy. Our reranking model8","using n-gram and morphological features improves the accuracy to 94.16%. Note that we did not use all the morphological features as in (Tseng et al., 2005), which would probably provide additional improvement. The dependency features are expected to further improve the performance, although they are not included here in order to provide a relatively fair comparison."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have shown that the characters in a word are informative of the POS type of the entire word in Mandarin, reflecting the fact that the individual Chinese characters carry POS information to some degree. The syntactic relationship among characters may provide further information, which we leave as future work. We have also shown that the additional right-to-left estimation of word emission probabilities is useful for HMM tagging of Mandarin. This suggests that explicit modeling of bi-directional interactions captures more sequential information. This could possibly help in other sequential modeling tasks.","We have also investigated using the reranking algorithm in (Collins and Koo, 2005) for the Mandarin POS tagging task, and found it quite effective","8","Tseng at el.’s training/test split uses up the entire CTB corpus, leaving no development data for tuning parameters. In order to roughly measure reranking performance, we use the update-once method to train the reranking model for 600,000 rounds with the other parameters tuned in Section 4. This sacrifices performance to some extent. in improving tagging accuracy. The original algorithm has a tendency to focus on a small subset of strong features and ignore some of the other useful features. We were able to improve the performance of the reranking algorithm by utilizing two different methods that make better use of more features. Both are simple and yet effective. The effectiveness of dependency features suggests that syntax-based long distance features are important for improving part-of-speech tagging performance in Mandarin. Although parsing is computationally more demanding than tagging, we hope to identify related features that can be extracted more efficiently.","In future efforts, we plan to extract additional reranking features utilizing more explicitly the characteristics of Mandarin. We also plan to extend our work to speech transcripts for Broadcast News and Broadcast Conversation corpora, and explore semisupervised training methods for reranking."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0023.
