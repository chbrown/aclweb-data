As a result, often no substructures corresponding to partial PTB constituents are extracted to form translation rules.","Syntax translation models acquired by composing treebank grammar rules assume that long rewrites are not decomposable into smaller steps. This effectively restricts the generalization power of the in-duced model. For example, suppose we have an xRs (Knight and Graehl, 2004) rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates the Chinese phrase RUSSIA MINISTER VIKTOR-CHERNOMYRDIN into an English NPB tree fragment yielding an English phrase. Also suppose that we want to translate a Chinese phrase","VIKTOR-CHERNOMYRDIN AND HIS COLLEAGUE into English. What we desire is that if we have another rule R2 as shown in Figure 1, we could somehow compose it with R1 to obtain the desirable translation. We unfortunately cannot do this because R1 and R2 are not further decomposable and their substructures cannot be re-used. The requirement that all translation rules have exactly one root node does not enable us to use the translation of VIKTOR-CHERNOMYRDIN in any other contexts than those seen in the training corpus.","A solution to overcome this problem is to right-binarize the left-hand side (LHS) (or the English-side) tree of R1 such that we can decompose R1 into R3 and R4 by factoring NNP(viktor) NNP(chernomyrdin) out as R4 according to the word alignments; and left-binarize the LHS of R2 by introducing a new tree node that collapses the two NNP’s, so as to generalize this rule, getting rule R5 and rule R6. We also need to consistently syntactify the root labels of R4 and the new frontier label of R6 such that these two rules can be composed. Since labeling is not a concern of this paper, we simply label new nodes with X-bar where X here is the parent label. With all these in place, we now can translate the foreign sentence by composing R6 and R4 in Figure 1.","Binarizing the syntax trees for syntax-based machine translation is similar in spirit to generalizing parsing models via markovization (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000). But in translation modeling, it is unclear how to effectively markovize the translation rules, especially when the rules are complex like those proposed by Galley et al. (2006).","In this paper, we explore the generalization ability of simple binarization methods like left-, right-, and head-binarization, and also their combinations.

We then introduce a parallel restructuring method, that is, one can binarize both to the left and right at the same time, resulting in a binarization forest. We employ the EM (Dempster et al., 1977) algorithm to learn the binarization bias for each tree node from the parallel alternatives. The EM-binarization yields best translation performance.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related research.

Grammar binarization usually maintains an equivalence to the original grammar such that binarized grammars generate the same language and assign the same probability to each string as the original grammar does. Grammar binarization is often employed to make the grammar fitin a CKY parser. In our work, we are focused on binarization of parse trees. Tree binarization generalizes the resulting grammar and changes its probability distribution. In tree binarization, synchronous grammars built from restructured (binarized) training trees still contain non-binary, multi-level rules and thus still require the binarization transformation so as to be employed by a CKY parser.","The translation model we are using in this paper belongs to the xRs formalism (Knight and Graehl, 2004), which has been proved successful for machine translation in (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"3 Concepts","paragraphs":["We focus on tree-to-string (in noisy-channel model sense) translation models. Translation models of this type are typically trained on tuples of a source-language sentence f, a target language (e.g., English) parse tree π that yields e and translates from f, and the word alignments a between e and f. Such a tuple is called an alignment graph in (Galley et al., 2004).

An xRs rule can be extracted only from an admissible tree node, so that we do not have to deal with dis-contiguous f spans in decoding (or synchronous parsing). For example, in tree (2) in Figure 2, node NPB is not admissible because the f string that the node covers also aligns to NNP4, which is not covered by the NPB. Node NPB in tree (3), on the other hand, is admissible.","A set of sibling tree nodes is called factorizable if we can form an admissible new node dominating them. For example, in tree (1) of Figure 2, sibling nodes NNP2 NNP3 and NNP4 are factorizable because we can factorize them out and form a new node NPB, resulting in tree (3). Sibling tree nodes NNP1 NNP2 and NNP3 are not factorizable. In synchronous parse trees, not all sibling nodes are factorizable, thus not all sub-phrases can be acquired and syntactified. The main purpose of our paper is to restructure parse trees by factorization such that syntactifiedsub-phrases can be employed in translation."]},{"title":"4 Binarizing Syntax Trees","paragraphs":["We are going to binarize a tree node n that dominates r children n1, ..., nr. Restructuring will be performed by introducing new tree nodes to dominate a subset of the children nodes. To avoid over-generalization, we allow ourselves to form only one new node at a time. For example, in Figure 2, we can binarize tree (1) into tree (2), but we are not allowed to form two new nodes, one dominating NNP1 NNP2 and the other dominating NNP3 NNP4. Since labeling is not the concern of this paper, we re-label the newly formed nodes as n. 4.1 Simple binarization methods","The left binarization of node n (i.e., the NPB in tree (1) of Figure 2) factorizes the leftmost r 1 children by forming a new node n (i.e., NPB in tree (2)) to dominate them, leaving the last child nr untouched; and then makes the new node n the left child of n. The method then recursively left-binarizes the newly formed node n until two leaves are reached. In Figure 2, we left-binarize tree (1) into (2) and then into (4).","The right binarization of node n factorizes the rightmost r 1 children by forming a new node n (i.e., NPB in tree (3)) to dominate them, leaving the 748 first child n1 untouched; and then makes the new node n the right child of n. The method then recursively right-binarizes the newly formed node n. In Figure 2, we right-binarize tree (1) into (3) and then into (7).","The head binarization of node n left-binarizes n if the head is the first child; otherwise, right-binarizes n. We prefer right-binarization to left-binarization when both are applicable under the head restriction because our initial motivation was to generalize the NPB-rooted translation rules. As we will show in the experiments, binarization of other types of phrases contribute to the translation accuracy improvement as well.","Any of these simple binarization methods is easy to implement, but is incapable of giving us all the factorizable sub-phrases. Binarizing all the way to the left, for example, from tree (1) to tree (2) and to tree (4) in Figure 2, does not enable us to acquire a substructure that yields NNP3 NNP4 and their translational equivalences. To obtain more factorizable sub-phrases, we need to parallel-binarize in both directions. 4.2 Parallel binarization Simple binarizations transform a parse tree into another single parse tree. Parallel binarization will transform a parse tree into a binarization forest, desirably packed to enable dynamic programming when extracting translation rules from it.","Borrowing terms from parsing semirings (Goodman, 1999), a packed forest is composed of additive forest nodes ( -nodes) and multiplicative forest nodes ( -nodes). In the binarization forest, a - node corresponds to a tree node in the unbinarized tree; and this -node composes several -nodes, forming a one-level substructure that is observed in the unbinarized tree. A -node corresponds to alternative ways of binarizing the same tree node in the unbinarized tree and it contains one or more - nodes. The same -node can appear in more than one place in the packed forest, enabling sharing. Figure 3 shows a packed forest obtained by packing trees (4) and (7) in Figure 2 via the following parallel binarization algorithm.","To parallel-binarize a tree node n that has children n1, ..., nr, we employ the following steps: ⊕ 1 (NPB) ⊗ 2 (NPB) ⊕ 3 (NPB) ⊗ 4 (NPB) ⊕ 5 (NPB) ⊗ 6 (NPB)","⊕","7","(NNP 1 ) ⊕","8","(NNP","2",") ⊕ 9 (NNP","3",")","⊕ 10 (NNP","4",") ⊗ 11 (NPB)","⊕","7","(NNP 1 ) ⊕","12","(NPB) ⊗ 13 (NPB)","⊕","8","(NNP 2 ) ⊕","14","(NPB) ⊗ 15 (NPB)","⊕","9","(NNP 3 ) ⊕","10","(NNP","4",") Figure 3: Packed forest obtained by packing trees (4) and (7) in Figure 2","We recursively parallel-binarize children nodes n1, ..., nr, producing binarization -nodes (n1), ..., (nr), respectively.","We right-binarize n, if any contiguous1","subset of children n2, ..., nr is factorizable, by introducing an intermediate tree node labeled as n. We recursively parallel-binarize n to generate a binarization forest node (n). We form a multiplicative forest node R as the parent of (n1) and (n).","We left-binarize n if any contiguous subset of n1, ..., nr−1 is factorizable and if this subset contains n1. Similar to the above right-binarization, we introduce an intermediate tree node labeled as n, recursively parallel-binarize n to generate a binarization forest node (n), form a multiplicative forest node L as the parent of (n) and (n1).","We form an additive node (n) as the parent of the two already formed multiplicative nodes L and R.","The (left and right) binarization conditions consider any subset to enable the factorization of small constituents. For example, in tree (1) of Figure 2, although NNP1 NNP2 NNP3 of NPB are not factorizable, the subset NNP1 NNP2 is factorizable. The binarization from tree (1) to tree (2) serves as a relaying step for us to factorize NNP1 NNP2 in tree (4). The left-binarization condition is stricter than","1","We factorize only subsets that cover contiguous spans to avoid introducing dis-contiguous constituents for practical purpose. In principle, the algorithm works fine without this binarization condition. 749 the right-binarization condition to avoid spurious binarization; i.e., to avoid the same subconstituent be-ing reached via both binarizations. We could transform tree (1) directly into tree (4) without bother-ing to generate tree (3). However, skipping tree (3) will create us difficulty in applying the EM algorithm to choose a better binarization for each tree node, since tree (4) can neither be classified as left binarization nor as right binarization of the original tree (1) — it is the result of the composition of two left-binarizations.","In parallel binarization, nodes are not always binarizable in both directions. For example, we do not need to right-binarize tree (2) because NNP2 NNP3 are not factorizable, and thus cannot be used to form sub-phrases. It is still possible to right-binarize tree (2) without affecting the correctness of the parallel binarization algorithm, but that will spuriously increase the branching factor of the search for the rule extraction, because we will have to expand more tree nodes.","A restricted version of parallel binarization is the headed parallel binarization, where both the left and the right binarization must respect the head propaga-tion property at the same time.","A nice property of parallel binarization is that for any factorizable substructure in the unbinarized tree, we can always find a corresponding admissible -node in the parallel-binarized packed forest. A leftmost substructure like the lowest NPB-subtree in tree (4) of Figure 2 can be made factorizable by several successive left binarizations, resulting in 5(NPB)-node in the packed forest in Figure 3. A substructure in the middle can be factorized by the composition of several left- and right-binarizations. Therefore, after a tree is parallel-binarized, to make the sub-phrases available to the MT system, all we need to do is to extract rules from the admissible nodes in the packed forest. Rules that can be extracted from the original unrestructured tree can be extracted from the packed forest as well.","Parallel binarization results in parse forests. Thus translation rules need to be extracted from training data consisting of (e-forest, f, a)-tuples."]},{"title":"5 Extracting translation rules from (e-forest, f, a)-tuples","paragraphs":["The algorithm to extract rules from (e-forest, f, a)- tuples is a natural generalization of the (e-parse, f, a)-based rule extraction algorithm in (Galley et al., 2006). The input to the forest-based algorithm is a (e-forest, f, a)-triple. The output of the algorithm is a derivation forest (Galley et al., 2006) composed of xRs rules. The algorithm recursively traverses the e-forest top-down and extracts rules only at admissible forest nodes.","The following procedure transforms the packed e-forest in Figure 3 into a packed synchronous derivation in Figure 4. Condition 1: Suppose we reach an additive e-forest node, e.g. 1(NPB) in Figure 3. For each of 1(NPB)’s children, e-forest nodes 2(NPB) and 11(NPB), we go to condition 2 to recursively extract rules on these two e-forest nodes, generating multiplicative derivation forest nodes, i.e., (NPB(NPB : x0 NNP3(viktor) NNP4(chernomyrdin)4) ! x0 V-C) and (NPB(NNP1 NPB(NNP2 : x0 NPB : x1)) ! x0 x1 x2) in Figure 4.

From a 50M-word Chinese-to-English parallel corpus, we can extract more than 300 million translation rules, while the tree-based rule extraction algorithm gives approximately 100 million. However, the restructured trees from the simple binarization methods are not guaranteed to give the best trees for syntax-based machine translation. What we desire is a binarization method that still produces single parse trees, but is able to mix left binarization and right binarization in the same tree.

The motivation is that binarization deepens the parses and increases the number of tree nodes. In (Galley et al., 2006), a composed rule is extracted only if the number of internal nodes it contains does not exceed a limit (i.e., 4), similar to the phrase length limit in phrase-based systems. This means that rules extracted from the restructured trees will be smaller than those from the unrestructured trees, if the X nodes are deleted. As shown in (Galley et al., 2006), smaller rules lose context, and thus give lower translation performance. Ignoring X nodes when computing the rule sizes preserves the unstructured rules in the resulting translation model and adds substructures as bonuses. 7.2 Experiment results Table 1 shows the BLEU scores of mixed-cased and detokenized translations of different systems. We see that all the binarization methods improve the baseline system that does not apply any binarization algorithm. The EM-binarization performs the best among all the restructuring methods, leading to 1.0 BLEU point improvement. We also computed the bootstrap p-values (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005) for the pairwise BLEU comparison between the baseline system and any of the system trained from binarized trees. The significance test shows that the EM binarization result is statistically significant better than the baseline system (p > 0.005), even though the baseline is already quite strong.
