The questions involved range from reconstruction of ancient word forms, to the elucidation of phonological drift processes, to the determination of phylogenetic relationships between languages. However, this problem has received relatively little attention from the computational community. What work there is has focused on the reconstruction of phylogenies on the basis of a Boolean matrix indicating the properties of words in different languages (Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Evans et al., 2004; Ringe et al., 2002; Nakhleh et al., 2005).","In this paper, we present a novel framework, along with a concrete model and experiments, for the probabilistic modeling of diachronic phonology. We focus on the case where the words are etymological cognates across languages, e.g. French faire and Spanish hacer from Latin facere (to do). Given this information as input, we learn a model acting at the level of individual phoneme sequences, which can be used for reconstruction and prediction, Our model is fully generative, and can be used to reason about a variety of types of information. For example, we can observe a word in one or more modern languages, say French and Spanish, and query the corresponding word form in another language, say Italian. This kind of lexicon-filling has applications in machine translation. Alternatively, we can also reconstruct ancestral word forms or inspect the rules learned along each branch of a phylogeny to identify salient patterns. Finally, the model can be used as a building block in a system for inferring the topology of phylogenetic trees. We discuss all of these cases further in Section 4.","The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the approach to modeling language change at the phoneme sequence level is new, as is the specific model we present. Second, we compiled a new corpus1","and developed a methodology for quantitatively evaluating such approaches. Finally, we describe an efficient inference algorithm for our model and empirically study its performance. 1.1 Previous work While our word-level model of phonological change is new, there have been several computational investigations into diachronic linguistics which are relevant to the present work.","The task of reconstructing phylogenetic trees","1","nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/pages/historical.html 887 for languages has been studied by several authors. These approaches descend from glottochronology (Swadesh, 1955), which views a language as a collection of shared cognates but ignores the structure of those cognates. This information is obtained from manually curated cognate lists such as the data of Dyen et al. (1997).","As an example of a cognate set encoding, consider the meaning “eat”. There would be one column for the cognate set which appears in French as manger and Italian as mangiare since both descend from the Latin mandere (to chew). There would be another column for the cognate set which appears in both Spanish and Portuguese as comer, descending from the Latin comedere (to consume). If this were the only data, algorithms based on this data would tend to conclude that French and Italian were closely related and that Spanish and Portuguese were equally related. However, the cognate set representation has several disadvantages: it does not capture the fact that the cognate is closer between Spanish and Portuguese than between French and Spanish, nor do the resulting models let us conclude anything about the regular processes which caused these languages to diverge. Also, the existing cognate data has been curated at a relatively high cost. In our work, we track each word using an automatically obtained cognate list. While our cognates may be noisier, we compensate by modeling phonological changes rather than boolean mutations in cognate sets.","There has been other computational work in this broad domain. Venkataraman et al. (1997) describe an information theoretic measure of the distance between two dialects of Chinese. Like our approach, they use a probabilistic edit model as a formaliza-tion of the phonological process. However, they do not consider the question of reconstruction or inference in multi-node phylogenies, nor do they present a learning algorithm for such models.","Finally, for the specific application of cognate prediction in machine translation, essentially transliteration, there have been several approaches, including Kondrak (2002). However, the phenomena of interest, and therefore the models, are extremely different. Kondrak (2002) presents a model for learning “sound laws,” general phonological changes governing two completely observed aligned cognate lists. His model can be viewed as a special la es it la vl ib es pt it la it pt es la it es pt Topology 1 Topology 2 *Topology 3 *Topology 4 Figure 1: Tree topologies used in our experiments. *Topology 3 and *Topology 4 are incorrect evolutionary tree used for our experiments on the selection of phylogenies (Section 4.4). case of ours using a simple two-node topology.","There is also a rich literature (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) on the related problems of evolutionary biology. A good reference on the subject is Felsenstein (2003). In particular, Yang and Rannala (1997), Mau and Newton (1997) and Li et al. (2000) each independently presented a Bayesian model for computing posteriors over evolutionary trees. A key difference with our model is that independence across evolutionary sites is assumed in their work, while the evolution of the phonemes in our model depends on the environment in which the change occurs."]},{"title":"2 A model of phonological change","paragraphs":["Assume we have a fixed set of word types (cognate sets) in our vocabulary V and a set of languages L. Each word type i has a word form wil in each language l ∈ L, which is represented as a sequence of phonemes and might or might not be observed. The languages are arranged according to some tree topology T (see Figure 1 for examples). One might consider models that simultaneously induce the topology and cognate set assignments, but let us fix both for now. We discuss one way to relax this assump-tion and present experimental results in Section 4.4.","Our generative model (Figure 3) specifies a distribution over the word forms {wil} for each word type i ∈ V and each language l ∈ L. The generative process starts at the root language and generates all the word forms in each language in a top-down manner. One appealing aspect about our model is that, at a high-level, it reflects the actual phonological process that languages undergo. However, important phenomena like lexical drift, borrowing, and other non-phonological changes are not modeled. 888","Our generative model can be summarized as follows: For each word i ∈ V : −wiROOT ∼ LanguageModel For each branch (k → l) ∈ T : −θk→l ∼ Dirichlet(α) [choose edit params.] −For each word i ∈ V : −−wil ∼ Edit(wik, θk→l) [sample word form]","In the remainder of this section, we describe each of the steps in the model. 2.1 Language model For the distribution w ∼ LanguageModel, we used a simple bigram phoneme model. The phonemes were partitioned into natural classes (see Section 4 for details). A root word form consisting of n phonemes x1 · · · xn is generated with probability plm(x1) n ∏ j=2 plm(xj | NaturalClass(xj−1)), where plm is the distribution of the language model. 2.2 Edit model The stochastic edit model y ∼ Edit(x, θ) describes how a single old word form x = x1 · · · xn changes along one branch of the phylogeny with parameters θ to produce a new word form y. This process is parameterized by rule probabilities θk→l, which are specific to branch (k → l).","The generative process is as follows: for each phoneme xi in the old word form, walking from left to right, choose a rule to apply. There are three types of rules: (1) deletion of the phoneme, (2) substitution with another phoneme (possibly the same one), or (3) insertion of another phoneme, either before or after the existing one. The probability of applying a rule depends on a context (NaturalClass(xi−1), NaturalClass(xi+1)). Figure 2 illustrates the edits on an example. The context-dependence allows us to represent phenomena such as the fact that s is likely to be deleted only in word-final contexts.","The edit model we have presented approximately encodes a limited form of classic rewrite-driven segmental phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968). One # C V C V C # # f o k u s # # f w O k o # # C V V C V # f → f / # V o → w O / C C k → k / V V u → o / C C s → / V # Edits applied Rules used Figure 2: An example of edits that were used to transform the Latin word FOCUS (/fokus/) into the Italian word fuoco (/fwOko/) (fire) along with the context-specific rules that were applied. could imagine basing our model on more modern phonological theory, but the computational properties of the edit model are compelling, and it is adequate for many kinds of phonological change.","In addition to simple edits, we can model some classical changes that appear to be too complex to be captured by a single left-to-right edit model of this kind. For instance, bleeding and feeding arrange-ments occur when one phonological change introduces a new context, which triggers another phonological change, but the two cannot occur simultaneously. For example, vowel raising e → i / c might be needed before palatalization t → c / i. Instead of capturing such an interaction directly, we can break up a branch into two segments joined at an intermediate language node, conflating the concept of historically intermediate languages with the concept of intermediate stages in the application of sequential rules.","However, many complex processes are not well-represented by our basic model. One problematic case is chained shifts such as Grimm’s law in Proto-Germanic or the Great Vowel Shift in English. To model such dependent rules, we would need to use a more complex prior distributions over the edit parameters. Another difficult case is prosodic changes, such as unstressed vowel neutralizations, which would require a representation of suprasegmental features. While our basic model does not account for these phenomena, extensions within the generative framework could capture such richness."]},{"title":"3 Learning and inference","paragraphs":["We use a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to fit the parameters of our model.

The plate notation indicates the replication of the nodes corresponding to the evolving words. structions based on the current edit parameters, and an M-step, which updates the edit parameters based on the reconstructions. 3.1 Monte Carlo E-step: sampling the edits The E-step needs to produce expected counts of how many times each edit (such as o → O) was used in each context. An exact E-step would require sum-ming over all possible edits involving all languages in the phylogeny (all unobserved {e}, {w} variables in Figure 3). Unfortunately, unlike in the case of HMMs and PCFGs, our model permits no tractable dynamic program to compute these counts exactly.","Therefore, we resort to a Monte Carlo E-step, where many samples of the edit variables are collected, and counts are computed based on these samples. Samples are drawn using Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984): for each word form of a particular language wil, we fix all other variables in the model and sample wil along with its corresponding edits.","In the E-step, we fix the parameters, which renders the word types conditionally independent, just as in an HMM. Therefore, we can process each word type in turn without approximation.","First consider the simple 4-language topology in Figure 3. Suppose that the words in languages A, C and D are fixed, and we wish to infer the word at language B along with the three corresponding sets of edits (remember the edits fully determine the words). There are an exponential number of possible words/edits, but it turns out that we can exploit the Markov structure in the edit model to consider all such words/edits using dynamic programming, in a way broadly similar to the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs.","Figure 4 shows the lattice for the dynamic program. Each path connecting the two shaded endpoint states represents a particular word form for language B and a corresponding set of edits. Each node in the lattice is a state of the dynamic program, which is a 5-tuple (iA, iC , iD, c1, c2), where iA, iC and iD are the cursor positions (represented by dots in Figure 4) in each of the word forms of A, C and D, respectively; c1 is the natural class of the phoneme in the word form for B that was last generated; and c2 corresponds to the phoneme that will be generated next.","Each state transition involves applying a rule to A’s current phoneme (which produces 0–2 phonemes in B) and applying rules to B’s new 0–2 phonemes. There are three types of rules (deletion, substitution, insertion), resulting in 30","+32","+34","= 91 types of state transitions. For illustration, Figure 4 shows the simpler case where B only has one child C. Given these rules, the new state is computed by advancing the appropriate cursors and updating the natural classes c1 and c2. The weight of each transition w(s → t) is a product of the language model probability and the rule probabilities that were chosen.","For each state s, the dynamic program computes W (s), the sum of the weights of all paths leaving s, W (s) = ∑ s→t w(s → t)W (t). To sample a path, we start at the leftmost state, choose the transition with probability proportional to its contribution in the sum for computing W (s), and repeat until we reach the rightmost state.","We applied a few approximations to speed up the sampling of words, which reduced the running time by several orders of magnitude.

For each branch (k → l) ∈ T in the phylogeny, we compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the edit parameters {θk→l(x → β / c1 c2)}. For example, the parameter corresponding to x = /e/, β = /e s/, c1 = ALVEOLAR, c2 = # is the probability of inserting a final /s/ after an /e/ which is itself preceded by an alveolar phoneme. The probability of each rule is estimated as follows:","θk→l(x → β / c1 c2) = #(x → β / c1 c2) + α(x → β / c1 c2) − 1","∑ β′ #(x → β′","/ c1 c2) + α(x → β′","/ c1 c2) − 1, where α is the concentration hyperparameter of the Dirichlet prior. The value α − 1 can be interpreted as the number of pseudocounts for a rule."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section we show the results of our experiments with our model.

We start with a description of the corpus we created for these experiments. 4.1 Corpus In order to train and evaluate our system, we compiled a corpus of Romance cognate words. The raw data was taken from three sources: the wiktionary.org website, a Bible parallel corpus (Resnik et al., 1999) and the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2002). From an XML dump of the Wiktionary data, we extracted multilingual translations, which provide a list of word tuples in a large number of languages, including a few ancient languages. 891 The Europarl and the biblical data were processed and aligned in the standard way, using combined GIZA++ alignments (Och and Ney, 2003).","We performed our experiments with four languages from the Romance family (Latin, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). For each of these languages, we used a simple in-house rule-based system to convert the words into their IPA representations.2","After augmenting our alignments with the transitive closure3","of the Europarl, Bible and Wiktionary data, we filtered out non-cognate words by thresholding the ratio of edit distance to word length.4","The preprocessing is constraining in that we require that all the elements of a tuple to be cognates, which leaves out a significant portion of the data be-hind (see the row Full entries in Table 2). However, our approach relies on this assumption, as there is no explicit model of non-cognate words. An interesting direction for future work is the joint modeling of phonology with the determination of the cognates, but our simpler setting lets us focus on the properties of the edit model. Moreover, the restriction to full entries has the side advantage that the Latin bottleneck prevents the introduction of too many neologisms, which are numerous in the Europarl data, to the final corpus.","Since we used automatic tools for preparing our corpus rather than careful linguistic analysis, our cognate list is much noiser in terms of the presence of borrowed words and phonemeic transcrip-tion errors compared to the ones used by previous approaches (Swadesh, 1955; Dyen et al., 1997). The benefit of our mechanical preprocessing is that more cognate data can easily be made available, allowing us to effectively train richer models. We show in the rest of this section that our phonological model can indeed overcome this noise and recover meaningful patterns from the data. 2 The tool and the rules we used are available at","nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/pages/historical.html. 3 For example, we would infer from an la-es bible align-","ment confessionem-confesión (confession) and an es-it Eu-","roparl alignment confesión-confessione that the Latin word con-","fessionem and the Italian word confessione are related. 4 To be more precise we keep a tuple (w1, w2, . . . , wp) iff","d(w i,w","j)","̄","l(w i,w","j) ≤ 0.7 for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p}, where l̄ is the mean length","|w i|+|w","j| 2 and d is the Levenshtein distance.

The language column corresponds to the language held-out for evaluation. We show the mean edit distance across the evaluation examples. 4.2 Reconstruction of word forms We ran the system using Topology 1 in Figure 1 to demonstrate the the system can propose reasonable reconstructions of Latin word forms on the basis of modern observations. Half of the Latin words at the root of the tree were held out, and the (uniform cost) Levenshtein edit distance from the predicted reconstruction to the truth was computed. Our baseline is to pick randomly, for each heldout node in the tree, an observed neighboring word (i.e. copy one of the modern forms). We stopped EM after 15 iterations, and reported the result on a Viterbi derivation using the parameters obtained. Our model outperformed this baseline by a 9% relative reduction in average edit distance. Similarly, reconstruction of modern forms was also demonstrated, with an improvement of 11% (see Table 3).","To give a qualitative feel for the operation of the system (good and bad), consider the example in Figure 5, taken from this experiment. The Latin dentis /dEntis/ (teeth) is nearly correctly reconstructed as /dEntes/, reconciling the appearance of the /j/ in the 892"]},{"title":"/dEntis/ /djEntes/ /dEnti/","paragraphs":["i → E E → j E s → Figure 5: An example of a Latin reconstruction given the Spanish and Italian word forms. Spanish and the disappearance of the final /s/ in the Italian. Note that the /is/ vs. /es/ ending is difficult to predict in this context (indeed, it was one of the early distinctions to be eroded in vulgar Latin).","While the uniform-cost edit distance misses important aspects of phonology (all phoneme substitutions are not equal, for instance), it is parameter-free and still seems to correlate to a large extent with linguistic quality of reconstruction. It is also superior to held-out log-likelihood, which fails to penalize errors in the modeling assumptions, and to measuring the percentage of perfect reconstructions, which ignores the degree of correctness of each reconstructed word. 4.3 Inference of phonological changes Another use of our model is to automatically recover the phonological drift processes between known or partially known languages. To facilitate evaluation, we continued in the well-studied Romance evolutionary tree. Again, the root is Latin, but we now add an additional modern language, Portuguese, and two additional hidden nodes. One of the nodes characterizes the least common ancestor of modern Spanish and Portuguese; the other, the least common ancestor of all three modern languages. In Figure 1, Topology 2, these two nodes are labelled vl (Vulgar Latin) and ib (Proto-Ibero Romance) respectively. Since we are omitting many other branches, these names should not be understood as referring to actual historical proto-languages, but, at best, to collapsed points representing several centuries of evolution. Nonetheless, the major reconstructed rules still correspond to well known phenomena and the learned model generally places them on reasonable branches.","Figure 6 shows the top four general rules for each of the evolutionary branches in this experiment, ranked by the number of times they were used in the derivations during the last iteration of EM. The la, es, pt, and it forms are fully observed while the vl and ib forms are automatically reconstructed. Figure 6 also shows a specific example of the evolution of the Latin VERBUM (word/verb), along with the specific edits employed by the model.","While quantitative evaluation such as measuring edit distance is helpful for comparing results, it is also illuminating to consider the plausibility of the learned parameters in a historical light, which we do here briefly. In particular, we consider rules on the branch between la and vl, for which we have historical evidence. For example, documents such as the Appendix Probi (Baehrens, 1922) provide in-dications of orthographic confusions which resulted from the growing gap between Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin phonology around the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The Appendix lists common misspellings of Latin words, from which phonological changes can be inferred.","On the la to vl branch, rules for word-final deletion of classical case markers dominate the list (rules ranks 1 and 3 for deletion of final /s/, ranks 2 and 4 for deletion of final /m/). It is indeed likely that these were generally eliminated in Vulgar Latin. For the deletion of the /m/, the Appendix Probi contains pairs such as PASSIM NON PASSI and OLIM NON OLI. For the deletion of final /s/, this was observed in early inscriptions, e.g. CORNELIO for CORNE-LIOS (Allen, 1989). The frequent leveling of the distinction between /o/ and /u/ (rules ranked 5 and 6) can be also be found in the Appendix Probi: COLU-BER NON COLOBER. Note that in the specific example shown, the model lowers the orignal /u/ and then re-raises it in the pt branch due to a latter process along that branch.","Similarily, major canonical rules were discovered in other branches as well, for example, /v/ to /b/ fortition in Spanish, /s/ to /z/ voicing in Italian, palatalization along several branches, and so on. Of course, the recovered words and rules are not perfect. For example, reconstructed Ibero /tRinta/ to Spanish /tReinta/ (thirty) is generated in an odd fashion using rules /e/ to /i/ and /n/ to /in/.

The Latin root and modern leaves were observed while the hidden nodes as well as all the derivations were obtained using the parameters computed by our model after 15 iterations of EM. Nontrivial rules (i.e. rules that are not identities) used at each stage are shown along the corresponding edge. The boxes display the top four nontrivial rules corresponding to each of these evolutionary branches, ordered by the number of time they were applied during the last E round of sampling. Note that since our natural classes are of fixed granularity, some rules must be redundantly discovered, which tends to flood the top of the rule lists with duplicates of the top few rules. We summarized such redundancies in the above tables. from being captured, resulting in either rules applying with low probability in overly coarse environments or rules being learned redundantly in overly fine environments. 4.4 Selection of phylogenies In this experiment, we show that our model can be used to select between various topologies of phylogenies. We first presented to the algorithm the universally accepted evolutionary tree corresponding to the evolution of Latin into Spanish, Portuguese and Italian (Topology 2 in Figure 1). We estimated the log-likelihood L∗","of the data under this topology. Next, we estimated the log-likelihood L′","under two defective topologies (*Topology 3 and *Topology 4). We recorded the log-likelihood ratio L∗","− L′ after the last iteration of EM. Note that the two like-lihoods are comparable since the complexity of the two models is the same.5","We obtained a ratio of L∗","− L′","= −4458 − (−4766) = 307 for Topology 2 versus *Topology 3, and −4877 − (−5125) = 248 for Topology 2 versus *Topology 4 (the experimental setup is described in Table 1). As one would hope, this log-likelihood ratio is positive in both cases, indicating that the system prefers the true topology over the wrong ones.","While it may seem, at the first glance, that this result is limited in scope, knowing the relative arrange-5 If a word was not reachable in one of the topology, it was","ignored in both models for the computation of the likelihoods. ment of all groups of four nodes is actually sufficient for constructing a full-fledged phylogenetic tree. In-deed, quartet-based methods, which have been very popular in the computational biology community, are precisely based on this fact (Erdos et al., 1996). There is a rich literature on this subject and approximate algorithms exist which are robust to misclassification of a subset of quartets (Wu et al., 2007). 4.5 More experimental details This section summarizes the values of the parameters we used in these experiments, their interpreta-tion, and the effect of setting them to other values.","The Dirichlet prior on the parameters can be interpreted as adding pseudocounts to the corresponding edits. It is an important way of infusing parsimony into the model by setting the prior of the self-substitution parameters much higher than that of the other parameters. We used 6.0 as the prior on the self-substitution parameters, and for all environments, 1.1 was divided uniformly across the other edits. As long as the prior on self-substitution is kept within this rough order of magnitude, varying them has a limited effect on our results. We also initialized the parameters with values that encourage self-substitutions. Again, the results were robust to perturbation of initialization as long as the value for self-substitution dominates the other parameters.","The experiments used two natural classes for vowels (rounded and unrounded), and six natural 894 classes for consonants, based on the place of articulation (alveolar, bilabial, labiodental, palatal, postalveolar, and velar). We conducted experiments to evaluate the effect of using different natural classes and found that finer ones can help if enough data is used for training. We defer the meticulous study of the optimal granularity to future work, as it would be a more interesting experiment under a loglinear model. In such a model, contexts of different granularities can coexist, whereas such coexistence is not recognized by the current model, giving rise to many duplicate rules.","We estimated the bigram phoneme model on the words in the root languages that were not heldout. Just as in machine translation, the language model was found to contribute significantly to reconstruction performance. We tried to increase the weight of the language model by exponentiating it to a power, as is often done in NLP applications, but we did not find that it had any significant impact on performance.","In the reconstruction experiments, when the data was not reachable by the model, the word used in the initialization was used as the prediction, and the evolution of these words were ignored when reestimating the parameters. Words were initialized by picking at random, for each unobserved node, an observed node’s corresponding word."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a novel probabilistic model of diachronic phonology and an associated inference procedure. Our experiments indicate that our model is able to both produce accurate reconstructions as measured by edit distance and identify linguistically plausible rules that account for the phonological changes. We believe that the probabilistic framework we have introduced for diachronic phonology is promising, and scaling it up to richer phylogenetic may indeed reveal something insightful about language change."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Bonnie Chantarotwong for her help with the IPA converter and our reviewers for their comments.
