When we consider the nature of these sequence labeling tasks, a semi-supervised approach appears to be more natural and appropriate. This is because the number of features and parameters typically become extremely large, and labeled examples can only sparsely cover the parameter space, even if thousands of labeled examples are available. In fact, many attempts have recently been made to develop semi-supervised SOL methods (Zhu et al., 2003; Li and McCallum, 2005; Altun et al., 2005; Jiao et al., 2006; Brefeld and Scheffer, 2006).","With the generative approach, we can easily incorporate unlabeled data into probabilistic models with the help of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms (Dempster et al., 1977). For example, the Baum-Welch algorithm is a well-known algorithm for training a hidden Markov model (HMM) of sequence learning. Generally, with sequence learning tasks such as NER and Chunking, we cannot expect to obtain better performance than that obtained using discriminative approaches in supervised learning settings.","In contrast to the generative approach, with the discriminative approach, it is not obvious how unlabeled training data can be naturally incorporated into a discriminative training criterion. For example, the effect of unlabeled data will be eliminated from the objective function if the unlabeled data is directly used in traditional i.i.d. conditional-probability models. Nevertheless, several attempts have recently been made to incorporate unlabeled data in the discriminative approach. An approach based on pairwise similarities, which encourage nearby data points to have the same class label, has been proposed as a way of incorporating unlabeled data discriminatively (Zhu et al., 2003; Altun et al., 2005; Brefeld and Scheffer, 2006). However, this approach generally requires joint inference over the whole data set for prediction, which is not practical as regards the large data sets used for standard sequence labeling tasks in NLP. Another discriminative approach to semi-supervised SOL involves the incorporation of an entropy regularizer (Grand-791 valet and Bengio, 2004). Semi-supervised conditional random fields (CRFs) based on a minimum entropy regularizer (SS-CRF-MER) have been proposed in (Jiao et al., 2006). With this approach, the parameter is estimated to maximize the likelihood of labeled data and the negative conditional entropy of unlabeled data. Therefore, the structured predictor is trained to separate unlabeled data well under the entropy criterion by parameter estimation.","In contrast to these previous studies, this paper proposes a semi-supervised SOL framework based on a hybrid generative and discriminative approach. A hybrid approach was first proposed in a supervised learning setting (Raina et al., 2003) for text classification. (Fujino et al., 2005) have developed a semi-supervised approach by discriminatively combining a supervised classifier with generative models that incorporate unlabeled data. We extend this framework to the structured output domain, specifically for sequence labeling tasks. Moreover, we reformalize the objective function to allow the incorporation of discriminative models (structured predictors) trained from labeled data, since the original framework only considers the combination of generative classifiers. As a result, our hybrid model can significantly improve on the state-of-the-art performance obtained with supervised SOL methods, such as CRFs, even if a large amount of labeled data is available, as shown in our experiments on CoNLL-2003 NER and CoNLL-2000 Chunking data. In addition, compared with SS-CRF-MER, our hybrid model has several good characteristics including a low calculation cost and a robust optimization in terms of a sensitiveness of hyper-parameters. This is described in detail in Section 5.3."]},{"title":"2 Supervised SOL: CRFs","paragraphs":["This paper focuses solely on sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) and syntactic chunking (Chunking), as SOL problems. Thus, let x=(x1, . . . , xS) ∈ X be an input sequence, and y=(y0, . . . , yS+1) ∈ Y be a particular output sequence, where y0 and yS+1 are special fixed labels that represent the beginning and end of a sequence.","As regards supervised sequence learning, CRFs are recently introduced methods that constitute flexible and powerful models for structured predictors based on undirected graphical models that have been globally conditioned on a set of inputs (Lafferty et al., 2001). Let λ be a parameter vector and f (ys−1, ys, x) be a (local) feature vector obtained from the corresponding position s given x. CRFs define the conditional probability, p(y| x), as being proportional to a product of potential functions on the cliques. That is, p(y| x) on a (linear-chain) CRF can be defined as follows: p(y| x; λ) = 1 Z(x) S+1 ∏ s=1 exp(λ · f (ys−1, ys, x)). Z(x) =","∑ y","∏S+1","s=1 exp(λ · f (ys−1, ys, x)) is a nor-","malization factor over all output values, Y, and is","also known as the partition function. For parameter estimation (training), given labeled","data Dl = { (xk",", yk",")} K","k=1, the Maximum a Posteri-","ori (MAP) parameter estimation, namely maximiz-","ing log p(λ|D l), is now the most widely used CRF","training criterion. Thus, we maximize the following","objective function to obtain optimal λ: LCRF","(λ) = ∑","k [ λ · ∑ s","f s − log Z(xk ) ] + log p(λ), (1) where f s is an abbreviation of f (ys−1, ys, x) and p(λ) is a prior probability distribution of λ. A gradient-based optimization algorithm such as L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) is widely used for maximizing Equation (1). The gradient of Equation (1) can be written as follows:","∇LCRF (λ) = ∑ k","Ep̃(yk ,xk",";λ) [ ∑ s f s ] − ∑ k","Ep(Y| xk ;λ) [ ∑ s f s ] + ∇ log p(λ). Calculating Ep(Y| x,λ) as well as the partition function Z(x) is not always tractable. However, for linear-chain CRFs, a dynamic programming algorithm similar in nature to the forward-backward algorithm in HMMs has already been developed for an efficient calculation (Lafferty et al., 2001).","For prediction, the most probable output, that is, ŷ = arg maxy∈Y p(y| x; λ), can be efficiently obtained by using the Viterbi algorithm."]},{"title":"3 Hybrid Generative and Discriminative Approach to Semi-Supervised SOL","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe our formulation of a hybrid approach to SOL and a parameter estimation method for sequence predictors. We assume 792","that we have a set of labeled and unlabeled data,","D = {D l, Du} , where Dl = { (xn , yn",")} N","n=1 and","Du = { xm","} M","m=1.","Let us assume that we have I-units of discrimina-","tive models, pD","i , and J -units of generative models, pG j . Our hybrid model for a structured predictor is designed by the discriminative combination of several joint probability densities of x and y, p(x, y). That is, the posterior probability of our hybrid model is defined by providing the log-values of p(x, y) as the features of a log-linear model, such that: R(y| x; Λ, Θ, Γ) =","∏","i pD","i (x, y; λi)γ i ∏","j pG","j (x, y; θj)γ","j","∑ y","∏","i pD","i (x, y; λi)γ i ∏","j pG","j (x, y; θj)γ","j =","∏","i pD","i (y| x; λi)γ i ∏","j pG","j (x, y; θj)γ","j","∑ y","∏","i pD","i (y| x; λi)γ i ∏","j pG","j (x, y; θj)γ","j . (2)","Here, Γ = {{ γi} I","i=1, { γj} I+J","j=I+1} represents the","discriminative combination weight of each model","where γi,γj ∈ [0, 1]. Moreover, Λ={ λi} I","i=1 and Θ= { θj} J","j=1 represent model parameters of individual models estimated from labeled and unlabeled data, respectively. Using pD","(x, y) = pD","(y| x)pD","(x), we can derive the third line from the second line, where pD i (x; λi)γi","for all i are canceled out. Thus, our hybrid model is constructed by combining discriminative models, pD","i (y| x; λi), with generative models, pG j (x, y; θj). Hereafter, let us assume that our hybrid model consists of CRFs for discriminative models, pD","i , and HMMs for generative models, pG","j , shown in Equation (2), since this paper focuses solely on sequence modeling. For HMMs, we consider a first order HMM defined in the following equation: p(x, y| θ) = S+1 ∏ s=1","θy s−1,ys θys,xs , where θys−1,ys and θys,xs represent the transition probability between states ys−1 and ys and the symbol emission probability of the s-th position of the corresponding input sequence, respectively, where θyS+1,xS+1 = 1.","It can be seen that the formalization in the log-linear combination of our hybrid model is very similar to that of LOP-CRFs (Smith et al., 2005). In fact, if we only use a combination of discriminative models (CRFs), which is equivalent to γj = 0 for all j, we obtain essentially the same objective function as that of the LOP-CRFs. Thus, our framework can also be seen as an extension of LOP-CRFs that enables us to incorporate unlabeled data. 3.1 Discriminative Combination For estimating the parameter Γ, let us assume that we already have discriminatively trained models on labeled data, pD","i (y| x; λi). We maximize the following objective function for estimating parameter Γ under a fixed Θ: LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) = ∑","n","log R(yn | xn","; Λ, Θ, Γ)+log p(Γ). (3) where p(Γ) is a prior probability distribution of Γ.","The value of Γ providing a global maximum of LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) is guaranteed under an arbitrary fixed value in the Θ domain, since LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) is a concave function of Γ. Thus, we can easily maximize Equation (3) by using a gradient-based optimization algorithm such as (bound constrained) L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989). 3.2 Incorporating Unlabeled Data We cannot directly incorporate unlabeled data for discriminative training such as Equation (3) since the correct outputs y for unlabeled data are unknown. On the other hand, generative approaches can easily deal with unlabeled data as incomplete data (data with missing variable y) by using a mixture model. A well-known way to achieve this incorporation is to maximize the log likelihood of unlabeled data with respect to the marginal distribution of generative models as L(θ) = ∑ m log ∑ y","p(xm , y; θ). In fact, (Nigam et al., 2000) have reported that using unlabeled data with a mixture model can improve the text classification performance.","According to Bayes’ rule, p(y| x; θ) ∝ p(x, y; θ), the discriminant functions of generative classifiers are provided by generative models p(x, y; θ). Therefore, we can regard L(θ) as the logarithm of the sum of discriminant functions for all missing variables y of unlabeled data. Following this view, we can directly incorporate unlabeled data into our hybrid model by maximizing the 793 discriminant functions g of our hybrid model in the same way as for a mixture model as explained above. Thus, we maximize the following objective function for estimating the model parameters Θ for generative models of unlabeled data: G(Θ| Γ) = ∑ m log ∑ y","g(xm , y; Θ) + log p(Θ). (4) where p(Θ) is a prior probability distribution of Θ. Here, the discriminant function g of output y given input x in our hybrid model can be obtained by the numerator on the third line of Equation (2), since the denominator does not affect the determination of y, that is, g(x, y; Θ) = ∏ i","pD","i (y| x; λi)γ","i ∏","j","pG","j (x, y; θj)γ","j",".","Under a fixed Γ, we can estimate the local max-","imum of G(Θ| Γ) around the initialized value of Θ","by an iterative computation such as the EM algo-","rithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Let Θ′′","and Θ′","be","estimates of Θ in the next and current steps, respec-","tively. Using Jensen’s inequality, log a ≤ a − 1,","we obtain a Q-function that satisfies the inequality","G(Θ′′ | Γ)−G(Θ′","| Γ) ≥ Q(Θ′′",", Θ′","; Γ)−Q(Θ′",", Θ′","; Γ),","such that Q(Θ′′",", Θ′","; Γ) = ∑ j γj ∑ m ∑ y","R(y| xm","; Λ, Θ′",", Γ) log pG","j (xm",", y; Θ′′",")","+ log p(Θ′′ ).","(5) Since Q(Θ′",", Θ′","; Γ) is independent of Θ′′",", we can improve the value of G(Θ| Γ) by computing Θ′′","to maximize Q(Θ′′",", Θ′","; Γ). We can obtain a Θ estimate by iteratively performing this update while G(Θ| Γ) is hill climbing.","As shown in Equation (5), R is used for estimating the parameter Θ. The intuitive effect of maximizing Equation (4) is similar to performing ‘softclustering’. That is, unlabeled data is clustered with respect to the R distribution, which also includes information about labeled data, under the constraint of generative model structures. 3.3 Parameter Estimation Procedure According to our definition, the Θ and Γ estimations are mutually dependent. That is, the parameters of the hybrid model, Γ, should be estimated","1.Given training set: Du = { xm } M m=1 and","Dl = {D ′","l = { (xk",", yk",")} K k=1, D′′","l = { (xn",", yn",")} N","n=1}","2.Compute Λ, using D′ l.","3.Initialize Γ(0)",", Θ(0) and t ← 0.","4.Perform the following until | Θ(t+1)","−Θ(t)","|","| Θ(t)","| < ε.","4.1.

Figure 1: Algorithm of learning model parameters used in our hybrid model. using Equation (3) with a fixed Θ, while the parameters of the generative models, Θ, should be estimated using Equation (4) with a fixed Γ. As a solu-tion to our parameter estimation, we search for the Θ and Γ that maximize LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) and G(Θ| Γ) simultaneously. For this search, we compute Θ and Γ by maximizing the objective functions shown in Equations (4) and (3) iteratively and alternately. We summarize the algorithm for estimating these model parameters in Figure 1.","Note that during the Γ estimation (procedure 4.2 in Figure 1), Γ can be over-fitted to the labeled training data if we use the same labeled training data as used for the Λ estimation. There are several possible ways to reduce this over-fit. In this paper, we select one of the simplest; we divide the labeled training data Dl into two distinct sets D′","l and D′′","l . Then, D′","l and D′′","l are individually used for estimating Λ and Γ, respectively. In our experiments, we divide the labeled training data Dl so that 4/5 is used for D′","l","and the remaining 1/5 for D′′ l . 3.4 Efficient Parameter Estimation Algorithm Let NR(x) represent the denominator of Equation (2), that is the normalization factor of R. We can rearrange Equation (2) as follows: R(y| x; Λ, Θ, Γ) =","∏ s","∏ i [ V D i,s","]γ i ∏","j [ V G j,s","]γ j NR(x)","∏ i[Zi(x)]γ","i , (6) where V D","i,s represents the potential function of the s-th position of the sequence in the i-th CRF and V G j,s represents the probability of the s-th position in the j-th HMM, that is, V D","i,s = exp(λi · f s) and V G j,s = θys−1,ysθys,xs, respectively. See the Appendix for the derivation of Equation (6) from Equation (2). 794","To estimate Γ(t+1)",", namely procedure 4.2 in Figure 1, we employ the derivatives with respect to γi and γj shown in Equation (6), which are the parameters of the discriminative and generative models, respectively. Thus, we obtain the following derivatives with respect to γi:","∂LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) ∂γi = ∑ n","log pD","i (yn | xn",") + ∑","n","log ZD i (xn",") − ∑ n","ER(Y| xn ;Λ,Θ,Γ) [ ∑ s","log V D i,s ] . The first and second terms are constant during iterative procedure 4 in our optimization algorithm shown in Figure 1. Thus, we only need to calculate these values once at the beginning of procedure 4. Let αs(y) and βs(y) represent the forward and backward state costs at position s with output y for corresponding input x. Let Vs(y, y′",") represent the products of the total value of the transition cost between s−1 and s with labels y and y′","in the corresponding input sequence, that is, Vs(y, y′",") =∏","i[V D","i,s(y, y′",")]γi ∏","j[V G","j,s(y, y′",")]γj",". The third term, which indicates the expectation of potential functions, can be rewritten in the form of a forward-backward algorithm, that is, ER(Y| x;Λ,Θ,Γ) [ ∑ s","log V D i,s ] =","1 ZR(x) ∑ s ∑ y,y′","αs−1(y)Vs(y, y′ )β","s(y′",") log V D","i,s(y, y′","),","(7) where ZR(x) represents the partition function of our hybrid model, that is, ZR(x)=NR(x)","∏","i[Zi(x)]γi",". Hence, the calculation of derivatives with respect to γi is tractable since we can incorporate the same forward-backward algorithm as that used in a standard CRF.","Then, the derivatives with respect to γj, which are the parameters of generative models, can be written as follows:","∂LHySOL","(Γ| Θ) ∂γj = ∑ n","log pG","j (xn , yn",")− ∑","n","ER(Y| xn ;Λ,Θ,Γ) [ ∑ s","log V G j,s ] . Again, the second term, which indicates the expectation of transition probabilities and symbol emission probabilities, can be rewritten in the form of a forward-backward algorithm in the same manner as","γi, where the only difference is that V D i,s is substituted by V G","j,s in Equation (7).","To estimate Θ(t+1)",", which is procedure 4.1 in Figure 1, the same forward-backward algorithm as used in standard HMMs is available since the form of our Q-function shown in Equation (5) is the same as that of standard HMMs. The only difference is that our method uses marginal probabilities given by R in-stead of the p(x, y; θ) of standard HMMs.","Therefore, only a forward-backward algorithm is required for the efficient calculation of our parameter estimation process. Note that even though our hybrid model supports the use of a combination of several generative and discriminative models, we only need to calculate the forward-backward algorithm once for each sample during optimization procedures 4.1 and 4.2. This means that the required number of executions of the forward-backward algorithm for our parameter estimation is independent of the number of models used in the hybrid model.","In addition, after training, we can easily merge all the parameter values in a single parameter vector. This means that we can simply employ the Viterbi-algorithm for evaluating unseen samples, as well as that of standard CRFs, without any additional cost."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We examined our hybrid model (HySOL) by applying it to two sequence labeling tasks, named entity recognition (NER) and syntactic chunking (Chunking).

(a) NER (b) Chunking Figure 2: Changes in the performance and the convergence condition value (procedure 4 in Figure 1) of HySOL. cantly improved the performance of supervised setting, CRF and LOP-CRF, as regards both NER and Chunking experiments. 5.1 Impact of Incorporating Unlabeled Data The contributions provided by incorporating unlabeled data in our hybrid model can be seen by comparison with the performance of the first and third rows in HySOL, namely a 2.64 point F-score and a 2.96 point sentence accuracy gain in the NER experiments and a 0.46 point F-score and a 1.99 point sentence accuracy gain in the Chunking experiments.","We believe there are two key ideas that enable the unlabeled data in our approach to exhibit this improvement compared with the the state-of-the-art performance provided by discriminative models in supervised settings. First, unlabeled data is only used for optimizing Equation (4) to obtain a similar effect to ’soft-clustering’, which can be calculated without information about the correct output. Second, by using a combination of generative models, we can enhance the flexibility of the feature design for unlabeled data. For example, we can handle arbitrary overlapping features, similar to those used in discriminative models, for unlabeled data by assign-ing one feature type for one generative model as in our experiments. 5.2 Impact of Iterative Parameter Estimation Figure 2 shows the changes in the performance and the convergence condition value of HySOL during parameter estimation iteration in our NER and Chunking experiments, respectively. As shown in the figure, HySOL was able to reach the conver-797 gence condition in a small number of iterations in our experiments. Moreover, the change in the performance remains quite stable during the iteration. However, theoretically, our optimization procedure is not guaranteed to converge in the Γ and Θ space, since the optimization of Θ has local maxima. Even if we were unable to meet the convergence condition, we were easily able to obtain model parameters by performing a sufficient fixed number of iterations, and then select the parameters when Equation (4) obtained the maximum objective value. 5.3 Comparison with SS-CRF-MER When we consider semi-supervised SOL methods, SS-CRF-MER (Jiao et al., 2006) is the most competitive with HySOL, since both methods are defined based on CRFs. We planned to compare the performance with that of SS-CRF-MER in our NER and Chunking experiments. Unfortunately, we failed to implement SS-CRF-MER since it requires the use of a slightly complicated algorithm, called the ‘nested’ forward-backward algorithm.","Although, we cannot compare the performance, our hybrid approach has several good characteristics compared with SS-CRF-MER. First, it requires a higher order algorithm, namely a ‘nested’ forward-backward algorithm, for the parameter estimation of unlabeled data whose time complexity is O(L3","S2",") for each unlabeled data, where L and S represent the output label size and unlabeled sample length, respectively. Thus, our hybrid approach is more scalable for the size of unlabeled data, since HySOL only needs a standard forward-backward algorithm whose time complexity is O(L2","S). In fact, we still have a question as to whether SS-CRF-MER is really scalable in practical time for such a large amount of unlabeled data as used in our experiments, which is about 680 times larger than that of (Jiao et al., 2006). Scalability for unlabeled data will become really important in the future, as it will be natural to use millions or billions of unlabeled data for further improvement. Second, SS-CRF-MER has a sensitive hyper-parameter in the objective function, which controls the influence of the unlabeled data. In contrast, our objective function only has a hyper-parameter of prior distribution, which is widely used for standard MAP estimation. Moreover, the experimental results shown in Tables 3 and","Fβ=1 additional resources ASO-semi 89.31 unlabeled data (27M words) (Ando and Zhang, 2005) (Florian et al., 2003) 88.76 their own large gazetteers,","2M-word labeled data (Chieu and Ng, 2003) 88.31 their own large gazetteers,","very elaborated features HySOL 88.14 unlabeled data (17M words)","supplied gazetters HySOL 87.20 unlabeled data (17M words) Table 5: Previous top systems in NER (CoNLL-2003) experiments","Fβ=1 additional resources ASO-semi 94.39 unlabeled data (Ando and Zhang, 2005) (15M words: WSJ) HySOL 94.30 unlabeled data","(17M words: Reuters) (Zhang et al., 2002) 94.17 full parser output (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) 93.91 – Table 6: Previous top systems in Chunking (CoNLL-2000) experiments 4 indicate that HySOL is rather robust with respect to the hyper-parameter since we can obtain fairly good performance without a prior distribution. 5.4 Comparison with Previous Top Systems With respect to the performance of NER and Chunking tasks, the current best performance is reported in (Ando and Zhang, 2005), which we refer to as ‘ASO-semi’, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. ASO-semi also incorporates unlabeled data solely for the additional information in the same way as our method. Unfortunately, our results could not reach their level of performance, although the size and source of the unlabeled data are not the same for certain reasons. First, (Ando and Zhang, 2005) does not describe the unlabeled data used in their NER experiments in detail, and second, we are not licensed to use the TREC corpus including WSJ unlabeled data that they used for their Chunking experiments (training and test data for Chunking is derived from WSJ). Therefore, we simply used the supplied unlabeled data of the CoNLL-2003 shared task for both NER and Chunking. If we consider the advantage of our approach, our hybrid model incorporating generative models seems rather intuitive, since it is some-times difficult to find out a design of effective auxiliary problems for the target problem.","Interestingly, the additional information obtained 798","Fβ=1 (gain) HySOL (ξ′","=0.1,η′","=0.0001) 87.20 - + w/ F-score opt.

(Suzuki et al., 2006) 94.36 (+0.06) Table 8: The HySOL performance with the F-score optimization technique on Chunking (CoNLL-2000) experiments from unlabeled data appear different from each other. ASO-semi uses unlabeled data for construct-ing auxiliary problems to find the ‘shared structures’ of auxiliary problems that are expected to improve the performance of the main problem. Moreover, it is possible to combine both methods, for example, by incorporating the features obtained with their method in our base discriminative models, and then construct a hybrid model using our method. Therefore, there may be a possibility of further improving the performance by this simple combination.","In NER, most of the top systems other than ASO-semi boost performance by employing external hand-crafted resources such as large gazetteers. This is why their results are superior to those obtained with HySOL. In fact, if we simply add the gazetteers included in CoNLL-2003 supplied data as features, HySOL achieves 88.14. 5.5 Applying F-score Optimization Technique In addition, we can simply apply the F-score optimization technique for the sequence labeling tasks proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2006) to boost the HySOL performance since the base discriminative models pD","(y| x) and discriminative combination, namely Equation (3), in our hybrid model basically uses the same optimization procedure as CRFs. Tables 7 and 8 show the F-score gain when we apply the F-score optimization technique. As shown in the Tables, the F-score optimization technique can easily improve the (F-score) performance without any additional resources or feature engineering.","In NER, we also examined HySOL with additional resources to observe the performance gain. The third row represents the performance when we add approximately 10M words of unlabeled data (total 27M words)2","that are derived from 1996/11/15-30 articles in Reuters corpus. Then, the fourth and fifth rows represent the performance when we add the supplied gazetters in the CoNLL-2003 data as features, and adding development data as training data of Γ. In this case, HySOL achieved a comparable performance to that of the current best system, ASO-semi, in both NER and Chunking experiments even though the NER experiment is not a fair comparison since we added additional resources (gazetters and dev. set) that ASO-semi does not use in training."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We proposed a framework for semi-supervised SOL based on a hybrid generative and discriminative approach.
