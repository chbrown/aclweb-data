In Wikipedia, an anchor text is glossed in a linked HTML text. We formalize named entity categorization as a task of categorizing anchor texts with linked HTML texts which glosses a named entity. Using this representation, we introduce a graph structure in which anchor texts are regarded as nodes. In order to incorporate HTML structure on the graph, three types of cliques are defined based on the HTML tree structure. We propose a method with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to categorize the nodes on the graph. Since the defined graph may include cycles, the exact inference of CRFs is computationally expensive. We introduce an approximate inference method using Tree-based Reparameterization (TRP) to reduce computational cost. In experiments, our proposed model obtained significant improvements compare to baseline models that use Support Vector Machines."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Named and Numeric Entities (NEs) refer to proper nouns (e.g. PERSON, LOCATION and ORGANIZATION), time expressions, date expressions and so on. Since a large number of NEs exist in the world, unknown expressions appear frequently in texts, and they become hindrance to real-world text analysis. To cope with the problem, one effective ways to add a large number of NEs to gazetteers.","In recent years, NE extraction has been performed with machine learning based methods. However, such methods cannot cover all of NEs in texts. Therefore, it is necessary to extract NEs from existing resources and use them to identify more NEs. There are many useful resources on the Web. We focus on Wikipedia1","as the resource for acquiring NEs. Wikipedia is a free multilingual online encyclopedia and a rapidly growing resource. In Wikipedia, a large number of NEs are described in titles of articles with useful information such as HTML tree structures and categories. Each article links to other related articles. According to these characteristics, they could be an appropriate resource for extracting NEs.","Since a specific entity or concept is glossed in a Wikipedia article, we can regard the NE extraction problem as a document classification problem of the Wikipedia article. In traditional approaches for document classification, in many cases, documents are classified independently. However, the Wikipedia articles are hypertexts and they have a rich structure that is useful for categorization. For example, hyper-linked mentions (we call them anchor texts)which are enumerated in a list tend to refer to the articles that describe other NEs belonging to the same class. It is expected that improved NE categorization is accomplished by capturing such dependencies.","We structure anchor texts and dependencies between them into a graph, and train graph-based CRFs to obtain probabilistic models to estimate categories for NEs in Wikipedia.","So far, several statistical models that can cap-","1","http://wikipedia.org/ 649 ture dependencies between examples have been proposed. There are two types of classification methods that can capture dependencies: iterative classification methods (Neville and Jensen, 2000; Lu and Getoor, 2003b) and collective classification methods (Getoor et al., 2001; Taskar et al., 2002). In this paper, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) for NE categorization in Wikipedia.","The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the general framework of CRFs. Section 3 describes a graph-based CRFs for NE categorization in Wikipedia. In section 4, we show the experimental results. Section 5 describes related work. We conclude in section 6."]},{"title":"2 Conditional Random Fields","paragraphs":["Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are undirected graphical models that give a conditional probability distribution p(y|x) in a form of exponential model.","CRFs are formalized as follows. Let G = {V, E} be an undirected graph over random variables y and x,whereV is a set of vertices, and E is a set of edges in the graph G.

McCallum et al. (2003), Sutton et al (2004) proposed Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (DCRFs), the generaliza-tion of linear-chain CRFs, that have complex graph structure (include cycles). Since DCRFs model structure contains cycles, it is necessary to use approximate inference methods to calculate marginal probability.

One possible approach is to classify each NE described in an article into an appropriate category by exploiting the definition of the article. This process can be done one by one without considering the relationship with other articles.","On the other hand, articles in Wikipedia are semi-structured texts. Especially lists (<UL> or <OL>) and tables (<TABLE>) have an important characteristics, that is, occurrence of elements in them have some sort of dependencies. Structural characteristics, such as lists (<UL> or <OL>) or tables (<TABLE>), are useful becase their elements have some sort of dependencies.","Figure 2 shows an example of an HTML segment and the corresponding tree structure.

Anchor texts are glossed entity or concept described with links to other pages.

In the next section, we describe the concrete way to construct graphs. 3.1 Constructing a graph from an HTML tree An HTML document is an ordered tree. We define a graph G =(V G",",EG",") on an HTML tree T HTML","=(V T",",ET","): the vertices V G","are anchor texts in the HTML text; the edges E are limited to cliques of Sibling, Cousin, and Relative, which we will describe later in the section. These cliques are intended to encode a NE label dependency between anchor texts where the two NEs tend to be in the same or related class, or one NE affects the other NE label.","Let us consider dependent anchor text pairs in Figure 2. First, “Dillard & Clark” and “country rock” have a sibling relation over the tree structure, and appearing the same element of the list. The latter element in this relation tends to be an attribute or a concept of the other element in the relation. Second, “Dillard & Clark” and “Carpenters” have a cousin relation over the tree structure, and they tend to have a common attribute such as “Artist”. The elements in this relation tend to belong to the same class. Third, “Carpenters” and “Karen Carpenter” have a relation in which “Karen Carpenter” is a sibling’s grandchild in relation to “Carpenters” over the tree structure. The latter elements in this relation tends to be a constituent part of the other element in the relation. We can say that the model can capture dependencies by dealing with anchor texts that depend on each other as cliques. Based on the observations as above, we treat a pair of anchor texts as cliques which satisfy the condtions in Figure 1. <UL> <LI> <A> <LI> <LI> <A> <A> <UL><A> Dillard & Clark country rock Carpenters Karen Carpenter Sibling Cousin Relative","Dillard & Clark ...... ...country rock ...

Precise definitions of cliques, namely Sibling, Cousin, and Relative, are given in Figure 1. A set of cliques used in our graph-based CRFs are edges defined in Figure 1 and vertices, i.e. C = ES ∪ EC ∪ ER ∪ V . Note that they are restricted to pairs of the nearest vertices to keep the graph simple. 3.2 Model We introduce potential functions for cliques to define conditional probability distribution over CRFs. Conditional distribution over label set y given ob-651 servation set x is defined as: p(y|x)=","1 Z(x)   ∏ (vi,vj)∈ES∪EC∪ER ΦSCR(yi,yj)     ∏ vi∈V ΦV (yi, x)   (3) where ΦSCR(yi,yj ) is the potential over sibling, cousin and relative edges, ΦV (yi, x) is the potential over the nodes, and Z(x) is the partition function.

Quasi-Newton methods, such as L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) can be used for maximizing the function. 3.3 Tree-based Reparameterization Since the proposed model may include loops, it is necessary to introduce an approximation to calculate mariginal probabilities. For this, we use Tree-based Reparameterization (TRP) (Wainwright et al., 2003) for approximate inference. TRP enumerates a set of spanning trees from the graph. Then, inference is performed by applying an exact inference algorithm such as Belief Propagation to each of the spanning trees, and updates of marginal probabilities are continued until they converge."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset","paragraphs":["Our dataset is a random selection of 2300 articles from the Japanese version of Wikipedia as of Octo-ber 2005. All anchor texts appearing under HTML <LI> tags are hand-annotated with NE class label. We use the Extended Named Entity Hierarchy (Sekine et al., 2002) as the NE class labeling guideline, but reduce the number of classes to 13 from the original 200+ by ignoring fine-grained categories and nearby categories in order to avoid data sparseness. We eliminate examples that consist of less than two nodes in the SCR model. There are 16136 anchor texts with 14285 NEs. The number of Sibling, Cousin and Relative edges in the dataset are |ES | = 4925, |EC | = 13134 and |ER| = 746 respectively. 4.2 Experimental settings The aims of experiments are the two-fold. Firstly, we investigate the effect of each cliques. The several graphs are composed with the three sorts of edges. We also compare the graph-based models with a node-wise method – just MaxEnt method not using any edge dependency. Secondly, we compare the proposed method by CRFs with a baseline method by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1998).","The experimental settings of CRFs and SVMs are as follows.

Figure 3 shows representative graphs of the eight models. When the graph are disconnected by reducing the edges, the classification is performed on each connected subgraph. We call it an example. We name the examples according the graph structure: ”loopy examples” are subgraphs including at least one cycle; ”linear chain or tree examples” are subgraphs including not a cycle but at least an edge; ”one node examples” are subgraphs without edges. Table 1 shows the distribution of the examples of each model. Since SCR, SC, SR and CR model have loopy examples, TRP approximate inference is necessary.

SVMs We introduce two models by SVMs (model I and model P). In model I, each anchor text is classified independently. In model P, we ordered the anchor texts in a linear-chain sequence. Then, we perform a history-based classification along the sequence, in which j − 1-th classification result is used in j-th classification. We use TinySVM with a linear-kernel. One-versus-rest method is used for multi-class classification. To perform training and testing with SVMs, we use TinySVM 2","with a linearkernel, and one-versus-rest is used for multi-class classification. We used the cost of constraint violation C =1.

Relational vs. Independent Among the models constructed by combination of defined cliques, the best F1-value is achieved by CR model, followed by SC, SCR, C, SR, S, R and I. We performed McNemar paired test on labeling disagreements between CR model of CRFs and I model of CRFs. The difference was significant (p<0.01). These results show that considering dependencies work positively in obtaining better accuracy than classifying independently. The Cousin cliques provide the highest accuracy improvement among the three defined cliques. The reason may be that the Cousin cliques appear frequently in comparison with the other cliques, and also possess strong dependencies among anchor texts. As for PERSON, better accuracy is achieved in SC and SCR models. In fact, the PERSON-PERSON pairs frequently appear in Sibling cliques (435 out of 4925) and in Cousin cliques (2557 out of 13125) in the dataset. Also, as for PRODUCT and LOCATION, better accuracy is achieved in the models that contain Cousin cliques (C, CR, SC and SCR model). 1072 PRODUCT-PRODUCT pairs and 738 LOCATION-LOCATION pairs appear in Cousin cliques. “All (no article)” row in Table 3 shows the F1-value of nodes which have no gloss texts. The F1-value difference between CR and I model of CRF in “ALL (no article)” row is larger than the difference in “All” row. The fact means that the dependency information helps to extract NEs without gloss texts in Wikipedia. We attempted a different parameter tying in which the SCR potential functions are tied with a particular observation feature. This parameter tying is introduced by Ghamrawi and McCallum (2005). However, we did not get any improved accuracy. CRFs vs. SVMs The best model of CRFs (CR model) outperforms the best model of SVMs (P model). We performed McNemar paired test on labeling disagreements between CR model of CRFs and P model of SVMs. The difference was significant (p<0.01). In the classes having larger number of examples, models of CRFs achieve better F1-values than models of SVMs. However, in several classes having smaller number of examples such as 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 Recall Precision CR model of CRFs Figure 4: Precision-Recall curve obtained by vary-ing the threshold τ of marginal probability from 1.0 to 0.0. EVENT and UNIT, models of SVMs achieve significantly better F1-values than models of CRFs. Filtering NE Candidates using Marginal Probability The precision-recall curve obtained by thresholding the marginal probability of the MAP estimation in the CR models is shown in Figure 4. The curve reaches a peak at 0.57 in recall, and the precision value at that point is 0.97. This precision and recall values mean that 57% of all NEs can be classified with approximately 97% accuracy on a particular thresholding of marginal probability. This results suggest that the extracted NE candidates can be filtered with fewer cost by exploiting the marginal probability. Training Time The total training times of all CRFs and SVMs models are shown in Table 4. The training time tends to increase in case models have complicated graph structure. For instance, model SCR has complex graph structure compare to model I, therefore the SCR’s training time is three times longer than model I. Training the models by SVMs are faster than training the models by CRFs.
