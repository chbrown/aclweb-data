These texts usually contain some proportion of proper names (e.g., place and people names in “The cities of Mesopotamia prospered under Parthian and Sassanian rule.”), which may not be handled properly by a machine translation system. Online machine translation services such as Google Translate1","or Yahoo! Babelfish2","typically use a bilingual dictionary that is either manually compiled or learned from a par-  1 Google Translate: translate.google.com/translate_t 2 Yahoo! Babelfish: babelfish.yahoo.com allel corpus. However, such dictionaries often have insufficient coverage of proper names and technical terms, leading to poor translation performance due to out of vocabulary (OOV) problem.","Handling name transliteration is also important for cross language information retrieval (CLIR) and terminology translation (Quah 2006). There are also services on the Web specifically targeting transliteration aimed at improving CLIR, including CHINET (Kwok et al. 2005) and LiveTrans (Lu, Chien, and Lee 2004).","The OOV problems of machine translation (MT) or CLIR can be handled more effectively by learning to find transliteration on the Web. Consider the sentence in Example (1), containing three proper names. Google Translate produces the sentence in Example (2) and leaves “Parthian” and “Sassanian” not translated. A good response might be a translation like Example (3) with appropriate transliterations (underlined). (1) The cities of Mesopotamia prospered under","Parthian and Sassanian rule. (2) 城市繁榮下 parthian 達米亞、sassanian 統","治。 (3) 美索不達米亞3","城市在巴底亞4","和薩珊5","統治下","繁榮起來。","These transliterations can be more effectively retrieved from mixed-code Web pages by extend-ing each of the proper names into a query. Intuitively, by requiring one of likely transliteration morphemes (e.g., “巴”(Ba) or “帕”(Pa) for names beginning with the prefix “par-”), we can bias the search engine towards retrieving the correct trans-  3 美索不達米亞(Meisuobudamiya) is the transliteration of “Mesopotamia.” 4 巴底亞(Badiya) is the transliteration of “Parthian.” 5 薩珊(Sashan) is the transliteration of “Sassanian.” 996  Figure 1. An example of TermMine search for transliterations of the name “Parthian”  literations (e.g., “ 巴底亞”(Badiya) and “ 帕提 亞”(Patiya)) in snippets of many top-ranked documents.","This approach to terminology translation by searching is a strategy increasingly adopted by human translators. Quah (2006) described a modern day translator would search for the translation of a difficult technical term such as “異方性導電 樹脂フィルム” by expanding the query with the word “film” (back transliteration of the component “フィルム” of the term in question). This kind of query expansion (QE) indeed increases the chance of finding the correct translation “anisotropic conductive film” in top-ranked snippets. However, the manual process of expanding query, sending search request, and extracting transliteration is tedious and time consuming. Furthermore, unless the query expansion is done properly, snippets containing answers might not be ranked high enough for this strategy to be the most effective.","We present a new system, TermMine, that automatically learns to extend a given name into a query expected to retrieve and extract transliterations of the proper name. An example of machine transliteration of “Parthian” is shown in Figure 1. TermMine has determined the best 10 query expansions (e.g., “Parthian 巴 ,” “Parthian 帕 ”). TermMine learns these effective expansions automatically during training by analyzing a collection of place names and their transliterations, and deriv-ing cross-language relationships of prefix and postfix morphemes. For instance, TermMine learns that a name that begins with the prefix “par-” is likely to have a transliteration beginning with “巴” or “帕”). We describe the learning process in Section 3.","This prototype demonstrates a novel method for learning to find transliterations of proper nouns on the Web based on query expansion aimed at maximizing the probability of retrieving transliterations from existing search engines. Since the method involves learning the morphological relationships between names and their transliterations, we refer to this IR-based approach as morphological query expansion approach to machine transliteration. This novel approach is general in scope and can also be applied to back transliteration and to translation with slight modifications, even though we focus on transliteration in this paper.","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we give a formal statement for the problem (Section 2). Then, we present a solution to the problem by proposing new transliteration probability functions, describing the procedure for estimating parameters for these functions (Section 3) and the run-time procedure for searching and ex-  997  tracting transliteration via a search engine (Section 4). As part of our evaluation, we carry out two sets of experiments, with or without query expansion, and compare the results. We also evaluate the results against two commercial machine translation online services (Section 5)."]},{"title":"2 Problem Statement","paragraphs":["Using online machine translation services for name transliteration does not work very well. Searching in the vicinity of the name in mixed-code Web pages is a good strategy. However, query expansion is needed for this strategy to be effective. Therefore, to find transliterations of a name, a promising approach is to automatically expand the given name into a query with the additional requirement of some morpheme expected to be part of relevant transliterations that might appear on the Web.

Our goal is to search and extract the transliteration T of N from Web pages via a general-purpose search engine SE. For that, we expand N into a set of queries q1, q2, ..., qm, such that the top n document snippets returned by SE for the queries are likely to contain some transliterations T of the given name N. ","In the next section, we propose using a probability function to model the relationships between names and transliterations and describe how the parameters in this function can be estimated."]},{"title":"3 Learning Relationships for QE","paragraphs":["We attempt to derive cross-language morphological relationships between names and transliterations and use them to expand a name into an effective query for searching and extracting transliterations. For the purpose of expanding the given name, N, into effective queries to search and extract transliterations T, we define a probabilistic function for mapping prefix syllable from the source to the target languages. The prefix transliteration function P(TP | NP) is the probability of T has a prefix TP under the condition that the name N has a prefix NP. P (TP | NP) = Count (TP,NP) / Count (NP) (1)","where Count (TP,NP) is the number of TP and NP co-occurring in the pairs of training set (see Table 1), and Count(NP) is the number of NP occurring in training set.  Similarly, we define the function P (TS | NS) for","postfixes TS and NS: P (TS | NS) = Count (TS,NS) / Count (NS) (2)","The prefixes and postfixes are intended as a syllable in the two languages involved, so the two prefixes correspond to each other (See Table 2&3). Due to the differences in the sound inventory, the Roman prefix corresponding to a syllabic prefix in Chinese may vary, ranging from a consonant, a vowel, or a consonant followed by a vowel (but not a vowel followed by a consonant). So, it is likely such a Roman prefix has from one to four letters. On the contrary, the prefix syllable for a name written in Chinese is readily identifiable.  Table 2.

The skew distribution creates problems for reliable estimation of transliteration functions. To cope with this data sparseness problem, we use homophone classes and a function CL that maps homophonic characters to the same class number. For instance, “艾” and “埃” are homophonic, and both are assigned the same class identifier(see Table 4 for more samples).","Therefore, we have CL (“艾”) = CL (“埃”) = 275. Table 4.

In addition to that, we also need a transliteration probability function to rank candidate transliterations at run-time (Section 4).

First, the method explored here can be extended as an alterative way to support such MT subtasks as back transliteration (Knight and Graehl 1998) and noun phrase translation (Koehn and Knight 2003). Finally, for more challenging MT tasks, such as handling sentences, the improvement of translation quality probably will also be achieved by combin-ing this IR-based approach and statistical machine translation.
