This is done by using topic features constructed using the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm on unlabeled data. The features are incorporated into a modified naı̈ve Bayes network alongside other features such as part-of-speech of neighboring words, single words in the surrounding context, local collocations, and syntactic patterns. In both the English all-words task and the English lexical sample task, the method achieved significant improvement over the simple naı̈ve Bayes classifier and higher accuracy than the best official scores on Senseval-3 for both task."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language tends to be ambiguous. A word often has more than one meanings depending on the context. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a natural language processing (NLP) task in which the correct meaning (sense) of a word in a given context is to be determined.","Supervised corpus-based approach has been the most successful in WSD to date. In such an approach, a corpus in which ambiguous words have been annotated with correct senses is first collected. Knowledge sources, or features, from the context of the annotated word are extracted to form the training data. A learning algorithm, like the support vector machine (SVM) or naı̈ve Bayes, is then applied on the training data to learn the model. Finally, in testing, the learnt model is applied on the test data to assign the correct sense to any ambiguous word.","The features used in these systems usually include local features, such as part-of-speech (POS) of neighboring words, local collocations , syntactic patterns and global features such as single words in the surrounding context (bag-of-words) (Lee and Ng, 2002). However, due to the data scarcity problem, these features are usually very sparse in the training data. There are, on average, 11 and 28 training cases per sense in Senseval 2 and 3 lexical sample task respectively, and 6.5 training cases per sense in the SemCor corpus. This problem is especially prominent for the bag-of-words feature; more than hundreds of bag-of-words are usually extracted for each training instance and each feature could be drawn from any English word. A direct consequence is that the global context information, which the bag-of-words feature is supposed to capture, may be poorly represented.","Our approach tries to address this problem by clustering features to relieve the scarcity problem, specifically on the bag-of-words feature. In the process, we construct topic features, trained using the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm. We train the topic model (Blei et al., 2003) on unlabeled data, clustering the words occurring in the corpus to a predefined number of topics. We then use the resulting topic model to tag the bag-of-words in the labeled corpus with topic distributions. We incorporate the distributions, called the topic features, using a simple Bayesian network, modified from naı̈ve Bayes 1015 model, alongside other features and train the model on the labeled corpus. The approach gives good performance on both the lexical sample and all-words tasks on Senseval data.","The paper makes mainly two contributions. First, we are able to show that a feature that efficiently captures the global context information using LDA algorithm can significantly improve the WSD accuracy. Second, we are able to obtain this feature from unlabeled data, which spares us from any manual labeling work. We also showcase the potential strength of Bayesian network in the WSD task, obtaining performance that rivals state-of-arts methods."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Many WSD systems try to tackle the data scarcity problem. Unsupervised learning is introduced primarily to deal with the problem, but with limited success (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). In another approach, the learning algorithm borrows training instances from other senses and effectively increases the training data size. In (Kohomban and Lee, 2005), the classifier is trained using grouped senses for verbs and nouns according to WordNet top-level synsets and thus effectively pooling training cases across senses within the same synset. Similarly, (Ando, 2006) exploits data from related tasks, using all labeled examples irrespective of target words for learning each sense using the Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b). Parallel texts is proposed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997) as potential training data and (Chan and Ng, 2005) has shown that using automatically gathered parallel texts for nouns could significantly increase WSD accuracy, when tested on Senseval-2 English all-words task.","Our approach is somewhat similar to that of using generic language features such as POS tags; the words are tagged with its semantic topic that may be trained from other corpuses."]},{"title":"3 Feature Construction","paragraphs":["We first present the latent dirichlet allocation algorithm and its inference procedures, adapted from the original paper (Blei et al., 2003). 3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA is a probabilistic model for collections of discrete data and has been used in document model-ing and text classification. It can be represented as a three level hierarchical Bayesian model, shown graphically in Figure 1. Given a corpus consisting of M documents, LDA models each document using a mixture over K topics, which are in turn characterized as distributions over words. β wzθα N M Figure 1: Graphical Model for LDA","In the generative process of LDA, for each document d we first draw the mixing proportion over topics θd from a Dirichlet prior with parameters α. Next, for each of the Nd words wdn in document d, a topic zdn is first drawn from a multinomial distribution with parameters θd. Finally wdn is drawn from the topic specific distribution over words. The probability of a word token w taking on value i given that topic z = j was chosen is parameterized using a matrix β with βij = p(w = i|z = j). Integrating out θd’s and zdn’s, the probability p(D|α, β) of the corpus is thus: M ∏ d=1 ∫ p(θd|α)","( Nd ∏ n=1 ∑ zdn p(zdn|θd)p(wdn|zdn, β) ) dθd 3.1.1 Inference","Unfortunately, it is intractable to directly solve the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given a document, namely p(θ, z|w, α, β). However, (Blei et al., 2003) has shown that by introducing a set of variational parameters, γ and φ, a tight lower bound on the log likelihood of the probability can be found using the following optimization procedure:","(γ∗",", φ∗",") = arg min","γ,φ D(q(θ, z|γ, φ)∥p(θ, z|w, α, β)) 1016 where q(θ, z|γ, φ) = q(θ|γ) N ∏ n=1 q(zn|φn), γ is the Dirichlet parameter for φ and the multinomial parameters (φ1 · · · φN ) are the free variational parameters. Note here γ is document specific in-stead of corpus specific like α. Graphically, it is represented as Figure 2. The optimizing values of γ and φ can be found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the variational distribution and the true posterior. γ θ φ z N M Figure 2: Graphical Model for Variational Inference 3.2 Baseline Features For both the lexical sample and all-words tasks, we use the following standard baseline features for comparison. POS Tags For each training or testing word, w, we include POS tags for P words prior to as well as after w within the same sentence boundary. We also include the POS tag of w. If there are fewer than P words prior or after w in the same sentence, we denote the corresponding feature as NIL. Local Collocations Collocation Ci,j refers to the ordered sequence of tokens (words or punctuations) surrounding w. The starting and ending position of the sequence are denoted i and j respectively, where a negative value refers to the token position prior to w. We adopt the same 11 collocation features as (Lee and Ng, 2002), namely C−1,−1, C1,1, C−2,−2, C2,2, C−2,−1, C−1,1, C1,2, C−3,−1, C−2,1, C−1,2, and C1,3. Bag-of-Words For each training or testing word, w, we get G words prior to as well as after w, within the same document. These features are position in-sensitive. The words we extract are converted back to their morphological root forms. Syntactic Relations We adopt the same syntactic relations as (Lee and Ng, 2002). For easy reference, we summarize the features into Table 1.","POS of w Features","Noun Parent headword h POS of h Relative position of h to w","Verb Left nearest child word of w, l Right nearest child word of w, r POS of l POS of r POS of w Voice of w","Adjective Parent headword h POS of h Table 1: Syntactic Relations Features","The exact values of P and G for each task are set according to cross validation result. 3.3 Topic Features We first select an unlabeled corpus, such as 20 Newsgroups, and extract individual words from it (excluding stopwords). We choose the number of topics, K, for the unlabeled corpus and we apply the LDA algorithm to obtain the β parameters, where β represents the probability of a word wi given a topic zj, p(wi|zj) = βij. The model essentially clusters words that occurred in the unlabeled corpus according to K topics. The conditional probability p(wi|zj) = βij is later used to tag the words in the unseen test example with the probability of each topic.","For some variants of the classifiers that we construct, we also use the γ parameter, which is document specific. For these classifiers, we may need to run the inference algorithm on the labeled corpus and possibly on the test documents. The γ parameter provides an approximation to the probability of 1017 selecting topic i in the document: p(zi|γ) = γi","∑ K γk .

Here, w refers to the word. s refers to the sense of the word. In training, s is observed while in testing, it is not. The features f1 to fn are baseline features mentioned in Section 3.2 (including bag-of-words) while z refers to the latent topic that we set for clustering unlabeled corpus. The bag-of-words b are extracted from the neighbours of w and there are L of them. Note that L can be different from G, which is the number of bag-of-words in baseline features. Both will be determined by the validation result. · · ·","} {{ } baselinefeatures w s fnf1 b z L Figure 3: Graphical Model with LDA feature","The log-likelihood of an instance, l(w, s, F, b) where F denotes the set of baseline features, can be written as = logp(w) + logp(s|w) + ∑ F log(p(f |s)) + ∑ L log ( ∑ K p(zk|s)p(bl|zk) ) .","The log p(w) term is constant and thus can be ignored. The first portion is normal naı̈ve Bayes. And second portion represents the additional LDA plate. We decouple the training process into three separate stages. We first extract baseline features from the task training data, and estimate, using normal naı̈ve Bayes, p(s|w) and p(f |s) for all w, s and f . The parameters associated with p(b|z) are estimated using LDA from unlabeled data. Finally we estimate the parameters associated with p(z|s). We experimented with three different ways of both doing the estimation as well as using the resulting model and chose one which performed best empirically. 4.1.1 Expectation Maximization Approach","For p(z|s), a reasonable estimation method is to use maximum likelihood estimation. This can be done using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In classification, we just choose s∗","that maximizes the log-likelihood of the test instance, where:","s∗ = arg max","s l(w, s, F, b)","In this approach, γ is never used which means the LDA inference procedure is not used on any labeled data at all. 4.1.2 Soft Tagging Approach","Classification in this approach is done using the full Bayesian network just as in the EM approach. However we do the estimation of p(z|s) differently. Essentially, we perform LDA inference on the training corpus in order to obtain γ for each document. We then use the γ and β to obtain p(z|b) for each word using p(zi|bl, γ) = p(bl|zi)p(zi|γ)","∑ K p(bl|zk)p(zk|γ) , where equation [1] is used for estimation of p(zi|γ).","This effectively transforms b to a topical distribution which we call a soft tag where each soft tag is probability distribution t1, . . . , tK on topics. We then use this topical distribution for estimating p(z|s). Let si","be the observed sense of instance i and t ij 1 , . . . , t ij K be the soft tag of the j-th bag-of-","word feature of instance i. We estimate p(z|s) as p(zjk|s) =","∑ si =s t ij k","∑ si =s","∑ k′ t ij k′ (2)","This approach requires us to do LDA inference on the corpus formed by the labeled training data, but 1018 not the testing data. This is because we need γ to get transformed topical distribution in order to learn p(z|s) in the training. In the testing, we only apply the learnt parameters to the model. 4.1.3 Hard Tagging Approach","Hard tagging approach no longer assumes that z is latent. After p(z|b) is obtained using the same procedure in Section 4.1.2, the topic zi with the highest p(zi|b) among all K topics is picked to represent z. In this way, b is transformed into a single most “prominent” topic. This topic label is used in the same way as baseline features for both training and testing in a simple naı̈ve Bayes model.","This approach requires us to perform the transformation both on the training as well as testing data, since z becomes an observed variable. LDA inference is done on two corpora, one formed by the training data and the other by testing data, in order to get the respective values of γ. 4.2 Support Vector Machine Approach In the SVM (Vapnik, 1995) approach, we first form a training and a testing file using all standard features for each sense following (Lee and Ng, 2002) (one classifier per sense). To incorporate LDA feature, we use the same approach as Section 4.1.2 to transform b into soft tags, p(z|b). As SVM deals with only observed features, we need to transform b both in the training data and in the testing data. Compared to (Lee and Ng, 2002), the only difference is that for each training and testing case, we have additional L ∗ K LDA features, since there are L bag-of-words and each has a topic distribution represented by K values."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["We describe here the experimental setup on the English lexical sample task and all-words task. We use MXPOST tagger (Adwait, 1996) for POS tagging, Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) for extracting syntactic relations, SVMlight1","for SVM classifier and David Blei’s version of LDA2","for LDA training and inference. All default parameters are used unless mentioned otherwise. For all standard 1","http://svmlight.joachims.org 2","http://www.cs.princeton.edu/b̃lei/lda-c/ baseline features, we use Laplace smoothing but for the soft tag (equation [2]), we use a smoothing parameter value of 2. 5.1 Development Process 5.1.1 Lexical Sample Task","We use the Senseval-2 lexical sample task for preliminary investigation of different algorithms, datasets and other parameters. As the dataset is used extensively for this purpose, only the Senseval-3 lexical sample task is used for evaluation. Selecting Bayesian Network The best achievable result, using the three different Bayesian network approaches, when validating on Senseval-2 test data is shown in Table 2. The parameters that are used are P = 3 and G = 3. EM 68.0 Hard Tagging 65.6 Soft Tagging 68.9 Table 2: Results on Senseval-2 English lexical sample using different Bayesian network approaches.","From the results, it appears that both the EM and the Hard Tagging approaches did not yield as good results as the Soft Tagging approach did. The EM approach ignores the LDA inference result, γ, which we use to get our topic prior. This information is document specific and can be regarded as global context information. The Hard Tagging approach also uses less information, as the original topic distribution is now represented only by the topic with the highest probability of occurring. Therefore, both methods have information loss and are disadvantaged against the Soft Tagging approach. We use the Soft Tagging approach for the Senseval-3 lexical sample and the all-words tasks. Unlabeled Corpus Selection The unlabeled corpus we choose to train LDA include 20 Newsgroups, Reuters, SemCor, Senseval-2 lexical sample data and Senseval-3 lexical sample data. Although the last three are labeled corpora, we only need the words from these corpora and thus they can be regarded as unlabeled too. For Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 data, we define the whole passage for each training and testing instance as one document. 1019 The relative effect using different corpus and combinations of them is shown in Table 3, when validating on Senseval-2 test data using the Soft Tagging approach.

It has a relatively larger corpus size at 1.7 million words in total and also a well balanced topic distribution among its documents, rang-ing across politics, finance, science, computing, etc. The Reuters corpus, on the other hand, focuses heavily on finance related articles and has a rather skewed topic distribution. This probably contributed to its inferior result. However, we found that the best result comes from combining all the corpora together with K = 60 and L = 40. Results for Optimized Configuration As baseline for the Bayesian network approaches, we use naı̈ve Bayes with all baseline features. For the baseline SVM approach, we choose P = 3 and include all the words occurring in the training and testing passage as bag-of-words feature.","The F-measure result we achieve on Senseval-2 test data is shown in Table 4. Our four systems are listed as the top four entries in the table. Soft Tag refers to the soft tagging Bayesian network approach. Note that we used the Senseval-2 test data for optimizing the configuration (as is done in the ASO result). Hence, the result should not be taken as reliable. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the improvement of Bayesian network approach over its baseline is very significant (+5.5%). On the other hand, SVM with topic features shows limited improvement over its baseline (+0.8%).

We follow the common practice of using the SemCor corpus as our training data. However, we did not use SVM approach in this task as there are too few training instances per sense for SVM to achieve a reasonably good accuracy.","As there are more training instances in SemCor, 230, 000 in total, we obtain the optimal configuration using 10 fold cross validation on the SemCor training data. With the optimal configuration, we test our system on both Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 official test data.","For baseline features, we set P = 3 and B = 1.

One possible reason is that SVM baseline is able to use all bag-of-words from surrounding context while naı̈ve Bayes baseline can only use very few without decreasing its accuracy, due to the sparse representation. In this sense, SVM baseline already captures some of the topical information, leaving a smaller room for improvement. In fact, if we exclude the bag-of-words feature from the SVM baseline and add in the topic features, we are able to achieve almost the same accuracy as we did with both features included, as shown in Table 9.
