Research New York, NY 10011 kpapi@yahoo-inc.com Abstract","paragraphs":["Given multiple translations of the same source sentence, how to combine them to produce a translation that is better than any single system output? We propose a hierarchical system combination framework for machine translation. This framework integrates multiple MT systems’ output at the word-, phrase- and sentence- levels. By boosting common word and phrase translation pairs, pruning unused phrases, and exploring decoding paths adopted by other MT systems, this framework achieves better translation quality with much less re-decoding time. The full sentence translation hypotheses from multiple systems are additionally selected based on N-gram language models trained on word/word-POS mixed stream, which further improves the translation quality. We consistently observed significant improvements on several test sets in multiple languages covering different genres."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Many machine translation (MT) frameworks have been developed, including rule-based transfer MT, corpus-based MT (statistical MT and example-based MT), syntax-based MT and the hybrid, statistical MT augmented with syntactic structures. Different MT paradigms have their strengths and weaknesses. ∗ This work was done when the author was at IBM Research. Systems adopting the same framework usually produce different translations for the same input, due to their differences in training data, preprocessing, alignment and decoding strategies. It is beneficial to design a framework that combines the decoding strategies of multiple systems as well as their outputs and produces translations better than any single system output. More recently, within the GALE1 project, multiple MT systems have been developed in each consortium, thus system combination be-comes more important.","Traditionally, system combination has been conducted in two ways: glass-box combination and black-box combination. In the glass-box combination, each MT system provides detailed decoding information, such as word and phrase translation pairs and decoding lattices. For example, in the multi-engine machine translation system (Nirenburg and Frederking, 1994), target language phrases from each system and their corresponding source phrases are recorded in a chart structure, together with their confidence scores. A chart-walk algorithm is used to select the best translation from the chart. To combine words and phrases from multiple systems, it is preferable that all the systems adopt similar preprocessing strategies.","In the black-box combination, individual MT systems only output their top-N translation hypotheses without decoding details. This is particularly appealing when combining the translation outputs from COTS MT systems. The final translation may be selected by voted language models and appropriate confidence rescaling schemes ((Tidhar and Kuss-","1","http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/gale/index.htm 277 ner, 2000) and (Nomoto, 2004)). (Mellebeek et al., 2006) decomposes source sentences into meaningful constituents, translates them with component MT systems, then selects the best segment translation and combine them based on majority voting, language models and confidence scores.","(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) proposed another black-box system combination strategy. Given single top-one translation outputs from multiple MT systems, their approach reconstructs a phrase lattice by aligning words from different MT hypotheses. The alignment is based on the surface form of individual words, their stems (after morphology analysis) and part-of-speech (POS) tags. Aligned words are connected via edges. The algorithm finds the best alignment that minimizes the number of crossing edges. Finally the system generates a new translation by searching the lattice based on alignment information, each system’s confidence scores and a language model score. (Matusov et al., 2006) and (Rosti et al., 2007) constructed a confusion net-work from multiple MT hypotheses, and a consensus translation is selected by redecoding the lattice with arc costs and confidence scores.","In this paper, we introduce our hierarchical system combination strategy. This approach allows combination on word, phrase and sentence levels. Similar to glass-box combination, each MT system provides detailed information about the translation process, such as which source word(s) generates which target word(s) in what order. Such information can be combined with existing word and phrase translation tables, and the augmented phrase table will be significantly pruned according to reliable MT hypotheses. We select an MT system to re-translate the test sentences with the refined models, and encourage search along decoding paths adopted by other MT systems. Thanks to the refined translation models, this approach produces better translations with a much shorter re-decoding time. As in the black-box combination, we select full sentence translation hypotheses from multiple system outputs based on n-gram language models. This hierarchical system combination strategy avoids problems like translation output alignment and confidence score normalization. It seamlessly integrates detailed decoding information and translation hypotheses from multiple MT engines, and produces better translations in an efficient manner. Empirical studies in a later section show that this algorithm improves MT quality by 2.4 BLEU point over the best baseline decoder, with a 1.4 TER reduction. We also observed consistent improvements on several evaluation test sets in multiple languages covering different genres by combining several state-of-the-art MT systems.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we briefly introduce several baseline MT systems whose outputs are used in the system combination. In section 3, we present the proposed hierarchical system combination framework. We will describe word and phrase combination and pruning, decoding path imitation and sentence translation selection. We show our experimental results in section 4 and conclusions in section 5."]},{"title":"2 Baseline MT System Overview","paragraphs":["In our experiments, we take the translation outputs from multiple MT systems. These include phrase-based statistical MT systems (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) (Block) and (Hewavitharana et al., 2005) (CMU SMT) , a direct translation model (DTM) system (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) and a hierarchical phrased-based MT system (Hiero) (Chiang, 2005). Different translation frameworks are adopted by different decoders: the DTM decoder combines different features (source words, morphemes and POS tags, target words and POS tags) in a maximum entropy framework. These features are integrated with a phrase translation table for flexible distortion model and word selection. The CMU SMT decoder extracts testset-specific bilingual phrases on the fly with PESA algorithm. The Hiero system extracts context-free grammar rules for long range constituent reordering.","We select the IBM block decoder to re-translate the test set for glass-box system combination. This system is a multi-stack, multi-beam search decoder. Given a source sentence, the decoder tries to find the translation hypothesis with the minimum translation cost. The overall cost is the log-linear combination of different feature functions, such as translation model cost, language model cost, distortion cost and sentence length cost. The translation cost 278 between a phrase translation pair (f, e) is defined as T M (e, f ) = ∑ i λiφ(i) (1) where feature cost functions φ(i) includes:","− log p(f |e), a target-to-source word translation cost, calculated based on unnormalized IBM model1 cost (Brown et al., 1994); p(f |e) = ∏ j ∑ i t(fj|ei) (2) where t(fj|ei) is the word translation probabilities, estimated based on word alignment frequencies over all the training data. i and j are word positions in target and source phrases.","− log p(e|f ), a source-to-target word translation cost, calculated similar to − log p(f |e);","S(e, f ), a phrase translation cost estimated according to their relative alignment frequency in the bilingual training data, S(e, f ) = − log P (e|f ) = − log C(f, e) C(f ) . (3) λ’s in Equation 1 are the weights of different feature functions, learned to maximize development set BLEU scores using a method similar to (Och, 2003).","The SMT system is trained with testset-specific training data. This is not cheating. Given a test set, from a large bilingual corpora we select parallel sentence pairs covering n-grams from source sentences. Phrase translation pairs are extracted from the subsampled alignments. This not only reduces the size of the phrase table, but also improves topic relevancy of the extracted phrase pairs. As a results, it improves both the efficiency and the performance of machine translation."]},{"title":"3 Hierarchical System Combination Framework","paragraphs":["The overall system combination framework is shown in Figure 1. The source text is translated by multiple baseline MT systems. Each system produces both top-one translation hypothesis as well as phrase pairs and decoding path during translation. The information is shared through a common XML file format, as shown in Figure 2. It demonstrates how a source sentence is segmented into a sequence of phrases, the order and translation of each source phrase as well as the translation scores, and a vector of feature scores for the whole test sentence. Such XML files are generated by all the systems when they translate the source test set.","We collect phrase translation pairs from each decoder’s output. Within each phrase pair, we identify word alignment and estimate word translation probabilities. We combine the testset-specific word translation model with a general model. We aug-ment the baseline phrase table with phrase translation pairs extracted from system outputs, then prune the table with translation hypotheses. We re-translate the source text using the block decoder with updated word and phrase translation models. Additionally, to take advantage of flexible reordering strategies of other decoders, we develop a word order cost function to reinforce search along decoding paths adopted by other decoders. With the refined translation models and focused search space, the block decoder efficiently produces a better translation output. Finally, the sentence hypothesis selection module selects the best translation from each systems’ top-one outputs based on language model scores. Note that the hypothesis selection module does not require detailed decoding information, thus can take in any MT systems’ outputs. 3.1 Word Translation Combination The baseline word translation model is too general for the given test set. Our goal is to construct a testset-specific word translation model, combine it with the general model to boost consensus word translations. Bilingual phrase translation pairs are read from each system-generated XML file. Word alignments are identified within a phrase pair based on IBM Model-1 probabilities. As the phrase pairs are typically short, word alignments are quite accurate. We collect word alignment counts from the whole test set translation, and estimate both source-to-target and target-to-source word translation probabilities. We combine such testset-specific translation model with the general model.","t′′ (e|f ) = γt′","(e|f ) + (1 − γ)t(e|f ); (4) where t′","(e|f ) is the testset-specific source-to-target word translation probability, and t(e|f ) is the prob-279 <tr engine=\"XXX\"> <s id=\"0\"> <w> </w><w> </w><w> </w><w> </w><w>","</w><w> </w><w> </w><w> </w><w> </w><w> </w><w>","</w></s> <hyp r=\"0\" c=\"2.15357\"> <t> <p al=\"0-0\" cost=\"0.0603734\"> erdogan </p> <p al=\"1-1\" cost=\"0.367276\"> emphasized </p> <p al=\"2-2\" cost=\"0.128066\"> that </p> <p al=\"3-3\" cost=\"0.0179338\"> turkey </p> <p al=\"4-5\" cost=\"0.379862\"> would reject any </p> <p al=\"6-6\" cost=\"0.221536\"> pressure </p> <p al=\"7-7\" cost=\"0.228264\"> to urge them </p> <p al=\"8-8\" cost=\"0.132242\"> to</p> <p al=\"9-9\" cost=\"0.113983\"> recognize </p> <p al=\"10-10\" cost=\"0.133359\"> Cyprus </p> </t> <sco> 19.6796 8.40107 0.333514 0.00568583 0.223554 0 0.352681 0.01 -0.616 0.009 0.182052 </sco> </hyp> </tr>"," Figure 2: Sample XML file format.

In our experiments, we set γ to be 0.8. We combine both source-to-target and target-to-source word translation models, and update the word translation costs, − log p(e|f ) and − log p(f |e), accordingly.","3.2 Phrase Translation Combination and Pruning Phrase translation pairs can be combined in two different ways. We may collect and merge testset-specific phrase translation tables from each system, if they are available. Essentially, this is similar to combining the training data of multiple MT systems. The new phrase translation probability is calculated according to the updated phrase alignment frequencies:","P ′ (e|f ) = Cb(f, e) +","∑ αmCm(f, e) Cb(f ) +","∑ αmCm(f ) , (5) where Cb is the phrase pair count from the baseline block decoder, and Cm is the count from other MT systems. αm is a system-specific linear combination weight. If not all the phrase tables are available, we collect phrase translation pairs from system outputs, and merge them with Cb. In such case, we may adjust α to balance the small counts from system outputs and large counts from Cb.","The corresponding phrase translation cost is updated as","S′ (e, f ) = − log P ′","(e|f ). (6)","Another phrase combination strategy works on the sentence level. This strategy relies on the consensus of different MT systems when translating the same source sentence. It collects phrase translation pairs used by different MT systems to translate the same sentence. Similarly, it boosts common phrase pairs that are selected by multiple decoders.","S′′ (e, f ) = β","|C(f, e)|","× S′ (e, f ), (7) where β is a boosting factor, 0 < β ≤ 1 . |C(f, e)| is the number of systems that use phrase pair (f, e) to translate the input sentence. A phrase translation pair selected by multiple systems is more likely a good translation, thus costs less.","The combined phrase table contains multiple translations for each source phrase. Many of them 280 are unlikely translations given the context. These phrase pairs produce low-quality partial hypotheses during hypothesis expansion, incur unnecessary model cost calculation and larger search space, and reduce the translation efficiency. More importantly, the translation probabilities of correct phrase pairs are reduced as some probability mass is distributed among incorrect phrase pairs. As a result, good phrase pairs may not be selected in the final translation.","Oracle experiments show that if we prune the phrase table and only keep phrases that appear in the reference translations, we can improve the translation quality by 10 BLEU points. This shows the potential gain by appropriate phrase pruning. We developed a phrase pruning technique based on self-training. This approach reinforces phrase translations learned from MT system output. Assuming we have reasonable first-pass translation outputs, we only keep phrase pairs whose target phrase is covered by existing system translations. These phrase pairs include those selected in the final translations, as well as their combinations or sub-phrases. As a result, the size of the phrase table is reduced by 80-90%, and the re-decoding time is reduced by 80%. Because correct phrase translations are as-signed higher probabilities, it generates better translations with higher BLEU scores. 3.3 Decoding Path Imitation Because of different reordering models, words in the source sentence can be translated in different orders. The block decoder has local reordering capability that allows source words within a given window to jump forward or backward with a certain cost. The DTM decoder takes similar reordering strategy, with some variants like dynamic window width depend-ing on the POS tag of the current source word. The Hiero system allows for long range constituent reordering based on context-free grammar rules. To combine different reordering strategies from various decoders, we developed a reordering cost function that encourages search along decoding paths adopted by other decoders.","From each system’s XML file, we identify the order of translating source words based on word alignment information. For example, given the following hypothesis path,","<p al=”0-1”> izzat ibrahim </p> <p al=”2-2”> receives </p> <p al=”3-4”> an economic official </p> <p al=”5-6”> in </p> <p al=”7-7”> baghdad </p>","We find the source phrase containing words [0,1] is first translated into a target phrase “izzat ibrahim”, which is followed by the translation from source word 2 to a single target word “receives”, etc.. We identify the word alignment within the phrase translation pairs based on IBM model-1 scores. As a result, we get the following source word translation sequence from the above hypothesis (note: source word 5 is translated as NULL):","0 < 1 < 2 < 4 < 3 < 6 < 7","Such decoding sequence determines the translation order between any source word pairs, e.g., word 4 should be translated before word 3, 6 and 7. We collect such ordered word pairs from all system outputs’ paths. When re-translating the source sentence, for each partially expanded decoding path, we compute the ratio of word pairs that satisfy such ordering constraints2",".","Specifically, given a partially expanded path P = {s1 < s2 < · · · < sm}, word pair (si < sj) implies si is translated before sj. If word pair (si < sj) is covered by a full decoding path Q (from other system outputs), we denote the relationship as (si < sj) ∈ Q.","For any ordered word pair (si < sj ) ∈ P , we define its matching ratio as the percentage of full decoding paths that cover it: R(si < sj) = |Q| N , {Q|(si < sj) ∈ Q} (8)","where N is the total number of full decoding paths. We define the path matching cost function: L(P ) = − log","∑ ∀(si<sj)∈P R(si < sj) ∑","∀(si<sj)∈P 1 (9)","The denominator is the total number of ordered word pairs in path P . As a result, partial paths are boosted if they take similar source word translation orders as other system outputs. This cost function is multiplied with a manually tuned model weight before integrating into the log-linear cost model framework.","2","We set no constraints for source words that are translated into NULL. 281 3.4 Sentence Hypothesis Selection The sentence hypothesis selection module only takes the final translation outputs from individual systems, including the output from the glass-box combination. For each input source sentence, it selects the “optimal” system output based on certain feature functions.","We experiment with two feature functions. One is a typical 5-gram word language model (LM). The optimal translation output E′","is selected among the top-one hypothesis from all the systems according to their LM scores. Let ei be a word in sentence E:","E′ = arg min","E − log P5glm(E) (10)","= arg min E ∑ i","− log p(ei|ei−1 i−4), where ei−1","i−4 is the n-gram history, (ei−4, ei−3, ei−2, ei−1).","Another feature function is based on the 5-gram LM score calculated on the mixed stream of word and POS tags of the translation output. We run POS tagging on the translation hypotheses. We keep the word identities of top N frequent words (N =1000 in our experiments), and the remaining words are replaced with their POS tags. As a result, the mixed stream is like a skeleton of the original sentence, as shown in Figure 3.","With this model, the optimal translation output E∗ is selected based on the following formula:","E∗ = arg min","E − log Pwplm(E) (11)","= arg min E ∑ i","− log p(T (ei)|T (e)i−1 i−4) where the mixed stream token T (e) = e when e ≤ N , and T (e) = P OS(e) when e > N . Similar to a class-based LM, this model is less prone to data sparseness problems."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We experiment with different system combination strategies on the NIST 2003 Arabic-English MT evaluation test set.
