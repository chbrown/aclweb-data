T is said to entail H, denoted by T → H, if the meaning of H can be in-ferred from the meaning of T (Dagan et al., 2005; Dagan and Glickman., 2004). Even though this no-tion has been recently proposed in the computational linguistics literature, it has already attracted a great attention due to the very high generality of its settings and to the indubitable usefulness of its (potential) applications.","In this paper, we concentrate on the problem of lexical entailment, a textual entailment subtask in which the system is asked to decide whether the substitution of a particular word w with the word e in a coherent text Hw = Hl","wHr","generates a sentence He = Hl","eHr","such that H","w → He, where Hl","and","Hr denote the left and the right context of w, re-","spectively. For example, given the word ‘weapon’ a system may substitute it with the synonym ‘arm’, in order to identify relevant texts that denote the sought concept using the latter term. A particular case of lexical entailment is recognizing synonymy, where both Hw → He and He → Hw hold.","In the literature, slight variations of this problem are also referred to as sense matching (Dagan et al., 2006), lexical reference (Glickman et al., 2006a) and lexical substitution (Glickman et al., 2006b). They have been applied to a wide variety of tasks, such as semantic matching, subtitle generation and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Modeling lexical entailment is also a prerequisite to approach the SemEval-2007 lexical substitution task1",", consisting of finding alternative words that can occur in given context.","In this paper, we propose to apply an approach for lexical entailment to the ontology population task. The basic idea is that if a word entails another one in a given context then the former is an instance or a subclass of the latter. This approach is intuitively appealing because lexical entailment is intrinsically an unsupervised task, therefore it does not require lexical resources, seed examples or manually annotated data sets. Unsupervised approaches are particularly suited for ontology population, whose goal is to find instances of concepts from corpora, because both corpus and the ontology sizes can scale up to millions of documents and thousands of concepts, preventing us from applying supervised learning. In addition, the top level part of the ontology (i.e., the Tbox in the Description Logics terminology) is very 1 http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/","tasks/task10/description.shtml 248 often modified during the ontology engineering lifecycle, for example by introducing new concepts and restructuring the subclass of hierarchy according to the renewed application needs required by the evolution of the application domain. It is evident that to preserve the consistency between the Tbox and the Abox (i.e., the set of instances and their relations) in such a dynamic ontology engineering process, supervised approaches are clearly inadequate, as small changes in the TBox will be reflected into dramatic annotation effort to keep instances in the Abox aligned.","The problem of populating a predefined ontology of concepts with novel instances implies a WSD task, as the entities in texts are ambiguous with respect to the domain ontology. For example, the entity Washington is both the name of a state and the name of a city. In the ontology population settings traditional WSD approaches cannot be directly applied since entities are not reported into dictionaries, making the lexical entailment alternative more viable. In particular, we model the problem of ontology population as the problem of recognizing for each mention of an entity of a particular coarse-grained type (e.g., location) the fine-grained concept (e.g., lake or mountain) that can be substituted in texts preserving the meaning. For example, in the sentence “the first man to climb the Everest without oxygen”, “Everest” can be substituted with the word mountain preserving the meaning, while the sentence is meaningless when “Everest” is replaced with the word lake. Following the lexical entailment approach, the ontology population task is transformed into the problem of recognizing the term from a fine-grained set of categories (e.g., city, country, river, lake and mountain) that can be substituted in the contexts where the entity is mentioned (e.g., Everest in the example above).","The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, we propose a novel approach to lexical entailment, called Instance Based Lexical Entailment (IBLE), that allows approaching the problem as a classification task, in which a given target word (i.e., the entailing word) in a particular context is judged to entail a different word taken from a (pre-defined) set of (possible) candidate entailed words (see Section 3). Second, we exploit the IBLE approach to model the ontology population task as follows. Given a set of candidate concepts belonging to generic ontological types (e.g., people or locations), and a set of pre-recognized mentions of entities of these types in the corpus (e.g., Newton, Ontario), we assign the entity to the class whose lexicalization is more frequently entailed in the corpus. In particular, as training set to learn the fine-grained category models, we use all the occurrences of their corresponding expressions in the same corpus (e.g., we collected all occurrences in context of the word scientist to describe the concept scientist). Then, we apply the trained model to classify the pre-recognized coarse-grained entities into the fine-grained categories.","Our approach is fully unsupervised as for training it only requires occurrences of the candidate entailed words taken in their contexts. Restricted to the ontology population task, for each coarse-grained entity (e.g., location), the candidate entailed words are the terms corresponding to the fine-grained classes (e.g., lake or mountain) and the entailing words are mentions of entities (e.g., New York, Ontario) belonging to the coarse-grained class, recognized by an entity tagger.","Experiments show that our method for recognizing lexical entailment is effective for the ontology population task, reporting improvements over a state-of-the-art unsupervised technique based on contextual similarity measures (Cimiano and Völker, 2005). In addition, we also compared it to a supervised approach (Tanev and Magnini, 2006), that we regarded as an upper bound, obtaining comparable results."]},{"title":"2 The Ontology Population Task","paragraphs":["Populating concepts of a predefined ontology with instances found in a corpus is a primary goal of knowledge management systems. As concepts in the ontology are generally structured into hierarchies belonging to a common ontological type (e.g., people or locations), the problem of populating ontologies can be solved hierarchically, firstly identifying instances in texts as belonging to the topmost concepts, and then assigning them to a fine-grained class. Supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems can be used for accomplishing the first step. State-of-the-art NER systems are characterized by 249 high accuracy, but they require a large amount of training data. However, domain specific ontologies generally contains many “fine-grained” categories (e.g., particular categories of people, such as writers, scientists, and so on) and, as a consequence, supervised methods cannot be used because the annotation costs would become prohibitive.","Therefore, in the literature, the fine-grained classification task has been approached by adopting weakly supervised (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) or unsupervised methods (Cimiano and Völker, 2005). Tanev and Magnini (2006) proposed a weakly supervised method that requires as training data a list of terms without context for each class under consideration. Such list can be automatically acquired from existing ontologies or other sources (i.e., database fields, web sites like Wikipedia, etc.) since the approach imposes virtually no restrictions on them. Given a generic syntactically parsed corpus containing at least each training entity twice, the algorithm learns, for each class, a feature vector describing the contexts where those entities occur. Then it compares the new (unknown) entity with the so obtained feature vectors, assigning it to the most similar class. Fleischman and Hovy (2002) approached the ontology population problem as a classification task, providing examples of instances in their context as training examples for their respective fine-grained categories.","The aforementioned approaches are clearly inadequate to recognize such fine-grained distinctions, as they would require a time consuming and costly annotation process for each particular class, that is clearly infeasible when the number of concepts in the ontology scales up. Therefore, most of the present research in ontology population is focus-ing on either unsupervised approaches (Cimiano and Völker, 2005) or weakly supervised approaches (Tanev and Magnini, 2006).","Unsupervised approaches are mostly based on term similarity metrics. Cimiano and Völker (2005) assign a particular entity to the fine-grained class such that the contextual similarity is maximal among the set of fine-grained subclasses of a coarse-grained category. Contextual similarity has been measured by adopting lexico-syntactic features provided by a dependency parser, as proposed in (Lin, 1998)."]},{"title":"3 Instance Based Lexical Entailment","paragraphs":["Dagan et al. (2006) adapted the classical supervised WSD setting to approach the sense matching problem (i.e., the binary lexical entailment problem of deciding whether a word, such as position, entails a different word, such as job, in a given context) by defining a one-class learning algorithm based on support vector machines (SVM). They train a one-class model for each entailed word (e.g., all the occurrences of the word job in the corpus) and, then, apply it to classify all the occurrences of the entailing words (e.g., the word position), providing a binary decision criterion2",". Similarly to the WSD case, examples are represented by feature vectors describing their contexts, and then compared to the feature vectors describing the context of the target word.","In this paper, we adopt a similar strategy to approach a multi-class lexical entailment problem. The basic hypothesis is that if a word w entails e in a particular context (Hw → He), then some of the contexts T","j","e in which e occurs in the training corpus are similar to Hw. Given a word w and an (exhaustive) set of candidate entailed words E = {e1, e2, . . . , en}, to which we refer hereafter with the expression “substitution lexica”, our goal is to select the word ei ∈ E that can be substituted to w in the context Hw generating a sentence He such that Hw → He. In the multi-class setting, supervised learning approaches can be used. In particular, we can apply a one-versus-all learning methodology, in which each class ei is trained from both positive (i.e., all the occurrences of ei in the corpus) and negative examples (i.e., all the occurrences of the words in the set {ej|j ̸= i}).","Our approach is clearly a simplification of the more general lexical entailment settings, where given two generic words w and e, and a context H = Hl","wHr",", the system is asked to decide whether w entails e or not. In fact, the latter is a binary classification problem, while the former is easier as the system is required to select “the best” option among the substitution lexicon. Of course providing such set could be problematic in many cases (e.g., it could be incomplete or simply not available for","2","This approach resembles the pseudo-words technique proposed to evaluate WSD algorithms at the earlier stages of the WSD studies (Gale et al., 1992), when large scale sense tagged corpora were not available for training supervised algorithms. 250 many languages or rare words). On the other hand, such a simplification is practically effective. First of all, it allows us to provide both positive and negative examples, avoiding the use of one-class classification algorithms that in practice perform poorly (Dagan et al., 2006). Second, the large availability of manually constructed substitution lexica, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), or the use of repositories based on statistical word similarities, such as the database constructed by Lin (1998), allows us to find an adequate substitution lexicon for each target word in most of the cases.","For example, as shown in Table 1, the word job has different senses depending on its context, some of them entailing its direct hyponym position (e.g., “looking for permanent job”), others entailing the word task (e.g., “the job of repairing”). The problem of deciding whether a particular instance of job can be replaced by position, and not by the word place, can be solved by looking for the most similar contexts where either position or place occur in the training data, and then selecting the class (i.e., the entailed word) characterized by the most similar ones, in an instance based style. In the first example (see row 1), the word job is strongly associated to the word position, because the contexts of the latter in the examples 1 and 2 are similar to the context of the former, and not to the word task, whose contexts (4, 5 and 6) are radically different. On the other hand, the second example (see row 2) of the word job is similar to the occurrences 4 and 5 of the word task, allowing its correct substitution.","It is worthwhile to remark that, due to the ambiguity of the entailed words (e.g., position could also entail either perspective or place), not every occurrence of them should be taken into account, in order to avoid misleading predictions caused by the irrelevant senses. Therefore, approaches based on a more classical contextual similarity technique (Lin, 1998; Dagan, 2000), where words are described “globally” by context vectors, are doomed to fail. We will provide empirical evidence of this in the evaluation section.","Choosing an appropriate similarity function for the contexts of the words to be substituted is a primary issue. In this work, we exploited similarity functions already defined in the WSD literature, relying on the analogy between the lexical entailment and the WSD task. The state-of-the-art supervised WSD methodology, reporting the best results in most of the Senseval-3 lexical sample tasks in different languages, is based on a combination of syntagmatic and domain kernels (Gliozzo et al., 2005) in a SVM classification framework. Therefore, we adopted exactly the same strategy for our purposes.","A great advantage of this methodology is that it is totally corpus based, as it does not require neither the availability of lexical databases, nor the use of complex preprocessing steps such as parsing or anaphora resolution, allowing us to apply it on different languages and domains once large corpora are available for training. Therefore, we exploited exactly the same strategy to implement the IBLE classifier required for our purposes, defining a kernel composed by n simple kernels, each representing a different aspect to be considered when estimating contextual similarity among word occurrences. In fact, by using the closure properties of the kernel functions, it is possible to define the kernel combination schema as follows3",": KC (xi, xj) = n ∑ l=1 Kl(xi, xj)","√ Kl(xj, xj)Kl(xi, xi) , (1) where Kl are valid kernel functions, measuring similarity between the objects xi and xj from different perspectives4",".","One means to satisfy both the WSD and the lexical entailment requirements is to consider two different aspects of similarity: domain aspects, mainly related to the topic (i.e., the global context) of the texts in which the word occurs, and syntagmatic aspects, concerning the lexico-syntactic pattern in the local context. Domain aspects are captured by the domain kernel, described in Section 3.1, while syntagmatic aspects are taken into account by the syntagmatic kernel, presented in Section 3.2.","3","Some recent works (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Gliozzo et al., 2005) empirically demostrate the effectiveness of combining kernels in this way, showing that the combined kernel always improves the performance of the individual ones. In addition, this formulation allows evaluating the individual contribution of each information source.","4","An exhaustive discussion about kernel methods for NLP can be found in (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). 251","Entailed job Training","position ... looking for permanent academic job in ... 1 ... from entry-level through permanent positions. 2 My academic position ... 3 ... put the lamp in the left position ...","task The job of repairing 4 The task of setting up ... 5 Repairing the engine is an hard task. 6 ... task based evaluation. Table 1: IBLE example. 3.1 The Domain Kernel (Magnini et al., 2002) claim that knowing the domain of the text in which the word is located is a crucial information for WSD. For example the (domain) polysemy among the Computer Science and the Medicine senses of the word virus can be solved by simply considering the domain of the context in which it is located. Domain aspects are also crucial in recognizing lexical entailment. For example, the term virus entails software agent in the Computer Science domain (e.g., “The laptop has been infected by a virus”), while it entails bacterium when located in the Medicine domain (e.g., “HIV is a virus”). As argued in (Magnini et al., 2002), domain aspects can be considered by an-alyzing the lexicon in a large context of the word to be disambiguated, regardless of the actual word order. We refer to (Gliozzo et al., 2005) for a detailed description of the domain kernel. The simplest methodology to estimate the domain similarity among two texts is to represent them by means of vectors in the Vector Space Model (VSM), and to exploit the cosine similarity. The VSM is a kdimensional space Rk",", in which the text t","j is represented by means of the vector ⃗tj such that the ith component of ⃗tj is the term frequency of the term wi in it. The similarity between two texts in the VSM is estimated by computing the cosine between them, providing the kernel function KV SM that can be used as a basic tool to estimate domain similarity between texts5",".","5","In (Gliozzo et al., 2005), in addition to the standard VSM, a domain kernel, exploiting external information acquired from unlabeled data, has been also used to reduce the amount of (labeled) training data. Here, given that our approach is fully unsupervised, i.e., we can obtain as many examples as we need, we do not use the domain kernel. 3.2 The Syntagmatic Kernel Syntagmatic aspects are probably the most important evidence for recognizing lexical entailment. In general, the strategy adopted to model syntagmatic relations in WSD is to provide bigrams and trigrams of collocated words as features to describe local contexts (Yarowsky, 1994). The main drawback of this approach is that non contiguous or shifted collocations cannot be identified, decreasing the generalization power of the learning algorithm. For example, suppose that the word job has to be disambiguated into the sentence “. . . permanent academic job in. . . ”, and that the occurrence “We offer permanent positions. . . ” is provided for training. A traditional feature mapping would extract the context words w−1:academic, w−2:permanent to represent the former, and w−1:permanent, w−2:offer to index the latter. Evidently such features will not match, leading the algorithm to a mis-classification.","The syntagmatic kernel, proposed by Gliozzo et al. (2005), is an attempt to solve this problem. It is based on a gap-weighted subsequences kernel (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). In the spirit of kernel methods, this kernel is able to compare sequences directly in the input space, avoiding any explicit feature mapping. To perform this operation, it counts how many times a (non-contiguous) subsequence of symbols u of length n occurs in the input string s, and penalizes non-contiguous occurrences according to the number of the contained gaps. To define our syntagmatic kernel, we adapted the generic definition of the sequence kernels to the problem of recognizing collocations in local word contexts. We refer to (Giuliano et al., 2006) for a detailed description of the syntagmatic kernel. 252"]},{"title":"4 Lexical Entailment for Ontology Population","paragraphs":["In this section, we apply the IBLE technique, described in Section 3, to recognize lexical entailment for ontology population. To this aim, we cast ontology population as a lexical entailment task, where the fine-grained categories are the candidate entailed words, and the named entities to be subcategorized are the entailing words. Below, we present the main steps of our algorithm in details. Step 1 By using a state-of-the-art supervised NER system, we recognize the named entities belonging to a set of coarse-grained categories (e.g., location and people) of interest for the domain. Step 2 For all fine-grained categories belonging to the same coarse-grained type, we extract from a domain corpus all the occurrences of their lexicaliza-tions in context (e.g., for the category actor, we extract all contexts where the term actor occurs), and use them as input to train the IBLE classifier. In this way, we obtain a multi-class classifier for each ontological type. Then, we classify all the occurrences of the named entities recognized in the first step. The output of this process is a list of tagged named entities; where the elements of the list could have been classified into different fine-grained categories even though they refer to the same phrase (e.g., the occurrences of the entity “Jack London” could have been classified both as writer and actor, depending on the contexts where they occur). Step 3 A distinct category is finally assigned to the entities referring to the same phrase in the list. This is done on the basis of the tags that have been assigned to all its occurrences during the previous step. To this purpose, we implemented a voting mechanism. The basic idea is that an entity belongs to a specific category if its occurrences entail a particular superclass “more often than expected by chance”, where the expectation is modeled on the basis of the overall distribution of fine-grained category labels, assigned during the second step, in the corpus. This intuition is formalized by applying a statistical reliability measure, that depends on the distribution of positive assignments for each class, defined by the following formula: R(e, c) =","P (c|e) − μc σc , (2) where P (c|e) is estimated by the relative frequency of the fine-grained class c among the different occurrences of the entity e, μc and σc measure the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution P (c|E), and E is an (unlabeled) training set of instances of the coarse-grained type classified by the IBLE algorithm. Finally, each entity is assigned to the category c∗","such that","c∗ = argmax","c R(e, c).

Therefore, we performed a task driven evaluation of our system, measuring its usefulness in an ontology population task, for which evaluation benchmarks are available, allowing us to compare our technique to existing state-of-the-art approaches.","As introduced in Section 4, the ontology population task can be modeled as a lexical entailment problem, in which the fine-grained classes are the entailed words and the named entities belonging to the coarse-grained ontological type are the entailing words.","In the following, we first introduce the experimental settings (Section 5.1). Then we evaluate our technique by comparing it to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches for ontology population (Section 5.2). 5.1 Experimental Settings For all experiments, we adopted the evaluation benchmark proposed in (Tanev and Magnini, 2006). It considers two high-level named entity categories both having five fine-grained sub-classes (i.e., mountain, lake, river, city, and country as subtypes of LOCATION; statesman, writer, athlete, actor, and inventor are subtypes of PERSON). The authors used WordNet and Wikipedia as primary data sources for populating the evaluation ontology. In total, the ontology is populated with 280 instances which were not ambiguous (with respect to the ontology) and appeared at least twice in 253 the English CLEF corpus6",". Even the evaluation task is rather small and can be perceived as an artificial experimental setting, it is the best available benchmark we can use to compare our system to existing approaches in the literature, as we are not aware of other available resources.","To perform NER we used CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001). We trained a first-order CRF on the MUC data set to annotate locations and people. In our experiments, we used the implementation provided in MALLET (McCallum, 2002). We used a standard feature set inspired by the literature on text chunking and NER (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) to train a first-order CRFs. Each instance is represented by encoding all the following families of features, all time-shifted by - 2,-1,0,1,2: (a) the word itself, (b) the PoS tag of the token, (c) orthographic predicates, such as capitalization, upper-case, numeric, single character, and punctuation, (d) gazetteers of locations, people names and organizations, (e) character-n-gram predicates for 2 ⩽ n ⩽ 3.","As an (unsupervised) training set for the fine-grained categories, we exploited all occurrences in context of their corresponding terms we found in the CLEF corpus (e.g., for the category actor we used all the occurrences of the term actor). We did not use any prior estimation of the class frequency, adopting a pure unsupervised approach. Table 2 lists the fine-grained concepts and the number of the training examples found for each of them in the CLEF corpus.","As a reference for a comparison of the outcomes of this study, we used the results presented in (Tanev and Magnini, 2006) for the Class-Word and Class-Example approaches. The Class-Word approach exploits a similarity metric between terms and concepts based on the comparison of the contexts where they appear. Details of this technique can be found in (Cimiano and Völker, 2005). Tanev and Magnini (2006) proposed a variant of the Class-Word algorithm, called Class-Example, that relies on syntactic features extracted from corpus and uses as an additional input a set of training examples for each class.
