However, build-ing and maintaining high-quality gazetteers is very time consuming. Many methods have been proposed for solving this problem by automatically extracting gazetteers from large amounts of texts (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Shinzato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006). However, these methods require complicated induction of patterns or statistical methods to extract high-quality gazetteers.","We have recently seen a rapid and successful growth of Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org), which is an open, collaborative encyclopedia on the Web. Wikipedia has now more than 1,700,000 articles on the English version (March 2007) and the number is still increasing. Since Wikipedia aims to be an encyclopedia, most articles are about named entities and they are more structured than raw texts. Although it cannot be used as gazetteers directly since it is not intended as a machine readable resource, extracting knowledge such as gazetteers from Wikipedia will be much easier than from raw texts or from usual Web texts because of its structure. It is also important that Wikipedia is up-dated every day and therefore new named entities are added constantly. We think that extracting knowledge from Wikipedia for natural language process-ing is one of the promising ways towards enabling large-scale, real-life applications. In fact, many studies that try to exploit Wikipedia as a knowledge source have recently emerged (Bunescu and Pasça, 2006; Toral and Muñoz, 2006; Ruiz-Casado et al., 2006; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Zesch et al., 2007).","As a first step towards such approach, we demonstrate in this paper that category labels extracted from the first sentence of a Wikipedia article, which can be thought of as the definition of the entity described in the article, are really useful to improve the accuracy of NER. For example, “Franz Fischler” has the article with the first sentence, “Franz Fischler (born September 23, 1946) is an Austrian politician.” We extract “politician” from this sentence as the category label for “Franz Fischler”. We use such category labels as well as matching information as features of a CRF-based NE tagger. In our experiments using the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset (Tjong et al., 2003), we demonstrate that we can improve performance by using the Wikipedia features by 1.58 points in F-measure from the baseline, and by 1.21 points from the model that only uses the gazetteers provided in the CoNLL 2003 dataset. Our final model incorporating all features achieved 88.02 in F-measure, which means a 3.03 point improvement over the baseline, which does not use any 698 gazetteer-type feature.","The studies most relevant to ours are Bunescu and Pasça (2006) and Toral and Muñoz (2006).","Bunescu and Pasça (2006) presented a method of disambiguating ambiguous entities exploiting internal links in Wikipedia as training examples. The difference however is that our method tries to use Wikipedia features for NER, not for disambiguation which assumes that entity regions are already found. They also did not focus on the first sentence of an article. Also, our method does not disambiguate ambiguous entities, since accurate disambiguation is difficult and possibly introduces noise. There are two popular ways for presenting ambiguous entities in Wikipedia. The first is to redirect users to a disambiguation page, and the second is to redirect users to one of the articles. We only focused on the second case and did not utilize disambiguation pages in this study. This method is simple but works well because the article presented in the second case represents in many cases the major meaning of the ambiguous entities and therefore that meaning frequently appears in a corpus.","Toral and Muñoz (2006) tried to extract gazetteers from Wikipedia by focusing on the first sentences. However, their way of using the first sentence is slightly different. We focus on the first noun phrase after be in the first sentence, while they used all the nouns in the sentence. By using these nouns and WordNet, they tried to map Wikipedia entities to abstract categories (e.g., LOC, PER ORG, MISC) used in usual NER datasets. We on the other hand use the obtained category labels directly as features, since we think the mapping performed automatically by a CRF model is more precise than the mapping by heuristic methods. Finally, they did not demonstrate the usefulness of the extracted gazetteers in actual NER systems.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first explain the structure of Wikipedia in Section 2. Next, we introduce our method of extracting and using category labels in Section 3. We then show the experimental results on the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset in Section 4. Finally, we discuss the possibility of further improvement and future work in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Wikipedia 2.1 Basic structure","paragraphs":["An article in Wikipedia is identified by a unique name, which can be obtained by concatenating the words in the article title with underscore “ ”. For example, the unique name for the article, “David Beckham”, is David Beckham. We call these unique names “entity names” in this paper.","Wikipedia articles have many useful structures for knowledge extraction such as headings, lists, internal links, categories, and tables. These are marked up by using the Wikipedia syntax in source files, which authors edit. See the Wikipedia entry identified by How to edit a page for the details of the markup language.","We describe two important structures, redirections and disabiguation pages, in the following sections. 2.2 Redirection Some entity names in Wikipedia do not have a substantive article and are only redirected to an article with another entity name. This mechanism is called “redirection”. Redirections are marked up as “#REDIRECT [[A B C]]” in source files, where “[[...]]” is a syntax for a link to another article in Wikipedia (internal links). If the source file has such a description, users are automatically redirected to the article specified by the entity name in the brackes (A B C for the above example). Redirections are used for several purposes regarding ambiguity. For example, they are used for spelling resolution such as from “Apples” to “Apple” and abbreviation resolution such as from “MIT” to “Massachusetts In-stitute of Technology”. They are also used in the context of more difficult disambiguations described in the next section. 2.3 Disambiguation pages Some authors make a “disambiguation” page for an ambiguous entity name.1","A disambiguation page typically enumerates possible articles for that name. For example, the page for “Beckham” enumerates “David Beckham (English footballer)”, “Victoria","1","We mean by “ambiguous” the case where a name can be used to refer to several difference entities (i.e., articles in Wikipedia). 699 Beckham (English celebrity and wife of David)”, “Brice Beckham (American actor)”, and so on. Most, but not all, disambiguation pages have a name like Beckham (disambiguation) and are sometimes used with redirection. For example, Beckham is redirected to Beckham (disambiguation) in the above example. However, it is also possible that Beckham redirects to one of the articles (e.g, David Beckham). As we mentioned, we did not utilize the disambiguation pages and relied on the above case in this study. 2.4 Data Snapshots of the entire contents of Wikipedia are provided in XML format for each language version. We used the English version at the point of February 2007, which includes 4,030,604 pages.2","We imported the data into a text search engine3","and used it for the research."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe our method of extracting category labels from Wikipedia and how to use those labels in a CRF-based NER model. 3.1 Generating search candidates Our purpose here is to find the corresponding entity in Wikipedia for each word sequence in a sentence. For example, given the sentence, “Rare Jimi Hendrix song draft sells for almost $17,000”, we would like to know that “Jimi Hendrix” is described in Wikipedia and extract the category label, “musician”, from the article. However, considering all possible word sequences is costly. We thus restricted the candidates to be searched to the word sequences of no more than eight words that start with a word containing at least one capitalized letter.4 3.2 Finding category labels We converted a candidate word sequence to a Wikipedia entity name by concatenating the words with underscore. For example, a word sequence 2","The number of article pages is 2,954,255 including redirection pages 3","We used HyperEstraier available at http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/index.html 4","Words such as “It” and “He” are not considered as capitalized words here (we made a small list of stop words). “Jimi Hendrix” is converted to Jimi Hendrix. Next, we retrieved the article corresponding to the entity name.5","If the page for the entity name is a redirection page, we followed redirection until we find a non-redirection page.","Although there is no strict formatting rule in Wikipedia, the convention is to start an article with a short sentence defining the entity the article describes. For example, the article for Jimi Hendrix starts with the sentence, “Jimi Hendrix (November 27, 1942, Seattle, Washington - September 18, 1970, London, England) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter.” Most of the time, the head noun of the noun phrase just after be is a good category label. We thus tried to extract such head nouns from the articles.","First, we eliminated unnecessary markup such as italics, bold face, and internal links from the article. We also converted the markup for internal links like [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] to Hendrix, since the part after |, if it exists, represents the form to be displayed in the page. We also eliminated template markup, which is enclosed by {{ and }}, because template markup sometimes comes at the beginning of the article and makes the extraction of the first sentence impossible. 6","We then divided the article into lines according to the new line code, \\n, <br> HTML tags, and a very simple sentence segmentation rule for period (.). Next, we removed lines that match regular expression /\\̂s*:/ to eliminate the lines such as: This article is about the tree and its fruit. For the consumer electronics corporation, see Apple Inc. These sentences are not the content of the article but often placed at the beginning of an article. Fortunately, they are usually marked up using :, which is for indentation.","After the preprocessing described above, we extracted the first line in the remaining lines as the first sentence from which we extract a category label.","5","There are pages for other than usual articles in the Wikipedia data. They are distinguished by a namespace at-tribute. To retrieve articles, we only searched in namespace 0, which is for usual articles.","6","Templates are used for example to generate profile tables for persons. 700 We then performed POS tagging and phrase chunk-ing. TagChunk (Daumé III and Marcu, 2005)7","was used as a POS/chunk tagger. Next, we extracted the first noun phrase after the first “is”, “was”, “are”, or “were” in the sentence. Basically, we extracted the last word in the noun phrase as the category label. However, we used the second noun phrase when the first noun phrase ended with “one”, “kind”, “sort”, or “type”, or it ended with “name” followed by “of”. These rules were for treating examples like: Jazz is [a kind]NP [of]PP [music]NP characterized by swung and blue notes. In these cases, we would like to extract the head noun of the noun phrase after “of” (e.g., “music” in instead of “kind” for the above example). However, we would like to extract “name” itself when the sentence was like “Ichiro is a Japanese given name”.","We did not utilize Wikipedia’s “Category” sections in this study, since a Wikipedia article can have more than one category, and many of them are not clean hypernyms of the entity as far as we observed. We will need to select an appropriate category from the listed categories in order to utilize the Category section. We left this task for future research. 3.3 Using category labels as features If we could find the category label for the candidate word sequence, we annotated it using IOB2 tags in the same way as we represent named entities. In IOB2 tagging, we use “B- X”, “I- X”, and “O” tags, where “B”, “I”, and “O” means the beginning of an entity, the inside of an entity, and the outside of entities respectively. Suffix X represents the category of an entity.8","In this case, we used the extracted category label as the suffix. For example, if we found that “Jimi Hendrix” was in Wikipedia and extracted “guitarist” as the category label, we annotated the sentence, “Rare Jimi Hendrix song draft sells for almost $17,000”, as: RareO JimiB-guitarist HendrixI-guitarist songO draftO forO almostO $17,000O .O Note that we adopted the leftmost longest match if there were several possible matchings. These IOB2 tags were used in the same way as other features 7","http://www.cs.utah.edu/h̃al/TagChunk/ 8","We use bare “B”, “I”, and “O” tags if we want to represent only the matching information. in our NE tagger using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001). For example, we used a feature such as “the Wikipedia tag is B-guitarist and the NE tag is B-PER”."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we demonstrate the usefulness of the extracted category labels for NER. 4.1 Data and setting We used the English dataset of the CoNLL 2003 shared task (Tjong et al., 2003). It is a corpus of English newspaper articles, where four entity categories, PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC are annotated. It consists of training, development, and testing sets (14,987, 3,466, and 3,684 sentences, respectively). We concatenated the sentences in the same document according to the document boundary markers provided in the dataset.9","This generated 964 documents for the training set, 216 documents for the development set, and 231 documents for the testing set. Although automatically assigned POS and chunk tags are also provided in the dataset, we used TagChunk (Daumé III and Marcu, 2005)10","to assign POS and chunk tags, since we observed that accuracy could be improved, presumably due to the quality of the tags.11","We used the features summarized in Table 1 as the baseline feature set.

We omitted the numbers for gaz c, since they are same as gaz m. We can see that Wikipedia had more matches than the gazetteer, and covers more named entities (more than 70% of the NEs in the training corpus). The overlap between the gazetteer matches and the Wikipedia matches was moderate as the last row indicates (5,664 out of 18,617 matches). This indicates that Wikipedia has many entities that are not listed in the gazetteer.","We then compared the baseline model (baseline), which uses the feature set in Table 1, with the following models to see the effect of the gazetteer features and the Wikipedia features.","(A): + gaz m This uses gaz m in addition to the features in baseline.","(B): + gaz m, gaz c This uses gaz m and gaz c in addition to the features in baseline.","(C): + wp m This uses wp m in addition to the features in baseline.","(D): + wp m, wp c This uses wp m and wp c in addition to the features in baseline.","(E): + gaz m, gaz c, wp m, wp c This uses gaz m, gaz c, wp m, and wp c in addition to the features in baseline.","(F): + gaz m, gaz c, wp m, wp c (word comb.) This model uses the combination of words (wl) and gaz m, gaz c, wp m, or wp c, in addition to the features of model (E). More specifically, these features are the node feature, wl0 × x0 × y0, the edge feature, wl0 × x0 × y−1 × y0, the bigram node feature, wl−1 × wl0 × x−1 × x0 × y0, and the bigram edge feature, wl−1 ×wl0 ×x−1 ×x0 ×y−1 ×y0, where x is one of gaz m, gaz c, wp m, and wp c. We tested this model because we thought these combination features could alleviate the problem by incorrectly extracted categories in some cases, if there is a characteristic correlation between words and incorrectly extracted categories.","Table 5 shows the performance of these models. The results for (A) and (C) indicate that the matching information alone does not improve accuracy. This is because entity regions can be identified fairly correctly if models are trained using a sufficient amount of training data. The category labels, on the other hand, are actually important for improvement as the results for (B) and (D) indicate. The gazetteer model, (B), improved F-measure by 1.47 points from the baseline. The Wikipedia model, (D), improved F-measure by 1.58 points from the baseline. The effect of the gazetteer feature, gaz c, and the Wikipedia features, wp c, did not differ much. However, it is notable that the Wikipedia feature, which is obtained by our very simple method, achieved such an improvement easily.","The results for model (E) show that we can improve accuracy further, by using the gazetteer features and the Wikipedia features together. Model (E) achieved 87.67 in F-measure, which is better than those of (B) and (D).

Figure 1 shows the result. As can be seen, the matching information had a slight positive effect when the size of training data was small. For example, it improved F-measure by 0.8 points from the baseline at 200 documents. However, the superiority of category labels over the matching information did not change. The effect of category labels became greater as the training size became smaller. Its effect compared with the matching information alone was 3.01 points at 200 documents, while 1.91 points at 964 documents (i.e., the whole training data). Table 6: Breakdown of improvements and errors.

There were 5,942 named entities in the development set. We assessed how the labeling for these entities changed between (B) and (E). Note that the labeling for 199 sentences out of total 3,466 sentences was changed. Table 6 shows the breakdown of the improvements and the errors. “ inc” in the table means that the model could not label the entity correctly, i.e., the model could not find the entity region at all, or it assigned an incorrect category to the entity. “ cor” means that the model could label the entity correctly. The column, “ inc → cor”, for example, has the numbers for the entities that were labeled incorrectly by (B) but labeled correctly by (E). We can see from the column, “num”, that the number of improvements by (E) exceeded the number of errors introduced by (E) (102 vs. 56). Table 6 also shows how the gazetteer feature, gaz c, and the Wikipedia feature, wp c, fired in each case. We mean that the gazetteer feature fired by using “ g”, and that the Wikipedia feature fired by using “ w”. “ ḡ” and “ w̄” mean that the feature did not fire. As is the case for other machine learning methods, it is difficult to find a clear reason for each improvement or error. However, we can see that the number of ḡ ∧ w exceeded those of other cases in the case of “ inc → cor”, meaning that the Wikipedia feature contributed the most.","Finally, we show an example of case inc → cor in Figure 2. We can see that “Gazzetta dello Sport” in the sentence was correctly labeled as an entity of “ORG” category by model (E), because the Wikipedia feature identified it as a newspaper entity.15","15","Note that the category label, “character”, for “Atalanta” in the sentence was not correct in this context, which is an example where disambiguation is required. The final recognition was correct in this case presumably because of the information from gaz c feature. 705 O O O O B-LOC Sentence No. 584 UEFA came down heavily on Belgian club Standard Liege on Friday for \" disgraceful behaviour \" in an Intertoto final match against Karlsruhe of Germany .

The results indicate that structures in Wikipedia are suited for knowledge extraction. However, the results also indicate that there is room for improvement, considering that the effects of gaz c and wp c were similar, while the matching rate was greater for wp c. An issue, which we should treat, is the disambiguation of ambiguous entities. Our method worked well although it was very simple, presumably because of the following reason. (1) If a retrieved page is a disambiguation page, we cannot extract a category label and critical noise is not introduced. (2) If a retrieved page is not a disambiguation page, it will be the page describ-ing the major meaning determined by the agreement of many authors. The extracted categories are useful for improving accuracy because the major meaning will be used frequently in the corpus. However, it is clear that disambiguation techniques are required to achieve further improvements. In addition, if Wikipedia grows at the current rate, it is possible that almost all entities become ambiguous and a retrieved page is a disambiguation page most of the time. We will need a method for finding the most suitable article from the articles listed in a disambiguation page.","An interesting point in our results is that Wikipedia category labels improved accuracy, although they were much more specific (more than 1,200 categories) than the four categories of the CoNLL 2003 dataset. The correlation between a Wikipedia category label and a category label of NER (e.g., “musician” to “PER”) was probably learned by a CRF tagger. However, the merit of using such specific Wikipedia labels will be much greater when we aim at developing NER systems for more fine-grained NE categories such as proposed in Sekine et al. (2002) or Shinzato et al. (2006). We thus would like to investigate the effect of the Wikipedia feature for NER with such fine-grained categories as well. Disambiguation techniques will be important again in that case. Although the impact of ambiguity will be small as long as the target categories are abstract and an incorrectly extracted category is in the same abstract category as the correct one (e.g., extracting “footballer” instead of “cricketer”), such mis-categorization is critical if it is necessary to distinguish footballers from cricketers."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We tried to exploit Wikipedia as external knowledge to improve NER. We extracted a category label from the first sentence of a Wikipedia article and used it as a feature of a CRF-based NE tagger. The experiments using the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset demonstrated that category labels extracted by such a simple method really improved accuracy. However, disambiguation techniques will become more important as Wikipedia grows or if we aim at more fine-grained NER. We thus would like to incorporate a disambiguation technique into our method in future work. Exploiting Wikipedia structures such as disambiguation pages and link structures will be the key in that case as well."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S. J. Benson and J. J. Moré. 2001.
