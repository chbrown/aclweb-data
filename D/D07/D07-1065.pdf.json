This problem has only been investigated by a handful of researchers and yet it is important for a variety of applications, e.g., mapping parse trees to logical representations and structured representations for language modeling. For example, SuperARV language models (LMs) (Wang and Harper, 2002; Wang et al., 2003), which tightly integrate lexical features and syntactic constraints, have been found to significantly reduce word error in English speech recognition tasks. In order to generate SuperARV LM training, a state-of-the-art parser is used to parse training material and then a rule-based transformer converts the parses to the SuperARV representation. The transformer is quite accurate when operating on treebank parses; however, trees produced by the parser lack one important type of information – gaps, particularly WH-traces, which are important for more accurate extraction of the SuperARVs.","Approaches applied to the problem of empty node recovery fall into three categories. Dienes and Dubey (2003) recover empty nodes as a preprocessing step and pass strings with gaps to their parser. Their performance was comparable to (Johnson, 2002); however, they did not evaluate the impact of the gaps on parser performance. Collins (1999) directly incorporated wh-traces into his Model 3 parser, but he did not evaluate gap insertion accuracy directly. Most of the research belongs to the third category, i.e., post-processing of parser output. Johnson (2002) used corpus-induced patterns to insert gaps into both gold standard trees and parser output. Campbell (2004) developed a set of linguistically motivated hand-written rules for gap insertion. Machine learning methods were employed by (Higgins, 2003; Levy and Manning, 2004; Gabbard et al., 2006).","In this paper, we develop a probabilistic model that uses a set of patterns and tree matching to guide the insertion of WH-traces. We only insert traces of non-null WH-phrases, as they are most relevant for our goals. Our effort differs from the previous approaches in that we have developed an algorithm for the insertion of gaps that combines a small set of expressive patterns with a probabilistic grammar-based model. 620"]},{"title":"2 The Model","paragraphs":["We have developed a set of tree-matching patterns that are applied to propagate a gap down a path in a parse tree. Pattern examples appear in Figure 1. Each pattern is designed to match a subtree (a root and one or more levels below that root) and used to guide the propagation of the trace into one or more nodes at the terminal level of the pattern (indicated using directed edges). Since tree-matching patterns are applied in a top-down fashion, multiple patterns can match the same subtree and allow alternative ways to propagate a gap. Hence, we have developed a probabilistic model to select among the alternative paths. We have created 24 patterns for WHNP traces, 16 for WHADVP, 18 for WHPP, and 11 for WHADJP. Figure 1: Examples of tree-matching patterns Before describing our model, we first introduce","some notation.","• T N ij is a tree dominating the string of words between positions i and j with N being the label of the root. We assume there are no unary chains like N − X − ... −Y − N (which could be collapsed to a single node N ) in the tree, so that T N","ij uniquely describes the subtree. • A gap location g","ab,N","cd is represented as a tuple (gaptype, ancstr(a, b, N ), c, d), where gaptype is the type of the gap, (e.g., whnp for a WHNP trace), ancstr(a, b, N ) is the gap’s nearest ancestor, with a and b being its span and N being its label, and c and d indicating where the gap can be inserted. Note that a gap’s location is specified precisely when c = d. If the gap is yet to be inserted into its final location but will be inserted somewhere inside ancstr(a, b, N ), then we set c = a and d = b.","• ancstr(a, b, N ) in the tuple for gab,N","xy is the tree T N ab .","• p(gab,N","xy |gaptype, T N","ij ) is the probability that a gap of gaptype is located between x and y, with a and b being the span of its ancestor, and i ≤ a ≤ x ≤ y ≤ b ≤ j. Given this notation, our model is tasked to identify the best location for the gap in a parse tree among the alternatives, i.e., argmax x,a,b,N","P r(gab,N xx |T, gaptype) where gab,N","xx represents a gap location in a tree, and T = T N","ij is the subtree of the parse tree whose root node is the nearest ancestor node dominating the WH-phrase, excluding the WH-node itself, and gaptype is the type of the gap. In order to simplify the notation, we will omit the root labels N in T N","ij","and gab,N xy , implying that they match where appropriate.","To guide this model, we utilize tree-matching patterns (see Figure 1), which are formally defined as functions: ptrn : T × G → Γ ∪ {none} where T is the space of parse trees, G is the space of gap types, and Γ is the space of gaps gab","cd, and none is a special value representing failure to match1",". The application of a pattern is defined as: app(ptrn, τ, gaptype) = ptrn(τ, gaptype), where τ ∈ T and gaptype ∈ G. We define application of patterns as follows: app(ptrn, Tij, gaptype) → gab","xy : i ≤ a ≤ x < y ≤ b ≤ j app(ptrn, Tij, gaptype) → gab","xx : i ≤ a ≤ x ≤ b ≤ j app(ptrn, Tij, gaptype) → none Because patterns are uniquely associated with specific gap types, we will omit gaptype to simplify the notation. Application is a function defined for every pair (ptrn, Tij) with fixed gaptype. Patterns are applied to the root of Tij, not to an arbitrary subtree.","Consider an example of pattern application shown in Figure 2. The tree contains a relative clause such that the WHNP-phrase that was moved from some location inside the subtree of its sister node S. 2 viewers 3 will 4 tune 5 in 6 to 7 see 8","1","Modeling conjunction requires an alternative definition for patterns: ptrn : T × G → P owerset(Γ) ∪ {none}. For the sake of simplicity, we ignore conjunctions in the following discussion, except for in the few places where it matters, since this has little impact on the development of our model. 621 Figure 2: A pattern application example Now suppose there is a pattern P1 that matches the tree T28 indicating that the gap is somewhere in its subtree T38 (will tune in to see), i.e., app(P1, T28) → g38","38.

The sequence of patterns P1, P2, P5 proposes an alternative grammatically plausible location for the gap, as shown in Figure 3. Notice that the combination of the two sequences produces a tree of patterns, as shown in Figure 4, and this pattern tree covers much of the structure of the T28 subtree. 2.1 Tree Classes The number of unique subtrees that contain WH-phrases is essentially infinite; hence, modeling them directly is infeasible.

The pseudocode for this function called FindPCs appears in Figure 52",". When applied to Tij, this function returns the set of all pattern chains, applications of which would result in concrete gap locations. The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate as long as trees are of finite depth and each pattern moves the gap location down at least one level in the tree at each iteration. Using this function, we define Tree Class (T C) of a tree Tij as T C(Tij) = FindPCs(Tij).","2","list ◦ element means “append element to list”. 622","function FindPCs’(Tij, P C, allP Cs) {","Mij ← {P | P ∈ Π ∧ app(P, Tij) ̸= none}","forall P ∈ Mij gab xy ← app(P, Tij) P C ← P C ◦ P","M","ij if x = y then // gab","xy is a concrete location","allP Cs ← allP Cs ∪ {P C ◦ $} else","allP Cs ← FindPCs’(Tab, P C, allP Cs) return allP Cs }","function FindPCs(Tij) { return FindPCs’(Tij, [ ], ∅) } Figure 5: Pseudocode for FindPCs","In the case of a conjunction, the function FindPCs is slightly more complex. Recall that in this case app(P, Tij) produces a set of gaps or none. The pseudocode for this case appears in Figure 6. 2.2 A Gap Automaton The set of pattern chains constructed by the function FindPCs can be represented as a pattern tree with patterns being the edges. For example, the pattern tree in Figure 4 corresponds to the tree displayed in Figures 2 and 3.","This pattern tree captures the history of gap propagations beginning at A. Assuming at that point only pattern P1 is applicable, subtree B is produced. If P2 yields subtree C, and at that point patterns P3 and P5 can be applied, this yields subtree D and exact location F (which is expressed by the termination symbol $), respectively. Finally, pattern P4 matches subtree D and proposes exact gap location E. It is important to note that this pattern tree can be thought of as an automaton, with A, B, C, D, E, and F being the states and the pattern applications being the transitions.","Now, let us assign meaning of the states A, B, C, and D to be the set of matching patterns, i.e., A = {P1}, B = {P 2}, C = {P3, P5}, D = {P4}, and E = F = ∅. Given this representation, the pattern chains for the insertion of the gaps in our example would be as follows: ({P1}) P 1 → ({P2}) P 2 → ({P3, P5}) P 3 → ({P4}) P 4,$ −→ (∅) ({P1}) P 1 → ({P2}) P 2 → ({P3, P5}) P 5,$ −→ (∅)","With this representation, we can create a regular grammar using patterns as the terminals and their","function CrossProd(P C1, P C2) {","prod ← ∅","forall pci ∈ P C1 forall pcj ∈ P C2 : prod ← prod∪{pci ◦pcj}","return prod }","function FindPCs(Tij) {","Mij ← {P | P ∈ Π ∧ app(P, Tij) ̸= none}","newP Cs ← ∅","forall P ∈ Mij P Cs ← {[ ]} forall gab","xy ∈ app(P, Tij)","if x = y then","forall pc ∈ P Cs : pc ← pc ◦ $","else","P Cs ← CrossProd(P Cs,FindPCs(Tab)) forall pc ∈ P Cs : pc ← P","M","ij ◦ pc newP Cs ← newP Cs ∪ P Cs","return newP Cs }","The set app(P, Tij) must be ordered, so that branches of conjunction are concatenated in a well defined order.

However, for our example the chain of patterns applied P1, P2, P3, P4, $ could generate a pattern tree that is incompatible with the original tree. For example: ({P1}) P 1 → ({P2}) P 2 → ({P3, P5}) P 3 → ({P3, P4}) P 4,$ −→ (∅) which might correspond to something like “that viewers will tune in to expect to see.” Note that this pattern chain belongs to a different tree class, which incidentally would have inserted the gap at a different location (VP see gap).","To overcome this problem we add additional constraints to the grammar to ensure that all parses the grammar generates belong to the same tree class. One way to do this is to include the start state of a transition as an element of the terminal, e.g., P2","{P2} ,","P3 {P3,P5} .

For such a grammar, the question “what is the probability of a parse tree given a string and grammar” doesn’t make sense; however, the question “what is the probability of a string given the grammar” is still valid, and this is essentially what we require to develop a generative model for gap insertion. 2.3 The Pattern Grammar Let us define the pattern grammar more rigorously. Let Π be the set of patterns, and Π̃ ⊂ Π be the set of terminal patterns3",". Let pset(P ) be the set of all subsets of patterns which include the pattern P , i.e., pset(P ) = {ν ∪ {P } | ν ∈ powerset(Π)} • Let T = { P","pset(P ) | P ∈ Π} ⋃","{$} be the set of","terminals, where $ is a special symbol4",".","• Let N = {S} ⋃","powerset(Π) be the set of non-","terminals with S being the start symbol.","• Let P be the set of productions, defined as the","union of the following sets:","1. {S → ν | ν ∈ powerset(Π)}.","2. {ν → P","ν μ | P ∈ Π− Π̃ , ν ∈ pset(P ) and μ ∈ powerset(Π)}.

This rule models conjunction with n branches. 2.4 Our Gap Model Given the grammar defined in the previous subsec-tion, we will define a probabilistic model for gap insertion. Recall that our goal is to find:","argmax x,a,b","P r(gab xx|T )","Just like the probability of a sentence is obtained by","summing up the probabilities of its parses, the prob-","ability of the gap being at gab","xx is the sum of proba-","bilities of all pattern chains that yield gab","xx. 3 Patterns that generate exact position for a gap. 4 Symbol $ helps to separate branches in strings with con-","junction.","P r(gab xx|T ) = ∑ pci∈Υ P r(pci|T )","where Υ = {pc | app(pc, T ) = gab xx}. Note that pci ∈ T C(T ) by definition.","For our model, we use two approximations. First, we collapse a tree T into its Tree Class T C(T ), effectively ignoring details irrelevant to gap insertion: P r(pci|T ) ≈ P r(pci|T C(T )) Figure 7: A pattern tree with the pattern chain ABDGM marked using bold lines","Consider the pattern tree shown in Figure 7. The probability of the pattern chain ABDGM given the pattern tree can be computed as: P r(ABDGM|T C(T )) =","P r(ABDGM, T C(T )) P r(T C(T )) =","NR(ABDGM, T C(T )) NR(T C(T )) where NR(T C(T )) is the number of occurrences of the tree class T C(T ) in the training corpus and NR(ABDGM, T C(T )) is the number cases when the pattern chain ABDGM leads to a correct gap in trees corresponding to the tree class T C(T ). For many tree classes, NR(T C(T )) may be a small number or even zero, thus this direct approach can-not be applied to the estimation of P r(pci|T C(T )). Further approximation is required to tackle the sparsity issue.","In the following discussion, XY will denote an edge (pattern) between vertices X and Y in 624 the pattern tree shown in Figure 7. Note that P r(ABDGM |T C(T )) can be represented as: P r(AB|T C(T ), A) × P r(BD|T C(T ), AB)× ×P r(DG|T C(T ), ABD) × P r(GM|T C(T ), ABDG) We make an independence assumption, specifically, that P r(BD|T C(T ), AB) depends only on states B, D, and the edge between them, not on the whole pattern tree or the edges above B, i.e., P r(BD|T C(T ), AB) ≈ P r(BD, D|B). Note that this probability is equivalent to the probability of a production P r(B","BD","→ D) of a PCFG.","Recall that the meaning assigned to a state in pattern grammar in Section 2.2 is the set of patterns matching at that state. Thus, accord-ing to that semantics, only the edges displayed bold in Figure 8 are involved in computation of P r(B","BD","→ D). Written in the style we used for","our grammar, the production is {BD, BE, BF } → BD","{BD,BE,BF } {DG, DH}. Figure 8: The context considered for estimation of the probability of transition from B to D","Pattern trees are fairly shallow (partly because many patterns cover several layers in a parse tree as can be seen in Figures 1 and 2); therefore, the context associated with a production covers a good part of a pattern tree. Another important observa-tion is that the local configuration of a node, which is described by the set of matching patterns, is the most relevant to the decision of where the gap is to be propagated5",". This is the reason why the states are represented this way.","Formally, the second approximation we make is","5","We have evaluated a model that only uses P r(BD|{BD, BE, BF }) for the probability of taking BD and found it performs only slightly worse than the model presented here. as follows: P r(pci|T C(T )) ≈ P r(pci|G) where G is a PCFG model based on the grammar described above. P r(pci|G) = ∏ prodj∈P(pci) P r(prodj|G) where P(pci) is the parse of the pattern chain pci which is a string of terminals of G. Combining the formulae:","P r(gab xx|T ) ≈ ∑ pci∈Υ P r(pci|G) Finally, since P r(T C(T )|G) is a constant for T ,","argmax x,a,b","P r(gab xx|T ) ≈ argmax","x,a,b ∑ pci∈Υ P r(pci|G)","To handle conjunction, we must express the fact that pattern chains yield sets of gaps.

The remaining equations are unaffected. 2.5 Smoothing Even for the relatively small number of patterns, the number of non-terminals in the grammar can potentially be large (2|Π|","). This does not happen in practice since most patterns are mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, productions, unseen in the training data, do occur and their probabilities have to be estimated. Rewriting the probability of a transition P r(A → a","A B) as P(A, a, B), we use the following in-terpolation:","P̃(A, a, B) = λ1P(A, a, B) + λ2P(A, a) +λ3P(A, B) + λ4P(a, B) + λ5P(a) We estimate the parameters on the held out data (section 24 of WSJ) using a hill-climbing algorithm. 625"]},{"title":"3 Evaluation 3.1 Setup","paragraphs":["We compare our algorithm under a variety of conditions to the work of (Johnson, 2002) and (Gabbard et al., 2006). We selected these two approaches because of their availability6",". In addition, (Gabbard et al., 2006) provides state-of-the-art results. Since we only model the insertion of WH-traces, all metrics include co-indexation with the correct WH phrases identified by their type and word span.","We evaluate on three metrics. The first metric, which was introduced by Johnson (2002), has been widely reported by researchers investigating gap insertion. A gap is scored as correct only when it has the correct type and string position. The metric has the shortcoming that it does not require correct attachment into the tree.","The second metric, which was developed by Campbell (2004), scores a gap as correct only when it has the correct gap type and its mother node has the correct nonterminal label and word span. As Campbell points out, this metric does not restrict the position of the gap among its siblings, which in most cases is desirable; however, in some cases (e.g., double object constructions), it does not correctly detect errors in object order. This metric is also adversely affected by incorrect attachments of optional constituents, such as PPs, due to the span requirement.","To overcome the latter issue with Campbell’s metric, we propose to use a third metric that evaluates gaps with respect to correctness of their lexical head, type of the mother node, and the type of the coindexed wh-phrase. This metric differs from that used by Levy and Manning (2004) in that it counts only the dependencies involving gaps, and so it represents performance of the gap insertion algorithm more directly.","We evaluate gap insertion on gold trees from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank (WSJ) and parse trees automatically produced using the Charniak (2000) and Bikel (2004) parsers.

However, we believe that the dependency metric is more appropriate for evaluation on automatically parsed trees because it enforces the most important aspects of tree structure for evaluating gap insertion. The relatively poor performance of Johnson’s and our algorithms on WHPP gaps compared that on WHADVP gaps is probably due, at least in part, to the significantly smaller number of WHPP gaps in the training corpus and the relatively wider range of possible attachment sites for the prepositional phrases.","Table 2 displays how well the algorithms trained on WSJ perform on BN. A large number of the errors are due to FRAGs which are far more common in the speech corpus than in WSJ. WHPP and WHADJP, although more rare than the other types, are presented for reference. 3.3 Error Analysis It is clear from the contrast between the results based on gold standard trees and the automatically produced parses in Table 1 that parse error is a major source of error. Parse error impacts all of the metrics, but the patterns of errors are different. For WHNPs, Campbell’s metric is lower than the other two across all three algorithms, suggesting that this metric is adversely affected by factors that do not impact the other metrics (most likely the span of the gap’s mother node). For WHADVPs, the metrics show a similar degradation due to parse error across the board. We are reluctant to draw conclusions for the metrics on WHPPs; however, it should be noted that the position of the PP should be less critical for evaluating these gaps than their correct attachment, suggesting that the head dependency metric would more accurately reflect the performance of the system for these gaps.","Campbell’s metric has an interesting property: in parse trees, we can compute the upper bound on recall by simply checking whether the correct WH-phrase and gap’s mother node exist in the parse tree. We present recall results and upper bounds in Table 3. Clearly the algorithms are performing close to the upper bound for WHNPs when we take into account the impact of parse errors on this metric. Clearly there is room for improvement for the WHPPs.

PTB annotation guidelines leave it to annotators to decide whether the gap should be attached at the conjunction level or inside its branches (Bies et al., 1995) leading to inconsistency in attachment decisions for adverbial gaps.","• Lack of coverage: Even though the patterns we use are very expressive, due to their small number some rare cases are left uncovered.","• Model errors: Sometimes despite one of the applicable pattern chains proposes the correct gap, the probabilistic model chooses otherwise. We believe that a lexicalized model can eliminate most of these errors."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["The main contribution of this paper is the development of a generative probabilistic model for gap insertion that operates on subtree structures. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating results very close to the upper bound on WHNP using Campbell’s metric. Performance for WHADVPs and especially WHPPs, however, has room for improvement. We believe that lexicalizing the model by adding","information about lexical heads of the gaps may re-","solve some of the errors. For example:","(SBAR (WHADVP-3 (WRB when)) (S (NP (NNP Congress))","(VP (VBD wanted)","(S (VP (TO to)","(VP (VB know) ...)))","(ADVP (-NONE- *T*-3)))))","(SBAR (WHADVP-1 (WRB when))","(S (NP (PRP it))","(VP (AUX is) (VP (VBN expected)","(S (VP (TO to)","(VP (VB deliver) ...","(ADVP (-NONE- *T*-1))))))))) These sentences have very similar structure, with two potential places to insert gaps (ignoring reordering with siblings). The current model inserts the gaps as follows: when Congress (VP wanted (S to know) gap) and when it is (VP expected (S to deliver) gap), making an error in the second case (partly due to the bias towards shorter pattern chains, typical for a PCFG). However, deliver is more likely to take a temporal modifier than know.","In future work, we will investigate methods for adding lexical information to our model in order to improve the performance on WHADVPs and WH-PPs. In addition, we will investigate methods for automatically inferring patterns from a treebank corpus to support fast porting of our approach to other languages with treebanks."]},{"title":"5 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Ryan Gabbard for provid-ing us output from his algorithm for evaluation.
