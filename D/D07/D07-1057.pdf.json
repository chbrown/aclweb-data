It is an important task in discourse analysis, and successful coreference resolution benefitsmany natural language processing applications such as information extraction, question answering, etc.","In the literature, much of the work on coreference resolution is for English text (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al., 2003; McCallum and Wellner, 2005). Publicly available corpora for coreference resolution are mostly in English, e.g., the Message Understanding Conference tasks (MUC6 and MUC7)1",". Relatively less work has 1 http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_","projects/muc/ been done on coreference resolution for Chinese. Recently, the ACE Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) task2","included annotated Chinese corpora for coreference resolution. Florian et al. (2004) and Zhou et al. (2005) reported research on Chinese coreference resolution.","A prominent phenomenon in Chinese coreference resolution is the prevalence of zero pronouns. A zero pronoun (ZP) is a gap in a sentence which refers to an entity that supplies the necessary information for interpreting the gap. An anaphoric zero pronoun (AZP) is a zero pronoun that corefers to one or more overt noun phrases present in the preceding text. Zero pronouns occur much more frequently in Chinese compared to English, and pose a unique challenge in coreference resolution for Chinese. For example, Kim (2000) conducted a study to compare the use of overt subjects in English, Chinese, and other languages. He found that the use of overt subjects in English is over 96%, while this percentage is only 64% for Chinese, indicating that zero pronouns (lack of overt subjects) are much more prevalent in Chinese.","Chinese zero pronouns have been studied in linguistics research (Li and Thompson, 1979; Li, 2004), but only a small body of prior work in computational linguistics deals with Chinese zero pronoun identification and resolution (Yeh and Chen, 2004; Converse, 2006). To our knowledge, all previous research on zero pronoun identification and resolution in Chinese uses hand-engineered rules or heuristics, and our present work is the first to perform both identification and resolution of Chinese","2","http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ 541 anaphoric zero pronouns using a machine learning approach.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the task definition, and describe the corpus used in our evaluation and the evaluation metrics. We then give an overview of our approach in Section 3. Anaphoric zero pronoun identification and resolution are presented in Section 4 and 5, respectively. We present the experimental results in Section 6 and related work in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8."]},{"title":"2 Task Definition 2.1 Zero Pronouns","paragraphs":["As mentioned in the introduction, a zero pronoun (ZP) is a gap in a sentence which refers to an entity that supplies the necessary information for interpreting the gap. A coreferential zero pronoun is a zero pronoun that corefers to one or more overt noun phrases present in the same text.","Just like a coreferential noun phrase, a coreferential zero pronoun can also corefer to a noun phrase in the preceding or following text, called anaphoric or cataphoric, respectively. Most coreferential zero pronouns in Chinese are anaphoric. In the corpus used in our evaluation, 98% of the coreferential zero pronouns have antecedents. Hence, for simplicity, we only consider anaphoric zero pronouns (AZP) in this work. That is, we only attempt to resolve a coreferential zero pronoun to noun phrases preceding it.","Here is an example of an anaphoric zero pronoun from the Penn Chinese TreeBank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) (sentence ID=300): [¥) æ= [China electronic products import and export 4]1 ̇φ2 trade]1 continues increasing , φ2 3 æ= { represents total import and export ’s › ratio continues increasing .","The anaphoric zero pronoun φ2 is coreferring to noun phrase 1. The corresponding parse tree is shown in Figure 1. In CTB, IP refers to a simple clause that does not have complementizers. CP, on the other hand, refers to a clause introduced by a complementizer.","Resolving an anaphoric zero pronoun to its correct antecedent in Chinese is a difficult task. Although gender and number information is available for an overt pronoun and has proven to be useful in pronoun resolution in prior research, a zero pronoun in Chinese, unlike an overt pronoun, provides no such gender or number information. At the same time, identifying zero pronouns in Chinese is also a difficult task. There are only a few overt pronouns in English, Chinese, and many other languages, and state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers can successfully recognize most of these overt pronouns. However, zero pronouns in Chinese, which are not explicitly marked in a text, are hard to be identified. Furthermore, even if a gap is a zero pronoun, it may not be coreferential. All these difficulties make the identification and resolution of anaphoric zero pronouns in Chinese a challenging task. 2.2 Corpus We use an annotated third-person pronoun and zero pronoun coreference corpus from Converse (2006)3",". The corpus contains 205 texts from CTB 3.0, with annotations done directly on the parse trees. In the corpus, coreferential zero pronouns, third-person pronouns, and noun phrases are annotated as coreference chains. If a noun phrase is not in any coreference chain, it is not annotated. If a coreference chain does not contain any third-person pronoun or zero pronoun, the whole chain is not annotated.","A zero pronoun is not always coreferential with some noun phrases. In the corpus, if a zero pronoun is not coreferential with any overt noun phrases, it is assigned one of the following six categories: discourse deictic (#DD), existential (#EXT), inferrable (#INFR), ambiguity between possible referents in the text (#AMB), arbitrary reference (#ARB), and unknown (#UNK). For example, in the following sentence, φ3 refers to an event in the preceding text, with no corresponding antecedent noun phrase. So no antecedent is annotated, and φ3 is labeled as #DD. &‹ ̋cL T Hong Kong famous syndicate Cheung Kong 3 The data set we obtained is a subset of the one used in Con-","verse (2006). 542 IP1                   IP2         NP1       NP2 NR ¥) NP3  NN  NN  NP4  NN æ= NN 4 VP1  VV  VP2 VV  PU ̇ IP3    ","NP5   CP1","CP2   IP4","VP3  VV 3 NP6 ","ADJP JJ  NP7 NN æ= DEC { NP8 NN › VP4  VV  VP5 VV  PU  Figure 1: The parse tree which corresponds to the anaphoric zero pronoun example in Section 2.1. \" - * 4Qu Holdings , Peregrine as strategic =V .

She applied the Hobbs algorithm (Hobbs, 1978) to resolve antecedents for the given AZPs.","In our case, we are only interested in zero pronouns with explicit noun phrase referents. If a coreference chain does not contain AZPs, we discard the chain. We also discard the 6 occurrences of zero pronouns with split antecedents, i.e., a zero pronoun with an antecedent that is split into two separate noun phrases. A total of 383 AZPs remain in the data set used in our experiments.","Among the 205 texts in the data set, texts 1–155 are reserved for training, while the remaining texts (156–205) are used for blind test. The statistics of the data set are shown in Table 1.","Training Test Doc ID 1–155 156–205 # Docs 155 50","# Characters 96,338 15,710 # Words 55,348 9,183 # ZPs 665 87 # AZPs 343 40 Table 1: Statistics of training and test data sets. 2.3 Evaluation Metrics As in previous work on pronoun resolution, we evaluate the accuracy in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure. The overall recall and precision on the test set are computed by micro-averaging over all test in-stances. The overall F-measure is then computed.","For AZP identification, recall and precision are 543 definedas: RecallAZP = # AZP Hit # AZP in Key P recisionAZP =","# AZP Hit # AZP in Response An “AZP Hit” occurs when an AZP as reported in the response (system output) has a counterpart in the same position in the gold standard answer key.","For AZP resolution, recall and precision are definedas: RecallResol = # Resol Hit # AZP in Key P recisionResol =","# Resol Hit # AZP in Response A “Resol Hit” occurs when an AZP is correctly identified, and it is correctly resolved to a noun phrase that is in the same coreference chain as provided in the answer key."]},{"title":"3 Overview of Our Approach","paragraphs":["In this section, we give an overview of our approach for Chinese AZP identificationand resolution.","Typically, the input raw texts need to be processed by a Chinese word segmenter, a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and a parser sequentially. Although our approach can apply directly to machine-generated parse trees from raw text, in order to minimize errors introduced by preprocessing, and focus mainly on Chinese zero pronoun resolution, we use the gold standard word segmentation, POS tags, and parse trees provided by CTB. However, we remove all null categories and functional tags from the CTB gold standard parse trees. Figure 1 shows a parse tree after such removal.","A set of zero pronoun candidates and a set of noun phrase candidates are then extracted. If W is the leftmost word in the word sequence that is spanned by some VP node, the gap G that is immediately to the left of W qualifies as a ZP candidate. For example, in Figure 1, gaps immediately to the left of the two occurrences of , and , 3, are all ZP candidates. All noun phrases4","that are either maximal NPs or modifier NPs qualify as NP candidates.","4","A noun phrase can either be NP or QP in CTB. We simply use NP hereafter. For example, in Figure 1, NP1, NP2, NP3, NP5, and NP6 are all NP candidates. With these ZP and NP candidate extractions, the recalls of ZPs and NPs are 100% and 98.6%, respectively.","After the ZP and NP candidates are determined, we perform AZP identification and resolution in a sequential manner. We build two classifiers, the AZP identificationclassifierand the AZP resolution classifier. The AZP identification classifier determines the position of AZPs, while the AZP resolution classifier finds an antecedent noun phrase for each AZP identified by the AZP identification classifier. Both classifiersare built using machine learning techniques. The features of both classifiers are largely syntactic features based on parse trees and are easily computed.","We perform 5-fold cross validation on the training data set to tune parameters and to pick the best model. We then retrain the best model with all data in the training data set, and apply it to the blind test set. In the following sections, all accuracies reported on the training data set are based on 5-fold cross validation."]},{"title":"4 Anaphoric Zero Pronoun Identification","paragraphs":["We use machine learning techniques to build the AZP identification classifier.

If Z is the first gap of the sentence, Wl, P , Pl, and Pr are all NA. Furthermore, let V be the highest VP node in the parse tree that is immediately to the right of Z, i.e., the leftmost word in the word sequence that is spanned by V is Wr. If Z is not the firstgap in the sentence, define the ceiling node C to be P , otherwise to be the root node of the parse tree.

Whether a training example is positive or negative depends on whether the ZP candidate is an AZP.","After generating all training examples, we train an AZP identification classifier using the J48 decision tree learning algorithm in Weka5",". During testing, each ZP candidate is presented to the learned classifierto determine whether it is an AZP. We conduct experiments to measure the performance of the model learned.

T has no left sibling, or its left sibling is not an NP node, then the gap that is immediately to the left of the word sequence spanned by T is an AZP. This simple AZP identification heuristic achieves an F-measure of 26.1%. Imbalanced Training Data","From Table 3, one can see that the F-measure of the machine-learned AZP identification model is 28.6%, which is only slightly higher than baseline heuristic model. It has a relatively high precision, but much lower recall. The problem lies in the highly imbalanced number of positive and negative training examples. Among all the 155 texts in the training set, there are 343 positive and 10,098 negative training examples. The ratio r of the number 545 of negative training examples to the number of positive training examples is 29.4. A classifier trained on such highly imbalanced training examples tends to predict more testing examples as negative examples. This explains why the precision is high, but the recall is low.","To overcome this problem, we vary r by varying the weight of the positive training examples, which is equivalent to sampling more positive training examples. The values of r that we have tried are 1, 2, 3, . . . , 29. The larger the value of r, the higher the precision, and the lower the recall. By tuning r, we get a balance between precision and recall, and hence an optimal F-measure. Figure 2 shows the effect of tuning r on AZP identification.

Noun phrases provide much fruitful information for anaphoricity identification. However, useful information such as gender, number, lexical string, etc, is not available in the case of zero pronouns. This makes AZP identification a much more difficulttask, and hence it has a relatively low accuracy."]},{"title":"5 Anaphoric Zero Pronoun Resolution","paragraphs":["In anaphoric zero pronoun resolution, we also use machine learning techniques to build a classifier. The features are described in Table 4.","In the feature description, Z is the anaphoric zero pronoun that is under consideration, and A is the potential NP antecedent for Z. V is the same as in AZP identification. The feature values of the pair NP1 and φ2 (the gap immediately to the left of 3) in Figure 1 are shown in Table 4.","To train the AZP resolution classifier, we generate training examples in the following way. An AZP Z and its immediately preceding coreferential NP antecedent A in the gold standard coreference chain form a positive training example. Between A and Z, there are other NP candidates. Each one of these NP candidates, together with Z, form a negative training example. This is similar to the approach adopted in Soon et al. (2001). We also train the AZP resolution classifier using the J48 decision tree learning algorithm.","After building both AZP identificationand resolution classifiers, we perform AZP identification and resolution in a sequential manner. For a ZP candidate Z, the AZP identification classifier determines whether Z is an AZP. If it is an AZP, all NP candidates that are to the left of Z in textual order are considered as potential antecedents. These potential antecedents are tested from right to left. We start from the NP candidate A1 that is immediately to the left of Z. A1 and Z form a pair. If the pair is classifiedas positive by the resolution classifier, A1 is the antecedent for Z. If it is classified as negative, we proceed to the NP candidate A2 that is immediately to the left of A1, and test again. The process continues until we findan antecedent for Z, or there is no more NP candidate to test.","This right-to-left search attempts to findthe closest correct antecedent for an AZP. We do not choose the best-first search strategy proposed by Ng and Cardie (2002b). This is because we generate training examples and build the resolution classifier by pairing each zero pronoun with its closest preceding antecedent. In addition, a zero pronoun is typically not too far away from its antecedent. In our data set, 92.6% of the AZPs have antecedents that are at most 2 sentences apart. Our experiment shows that this closest-first strategy performs better than the best-firststrategy for Chinese AZP resolution.","Table 5 shows the experimental results of 5-fold cross validation on the training data set.
