They are particularly appealing for tasks in which there is an abundance of language data available, but manual annotation of this data is very resource-intensive. Unsupervised clustering can eliminate the need for (full) manual annotation of the data into desired classes, but often at the cost of making evaluation of success more difficult.","External evaluation measures for clustering can be applied when class labels for each data point in some evaluation set can be determined a priori. The clustering task is then to assign these data points to any number of clusters such that each cluster contains all and only those data points that are members of the same class Given the ground truth class labels, it is trivial to determine whether this perfect clustering has been achieved. However, evaluating how far from perfect an incorrect clustering solution is a more difficult task (Oakes, 1998) and proposed approaches often lack rigor (Meila, 2007).","In this paper, we describe a new entropy-based external cluster evaluation measure, V-MEASURE1",", designed to address the problem of quantifying such imperfection. Like all external measures, V-measure compares a target clustering — e.g., a manually annotated representative subset of the available data — against an automatically generated clustering to determine now similar the two are. We introduce two complementary concepts, completeness and homogeneity, to capture desirable properties in clustering tasks.","In Section 2, we describe V-measure and how it is calculated in terms of homogeneity and completeness. We describe several popular external cluster evaluation measures and draw some comparisons to V-measure in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss how some desirable properties for clustering are satisfied by V-measure vs. other measures. In Section 5, we present two applications of V-measure, on document clustering and on pitch accent type clustering."]},{"title":"2 V-Measure and Its Calculation","paragraphs":["V-measure is an entropy-based measure which explicitly measures how successfully the criteria of homogeneity and completeness have been satisfied. V-measure is computed as the harmonic mean of distinct homogeneity and completeness scores, just as","1","The ‘V’ stands for “validity”, a common term used to describe the goodness of a clustering solution. 410 precision and recall are commonly combined into F-measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979). As F-measure scores can be weighted, V-measure can be weighted to favor the contributions of homogeneity or completeness.","For the purposes of the following discussion, as-sume a data set comprising N data points, and two partitions of these: a set of classes, C = {ci|i = 1, . . . , n} and a set of clusters, K = {ki|1, . . . , m}. Let A be the contingency table produced by the clustering algorithm representing the clustering solution, such that A = {aij } where aij is the number of data points that are members of class ci and elements of cluster kj .","To discuss cluster evaluation measures we introduce two criteria for a clustering solution: homogeneity and completeness. A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class. A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster. The homogenity and completeness of a clustering solution run roughly in opposi-tion: Increasing the homogeneity of a clustering solution often results in decreasing its completeness. Consider, two degenerate clustering solutions. In one, assigning every datapoint into a single cluster, guarantees perfect completeness — all of the data points that are members of the same class are trivially elements of the same cluster. However, this cluster is as unhomogeneous as possible, since all classes are included in this single cluster. In another solution, assigning each data point to a distinct cluster guarantees perfect homogeneity — each cluster trivially contains only members of a single class. However, in terms of completeness, this solution scores very poorly, unless indeed each class contains only a single member. We define the distance from a perfect clustering is measured as the weighted harmonic mean of measures of homogeneity and completeness.","Homogeneity:","In order to satisfy our homogeneity criteria, a clustering must assign only those datapoints that are members of a single class to a single cluster. That is, the class distribution within each cluster should be skewed to a single class, that is, zero entropy. We determine how close a given clustering is to this ideal by examining the conditional entropy of the class distribution given the proposed clustering. In the perfectly homogeneous case, this value, H(C|K), is 0. However, in an imperfect situation, the size of this value, in bits, is dependent on the size of the dataset and the distribution of class sizes. Therefore, instead of taking the raw conditional entropy, we normalize this value by the maximum reduction in entropy the clustering information could provide, specifically, H(C).","Note that H(C|K) is maximal (and equals H(C)) when the clustering provides no new information — the class distribution within each cluster is equal to the overall class distribiution. H(C|K) is 0 when each cluster contains only members of a single class, a perfectly homogenous clustering. In the degenerate case where H(C) = 0, when there is only a single class, we define homogeneity to be 1. For a perfectly homogenous solution, this normalization, H(C|K) H(C) , equals 0. Thus, to adhere to the convention of 1 being desirable and 0 undesirable, we define homogeneity as: h = { 1 if H(C, K) = 0 1 − H(C|K) H(C) else (1) where H(C|K) = − |K| ∑ k=1 |C| ∑ c=1 ack N log ack","∑|C| c=1 ack H(C) = − |C| ∑ c=1","∑|K| k=1 ack n log","∑|K| k=1 ack n Completeness:","Completeness is symmetrical to homogeneity. In order to satisfy the completeness criteria, a clustering must assign all of those datapoints that are members of a single class to a single cluster. To evaluate completeness, we examine the distribution of cluster assignments within each class. In a perfectly complete clustering solution, each of these distributions will be completely skewed to a single cluster. We can evaluate this degree of skew by calculating the conditional entropy of the proposed cluster distribution given the class of the component datapoints, H(K|C). In the perfectly complete case, H(K|C) = 0. However, in the worst case scenario, 411 each class is represented by every cluster with a distribution equal to the distribution of cluster sizes, H(K|C) is maximal and equals H(K). Finally, in the degenerate case where H(K) = 0, when there is a single cluster, we define completeness to be 1. Therefore, symmetric to the calculation above, we define completeness as: c = { 1 if H(K, C) = 0 1 − H(K|C) H(K) else (2) where H(K|C) = − |C| ∑ c=1 |K| ∑ k=1 ack N log ack","∑|K| k=1 ack H(K) = − |K| ∑ k=1","∑|C| c=1 ack n log","∑|C| c=1 ack n","Based upon these calculations of homogeneity and completeness, we then calculate a clustering solution’s V-measure by computing the weighted harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness, Vβ =","(1+β)∗h∗c","(β∗h)+c . Similarly to the familiar F-measure, if β is greater than 1 completeness is weighted more strongly in the calculation, if β is less than 1, homogeneity is weighted more strongly.","Notice that the computations of homogeneity, completeness and V-measure are completely independent of the number of classes, the number of clusters, the size of the data set and the clustering algorithm used. Thus these measures can be applied to and compared across any clustering solution, regardless of the number of data points (n-invariance), the number of classes or the number of clusters. More-over, by calculating homogeneity and completeness separately, a more precise evaluation of the performance of the clustering can be obtained."]},{"title":"3 Existing Evaluation Measures","paragraphs":["Clustering algorithms divide an input data set into a number of partitions, or clusters. For tasks where some target partition can be defined for testing purposes, we define a “clustering solution” as a mapping from each data point to its cluster assignments in both the target and hypothesized clustering. In the context of this discussion, we will refer to the target partitions, or clusters, as CLASSES, referring only to hypothesized clusters as CLUSTERS. Two commonly used external measures for assessing clustering success are P urity and Entropy (Zhao and Karypis, 2001), defined as, P urity =","∑k r=1 1 n maxi(ni","r) Entropy =","∑k r=1 nr n (− 1","log q","∑q i=1 ni r nr log","ni","r","nr )","where q is the number of classes, k the number","of clusters, nr is the size of cluster r, and ni","r is the","number of data points in class i clustered in cluster","r.","Both these approaches represent plausable ways to evaluate the homogeneity of a clustering solution. However, our completeness criterion is not measured at all. That is, they do not address the ques-tion of whether all members of a given class are included in a single cluster. Therefore the P urity and Entropy measures are likely to improve (increased P urity, decreased Entropy) monotonically with the number of clusters in the result, up to a degenerate maximum where there are as many clusters as data points. However, clustering solutions rated high by either measure may still be far from ideal.","Another frequently used external clustering evaluation measure is commonly refered to as “clustering accuracy”. The calculation of this accuracy is inspired by the information retrieval metric of F-Measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979). The formula for this clustering F-measure as described in (Fung et al., 2003) is shown in Figure 3. Let N be the number of data points, C the set of classes, K the set of clusters and nij be the number of members of class ci ∈ C that are elements of cluster kj ∈ K. F (C, K) = X c i∈C |ci| N max k j∈K {F (ci, kj)} (3) F (ci, kj) = 2 ∗ R(ci, kj) ∗ P (ci, kj) R(ci, kj) + P (ci, kj) R(ci, kj) = nij |ci| P (ci, kj) = nij |kj| Figure 1: Calculation of clustering F-measure","This measure has a significant advantage over P urity and Entropy, in that it does measure both the homogeneity and the completeness of a clustering solution. Recall is calculated as the portion of items from class i that are present in cluster j, thus measuring how complete cluster j is with respect to class i. Similarly, Precision is calculated as the por-412 Solution A Solution B F-Measure=0.5 F-Measure=0.5 V-Measure=0.14 V-Measure=0.39 Solution C Solution D F-Measure=0.6 F-Measure=0.6 V-Measure=0.30 V-Measure=0.41 Figure 2: Examples of the Problem of Matching tion of cluster j that is a member of class i, thus measuring how homogenous cluster j is with respect to class i.","Like some other external cluster evaluation techniques (misclassification index (MI) (Zeng et al., 2002), H (Meila and Heckerman, 2001), L (Larsen and Aone, 1999), D (van Dongen, 2000), microaveraged precision and recall (Dhillon et al., 2003)), F-measure relies on a post-processing step in which each cluster is assigned to a class. These techniques share certain problems. First, they calculate the goodness not only of the given clustering solution, but also of the cluster-class matching. Therefore, in order for the goodness of two clustering solutions to be compared using one these measures, an identical post-processing algorithm must be used. This problem can be trivially addressed by fixing the class-cluster matching function and including it in the definition of the measure as in H. However, a second and more critical problem is the “problem of matching” (Meila, 2007). In calculating the similarity between a hypothesized clustering and a ‘true’ clustering, these measures only consider the contributions from those clusters that are matched to a target class. This is a major problem, as two significantly different clusterings can result in identical scores.","In figure 2, we present some illustrative examples of the problem of matching. For the purposes of this discussion we will be using F-Measure as the measure to describe the problem of matching, however, these problems affect any measure which requires a mapping from clusters to classes for evaluation.","In the figures, the shaded regions represent CLUS-TERS, the shapes represent CLASSES. In a perfect clustering, each shaded region would contain all and only the same shapes. The problem of matching can manifest itself either by not evaluating the entire membership of a cluster, or by not evaluating every cluster. The former situation is presented in the figures A and B in figure 2. The F-Measure of both of these clustering solutions in 0.6. (The precision and recall for each class is 3","5 .) That is, for each class, the best or “matched” cluster contains 3 of 5 elements of the class (Recall) and 3 of 5 elements of the cluster are members of the class (Precision). The make up of the clusters beyond the majority class is not evaluated by F-Measure. Solution B is a better clustering solution than solution A, in terms of both homogeneity (crudely, “each cluster contains fewer2 classes”) and completeness (“each class is contained in fewer clusters”). Indeed, the V-Measure of solution B (0.387) is greater than that of solution A (0.135). Solutions C and D represent a case in which not every cluster is considered in the evaluation of F-Measure. In this example, the F-Measure of both solutions is 0.5 (the harmonic mean of 3","5 and 3","7 ). The small “unmatched” clusters are not measured at all in the calculation of F-Measure. Solution D is a better clustering than solution C – there are no incorrect clusterings of different classes in the small clusters. V-Measure reflects this, solution C has a V-measure of 0.30 while the V-measure of solution D is 0.41.","A second class of clustering evaluation techniques is based on a combinatorial approach which examines the number of pairs of data points that are clustered similarly in the target and hypothesized clustering. That is, each pair of points can either be 1) clustered together in both clusterings (N11), 2) clustered separately in both clusterings (N00), 3) clustered together in the hypothesized but not the target clustering (N01) or 4) clustered together in the target but not in the hypothesized clustering (N10). Based on these 4 values, a number of measures have been proposed, including Rand Index (Rand, 1971),","2","Homogeneity is not measured by V-measure as a count of the number of classes contained by a cluster but “fewer” is an acceptable way to conceptualize this criterion for the purposes of these examples. 413 Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985), Γ statistic (Hubert and Schultz, 1976), Jaccard (Milligan et al., 1983), Fowlkes-Mallows (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983) and Mirkin (Mirkin, 1996). We illustrate this class of measures with the calculation of Rand Index. Rand(C, K) = N11+N00","n(n−1)/2 Rand Index can be interpreted as the probability that a pair of points is clustered similarly (together or separately) in C and K.","Meila (2007) describes a number of potential problems of this class of measures posed by (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983) and (Wallace, 1983). The most basic is that these measures tend not to vary over the interval of [0, 1]. Transformations like those applied by the adjusted Rand Index and a minor adjustment to the Mirkin measure (see Section 4) can address this problem. However, pair matching measures also suffer from distributional problems. The baseline for Fowlkes-Mallows varies significantly between 0.6 and 0 when the ratio of data points to clusters is greater than 3 — thus including nearly all real-world clustering problems. Similarly, the Adjusted Rand Index, as demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations in (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983), varies from 0.5 to 0.95. This variance in the measure’s baseline prompts Meila to ask if the assumption of linearity following normalization can be maintained. If the behavior of the measure is so unstable before normalization can users reasonably expect stable behavior following normalization?","A final class of cluster evaluation measures are based on information theory. These measures an-alyze the distribution of class and cluster membership in order to determine how successful a given clustering solution is or how different two partitions of a data set are. We have already examined one member of this class of measures, Entropy. From a coding theory perspective, Entropy is the weighted average of the code lengths of each cluster. Our V-measure is a member of this class of clustering measures. One significant advantage that information theoretic evaluation measures have is that they provide an elegant solution to the “problem of matching”. By examining the relative sizes of the classes and clusters being evaluated, these measures all evaluate the entire membership of each cluster — not just a ‘matched’ portion.","Dom’s Q0 measure (Dom, 2001) uses conditional entropy, H(C|K) to calculate the goodness of a clustering solution. That is, given the hypothesized partition, what is the number of bits necessary to represent the true clustering?","However, this term – like the P urity and Entropy measures – only evaluates the homogeneity of a solution. To measure the completeness of the hypothesized clustering, Dom includes a model cost term calculated using a coding theory argument. The overall clustering quality measure presented is the sum of the costs of representing the data (H(C|K)) and the model. The motivation for this approach is an appeal to parsimony: Given identical conditional entropies, H(C|K), the clustering solution with the fewest clusters should be preferred. Dom also presents a normalized version of this term, Q2, which has a range of (0, 1] with greater scores being representing more preferred clusterings. Q0(C, K) = H(C|K)+ 1 n |K| ∑ k=1 log (","h(k) + |C| − 1 |C| − 1 ) where C is the target partition, K is the hypothesized partition and h(k) is the size of cluster k. Q2(C, K) = 1 n","∑|C| c=1 log","(h(c)+|C|−1 |C|−1 ) Q0(C, K) We believe that V-measure provides two significant advantages over Q0 that make it a more useful diagnostic tool. First, Q0 does not explicitly calculate the degree of completeness of the clustering solution. The cost term captures some of this information, since a partition with fewer clusters is likely to be more complete than a clustering solution with more clusters. However, Q0 does not explicitly address the interaction between the conditional entropy and the cost of representing the model. While this is an application of the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1978; Rissanen, 1989), it does not provide an intuitive manner for assessing our two competing criteria of homogeneity and completeness. That is, at what point does an increase in conditional entropy (homogeneity) justify a reduction in the number of clusters (completeness).","Another information-based clustering measure is variation of information (V I) (Meila, 2007), V I(C, K) = H(C|K) + H(K|C). V I is presented 414 as a distance measure for comparing partitions (or clusterings) of the same data. It therefore does not distinguish between hypothesized and target clusterings. V I has a number of useful properties. First, it satisfies the metric axioms. This quality allows users to intuitively understand how V I values combine and relate to one another. Secondly, it is “convexly additive”. That is to say, if a cluster is split, the distance from the new cluster to the original is the distance induced by the split times the size of the cluster. This property guarantees that all changes to the metric are “local”: the impact of splitting or merging clusters is limited to only those clusters in-volved, and its size is relative to the size of these clusters. Third, VI is n-invariant: the number of data points in the cluster do not affect the value of the measure. V I depends on the relative sizes of the partitions of C and K, not on the number of points in these partitions. However, V I is bounded by the maximum number of clusters in C or K, k∗",". Without manual modification however, k∗","= n, where each cluster contains only a single data point. Thus, while technically n-invariant, the possible values of V I are heavily dependent on the number of data points being clustered. Thus, it is difficult to compare V I values across data sets and clustering algorithms without fixing k∗",", as V I will vary over different ranges. It is a trivial modification to modify V I such that it varies over [0,1]. Normalizing, V I by log n or 1/2 log k∗","guarantee this range. However, Meila (2007) raises two potential problems with this modification. The normalization should not be applied if data sets of different sizes are to be compared — it negates the n-invariance of the measure. Additionally, if two authors apply the latter normalization and do not use the same value for k∗",", their results will not be comparable.","While V I has a number of very useful distance properties when analyzing a single data set across a number of settings, it has limited utility as a general purpose clustering evaluation metric for use across disparate clusterings of disparate data sets. Our homogeneity (h) and completeness (c) terms both range over [0,1] and are completely n-invariant and k∗","-invariant. Furthermore, measuring each as a ratio of bit lengths has greater intuitive appeal than a more opportunistic normalization.","V-measure has another advantage as a clustering evaluation measure over V I and Q0. By evaluating homogeneity and completeness in a symmetrical, complementary manner, the calculation of V-measure makes their relationship clearly observable. Separate analyses of homogeneity and completeness are not possible with any other cluster evaluation measure. Moreover, by using the harmonic mean to combine homogeneity and completeness, V-measure is unique in that it can also prioritize one criterion over another, depending on the clustering task and goals."]},{"title":"4 Comparing Evaluation Measures","paragraphs":["Dom (2001) describes a parametric technique for generating example clustering solutions. He then proceeds to define five “desirable properties” that clustering accuracy measures should display, based on the parameters used to generate the clustering solution.

In most pitch accent languages, words can also be accented in different ways to convey different mean-ings (Hirschberg, 2002). In the ToBI labeling conventions for Standard American English (Silverman et al., 1992), for example, there are five different accent types (H*, L*, H+!H*, L+H*, L*+H).","We extracted a number of acoustic features from accented words within the read portion of the Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Nakatani et al., 1995) and examined how well clustering in these acoustic dimensions correlates to manually annotated pitch accent types.

We included in the feature vector the relative location of the maximum pitch value in the word as well as the distance between this max-","5","Pitch accents containing a high tone may also be downstepped, or spoken in a compressed pitch range. Here we collapsed all DOWNSTEPPED instances of each pitch accent with the corresponding non-downstepped instances. 417 imum and the point of maximum intensity. Finally, we calculated the raw and speaker normalized slope from the start of the word to the maximum pitch, and from the maximum pitch to the end of the word.","Using this feature vector, we performed k-means clustering and evaluate how successfully these dimensions represent differences between pitch accent types.

Q2 shows a maximum at k = 10, and descends at k increases. This is an artifact of the M DL principle. Q2 makes the claim that a clustering solution based on fewer clusters is preferable to one using more clusters, and that the balance between the number of clusters and the conditional entropy, H(C|K), should be measured in terms of coding length. With V-measure, we present a different argument. We contend that the a high value of k does not inherently reduce the goodness of a clustering solution. Using these results as an example, we find that at approximately 30 clusters an increase of clusters translates to an increase in V-Measure. This is due to an increased homogeneity ( H(C|K) H(C) ) and a relatively stable completeness (","H(K|C)","H(K) ). That is, inclusion of more clusters leads to clusters with a more skewed within-cluster distribution and a equivalent distribution of cluster memberships within classes. This is intuitively preferable – one criterion is improved, the other is not reduced – despite requiring additional clusters. This is an instance in which the MDL principle limits the usefulness of Q2. We again (see section 5.1) observe the close dependency of VI and k. Moreover, in considering figures 5 and 4, simultaneously, we see considerably higher values achieved by the document clustering experiments. Given the naı̈ve approaches taken in these experiments, this is expected – and even desired – given the previous work on these tasks: document clustering has been notably more successfully applied than pitch accent clustering. These examples allow us to observe how transparently V-measure can be used to compare the behavior across distinct data sets."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a new external cluster evaluation measure, V-measure, and compared it with existing clustering evaluation measures. V-measure is based upon two criteria for clustering usefulness, homogeneity and completeness, which capture a clustering solution’s success in including all and only datapoints from a given class in a given cluster. We have also demonstrated V-measure’s usefulness in comparing clustering success across different domains by evaluating document and pitch accent clustering solutions. We believe that V-measure addresses some of the problems that affect other cluster measures. 1) It evaluates a clustering solution independent of the clustering algorithm, size of the data set, number of classes and number of clusters. 2) It does not require its user to map each cluster to a class. Therefore, it only evaluates the quality of the clustering, not a post-hoc class-cluster mapping. 3) It evaluates the clustering of every data point, avoiding the “problem of matching”. 4) By evaluating the criteria of both homogeneity and completeness, V-measure is more comprehensive than those that evaluate only one. 5) Moreover, by evaluating these criteria separately and explicitly, V-measure can serve as an elegant diagnositic tool providing greater insight into clustering behavior."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors thank Kapil Thadani, Martin Jansche and Sasha Blair-Goldensohn and for their feedback.
