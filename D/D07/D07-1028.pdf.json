It is an important and growing field of natural language processing with applications in areas such as transfer-based machine translation (Riezler and Maxwell, 2006) and sentence condensation (Riezler et al., 2003). While recent work on generation in restricted domains, such as (Belz, 2007), has shown promising results there remains much room for improvement particularly for broad coverage and robust generators, like those of Nakanishi et al. (2005) and Cahill","∗","Now at the Institut für Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung, Universität Stuttgart, Azenbergstrae 12, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany. aoife.cahill@ims.uni-stuttgart.de and van Genabith (2006), which do not rely on hand-crafted grammars and thus can easily be ported to new languages.","This paper is concerned with sentence generation from Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) f-structures (Kaplan, 1995). We present improvements in previous LFG-based generation models firstly by breaking down PCFG independence assumptions so that more f-structure conditioning context is included when predicting grammar rule expansions. This history-based approach has worked well in parsing (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) and we show that it also improves PCFG-based generation.","We also present work on utilising named entities and other multi-word units to improve generation results for both accuracy and coverage. There has been a limited amount of exploration into the use of multi-word units in probabilistic parsing, for example in (Kaplan and King, 2003) (LFG parsing) and (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) (dependency parsing). We are not aware of any similar work on generation. In the LFG-based generation algorithm presented by Cahill and van Genabith (2006) complex named entities (i.e. those consisting of more than one word token) and other multi-word units can be fragmented in the surface realization. We show that the identificationof such units may be used as a simple measure to constrain the generation model’s output.","We take the generator of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006) as our baseline generator. When tested on f-structures for all sentences from Section 23 of the Penn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank (Mar-267 cus et al., 1993), the techniques described in this paper improve BLEU score from 66.52 to 68.82. In addition, coverage is increased from 98.18% to al-most 100% (99.96%).","The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review related work on statistical sentence generation. Section 3 describes the baseline generation model and in Section 4 we show how the new history-based model improves over the baseline. In Section 5 we describe the source of the multi-word units (MWU) used in our experiments and the various techniques we employ to make use of these MWUs in the generation process. Section 6 gives experimental details and results."]},{"title":"2 Related Work on Statistical Generation","paragraphs":["In (statistical) generators, sentences are generated from an abstract linguistic encoding via the application of grammar rules. These rules can be hand-crafted grammar rules, such as those of (Langkilde-Geary, 2002; Carroll and Oepen, 2005), created semi-automatically (Belz, 2007) or, alternatively, extracted fully automatically from treebanks (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Nakanishi et al., 2005; Cahill and van Genabith, 2006).","Insofar as it is a broad coverage generator, which has been trained and tested on sections of the WSJ corpus, our generator is closer to the generators of (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002; Nakanishi et al., 2005) than to those designed for more restricted domains such as weather forecast (Belz, 2007) and air travel domains (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).","Another feature which characterises statistical generators is the probability model used to select the most probable sentence from among the space of all possible sentences licensed by the grammar. One generation technique is to first generate all possible sentences, storing them in a word lattice (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) or, alternatively, a generation for-est, a packed represention of alternate trees proposed by the generator (Langkilde, 2000), and then select the most probable sequence of words via an n-gram language model.","Increasingly syntax-based information is being incorporated directly into the generation model. For example, Carroll and Oepen (2005) describe a sentence realisation process which uses a hand-crafted HPSG grammar to generate a generation forest. A selective unpacking algorithm allows the extraction of an n-best list of realisations where realisation ranking is based on a maximum entropy model. This unpacking algorithm is used in (Velldal and Oepen, 2005) to rank realisations with features definedover HPSG derivation trees. They achieved the best results when combining the tree-based model with an n-gram language model.","Nakanishi et al. (2005) describe a treebank-extracted HPSG-based chart generator. Importing techniques developed for HPSG parsing, they apply a log linear model to a packed representation of all alternative derivation trees for a given input. They found that a model which included syntactic information outperformed a bigram model as well as a combination of bigram and syntax model.","The probability model described in this paper also incorporates syntactic information, however, unlike the discriminative HPSG models just described, it is a generative history- and PCFG-based model. While Belz (2007) and Humphreys et al. (2001) mention the use of contextual features for the rules in their generation models, they do not provide details nor do they provide a formal probability model. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper providing a probabilistic generative, history-based generation model."]},{"title":"3 Surface Realisation from f-Structures","paragraphs":["Cahill and van Genabith (2006) present a probabilistic surface generation model for LFG (Kaplan, 1995). LFG is a constraint-based theory of grammar, which analyses strings in terms of c(onstituency)-structure and f(unctional)-structure (Figure 1). C-structure is definedin terms of CFGs, and f-structures are recursive attribute-value matrices which represent abstract syntactic functions (such as SUBJect, OBJect, OBLique, COMPlement (sentential), ADJ(N)unct), agreement, control, longdistance dependencies and some semantic information (e.g. tense, aspect).","C-structures and f-structures are related in a projection architecture in terms of a piecewise correspondence φ.1","The correspondence is indicated in 1 Our formalisation follows (Kaplan, 1995). 268 S ↑=↓","NP VP (↑ SUBJ)= ↓ ↑=↓ NNP V NP ↑=↓ ↑=↓ (↑ OBJ)= ↓ Susan contacted PRP","(↑ PRED) = ‘Susan’ (↑ PRED) = ‘contact’ ↑=↓","(↑ NUM) = SG (↑ TENSE) = past","(↑ PERS) = 3 her","(↑ PRED) = ‘pro’","(↑ NUM) = SG","(↑ PERS) = 3 f 1:       PRED ‘CONTACT⟨(↑SUBJ)(↑OBJ)⟩’","SUBJ f 2: [ PRED ‘SUSAN’ NUM SG PERS 3 ]","OBJ f 2: [ PRED ‘PRO’ NUM SG PERS 3 ] TENSE PAST       Figure 1: C- and f-structures with φ links for the sentence Susan contacted her. terms of the curvy arrows pointing from c-structure nodes to f-structure components in Figure 1.

However, there is a sense in which the proposed cure improves on the symptoms, but not the cause of the problem: it weakens independence assumptions by multiplying and hence increasing the specificity of conditioning CFG category labels. There is another option available to us, and that is the option we will explore in this paper: instead of applying a generation grammar transform, we will improve the f-structure-based conditioning of the generation rule probabilities. In the original model, rules are conditioned on purely local f-structure context: the set of features/attributes φ-linked to the LHS of a grammar rule. As a direct consequence of this, the conditioning (and hence the model) can-not not distinguish between NP, PRP and NNP rules 270 appropriate to e.g. subject (SUBJ) or object contexts (OBJ) in a given input f-structure. However, the required information can easily be incorporated into the generation model by uniformly conditioning generation rules on their parent (mother) grammatical function, in addition to the local φ-linked feature set. This additional conditioning has the effect of making the choice of generation rules sensitive to the history of the generation process, and, we argue, provides a simpler, more uniform, general, intuitive and natural probabilistic generation model obviating the need for CFG-grammar transforms in the original proposal of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006).","In the new model, each generation rule is now conditioned on the LHS rule CFG category, the set of features φ-linked to LHS and the parent grammatical function of the f-structure φ-linked to LHS. In a given c-/f-structure pair, for a CFG node n, the parent grammatical function of the f-structure φ-linked to n is that grammatical function GF, which, if we take the f-structure φ-linked to the mother M(n), and apply it to GF, returns the f-structure φ-linked to n: (φ(M(n))GF) = φ(n).","The basic idea is best explained by way of an example. Consider again Figure 1. The mother grammatical function of the f-structure f2 associated with node NP(↑SUBJ=↓) and its daughter NNP(↑=↓) (via the ↑=↓ functional annotation) is SUBJ, as (φ(M(n2))SUBJ) = φ(n2), or equivalently (f1SUBJ) = f2.","Given Figures 1 and 2 as training set, the improved model learns the generation rules (the mother grammatical function of the outermost f-structure is assumed to be a dummy TOP grammatical function) of Tables 6 and 7.

Given the input f-structure in Figure 3, the model will generate the correct string she accepted. In addition, uniform conditioning on mother grammatical function is more general than the case-phenomena specific generation grammar transform of (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006), in that it applies to each and every sub-part of a recursive input f-structure driving generation, making available relevant generation history (context) to guide local generation decisions.","The new history-based probabilistic generation model is definedas: P (T ree| F-Str) := ∏","X → Y in T ree","F eats = { ai|∃ vj(φ(X))ai = vj} (φ(M(X)))GF = φ(X) P (X → Y | X, F eats, GF) (3)","Note that the new conditioning feature, the f-structure mother grammatical function, GF, is available from structure previously generated in the c-structure tree. As such, it is part of the history of the tree, i.e. it has already been generated in the top-down derivation of the tree. In this way, the generation model resembles history-based models for parsing (Black et al., 1992; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000). Unlike, say, the parent annotation for parsing of (Johnson, 1998) the parent GF feature for a particular node expansion is not merely extracted from the parent node in the c-structure tree, but is sometimes extracted from an ancestor node further up the c-structure tree via intervening ↑=↓ functional annotations.","Section 6 provides evaluation results for the new model on section 23 of the Penn treebank."]},{"title":"5 Multi-Word Units","paragraphs":["In another effort to improve generator accuracy over the baseline model we explored the use of multi-word units in generation. We expect that the identificationof MWUs may be useful in imposing word-order constraints and reducing the complexity of the generation task.

If multi-word units were either treated as one token throughout the generation process, or, alternatively, if a constraint were imposed on the generator such that multi-word units were always generated in the correct order, then this should help improve generation accuracy. In Section 5.1 we describe the various techniques that were used to incorporate multi-word units into the generation process and in 5.2 we detail the different types and sources of multi-word unit used in the experiments. Section 6 provides evaluation results on test and development sets from the WSJ treebank.","5.1 Incorporating MWUs into the Generation Process We carried out three types of experiment which, in different ways, enabled the generation process to respect the restrictions on word-order provided by multi-word units. For the first experiments (type 1), the WSJ treebank training and test data were altered so that multi-word units are concatenated into single words (for example, New York becomes New York). As in (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006) f-structures are generated from the (now altered) treebank and from this data, along with the treebank trees, the PCFG-based grammar, which is used for training the generation model, is extracted. Similarly, the f-structures for the test and development sets are created from Penn Treebank trees which have been modified so that multi-word units form single units. The leftmost and middle f-structures in Figure 5 show an example of an original f-structure format and a named-entity chunked format, respectively. Strings output by the generator are then postprocessed so that the concatenated word sequences are converted back into single words.","In the second experiment (type 2) only the test data was altered with no concatenation of MWUs carried out on the training data.","In the final experiments (type 3), instead of concatenating named entities, a constraint is introduced to the generation algorithm which penalises the generation of sequences of words which violate the internal word order of named entities. The input is marked-up in such a way that, although named entities are no longer chunked together to form single words, the algorithm can read which items are part of named entities. See the rightmost f-structure in Figure 5 for an example of an f-structure marked-up in this way. The tag NE1 1, for example, indicates that the sub-f-structure is part of a named identity with id number 1 and that the item corresponds to the first word of the named entity. The baseline generation algorithm, following Kay (1996)’s work on chart generation, already contains the hard constraint that when combining two chart edges they must cover disjoint sets of words. We added an additional constraint which prevents edges from being combined if this would result in the generation of a string which contained a named entity which was 272 either incomplete or where the words in the named entity were generated in the wrong order. 5.2 Types of MWUs used in Experiments We carry out experiments with multi-word units from three different sources. First, we use the output of the maximum entropy-based named entity recognition system of (Chieu and Ng, 2003). This system identifies four types of named entity: person, organisation, location, and miscellaneous. Additionally we use a dictionary of candidate multi-word expressions based on a list from the Stanford Multiword Expression Project4",". Finally, we also carry out experiments with multi-word units extracted from the BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type Corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005). This supplements the Penn WSJ treebank’s one million words of syntax-annotated Wall Street Journal text with additional annotations of 23 named entity types, including nominal-type named entities such as person, or-ganisation, location, etc. as well as numeric types such as date, time, quantity and money. Since the BBN corpus data is very comprehensive and is hand-annotated we take this be be a gold standard, representing an upper bound for any gains that might be made by identifying complex named entities in our experiments.5","Table 8 gives examples of the various types of MWUs identifiedby the three sources.","For our purposes we are not concerned with the distinctions between different types of named entities; we are merely exploiting the fact that they may be treated as atomic units in the generation model. In all cases we disregard multi-word units that cross the original syntactic bracketing of the WSJ treebank. An overview of the various types of multi-word units used in our experiments is presented in Table 9."]},{"title":"6 Experimental Evaluation","paragraphs":["All experiments were carried out on the WSJ treebank with sections 02-21 for training, section 24 for development and section 23 for finaltest results.

The final row in Table 10, MWU BBN, shows the best results with BBN MWUs: the history-based model with BBN multi-word units incorporated in a type 1 experiment.","We now discuss the various MWU experiments in more detail. See Table 11 for a breakdown of the MWU experiment results on the development set, WSJ section 24. Our baseline for these experiments is the history-based generator presented in Section 4. For each experiment type described in Section 5.1 we ran three experiments, varying the source of MWUs. First, MWUs came from the automatic NE recogniser of (Chieu and Ng, 2003), then we added the MWUs from the Stanford list and finally we ran tests with MWUs extracted from the BBN corpus.","Our first set of experiments (type 1), where both training data and development set data were MWU-chunked, produced the worst results for the automatically chunked MWUs. BLEU score accuracy actually decreased for the automatically chunked MWU experiments. In an error analysis of type 1 experiments with (Chieu and Ng, 2003) concatenated MWUs, we inspected those sentences where accuracy had decreased from the baseline. We found that for over half (51.5%) of these sentences, the input f-structures contained no multi-word units at all. The problem for these sentences therefore lay with the probabilistic grammar extracted from the MWU-chunked training data. When the source of MWU for the type 1 experiments was the BBN, however, accuracy improved significantly over the baseline and the result is the highest accuracy achieved over all experiment types. One possible reason for the low accuracy scores in the type 1 experiments with the (Chieu and Ng, 2003) MWU chunked data could be noisy MWUs which negatively affect the grammar. For example, the named entity recogniser of (Chieu and Ng, 2003) achieves an accuracy of 88.3% on section 23 of the Penn Treebank.","In order to avoid changing the grammar through concatenation of MWU components (as in experiment type 1) and thus risking side-effects which cause some heretofore likely constructions become less likely and vice versa, we ran the next set of experiments (type 2) which leave the original grammar intact and alter the input f-structures only. These experiments were more successful overall and we achieved an improvement over the baseline for both BLEU and String Edit Distance scores with all MWU types. As can be seen from Table 11 the best score for automatically chunked MWUs are with the (Chieu and Ng, 2003) MWUs. Accuracy decreases marginally when we added the Stanford MWUs. In our final set of experiments (type 3) although the accuracy for all three types of MWUs improves over the baseline, accuracy is a little below the type 2 experiments.","It is difficultto compare sentence generators since the information contained in the input varies greatly between systems, systems are evaluated on different test sets and coverage also varies considerably. In order to compare our system with those of (Nakanishi et al., 2005) and (Langkilde-Geary, 2002) we report our best results with automatically acquired MWUs for sentences of ≤ 20 words in length on section 23: our system gets coverage of 100% and a BLEU score of 71.39. For the same test set Nakanishi et al. (2005) achieved coverage of 90.75 and a BLEU score of 77.33.

Langkilde-Geary (2002) report results for experiments with varying levels of linguistic detail in the input given to the generator. As with Nakanishi et al. (2005) we findthe ‘permute,no dir’ type of input is most comparable to the level of information contained in our input f-structures. Finally, the symbolic generator of Callaway (2003) reports a Simple String Accuracy score of 88.84 and coverage of 98.7% on section 23 for all sentence lengths."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have presented techniques which improve the accuracy of an already state-of-art surface generation model. We found that a history-based model that increases conditioning context in PCFG style rules by simply including the grammatical function of the f-structure parent, improves generator accuracy. In the future we will experiment with increasing conditioning context further and using more sophisticated smoothing techniques to avoid sparse data problems when conditioning is increased.","We have also demonstrated that automatically acquired multi-word units can bring about moderate, but significant,improvements in generator accuracy. For automatically acquired MWUs, we found that this could best be achieved by concatenating input items when generating the f-structure input to the generator, while training the input generation grammar on the original (i.e. non-MWU concatenated) sections of the treebank. Relying on the BBN corpus as a source of multi-word units, we gave an upper bound to the potential usefulness of multi-word units in generation and showed that automatically acquired multi-word units, encouragingly, give results not far below the upper bound."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Srinivas Bangalore and Owen Rambow. 2000.
