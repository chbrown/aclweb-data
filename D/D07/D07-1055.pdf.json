Here, the main focus is on the training problem. We will compare a variety of training criteria for statistical machine translation. In particular, we are considering criteria for the log-linear parameters or model scaling factors. We will introduce new training criteria based on maximum likelihood estimation and expected loss computation. We will show that some achieve significantly better results than the standard minimum error rate training of (Och, 2003).","Additionally, we will compare two decision rules, the common maximum a-posteriori (MAP) decision rule and the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decision rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). We will show that the minimum Bayes risk decision rule results in better translation quality than the maximum a-posteriori decision rule for several training criteria.","The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows: first, we will describe related work in Sec. 2. Then, we will briefly review the baseline system, Bayes decision rule for statistical machine translation and automatic evaluation metrics for machine translation in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, respectively. The novel training criteria are described in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6. Experimental results are reported in Sec. 7 and conclusions are given in Sec. 8."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The most common modeling approach in statistical machine translation is to use a log-linear combination of several sub-models (Och and Ney, 2002). In (Och and Ney, 2002), the log-linear weights were tuned to maximize the mutual information criterion (MMI). The current state-of-the-art is to optimize these parameters with respect to the final evaluation criterion; this is the so-called minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).","Minimum Bayes risk decoding for machine trans-524 lation was introduced in (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). It was shown that MBR outperforms MAP decoding for different evaluation criteria. Further experiments using MBR for Bleu were performed in (Venugopal et al., 2005; Ehling et al., 2007). Here, we will present additional evidence that MBR decoding is preferable over MAP decoding.","Tillmann and Zhang (2006) describe a perceptron style algorithm for training millions of features. Here, we focus on the comparison of different training criteria.","Shen et al. (2004) compared different algorithms for tuning the log-linear weights in a reranking framework and achieved results comparable to the standard minimum error rate training.","An annealed minimum risk approach is presented in (Smith and Eisner, 2006) which outperforms both maximum likelihood and minimum error rate training. The parameters are estimated iteratively using an annealing technique that minimizes the risk of an expected-BLEU approximation, which is similar to the one presented in this paper."]},{"title":"3 Baseline System","paragraphs":["In statistical machine translation, we are given a source language sentence f J","1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ , which is to be translated into a target language sentence eI","1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Statistical decision the-ory tells us that among all possible target language sentences, we should choose the sentence which minimizes the expected loss, also called Bayes risk:","êÎ","1 = argmin","I,eI","1 { ∑ I′ ,e′I′","1","P r(e′I′","1 |f J 1 ) · L(eI","1, e′I′","1 ) }","Here, L(eI","1, e′I′","1 ) denotes the loss function under","consideration. It measures the loss (or errors) of a","candidate translation eI","1 assuming the correct translation is e′I′","1 . In the following, we will call this decision rule the MBR rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). This decision rule is optimal in the sense that any other decision rule will result (on average) in at least as many errors as the MBR rule. Despite this, most SMT systems do not use the MBR decision rule. The most common approach is to use the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) decision rule. Thus, we select the hypothesis which maximizes the posterior probability P r(eI","1|f J","1 ):","êÎ","1 = argmax","I,eI","1","{","P r(eI","1|f J","1 )}","This is equivalent to the MBR decision rule under a 0-1 loss function:","L0−1(eI 1, e′I′","1 ) = {","0 if eI 1 = e′I′","1 1 else","Hence, the MAP decision rule is optimal for the sentence or string error rate. It is not necessarily optimal for other evaluation metrics such as the Bleu score. One reason for the popularity of the MAP decision rule might be that, compared to the MBR rule, its computation is simpler.","The posterior probability P r(eI","1|f J","1 ) is modeled directly using a log-linear combination of several models (Och and Ney, 2002):","pλM 1","(eI 1|f J","1 ) = exp","(∑M","m=1 λmhm(eI","1, f J","1 )) ∑ I′ ,e′I′","1 exp","(∑M","m=1 λmhm(e′I′","1 , f J","1 ))","(1)","This approach is a generalization of the source-channel approach (Brown et al., 1990). It has the advantage that additional models h(·) can be easily integrated into the overall system.","The denominator represents a normalization factor that depends only on the source sentence f J","1 . Therefore, we can omit it in case of the MAP decision rule during the search process and obtain:","êÎ","1 = argmax","I,eI","1 { M ∑ m=1","λmhm(eI 1, f J","1 ) }","Note that the denominator affects the results of the MBR decision rule and, thus, cannot be omitted in that case.","We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system similar to (Koehn, 2004; Mauser et al., 2006) including the following models: an n-gram language model, a phrase translation model and a word-based lexicon model. The latter two models are used for both directions: p(f |e) and p(e|f ). Additionally, we use a word penalty, phrase penalty and a distor-tion penalty. 525","In the following, we will discuss the so-called training problem (Ney, 2001): how do we train the free parameters λM","1 of the model? The current state-of-the-art is to use minimum error rate training (MERT) as described in (Och, 2003). The free parameters are tuned to directly optimize the evaluation criterion.","Except for the MERT, the training criteria that we will consider are additive at the sentence-level. Thus, the training problem for a development set with S sentences can be formalized as:","λ̂M","1 = argmax","λM","1 S ∑ s=1","F (λM","1 , (eI","1, f J","1 )s) (2) Here, F (·, ·) denotes the training criterion that we would like to maximize and (eI","1, f J","1 )s denotes a sentence pair in the development set. The optimization is done using the Downhill Simplex algorithm from the Numerical Recipes book (Press et al., 2002). This is a general purpose optimization procedure with the advantage that it does not require the derivative information. Before we will describe the details of the different training criteria in Sec. 5 and 6, we will discuss evaluation metrics in the following sec-tion."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation Metrics","paragraphs":["The automatic evaluation of machine translation is currently an active research area. There exists a variety of different metrics, e.g., word error rate, position-independent word error rate, BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST score (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), GTM (Turian et al., 2003). Each of them has advantages and shortcomings.","A popular metric for evaluating machine translation quality is the Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002). It has certain shortcomings for comparing different machine translation systems, especially if comparing conceptually different systems, e.g. phrase-based versus rule-based systems, as shown in (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). On the other hand, Callison-Burch concluded that the Bleu score is reliable for comparing variants of the same machine translation system. As this is exactly what we will need in our experiments and as Bleu is currently the most popular metric, we have chosen it as our primary evaluation metric. Nevertheless, most of the methods we will present can be easily adapted to other automatic evaluation metrics.","In the following, we will briefly review the computation of the Bleu score as some of the training criteria are motivated by this. The Bleu score is a combination of the geometric mean of n-gram precisions and a brevity penalty for too short translation hypotheses. The Bleu score for a translation hypothesis eI","1 and a reference translation êÎ","1 is computed as:","Bleu(eI 1, êÎ","1) = BP(I, Î) · 4 ∏ n=1","Precn(eI 1, êÎ","1)1/4 with BP(I, Î) = { 1 if I ≥ Î exp (1 − I/ Î) if I < Î","Precn(eI 1, êÎ","1) = ∑ wn 1","min{C(wn","1 |eI 1), C(wn","1 |êÎ","1)} ∑ wn 1","C(wn 1 |eI","1) (3)","Here, C(wn","1 |eI","1) denotes the number of occurrences of an n-gram wn","1 in a sentence eI","1. The denominators of the n-gram precisions evaluate to the number of n-grams in the hypothesis, i.e. I − n + 1.","The n-gram counts for the Bleu score computation are usually collected over a whole document. For our purposes, a sentence-level computation is preferable. A problem with the sentence-level Bleu score is that the score is zero if not at least one fourgram matches. As we would like to avoid this problem, we use the smoothed sentence-level Bleu score as suggested in (Lin and Och, 2004). Thus, we increase the nominator and denominator of Precn(·, ·) by one for n > 1. Note that we will use the sentence-level Bleu score only during training. The evaluation on the development and test sets will be carried out using the standard Bleu score, i.e. at the corpus level. As the MERT baseline does not require the use of the sentence-level Bleu score, we use the standard Bleu score for training the baseline system.","In the following, we will describe several criteria for training the log-linear parameters λM","1 of our model. For notational convenience, we assume that there is just one reference translation. Nevertheless, the methods can be easily adapted to the case of multiple references. 526"]},{"title":"5 Maximum Likelihood 5.1 Sentence-Level Computation","paragraphs":["A popular approach for training parameters is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Here, the goal is to maximize the joint likelihood of the parameters and the training data. For log-linear models, this results in a nice optimization criterion which is convex and has a single optimum. It is equivalent to the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. We obtain the following training criterion:","FML−S(λM","1 , (eI 1, f J","1 )) = log pλM","1","(eI 1|f J","1 ) A problem that we often face in practice is that the correct translation might not be among the candidates that our MT system produces. Therefore, (Och and Ney, 2002; Och, 2003) defined the translation candidate with the minimum word-error rate as pseudo reference translation. This has some bias towards minimizing the word-error rate. Here, we will use the translation candidate with the maximum Bleu score as pseudo reference to bias the system towards the Bleu score. However, as pointed out in (Och, 2003), there is no reason to believe that the resulting parameters are optimal with respect to translation quality measured with the Bleu score.","The goal of this sentence-level criterion is to discriminate the single correct translation against all the other ”incorrect” translations. This is problematic as, even for human experts, it is very hard to define a single best translation of a sentence. Furthermore, the alternative target language sentences are not all equally bad translations. Some of them might be very close to the correct translation or even equivalent whereas other sentences may have a completely different meaning. The sentence-level MLE criterion does not distinguish these cases and is therefore a rather harsh training criterion. 5.2 N -gram Level Computation As an alternative to the sentence-level MLE, we performed experiments with an n-gram level MLE. Here, we limit the order of the n-grams and assume conditional independence among the n-gram probabilities. We define the log-likelihood (LLH) of a target language sentence eI","1 given a source language","sentence f J 1 as:","FML−N (λM","1 , (eI","1, f J","1 )) = N ∑ n=1 ∑ wn 1 ∈eI","1","log pλM 1","(wn 1 |f J","1 ) Here, we use the n-gram posterior probability","pλM 1 (wn","1 |f J","1 ) as defined in (Zens and Ney, 2006).","The n-gram posterior distribution is smoothed using","a uniform distribution over all possible n-grams.","pλM 1","(wn 1 |f J","1 ) = α ·","NλM 1","(wn 1 , f J","1 )","∑ w′n","1","NλM 1","(w′n 1 , f J","1 ) + (1 − α) · 1 V n Here, V denotes the vocabulary size of the target language; thus, V n","is the number of possible n-grams in the target language. We define NλM","1","(wn 1 , f J","1 ) as in (Zens and Ney, 2006):","NλM 1","(wn 1 , f J","1 ) = ∑","I,eI 1 I−n+1 ∑ i=1","pλM 1","(eI","1|f J 1 )·δ(ei+n−1","i , wn","1 )","(4) The sum over the target language sentences is limited to an N -best list, i.e. the N best translation candidates according to the baseline model. In this equation, we use the Kronecker function δ(·, ·), i.e. the term δ(ei+n−1","i , wn","1 ) evaluates to one if and only","if the n-gram wn 1 occurs in the target sentence eI","1 starting at position i.","An advantage of the n-gram level computation of the likelihood is that we do not have to define pseudo-references as for the sentence-level MLE. We can easily compute the likelihood for the human reference translation. Furthermore, this criterion has the desirable property that it takes partial correctness into account, i.e. it is not as harsh as the sentence-level criterion."]},{"title":"6 Expected Bleu Score","paragraphs":["According to statistical decision theory, one should maximize the expected gain (or equivalently minimize the expected loss). For machine translation, this means that we should optimize the expected Bleu score, or any other preferred evaluation metric. 527 6.1 Sentence-Level Computation The expected Bleu score for a given source sentence f J 1 and a reference translation êÎ","1 is defined as:","E[Bleu|êÎ 1, f J","1 ] = ∑ eI 1","P r(eI","1|f J 1 ) · Bleu(eI","1, êÎ","1)","Here, P r(eI 1|f J","1 ) denotes the true probability dis-","tribution over the possible translations eI","1 of the given source sentence f J","1 . As this probability distribution is unknown, we approximate it using the log-linear translation model pλM","1","(eI","1|f J","1 ) from Eq. 1. Furthermore, the computation of the expected Bleu score involves a sum over all possible translations eI 1. This sum is approximated using an N -best list, i.e. the N best translation hypotheses of the MT system. Thus, the training criterion for the sentence-level expected Bleu computation is:","FEB−S(λM","1 , (êÎ","1, f J","1 )) = ∑ eI 1","pλM 1","(eI","1|f J 1 )·Bleu(eI","1, êÎ","1) An advantage of the sentence-level computation is that it is straightforward to plug in alternative evaluation metrics instead of the Bleu score. Note that the minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) uses only the target sentence with the maximum posterior probability whereas, here, the whole probability distribution is taken into account. 6.2 N -gram Level Computation In this section, we describe a more fine grained computation of the expected Bleu score by exploiting its particular structure. Hence, this derivation is specific for the Bleu score but should be easily adaptable to other n-gram based metrics. We can rewrite the expected Bleu score as:","E[Bleu|êÎ 1, f J 1 ] = E[BP| Î, f J","1 ] · 4 ∏ n=1","E[Precn|êÎ 1, f J","1 ]1/4","We assumed conditional independence between the brevity penalty BP and the n-gram precisions Precn. Note that although these independence as-sumptions do not hold, the resulting parameters might work well for translation. In fact, we will show that this criterion is among the best perform-ing ones in Sec. 7. This type of independence as-sumption is typical within the naive Bayes classifier framework. The resulting training criterion that we will use in Eq. 2 is then:","FEB−N (λM","1 , (êÎ 1, f J","1 )) = EλM","1","[BP| Î, f J 1 ] · 4 ∏ n=1","EλM 1","[Precn|êÎ 1, f J","1 ]1/4","We still have to define the estimators for the expected brevity penalty as well as the expected n-gram precision:","EλM 1","[BP| Î, f J 1 ] = ∑ I BP(I, Î) · p λM 1","(I|f J 1 )","EλM 1","[Precn|êÎ 1, f J","1 ] = (5) ∑ wn 1","pλM 1","(wn 1 |f J","1 ) ∑ c","min{c, C(wn 1 |êÎ 1)} · pλM","1","(c|wn 1 , f J","1 ) ∑ wn 1","pλM 1","(wn 1 |f J","1 ) ∑ c","c · pλM 1","(c|wn 1 , f J","1 ) Here, we use the sentence length posterior proba-","bility pλM","1","(I|f J 1 ) as defined in (Zens and Ney, 2006)","and the n-gram posterior probability pλM 1","(wn","1 |f J","1 ) as described in Sec. 5.2. Additionally, we predict the number of occurrences c of an n-gram. This information is necessary for the so-called clipping in the Bleu score computation, i.e. the min operator in the nominator of formulae Eq. 3 and Eq. 5. The denominator of Eq. 5 is the expected number of n-grams in the target sentence, whereas the nominator denotes the expected number of correct n-grams.","To predict the number of occurrences within a translation hypothesis, we use relative frequencies smoothed with a Poisson distribution.

This seems reason-able as it is the objective of this training criterion.","The maximum likelihood (MLE) criteria perform somewhat worse under MAP decoding. Interestingly, the MBR decoding can compensate this to a large extent: all criteria achieve a Bleu score of about 18.9% on the development set. The benefits of MBR decoding become even more evident on the two test sets. Here, the MAP results for the sentence-level MLE criterion are rather poor compared to the MERT-Bleu. Nevertheless, using MBR decoding results in very similar Bleu scores for most of the criteria on these two test sets. We can therefore support the claim of (Smith and Eisner, 2006) that MBR tends to have better generalization capabilities.","The n-gram level MLE criterion seems to perform better than the sentence-level MLE criterion, especially on the test sets. The reasons might be that there is no need for the use of pseudo references as described in Sec. 5 and that partial correctness is taken into account.","The best results are achieved using the expected Bleu score criteria described in Sec. 6. Here, the sentence level and n-gram level variants achieve more or less the same results.
