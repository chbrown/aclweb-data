Different dimensionalities are expected under different practical resource restrictions of time or space. Traditionally in text categorization, the same scoring or ranking criterion is adopted for all target dimensionalities, which considers both the discriminability and the coverage of a term, such as χ2","or IG. In this paper, the poor accuracy at a low dimensionality is imputed to the small average vector length of the documents. Scalable term selection is proposed to optimize the term set at a given dimensionality according to an expected average vector length. Discriminability and coverage are separately measured; by adjusting the ratio of their weights in a combined criterion, the expected average vector length can be reached, which means a good compromise between the specificity and the exhaustivity of the term subset. Experiments show that the accuracy is considerably improved at lower dimensionalities, and larger term subsets have the possibility to lower the average vector length for a lower computational cost. The interesting observations might inspire further investigations."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text categorization is a classical text information processing task which has been studied adequately (Sebastiani, 2002). A typical text categorization process usually involves these phases: document indexing, dimensionality reduction, classifier learning, classification and evaluation. The vector space model is frequently used for text representation (document indexing); dimensions of the learning space are called terms, or features in a general machine learning context. Term selection is often necessary because:","• Many irrelevant terms have detrimental effect on categorization accuracy due to overfitting (Sebastiani, 2002).","• Some text categorization tasks have many relevant but redundant features, which also hurt the categorization accuracy (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004).","• Considerations on computational cost: (i) Many sophisticated learning machines are very slow at high dimensionalities, such as LLSF (Yang and Chute, 1994) and SVMs. (ii) In Asian languages, the term set is often very large and redundant, which causes the learning and the predicting to be really slow. (iii) In some practical cases the computational resources (time or space) are restricted, such as hand-held devices, real-time applications and frequently retrained systems. (iv) Some deeper analysis or feature reconstruction techniques rely on matrix factorization (e.g. LSA based on SVD), which might be computationally in-tractable while the dimensionality is large. Sometimes an aggressive term selection might be needed particularly for (iii) and (iv). But it is notable that the dimensionality is not always directly 774 connected to the computational cost; this issue will be touched on in Section 6. Although we have many general feature selection techniques, the do-main specified ones are preferred (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). Another reason for ad hoc term selection techniques is that many other pattern classification tasks has no sparseness problem (in this study the sparseness means a sample vector has few nonzero elements, but not the high-dimensional learning space has few training samples). As a basic motivation of this study, we hypothesize that the low accuracy at low dimensionalities is mainly due to the sparseness problem.","Many term selection techniques were presented and some of them have been experimentally tested to be high-performing, such as Information Gain, χ2 (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002) and Bi-Normal Separation (Forman, 2003). Every-one of them adopt a criterion scoring and ranking the terms; for a target dimensionality d, the term selection is simply done by picking out the top-d terms from the ranked term set. These high performing criteria have a common characteristic — both discriminability and coverage are implicitly considered.","• discriminability: how unbalanced is the distri-","bution of the term among the categories.","• coverage: how many documents does the term","occur in. (Borrowing the terminologies from document indexing, we can say the specificity of a term set corresponds to the discriminability of each term, and the exhaustivity of a term set corresponds to the coverage of each term.) The main difference among these criteria is to what extent the discriminability is emphasized or the coverage is emphasized. For in-stance, empirically IG prefers high frequency terms more than χ2","does, which means IG emphasizes the coverage more than χ2","does.","The problem is, these criteria are nonparametric and do the same ranking for any target dimensionality. Small term sets meet the specificity–exhaustivity dilemma. If really the sparseness is the main reason of the low performance of a small term set, the specificity should be moderately sacrificed to improve the exhaustivity for a small term set; that is to say, the term selection criterion should consider coverage more than discriminability. Contrariwise, coverage could be less considered for a large term set, because we need worry little about the sparseness problem and the computational cost might decrease.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the document collections used in this study, as well as other experiment set-tings; Section 3 investigates the relation between sparseness (measured by average vector length) and categorization accuracy; Section 4 explains the basic idea of scalable term selection and proposed a potential approach; Section 5 carries out experiments to evaluate the approach, during which some empirical rules are observed to complete the approach; Section 6 makes some further observations and discussions based on Section 5; Section 7 gives a conclud-ing remark."]},{"title":"2 Experiment Settings 2.1 Document Collections","paragraphs":["Two document collections are used in this study.","CE (Chinese Encyclopedia): This is from the electronic version of the Chinese Encyclopedia. We choose a Chinese corpus as the primary document collection because Chinese text (as well as other Asian languages) has a very large term set and a satisfying subset is usually not smaller than 50000 (Li et al., 2006); on the contrary, a dimensionality lower than 10000 suffices a general English text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002). For computational cost reasons mentioned in Section 1, Chinese text categorization would benefit more from an high-performing aggressive term selection. This collection contains 55 categories and 71674 documents (9:1 split to training set and test set). Each documents belongs to only one category. Each category contains 399– 3374 documents. This collection was also used by Li et al. (2006).","20NG (20 Newsgroups1","): This classical English document collection is chosen as a secondary in this study to testify the generality of the proposed approach.

This is exactly the case we tend to tackle. For 20NG collection, the indexing units are stemmed2","words. Both term set are df -cut by the most conservative threshold (df ≥ 2). The sizes of the two candidate term sets are |TCE|= 1067717 and |T20NG|= 30220.","Term weighting is done by tfidf (ti, dj) = log(tf (ti, dj) + 1) ·log ( df (ti)+1","Nd ) 3 , in which t","i denotes a term, dj denotes a document, Nd denotes the total document number.","The classifiers used in this study are support vector machines (Joachims, 1998; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004; Chang and Lin, 2001). The kernel type is set to linear, which is fast and enough for text categorization. Also, Brank et al. (2002) pointed out that the complexity and sophistication of the criterion itself is more important to the success of the term selection method than its compatibility in design with the classifier.","Performance is evaluated by microaveraged F1-measure. For single-label tasks, microaveraged precision, recall and F1 have the same value.","χ2","is used as the term selection baseline for its popularity and high performance. (IG was also reported to be good. In our previous experiments, χ2 is generally superior to IG.)

Figure 2 demonstrates this with more clarity. Thus the hypothesis formed in Section 1 is confirmed: there is a strong correlation between the sparseness degree and the categorization error rate.","Therefore, it is quite straightforward a thought to measure the “sparseness of a term subset” (or more precisely, the exhaustivity) by the corresponding average vector length (AVL) of all documents.4","In the","4","Due to the lognormal distribution of vector length, it seems more plausible to average the logarithmic vector length.

A basic guideline is that these two metrics should not be highly (positive) correlated; intuitively, they should have a slight negative correlation. The correlation of the two metrics can be visually estimated by the joint distribution figure. A bunch of term selection metrics were explored by Forman (2003). df (document frequency) is a straightforward choice to measure coverage. Since df follows the Zipf’s law (inverse power law), log(df ) is adopted. High-performing term selection criterion themselves might not be good candidates for the discriminability metric because they take coverage into account. For example, Figure 3 shows that χ2","is not satisfying. (For readability, the grayness is proportional to the log probability density in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 12.) Relatively, probability ratio (Forman, 2003) is a more straight metric of discriminability. PR(ti, c) = P (ti|c+) P (ti|c−) = df (ti, c+)/df (c+) df (ti, c−)/df (c−) It is a symmetric ratio, so log(PR) is likely to be more appropriate. For multi-class categorization, a global value can be assessed by PRmax(ti) = maxc PR(ti, c), like χ2","max for χ2","(Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002; Sebastiani, 2002); for brief, PR denotes PRmax hereafter. The joint distribution of log(PR) and log(df ) is shown in Figure 12. We can see that the distribution is quite even and they have a slight negative correlation. 4.2 Combined Criterion Now we have the two metrics: log(PR) for discriminability and log(df ) for coverage, and a parametric log(df ) χ2 1.10 10.59 1.7 42033.0 Figure 3: ( log(df ), χ2)","Distribution, on CE log(df ) l o g ( P R ) 1.10 10.59 0.40 9.46 Figure 4: (log(df ), log(PR)) Distribution, on CE term selection criterion comes forth: ζ(ti; λ) = (","λ log(PR(ti)) +","1 − λ log(df (ti)) )−1 A weighted harmonic averaging is adopted here because either metric’s being too small is a severe detriment. λ ∈ [0, 1] is the weight for log(PR), which denotes how much the discriminability is emphasized. When the dimensionality is fixed, a smaller λ leads to a larger AVL and a larger λ leads to a smaller AVL. The optimal λ should be a function 777 of the expected dimensionality (k):","λ∗ (k) = arg max","λ F1(Sk(λ)) in which the term subset Sk(λ) ∈ T is selected by ζ(◦; λ) , |Sk|= k, and F1 is the default evaluation criterion.

According to the observations in Section 5.2, AVL other than λ is the direct concern because it is more intrinsic, but λ is the one that can be tuned directly. So, in the experiments, we vary AVL by tuning λ to produce it, which means to calculate λ(AVL).","AVL(λ) is a monotone function and fast to calculate. For a given AVL, the corresponding λ can be quickly found by a Newton iteration in [0,1]. In fact, AVL(λ) is not a continuous function, so λ is only tuned to get an acceptable match, e.g. within ±0.1.","5","STS is tested to the whole T on 20NG but not on CE, because (i) TCE is too large and time consuming for training and testing, and (ii) χ2","was previously tested on larger k and the performance (F1) is not stable while k > 64000.","For each k, by the above way of fitting λ, we manually adjust AVL (only in integers) until F1(Sk(λ(AVL))) peaks.

One important but not plotted property is that the performance of STS is not very sensitive to a small value change of AVL. For instance, at k = 4000, AVL∗","= 120 and the F","1 peak is 85.8824%, and for AVL = 110 and 130 the corresponding F1 are 85.8683% and 85.6583%; at the same k, the F1 of χ2","selection is 82.3950%.
