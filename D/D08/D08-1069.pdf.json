In addition to being conceptually simple, these modifications of the standard single-model, classification-based approach also deliver significant performance improvements. Specifi-cally, we show that on the ACE corpus both strategies produce f -score gains of more than 3% across the three coreference evaluation metrics (MUC, B3",", and CEAF)."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Coreference resolution is the task of partitioning a set of entity mentions in a text, where each partition corresponds to some entity in an underlying discourse model. While early machine learning approaches for the task relied on local, discriminative classifiers (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Morton, 2000; Kehler et al., 2004), more recent approaches use joint and/or global models (McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Ng, 2004; Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Denis and Baldridge, 2007a). This shift improves performance, but the systems are consider-ably more complex and often less efficient. Here, we explore two simple modifications of the first type of approach that yield performance gains which are comparable, and sometimes better, to those obtained with these more complex systems. These modifications involve: (i) the use of rankers instead of classifiers, and (ii) the use of linguistically motivated, specialized models for different types of mentions.","Ranking models provide a theoretically more adequate and empirically better alternative approach to pronoun resolution than standard classification-based approaches (Denis and Baldridge, 2007b). In essence, ranking models directly capture during training the competition among potential antecedent candidates, instead of considering them independently. This gives the ranker additional discriminative power and in turn better antecedent selection accuracy. Here, we show that ranking is also effective for the wider task of coreference resolution.","Coreference resolution involves several different types of anaphoric expressions: third-person pronouns, speech pronouns (i.e., first and second person pronouns), proper names, definite descriptions and other types of nominals (e.g., anaphoric uses of indefinite, quantified, and bare noun phrases). Different anaphoric expressions exhibit different patterns of resolution and are sensitive to different factors (Ariel, 1988; van der Sandt, 1992; Gundel et al., 1993), yet most machine learning approaches have ignored these differences and handle these different phenomena with a single, monolithic model. A few exceptions are worth noting. Morton (2000) and Ng (2005b) propose different classifiers models for different NPs for coreference resolution and pronoun resolution, respectively. Other partially capture the differential preferences between different anaphors via different sample selection strategies during training (Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Uryupina, 2004). More recently, Haghighi and Klein (2007) use the distinc-tion between pronouns, nominals and proper nouns 660 in their unsupervised, generative model for coreference resolution; for their model, this is absolutely critical for achieving better accuracy. Here, we show that using specialized models for different types of referential expressions improves performance for supervised models (both classifiers and rankers).","Both these strategies lead to improvements for all three standard coreference metrics: MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3","(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), and CEAF (Luo, 2005). In particular, our specialized ranker system provides absolute f -score improvements against an otherwise identical standard classifier system by 3.2%, 3.1%, and 3.6% forMUC, B3",", and CEAF, respectively."]},{"title":"2 Ranking","paragraphs":["Numerous approaches to anaphora and coreference resolution reduce these tasks to a binary classification task, whereby pairs of mentions are classified as coreferential or not (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b). Usually used in combination with a greedy right-to-left clustering, these approaches make very strong independence assumptions. Not only do they model each coreference decision separately, they actually model each pair of mentions as a separate event. Recast-ing these tasks as ranking tasks partly addresses this problem by directly making the comparison between different candidate antecedents for an anaphor part of the training criterion. Each candidate is assigned a conditional probability with respect to the entire candidate set. (Re)rankers have been successfully applied to numerous NLP tasks, such as parse selection (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004; Toutanova et al., 2004), parse reranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Charniak and Johnson, 2005), question-answering (Ravichandran et al., 2003).","The twin-candidate classification approach pro-posed by (Yang et al., 2003) shares some similarities with the ranker in making the comparison between candidate antecedents part of training. An important difference however is that under the twin-candidate approach, candidates are compared in pairwise fashion (and the best overall candidate is the one that has won the most round robin contests), while the ranker considers the entire candidate set at once. Another advantage of the ranking approach is that its complexity is only square in the number of mentions, while that of the twin-candidate model is cubic (see Denis and Baldridge (2007b) for a more detailed comparison in the context of pronoun resolution).","Our ranking models for coreference take the following log-linear form: Prk(αi|π) = exp m∑","j=1 wjfj(π, αi) ∑","k exp m∑ j=1 wjfj(π, αk) (1) where π stands for the anaphoric expression, αi for an antecedent candidate, fj the weighted features of the model. The denominator consists of a normalization factor over the k candidate mentions. Model parameters were estimated with the limited memory variable metric algorithm and Gaussian smoothing (σ2","=1000), using TADM (Malouf, 2002).","For the training of the different ranking models, we use the following procedure. For each model, instances are created by pairing each anaphor of the proper type (e.g., definite description) with a set of candidates which contains: (i) a true antecedent, and (ii) a set of non-antecedents. The selection of the true antecedent varies depending on the model we are training: for pronominal forms, the antecedent is selected as the closest preceding mention in the chain; for non-pronominal forms, we used the closest preceding non-pronominal mention in the chain as the antecedent. For the creation of the non-antecedent set, we collect all the non-antecedents that appear in a window of two sentences around the antecedent.1","At test time, we consider all preceding mentions as potential antecedents.","Not all referential expressions in a given document are anaphors: some expressions introduce a discourse entity, rather than accessing an existing one. Thus, coreference resolvers must have a way of identifying such “discourse-new” expressions. This is easily handled in the standard classification approach: a mention will not be resolved if none of its candidates is classified positively (i.e., as coreferential). The problem is more troublesome for rankers, which always pick an antecedent from the candidate 1","We suspect that different varying windows might be more appropriate for different types of expressions, but leaves this for further investigations. 661 set. A natural solution is to use a model that specifi-cally predicts the discourse status (discourse-new vs. discourse-old) of each expression: only expressions that are classified as “discourse-old” by this model are considered by rankers.","Ng and Cardie (Ng and Cardie, 2002a) introduced the use of an “anaphoricity” classifier to act as a filter for coreference resolution in order to correct errors where antecedents are mistakenly identified for non-anaphoric mentions or antecedents are not determined for mentions which are indeed anaphoric. Their approach produced significant improvements in precision, but with consequent larger losses in recall. Ng (2004) improves recall by optimizing the anaphoricity threshold. By using joint inference for anaphoricity and coreference, Denis and Baldridge (2007a) avoid cascade-induced errors without the need to separately optimize the threshold.","We use a similar discourse status classifier to Ng and Cardie’s as a filter on mentions for our rankers. We rely on three main types of information sources: (i) the form of mention (e.g., type of linguistic expression, number of tokens), (ii) positional features in the text, (iii) comparisons of the given mention to the mentions that precede it in the text. Evaluated on the ACE datasets, training the model on the train texts, and applying the classifier to the devtest texts, the model achieves an overall accuracy score of 80.8%, compared to a baseline of 59.7% when predicting the majority class (“discourse-old”)."]},{"title":"3 Specialized models","paragraphs":["Our second strategy is to use different, specialized models for different referential expressions, similarly to Elwell and Baldridge’s (2008) use of connective specific models for identifying the arguments of discourse connectives. For this, one must determine along which dimension to split such expressions. For example, Ng (2005b) learns models for each set of anaphors that are lexically identical (e.g., I, he, they, etc.). This option is possible for closed sets like pronouns, but not for other types of anaphors like proper names and definite descriptions. Another option is to rely on the particular linguistic form of the different expressions, as signaled by the head word category and the determiner (if any). More concretely, we use separate models for the following types: (i) third person pronouns, (ii) speech pronouns, (iii) proper names, (iv) definite descriptions, and (v) others (i.e., all expressions that don’t fall into the previous categories).","The correlation between the form of a referential expression and its anaphoric behavior is actually central to various linguistic accounts (Prince, 1981; Ariel, 1988; Gundel et al., 1993). Basically, the idea is that linguistic form is an indicator of the status of the corresponding referent in the discourse model. That is, the use by the speaker of a particular linguistic form corresponds to a particular level of activation (or familiarity or salience or accessibility) in (what she thinks is) the addressee’s discourse model. For many authors, the relation takes the form of a continuum and is often represented in the form of a referential hierarchy, such as: Accessibility Hierarchy (Ariel, 1988) Zero pronouns >> Pronouns >> Demonstrative pronouns >> Demonstrative NPs >> Short PNs >> Definite descriptions>> Full PNs >> Full PNs + appositive The higher up, the more accessible (or salient) the entity is. At the extremes are pronouns (these forms typically require a previous mention in the local context) and proper names (these forms are often used without previous mentions of the entity). This type of hierarchy is validated by corpus studies of the distribution of different types of expressions. For instance, pronouns find their antecedents very lo-cally (in a window of 1-2 sentences), while proper names predominantly find theirs at longer distances (Ariel, 1988).2","Using discourse structure, Asher et al. (2006) show that while anaphoric pronouns systematically obey the right-frontier constraint (i.e., their antecedents have to appear on the right edge of the discourse graph), this is less so for definites, and even less so for proper names.","From a machine learning perspective, these find-ings suggest that features encoding some aspect of salience (e.g., distance, syntactic context) are likely to receive different sets of parameters depending on the form of the anaphor. This therefore suggests that better parameters are likely to be learned in the 2","Haghighi and Klein’s (2007) generative coreference model mirrors this in the posterior distribution which it assigns to mention types given their salience (see their Table 1). 662 Type/Count train test","3rd pron. 4, 389 1, 093 speech pron. 2, 178 610 proper names 7, 868 1, 532 def.

Thus, the resolution of lexical expressions like definite descriptions and proper names is likely to benefit from the inclusion of features that compare the strings of the anaphor and the candidate antecedent (e.g., string matching) and features that identify particular syntactic configurations like appositive structures. This type of information is however much less likely to help in the resolution of pronominal forms. The problem is that, within a single model, such features are likely to receive strong parameters (due to the fact that they are good predictors for lexical anaphors) in a way that might eventually hurt pronominal resolutions.","Note that our split of referential types only partially cover the referential hierarchies of Ariel (1988) or Gundel et al. (1993). Thus, there is no separate model for demonstrative noun phrases and pronouns: these are very rare in the corpus we used (i.e., the ACE corpus).4","These expressions were therefore handled through the “others” model. There is however a model for first and second person pronouns (i.e., speech pronouns): this is justified by the fact that these pronouns behave differently from their third person counterparts. These forms indeed often behave like deictics (i.e., they refer to discourse participants) or they appear within a quote.","The total number of anaphors (i.e., of mentions that are not chain heads) in the data is 19, 322 and 4, 599 for training and testing, respectively. The distribution of each anaphoric type is presented in Table 1.

The distribution is slightly different from one dataset to another, probably reflecting genre differences. For instance, BNEWS shows a larger proportion of pronouns in general (pronominal forms account for 40-44% of all the anaphoric forms).","We use five broad types of features for all mention types, plus three others used by specific types, summarized in Table 3. Our feature extraction relies on limited linguistic processing: we only made use of a sentence detector, a tokenizer, a POS tagger (as provided by the OpenNLP Toolkit5",") and the WordNet6 database. Since we did not use parser, lexical heads for the NP mentions were computed using simple heuristics relying solely on POS sequences. Table 2 describes in detail the entire feature set, and Table 3 shows which features were used for which models.

Context: the context of the antecedent candidate: these features can be seen as approximations of the grammatical roles, as indicators of the salience of the potential candidate (Grosz et al., 1995). For instance, this includes the part of speech tags surrounding the candidate, as well as a feature that indicates whether the potential antecedent is the first mention in a sentence (approximating subjecthood), and a feature indicating whether the candidate is embedded inside another mention. Distance: the distance between the anaphor and the candidate, measured by the number of sentences and mentions between them. Morphosyntactic agreement: indicators of the gender, number, and person of the two mentions. These are determined for non-pronominal NPs with heuristics based on POS tags (e.g., NN vs. NNS for number) and actual mention strings (e.g., whether the mention contains a male/female first name or honorific for gender). These features consist of pairs of attributes, ensuring that not only strict agreement (e.g., singular-singular) but also mere compatibility (e.g., masculine-unknown) is captured. Semantic compatibility: features designed to assess whether the two mentions are semantically compatible. For these features, we use the Word-Net database: in particular, we collected the synonym set (or synset) as well as the synset of their direct hypernyms associated with each mention. In the case of common nouns, we used the synset associated with the first sense associated with the mention’s head word. In the case of proper names, we used the synset associated with the name if available, and the string itself otherwise. For pronouns (which are not part of Wordnet), we simply used the pronominal form.","All these features were used in all five models. While one may question the use of distance for non-pronominal anaphors,7","their inclusion can be justified in that they might predict some “obviation” effects. Definite descriptions and proper names are sensitive to distance too, although not in the same way as pronouns are: they show a preference for antecedents that appear outside a window of one or two sentences (Ariel, 1988).","Several features are used only for particular mention types: String similarity: similarity of the anaphor and the candidate strings. Examples are perfect string match, substring matches, and head match (i.e., the two mentions share the same head word). Appositive: whether the anaphor is an appositive of the antecedent candidate. Since we do not have access to syntactic structure, we use heuristics (e.g., the presence of a comma between the two mentions) to extract this feature. Acronym: whether the anaphor string is an acronym of the candidate string (or vice versa): e.g., NSF and National Science Foundation."]},{"title":"4 Coreference systems","paragraphs":["We evaluate several systems to explore the effect of ranking versus classification and specialized versus monolithic models. The different systems follow a generic architecture. Let M be the set of mentions present in a document. For all models, each mention m ∈ M is associated at test time with a set of antecedent candidates Cm, which includes all the mentions that linearly precede m. The best candidate is determined by the model in use. The final output of each system consists in a list of mention pairs (i.e., the coreference links) which in turn defines (through reflexive, transitive closure) a partition over the set M. Our models are summarized in Table 4.","The use of the discourse status filter is straightforward. For each mention m∈M, the discourse status 7 In fact, Morton (2000) does not use distance in this case. 664 Model Disc. Model Name Type Specialized?

If m is classified as “new”, the process terminates and goes to the next mention. If m is classified as “old”, m along with its set of antecedent candidates Cm is sent to the model.","For classifiers, we replicate the procedures of Ng and Cardie (2002b). During training, instances are formed by pairing each anaphor with each of its preceding candidates, until the antecedent is reached: the closest preceding antecedent in the case of a pronominal anaphor, or the closest non-pronominal antecedent for other anaphor types. For classifiers, the use of a discourse status filter at test time is optional. When a filter is not used, then a mention is left unresolved if none of the pairs created for a given mention is classified positively. If several pairs for a given mention are classified positively, then the pair with the highest score is selected (i.e., “Best-First” link selection). If a filter is used, then the candidate with the highest score is selected, even if the probability of coreference is less than one-half.8","The use of specialized models is simple, for both classifiers and rankers. Specialized models are created for: (i) third person pronouns, (ii) speech pronouns, (iii) proper names, (iv) definite descriptions, (v) other types of phrases.

An important difference is that their system does not necessarily yield an antecedent for each of the anaphors pro-posed by the discourse status model. In their system, if the coreference classifier finds that none of the candidates for a “new” mention are coreferential, it leaves it unresolved. In this case, the coreference model acts as an additional filter. Not surprisingly, these authors report gains in precision but comparatively larger losses in recall. Our development experiments revealed that forcing a decision on items identified as new provided performed better across all metrics.

For the classifiers that do not use specialized models (CLASS and CLASS+DS), we have also added extra features describing the linguistic form of the potential anaphor (whether it is a pronoun, a proper name, and so on). This is in accordance with standard feature sets in the pairwise approach. It gives these models a chance to learn weights more appropriately for the different types within a single, monolithic model."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We use the ACE corpus (Phase 2). The corpus has three parts, each corresponding to a different genre: newspaper texts (NPAPER), newswire texts (NWIRE), and broadcast news (BNEWS). Each set is split into a train part and a devtest part. In our experiments, we consider only true ACE mentions. 5.1 Antecedent selection results We first evaluate the specialized ranker models individually on the task of anaphora resolution: their ability to select a correct antecedent for each anaphor. Following common practice in this task, we report results in terms of accuracy, which is simply the ratio of correctly resolved anaphors. The candidate set during testing was formed by taking all the mentions that appear before the anaphor. Also, we assume that correctly resolving an anaphor amounts to selecting any of the previous mentions in the entity as the antecedent. The accuracy scores for the different models are presented in Table 5. 665","The best accuracy results on the entire ACE corpus are found first for the proper name resolver with a score of 83.5%, then for the third person pronoun resolver with 82.2%, then for the definite descrip-tion and speech pronoun resolvers with 66.9% and 66.5% respectively. The worst scores are obtained for the “others” category. The high scores for the third person pronoun and the proper name rankers most likely follow from the fact that the resolution of these expressions relies on simple, reliable predictors, such as distance and morphosyntactic agreement for pronouns, and string similarity features for proper names. The resolution of definite descriptions and other types of lexical NPs (which are handled through the “others” model) are much more challenging: they rely on lexical semantic and world knowledge, which is only partially encoded via our WordNet-based features. Finally, note that the resolution of speech pronouns is also much harder than that of the other pronominal forms: these expressions are much less (if at all) constrained by recency and agreement. Furthermore, these expressions show a lot of cataphoric uses, which are not considered by our models. The low scores for the “others” category is likely due to the fact that it encompasses very different referential expressions. 5.2 Coreference Results For evaluating the coreference performance, we rely on three primary metrics: (i) the link based MUC metric (Vilain et al., 1995), the mention based B3 metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), and the entity based CEAF metric (Luo, 2005). Common to these metrics is: (i) they operate by comparing the set of chains S produced by the system against the true chains T , and (ii) they report performance in terms of recall and precision. There are however important differences in how each metric computes these scores, each producing a different bias.","MUC scores are based on the number of links (pairs of mentions) common to S and T . Recall is the number of common links divided by the total number of links in T ; precision is the number of common links divided by the total number of links in S. This focus gives MUC two main biases. First, it favors systems that create large chains (and thus fewer entities). For instance, a system that produces a single chain achieves 100% recall without severe degradation in precision. Second, it ignores single mention entities, which are involved in no links.9","The B3","metric was designed to address the MUC metric’s shortcomings. It is mention-based: it computes both recall and precision scores for each mention i. Let S be the system chain containing m, T be the true chain containing m. The set of correct elements in S is thus |S ∩ T |. The recall score for a mention i is |S∩T |","|T | , while the precision score for i is |S∩T |","|S| . Overall recall/precision is obtained by averaging over the individual mention scores. The fact that this metric is mention-based by definition solves the problem of single mention entities. Also solved is the bias favoring larger chains, since this will be penalized in the precision score of each mention.","The Constrained Entity Aligned F-Measure (CEAF) (Luo, 2005). aligns each system chain S with at most one true chain T . It finds the best one-to-one mapping between the set of chains S and T , which is equivalent to finding the optimal alignment in a bipartite graph. The best mapping maximizes the similarity over pairs of chains (Si, Ti), where the similarity between two chains is the number of common mentions to the two chains. With CEAF, recall is computed as the total similarity divided by the number of mentions in all the T (i.e., the self-similarity), while precision is the total similarity divided by the number of mentions in S.","Table 6 gives scores for all three metrics for the different models on the entire ACE corpus. Two main patterns emerge: significant improvements are obtained by using specialized models (CLASS vs CLASS+SP and CLASS+DS vs CLASS+DS+SP) and by using a ranker (CLASS+DS+SP vs RANK+DS+SP). Overall, the RANK+DS+SP system significantly outperforms the other systems on the three different metrics.10","The f -scores for RANK+DS+SP are 71.6% with the MUC metric, 72.7% with the B3",", and 67.0% with the CEAF metric.

Smaller but still significant gains are made in precision: RANK+DS+SP is also able to reduce the proportion of invalid links.","The overall improvements found with RANK+DS+SP suggest that it is able to capitalize on the better antecedent selection capabilities offered by the ranking approach. This is supported by the error analysis on the development data. Errors made by a coreference system can be conceptualized as falling into three main classes: (i) “missed anaphors” (i.e., an anaphoric mention that fails to be linked to a previous mention), (ii) “spurious anaphors” (i.e., an non-anaphoric mention that is linked to a previous mention), and (iii) “invalid resolutions” (i.e., a true anaphor that is linked to a 11 Recall that recall and precision scores are identical with","CEAF, due to the fact that we are using true mention boundaries. incorrect antecedent). The two first types of error pertain to the determination of the discourse status of the mention, while the third regards the selection of an antecedent (i.e., anaphora resolution). Considering the systems’ invalid resolutions, we found that the RANK+DS+SP had a much lower error rate: only 17.9% of all true anaphors were incorrectly resolved by this system, against 23.1% for CLASS, 24.9% for CLASS+DS, 20.4% for CLASS+SP, and 22.1% for CLASS+DS+SP.","Denis (2007) provides multi-metric scores for the JOINT-ILP model of Denis and Baldridge (2007a), which uses integer linear programming for joint inference over coreference resolution and discourse status: f -scores of 73.3%, 68.0%, and 58.9% for MUC, B3",", and CEAF, respectively.

Interestingly, RANK+DS+SP actually performs better across all metrics despite being a simpler model with fewer sources of information. 5.3 Oracle results Using specialized rankers with a discourse status classifier yields coreference performance superior to that given by various classification-based baseline systems. Crucially, these improvements have been 667 System MUC B3 CEAF R P F R P F F RANK+DS+SP 67.9 75.7 71.6 66.8 79.8 72.7 67.0 RANK+DS-ORACLE+SP 79.1 79.1 79.1 75.4 76.0 75.7 76.9 LINK-ORACLE 78.8 100.0 88.1 74.3 100.0 85.2 79.7 Table 7: Recall (R), Precision (P), and f -score (F) results for RANK+DS-ORACLE+SP and LINK-ORACLE on the entire ACE corpus. possible using a discourse status model that has an accuracy of just 80.8%. Clearly, the performance of the discourse status module has a direct impact on the performance of the entire coreference system. On the one hand, misclassified anaphors are simply not resolved by the rankers: this limits the recall of the coreference system. On the other hand, misclassified non-anaphors are linked to a previous mention: this limits precision.","In order to further assess the impact of the errors made by the discourse status classifier, we build two different oracle systems. The first oracle system, RANK+DS-ORACLE+SP, uses the specialized rankers in combination with a perfect discourse status classifier. That is, this system knows for each mention whether it is anaphoric or not: the only errors made by such a system are invalid resolutions. RANK+DS-ORACLE+SP thus provides an upperbound for the RANK+DS+SP model. The results for this oracle are given in Table 7: they show substantial improvements over RANK+DS+SP, which suggests that the RANK+DS+SP has also the potential to be further improved if used in combination with a more accurate discourse status classifier.","The second oracle system, LINK-ORACLE, uses the discourse status classifier with a perfect coreference resolver. That is, this system has perfect knowledge regarding the antecedents of anaphors: the errors made by such a system are only errors in the discourse status of mentions. The results for LINK-ORACLE are also reported in Table 7. These figures show that however accurate our models are at pick-ing a correct antecedent for a true anaphor, the best they can achieve in terms of f -scores is 88.1% with MUC, 85.2% with B3",", and 79.7% with CEAF."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We present and evaluate two straight-forward tactics for improving coreference resolution: (i) ranking models, and (ii) separate, specialized models for different types of referring expressions. The specialized rankers are used in combination with a discourse status classifier which determines the mentions that are sent to the rankers. This simple pipeline architecture produces significant improvements over various implementations of the standard, classifier-based coreference system. In turn, these strategies could be integrated with the joint inference models we have explored elsewhere (Denis and Baldridge, 2007a; Denis, 2007) and which have obtained performance improvements that are orthogonal to those obtained here.","This paper’s improvements are consistent across the three main coreference evaluation metrics: MUC, B3",", and CEAF.12","We attribute improvements to: (i) the better antecedent selection capabilities offered by the ranking approach, and (ii) the division of labor between specialized models, allowing each one to better model the corresponding distribution."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Nicholas Asher, Andy Kehler, Ray Mooney, and the three anonymous reviewers for their comments.
