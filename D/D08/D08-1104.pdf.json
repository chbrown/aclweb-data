To this end, we have constructed an idiom corpus for Japanese. This paper reports on the corpus and the results of an idiom identification experiment using the corpus. The corpus targets 146 ambiguous idioms, and consists of 102,846 sentences, each of which is annotated with a literal/idiom label. For idiom identification, we targeted 90 out of the 146 idioms and adopted a word sense disambiguation (WSD) method using both common WSD features and idiom-specific features. The corpus and the experiment are the largest of their kind, as far as we know. As a result, we found that a standard supervised WSD method works well for the idiom identification and achieved an accuracy of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-specific features and that the most effective idiom-specific feature is the one involving the adjacency of idiom constituents."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Some phrases like kick the bucket are ambiguous with regard to whether they carry literal or idiomatic meaning in a certain context. This ambiguity needs to be resolved in the same manner as ambiguous words that have been dealt with in the WSD literature. We term the resolution of the literal/idiomatic ambiguity as idiom identification, hereafter.","Idiom identification is classified into two kinds; one is for idiom types and the other is for idiom to-kens. With the former, phrases that can be interpreted as idioms are found in text corpora, typically for compiling idiom dictionaries. On the other hand, the latter helps identify a phrase in context as a true idiom or a phrase that should be interpreted literally (a literal phrase, henceforth). In this paper, we deal with the latter, i.e., idiom token identification.","Despite the recent enthusiasm for multiword expressions (MWEs) (Grégoire et al., 2007; Grégoire et al., 2008), the idiom token identification is in an early phase of its development. Given that many NLP tasks like machine translation or parsing have been developed as a result of the availability of language resources, idiom token identification should also be developed when adequate idiom resources are provided. To this end, we have constructed a Japanese idiom corpus. We have also conducted an idiom identification experiment using the corpus that we hope will be a good reference point for future studies on the task. We drew on a standard WSD framework with machine learning exploiting both features commonly used in the WSD studies and idiom-specific features. This paper reports in detail the corpus and the result of the experiment; herein, it must be noted that to the best of our knowledge, the corpus and the experiment are the largest ever of their kind.","We only deal with the ambiguity between literal and idiomatic interpretations. However, some phrases have two or more idiomatic meanings without context. For example, a Japanese idiom te-o dasu (hand-ACC stretch)1","can be interpreted as ei-1 ACC is the accusative case marker. Likewise we use the","following notation in this paper; NOM for the nominative case 992 ther “punch,” “steal” or “make moves on.” This kind of ambiguity should be placed on the agenda.","We do not tackle the problem of what constitutes the notion of “idiom.” We simply regard phrases listed in Sato (2007) as idioms.","The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In §2 we present related works. §3 shows the target idioms. After the idiom corpus is described in §4, we detail our idiom identification method and experiment in §5. Finally §6 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There have only been a few works on the construction of an idiom corpus. In this regard, Birke and Sarkar (2006) and Cook et al. (2008) are no-table exceptions. Birke and Sarkar (2006) automatically constructed a corpus of English idiomatic expressions (words that can be used non-literally). They targeted 50 expressions and collected about 6,600 examples. They call the corpus TroFi Example Base, which is available on the Web.2","Cook et al. (2008) compiled a corpus of English verbnoun combinations (VNCs) tokens. Their corpus deals with 53 VNC expressions and consists of about 3,000 example sentences. Like ours, they assigned each example with a label indicating whether an expression in the example is used literally or idiomatically. Our corpus can be regarded as the Japanese idiom counterpart of these works. However, note that our corpus targets 146 idioms and consists of as many as 102,846 example sentences. Another exception is Tsuchiya et al. (2006), who manually constructed an example database of Japanese compound functional expressions named MUST. They provide it on the Web.3","Some of the compound functional expressions in Japanese are ambiguous like idioms are.4 marker, DAT for the dative case marker, and GEN for the genitive case marker. FROM and TO stand for the Japanese counterparts of from and to. NEG represents a verbal negation morpheme. 2","http://www.cs.sfu.ca/∼","anoop/students/jbirke/ 3","http://nlp.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/must/ 4","For example, (something)-ni-atatte ((something)-DATrun.into) means either “run into (something)” or “on the occasion of (something).” The former is the literal interpretation and the latter is the idiomatic interpretation of the compound functional expression.","The SAID dataset5","provides data about the syntactic flexibility of English idioms. It does not concern itself with idiom token identification. However, as in Hashimoto et al. (2006b), Hashimoto et al. (2006a) and Cook et al. (2007) among others, the syntactic behavior of idioms is an important clue to idiom token identification.","Previous studies have mostly focused on the idiom type identification (Lin, 1999; Krenn and Evert, 2001; Baldwin et al., 2003; Shudo et al., 2004; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). However, there has been a growing interest in idiom token identification in recent times (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Hashimoto et al., 2006b; Hashimoto et al., 2006a; Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Cook et al., 2007). Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) compared the word vector of an idiom in context and that of the constituent words of the idiom using LSA in order to determine if the expression is idiomatic. Hashimoto et al. (2006b) and Hashimoto et al. (2006a) (HSU henceforth) focused their attention on the differences in grammatical constraints imposed on idioms and their literal counterparts such as the possibility of passiviza-tion, and developed handcrafted rules for Japanese idiom identification. Although their task is exactly the same as ours and we draw on the grammatical knowledge provided by them, the scale of their experiment is very small, since only 108 sentences were used for idiom identification in their paper. Further, unlike HSU, we employ matured WSD technologies. Cook et al. (2007) (CFS henceforth) propose an unsupervised method for English on the basis of the observation that idioms tend to be expressed in a small number of fixed forms.","These studies used only the characteristics of idioms (or MWEs). On the other hand, we exploit a WSD method, for which there have been many studies and matured technologies, in addition to the characteristics of idioms. Birke and Sarkar (2006) also used WSD. However, they employed an unsupervised method, while ours is a completely supervised one.","Apart from idioms, Uchiyama et al. (2005) conducted the token classification of Japanese compound verbs exploiting supervised method. 5http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/ CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T10 993"]},{"title":"3 Target Idioms","paragraphs":["For this study, we selected 146 idioms through the following procedure. 1 We extracted basic idioms from Sato (2007). Sato compiled about 3,600 basic idioms of Japanese from five books: two dictionaries for elementary school, two idiom dictionaries, and one linguistics book on idioms. We extracted those idioms that were described in more than two of these five books. The total number of such idioms added up to 926. 2 From among these idioms, we chose ambiguous ones.6","As a result, 146 idioms were selected.","As for 2 , sometimes it is not trivial to determine if an idiom is ambiguous or not. Some idioms are rarely interpreted literally, while others, in all likelihood, take on the literal meaning. Is it meaningful to regard them as ambiguous and deal with them in this study? If not, how does one assuredly distinguish truly ambiguous idioms from those that are mostly interpreted either literally or figuratively? This can only be done if there is an accurate idiom identification system.","After all, we asked two native speakers of Japanese (Group A) to classify idioms into two classes: 1) truly ambiguous ones and 2) completely unambiguous or practically unambiguous ones. On the basis of the classification, one of the authors made final judgments.","To verify how stable this ambiguity endorsement was, we asked another two other native speakers of Japanese (Group B) to perform the same task and calculated the Kappa statistic between the two speakers. First, we sampled 101 idioms from the 926 chosen earlier. Then, the two members of Group B classified the sampled idioms into the two classes. The Kappa statistic was found to be 0.6576, which indicates middling stability.","Tables 2 and 3 list some of the target idioms."]},{"title":"4 Idiom Corpus4.1 Corpus Specification","paragraphs":["The corpus is designed for the idiom token identification task.

We call the former the positive example and the latter the negative example. More specifically, the corpus consists of lines that each represent one example. A line consists of four fields as follows: 1 Label indicates whether the example is positive or negative. Label i is used for positive examples and l for negative ones. 2 ID denotes the idiom that is included in the example. In this study, each idiom has a unique number, which is based on Sato (2007). 3 Lemma also shows the idiom in the example. We assigned each idiom its canonical (or standard) form on the basis of Sato (2007). 4 Example is the example itself.","Given below is a sample of a negative example of goma-o suru (sesame-ACC crush) ’flatter’. • l 1417 !\"#$% $&’(!\"#$& ···","The third field is the lemma of the idiom.

To be more precise, this reference specified literal and idiomatic meanings for each idiom like dictionaries do. For example, the entry for goma-o suru in the reference is as follows. Idiom: To flatter people. Literal: To crush sesame.","As for the corpus size, we continued to annotate examples for each idiom, regardless of the proportion of idioms and literal phrases, until the total number of examples for each idiom reached 1,000.7 In the case of a shortage of original data, we annotated as many examples as possible. The original data were sourced from the Japanese Web corpus (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006). 4.2 Corpus Construction We constructed the corpus in the following manner: 1 From the Web corpus, we collected example sentences that contained one of our target idioms whichever meaning (positive or negative) they","7","For idioms that we sampled for preliminary annotation, we annotated more than 1,000 examples. 994 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 # of Types # of Examples Figure 1: Distribution of the number of examples take on.

This was done by human annotators and was based on the reference to distinguish the two meanings. For annotation, longer examples were given higher priority than shorter examples. Note that we discarded examples that were collected by mistake due to dependency parsing errors and those that lacked a context that could help them be interpreted correctly.","This was done by the two members of Group A and took 230 hours. 4.3 Status of Corpus The corpus consists of 102,846 examples.9","Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of examples.

Nevertheless, both systems outperformed the baseline. Especially, the system without the idiom-specific features has a noticeable lead over the baseline, showing that WSD technologies are effective in the idiom identification. Incorporating the idiom features into the system improved the overall performance, which is statistically significant (Mc-Nemar test, p<0.01). But performances of some idioms slightly degraded by the incorporation of the idiom features.","Table 4: Overall Results without Using One of the Idiom","Features","Feature Type Acc All 89.25 −f8 (w/o Adnominal modification flag) 89.24 −f9 (w/o Topic case marking flag) 89.22 −f10 (w/o Voice alternation flag) 89.15 −f11 (w/o Negation flag) 89.17 −f12 (w/o Volitional modality flag) 89.19 −f13 (w/o Adjacency flag) 89.09","Table 4 shows overall results without using one of the idiom features.21","As you see, the adjacency flag (f13) contributes to idiom identification accuracy the most.22","On the other hand, the adnominal modification flag (f8) contributes to the task only slightly.23 21","The first row shows the result with all idiom features used, just for ease of reference. 22","Note that greater performance drop indicates greater contribution. 23","This result is inconsistent with the result obtained in HSU, where they reported that grammatical constraints involving adnominal modification was most effective. This inconsistency might be attributed to the differences of datasets being used for idiom identification experiment. HSU used only 108 sentences 999 Table 5: Results reported in CFS Accu RER Baseline 61.9 — Unsupervised 72.4 27.6 Supervised 76.2 37.5","Table 5 shows the results reported in CFS. Their baseline system regards all instances as idioms. The performance of the supervised one is obtained by the method of Katz and Giesbrecht (2006). Though we cannot simply compare this with our results due to the difference in experimental conditions, this implies that our WSD-based method was equally good or possibly better than their methods that are tailored to MWEs."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we reported on the idiom corpus we have constructed and the idiom identification experiment using the corpus.","As mentioned in §4.3, some idioms are short of examples in the current idiom corpus. We plan to collect more examples by using different characters. In the Japanese language, there are basically three character systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Chinese characters. Thus, you can write an idiom in different characters. For example, mune-o utu (chest-ACC hit) ‘impress’ can be either 8#: or 8#X.","In spite of its imperfection, we are sure that we can learn a lot about the idiom identification from the corpus, since, as far as we know, it is the largest-ever one, and so is the idiom identification experiment reported in §5.","Also, we showed that a standard supervised WSD method works well for the idiom identification. Our system achieved the accuracy of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-specific features.","Though we dealt with as many as 90 idioms, practical NLP systems are required to deal with many more idioms. Toward a scalable idiom identification, we have to develop an unsupervised or semi-supervised method. The unsupervised method of for the experiment, while 75,011 sentences were used for our experiment. Also, the dataset of HSU came from newspaper articles, while our dataset came from the web. Birke and Sarkar (2006) requires WordNet. Fortunately, the Japanese WordNet is now available (Isahara et al., 2008), thus we can try their method. Also, CFS propose a language-independent unsupervised method. These could be of help.","At any rate, our idiom corpus will play an important role in the development of unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, and the experimental results obtained in this study will be a good reference point to evaluate those methods."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was conducted as a part of the collaborative research project of Kyoto University and NTT Communication Science Laboratories.","The work was supported from NTT Communication Science Laboratories and JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) 19700141.","We would like to thank the members of the collaborative research group of Kyoto University and NTT Communication Science Laboratories and Francis Bond for their stimulating discussion.
