Phrasal and hierarchical systems can only insert or delete words in the context of a larger phrase or rule. While this may suffice when translating in-domain, it performs poorly when trying to translate broad domains such as web text. Various syntactic approaches have been proposed that begin to address this problem by learning lexicalized and unlexicalized rules. Among these, the treelet approach uses unlexicalized order templates to model ordering separately from lexical choice. We introduce an extension to the latter that allows for structural word insertion and deletion, without requiring a lexical anchor, and show that it produces gains of more than 1.0% BLEU over both phrasal and baseline treelet systems on broad domain text."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Among the phenomena that are modeled poorly by modern SMT systems is the insertion and deletion of words, such as function words, that are motivated by the divergent linguistic structure between source and target language. To take the simplest of examples, the English noun compound “file name” would typically be translated into Spanish as “nombre de archivo”, which requires the insertion of the preposition “de”. Conversely, when translating from Spanish to English, the “de” must be deleted. At first glance, the problem may seem trivial, yet the presence and position of these function words can have crucial impact on the adequacy and fluency of translation.","In particular, function words are often used to denote key semantic information. They may be used to denote case information, in languages such as Japanese. Failing to insert the proper case marker may render a sentence unreadable or significantly change its meaning. Learning these operations can be tricky for MT models best suited to contiguous word sequences. From a fluency standpoint, proper insertion of determiners and prepositions can often make the difference between laughably awkward output and natural sounding translations; consider the output “it’s a cake piece” as opposed to “it’s a piece of cake”.","Furthermore, since missing or spurious function words can confuse the target language model, handling these words properly can have an impact beyond the words themselves.","This paper focuses on methods of inserting and deleting words based on syntactic cues, to be used in the context of a syntax-informed translation system. While the models we build are relatively simple and the underlying templates are easy to extract, they add significant generalization ability to the base translation system, and result in significant gains."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["As a motivating example, let us return to the English/Spanish pair “file name” and “nombre de archivo”. In principle, we would want a machine translation system to be capable of learning the following general transformation:  “ NOUN1 NOUN2” “ NOUN2 de NOUN1” (1) Yet even this simple example is beyond the capabilities of many common approaches.","The heavily lexicalized approaches of phrasal systems (Koehn et al., 2003), are inherently incapable of this generalization. As a proxy, they 735 acquire phrase pairs such as “nombre de archivo” “file name”, “nombre de” “name” and “de archivo” “file”. Note that the inserted word is attached to adjacent context word(s). When the test set vocabulary has significant overlap with the training vocabulary, the correct translation can often be assembled based on the head or the modifying noun. However, as we show in this paper, this is woefully inadequate when translating truly out-of-domain input.","In principle, phrase-based translation systems may employ insertion phrase pairs such as  “[NULL]” “de” (2) but the ungrounded nature of this transformation makes its use during decoding difficult. Since there are no constraints on where such a rule may apply and the rule does not consume any input words, the decoder must attempt these rules at every point in the search.","The reverse operation  “de” “[NULL]” (3) is more feasible to implement, though again, there is great ambiguity – a source word may be deleted at any point during the search, with identical target results. Few systems allow this operation in practice. Estimating the likelihood of this operation and correctly identifying the contexts in which it should occur remain challenging problems.","Hierarchical systems, such as (Chiang, 2005) in principle have the capacity to learn insertions and deletions grounded by minimal lexical cues. However, the extracted rules use a single nonterminal. Hence, to avoid explosive ambiguity, they are constrained to contain at least one aligned pair of words. This restriction successfully limits computational complexity at a cost of generalization power.","Syntax-based approaches provide fertile context for grounding insertions and deletions. Often we may draw a strong correspondence between function words in one language and syntactic constructions in another. For instance, the syntactic approach of Marcu et al. (2006) can learn unlexicalized rules that insert function words in isolation, such as:  NP(NN:x0 NN:x1) x1 de x0 (4)","However, as discussed in (Wang, Knight & Marcu, 2007), joint modeling of structure and lexical choice can exacerbate data sparsity, a problem that they attempt to address by tree binarization. Nevertheless, as we show below, unlexicalized structural transformation rules such as (1) and (4) that allow for insertion of isolated function words, are essential for good quality translation of truly out-of-domain test data.","In the treelet translation approach (Menezes & Quirk, 2007), lexical choice and syntactic reordering are modeled separately using lexicalized treelets and unlexicalized order templates. We discuss this approach in more detail in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe how we extend this approach to allow for structural insertion and deletion, without the need for content word anchors."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["There is surprisingly little prior work in this area. We previously (Menezes & Quirk, 2005) explored the use of deletion operations such as (3) above, but these were not grounded in any syntactic context, and the estimation was somewhat heuristic1",".","The tuple translation model of Crego et al. (2005), a joint model over source and target translations, also provides a means of deleting words. In training, sentence pairs such as “nombre de archivo” / “file name” are first word aligned, then minimal bilingual tuples are identified, such as “nombre / name”, “de / NULL” and “archivo / file”. The tuples may involve deletion of words by allowing an empty target side, but do not allow insertion tuples with an empty source side. These inserted words are bound to an adjacent neighbor. An n-gram model is trained over the tuple sequences. As a result, deletion probabilities have the desirable property of being conditioned on adjacent context, yet this context is heavily lexicalized, therefore unlikely to generalize well.","More recently, Li et. al. (2008) describe three models for handling “single word deletion” (they discuss, but do not address, word insertion). The first model uses a fixed probability of deletion                                                            1 We assigned channel probabilities based on the sum of the Model1 probability of the source word being aligned to NULL or one of a list of \"garbage collector\" words. This exploits the property of Model1 that certain high-frequency words tend to act as \"garbage collectors\" for words that should remain unaligned. 736 P(NULL), independent of the source word, estimated by counting null alignments in the training corpus. The second model estimates a deletion probability per-word, P(NULL|w), also directly from the aligned corpus, and the third model trains an SVM to predict the probability of deletion given source language context (neighboring and dependency tree-adjacent words and parts-of-speech). All three models give large gains of 1.5% BLEU or more on Chinese-English translation. It is interesting to note that the more sophisticated models provide a relatively small improvement over the simplest model in-domain, and no benefit out-of-domain."]},{"title":"4 Dependency treelet translation","paragraphs":["As a baseline, we use the treelet translation approach (which we previously described in Menezes & Quirk, 2007), a linguistically syntax-based system leveraging a source parser. It first unifies lexicalized treelets and unlexicalized templates to construct a sentence-specific set of synchronous rewrite rules. It then finds the highest scoring derivation according to a linear combination of models. We briefly review this system before describing our current extension. 4.1 The treelet translation model Sentence-specific rewrite rules are constructed by unifying information from three sources: a dependency parse of the input sentence, a set of treelet translation pairs, and a set of unlexicalized order templates. Dependency parses are represented as trees: each node has a lexical label and a part of speech, as well as ordered lists of pre-and post-modifiers.","A treelet represents a connected subgraph of a dependency tree; treelet translation pairs consist of source and target treelets and a node alignment. This alignment is represented by indices: each node is annotated with an integer alignment index. A source node and a target node are aligned iff they have the same alignment index. For instance:  ((old1/JJ) man2/NN) (hombre2 (viejo1)) (5)  (man1/NN) (hombre1) (6)","Order templates are unlexicalized transduction rules that describe the reorderings, insertions and deletions associated with a single group of nodes that are aligned together. For instance:  ((x0: /DT) (x1: /JJ) 1/NN) ((x0) 1 (x1)) (7)  ((x0: /DT) (x1: /JJ) 1/NN) ((x0) (x1) 1) (8)  ((x0: /DT) 1/NN) ((x0) 1) (9)  ((x0: /RB) 1/JJ) ((x0) 1) (10)","Each node is either a placeholder or a variable. Placeholders, such as 1/NN on the source side or 1 on the target side, have alignment indices and constraints on their parts-of-speech on the source side, but are unconstrained lexically (represented by the ). These unify at translation time with lexicalized treelet nodes with matching parts-of-speech and alignment.","Variables, such as x0: /DT on the source side and x0: on the target side, also have parts-of-speech constraints on the source side. Variables are used to indicate where rewrite rules are recursively applied to translate subtrees. Thus each variable label such as x0, must occur exactly once on each side.","In effect, a template specifies how all the children of a given source node are reordered during translation. If translation were a word-replacement task, then templates would be just simple, single-level tree transducers. However, in the presence of one-to-many and many-to-one translations and unaligned words, templates may span multiple levels in the tree.","As an example, order template (7) indicates that an NN with two pre-modifying subtrees headed by DT and JJ may be translated by using a single word translation of the NN, placing the translation of the DT subtree as a pre-modifier, and placing the translation of the JJ subtree as a post-modifier. As discussed below, this template can unify with the treelet (6) to produce the following rewrite rule:  ((x0:DT) (x1:JJ) man/NN)   ((x0) hombre (x1)) (11)","Matching: A treelet translation pair matches an input parse iff there is a unique correspondence between the source side of the treelet pair and a connected subgraph of the input parse.","An order template matches an input parse iff there is a unique correspondence between the source side of the template and the input parse, with the additional restriction that all children of input nodes that correspond to placeholder 737 template nodes must be included in the correspondence. For instance, order template (7) matches the parse  ((the/DT) (young/JJ) colt/NN) (12) but not the parse  ((the/DT) (old/JJ) (grey/JJ) mare/NN) (13)","Finally, an order template matches a treelet translation pair at a given node iff, on both source and target sides, there is a correspondence between the treelet translation nodes and template nodes that is consistent with their tree structure and alignments. Furthermore, all placeholder nodes in the template must correspond to some treelet node.","Constructing a sentence-specific rewrite rule is then a process of unifying each treelet with a matching combination of order templates with respect to an input parse. Each treelet node must be unified with one and only one order template placeholder node. Unifying under these constraints produces a rewrite rule that has a one-to-one correspondence between variables in source and target. For instance, given the input parse:  ((the/DT) ((very/RB) old/JJ) man/NN) (14) we can create a rewrite rule from the treelet translation pair (5) by unifying it with the order template (7), which matches at the node man and its descendents, and template (10), which matches at the node old, to produce the following sentence-specific rewrite rule:  ((the/DT) ((x1: /RB) old/JJ) man/NN)   ((el) hombre ((x1) viejo)) (15)","Note that by using different combinations of order templates, a single treelet can produce multiple rewrite rules. Also, note how treelet translation pairs capture contextual lexical translations but are underspecified with respect to ordering, while order templates separately capture arbitrary reordering phenomena yet are underspecified lexically. Keeping lexical and ordering information orthogonal until runtime allows for the production of novel transduction rules never actually seen in the training corpus, leading to improved generalization power.","Decoding: Given a set of sentence-specific rewrite rules, a standard beam search algorithm is used to find the highest scoring derivation. Derivations are scored according to a linear combination of models. 4.2 Training The process of extracting treelet translation pairs and order templates begins with parallel sentences. First, the sentence pairs are word segmented on both sides, and the source language sentences are parsed. Next, the sentence pairs are word aligned and the alignments are used to project a target language dependency tree.","Treelet extraction: From each sentence pair , with the alignment relation ~ , a treelet translation pair consisting of the source treelet and the target treelet is extracted iff: (1) There exist and such that ~ . (2) For all , and such that ~ , iff",".","Order template extraction is attempted starting from each node Sroot in the source whose parent is not also aligned to the same target word(s). We identify Troot, the highest target node aligned to Sroot. We initialize the sets S0 as {Sroot} and T0 as {Troot}. We expand S0 to include all nodes adjacent to some element of S0 that are (a) unaligned, or (b) aligned to some node in T0. The converse is applied to T0. This expansion is repeated until we reach a fixed point. Together, S0 and T0 make up the placeholder nodes in the extracted order template. We then create one variable in the order template for each direct child of nodes in S0 and T0 that is not already included in the order template. Iff there is a one-to-one word alignment correspondence between source and target variables, then a template is extracted. This restriction leads to clean templates, at the cost of excluding all templates involving extraposition."]},{"title":"5 Insertion/deletion order templates","paragraphs":["In this paper, we extend our previous work to allow for insertion and deletion of words, by allowing unaligned lexical items as part of the otherwise unlexicalized order templates. Grounding insertions and deletions in templates rather than treelets has two major benefits. First, insertion and deletion can be performed even in the absence of specific lexical context, leading to greater generalization power. Secondly, this increased power is tempered by linguistically 738 informative unlexicalized context. Rather than proposing insertions and deletions in any arbitrary setting, we are guided by specific syntactic phenomena. For instance, when translating English noun compounds into Spanish, we often must include a preposition; this generalization is naturally captured using just parts-of-speech.","The inclusion of lexical items in order templates affects the translation system in only a few places: dependency tree projection, order template extraction, and rewrite rule construction at runtime.","Dependency tree projection: During this step of the baseline treelet system, unaligned words are by default attached low, to the lowest aligned neighbor. Although this worked well in conjunction with the discriminative order model, it prevents unaligned nodes from conditioning on relevant context in order templates. Therefore, we change the default attachment of unaligned nodes to be to the highest aligned neighbor; informal experiments showed that this did not noticeably impact translation quality in the baseline system. For example, consider the source parse and aligned target sentence:  ((calibrated1/JJ) (camera2/NN) file3/NN)  archivo3 de4 cámara2 calibrado1 (16) Using the baseline projection algorithm would produce this target dependency tree:  (archivo3 ((de4) cámara2) (calibrado1)) (17) Instead, we attach unaligned words high:  (archivo3 (de4) (cámara2) (calibrado1)) (18)","Order template extraction: In addition to the purely unlexicalized templates extracted from each training sentence, we also allow templates that include lexical items for each unaligned token. For each point in the original extraction procedure, where S0 or T0 contain unaligned nodes, we now extract two templates: The original unlexicalized template, and a new template in which only the unaligned node(s) contain the specific lexical item(s). From the example sentence pair (16), using the projected parse (18) we would extract the following two templates:  ((x0: /JJ) (x1: /NN) 1/NN)   ( 1 ( 2) (x1) (x0)) (19)  ((x0: /JJ) (x1: /NN) 1/NN)   ( 1 (de2) (x1) (x0)) (20)","Template matching and unification: We extend the template matching against the input parse to require that any lexicalized source template nodes match the input exactly. When matching templates to treelet translation pairs, any unaligned treelet nodes must be consistent with the corresponding template node (i.e. the template node must be unlexicalized, or the lexical items must match). On the other hand, lexicalized template nodes do not need to match any treelet nodes -- insertions or deletions may now come from the template alone.","Consider the following example input parse:  ((digital/JJ) (camera/NN)  (file/NN) extension/NN) (21) The following treelet translation pair provides a contextual translation for some of the children, including the insertion of one necessary preposition:  ((file1/NN) extension2/NN)       (extension2 (de3) (archivo1)) (22) The following order template can provide relative ordering information between nodes as well as insert the remaining prepositions:  ((x0: /JJ) (x1: /NN) (x2: /NN) 1/NN)      ( 1 (de2) (x2) (de3) (x0) (x1)) (23) The unification of this template and treelet is somewhat complex: the first inserted de is agreed upon by both template and treelet, whereas the second is inserted by the template alone. This results in the following novel rewrite rule:  ((x0: /JJ) (x1: /NN) (file) extension)      (extension (de) (archivo) (de) (x0) (x1)) (24) These relatively minimal changes produce a powerful contextualized model of insertion and deletion.","Parameter estimation: The underlying treelet system includes a template probability estimated by relative frequency. We estimate our lexicalized templates in the same way. However early experiments showed that this feature alone was not enough to allow even common insertions, since the probability of even the most common insertion templates is much lower than that of unlexicalized templates. To improve the modeling capability, we included two additional feature functions: a count of structurally inserted words, and a count of structurally deleted words. 739"]},{"title":"6 Example","paragraphs":["Consider the following English test sentence and corresponding Spanish human translation: September is National Cholesterol Education Month Septiembre es el Mes Nacional para la Educación sobre el Colesterol The baseline treelet system without structural insertions translates this sentence as: Septiembre es Nacional Colesterol Educación Mes Not only is the translation missing the appropriate articles and prepositions, but also in their absence, it fails to reorder the content words correctly. Without the missing prepositions, the language model does not show a strong preference among various orderings of \"nacional\" \"colesterol\" \"educación\" and \"mes\".","Using structural insertion templates, the highest scoring translation of the sentence is now: Septiembre es el Mes Nacional de Educación de colesterol Although the choice of prepositions is not the same as the reference, the fluency is much improved and the translation is quite understandable.

For the purposes of these experiments, we used a dependency tree output with part-of-speech tags and unstemmed, case-normalized surface words. For word alignment we used a training regimen of five iterations of Model 1, followed by five iterations of a word-dependent HMM model (He, 2007) in both directions. The forward and backward alignments were combined using a dependency tree-based heuristic combination. The word alignments and English dependency tree were used to project a target tree. From the aligned tree pairs we extracted treelet and order template tables.","For the Europarl systems, we use a phrase/treelet size of 7 and train model weights using 2000 sentences of Europarl data.

In this language pair, both insertions and deletions have an impact, for a total gain of 1.1% BLEU over the baseline treelet system, and 3.6% over the phrasal system. To aid our understanding of the system, we tabulated the most commonly inserted and deleted words when translating from English into Japanese in Tables 8.2 and 8.3 respectively. Satisfyingly, most of the insertions and deletions correspond to well-known structural differences between the languages. For instance, in English the thematic role of a noun phrase, such as subject or object, is typically indicated by word order, whereas Japanese uses case markers to express this information. Hence, case markers such as “ ” and “ ” need to be inserted. Also, when noun compounds are translated, an intervening postposition such as “ ” is usually needed. Among the most common deletions are “the” and “a”. This is because Japanese does not have a notion of definiteness. Similarly, pronouns are often dropped in Japanese.","English-Spanish: We note, in Table 8.4 that even between such closely related languages, structural insertions give us noticeable improvements over the baseline treelet system. On the smaller Europarl training corpus the improvements range from 0.5% to 1.1% BLEU.

Nevertheless, the web test results indicate that if one hopes to handle truly general input the need for structural generalizations remains.","Unlike in English-Japanese, when translating from English to Spanish, structural deletions are less helpful. Used in isolation or in combination with insertion templates they have a slightly negative and/or insignificant impact in all cases. We hypothesize that when translating from English into Spanish, more words need to be inserted than deleted. Conversely, when translating in the reverse direction, deletion templates may play a bigger role. We were unable to test the reverse direction because our syntax-based systems depend on a source language parser. In future work we hope to address this.  % BLEU Phrasal 13.41 Baseline treelet 15.89 +Deletion only 16.00 +Insertion only 16.16 +Deletion and Insertion 17.01 Table 8.1: English-Japanese system comparisons Word Count %age Type   2844 42% Postposition   1637 24% Postposition/case marker   630 9.3% Postposition/case marker   517 7.6% Punctuation   476 7.0% Postposition    266 3.9% Light verb   101 1.5% Postposition   68 1.0% Postposition    27 0.40% Light verb   26 0.38% Punctuation   19 0.28% Question marker Table 8.2: E-J: Most commonly inserted words Word Count %age Type the 875 59% Definite article - 159 11% Punctuation a 113 7.7% Indefinite article you 53 3.6% Pronoun it 53 3.6% Pronoun that 26 1.8% Conjunction, Pronoun \" 23 1.6% Punctuation in 16 1.1% Preposition . 10 0.68% Punctuation 's 10 0.68% Possessive I 9 0.61% Pronoun Table 8.3: E-J: Most commonly deleted words  742","In table 8.5 and 8.6, we list the words most commonly inserted and deleted when translating the web test using the general English-Spanish system.
