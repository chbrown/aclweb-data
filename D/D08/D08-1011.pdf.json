Recently, confusion-network-based system combination algorithms have been developed to combine outputs of multiple machine translation (MT) systems to form a consensus output (Bangalore, et al. 2001, Matusov et al., 2006, Rosti et al., 2007, Sim et al., 2007). A confusion network comprises a sequence of sets of alternative words, possibly including null’s, with associated scores. The consensus output is then derived by selecting one word from each set of alternatives, to produce the sequence with the best overall score, which could be assigned in various ways such as by voting, by  * Mei Yang performed this work when she was an intern with Microsoft Research. using posterior probability estimates, or by using a combination of these measures and other features.","Constructing a confusion network requires choosing one of the hypotheses as the backbone (also called “skeleton” in the literature), and other hypotheses are aligned to it at the word level. High quality hypothesis alignment is crucial to the performance of the resulting system combination. However, there are two challenging issues that make MT hypothesis alignment difficult. First, different hypotheses may use different synonymous words to express the same meaning, and these synonyms need to be aligned to each other. Second, correct translations may have different word orderings in different hypotheses and these words need to be properly reordered in hypothesis alignment.","In this paper, we propose an indirect hidden Markov model (IHMM) for MT hypothesis alignment. The HMM provides a way to model both synonym matching and word ordering. Unlike traditional HMMs whose parameters are trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the parameters of the IHMM are estimated indirectly from a variety of sources including word semantic similarity, word surface similarity, and a distance-based distortion penalty, without using large amount of training data.

Then in Fig. 1 (b), one of the hypotheses is selected as the backbone for hypothesis alignment. This is usually done by a sentence-level minimum Bayes risk (MBR) method which selects a hypothesis that has the minimum average distance compared to all hypotheses. The backbone determines the word order of the combined output. Then as illustrated in Fig. 1 (c), all other hypotheses are aligned to the backbone. Note that in Fig. 1 (c) the symbol ε denotes a null word, which is inserted by the alignment normalization algorithm described in section 3.4.

Matusov et al. (2006) proposed using GIZA++ to align words between different MT hypotheses, where all hypotheses of the test corpus are collected to create hypothesis pairs for GIZA++ training. This approach uses the conventional HMM model bootstrapped from IBM Model-1 as implemented in GIZA++, and heuristically combines results from aligning in both directions. System combination based on this approach gives an improvement over the best single system. However, the number of hypothesis pairs for training is limited by the size of the test corpus. Also, MT hypotheses from the same source sentence are correlated with each other and these hypothesis pairs are not i.i.d. data samples. Therefore, GIZA++ training on such a data set may be unreliable.","Bangalore et al. (2001) used a multiple string-matching algorithm based on Levenshtein edit distance, and later Sim et al. (2007) and Rosti et al. (2007) extended it to a TER-based method for hypothesis alignment. TER (Snover et al., 2006)  3 This only happens if no hypothesis word is aligned to a backbone word but some hypothesis words are aligned to the null associated with that backbone word. measures the minimum number of edits, including substitution, insertion, deletion, and shift of blocks of words, that are needed to modify a hypothesis so that it exactly matches the other hypothesis. The best alignment is the one that gives the minimum number of translation edits. TER-based confusion network construction and system combination has demonstrated superior performance on various large-scale MT tasks (Rosti. et al, 2007). However, when searching for the optimal alignment, the TER-based method uses a strict surface hard match for counting edits. Therefore, it is not able to handle synonym matching well. Moreover, although TER-based alignment allows phrase shifts to accommodate the non-monotonic word ordering, all non-monotonic shifts are penalized equally no matter how short or how long the move is, and this penalty is set to be the same as that for substitution, deletion, and insertion edits. Therefore, its modeling of non-monotonic word ordering is very coarse-grained.","In contrast to the GIZA++-based method, our IHMM-based method has a similarity model estimated using bilingual word alignment HMMs that are trained on a large amount of bi-text data. Moreover, the surface similarity information is explicitly incorporated in our model, while it is only used implicitly via parameter initialization for IBM Model-1 training by Matusov et al. (2006). On the other hand, the TER-based alignment model is similar to a coarse-grained, nonnormalized version of our IHMM, in which the similarity model assigns no penalty to an exact surface match and a fixed penalty to all substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and the distortion model simply assigns no penalty to a monotonic jump, and a fixed penalty to all other jumps, equal to the non-exact-match penalty in the similarity model.","There have been other hypothesis alignment methods. Karakos, et al. (2008) proposed an ITG-based method for hypothesis alignment, Rosti et al. (2008) proposed an incremental alignment method, and a heuristic-based matching algorithm was proposed by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005)."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section, we evaluate our IHMM-based hypothesis alignment method on the Chinese-to-English (C2E) test in the constrained training track 102  of the 2008 NIST Open MT Evaluation (NIST, 2008). We compare to the TER-based method used by Rosti et al. (2007). In the following experiments, the NIST BLEU score is used as the evaluation metric (Papineni et al., 2002), which is reported as a percentage in the following sections.  5.1 Implementation details  In our implementation, the backbone is selected with MBR. Only the top hypothesis from each single system is considered as a backbone. A uniform posteriori probability is assigned to all hypotheses. TER is used as loss function in the MBR computation.","Similar to (Rosti et al., 2007), each word in the confusion network is associated with a word posterior probability. Given a system S, each of its hypotheses is assigned with a rank-based score of 1/(1+r) η",", where r is the rank of the hypothesis, and η is a rank smoothing parameter. The system specific rank-based score of a word w for a given system S is the sum of all the rank-based scores of the hypotheses in system S that contain the word w at the given position (after hypothesis alignment). This score is then normalized by the sum of the scores of all the alternative words at the same position and from the same system S to generate the system specific word posterior. Then, the total word posterior of w over all systems is a sum of these system specific posteriors weighted by system weights.","Beside the word posteriors, we use language model scores and a word count as features for confusion network decoding.","Therefore, for an M-way system combination that uses N LMs, a total of M+N+1 decoding parameters, including M-1 system weights, one rank smoothing factor, N language model weights, and one weight for the word count feature, are optimized using Powell’s method (Brent, 1973) to maximize BLEU score on a development set","4",".","Two language models are used in our experiments. One is a trigram model estimated from the English side of the parallel training data, and the other is a 5-gram model trained on the English GigaWord corpus from LDC using the MSRLM toolkit (Nguyen et al, 2007).  4 The parameters of IHMM are not tuned by maximum-BLEU training.","In order to reduce the fluctuation of BLEU scores caused by the inconsistent translation output length, an unsupervised length adaptation method has been devised. We compute an expected length ratio between the MT output and the source sentences on the development set after maximum-BLEU training. Then during test, we adapt the length of the translation output by adjusting the weight of the word count feature such that the expected output/source length ratio is met. In our experiments, we apply length adaptation to the system combination output at the level of the whole test corpus.  5.2 Development and test data  The development (dev) set used for system combination parameter training contains 1002 sentences sampled from the previous NIST MT Chinese-to-English test sets: 35% from MT04, 55% from MT05, and 10% from MT06-newswire. The test set is the MT08 Chinese-to-English “current” test set, which includes 1357 sentences from both newswire and web-data genres. Both dev and test sets have four references per sentence.","As inputs to the system combination, 10-best hypotheses for each source sentence in the dev and test sets are collected from each of the eight single systems. All outputs on the MT08 test set were true-cased before scoring using a log-linear conditional Markov model proposed by Toutanova et al. (2008). However, to save computation effort, the results on the dev set are reported in case insensitive BLEU (ciBLEU) score instead."," 5.3 Experimental results"," In our main experiments, outputs from a total of eight single MT systems were combined. As listed in Table 1, Sys-1 is a tree-to-string system proposed by Quirk et al., (2005); Sys-2 is a phrase-based system with fast pruning proposed by Moore and Quirk (2008); Sys-3 is a phrase-based system with syntactic source reordering proposed by Wang et al. (2007a); Sys-4 is a syntax-based pre-ordering system proposed by Li et. al. (2007); Sys-5 is a hierarchical system proposed by Chiang (2007); Sys-6 is a lexicalized re-ordering system proposed by Xiong et al. (2006); Sys-7 is a two-pass phrase-based system with adapted LM proposed by Foster and Kuhn (2007); and Sys-8 is 103  a hierarchical system with two-pass rescoring using a parser-based LM proposed by Wang et al., (2007b). All systems were trained within the confines of the constrained training condition of NIST MT08 evaluation. These single systems are optimized with maximum-BLEU training on different subsets of the previous NIST MT test data. The bilingual translation models used to compute the semantic similarity are from the word-dependent HMMs proposed by He (2007), which are trained on two million parallel sentence-pairs selected from the training corpus allowed by the constrained training condition of MT08.  5.3.1 Comparison with TER alignment","In the IHMM-based method, the smoothing factor for surface similarity model is set to ρ = 3, the interpolation factor of the overall similarity model is set to α = 0.3, and the controlling factor of the distance-based distortion parameters is set to K=2. These settings are optimized on the dev set. Individual system results and system combination results using both IHMM and TER alignment, on both the dev and test sets, are presented in Table 1. The TER-based hypothesis alignment tool used in our experiments is the publicly available TER Java program, TERCOM (Snover et al., 2006). Default settings of TERCOM are used in the following experiments.","On the dev set, the case insensitive BLEU score of the IHMM-based 8-way system combination output is about 5.8 points higher than that of the best single system.

It outperformed the best single system by 4.7 BLEU points and the TER-based system combination by 1.0 BLEU points. Note that the best single system on the dev set and the test set are different. The different single systems are optimized on different tuning sets, so this discrepancy between dev set and test set results is presumably due to differing degrees of mismatch between the dev and test sets and the various tuning sets.","","","","  Table 1.

Each group receives a total system weight mass of 1/3. Then the weight mass is further divided in each group: in the first group, the original weights of systems 1~8 are multiplied by 1/3; in the second and third groups, the weight mass is evenly distributed within the group, i.e., 1/12 for each system in group 2, and 1/9 for each 104  system in group 3","5",". Length adaptation is applied to control the final output length, where the same expected length ratio of the previous 8-way system combination is adopted.","The results of the 15-way system combination are presented in Table 3. It shows that the IHMM-based method is still about 1 BLEU point better than the TER-based method. Moreover, combining 15 single systems gives an output that has a NIST BLEU score of 34.82%, which is 3.9 points better than the best submission to the NIST MT08 constrained training track (NIST, 2008).

The accuracy is significantly improved to 43.62% on the dev set and 30.89% on test set when α = 0.3. In another extreme case, α =  5 This is just a rough guess because no dev set is available. We believe a better set of system weights could be obtained if MT outputs on a common dev set were available. 0, in which only the surface similarity model is used for the overall similarity model, the performance degrades by about 0.2 point.

In this paper, an IHMM-based method is proposed for hypothesis alignment. It uses a similarity model for synonym matching and a distortion model for word ordering. In contrast to previous methods, the similarity model explicitly incorporates both semantic and surface word similarity, which is critical to monolingual word alignment, and a smoothed distance-based distortion model is used to model the first-order dependency of word ordering, which is shown to be better than simpler approaches. 105 ","Our experimental results show that the IHMM-based hypothesis alignment method gave superior results on the NIST MT08 C2E test set compared to the TER-based method. Moreover, we show that our system combination method can scale up to combining more systems and produce a better output that has a case sensitive BLEU score of 34.82, which is 3.9 BLEU points better than the best official submission of MT08."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The authors are grateful to Chris Quirk, Arul Menezes, Kristina Toutanova, William Dolan, Mu Li, Chi-Ho Li, Dongdong Zhang, Long Jiang, Ming Zhou, George Foster, Roland Kuhn, Jing Zheng, Wen Wang, Necip Fazil Ayan, Dimitra Vergyri, Nicolas Scheffer, Andreas Stolcke, Kevin Knight, Jens-Soenke Voeckler, Spyros Matsoukas, and Antti-Veikko Rosti for assistance with the MT systems and/or for the valuable suggestions and discussions.",""]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Srinivas Bangalore, German Bordel, and Giuseppe Riccardi. 2001.
