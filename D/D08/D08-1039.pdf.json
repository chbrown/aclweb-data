Starting from single-word-based translation approaches, significant improvements have been made through advances in modeling, availability of larger corpora and more powerful computers. Thus, substantial progress made in the past enables today’s MT systems to achieve acceptable results in terms of translation quality for specific language pairs such as Arabic-English. If sufficient amounts of parallel data are available, statistical MT systems can be trained on millions of","∗","The work was carried out while the author was at the Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition group at RWTH Aachen University and partly supported by the Valencian Conselleria d’Empresa, Universitat i Ciència under grants CTBPRA/2005/ and BEFPI/2007/014. target source e e′ f Figure 1: Triplet example: a source word f is triggered by two target words e and e′",", where one of the words is within and the other outside the considered phrase pair (indicated by the dashed line). sentence pairs and use an extended level of context based on bilingual groups of words which denote the building blocks of state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems.","Due to data sparseness, statistical models are often trained on local context only. Language models are derived from n-grams with n ≤ 5 and bilingual phrase pairs are extracted with lengths up to 10 words on the target side. This captures the local dependencies of the data in detail and is responsible for the success of data-driven phrase-based approaches.","In this work, we will introduce a new statistical model based on lexicalized triplets (f, e, e′",") which we will also refer to as cross-lingual triggers of the form (e, e′","→ f ). This can be understood as two words in one language triggering one word in another language. These triplets, modeled by p(f |e, e′","), are closely related to lexical translation probabilities based on the IBM model 1, i.e. p(f |e). Several constraints and setups will be described later on in more detail, but as an introduction one can 372 think of the following interpretation which is depicted in Figure 1: Using a phrase-based MT approach, a source word f is triggered by its translation e which is part of the phrase being considered, whereas another target word e′","outside this phrase serves as an additional trigger in order to allow for more fine-grained distinction of a specific word sense. Thus, this cross-lingual trigger model can be seen as a combination of a lexicon model (i.e. f and e) and a model similar to monolingual long-range (i.e. distant bigram) trigger models (i.e. e and e′ , although these dependencies are reflected indirectly via e′","→ f ) which uses both local (in-phrase) and global (in-sentence) information for the scoring. The motivation behind this approach is to get non-local information outside the current context (i.e. the currently considered bilingual phrase pair) into the translation process. The triplets are trained via the EM algorithm, as will be shown later in more detail."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In the past, a significant number of methods has been presented that try to capture long-distance dependencies, i.e. use dependencies in the data that reach beyond the local context of n-grams or phrase pairs. In language modeling, monolingual trigger approaches have been presented (Rosenfeld, 1996; Tillmann and Ney, 1997) as well as syntactical methods that parse the input and model long-range dependencies on the syntactic level by conditioning on the predecessing words and their corresponding parent nodes (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Roark, 2001). The latter approach was shown to reduce perplexities and improve the WER in speech recognition systems. One drawback is that the parsing process might slow down the system significantly and the approach is complicated to be integrated directly in the search process. Thus, the effect is often shown offline in reranking experiments using n-best lists.","One of the simplest models that can be seen in the context of lexical triggers is the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) which captures lexical dependencies between source and target words. It can be seen as a lexicon containing correspondents of translations of source and target words in a very broad sense since the pairs are trained on the full sentence level. The model presented in this work is very close to the initial IBM model 1 and can be seen as taking another word into the conditioning part, i.e. the triggering items.1","Furthermore, since the second trigger can come from any part of the sentence, we also have a link to long-range monolingual triggers as presented above.","A long-range trigram model is presented in (Della Pietra et al., 1994) where it is shown how to derive a probabilistic link grammar in order to capture long-range dependencies in English using the EM algorithm. Expectation-Maximization is used in the presented triplet model as well which is described in more detail in Section 3. Instead of deriv-ing a grammar automatically (based on POS tags of the words), we rely on a fully lexicalized approach, i.e. the training is taking place at the word level.","Related work in the context of fine-tuning language models by using cross-lingual lexical triggers is presented in (Kim and Khudanpur, 2003). The authors show how to use cross-lingual triggers on a document level in order to extract translation lexicons and domain-specific language models using a mutual information criterion.","Recently, word-sense disambiguation (WSD) methods have been shown to improve translation quality (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007). Chan et al. (2007) use an SVM based classifier for disambiguating word senses which are directly in-corporated in the decoder through additional features that are part of the log-linear combination of models. They use local collocations based on surrounding words left and right of an ambiguous word including the corresponding parts-of-speech. Although no long-range dependencies are modeled, the approach yields an improvement of +0.6% BLEU on the NIST Chinese-English task. In Carpuat and Wu (2007), another state-of-the-art WSD engine (a combination of naive Bayes, maximum entropy, boost-ing and Kernel PCA models) is used to dynamically determine the score of a phrase pair under consideration and, thus, let the phrase selection adapt to the context of the sentence. Although the baseline is significantly lower than in the work of Chan et al., this setup reaches an improvement of 0.5% BLEU on the NIST CE task and up to 1.1% BLEU on the 1 Thus, instead of p(f|e) we model p(f|e, e′",") with different","additional constraints as explained later on. 373 IWSLT’06 test sets.","The work in this paper tries to complement the WSD approaches by using long-range dependencies. If triggers from a local context determine different lexical choice for the word being triggered, the setting is comparable to the mentioned WSD approaches (although local dependencies might already be reflected sufficiently in the phrase models). A distant second trigger, however, might have a beneficial effect for specific languages, e.g. by captur-ing word splits (as it is the case in German for verbs with separable prefixes) or, as already mentioned, allowing for a more fine-grained lexical choice of the word being triggered, namely based on another word which is not part of the current local, i.e. phrasal, context.","The basic idea of triplets of the form (e, f ′","→ f ), called multi-word extensions, is also mentioned in (Tillmann, 2001) but neither evaluated nor investigated in further detail.","In the following sections, we will describe the model proposed in this work. In Section 3, a detailed introduction is given, as well as the EM training and variations of the model. The different set-tings will be evaluated in Section 4, where we show experiments on the IWSLT Chinese-English and TC-STAR EPPS English-Spanish/Spanish-English tracks. A discussion of the results and further examples are given in Section 5. Final remarks and future work are addressed in Section 6."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["As an extension to commonly used lexical word pair probabilities p(f |e) as introduced in (Brown et al., 1993), we define our model to operate on word triplets.

Here, μ stands for the entire set of model parameters to be estimated, i.e. the set of all {α(f |e, e′",")}.

The former reduces the number of possible triplets by posing constraints on the position of where valid triggers may originate from. In order to obtain phrase boundaries on the training data, we use forced alignments, i.e. translate the whole training data by constraining the translation hypotheses to the target sentences of the training corpus.","Path-aligned triplets use an alignment constraint from the word alignments that are trained with GIZA++.

We show the effect of the empty word in the experiments (Section 4). Furthermore, we can train the presented models in the inverse direction, i.e. p(e|f, f ′","), and combine the two directions in the rescoring framework. The next section presents a set of experiments that evaluate the performance of the presented triplet model and its variations."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the system setup used in this work, including the translation tasks and the corresponding training corpora. The experiments are based on an n-best list reranking framework. 375 4.1 System The experiments were carried out using a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system. The dynamic programming beam search decoder uses several models during decoding by combining them loglinearly. We incorporate phrase translation and word lexicon models in both directions, a language model, as well as phrase and word penalties including a distortion model for the reordering. While generating the hypotheses, a word graph is created which compactly represents the most likely translation hypotheses. Out of this word graph, we generate n-best lists and use them to test the different setups as described in Section 3.","In the experiments, we use 10,000-best lists containing unique translation hypotheses, i.e. duplicates generated due to different phrase segmentations are reduced to one single entry. The advantage of this reranking approach is that we can directly test the obtained models since we already have fully generated translations. Thus, we can apply the triplet lexicon model based on p(f |e, e′",") and its inverse counterpart p(e|f, f ′",") directly. During decoding, since e′ could be from anywhere outside the current phrase, i.e. even from a part which lies beyond the current context which has not yet been generated, we would have to apply additional constraints during training (i.e. make further restrictions such as i′","< i for a trigger pair (ei, ei′)).","Optimization of the model scaling factors is carried out using minimum error rate training (MERT) on the development sets. The optimization criterion is 100-BLEU since we want to maximize the BLEU score. 4.2 Tasks 4.2.1 IWSLT","For the first part of the experiments, we use the corpora that were released for the IWSLT’07 evaluation campaign. The training corpus consists of approximately 43K Chinese-English sentence pairs, mainly coming from the BTEC corpus (Basic Travel Expression Corpus). This is a multilingual speech corpus which contains tourism-related material, such as transcribed conversations about making reservations, asking for directions or conversations as taking place in restaurants. For the experiments, we use the clean data track, i.e. transcriptions of read speech. As the development set which is used for tuning the parameters of the baseline system and the reranking framework, we use the IWSLT’04 evaluation set (500 sentence pairs). The two blind test sets which are used to evaluate the final performance of the models are the official evaluation sets from IWSLT’05 (506 sentences) and IWSLT’07 (489 sentences).","The average sentence length of the training corpus is 10 words. Thus, the task is somewhat limited and very domain-specific. One of the advantages of this setting is that preliminary experiments can be carried out quickly in order to analyze the effects of the different models in detail. This and the small vocabulary size (12K entries) makes the corpus ideal for first “rapid application development”- style setups without having to care about possible constraints due to memory requirements or CPU time restrictions. 4.2.2 EPPS","Furthermore, additional experiments are based on the EPPS corpus (European Parliament Plenary Sessions) as used within the FTE (Final Text Edition) track of the TC-STAR evaluations. The corpus contains speeches held by politicians at plenary sessions of the European Parliament that have been transcribed, “corrected” to make up valid written texts and translated into several target languages. The language pairs considered in the experiments here are Spanish-English and English-Spanish.","The training corpus consists of roughly 1.3M sentence pairs with 35.5M running words on the English side. The vocabulary sizes are considerably larger than for the IWSLT task, namely around 170K on the target side. As development set, we use the development data issued for the 2006 evaluation (1122 sentences), whereas the two blind test sets are the official evaluation data from 2006 (TC-Star’06, 1117 sentences) and 2007 (TC-Star’07, 1130 sentences). 4.3 Results 4.3.1 IWSLT experiments","One of the first questions that arises is how many EM iterations should be carried out during training of the triplet model.

Figure 2 shows the rescoring performance for different numbers of EM iterations. The first 10 iterations significantly improve the triplet model performance for the IWSLT task. After that, there are no big changes. The performance even degrades a little bit after 30 iterations. For the IWSLT task, we therefore set a fixed number of 20 EM iterations for the following experiments since it shows a good performance in terms of both BLEU and TER score. The oracle TER scores of the 10k-best lists are 14.18% for IWSLT’04, 11.36% for IWSLT’05 and 18.85% for IWSLT’07, respectively.","The next chain of experiments on the IWSLT task investigates the impact of changes to the setup of training an unconstrained triplet model, such as the addition of the empty word and the inclusion of singletons (i.e. triplets that were only seen once in the","IWSLT’05 IWSLT’07","BLEU TER BLEU TER baseline 61.1 30.59 38.9 45.60 IBM model 1 61.5 30.29 39.4 45.31 trip fe+ef pall 61.7 30.24 39.7 45.24 trip fe+ef pphr 61.5 30.32 39.1 45.36 trip fe+ef palign 61.2 30.60 39.7 45.02 Table 2: Comparison of triplet variants on IWSLT CE test sets, 20 EM iterations, with singletons and empty words. training data). This might show the importance of rare events in order to derive strategies when mov-ing to larger tasks where it is not feasible to train all possible triplets, such as e.g. on the EPPS task (as shown later) or the Chinese-English NIST task. The results for the unconstrained model are shown in Table 1, beginning with a full triplet model in reverse direction, pall (e|f, f ′","), that contains no singletons and no empty words for the triggering side. In this setting, singletons seem to help on dev but there is no clear improvement on one of the test sets, whereas empty words do not make a significant difference but can be used since they do not harm either. The baseline can be improved by +0.6% BLEU and around -0.5% in TER on the IWSLT’04 set. For the various setups, there are no big differences in the TER score which might be an effect of optimization on BLEU. Therefore, for further experiments using the constraints from Section 3.2, we use both singletons and empty words as the default.","Adding the other direction p(f |e, e′",") results in another increase, with a total of +0.8% BLEU and -0.8% TER, which shows that the combination of both directions helps overall translation quality.

As can be seen, we arrive at similar improvements, namely +0.6% BLEU and -0.3% TER on IWSLT’05 and +0.8% BLEU and -0.4% TER on IWSLT’07, respectively. The constrained models, i.e. the phrase-bounded (pphr ) and path-aligned ( palign ) triplets are outperformed by the full unconstrained case, although on IWSLT’07 both unconstrained and path-aligned models are close.","For a fair comparison, we added a classical IBM model 1 in the rescoring framework.

One possibility to reduce the number of extracted triplets is to apply a maximum distance constraint in the training procedure, i.e. only trigger pairs are considered where the distance between first and second trigger is below or equal to the specified maximum.","Table 3 shows the effect of a maximum distance constraint for the Spanish-English direction. Due to the large amount of triplets (we extract roughly two billion triplets2","for the EPPS data), we drop all triplets that occur less than 3 times which results in 640 million triplets. Also, due to time restrictions3",", we only train 4 iterations and compare it to 4 iterations of the same setting with the maximum distance set to 10. The training with the maximum distance constraints ends with a total of 380 million triplets. As can be seen (Table 3), the performance is comparable while cutting down the computation time from 9.2 to 3.1 hours. The experiments were carried out on a 2.2GHz Opteron machine with 16 GB of memory. The overall gain is +0.4–0.6% BLEU and up to -0.4% in TER.

Although no clear effect could be observed for adding empty words on the triggering side, it does not harm and, thus, we get a similar functionality to IBM model 1 being “integrated” in the triplet lexicon model. The phrase-bounded training variant uses forced alignments computed on the whole training data (i.e. search constrained to producing the target sentences of the bilingual corpus) but could not outperform the path-aligned model which reuses the alignment path information obtained in regular GIZA++ training.","Additionally, we observe a positive impact from triggers lying outside the immediate context of one predecessor or successor word. 5.1 Examples Table 7 shows an excerpt of the top entries for (e, e′",") = (taxpayer , bill ) and compares it to the top entries of a lexicon based on IBM model 1. We observe a triggering effect since the Spanish word pagar (to pay) is triggered at top position by the two English words taxpayer and bill. The average distance of taxpayer and bill is 5.4 words. The models presented in this work try to capture this property and apply it in the scoring of hypotheses in order to allow for better lexical choice in specific contexts.","In Table 8, we show an example translation where rescoring with the triplet model achieves higher n-gram coverage on the reference translation than the variant based on IBM model 1 rescoring.

The motivation of this approach is to add an additional second trigger to a translation lexicon component which can come from a more global context (on a sentence level) and allow for a more fine-grained lexical choice given a specific context. Thus, the method is related to word sense disambiguation approaches.","We showed improvements by rescoring n-best lists of the IWSLT Chinese-English and EPPS Spanish-English/English-Spanish task. In total, we achieve up to +1% BLEU for some of the test sets in comparison to the decoder baseline and up to +0.3% BLEU compared to IBM model 1.","Future work will address an integration into the decoder since the performance of the current rescoring framework is limited by the quality of the n-best lists. For the inverse model, p(e|f, f ′","), an integration into the search is directly possible. Further experiments will be conducted, especially on large tasks such as the NIST Chinese-English and Arabic-English task. Training on these huge databases will only be possible with an appropriate selection of promising triplets."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This material is partly based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0023, and was partly realized as part of the Quaero Programme, funded by OSEO, French State agency for innovation.","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Peter F.
