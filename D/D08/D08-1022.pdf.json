Typically, these models extract rules using parse trees from both or either side(s) of the bitext. The former case, with trees on both sides, is often called tree-to-tree models; while the latter case, with trees on either source or target side, include both tree-to-string and string-to-tree models (see Table 1). Leveraging from structural and linguistic informa-tion from parse trees, these models are believed to be better than their phrase-based counterparts in source target examples (partial) tree-to-tree Ding and Palmer (2005) tree-to-string Liu et al.

To make things worse, modern statistical parsers are often trained on domains quite different from those used in MT. By contrast, formally syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005) do not rely on parse trees, yet usually perform better than these linguistically sophisticated counterparts.","To alleviate this problem, an obvious idea is to extract rules from k-best parses instead. However, a k-best list, with its limited scope, has too few variations and too many redundancies (Huang, 2008). This situation worsens with longer sentences as the number of possible parses grows exponentially with the sentence length and a k-best list will only capture a tiny fraction of the whole space. In addition, many subtrees are repeated across different parses, so it is 1","For example, in recent NIST Evaluations, some of these models (Galley et al., 2006; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) ranked among top 10.

When combined with our previous orthogonal work on forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008), the forest-forest approach achieves a 2.5 BLEU points improvement over the baseline, and even outperforms the hierarchical system of Hiero, one of the best-performing systems to date.","Besides tree-to-string systems, our method is also applicable to other paradigms such as the string-to-tree models (Galley et al., 2006) where the rules are in the reverse order, and easily generalizable to pairs of forests in tree-to-tree models."]},{"title":"2 Tree-based Translation","paragraphs":["We review in this section the tree-based approach to machine translation (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), and its rule extraction algorithm (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006). 2.1 Tree-to-String System Current tree-based systems perform translation in two separate steps: parsing and decoding. The input string is first parsed by a parser into a 1-best tree, which will then be converted to a target language string by applying a set of tree-to-string transforma-tion rules. For example, consider the following example translating from Chinese to English: (a) Bùshı́ yǔ Shālóng jǔxı́ng le huı̀tán","⇓ 1-best parser (b) IP NP NPB Bùshı́ CC yǔ NPB Shālóng VPB VV jǔxı́ng AS le NPB huı̀tán r1⇓ (c) NPB Bùshı́ VPB VV jǔxı́ng AS le NPB huı̀tán with NPB Shālóng r2 ⇓ r3 ⇓ (d) Bush held NPB huı̀tán with NPB Shālóng","r4 ⇓ r5 ⇓ (e) Bush held a meeting with Sharon r2 NPB(Bùshı́) → Bush r3 VPB(VV(jǔxı́ng) AS(le) x1:NPB) → held x1 r4 NPB(Shālóng) → Sharon r5 NPB(huı̀tán) → a meeting Figure 2: Example derivation of tree-to-string translation, with rules used.

The Chinese sentence (a) is first parsed into a parse tree (b), which will be converted into an English string in 5 steps. First, at the root node, we apply rule r1 shown in Figure 1, which translates the Chinese coordina-tion construction (“... and ...”) into an English prepositional phrase. Then, from step (c) we continue applying rules to untranslated Chinese subtrees, until we get the complete English translation in (e).2","2","We swap the 1-best and 2-best parses of the example sentence from our earlier paper (Mi et al., 2008), since the current 1-best parse is easier to illustrate the rule extraction algorithm. 207","IP “Bush ..

Solid hyperedges correspond to the 1-best tree in Figure 3, while dashed hyperedges denote the alternative parse interpreting yǔ as a preposition in Figure 5.","More formally, a (tree-to-string) translation rule (Galley et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2006) is a tuple ⟨lhs(r), rhs(r), φ(r)⟩, where lhs(r) is the source-side tree fragment, whose internal nodes are labeled by nonterminal symbols (like NP and VP), and whose frontier nodes are labeled by source-language words (like “yǔ”) or variables from a set X = {x1, x2, . . .}; rhs(r) is the target-side string expressed in target-language words (like “with”) and variables; and φ(r) is a mapping from X to nonterminals. Each variable xi ∈ X occurs exactly once in lhs(r) and exactly once in rhs(r). For example, for rule r1 in Figure 1, lhs(r1) = IP ( NP(x1 CC(yǔ) x2) x3), rhs(r1) = x1 x3 with x2, φ(r1) = {x1: NPB, x2: NPB, x3: VPB}. These rules are being used in the reverse direction of the string-to-tree transducers in Galley et al. (2004). 208 2.2 Tree-to-String Rule Extraction We now briefly explain the algorithm of Galley et al. (2004) that can extract these translation rules from a word-aligned bitext with source-side parses.","Consider the example in Figure 3. The basic idea is to decompose the source (Chinese) parse into a series of tree fragments, each of which will form a rule with its corresponding English translation. However, not every fragmentation can be used for rule extraction, since it may or may not respect the alignment and reordering between the two languages. So we say a fragmentation is well-formed with respect to an alignment if the root node of every tree fragment corresponds to a contiguous span on the target side; the intuition is that there is a “translational equivalence” between the subtree rooted at the node and the corresponding target span. For example, in Figure 3, each node is annotated with its corresponding English span, where the NP node maps to a non-contiguous one “Bush ⊔ with Sharon”.","More formally, we need a precise formulation to handle the cases of one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many alignment links. Given a source-target sentence pair (σ, τ ) with alignment a, the (target) span of node v is the set of target words aligned to leaf nodes yield (v) under node v: span(v) ≜ {τi ∈ τ | ∃σj ∈ yield (v), (σj, τi) ∈ a}. For example, in Figure 3, every node in the parse tree is annotated with its corresponding span below the node, where most nodes have contiguous spans except for the NP node which maps to a gapped phrase “Bush ⊔ with Sharon”. But contiguity alone is not enough to ensure well-formedness, since there might be words within the span aligned to source words uncovered by the node. So we also define a span s to be faithful to node v if every word in it is only aligned to nodes dominated by v, i.e.: ∀τi ∈ s, (σj, τi) ∈ a ⇒ σj ∈ yield (v). For example, sibling nodes VV and AS in the tree have non-faithful spans (crossed out in the Figure), because they both map to “held”, thus neither of them can be translated to “held” alone. In this case, a larger tree fragment rooted at VPB has to be extracted. Nodes with non-empty, contiguous, and faithful spans form the admissible set (shaded nodes IP0,6 NPB0,1 Bùshı́ VP1,6 PP1,3 P1,2 yǔ NPB2,3 Shālóng VPB3,6 jǔxı́ng le huı̀tán Figure 5: An alternative parse of the Chinese sentence, with yǔ as a preposition instead of a conjunction; common parts shared with 1-best parse in Fig. 3 are elided. in the figure), which serve as potential cut-points for rule extraction.3","With the admissible set computed, rule extraction is as simple as a depth-first traversal from the root: we “cut” the tree at all admissible nodes to form tree fragments and extract a rule for each fragment, with variables matching the admissible descendant nodes. For example, the tree in Figure 3 is cut into 6 pieces, each of which corresponds to a rule on the right.","These extracted rules are called minimal rules, which can be glued together to form composed rules with larger tree fragments (e.g. r1 in Fig. 1) (Galley et al., 2006). Our experiments use composed rules."]},{"title":"3 Forest-based Rule Extraction","paragraphs":["We now extend tree-based extraction algorithm from the previous section to work with a packed forest representing exponentially many parse trees. 3.1 Packed Forest Informally, a packed parse forest, or forest in short, is a compact representation of all the derivations (i.e., parse trees) for a given sentence under a context-free grammar (Earley, 1970; Billot and Lang, 1989). For example, consider again the Chinese sentence in Example (1) above, which has (at least) two readings depending on the part-of-speech of the word yǔ: it can be either a conjunction (CC “and”) as shown in Figure 3, or a preposition (P “with”) as shown in Figure 5, with only PP and VPB swapped from the English word order.","3","Admissible set (Wang et al., 2007) is also known as “frontier set” (Galley et al., 2004). For simplicity of presentation, we assume every target word is aligned to at least one source word; see Galley et al. (2006) for handling unaligned target words. 209","These two parse trees can be represented as a single forest by sharing common subtrees such as NPB0, 1 and VPB3, 6, as shown in Figure 4. Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph (Huang and Chiang, 2005), where items like NP0, 3 are called nodes, whose indices denote the source span, and combinations like e1 : IP0, 6 → NPB0, 3 VP3, 6 we call hyperedges. We denote head (e) and tails(e) to be the consequent and antecedant items of hyperedge e, respectively. For example, head (e1) = IP0, 6, tails(e1) = {NPB0, 3, VP3, 6}. We also denote BS (v) to be the set of incoming hyperedges of node v, being different ways of deriving it. For example, in Figure 4, BS (IP0, 6) = {e1, e2}. 3.2 Forest-based Rule Extraction Algorithm Like in tree-based extraction, we extract rules from a packed forest F in two steps: (1) admissible set computation (where to cut), and (2) fragmentation (how to cut). It turns out that the exact formulation developed for admissible set in the tree-based case can be applied to a forest without any change. The fragmentation step, however, becomes much more involved since we now face a choice of multiple parse hyperedges at each node. In other words, it becomes non-deterministic how to “cut” a forest into tree fragments, which is analogous to the non-deterministic pattern-match in forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008). For example there are two parse hyperedges e1 and e2 at the root node in Figure 4. When we follow one of them to grow a fragment, there again will be multiple choices at each of its tail nodes. Like in tree-based case, a fragment is said to be complete if all its leaf nodes are admissible. Otherwise, an incomplete fragment can grow at any non-admissible frontier node v, where following each parse hyperedge at v will split off a new fragment. For example, following e2 at the root node will immediately lead us to two admissible nodes, NPB0, 1 and VP1, 6 (we will highlight admissible nodes by gray shades Algorithm 1 Forest-based Rule Extraction.","Input: forest F , target sentence τ , and alignment a","Output: minimal rule set R 1: admset ← ADMISSIBLE(F, τ, a) ▷ admissible set 2: for each v ∈ admset do 3: open ← ∅ ▷ queue of active fragments 4: for each e ∈ BS (v) do ▷ incoming hyperedges 5: front ← tails(e) \\ admset ▷ initial frontier 6: open.append(⟨{e}, front⟩) 7: while open ̸= ∅ do 8: ⟨frag, front⟩ ← open.pop() ▷ active fragment 9: if front = ∅ then 10: generate a rule r using fragment frag 11: R.append(r) 12: else ▷ incomplete: further expand 13: u ← front.pop() ▷ a frontier node 14: for each e ∈ BS (u) do 15: front′","← front ∪ (tails(e) \\ admset) 16: open.append(⟨frag ∪ {e}, front′","⟩) in this section like in Figures 3 and 4). So this fragment, frag1 = {e2}, is now complete and we can extract a rule, IP (x1:NPB x2:VP) → x1 x2. However, following the other hyperedge e1 IP0, 6 → NP0, 3 VPB3, 6 will leave the new fragment frag2 = {e1} incomplete with one non-admissible node NP0, 3. We then grow frag2 at this node by choosing hyperedge e3 NP0, 3 → NPB0, 1 CC1, 2 NPB2, 3 , and spin off a new fragment frag3 = {e1, e3}, which is now complete since all its four leaf nodes are admissible. We then extract a rule with four variables:","IP (NP(x1:NPB x2:CC x3:NPB) x4:VPB) → x1 x4 x2 x3.","This procedure is formalized by a breadth-first search (BFS) in Pseudocode 1. The basic idea is to visit each frontier node v, and keep a queue open of actively growing fragments rooted at v. We keep expanding incomplete fragments from open, and extract a rule if a complete fragment is found (line 10). Each fragment is associated with a frontier (variable 210 front in the Pseudocode), being the subset of non-admissible leaf nodes (recall that expansion stops at admissible nodes). So each initial fragment along hyperedge e is associated with an initial frontier (line 5), front = tails(e) \\ admset .","A fragment is complete if its frontier is empty (line 9), otherwise we pop one frontier node u to expand, spin off new fragments by following hyperedges of u, and update the frontier (lines 14-16), until all active fragments are complete and open queue is empty (line 7).","A single parse tree can also be viewed as a trivial forest, where each node has only one incoming hyperedge. So the Galley et al. (2004) algorithm for tree-based rule extraction (Sec. 2.2) can be considered a special case of our algorithm, where the queue open always contains one single active fragment. 3.3 Fractional Counts and Rule Probabilities In tree-based extraction, for each sentence pair, each rule extracted naturally has a count of one, which will be used in maximum-likelihood estimation of rule probabilities. However, a forest is an implicit collection of many more trees, each of which, when enumerated, has its own probability accumulated from of the parse hyperedges involved. In other words, a forest can be viewed as a virtual weighted k-best list with a huge k. So a rule extracted from a non 1-best parse, i.e., using non 1-best hyperedges, should be penalized accordingly and should have a fractional count instead of a unit one, similar to the E-step in EM algorithms.","Inspired by the parsing literature on pruning (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008) we pe-nalize a rule r by the posterior probability of its tree fragment frag = lhs(r). This posterior probability, notated αβ(frag), can be computed in an Inside-Outside fashion as the product of three parts: the outside probability of its root node, the probabilities of parse hyperedges involved in the fragment, and the inside probabilities of its leaf nodes, αβ(frag) =α(root (frag)) · ∏ e ∈ frag P(e) · ∏ v ∈ yield (frag) β(v) (2) where α(·) and β(·) denote the outside and inside probabilities of tree nodes, respectively. For example in Figure 4, αβ({e2, e3}) = α(IP0, 6) · P(e2) · P(e3) · β(NPB0, 1)β(CC1, 2)β(NPB2, 3)β(VPB3, 6). Now the fractional count of rule r is simply c(r) = αβ(lhs(r)) αβ(TOP) (3) where TOP denotes the root node of the forest.","Like in the M-step in EM algorithm, we now extend the maximum likelihood estimation to fractional counts for three conditional probabilities regarding a rule, which will be used in the experiments: P(r | lhs(r)) = c(r)","∑ r′ :lhs(r′",")=lhs(r) c(r′",") , (4) P(r | rhs(r)) = c(r)","∑ r′ :rhs(r′",")=rhs(r) c(r′",") , (5) P(r |root (lhs(r))) = c(r) ∑","r′",":root(lhs(r′","))=root(lhs(r)) c(r′",") . (6)"]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["The concept of packed forest has been previously used in translation rule extraction, for example in rule composition (Galley et al., 2006) and tree binarization (Wang et al., 2007). However, both of these efforts only use 1-best parses, with the second one packing different binarizations of the same tree in a forest. Nevertheless we suspect that their extraction algorithm is in principle similar to ours, although they do not provide details of forest-based fragmentation (Algorithm 1) which we think is non-trivial.","The forest concept is also used in machine translation decoding, for example to characterize the search space of decoding with integrated language models (Huang and Chiang, 2007). The first direct application of parse forest in translation is our previous work (Mi et al., 2008) which translates a packed forest from a parser; it is also the base system in our experiments (see below). This work, on the other hand, is in the orthogonal direction, where we utilize forests in rule extraction instead of decoding. 211 Our experiments will use both default 1-best decoding and forest-based decoding. As we will see in the next section, the best result comes when we combine the merits of both, i.e., using forests in both rule extraction and decoding.","There is also a parallel work on extracting rules from k-best parses and k-best alignments (Venugopal et al., 2008), but both their experiments and our own below confirm that extraction on k-best parses is neither efficient nor effective."]},{"title":"5 Experiments 5.1 System","paragraphs":["Our experiments are on Chinese-to-English translation based on a tree-to-string system similar to (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).

The last column shows the ratio of new rules introduced by non 1-best parses being used in 1-best derivations. common subtrees. Forest extraction, by contrast, is much faster thanks to packing and produces consistently better BLEU scores. With pruning threshold pe = 8, forest-based extraction achieves a (case in-sensitive) BLEU score of 0.2533, which is an absolute improvement of 1.0% points over the 1-best baseline, and is statistically significant using the sign-test of Collins et al. (2005) (p < 0.01). This is also 0.5 points better than (and twice as fast as) extracting on 30-best parses. These BLEU score results are summarized in Table 2, which also shows that decoding with forest-extracted rules is less than twice as slow as with 1-best rules, and only fractionally slower than with 30-best rules.","We also investigate the question of how often rules extracted from non 1-best parses are used by the decoder. Table 3 shows the numbers of rules extracted from 1-best, 30-best and forest-based extractions, and the numbers that survive after filtering on the dev set. Basically in the forest-based case we can use about twice as many rules as in the 1-best case, or about 1.5 times of 30-best extraction. But the real question is, are these extra rules really useful in generating the final (1-best) translation? The last row shows that 16.3% of the rules used in 1-best derivations are indeed only extracted from non 1-best parses in the forests. Note that this is a stronger condition than changing the distribution of rules by considering more parses; here we introduce new rules never seen on any 1-best parses. 5.3 Final Results on Large Data We also conduct experiments on a larger training dataset, FBIS, which contains 239K sentence pairs with about 6.9M/8.9M words in Chinese/English, respectively.
