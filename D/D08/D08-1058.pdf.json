In this study, the objective of sentiment analysis is to annotate a given text for polarity orientation (positive/negative). Polarity orientation identification has many useful applications, including opinion summarization (Ku et al., 2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi and Lavrenko, 2006).","To date, most of the research focuses on English and a variety of reliable English resources for sentiment analysis are available, including polarity lexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc. However, the resources for other languages are limited. In particular, few reliable resources are available for Chinese sentiment analysis1","and it is not a trivial task to manually label reliable Chinese sentiment resources.","Instead of using only the limited Chinese knowledge, this study aims to improve Chinese sentiment analysis by making full use of bilingual knowledge in an unsupervised way, including both Chinese resources and English resources. Generally speak-ing, there are two unsupervised scenarios for “borrowing” English resources for sentiment analysis in other languages: one is to generate resources in a new language by leveraging on the resources available in English via cross-lingual projections, and then perform sentiment analysis in the English language based on the generated resources, which has been investigated by Mihalcea et al. (2007); the other is to translate the texts in a new language into English texts, and then perform sentiment analysis in the English language, which has not yet been investigated.","In this study, we first translate Chinese reviews into English reviews by using machine translation services, and then identify the sentiment polarity of English reviews by directly leveraging English resources. Furthermore, ensemble methods are employed to combine the individual analysis results in each language (i.e. Chinese and English) in order to obtain improved results. Given machine translation services between the selected target language and English, the proposed approach can be applied to any other languages as well.","Experiments have been performed on a dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews. Two commercial  1 This study focuses on Simplified Chinese. 553 machine translation services (i.e. Google Translate and Yahoo Babel Fish) and a baseline dictionary-based system are used for translating Chinese reviews into English reviews. Experimental results show that the analysis of English reviews translated by the commercial translation services outperforms the analysis of original Chinese reviews. Moreover, the analysis performance can be further improved by combining the individual analysis results in different languages. The results also demonstrate that our proposed approach is more effective than the approach that leverages generated Chinese resources.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work. The proposed approach is described in detail in Section 3. Section 4 shows the experimental results. Lastly we conclude this paper in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Polarity identification can be performed on word level, sentence level or document level. Related work for word-level polarity identification includes (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kim and Hovy. 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Yao et al. 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007), and related work for sentence-level polarity identification includes (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy. 2004) Word-level or sentence-level sentiment analysis is not the focus of this paper.","Generally speaking, document-level polarity identification methods can be categorized into unsupervised and supervised.","Unsupervised methods involve deriving a sentiment metric for text without training corpus. Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. Kim and Hovy (2004) build three models to assign a sentiment category to a given sentence by combining the individual sentiments of sentiment-bearing words. Hiroshi et al. (2004) use the technique of deep language analysis for machine translation to extract sentiment units in text documents. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) determine the sentiment of a customer review by counting positive and negative terms and taking into account contextual valence shifters, such as negations and intensifiers. Devitt and Ahmad (2007) explore a computable metric of positive or negative polarity in financial news text.","Supervised methods consider the sentiment analysis task as a classification task and use labeled corpus to train the classifier. Since the work of Pang et al. (2002), various classification models and linguistic features have been proposed to improve the classification performance (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005a; Read, 2005). Most recently, McDonald et al. (2007) investigate a structured model for jointly classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels of granularity. Blitzer et al. (2007) investigate domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on online reviews for different types of products. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008) present a new system consisting of the ensemble of a corpus-based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier with precision-based vote weighting.","Research work focusing on Chinese sentiment analysis includes (Tsou et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2006; Li and Sun, 2007; Wang et al., 2007). Such work represents heuristic extensions of the unsupervised or supervised methods for English sentiment analysis.","To date, the most closely related work is Mihalcea et al. (2007), which explores cross-lingual projections to generate subjectivity analysis resources in Romanian by leveraging on the tools and resources available in English. They have investigated two approaches: a lexicon-based approach based on Romanian subjectivity lexicon translated from English lexicon, and a corpus-based approach based on Romanian subjectivity-annotated corpora obtained via cross-lingual projections. In this study, we focus on unsupervised sentiment polarity identification and we only investigate the lexicon-based approach in the experiments.","Other related work includes subjective/objective analysis (Hatzivassiloglon and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and opinion mining and summarization (Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni. 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Ku et al., 2006; Titov and McDonald, 2008)."]},{"title":"3 The Proposed Approach 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["The motivation of our approach is to make full use of bilingual knowledge to improve sentiment analysis in a target language, where the resources 554 for sentiment analysis are limited or unreliable.

A Chinese review is translated into the corresponding English review using machine translation services, and then the Chinese review and the English review are analyzed based on Chinese resources and English resources, respectively. The analysis results are then combined to obtain more accurate results under the assumption that the individual sentiment analysis can complement each other. Note that in the framework, different machine translation services can be used to obtain different English reviews, and the analysis of English reviews translated by a specific machine translation service is conducted separately. For simplicity, we consider the English reviews translated by different machine translation services as reviews in different languages, despite the fact that in essence, they are still in English.

Manual translation is time-consuming and laborintensive, and it is not feasible to manually translate a large amount of Chinese product reviews in real applications. Fortunately, machine translation techniques have been well developed in the NLP field, though the translation performance is far from satisfactory. A few commercial machine translation services can be publicly accessed. In this study, the following two commercial machine translation services and one baseline system are used to translate Chinese reviews into English reviews.","Google Translate 2","(GoogleTrans): Google Translate is one of the state-of-the-art commercial machine translation systems used today. Google Translate applies statistical learning techniques to build a translation model based on both monolin-gual text in the target language and aligned text consisting of examples of human translations between the languages.","Yahoo Babel Fish 3","(YahooTrans): Different from Google Translate, Yaho Babel Fish uses SYSTRAN’s rule-based translation engine. SYSTRAN was one of the earliest developers of machine translation software. SYSTRAN applies complex sets of specific rules defined by linguists to analyze and then transfer the grammatical structure of the source language into the target language.","Baseline Translate (DictTrans): We simply develop a translation method based only on one-to-one term translation in a large Chinese-to-English  2 http://translate.google.com/translate_t 3 http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt Chinese review Chinese Resource English review Machine translation Chinese sentiment analysis Ensemble English sentiment analysis English Resource Polarity Value Polarity Value Pos\\Neg 555 dictionary.

In this study, we use the LDC_CE_DIC2.04","constructed by LDC as the dictionary for translation, which contains 128366 Chinese terms and their corresponding English terms.","The Chinese-to-English translation performances of the two commercial systems are deemed much better than the weak baseline system. Google Translate has achieved very good results on the Chinese-to-English translation tracks of NIST open machine translation test (MT)5","and it ranks the first on most tracks. In the Chinese-to-English task of MT2005, the BLEU-4 score of Google Translate is 0.3531, and the BLEU-4 score of SYSTRAN is 0.1471. We can deduce that Google Translate is better than Yahoo Babel Fish, without considering the recent improvements of the two systems.","Here are two running example of Chinese reviews and the translated English reviews (Human-Trans refers to human translation): Positive Example: 优点很多,外形也很好。 HumanTrans: Many advantages and very good shape. GoogleTrans: Many advantages, the shape is also very good. YahooTrans: Merit very many, the contour very is also good. DictTrans: merit very many figure also very good Negative example: 内存太小不支持红外。 HumanTrans: The memory is too small to support IR. GoogleTrans: Memory is too small not to support IR. YahooTrans:The memory too is small does not support infrared. DictTrans: memory highest small negative not to be in favor of ir.","3.3 Individual Semantic Orientation Value Computation For any specific language, we employ the semantic orientated approach (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006) to compute the semantic orientation value of a review. The unsupervised approach is quite straightforward and it makes use of the following sentiment lexicons: positive Lexicon (Positive_Dic) including terms expressing positive polarity, Negative Lexicon (Negative_Dic) including terms expressing negative polarity, Negation  4 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm 5 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ Lexicon (Negation_Dic) including terms that are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, and Intensifier Lexicon (Intensifier_Dic) including terms that are used to change the degree to which a term is positive or negative.

The clues in this file were collected from a number of sources. Some were culled from manually developed resources, e.g. general inquirer9","(Stone et al., 1966). Others were identified automatically using both annotated and unannotated data.

The reviews were posted by users and they focused on such products as mp3 players, mobile phones, digital camera and laptop computers. Users usually selected for each review an icon indicating “pos-tive” or “negative”. The reviews were first categorized into positive and negative classes according to the associated icon. The polarity labels for the reviews were then checked by subjects. Finally, the dataset contained 886 product reviews with accurate polarity labels. All the 886 reviews were used as test set.","We used the standard precision, recall and F-measure to measure the performance of positive and negative class, respectively, and used the MacroF measure and accuracy metric to measure the overall performance of the system. The metrics are defined the same as in general text categorization. 4.2 Individual Analysis Results In this section, we investigate the following individual sentiment analysis results in each specified language:","CN: This method uses only Chinese lexicons to analyze Chinese reviews;  10 http://www.it168.com","GoogleEN: This method uses only English lexicons to analyze English reviews translated by GoogleTrans;","YahooEN: This method uses only English lexicons to analyze English reviews translated by YahooTrans;","DictEN: This method uses only English lexicons to analyze English reviews translated by DictTrans;","In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al. (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. We use a large English-to-Chinese dictionary - LDC_EC_DIC2.0 11","with 110834 entries for projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons via one-to-one translation. Based on the generated Chinese lexicons, two other individual methods are investigated in the experiments:","CN2: This method uses only the generated Chinese Resources to analyze Chinese reviews.","CN3: This method combines the original Chinese lexicons and the generated Chinese lexicons and uses the extended lexicons to analyze Chinese reviews.","Table 1 provides the performance values of all the above individual methods. Seen from the table, the performances of GoogleEN and YahooEN are much better than the baseline CN method, and even the DictEN performs as well as CN. The results demonstrate that the use of English resources for sentiment analysis of translated English reviews is an effective way for Chinese sentiment analysis. We can also see that the English sentiment analysis performance relies positively on the translation performance, and GoogleEN performs the best while DictEN performs the worst, which is consistent with the fact the GoogleTrans is deemed the best of the three machine translation systems, while DictTrans is the weakest one.","Furthermore, the CN method outperforms the CN2 and CN3 methods, and the CN2 method performs the worst, which shows that the generated Chinese lexicons do not give any contributions to the performance of Chinese sentiment analysis. We explain the results by the fact that the term-based one-to-one translation is inaccurate and the generated Chinese lexicons are not reliable. Overall, the  11 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm 558 approach through cross-lingual lexicon translation does not work well for Chinese sentiment analysis in our experiments. 4.3 Ensemble Results In this section, we first use the simple average ensemble method to combine different individual analysis results. Table 2 provides the performance values of the average ensemble results based on different individual methods.","Seen from Tables 1 and 2, almost all of the average ensembles outperforms the baseline CN method and the corresponding individual methods, which shows that each individual methods have their own evidences for sentiment analysis, and thus fusing the evidences together can improve performance. For the methods of CN+GoogleEN, CN+YahooEN and CN+DictEN, we can see the ensemble performance is not positively relying on the translation performance: CN+YahooEN performs better than CN+GoogleEN, and even CN+DictEN performs as well as CN+GoogleEN. The results show that the individual methods in the ensembles can complement each other, and even the combination of two weak individual methods can achieve good performance. However, the DictEN method is not effective when the ensemble methods have already included GoogleEN and YahooEN. Overall, the performances of the ensemble methods rely on the performances of the most effective constituent individual methods: the methods including both GoogleEN and YahooEN perform much better than other methods, and CN+GoogleEN+YahooEN performs the best out of all the methods.","We further show the results of four typical average ensembles by varying the combination weights. The combination weights are respectively specified as λĊN+(1-λ)ĠoogleEN, λĊN+(1- λ)ẎahooEN, λĊN+(1-λ)ḊictEN, λ1ĊN+λ2ĠoogleEN+(1-λ1-λ2)ẎahooEN. The results over the MacroF metric are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. We can see from the figures that GoogleEN and YahooEN are dominant factors in the ensemble methods.","We then investigate to use other ensemble methods introduced in Section 3.4 to combine the CN, GoogleEN and YahooEN methods. Table 3 gives the comparison results. The methods of “Weighted Average1” and “Weighted Average2” are two weighted average ensembles using the two weigh-ing schemes, respectively. We can see that all the ensemble methods outperform the constituent individual method, while the two weighted average ensembles perform the best. The results further demonstrate the good effectiveness of the ensemble combination of individual analysis results for Chinese sentiment analysis.
