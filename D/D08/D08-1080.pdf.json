Users can specify their request for information as a query/topic – a set of one or more sentences or questions. Producing a good summary of the relevant information relies on understand-ing the query and linking it with the associated set of documents. To “understand” the query we expand it using encyclopedic knowledge in Wikipedia. The expanded query is linked with its associated documents through spreading activation in a graph that represents words and their grammatical connections in these documents. The topic expanded words and activated nodes in the graph are used to produce an extractive summary. The method proposed is tested on the DUC summarization data. The system implemented ranks high compared to the participating systems in the DUC competitions, confirming our hypothesis that encyclopedic knowledge is a useful addi-tion to a summarization system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Topic-driven summarization reflects a user-based summarization task: from a set of documents derive a summary that contains information on a specific topic of interest to a user. Producing a good summary relies on “understanding” the user’s information request, and the documents to be summarized. It is commonly agreed that the verbal part of a text provides pointers to a much larger body of knowledge we assume the listener has. An American citizen, for example, when told There will be fireworks on July 4th",", understands that there will be a celebration involving fireworks on the occasion of the U.S. Independence Day. Understanding an utterance implies lexical, common-sense and encyclopedic knowledge. Lexical knowledge is usually incorporated in systems through machine readable dictionaries, wordnets or thesauri. Common-sense and encyclopedic knowledge were harder to capture, but recently Wikipedia has opened the possibility of accessing such knowledge on a large scale, and in numerous languages.","To “understand” a user’s information request – one or more sentences or questions (the topic of the summary) – summarization systems try to expand it. This will provide later stages of processing with more keywords/keyphrases for retrieving from the documents relevant fragments. In this paper we experiment with Wikipedia for topic expansion. The body of research involving Wikipedia as a source of knowledge is growing fast, as the NLP community finds more and more applications of this useful resource: it is used to acquire knowledge (Suchanek et al., 2007; Auer et al., 2007); to induce taxonomies and compute semantic relatedness (Ponzetto & Strube, 2007b; 2007a); as a source of features for text classification (Gabrilovich & Markovitch, 2006) and for answering questions (Ahn et al., 2004; Katz et al., 2005). The work presented here uses hyperlinks in Wikipedia articles to expand keywords and keyphrases extracted from the query. Ambiguous words are disambiguated using the context provided by the query.","“Understanding” the documents to be summarized implies identifying the entities mentioned, how 763 they are connected, and how they are related to the entities in the topic. For this, we start again from the topic, and spread an activation signal in a large graph that covers all documents for this topic – nodes are words/named entities in the texts, links are grammatical relations. This way we cross from the topic to the documents, and combine information which is important in the topic with information which is important and relevant in the documents. We take the most highly activated nodes as additional topic expansions, and produce an extractive summary by choosing from the sentences that connect the topic expansion words in the large document graph.","The experiments confirm that Wikipedia is a source of useful knowledge for summarization, and that further expanding the topic within the associated set of documents improves the summarization results even more. We compare the performance of the summarization system to that of participating systems in the DUC competitions. The system we describe ranks 2nd",", 9th","and 5th","in terms of ROUGE-SU4 on the DUC 2005, DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 data respectively."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["While the recent exponential increase in the amount of information with which we must cope makes summarization a very desirable tool in the present, summarization is not a novel task. Rath et al. (1961) and Edmundson (1969) have explored extractive summary formation, and have raised important evaluation issues for extractive summaries when compared to several human produced gold standards. Nowadays, summarization methods try to incorporate tools, methodologies and resources developed over the past decades. The NIST organized competitions under the Document Understanding Conferences – DUC (since 2008, Text Analysis Conference (TAC))1","events provide a forum for the comparison of a variety of approaches, ranging from knowledge poor – Gotti et al. (2007) rely exclusively on a parser, without any additional sources of information – to knowledge rich and complex – GISTexter (Hickl et al., 2007) combines question answering, textual entailment, topic signature modules and a va-1 http://duc.nist.gov/, http://www.nist. gov/tac. riety of knowledge sources for summarization.","The most frequently used knowledge source in NLP in general, and also for summarization, is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). Barzilay & Elhadad (1999) use WordNet to model a text’s content relative to a topic based on lexical chains. The sentences intersected by the most and strongest chains are chosen for the extractive summary. Alternative sources for query expansion and document processing have also been explored. Amini & Usunier (2007) use the documents to be summarized them-selves to cluster terms, and thus expanding the query “internally”. More advanced methods for query expansion use “topic signatures” – words and grammatically related pairs of words that model the query and even the expected answer from sets of documents marked as relevant or not (Lin & Hovy, 2000; Harabagiu, 2004).","Graph-based methods for text summarization work usually at the level of sentences (Erkan & Radev, 2004; Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004). Edge weights between sentences represent a similarity measure, and a PageRank algorithm is used to determine the sentences that are the most salient from a collection of documents and closest to a given topic. At the word level, Leskovec et al. (2004) build a document graph using subject-verb-object triples, semantic normalization and coreference resolution. They use several methods (node degree, PageRank, Hubs, etc.) to compute statistics for the nodes in the network, and use these as attribute values in a machine learning algorithm, where the attribute that is learned is whether the node should appear in the final summary or not. Annotations for train-ing come from human produced summaries. Mohamed & Rajasekaran (2006) incrementally build a graph for a document collection by combining graph-representations of sentences. Links between entities in a sentence can be isa (within an NP) or related to (between different phrases in a sentence). Nodes and relations are weighted according to their connectivity, and sentence selection for the final summary is based on the most highly connected nodes. Ye & Chua (2006) build an extractive summary based on a concept lattice, which captures in a hierarchical structure co-occurrences of concepts among sentences. Nodes higher in this structure correspond to frequently co-occurring terms, and are 764 <topic> <num> D0704A < /num> <title> Amnesty International < /title> <narr> What is the scope of operations of Amnesty International and what are the international reactions to its activities?

Edges between nodes cover several types of relations: adjacency (ADJ); identity – instance of the same word (SAME); other semantic links, in particular synonymy and hypernymy; PHRASE links connect components of a phrase; NAME indicate named entities; COREF link coreferential name in-stances. Among other things, they identify regions of the text salient to a user’s query, based on spreading activation starting from query words in this document graph. Spreading activation was introduced in the 60s and 70s to model psychological processes of memory activation in humans (Quillian, 1967; Collins & Loftus, 1975).","In this approach we use Wikipedia as a source of knowledge for related concepts – the texts of hyperlinks in an article describing a concept are taken as its related concepts. The query is further expanded by using spreading activation to move away from the topic in a large graph that covers all documents for a given topic. From the nodes thus reached we select using a PageRank algorithm the ones that are most important in the documents. We study the impact of a decay parameter which controls how far to move from the topic, and the number of highest ranked nodes to be added to the expanded topic. The summary is built based on word associations in the documents’ graph."]},{"title":"3 Topic Expansion with EncyclopedicKnowledge or WordNet","paragraphs":["In DUC topic-driven multi-document summarization, the topic has a title, an ID that links it to a set of documents, and one or more sentences and/or questions, as illustrated in Figure 1.","Topic processing is done in several steps: 1.

For example, Turkey – referring to the country – appears in several topics in the DUC 2007 data. There are multiple entries for “Turkey” in Wikipedia – for the country, the bird, cities with this name in the U.S. among others. We use a Lesk-like measure, and compute the overlap between the topic query and the set of hyperlinks in the first paragraph (Lesk, 1986). We choose the expansion for the entry with the highest overlap.

Finally, Wikipedia is rich in named entities, which are not in the scope of a semantic lexicon. WordNet does contain named entities, but not on the scale on which Wikipedia does.","For the 45 topics from DUC 2007, the expansion with Wikipedia generated 1054 additional words, while with WordNet 2510.

The overlap between the two sets of expansions is 48 words (0.046 relative to Wikipedia expansions, 0.019 relative to WordNet)."]},{"title":"4 Topic Expansion with SpreadingActivation and PageRank","paragraphs":["Concepts related to the ones in the topic provide a good handle on the documents to summarize – they indicate parts of the document that should be included in the summary. It is however obvious that the summary should contain more than that, and this information comes from the documents to be summarized. Amini & Usunier (2007) have shown that expanding the query within the set of documents leads to good results. Following this idea, to find more relevant concepts we look for words/NEs which are related to the topic, and at the same time important in the collection of documents for the given topic. The methods described in this section are applied on a large graph that covers the entire document collection for one topic. The documents are processed in a similar way to the query – parsed with the Stanford Parser, output in dependency relation format, lemmatized using XTag’s morphological data file. The graph consists of nodes corresponding to lemmatized words and NEs in the documents, and edges correspoding to grammatical dependency relations. 4.1 Spreading Activation To find words/NEs related to the topic we spread an activation signal starting from the topic words and their expansions (in a manner similar to (Mani & Bloedorn, 1999), and using an algorithm inspired by (Anderson, 1983)), which are given a node weight of 1. As we traverse the graph starting from these nodes, the signal is propagated by assigning a weight to each edge and each node traversed based on the signal strength. The signal strength diminishes with the distance from the node of origin depending on a signal decay parameter, according to the formula: wn(N0) = 1; st","= (1 − decay) ∗ wn(Nt) Out(Nt) ; wn(Nt+1) = st; we(Nt, Nt+1)t+1 = we(Nt, Nt+1)t + st; where Nt is the current node; Nt+1 is the node we are moving towards; wn(Nt) is the weight of node Nt; st is the signal strength at step t; Out(Nt) 767 Topic Topic expanded words Top ranked nodes D0738 What is the status of mining in central and South America?

The weight of the edges is cumulative, to gather strength from all signals that pass through the edge. Activation is spread sequentially from each node in the (expanded) topic.","The decay parameter is used to control how far the influence of the starting nodes should reach – the lower the decay, the farther the signal can reach. 4.2 PageRank The previous step has assigned weights to edges in the graph, such that higher weights are closer to topic and/or topic expanded words. After this initialization of the graph, we run a PageRank algorithm (Brin & Page, 1998) to determine more important nodes. By running this algorithm after initializ-ing the graph edge weights, from the nodes that are closer to topic and topic expanded words we boost those that are more important in the documents.","The starting point of the PageRank algorithm is the graph with weighted edges obtained in the previous step. The node weights are initialized with 1 (the starting value does not matter). Analysis of the documents graph for several topics has revealed that there is a large highly interconnected structure, and many disconnected small (2-3 nodes) fragments. Page Rank will run on this dense core structure. The PageRank algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the graph is aperiodic and irreducible (Grimmett & Stirzaker, 1989). Aperiodicity implies that the greatest common divisor of the graph’s cycles is 1 – this condition is met. Irreducibility of the graph means that it has no leaves, and there are no two nodes with the same set of neighbours. The remedy in such cases is to connect each leaf to all other nodes in the graph, and conflate nodes with the same set of neighbours.","Once the graph topology meets the PageRank convergence conditions, we run the algorithm. The original formula for computing the rank of a node at each iteration step is:","P R(ni) = 1 − d N + d ∑","nj∈Adjn i P R(nj) Out(nj) where ni is a node, d is the damping factor (usually d = 0.85 and this is the value we use as well), N is the number of nodes in the graph, P R(ni) is the rank of node ni, Adjni is the set of nodes adjacent to ni, and Out(nj) is the number of outgoing edges from nj (our graph is non-directed, so this number is the total number of edges with one end in nj).

Wikipedia articles are a source of relevant related concepts, that are useful for expanding a summarization query. Furthermore, including information from the documents to be summarized by choosing relevant concepts – based on closeness to topic keywords and relative importance – improves even more the quality of the summaries, judged through ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4 and BE recall scores, as it is commonly done in the DUC competitions. The topic expansion methods explored lead to high summarization performance – ranked 2nd",", 9th","and 5th","on DUC 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively according to ROUGE-SU4 scores – compared to (more than 30) DUC participating systems.","The graph representation of the documents is central to the summarization method we described. Because of this, we plan to improve this representation by collapsing together coreferential nodes and clustering together related concepts, and verify whether such changes impact the summarization results, as we expect they would.","Being able to move away from the topic within the set of documents and discover new relevant nodes is an important issue, especially from the point of view of a new summarization style – updates. In update summaries the starting point is a topic, which a summarization system must track in consecutive sets of documents. We can adjust the spreading activation parameters to how far a new set of documents is from the topic. Future work includes testing the spreading activation and page ranking method in the context of the update summarization task and exploring methods of extracting related concepts from the full text of Wikipedia articles.
