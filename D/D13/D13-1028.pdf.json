Current techniques rely primarily on surface level features such as string match, syntactic features such as apposition, and shallow semantic features such as number, gender, semantic class, etc.","Despite similarities between Chinese and English, there are differences that have a significant impact on coreference resolution. In this paper, we focus on exploiting one of the key characteristics of Chinese text, zero pronouns (ZPs), to improve Chinese coreference resolution. In particular, a simplified semantic role labeling (SRL) framework is proposed to identify Chinese clauses and to detect zero pronouns effectively, and two effective methods are employed to exploit zero pronouns for Chinese coreference resolution. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in improving the performance of Chinese coreference resolution. Our work is novel in that it is the first work that incorporates the use of zero pronouns to significantly improve Chinese coreference resolution","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our baseline Chinese coreference resolution system. Section 3 motivates how the detection of zero pronouns can improve Chinese coreference resolution, using an illustrating example. Section 4 presents our approach to detect zero pronouns. Section 5 proposes two methods to exploit zero pronouns to improve Chinese coreference resolution, based on a corpus study and preliminary experiments. Section 6 briefly outlines the related work. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Chinese Coreference Resolution","paragraphs":["According to Webber (1978), coreference resolution can be decomposed into two complementary subtasks: (1) anaphoricity determination: decid-ing whether a given noun phrase (NP) is anaphoric or not; and (2) anaphora resolution: linking to-gether multiple mentions of a given entity in the world. Our Chinese coreference resolution system also contains these two components. Using the training data set of CoNLL-2012 shared task, we first train an anaphoricity classifier to determine whether 278 a mention is anaphoric or not, and then employ an independently-trained coreference resolution system to resolve those mentions which are classified as anaphoric. The lack of gender and number makes both anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution in Chinese more difficult. 2.1 Anaphoricity Determination Since only the mentions that take part in coreference chains are annotated in the CoNLL-2012 shared task data set, we first generate a high-recall, low-precision mention extraction module to extract as many mentions as possible. The mention extraction module relies mainly on syntactic parse trees. We extract all NP nodes, QP (quantifier phrase, i.e., complex amount/measure phrase) nodes, and all terminals with part-of-speech tags PN (pronoun) and NR (proper noun) in parse trees to form a mention candidate set. Then, we employ some rules to remove unlikely mentions, e.g., those which contain (1) measure words such as ‘一年/one year’ and ‘一顿/one time’; (2) named entities whose categories are PERCENT, MONEY, QUANTITY, and CARDINAL; (3) interrogative pronouns such as ‘ 什么/what’ and ‘哪儿/where’.","After pruning, we employ a learning-based method to train an independent classifier to determine whether the remaining mentions are anaphoric. Table 1 lists all the features employed in our anaphoricity determination system. 2.2 Coreference Resolution Our Chinese coreference resolution system adopts the same learning-based model and the same set of 12 features as Soon et al. (2001). Considering the special characteristics of conversation and web texts (i.e., a large proportion of personal pronouns and the organization of a text into several parts1",") and prepar-ing for dealing with zero pronouns, we add some features shown in Table 2.2","1","A text in the CoNLL-2012 data set is broken down into different “parts”.","2","AN denotes anaphor, CA denotes antecedent candidate, IP denotes a simple clause, and CP denotes a clause headed by a complementizer. For the feature ANPronounRanking, the relative ranking of a given pronoun is based on its semantic role and surface position, and we assign the highest rank to zero pronouns, similar to Kong et al.

From the results, we find that:","• Using automatic mentions, our system achieves 56.27, 76.73, and 49.13 in F-measure on MUC, BCUBED, and CEAF evaluation metrics, respectively.","• Using gold mention boundaries improves the performance of our system by 14.57, 4.31, and 5.62 in F-measure, due to large gains in both recall and precision. We also find that using gold mention boundaries can boost the recall of mention detection. As described above, our anaphoricity determination model relies mainly on the parser. Using gold mention boundaries can improve the parser performance. Thus our coreference resolution system can benefit much from using gold mention boundaries (especially the recall).","• Employing gold mentions further boosts our system significantly. In comparison with using gold mention boundaries, the performance improvement is attributed more to an increase in precision.","In comparison with the three best systems of CoNLL-2012 in the Chinese closed track (shown in Table 5), considering average F-measure, we find that using automatic mentions, our system is only inferior to that of Chen and Ng (2012); using gold mention boundaries, our system achieves the best performance; and using gold mentions, our system is only a little worse than that of Chen and Ng (2012)."]},{"title":"3 Motivation","paragraphs":["In order to analyze the impact of zero pronouns on Chinese coreference resolution, we first use the released OntoNotes v5.0 data (i.e., the training and development portions of the CoNLL-2012 shared task) in a corpus study.","Statistics show that anaphoric zero pronouns account for 10.7% of the mentions in coreference chains in the training data, while in the development data, the proportion is 11.3%. The experimental results of our Chinese coreference resolution system (i.e., the baseline) show that using both gold mention boundaries and gold mentions significantly improves system performance, especially for recall, largely due to improved parser performance. We then analyze the impact of zero pronouns on Chinese syntactic parsing. As a preliminary exploration, we integrate Chinese zero pronouns into the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), experimenting with gold-standard or automatically determined zero pronouns kept or stripped off (using gold-standard word segmentation provided in the CoNLL-2012 data). The results indicate that given gold-standard zero pronouns, parsing performance improves by 1.8% in F-measure. Using automatically determined zero pronouns by our zero pronoun detector to be introduced in Section 4, parsing performance also improves by 1.4% in F-measure.","In order to illustrate the impact of zero pronouns on parsing performance, consider the following example:3 Example (1): 将来我们有一一一个个个重重重建建建计计计划划划。 #分公园成七个区域,#带来多一些的 景点。 ... 这这这个个个计计计划划划我们现在是等到政府的批准 我们就可以再进行,预算是#明年可以 动工了。 (In future, we have a reconstruction plan. Divide the park into seven regions, and bring some more attractions. . . . Now we wait for approval of the government before implementing this plan again. It is expected that work can start next year.)","Without considering zero pronouns, the parse tree of the second sentence output by the Berkeley parser is shown in Figure 1.","Prior to parsing, using our zero pronoun detector to be introduced in Section 4, the presence of zero pronouns (denoted by #) can be detected.

Comparing these two parse trees, we can see that the detected zero pronouns contribute to better division of clauses and improved parsing performance, which in turn leads to improved Chinese coreference resolution.","Detecting the presence of zero pronouns also helps to improve local salience modeling, leading to improved Chinese coreference resolution. Long sentences containing multiple clauses occur more frequently in Chinese compared to English. Further-more, a coreference chain can span many sentences. Zero pronouns can occur not only within one sentence (e.g., the first and second zero pronouns of Example (1)), but can also be scattered across multiple sentences (e.g., the first and third zero pronouns of Example (1)). The subjects in the second sentence of Example (1) are omitted.4","Detection of zero pronouns improves local salience modeling, and leads to the correct identification of all the noun phrases of the coreference chain in Example (1)."]},{"title":"4 Zero Pronoun Detection","paragraphs":["Empty elements are those nodes in a parse tree that do not have corresponding surface words or phrases. Although empty elements exist in many languages","4","In Chinese, pro-dropped subjects account for more than 36% of subjects in sentences (Kim, 2000). and serve different purposes, they are particularly important for some languages, such as Chinese, where subjects and objects are frequently dropped to keep a discourse concise. Among empty elements, type *pro*, namely zero pronoun, is either used for dropped subjects or objects, which can be recovered from the context (anaphoric), or it is of little interest for the reader or listener to know (non-anaphoric). In the Chinese Treebank, type *pro* constitutes about 20% (Yang and Xue, 2010), and more than 85% of them are anaphoric (Kong and Zhou, 2010). Thus, zero pronouns are very important in bridging the in-formation gap in a Chinese text. In this section, we will introduce our zero pronoun detector.","In Chinese, a zero pronoun always occurs just before a predicate phrase node (e.g., VP). In particular, if the predicate phrase node occurs in a coordinate structure or is modified by an adverbial node, we only need to consider its parent. A simplified semantic role labeling (SRL) framework (only including predicate recognition, argument pruning, and argument identification) is adopted to identify the predicate phrase subtree (Xue, 2008), i.e., the minimal subtree governed by a predicate and all its arguments.","We carry out zero pronoun detection for every predicate phrase subtree in an iterative manner from a parse tree, i.e., determining whether there is a zero pronoun before the given predicate phrase sub-282 IP                   VP                   VP       VP  VV 分 NP NN 公园 VP       VV 成","NP  QP  CD 七 CLP M 个 NP NN 区域 PU , VP           VV 带来 NP       DNP      ","QP  ADVP AD 多 QP  CD 一 CLP M 些 DEG 的 NP NN 景点 PU 。 Figure 1: The parse tree without considering zero pronouns tree. Viewing the position before the given predicate phrase subtree as a zero pronoun candidate, we can perform zero pronoun detection using a machine learning approach.","During training, if a zero pronoun candidate has a counterpart in the same position in the annotated training corpus (either anaphoric or non-anaphoric), a positive example is generated. Otherwise, a negative example is generated. During testing, each zero pronoun candidate is presented to the zero pronoun detector to determine whether it is a zero pronoun.","The features that are employed to detect zero pronouns mainly model the context of the clause itself, the left and right siblings, and the path of the clause to the root node. Table 6 lists the features in detail. 4.1 Results and Analysis We evaluate our zero pronoun detector using gold parse trees and automatic parse trees produced by the Berkeley parser.

In both anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution, the output results of the retrained parser are employed to generate all features. 5.2 Refining Learning Example Generation In order to model the salience of all entities, we regard all zero pronouns as a special kind of NPs when generating the learning examples. Considering the modest performance of our anaphoricity determination module, we do not determine the anaphoricity of zero pronouns. Instead, in the coreference resolution stage, all zero pronouns will be considered during learning example generation (including both training and test example generation).","For example, consider a coreference chain A1-A2-Z0-A3-A4 containing one zero pronoun found in an annotated training document. A1, A2, A3, and A4 are traditional entity mentions, and Z0 is a zero pronoun. During training, pairs of mentions in the chain that are immediately adjacent (i.e., A1-A2, A2-Z0, Z0-A3, and A3-A4) are used to generate the positive training examples. Among them, two examples (i.e., A2-Z0 and Z0-A3) are associated with a zero pronoun, which can act as both an anaphor and an antecedent. For each positive pair, e.g., Z0-A3, we find any noun phrase and zero pronoun occurring between the anaphor A3 and the antecedent Z0, and pair each of them with A3 to form a negative example. Similarly, test examples can be generated except that only the preceding mentions and zero pronouns in the current and previous two sentences will be paired with an anaphor.","Incorporating zero pronouns models salience of all entities more accurately. The ratio of positive to negative examples is also less skewed as a result of considering zero pronouns – the ratio changes from 1:7.9 to 1:6.8 after considering zero pronouns. 5.3 Reprocessing Although in the OntoNotes corpus, dropped subjects and objects (i.e., zero pronouns) are considered during coreference resolution for Chinese, they are not 284 Feature Description ClauseClass Whether the given clause is a terminal clause or non-terminal clause.

ParentIP/VP Whether the syntactic category of the immediate parent of the given clause is an IP or VP. RootPath Whether the path from the given clause to the root of the parse tree contains an NP or VP or CP. This feature models how the given clause is syntactically connected to the sentence as a whole, reflecting its function within the sentence. ClauseType The given clause is an independent clause, a subordinate clause, or others. Has-Arg0/Arg1 Whether the given clause has an agent or patient argument.

That is, we do not distinguish zero pronoun resolution from traditional coreference resolution, and only view zero pronouns as special pronouns. After generating all the links, zero pronouns are included in coreference chains. For every coreference chain, all zero pronouns will be removed before evaluation. 5.4 Experimental Results and Analysis For fair comparison, all our experiments in this subsection have been conducted using the same experimental settings as our baseline system. When compared to our baseline system, all improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.005).","Table 8 lists the coreference resolution performance incorporating automatically detected zero pronouns.

Using gold mentions, our average F-measure is slightly lower than that of Chen and Ng (2012).5","Table 9 presents the contribution of our two methods of exploiting zero pronouns and the impact of gold-standard zero pronouns. We conclude that:","• Both the refined parser and refined example generation improve performance. While the refined parser improves the recall of mention detection and coreference resolution, refined example generation contributes more to precision. Combining these two methods further improves coreference resolution.","• There is a performance gap of 6.01%, 4.08%, and 3.19% in F-measure on the MUC, BCUBED, and CEAF evaluation metric, respectively, between the coreference resolution system with gold-standard zero pronouns and without zero pronouns. This suggests the use-fulness of zero pronoun detection in Chinese coreference resolution.","• Our proposed methods incorporating automatic zero pronouns reduce the performance gap by about half. This shows the effectiveness of our proposed methods. 5.5 Discussion Although the evaluation of the CoNLL-2012 shared task does not consider zero pronouns, we also evaluate the performance of zero pronoun resolution on the development data set (i.e., extracting all the resolved coreference links containing zero pronouns, acting as anaphor or antecedent, to conduct the evaluation independently). The results show that, for the correct anaphoric zero pronouns, the precision","5","Statistical significance testing cannot be conducted since their output files are not released. of our system is 94.76%. So viewing zero pronouns as a special kind of NP, zero pronouns can bridge salience and contribute to coreference resolution. In Example (1), the zero pronouns occurring in the second sentence help to bridge the coreferential relation between the mention “ 这这这个个个计计计划划划/this plan” in the last sentence and the mention “ 一一一个个个重重重建建建计计计划划划/a reconstruction plan” in the first sentence."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["In the last decade, both manual rule-based approaches (Lee et al., 2011) and statistical approaches (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Fernandes et al., 2012) have been proposed for coreference resolution.
