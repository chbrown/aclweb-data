Websites like Debatepedia,1","an online, community-authored encyclopedia of debates (§2), seek to organize some of this exchange into structured information resources that summarize arguments and link externally to texts (editorials, blog posts, etc.) that express and evoke them. Empirical NLP, we propose, has a role to play in creating a more compact and easilyinterpretable way to understand the opinion space. In particular, we envision applications to computational journalism, where there is high demand for transformation of and pattern discovery in unmanageable, unstructured, evolving data (including text) to inform the public (Cohen et al., 2011).","In this paper, we develop a generative model for discovering such a representation (§3), using Debatepedia as a corpus of evidence. We draw in-spiration from Lin et al. (2008) and Ahmed and 1 http://dbp.idebate.org Xing (2010), who used generative models to infer topics—distributions over words—and other word-associated variables representing perspectives or ideologies. We view topics as lexicons, and propose that grounding a topic model with evidence beyond bags of words can lead to more lexicon-like representations. Specifically, our generative topic model grounds topics using the hierarchical organization of arguments within Debatepedia. Further, we use named entity recognition as a preprocessing step, an existing sentiment lexicon to construct an informed prior, and we incorporate a latent, discrete position variable that cuts across debates.2","We evaluate the model informally and formally (§4). Subjectively, the model identifies reasonable topic and perspective terms, and it associates topics sensibly with important public figures. In quantitative evaluations, we find the model’s representation superior to topics from vanilla latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003) and the joint sentiment topic model (Lin and He, 2009) in matching external texts to debates. Further, the position variables can be used to infer the side of an argument within a debate; our model performs with an accuracy of 86% on position prediction of the debate argument. The cross-cutting position variable is not especially consistent with human judgments, suggesting that further knowledge sources may be required to improve interpretability across issues."]},{"title":"2 Data","paragraphs":["Debatepedia, like Wikipedia, is constructed by volunteer contributors and has a system of community","2","This variable might serve to cluster debate sides according to “abstract beliefs commonly shared by a group of people,” sometimes called ideologies (Van Dijk, 1998).

Table 1: An example of a Debatepedia debate on the topic “Gun control.” moderation. Many of the debate issues covered are controversial and salient in current public discourse. Because it is primarily expressed as text, Debatepedia is a corpus of debate topics, but it is organized hierarchically, with multiple issues in each debate topic, questions within each issue, and arguments on two sides of each question. An important feature of the corpus is the widespread quotation and linking to external articles on the web, including news stories, blog postings, wiki pages, and social media forums; here we use these external articles in evaluation (§4).","Table 1 shows excerpts from a debate page3","from Debatepedia. Each debate contains “questions,” which reflect the different aspects of a debate. In this particular debate, there are 13 questions (2 shown), ranging from economic benefits to enforceability to social impacts. For each question, there are two distinct sides, each with its own set of supporting arguments. Many of these arguments also contains links to online articles where the quotes are extracted from (not shown in Table 1). For example, in the second argument on the “No” side, there is an inline link to the article written by Congressman Drinan.4","Within a debate topic, the sides cut across different questions, aligning arguments together.

Types and tokens include unigrams, bigrams and person named entities. eral, the questions are phrased so that a consistent “pro” and “con” structure is apparent throughout each debate, aligned to a high-level question (i.e., the “Yes” sides of all the questions are consistent with the same side of the larger debate). The example of Table 1 deviates from this pattern, with the self-defense “Yes” arguing “no” to the high-level debate question—Should laws be passed to limit gun ownership further?—and the economic “Yes” arguing “yes” to the high-level question. Table 2 presents statistics of our corpus. 2.1 Preprocessing We scraped the Debatepedia website and extracted the debate, question, argument, and side structure of the debate topics. We crawled the external web articles that were linked from the Debatepedia arguments. For the web articles, we extracted the main text content (ignoring boilerplate elements such as navigation and advertisments) using Boil-1859 erpipe (Kohlschütter et al., 2010).5","We tokenized the text and filtered stopwords.6","We considered both unigrams and bigrams in our model, keeping all unigrams and removing bigram types that appeared less than 5 times in the corpus. Although our modeling approach ultimately treats texts as bags of terms (unigrams and bigrams), one important preprocessing step was taken to further improve the interpretability of the inferred representation: named entity mentions of persons. We identified these mentions of persons using Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) and treated each person mention as a single token. In our qualitative analysis of the model (§4.2), we will show how this special treatment of person mentions enables the association of well-known individuals with debate topics. Though not part of our experimental evaluation in this paper, such associations are, we believe, an interesting direction for future applications of the model."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["Our model defines a probability distribution over","terms7","that are observed in the corpus.

We perform Gibbs sampling for 2,000 iterations over the dataset, discarding the first 500 iterations for burn-in, and averaging over every 10th iteration thereafter to get estimates for our term distributions. 3.3 T and K In all experiments, we use T = 40 topics and K = 2 positions.

Calculating the similarity of these distributions, we get an estimate of how closely our model can associate text related to a debate with the specific argument that linked to it. We compare with LDA (Blei et al., 2003), which ignores sentiment, and the joint sentiment topic (JST) model (Lin and He, 2009), an unsupervised model that jointly captures sentiment and topic.12","Using Jensen-Shannon divergence, we find that our approach embeds these pairs significantly closer than LDA and JST (also trained with 40 topics), under a Wilcoxon signed rank test (p < 0.001).

More challenging, of course, is selecting the argument to which an external article should be associated.

Figure 5 shows these measurements sorted from most to least different; these might be taken as evidence for which issue areas’ arguments are more lexically distinguishable by side, perhaps indicating less common ground in discourse or (more speculatively) greater controversy. For example, our model suggests that debates relating to topics like presidential politics, foreign policy, teachers, women’s health, religion, and Israel/Palestine are more heated (within the Debatepedia community at the time the debates took place) than those about the minimum wage, Iran as a nuclear threat, or immigration. Predicting positions for arguments. We tested our model’s ability to infer the positions of arguments. In this experiment (only), we held out 3,000 arguments during parameter estimation. The held-out arguments were selected so that every debate side maintained at least one argument whose inferred side could serve as the correct answer for the held-out argument. We then inferred i for each held-out argument from debate d and side s, given the parameters, and compared it with the value of id,s inferred during parameter estimation. The model achieved 86% accuracy (Table 3 shows the confu-1862 sion matrix).

Any of these is fine; we want you to tell us the grouping you find most reasonable.

A2 provided a coarse annotation along with each American politics. 14","In a small number of cases, an annotator declined to label a side.

Recall that the two sides of each debate must be in different clusters.","Table 5 shows the variation of information measure (Meila, 2003) for each pairing among the three annotators and our model. The model agrees with A2’s coarse clustering most closely, and in fact is closer to A2’s clustering than A2 is to A3’s; it also agrees with A2’s coarse clustering better than A2’s coarse and fine clusterings agree (3.36, not shown in the table). This is promising, but we do not have confidence that the positional dimension is be-ing captured especially well in this model; for those debate-sides labeled liberal or conservative by A2, the best match of our two positions was still only in agreement only about 60% of the time, and agreement with each human annotator is within the interval of what would be expected if each debate’s sides were assigned uniformly at random to positions.15 Remarks.

Noting the vast litera-ture focusing on ideological positions expressed in text, we believe this failure suggests (i) that broad-based positions that hold across many topics may require richer textual representations (see, e.g., the “syntactic priming” of Greene and Resnik, 2009), or (ii) that an alternative representation of positions, such as the spatial models favored by political scientists (Poole and Rosenthal, 1991), may be more discoverable. Aside from those issues, a stronger theory of positions may be required. Such a theory could be encoded in a more informative prior or weaker independence assumptions across debates. Finally, exploiting explicitly ideological texts along-side the moderated arguments of Debatepedia might also help to identify textual associations with general positions (Sim et al., 2013). We leave these directions to future work. 4.2 Qualitative Analysis Of the T = 40 topics our model inferred, we subjectively judged 37 to be coherent; a glimpse of each is given in Figure 5. We manually selected six of the most interpretable topics for further evaluation.","As a generative modeling approach, our model was designed for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of the sociopolitical debate space, as evidenced by Debatepedia. It is like other topic models in this regard, but we believe that some effects of our design choices are noteworthy.

We observe the benefit of our model in identifying terms associated with positions on social issues, while JST selects more general sentiment terms. 1865","Table 7 shows bigrams most strongly associated with general position distributions φi","and selected topic-position distributions φo",".16","We see the potential benefit of multiword expressions.

Subjective text classification (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) leads to opinion mining tasks such as opinion extraction (Dave et al., 2003), positive and negative polarity classification (Pang et al., 2002), sentiment target detection (Hu and Liu, 2004; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008), and feature-opinion extraction (Wu et al., 2009). The above studies are conducted mostly on product reviews, a domain with a simpler opinion landscape and more concrete rationales for those opinions, compared to sociopolitical debates.","Generative topic models have been successfully implemented in opinion mining tasks such as feature identification (Titov and McDonald, 2008), entity-topic extraction (Newman et al., 2006), mining contentious expressions and interactions (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) and specific aspect-opinion word extraction from labeled data (Zhao et al., 2010). Most relevant to this research is work on feature-sentiment extraction (Lin and He, 2009; Mei et al., 2007). Mei et al. (2007) built on PLSI, which is problematic for generalizing beyond the training sample. The JST model of Lin and He (2009) is an LDA-based topic model in which each word token is assigned both a sentiment and a topic; they exploited a sen-16 For more topics, please refer to the supplementary notes. timent lexicon in the prior distribution. Our model is closely related, but introduces a switching variable that assigns some tokens to positions, some to topics, and some to both. Unlike Lin and He’s sentiments, our model’s positions are associated with the two sides of a debate, and we incorporate topics at the level of questions within debates.","Some studies have specifically analyzed contrastive viewpoints or stances in general discussion text.Agrawal et al. (2003) used graph mining based method to classify authors in to opposite camps for a given topic. Paul et al. (2010) developed an unsupervised method for summarizing contrastive opinions from customer reviews. Abu-Jbara et al. (2012) and Dasigi et al. (2012) developed techniques to address the problem of automatically detecting sub-groups of people holding similar stances in a discussion thread.","Several prior studies have considered debates. Cabrio and Villata (2012) developed a system based on argumentation theory which recognizes the entailment and contradiction relationships between two texts. Awadallah et al. (2011) used a debate corpus as a seed for extracting person-opinion-topic tuples from news and other web documents and in later work classified the quotations to specific topics and polarity using language models (Awadallah et al., 2012). Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) and Anand et al. (2011) were interested in ideological content in debates, relying on discourse structure and leveraging sentiment lexicons to recognize stances.","Closer to the methodology we describe, Lin et al. (2008) presented a statistical model for political discourse that incorporates both topics and ideologies; they used debates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Fortuna et al. (2009) showed that it is possible to isolate a subset of terms from media content that are informative of a news organization’s bias to-wards a particular issue. Ahmed and Xing (2010) introduced multi-level latent Dirichlet allocation, and Eisenstein et al. (2011) introduced sparse additive generative models, both conceived as extensions to well-established probabilistic modeling techniques (Blei et al., 2003); these were applied to debates and political blog datasets. Our approach builds on these models (especially the switching variables of Ahmed and Xing). We go farther in jointly modeling 1866 text across many debates evidenced by the structure of Debatepedia, thus grounding our models more solidly in familiar sociopolitical issues, and in mak-ing extensive use of existing NLP resources."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Using text from Debatepedia, we inferred topics and position term lexicons in the domain of sociopolitical debates. Our approach brings together tools from information extraction and sentiment analysis into a latent-variable topic model and exploits the hierarchical structure of the dataset. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the model’s strengths and weaknesses."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors thank several anonymous reviewers, Justin Gross, David Kaufer, and members of the ARK group at CMU for helpful feedback on this work and gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the annotators.
