EMNLP has grown to be one of the largest and most competitive conferences in computational linguistics. Organized by ACL SIGDAT (the Association for Computational Linguistics special interest group for linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to natural language processing), it features papers on all areas of interest to the SIGDAT community and aligned fields. It is being held this year as a standalone conference at the Grand Hyatt Seattle, in the heart of downtown Seattle, USA over the period October 18–21, 2013. This year we introduced short papers to EMNLP for the first time, in an attempt to encourage submission of papers reporting smaller, more focused contributions and work in progress. We also put a lot of time and energy into “closing the loop” in the author response phase, in getting reviewers to explicitly acknowledge author responses and update their reviews where appropriate. We sincerely hope that this contributed towards further improvement in the quality of reviews and the decision-making process. We received a record number of 772 valid submissions (not including co-submitted papers that were withdrawn from the conference), made up of 539 long papers and 233 short papers. These papers were reviewed across a total of 15 areas, of which Machine Translation (98 submissions), Semantics (87 submissions) and NLP-related Machine Learning (76) were the largest. The submissions were managed by 30 area chairs (two per area) and evaluated by a combined programme committee of 505 reviewers. 28% of the long paper submissions and 24% of the short paper submissions were accepted for publication at the conference. Five long papers were shortlisted for the best paper award, based on input from the reviewers and area chairs, and have been scheduled for presentation in a plenary session at the end of the conference, culminating in the presentation of the best paper award. We would like to acknowledge all the hard work of the submitting authors, without whom there would, of course, be no conference. To the authors of accepted papers, we offer congratulations; to the authors of rejected papers, we offer our sincere commiserations, and dearly hope that the hard work of the programme committee provided you with valuable feedback on your research. We are eternally indebted to our dedicated and hard-working area chairs, and to the reviewers for their attention to detail and engagement with the author response/discussion phase, which was tremendously helpful in gauging the relative merits of each paper and being able to send out the notifications on time. We are very grateful to our two invited speakers: Fernando Pereira (Research Director at Google) who will draw on his considerable experience and wisdom in presenting “Meaning in the Wild”, focusing on machine understanding; and Andrew Ng (Co-CEO and Co-founder of Coursera) who will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with the delivery of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in a talk titled “The Online Revolution: Education for Everyone”, from the perspective of a true world leader in MOOC provision and Machine Learning/NLP research. We would also like to thank the inimitable Priscilla Rasmussen who single-handedly looked after the local organisation of EMNLP 2013. We also wish to acknowledge the considerable efforts of Steven Berthard who put this volume together with peerless efficiency, Francesco Figari who took excellent iii care of the conference website, and Rich Gerber from Softconf.com, who responded to any questions regarding START — the submission management system used for EMNLP 2013 — instantaneously and uncomplainingly, and helped us manage the large number of submissions smoothly. Additionally, we would like to thank Eugene Charniak, Mark Johnson and Noah Smith for serving on the best paper award committee, and providing characteristically probing and insightful critiques of the best paper award nominees. Special thanks go to David Yarowsky, the general chair for the conference, who has provided us with much valuable advice, encouragement and assistance over the past six months. We would also like to thank the members of the SIGDAT board who advised us on various matters, and our predecessors James Henderson and Marius Pasca for nudging us in the right direction on a number of occasions. On behalf of all attendees at the conference, we would also like to acknowledge the generosity of our sponsors/supports: Amazon, Google, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Inome, IBM Research, Microsoft Research, Nuance and John Hopkins University. It has been an honour to serve as Programme Chairs of EMNLP 2013. We sincerely hope that you — in equal measure — enjoy and are intellectually-stimulated by the conference, and have a pleasant stay in beautiful Seattle.
