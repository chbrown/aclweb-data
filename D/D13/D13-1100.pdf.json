However, text use changes with time, which can affect many applications. In this paper we model periodic distributions of words over time. Focus-ing on hashtag frequency in Twitter, we first automatically identify the periodic patterns. We use this for regression in order to forecast the volume of a hashtag based on past data. We use Gaussian Processes, a state-of-the-art bayesian non-parametric model, with a novel periodic kernel. We demonstrate this in a text classification setting, assigning the tweet hashtag based on the rest of its text. This method shows significant improvements over competitive baselines."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Temporal changes in text corpora are central to our understanding of many linguistic and social phenomena. Social Media platforms and the digitalization of libraries provides a vast body of times-tamped data. This allows studying of the complex temporal patterns exhibited by text usage includ-ing highly non-stationary distributions and periodicities. However, temporal effects have been mostly ignored by previous work on text analysis or at best dealt with by making strong assumptions such as smoothly varying parameters with time (Yogatama et al., 2011) or modelled using a simple uni-modal distri bution (Wang and McCallum, 2006). This paper develops a temporal model for classifying microblog posts which explicitly incorporates multimodal periodic behaviours using Gaussian Processes (GPs).","We expect text usage to follow multiple periodicities at different scales. For example, people on Social Media might talk about different topics during and after work on weekdays, talk every Friday about the weekend ahead, or comment about their favorite weekly TV show during its air time. Given this, text frequencies will display periodic patterns. This applies to other text related quantities like cooccurrence values or topic distributions over time, as well as applications outside NLP like user behaviour (Preoti̧uc-Pietro and Cohn, 2013).","Modelling temporal patterns and periodicities can be useful to tasks like text classification. For example a tweet containing ‘music’ is normally attributed to a general hashtag about music like #np (now play-ing). However, knowing time, if it occurs during the (weekly periodic) air time of ‘American Idol’ it is more likely for it to belong to #americanidol or if its mentioned in the days building up to the Video Music Awards to be assigned to #VMA.","In NLP, temporal models have treated time in overly simplistic ways and without regard to periodicities. We propose a model that first broadly identifies several types of temporal patterns: a) periodic, b) constant in time, c) falling out of use after enjoy-ing a brief spell of popularity (e.g. internet memes, news). This is performed automatically only using training data and makes no assumptions on the existence or the length of the periods we aim to model. We demonstrate the approach by modelling frequencies of hashtag occurrences in Twitter. Hashtags are user-generated labels included in tweets by their authors in order to assign them to a conversation and can be considered as a proxy for topics.","To this end, we make use of Gaussian Processes (GP) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005), a 977 Bayesian non-parametric model for regression. Using the Bayesian evidence we automatically perform model selection to classify temporal patterns. We aim to use the most suitable model for extrapolation, i.e. predicting future values from past observations. The GP is fully defined by the covariance structure assumed between the observed points, and its hyperparameters, which can be automatically learned from data. We also introduce a new kernel suitable to model the periodic behaviour we observe in text: periods of low frequency followed by bursts at regular time intervals. We demonstrate that the GP approach is more general and gives better results than frequentist models (e.g. autoregressive models) because it incorporates uncertainty explicitly and elegantly, in addition to automatic model selection and parameter fitting.","To demonstrate the practical importance of our approach, we use our GP prediction as a prior in a Naı̈ve Bayes model for text classification showing improvements over baselines which do not account for temporal periodicities. Our approach extends to more general uses, e.g. to discriminative text regression and classification. More broadly, we aim to establish GPs as a state-of-the-art model for regression and classification in NLP. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to use GP regression for forecasting and model selection within a NLP task.","All the hashtag time series data and the implementation of the PS kernel in the popular opensource Gaussian Processes packages GPML1","and GPy2","are available on the author’s website3","."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Time varying text patterns have been of particular interest in topic modelling.

GP is a probabilistic machine learning framework incorporating kernels and Bayesian nonparametrics which is widely considered as state-of-the-art for regression. The GP defines a prior over functions which applied at each input point gives a response value. Given data, we can analytically infer the posterior distribution of these functions assum-ing Gaussian noise. The kernel of the GP defines the covariance in response values as a function of its in-puts.","We can identify two different set-ups for a regression problem. If the range of values to be predicted 978 lies within the bounds of the training set we call the prediction task as interpolation. If the range of the prediction is outside the bounds, then our problem that of extrapolation. In this respect, extrapolation is considered a more difficult task and the covariance kernel which incorporates our prior knowledge plays a major role in the prediction.","There is the case when multiple covariance kernels can describe our data. For choosing the right kernel and its hyperparameters only using the training data we employ Bayesian model selection which makes a trade-off between the fit of the training data and model complexity. We now briefly give an overview of GP regression, kernel choice and model selection. We refer the interested reader to (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005) for a detailed introduc-tion to GPs. 3.1 Gaussian Process Regression Consider a time series regression task where we only have one feature, the value xt at time t. Our training data consists of n pairs D = {(t, xt)}. The model will need to predict values xt for values of t greater than those in the dataset.","GP regression assumes a latent function f that is drawn from a GP prior f (t) ∼ GP(m, k(t, t′",")) where m is the mean and k a kernel. The prediction value is obtained by the function evaluated at the corresponding data point, xt = f (t) + ε, where ε ∼ N (0, σ2",") is white-noise. The GP is defined by the mean m, here 0, and the covariance kernel function, k(t, t′",").","The posterior at a test point t∗ is given by:","p(x∗|t∗, D) = ∫ f p(x∗|t∗, f ) · p(f |D) (1) where x∗ and t∗ are the test value and time. The posterior p(f |D) shows our belief over possible functions after observing the training set D.

Due to the matrix inversion in 2, inference takes O(n3",") time where n is the number of training points. 3.2 Kernels The covariance kernel together with its parameters fully define the GP (we assume 0 mean). The kernel induces similarities in the response between pairs of data points. Intuitively, if we want a smooth function, closer points should have high covariance compared to points that are further apart. If we want a periodic behaviour points at period length intervals should have the highest covariance. Usually, this is defined by an isotropic kernel, which means its in-variant to all rigid motions.","For interpolation, a standard kernel (e.g. squared exponential) that encourages smooth functions is normally used. Figure 1 shows regression over 3 days for #goodmorning when only a random third of the values of the function are observed. We see that both the SE kernel and a periodic kernel (PS, see below) give good results.","However, for extrapolation, the choice of the kernel is paramount. The kernel encodes our prior belief about the type of function wish to learn. To illustrate this, in Figure 3, we show the time series for #good-morning over 2 weeks and plot the regression for the 979 future week learned by using different kernels.","In this study we will use multiple kernels, each most suitable for a specific category of temporal patterns in our data. This includes a new kernel inspired by observed word occurrence patterns. The kernels we use are:","Constant (C): The constant kernel is kC (t, t′",") = c. Its mean prediction will always be the value c and its assumption is that the signal is modeled only by Gaussian noise centred around this value. This describes the data best when we have a noisy signal around a stationary mean value.","Squared exponential (SE): The SE kernel or the Radial Basis Function (RBF) is the standard kernel used in most interpolation settings.","kSE(t, t′",") = s2 · exp − (t − t′",")2","2l2 (3) This gives a smooth transition between neighbour-ing points and best describes time series with a smooth shape e.g. a uni-modal burst with a steady decrease. However, its uncertainty grows with for predictions well into the future. Its two parameters s and l are the characteristic lengthscales along the two axes. Intuitively, they control the distance of in-puts on a particular axis from which the function values become uncorrelated. Using the SE kernel corresponds to Bayesian linear regression with an infinite number of basis functions (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005).","Linear (Lin): The linear kernel describes a linear relationship between outputs.","kLin(t, t′",") = s2","+ ∥t · t′","∥ (4) This can be obtained from linear regression by hav-ing N (0, 1) priors on the corresponding regression weights and a prior of N (0, s2",") on the bias.","Periodic (PER): The periodic kernel represents a SE kernel in polar coordinates.","kP ER(t, t′",") = s2","· exp −2 · (","sin2","(2π(t − t′",")2","/p)","l2 ) (5) It has a sinusoidal shape and is good at modelling periodically patterns that oscillate between low and high frequency. s and l are characteristic lengthscales as in the SE kernel and p is the period. 25 50 75 100 125 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1   s=1 s=5 s=50 Figure 2: Behaviour of the PS kernel (p=50) with varying s. Values normalized in [0,1] interval.","Periodic spikes (PS): For textual time series, like word frequencies, we identify the following periodic behaviour: abrupt rise in usage, usually with a peak, followed by periods of low occurrence, which can be short (e.g. during the night) or long lived (e.g. the entire week except for a few hours). For modelling we introduce the following kernel:","kP S(t, t′",") = cos (","sin (","2π · (t − t′",")2","p )) · exp","(","s cos(2π · (t − t′",")2",") p − s) (6) The kernel is parameterised by its period p and a shape parameter s. The period indicates the time interval between the peaks of the function, while the shape parameter controls the width of the spike. The behaviour of the kernel is illustrated in Figure 2. We constrain s ≥ 1.","In Figure 3 we see that the forecast is highly dependent on the kernel choice. We expect that for periodic data the PER and PS kernels will forecast best, maybe with the PS kernel doing a better job because it captures multiple modes of the daily in-crease in volume. We use for both kernels a period of 168 hours. This is because although a daily pattern exists, the weekly is stronger, with the day of the week influencing the volume of the hashtag. The NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error) in Table 1 on the held out data confirms this finding, with PS showing the lowest error. 980 03/1 10/1 17/1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 #goodmorning   Gold Const Linear SE Per(168) PS(168) Figure 3: Extrapolation for #goodmorning over 3 weeks with GPs using different kernels.

NRMSE computed on the third unobserved week. Lower values are better in both cases. 3.3 Model selection and optimisation We now briefly discuss the concepts of model selection in the GP framework, by which we refer to choosing the model (kernel) from a set Hi and optimising the model hyperparameters θ. In our GP Bayesian inference scheme, we can compute the probability of the data given the model which in-volves the integral over the parameter space. This is called the marginal likelihood or evidence and is useful for model selection using only the training set:","p(x|D, θ, Hi) = ∫ f p(x|D, f, Hi)p(f |θ, Hi) (7)","Our first goal is to fit the kernel by minimizing the negative log marginal likelihood (NLML) with respect to the kernel parameters θ. This approxima-tion is also known as type II maximum likelihood (ML-II). Conditioned on kernel parameters, the evidence of a GP can be computed analytically.","Our second goal is to use the evidence for model selection because it balances the data fit and the model complexity by automatically incorporating Occam’s Razor (Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2000). Because the evidence must normalise, complex models which can account for many datasets achieve low evidence. One can think of the evidence as the probability that a random draw of the parameter values from the model class would generate the dataset D. This way, complex models are penalised because they can describe many datasets, while the simple models can describe only a few datasets, thus the chance of a good data fit being very low. This is for example the case of the periodic bursts in Figure 3. Although the periodic kernel can fit the data, it will incur a high model complexity penalty. The PS kernel in this respect is a simpler model and can fit the data and is thus chosen as the right model.","When the dataset is observed, the evidence can select between the models. More generally, the model choice actually gives us an implicit classification of the temporal patterns into classes: a steady signal with noise (C kernel), a signal with local temporal patterns (SE kernel), an oscilating periodic pattern (PER kernel) or a pattern with abrupt periodic peaks (PS kernel).","We use the NLML for optimising the hyperparameters only using training data. For optimising the hyperparameters of the kernel defined in Equation 6, it is important to first identify the right period. We consider as possible periods all integer values less than half the size of the training set, and then tune the shape parameter using gradient descent to minimise NLML. We then take the argmin value of those considered. We show the NLML for a sample regression in Figure 4.","The likelihood shows that there are multiple canyons in the likelihood, which can lead a convex optimisation method to local optima. These appear when p is equal or an integer multiple of the main period of the data, in this case 24. The lowest values are obtained when p = 168, allowing the model to accommodate the day of week effect.

Experiments on a subset of data showed no major benefits of combin-ing kernels, but the computational time and model complexity increased drastically due to the extra hyperparameters. Because we will model a proportion of words within a limited time frame, there are few linear trends in the data. It might seem limiting that we only learn a single period, although we could combine periodic kernels with different periods together. But, as we have seen in the #goodmorning example (with overlapping weekly and daily patterns), if there is a combination of periods the model will select a single period which is the least common multiple."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["For our experiments we used data collected from Twitter using the public Gardenhose stream (10% representative sample of the entire Twitter stream). The data collection interval was 1 January – 28 February 2011. For simplicity in the classification task, we filtered the stream to include only tweets that have exactly one hashtag. These represent approximately 7.8% of our stream.","As text processing steps, we have tokenised all the tweets and filtered them to be written in English using the Trendminer pipeline (Preoti̧uc-Pietro et al., 2012). We also remove duplicate tweets (retweets and tweets that had the same first 6 content tokens) because they likely represent duplicate content, automated messages or spam which would bias the dataset, as also stated by Tsur and Rappoport (2012). In our experiments we use the first month of data as training and the second month as testing. Note the challenging nature of this testing configuration where predictions must be made for up to 28 days into the future. We keep a total 1176 of hashtags which appear at least 500 times in both splits of the data.

Because the total number of tweets varies depending on the day and hour of day, we chose to model the proportion of tweets with the given tag in that hour.

Some users use hashtags as regular words that are integral to the tweet text, some hashtags are general and refer to the same thing or emotion (#news, #usa, #fail), others are Twitter games or memes (#2010dissapointments, #musicmonday). Other hashtags refer to events which might be short lived (#worldcup2022), long lived (#25jan) or periodic (#raw, #americanidol). We chose to model hashtags because they group similar tweets (like topics), reflect real world events (some of which are periodic) and present direct means of evaluation.

This is somewhat similar to an autoregressive (AR) model with all the coefficients except ∆ set to 0. We highlight that given the period ∆ this is a very strong model as it gives a mean estimate at each point. Comparing to this model we can see if the GP model can recover the underlying function that described the periodic variation and filter out the noise in the observations. Correctly identifying the period is very challenging as we discuss below.","GP regression: Gaussian Process regression using only the SE kernel (GP-SE), the periodic kernel (GP-PER), the PS kernel (GP-PS).

Lower is better. 5.2 Results We start by qualitatively analysing a few sample regressions that are representative of each category of time series under study. These are shown in Figure 5. For clarity, we only plotted a few kernels on each figure. The full evaluation statistics in NRMSE and the Bayesian evidence are show in Table 2.","For the hashtag #fyi there is no clear pattern. For this reason the model that uses the constant kernel performs best, being the simplest one that can describe the data, although the others give similar results in terms of NRMSE on the held-out testing set. While functions learned using this kernel never clearly outperform others on NRMSE on held-out data, this is very useful for interpretation of the time series, separating noisy time series from those that have an underlying periodic behaviour.","The #confessionhour example illustrates a behaviour best suited for modelling using the SE kernel. We notice a sudden burst in volume which decays over the next 2 days. This is actually the behaviour typical of ‘internet memes’ (this hashtag tags tweets of people posting things they would never tell anyone) as presented in Yang and Leskovec (2011). These cannot be modelled with a constant kernel or a periodic one as shown by the results on held-out data and the time series plot. The periodic kernels will fail in trying to match the large burst with others in the training data and will at-tribute to noise the lack of a similar peak, thus discovering wrong periods and making bad predictions. In this example, forecasts will be very close to 0 under the SE kernel, which is what we would desire from the model.","The periodic kernel best models hashtags that exhibit an oscillating pattern. For example, this best fits words that are used frequently during the day and less so during the night, like #fail. Here, the period is chosen to be one week (168) rather than one day (24) because of the weekly effect superimposed on the daily one. Our model recovers that there is a daily pattern with people tweeting about their or others’ failures during the day. On weekends however, and especially on Friday evenings, people have better things to do.","The PS kernel introduced in this paper models best hashtags that have a large and short lived burst in usage. We show this by two examples. First, we choose #breakfast which has a daily and weekly pattern. As we would expect, a big rise in usage occurs during the early hours of the day, with very few occurrences at other times. Our model discovers a weekly pattern as well. This is used mainly for modelling the difference between weekends and weekdays. On weekends, the breakfast tag is more evenly spread during the hours of the morning, because people do not have to wake up for work and can have breakfast at a more flexible time than during the week. In the second example, we present a hashtag that is associated to a weekly event: #raw is used to discuss a wrestling show that airs every week for 2 hours on Monday evenings in the U.S.. With the exception of these 2 hours and the hour building up to it, the hashtag is rarely used. This behaviour is modelled very well using our kernel, with a very high value for the shape parameter (s = 200) compared to the previous example (s = 11) which captures the abrupt trend in usage. In all cases, our GP model chosen by the evidence performs better than the Lag+ model, which is a very strong method if presented with the correct period. This further demonstrates the power of the Gaussian Process framework to deal with noise in the training data and to find the underlying function of the time variation of words.

We choose this, because we consider that NRMSE is not comparable between regression tasks due to the presence of large peaks in many time series, which distort the NRMSE values. The results are presented in Table 4 and show that our Gaussian Process model using model selection is best. Remarkably, it consistently outperforms the Lag+ model, which shows the effectiveness of the GP models to incorporate uncertainty. The GP-PS model does very well on its own. Although chosen in the model selection phase in only a third of the tasks, it performs consistently well across tasks because of its ability to model well all the periodic hashtags, be they smooth or abrupt. The GP-Lin model does worse than the average, mostly due to uni-modal time series which don’t have high occurrences in the testing part of the data. 5.3 Discussion Let us now turn to why the GP model is better for discovering periodicities than classic time series modelling methods. Measuring autocorrelation between points in the time series is used to discover the hidden periodicities in the data and in building AR models. However, the downsides of this method are: a) the incapacity of accurately finding the correct periods, because all integer multiples of the cor-0 100 200 300 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Lag Sample Autocorrelation Sample Autocorrelation Function Figure 6: Sample autocorrelation for #confessionhour 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 −70 −60 −50 −40 −30 −20 −10 Normalized Frequency (×π rad/sample) Power/frequency (dB/rad/sample) Periodogram Power Spectral Density Estimate Figure 7: Power spectral density for #raw rect period will be feasible candidates and b) it leads to incorrect conclusions when there is autocorrelated noise. The second case is illustrated in Figure 6 where #confessionhour shows autocorrelation but, as seen in Figure 5, lacks a periodic component.","Another approach to discovering periods in data is by computing the power spectral density. This has been used in the GP framework by Wilson and Adams (2013). For some time series, this gives a good indication of the period, as represented by a peak in the periodogram at that value. This fails to discover the correct period when dealing with large bursts like those exhibited by the #raw time series as shown in Figure 7. The lowest frequency spike corresponds to the correct period of 168, but also other candidate periods are shown as possible. The reason for this is its reliance on the Fourier Transform which decomposes the time series into a sum of oscillating patterns. These cannot model step-functions and other non-smoothly varying signals. A further discussion falls out of the scope and space constraints of this paper. 985 Tweet Time Prior Rank Prediction Bruins Goal!!!

In contrast to this classification approach for suggesting a tweet’s hashtag, information retrieval methods based on computing similarities between tweets are very hard to scale to large data (Zangerle et al., 2011).","We choose a simple model for prediction, the Naı̈ve Bayes Classifier. This method provides us with a straightforward way to incorporate our prior knowledge of how frequent a hashtag is in a certain time frame. This Naı̈ve Bayes model (NB-P) uses the forecasted values for the respective hour as the prior on the hashtags.","For comparison we use the Most Frequent (MF) baseline and the Naı̈ve Bayes with empirical prior (NB-E) which doesn’t use any temporal forecasting information. Because there are more than 1000 possible classes we show the accuracy of the correct hashtag being amongst the top 1,5 or 50 hashtags as well as the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The results are shown in Table 6.","The results show that incorporating the forecasted values as a more informative prior for classification we obtain better predictions. The improvements are consistent in all the Match values. Also, we highlight that a 9% improvement in the forecasting task carries over to about a 2% improvement in classification. We show a few examples in which the GP learned prior makes a difference in classification in Table 5 together with the values for both priors.","With these experiments, we highlighted that there are performance gains even with only adding a more informative prior that uses periodicity information. This motivates future work to add this information to discriminative classifiers thus avoiding the need MF NB-E NB-P Match@1 7.28% 16.04% 17.39% Match@5 19.90% 29.51% 31.91% Match@50 44.92% 59.17% 60.85% MRR 0.144 0.237 0.252 Table 6: Results for hashtag classification. for the Naı̈ve Bayes decomposition. The modelling framework offered by the GPs can accommodate classification, although scaling issues arise when using a large number of features or output classes. Efforts to scale GPs to a large number of variables are well understood (Candela and Rasmussen, 2005) and we will try to incorporate this in future work."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Periodicities play an important role when analysing the temporal dimension of text. We have presented a framework based on Gaussian Process regression for identifying periodic patterns and their parameters using only training data. We divided the periodic patterns into 2 categories: oscillating and periodic bursts by performing model selection using bayesian evidence. The periodicities we have discovered have proven useful in an NLP classification task.","In future work, we aim to model time continuously and to perform discriminative clustering in order to make better use of the learned periodicites. We will consider incorporating periodicities in other applications, such as topic models."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was funded by the Trendminer project, EU FP7-ICT Programme, grant agreement no.287863.
