Mikolov et al. (2013) show that these representations do capture syntactic and semantic regularities. Here, we push the interpretation of continuous space word representations further by demonstrating that vector offsets can be used to de-rive adjectival scales (e.g., okay < good < excellent). We evaluate the scales on the indirect answers to yes/no questions corpus (de Marneffe et al., 2010). We obtain 72.8% accuracy, which outperforms previous results (∼60%) on this corpus and highlights the quality of the scales extracted, providing further support that the continuous space word representations are meaningful."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["There has recently been a surge of interest for deep learning in natural language processing. In particular, neural network language models (NNLMs) have been used to learn distributional word vectors (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010): the models jointly learn an embedding of words into an n-dimensional feature space. One of the advantages put forth for such distributed representations compared to traditional n-gram models is that similar words are likely to have similar vector representations in a continuous space model, whereas the discrete units of an n-gram model do not exhibit any inherent relation with one another. It has been shown that the continuous space representations improve performance in a variety of NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, semantic role labeling, named entity resolution, parsing (Collobert and We-ston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012).","Mikolov et al. (2013) show that there are some syntactic and semantic regularities in the word representations learned, such as the singular/plural relation (the difference of singular and plural word vectors are equivalent: apple − apples ≈ car − cars ≈ family − families) or the gender relation (a mascu-line noun can be transformed into the feminine form: king − man + woman ≈ queen).","We extend Mikolov et al. (2013)’s approach and explore further the interpretation of the vector space. We show that the word vectors learned by NNLMs are meaningful: we can extract scalar relationships between adjectives (e.g., bad < okay < good < excellent), which can not only serve to build a sentiment lexicon but also be used for inference. To evaluate the quality of the scalar relationships learned by NNLMs, we use the indirect yes/no question answer pairs (IQAP) from (de Marneffe et al., 2010), where scales between adjectives are needed to infer a yes/no answer from a reply without explicit yes or no such as Was the movie good? It was excellent. Our method reaches 72.8% accuracy, which is the best result reported so far when scales are used."]},{"title":"2 Previous work","paragraphs":["We use the continuous word representations from (Mikolov et al., 2011), extracted from a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM), whose 1625 three-layer architecture is represented in Figure 1. s i g m o i d s of t m a x U W w(t) s(t-1) s(t) y(t) V Figure 1: The architecture of the RNNLM.","In the input layer, w(t) is the input word represented by 1-of- N coding at time t when the vocabulary size is N . When there are M nodes in the hidden layer, the number of connections between the input layer and the hidden layer is N M and the connections can be represented by a matrix U .","The hidden layer is also connected recurrently to the context s(t − 1) at time t − 1 (s(0) is initialized with small values like 0.1). The connections between the previous context and the hidden layer are represented by a matrix W . The dimensionality of the word representations is controlled by the size of W . The output of the hidden layer is s(t) = f (U w(t) + W s(t − 1)), where f is a sigmoid function.","Because the inputs of the hidden layer consist of the word w(t) and the previous hidden layer output s(t − 1), the current context of the RNN is influenced by the current word and the previous context. Therefore, we can regard that the continuous representations from the RNNLM exploit the context implicitly considering the word sequence information (Mikolov et al., 2010).","V is a N by M matrix representing the connections between the hidden layer and the output layer. The final output is y(t) = g(V s(t)), where g is a softmax function to represent the probability distribution over all the words in the vocabulary.","When the RNN is trained by the back propagation algorithm, we can regard the ith column vector of U as the continuous representation of the ith word in the vocabulary since the column was adjusted correspondingly to the ith element of w(t). Because the s(t) outputs of two input words will be similar when they have similar s(t − 1) values, the corresponding column vectors of the words will also be similar.","Mikolov et al. (2013) showed that constant vector offsets of word pairs can represent linguistic regularities. Let wa and wb denote the vectors for the words a and b, respectively. Then the vector offset of the word pair is wa − wb. If a and b are syntactically or semantically related, the vector offset can be interpreted as a transformation of the syntactic form or the meaning. The offset can also be added to another word vector c. The word vector nearest to wa − wb + wc would be related to word c with the syntactic or semantic difference as the difference between a and b, as it is the case for the king, man, and woman example, where king − man + woman would approximately represent king with feminine gender (i.e., queen). They also tried to use the continuous representations generated by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998). However, the results using LSA were worse because LSA is a bag-of-words model, in which it is difficult to exploit word sequence information as the context.","For all the experiments in this paper, we use the precomputed word representations generated by the RNNLM from (Mikolov et al., 2013). Their RNN is trained with 320M words from the Broadcast News data (the vocabulary size is 82,390 words), and we used word vectors with a dimensionality of 1,600 (the highest dimensionality provided).1","We standardized the dataset so that the mean and the variance of the representations are 0 and 1, respectively.2"]},{"title":"3 Deriving adjectival scales","paragraphs":["Here we explore further the interpretation of word vectors. Assuming that the transformation of form or meaning represented by the vector offset is linear, an intermediate vector between two word vectors would represent some “middle” form or meaning. For example, given the positive and superlative forms of an adjective (e.g., good and best), we expect that the word representation in the middle of","1","We also experimented with smaller dimensions, but consistent with the analyses in (Mikolov et al., 2013), the highest dimensionality gave better results.","2","http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/ĩmikolov/ rnnlm/word_projections-1600.txt.gz 1626 Input words Words with highest cosine similarities to the mean vector good:best better: 0.738 strong: 0.644 normal: 0.619 less: 0.609 bad:worst terrible: 0.726 great: 0.678 horrible: 0.674 worse: 0.665 slow:slowest slower: 0.637 sluggish: 0.614 steady: 0.558 brisk: 0.543 fast:fastest faster: 0.645 slower: 0.602 quicker: 0.542 harder: 0.518 Table 1: Words with corresponding vectors closest to the mean of positive:superlative word vectors.

To extract the “middle” word between two word vectors wa and wb, we take the vector offset wa −wb divided by 2, and add wb: wb +(wa −wb)/2. The result corresponds to the midpoint between the two words. Then, we find the word whose cosine similarity to the midpoint is the highest.","Table 1 gives some positive:superlative pairs and the top four closest words to the mean vectors, where the distance metric is the cosine similarity. The correct comparative forms (in bold) are quite close to the mean vector of the positive and superlative form vectors, highlighting the fact that there is some meaningful interpretation of the vector space: the word vectors are constituting a scale.","We can extend this idea of extracting an or-dering between two words. For any two semantically related adjectives, intermediate vectors extracted along the line connecting the first and second word vectors should exhibit scalar properties, as seen above for the positive-comparative-superlative triplets. If we take two antonyms (furious and happy), words extracted at the intermediate points x1, x2 and x3 should correspond to words lying on a scale of happiness (from “less furious” to “more happy”), as illustrated in Figure 2. Table 2 gives some adjectival scales that we extracted from the continuous word space, using antonym pairs. We picked three points with equal intervals on the line from the first to the second word (1st quarter, half and 3rd quarter). The extracted scales look quite reasonable: the words form a continuum from more negative to more positive meanings. x2 a=furious b=happy x1 x3 angry unhappy pleased Figure 2: An example of vectors with the highest cosine similarity to intermediate points on the line between furious and happy.","Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that the word vector space is interpretable: intermediate vectors between two word vectors represent a semantic continuum."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation: Indirect answers to yes/noquestions","paragraphs":["To evaluate the quality of the adjective scales learned by the neural network approach, we use the corpus of indirect answers to yes/no questions created by (de Marneffe et al., 2010), which consists of question-answer pairs involving gradable modifiers to test scalar implicatures. We focus on the 125 pairs in the corpus where both the question and answer contain an adjective: e.g., Is Obama qualified? I think he’s young.3","Each question-answer pair has","3","These 125 pairs correspond to the ‘Other adjective’ category in (de Marneffe et al., 2010). 1627 been annotated via Mechanical Turk for whether the answer conveys yes, no or uncertain. 4.1 Method The previous section showed that we can draw a line passing through an adjective and its antonym and that the words extracted along the line are roughly semantically ordered. To infer a yes or no answer in the case of the IQAP corpus, we use the following approach illustrated with the Obama example above (Figure 3). Using WordNet 3.1 (Fellbaum, 1998), we look for an antonym of the adjective in the question qualified: unqualified is retrieved. Since the scales extracted are only roughly ordered, to infer yes when the question and answer words are very close, we set the decision boundary perpendicular to the line connecting the two words and passing through the midpoint of the line.","Since the answer word is young, we check whether young is in the area including qualified or in the other area. We infer a yes answer in the for-mer case, and a no answer in the latter case. If young is on the boundary, we infer uncertain. If a sentence contains a negation (e.g., Are you stressed? I am not peaceful.), we compute the scale for stressedpeaceful and then reverse the answer obtained, similarly to what is done in (de Marneffe et al., 2010). qualified unqualified young Figure 3: An example of the decision boundary given qualified as the question and young as the answer.","Since a word can have multiple senses and different antonyms for the senses, it is important to select the most appropriate antonym to build a more accurate decision boundary.

(2010) propose an unsupervised approach where scales are learned from distributional information in a Web corpus; Mohtarami et al. (2011)’s model is similar to ours but uses word representations obtained by LSA and a word sense disambiguation system (Zhong and Ng, 2010) to choose antonyms. To compare with Mohtarami et al. (2011), we use macro-averaged precision and recall for yes and no. For the given metrics, our model significantly outperforms the previous ones (p < 0.05, McNemar’s test).","Mohtarami et al. (2011) present higher numbers obtained by replacing the answer words with their synonyms in WordNet. However, that approach fails to capture orderings. Two words of different degree are often regarded as synonyms: even though furious means extremely angry, furious and angry are synonyms in WordNet. Therefore using synonyms, the system will output the same answer irrespective of the order in the pair. Mohtarami et al.

Question words, antonyms, and answer words are displayed by bold, italic, and normal fonts, respectively. In the Obama example previously mentioned (Is Obama qualified? I think he’s young.), the question word is qualified and the answer word is young. In Figure 5, qualified is around (2,-20) while its antonym unqualified is around (-6,-24). Since young is around (-7,-8), we infer that young is semantically closer to unqualified which corroborates with the Turkers’ intuitions in this case.
