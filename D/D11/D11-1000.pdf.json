This year the conference is held from July 27th to 29th at the John McIntyre Conference Centre, Edinburgh, UK. This year EMNLP is, for the first time, not only a stand alone conference, but also an anchor conference to several workshops, that are held on July 30th and July 31st at the Informatics Forum, Edinburgh. This year’s conference continues the successful growing trend of previous years, attracting the largest number of papers to date for EMNLP and requiring a large organisational effort. I would like to thank all the people involved. Regina Barzilay from MIT and Mark Johnson from Macquarie University chaired a large scientific programme committee and introduced several innovations in the submission, selection and final scheduling of papers. Marie Candito, of Paris Diderot University, in collaboration with the ACL workshop chairs, selected the workshops, seven of which have been affiliated to EMNLP. They have received a large number of submissions and generated very interesting programmes. Special thanks go to the publication chair Wanxiang Che, from Harbin Institute of Technology, who had to deal with EMNLP’s now famous just-in-time schedule. We are very grateful to Bonnie Webber and Miles Osborne, from the University of Edinburgh, for accepting the demanding task of organising the largest and most complex EMNLP ever and allowing us to hold this conference in such a remarkable city. Thanks also go to Francesco Figari the webmaster, and to all the student volunteers that make the conference possible. Miles Osborne is also the contact person for an interesting affiliated event sponsored by Google and the Scottish and Informatics Computer Science Alliance: an Intense Summer School on Hadoop and Natural Language Processing, that will take place in Edinburgh for two days before the conference. Thanks also to David Yarowsky and Ken Church from SIGDAT who provided much useful information from past conferences and Graeme Hirst and Priscilla Rasmussen from ACL for their help and advice. This year’s EMNLP’s sponsors are Google, Yahoo and Textkernel. We thank them for their very welcome contributions, which were obtained by the efforts of the local organisers and of Massimilano Ciaramita (Google) and Stefan Riezler (Heidelberg University), our ACL sponsorship committee members for Europe. Finally, and foremost, thank to all the authors and conference attendees that have made and will make this conference a success and source of inspiration.

EMNLP 2011 received 628 submissions, a new record for the conference. The program committee, consisted of 20 area chairs and 545 PC members from Asia, Europe, and North America, was able to accept 149 papers in total (for an acceptance rate of 23.7%). Among them, 94 (i.e., 63%) of the papers were accepted for oral presentations, and 54 (i.e., 36%) for poster presentations. Submissions from PC chairs were handled by the general chair in an off-line procedure that applied considerably stricter acceptance requirements than for ordinary submissions. First and foremost, we would like to thank the authors who submitted their work to EMNLP 2011. The sheer number of submissions reflects how broad and active our field is. We are deeply indebted to the area chairs and the PC members for their hard work. They enabled us to make a wonderful program and to provide valuable feedback to the authors. We are extremely pleased that our invited speaker David McAllester has agreed to talk at EMNLP. Many thanks to local arrangements chairs, Bonnie Webber and Miles Osborne, who enabled the conference to be held in Edinburgh, one of the great intellectual cities of the world. We’d also like to thank the publications chair, Wanxiang Che, who put this volume together. We greatly benefited from advice from Hang Li and Lluı́s Màrquez who kindly shared with us their experience from EMNLP 2010. Special thanks to the general chair, Paola Merlo, who provided much valuable advice and assistance in the past months. We are grateful to David Yarowksy for assistance with a variety of aspects of the conference. Rich Gerber and the START team responded to our questions quickly, and helped us manage the large number of submissions smoothly; we would like to thank them as well. This year’s conference is innovative in several ways. The conference contains three additional plenary sessions compared to previous EMNLP conferences; these are used to highlight a diverse set of papers of interest to the entire EMNLP audience. We hope this will help counter the disciplinary fragmentation that some of us feel the standard multi-track conference structure encourages. For the first time, submitted papers could be optionally accompanied by up to 10MB of supplementary material, which could consist of data, code, and text. Papers can reference the supplementary material in much the same way a paper might refer to software or a tech report available from the authors’ web site (albeit without revealing the authors’ identities). Reviewers were encouraged but not required to view the supplementary material. A major challenge this year concerned undisclosed double submissions and plagiarism (especially selfplagiarism) involving papers accepted at other international conferences. We believe this is an issue that must addressed by the broader research community. Our community needs clear, well-publicised, standards on double and overlapping submissions, and also needs procedures for sharing information between relevant conferences to discourage double submission and self-plagiarism. But we don’t want to blow this issue out of proportion. By far the vast majority of EMNLP submissions described creative, innovative work that taken together substantially advances the field. The success of a conference is really a result of the great efforts of everybody involved. We hope that you enjoy this year’s conference in the historic city of Edinburgh!
