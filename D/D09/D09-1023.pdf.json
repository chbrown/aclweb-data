Here we take first steps toward such a “universal” decoder, making the following contributions:","Arbitrary feature model (§2): We define a single, direct log-linear translation model (Papineni et al., 1997; Och and Ney, 2002) that encodes most popular MT features and can be used to encode any features on source and target sentences, dependency trees, and alignments. The trees are op-tional and can be easily removed, allowing simulation of “string-to-tree,” “tree-to-string,” “tree-to-tree,” and “phrase-based” models, among many others. We follow the widespread use of log-linear modeling for direct translation modeling; the novelty is in the use of richer feature sets than have been previously used in a single model.","Decoding as QG parsing (§3–4): We present a novel decoder based on lattice parsing with quasi-synchronous grammar (QG; Smith and Eisner, 2006).2","Further, we exploit generic approximate inference techniques to incorporate arbitrary “non-local” features in the dynamic programming algorithm (Chiang, 2007; Gimpel and Smith, 2009).","Parameter estimation (§5): We exploit similar approximate inference methods in regularized pseudolikelihood estimation (Besag, 1975) with hidden variables to discriminatively and efficiently train our model.

The simplest are word-to-word features, estimated as the conditional probabilities p(t | s) and p(s | t) for s ∈ Σ and t ∈ T. Phrase-to-phrase features generalize these, estimated as p(t′","| s′",") and p(s′","| t′",") where s′","(respectively, t′",") is a substring of s (t).","A major difference between the phrase features used in this work and those used elsewhere is that we do not assume that phrases segment into disjoint parts of the source and target sentences","4","There are two conventional definitions of feature functions. One is to let the range of these functions be conditional probability estimates (Och and Ney, 2002). These estimates are usually heuristic and inconsistent (Koehn et al., 2003). An alternative is to instantiate features for different structural patterns (Liang et al., 2006; Blunsom et al., 2008). This offers more expressive power but may require much more training data to avoid overfitting. For this reason, and to keep training fast, we opt for the former convention, though our decoder can handle both, and the factorings we describe are agnostic about this choice. 220 (Koehn et al., 2003); they can overlap.5","Additionally, since phrase features can be any function of words and alignments, we permit features that consider phrase pairs in which a target word outside the target phrase aligns to a source word inside the source phrase, as well as phrase pairs with gaps (Chiang, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007).","Lexical translation features factor as in Eq. 3 (Tab. 2).

For bigrams and trigrams (used in this paper), the factoring is in Eq. 4 (Tab. 2). 2.3 Target Syntax There have been many features proposed that consider source- and target-language syntax during translation. Syntax-based MT systems often use features on grammar rules, frequently maximum likelihood estimates of conditional probabilities in a probabilistic grammar, but other syntactic features are possible. For example, Quirk et al. (2005) use features involving phrases and source-side dependency trees and Mi et al. (2008) use features from a forest of parses of the source sentence. There is also substantial work in the use of target-side syntax (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008). In addition, researchers have recently added syntactic features to phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models (Gimpel and Smith, 2008; Haque et al., 2009; Chiang et al., 2008).","In this work, we focus on syntactic features of target-side dependency trees, τt, along with the words t. These include attachment features that relate a word to its syntactic parent, and valence features. They factor as in Eq. 5 (Tab. 2). Features that consider only target-side syntax and words without considering s can be seen as “syntactic language model” features (Shen et al., 2008). 5 Segmentation might be modeled as a hidden variable in","future work.","gtrans(s, a, t) = Pm j=1 P","i∈a(j) flex (si, tj) (3)","+ P","i,j:1≤i<j≤m fphr (slast(i,j)","first(i,j), tj","i )","glm (t) = P","N∈{2,3} Pm+1","j=1 fN (tj","j−N+1) (4)","gsyn (t, τt) = Pm j=1 fatt (tj, j, tτ","t(j), τt(j))","+fval (tj, j, τ −1 t (j)) (5)","greor (s, τs, a, t, τt) = Pm j=1 P","i∈a(j) fdist (i, j) (6) gtree2(τs, a, τt) = m X j=1 fqg (a(j), a(τt(j)), j, τt(j)) (7) Table 2: Factoring of global feature collections g into f. xj","i denotes ⟨xi, . . . xj⟩ in sequence x = ⟨x1, . . .⟩. first(i, j) = mink:i≤k≤j (min(a(k))) and last(i, j) = maxk:i≤k≤j (max(a(k))). 2.4 Reordering Reordering features take many forms in MT. In phrase-based systems, reordering is accomplished both within phrase pairs (local reordering) as well as through distance-based distortion models (Koehn et al., 2003) and lexicalized reordering models (Koehn et al., 2007). In syntax-based systems, reordering is typically parameterized by grammar rules. For generality we permit these features to “see” all structures and denote them greor (s, τs, a, t, τt). Eq. 6 (Tab. 2) shows a factoring of reordering features based on absolute posi-tions of aligned words.","We turn next to the “backbone” model for our decoder; the formalism and the properties of its decoding algorithm will inspire two additional sets of features."]},{"title":"3 Quasi-Synchronous Grammars","paragraphs":["A quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (QDG; Smith and Eisner, 2006) specifies a conditional model p(t, τt, a | s, τs). Given a source sentence s and its parse τs, a QDG induces a probabilistic monolingual dependency grammar over sentences “inspired” by the source sentence and tree. We denote this grammar by Gs,τs; its (weighted) language is the set of translations of s. Each word generated by Gs,τs is annotated with a “sense,” which consists of zero or more words from s. The senses imply an alignment (a) between words in t and words in s, or equivalently, between nodes in τt and nodes in τs. In principle, any portion of τt may align to any portion of τs, but in practice we often make restrictions on the alignments to simplify computation. Smith and Eisner, for example, restricted |a(j)| for all words 221 tj to be at most one, so that each target word aligned to at most one source word, which we also do here.6","Which translations are possible depends heavily on the configurations that the QDG permits. Formally, for a parent-child pair ⟨tτt(j), tj⟩ in τt, we consider the relationship between a(τt(j)) and a(j), the source-side words to which tτt(j) and tj align. If, for example, we require that, for all j, a(τt(j)) = τs(a(j)) or a(j) = 0, and that the root of τt must align to the root of τs or to NULL, then strict isomorphism must hold between τs and τt, and we have implemented a synchronous CF dependency grammar (Alshawi et al., 2000; Ding and Palmer, 2005). Smith and Eisner (2006) grouped all possible configurations into eight classes and explored the effects of permitting different sets of classes in word alignment. (“a(τt(j)) = τs(a(j))” corresponds to their “parent-child” configuration; see Fig. 3 in Smith and Eisner (2006) for illustrations of the rest.) More generally, we can define features on tree pairs that factor into these local configurations, as shown in Eq. 7 (Tab. 2).","Note that the QDG instantiates the model in Eq. 2. Of the features discussed in §2, f lex , f att , f val , and f dist can be easily incorporated into the QDG as described while respecting the independence assumptions implied by the configuration features. The others (f phr , f 2, and f 3) are non-local, or involve parts of the structure that, from the QDG’s perspective, are conditionally independent given intervening material. Note that “nonlocality” is relative to a choice of formalism; in §2 we did not commit to any formalism, so it is only now that we can describe phrase and N -gram features as non-local. Non-local features will present a challenge for decoding and training (§4.3)."]},{"title":"4 Decoding","paragraphs":["Given a sentence s and its parse τs, at decoding time we seek the target sentence t∗",", the target tree τ ∗ t , and the alignments a∗","that are most probable, as defined in Eq. 1.7","(In §5 we will consider k-best and all-translations variations on this prob-","6","I.e., from here on, a : {1, . . . , m} → {0, . . . , n} where 0 denotes alignment to NULL.","7","Arguably, we seek argmaxt p(t | s), marginalizing out everything else.

It equates to finding the most probable derivation under the s/τs-specific grammar Gs,τs. We solve this by lattice parsing, assuming that an upper bound on m (the length of t) is known. The advantage offered by this approach (like most other grammar-based translation approaches) is that decoding becomes dynamic programming (DP), a technique that is both widely understood in NLP and for which practical, efficient, generic techniques exist. A major advantage of DP is that, with small modifications, summing over structures is also possible with “inside” DP algorithms. We will exploit this in training (§5). Efficient summing opens up many possibilities for training θ, such as likelihood and pseudo-likelihood, and provides principled ways to handle hidden variables during learning. 4.1 Translation as Monolingual Parsing We decode by performing lattice parsing on a lattice encoding the set of possible translations. The lattice is a weighted “sausage” lattice that permits sentences up to some maximum length l; l is derived from the source sentence length. Let the states be numbered 0 to l; states from ⌊ρl⌋ to l are final states (for some ρ ∈ (0, 1)). For every position between consecutive states j − 1 and j (0 < j ≤ l), and for every word si in s, and for every word t ∈ Trans(si), we instantiate an arc annotated with t and i. The weight of such an arc is exp{θ⊤","f }, where f is the sum of feature functions that fire when si translates as t in target position j (e.g., f lex (si, t) and f dist (i, j)).","Given the lattice and Gs,τs, lattice parsing is a straightforward generalization of standard context-free dependency parsing DP algorithms (Eisner, 1997). This decoder accounts for f lex , f att , f val , f dist , and f qg as local features.","Figure 1 gives an example, showing a German sentence and dependency tree from an automatic parser, an English reference, and a lattice representing possible translations. In each bundle, the arcs are listed in decreasing order according to weight and for clarity only the first five are shown.

Phrase-based systems such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) explicitly search for the highest-scoring string in which all source words are translated. Systems based on synchronous grammars proceed by parsing the source sentence with the synchronous grammar, ensuring that every phrase and word has an analogue in τt (or a deliberate choice is made by the decoder to translate it to NULL). In such systems, we do not need to use features to implement source-side coverage, as it is assumed as a hard constraint always respected by the decoder.","Our QDG decoder has no way to enforce coverage; it does not track any kind of state in τs apart from a single recently aligned word. This is a problem with other direct translation models, such as IBM model 1 used as a direct model rather than a channel model (Brown et al., 1993). This sacrifice is the result of our choice to use a conditional model (§2).","The solution is to introduce a set of coverage features gcov (a). Here, these include:","• A counter for the number of times each source","word is covered: f scov (a) = ∑n","i=1 |a−1","(i)|. • Features that fire once when a source word is covered the zth time (z ∈ {2, 3, 4}) and fire again all subsequent times it is covered; these are denoted f 2nd, f 3rd, and f 4th. • A counter of uncovered source words:","f sunc(a) = ∑n i=1 δ(|a−1","(i)|, 0). Of these, only f scov is local. 4.3 Non-Local Features The lattice QDG parsing decoder incorporates many of the features we have discussed, but not all of them. Phrase lexicon features f phr , language model features f N for N > 1, and most coverage features are non-local with respect to our QDG. Recently Chiang (2007) introduced “cube pruning” as an approximate decoding method that extends a DP decoder with the ability to incorporate features that break the Markovian independence assumptions DP exploits. Techniques like cube pruning can be used to include the non-local features in our decoder.8"]},{"title":"5 Training","paragraphs":["Training requires us to learn values for the param-","eters θ in Eq. 2.

Because outside algorithms can be automatically derived from inside ones, we discuss only inside algorithms in this paper; see Eisner et al. (2005). sag, 1975): p(t, τt | s, τs) ≈ p(t | τt, s, τs) × p(τt | t, s, τs) Plugging this into Eq. 9, we arrive at Eq. 10 (Tab. 3). The two parenthesized terms in Eq. 10 each have their own numerators and denominators (not shown). The numerators are identical to each other and to that in Eq. 9. The denominators are much more manageable than in Eq. 9, never requiring summation over more than two structures at a time. We must sum over target word sequences and word alignments (with fixed τt), and separately over target trees and word alignments (with fixed t). 5.1 Summing over t and a The summation over target word sequences and alignments given fixed τt bears a resemblance to the inside algorithm, except that the tree structure is fixed (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). Let S(j, i, t) denote the sum of all translations rooted at position j in τt such that a(j) = i and tj = t.","Tab. 3 gives the equations for this DP: Eq. 11 is the quantity of interest, Eq. 12 is the recursion, and Eq. 13 shows the base cases for leaves of τt.","Letting q = max0≤i≤n |Trans(si)|, this algorithm runs in O(mn2","q2",") time and O(mnq) space. For efficiency we place a hard upper bound on q during training (details in §6). 5.2 Summing over τt and a For the summation over dependency trees and alignments given fixed t, required for p(τt | t, s, τs), we perform “inside” lattice parsing with Gs,τs. The technique is the summing variant of the decoding method in §4, except for each state j, 224 the sausage lattice only includes arcs from j − 1 to j that are labeled with the known target word tj. If a is the number of arcs in the lattice, which is O(mn), this algorithm runs in O(a3",") time and requires O(a2",") space. Because we use a hard upper bound on |Trans(s)| for all s ∈ Σ, this summation is much faster in practice than the one over words and alignments. 5.3 Handling Non-Local Features So far, all of our algorithms have exploited DP, disallowing any non-local features (e.g., f phr , f N for N > 1, f zth, f sunc). We recently proposed “cube summing,” an approximate technique that permits the use of non-local features for inside DP algorithms (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). Cube summing is based on a slightly less greedy variation of cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) that maintains k-best lists of derivations for each DP chart item. Cube summing augments the k-best list with a residual term that sums over remaining structures not in the k-best list, albeit without their non-local features. Using the machinery of cube summing, it is straightforward to include the desired non-local features in the summations required for pseudo-likelihood, as well as to compute their approximate gradients.","Our approach permits an alternative to minimum error-rate training (MERT; Och, 2003); it is discriminative but handles latent structure and regularization in more principled ways. The pseudo-likelihood calculations for a sentence pair, taken together, are faster than (k-best) decoding, making SGA’s inner loop faster than MERT’s inner loop."]},{"title":"6 Experiments","paragraphs":["Our decoding framework allows us to perform many experiments with the same feature representation and inference algorithms, including combining and comparing phrase-based and syntax-based features and examining how isomorphism constraints of synchronous formalisms affect translation output. 6.1 Data and Evaluation We use the German-English portion of the Basic Travel Expression Corpus (BTEC). The corpus has approximately 100K sentence pairs. We filter sentences of length more than 15 words, which only removes 6% of the data. We end up with a training set of 82,299 sentences, a development set of 934 sentences, and a test set of 500 sentences. We evaluate translation output using case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), as provided by NIST, and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), version 0.6, with Porter stemming and WordNet synonym matching. 6.2 Features Our base system uses features as discussed in §2. To obtain lexical translation features gtrans (s, a, t), we use the Moses pipeline (Koehn et al., 2007). We perform word alignment using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), symmetrize the alignments using the “grow-diag-final-and” heuristic, and extract phrases up to length 3. We define f lex by the lexical probabilities p(t | s) and p(s | t) estimated from the symmetrized alignments. After discarding phrase pairs with only one target-side word (since we only allow a target word to align to at most one source word), we define f phr by 8 features: {2, 3} target words × phrase conditional and “lexical smoothing” probabilities × two conditional directions.","Bigram and trigam language model features, f 2 and f 3, are estimated using the SRI toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).","For our target-language syntactic features gsyn , we use features similar to lexicalized CFG events (Collins, 1999), specifically following the dependency model of Klein and Manning (2004). These include probabilities associated with in-dividual attachments (f att ) and child-generation valence probabilities (f val ). These probabilities are estimated on the training corpus parsed using the Stanford factored parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). The same probabilities are also included using 50 hard word classes derived from the parallel corpus using the GIZA++ mkcls utility (Och and Ney, 2003). In total, there are 7 lexical and 7 word-class syntax features.","For reordering, we use a single absolute distortion feature f dist (i, j) that returns |i−j| whenever a(j) = i and i, j > 0. (Unlike the other feature functions, which returned probabilities, this feature function returns a nonnegative integer.)","The tree-to-tree syntactic features gtree2 in our model are binary features f qg that fire for particular QG configurations. We use one feature for each of the configurations in (Smith and Eisner, 2006), adding 7 additional features that score configura-225 Phrase Syntactic Features: features: +fatt ∪ fval +fqg (base) (target) (tree-to-tree) (base) 0.3727 0.4458 0.4424 +fphr 0.4682 0.4971 0.5142 Table 4: Feature set comparison (BLEU). tions involving root words and NULL-alignments more finely. There are 14 features in this category. Coverage features gcov are as described in §4.2. In all, 46 feature weights are learned. 6.3 Experimental Procedure Our model permits training the system on the full set of parallel data, but we instead use the parallel data to estimate feature functions and learn θ on the development set.12","We trained using three it-erations of SGA over the development data with a batch size of 1 and a fixed step size of 0.01. We used l2 regularization with a fixed, untuned coefficient of 0.1. Cube summing used a 10-best list for training and a 7-best list for decoding unless otherwise specified.","To obtain the translation lexicon (Trans) we first included the top three target words t for each s using p(s | t) × p(t | s) to score target words. For any training sentence ⟨s, t⟩ and tj for which tj ̸∈ ⋃n","i=1 Trans(si), we added tj to Trans(si) for i = argmaxi′","∈I p(si′|tj) × p(tj|si′), where I = {i : 0 ≤ i ≤ n ∧ |Trans(si)| < qi}. We used q0 = 10 and q>0 = 5, restricting |Trans(NULL)| ≤ 10 and |Trans(s)| ≤ 5 for any s ∈ Σ. This made 191 of the development sentences unreachable by the model, leaving 743 sentences for learning θ.","During decoding, we generated lattices with all t ∈ Trans(si) for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, for every position. We used ρ = 0.9, causing states within 90% of the source sentence length to be final states. Between each pair of consecutive states, we pruned edges that fell outside a beam of 70% of the sum of edge weights (see §4.1; edge weights use f lex , f dist , and f scov ) of all edges between those two states. 6.4 Feature Set Comparison Our first set of experiments compares feature sets commonly used in phrase- and syntax-based translation. In particular, we compare the effects of combining phrase features and syntactic features. The base model contains f lex , glm , greor , and 12 We made this choice both for similarity to standard MT","systems and a more rapid experiment cycle. gcov . The results are shown in Table 4. The second row contains scores when adding in the eight f phr features. The second column shows scores when adding the 14 target syntax features (f att and f val ), and the third column adds to them the 14 additional tree-to-tree features ( f qg ). We find large gains in BLEU by adding more features, and find that gains obtained through phrase features and syntactic features are partially additive, suggesting that these feature sets are making complementary contributions to translation quality. 6.5 Varying k During Decoding For models without syntactic features, we constrained the decoder to produce dependency trees in which every word’s parent is immediately to its right and ignored syntactic features while scoring structures. This causes decoding to proceed left-to-right in the lattice, the way phrase-based decoders operate. Since these models do not search over trees, they are substantially faster during decoding than those that use syntactic features and do not require any pruning of the lattice. There-fore, we explored varying the value of k used during k-best cube decoding; results are shown in Fig. 2. Scores improve when we increase k up to 10, but not much beyond, and there is still a substantial gap (2.5 BLEU) between using phrase features with k = 20 and using all features with k = 5. Models without syntax perform poorly when using a very small k, due to their reliance on non-local language model and phrase features. By contrast, models with syntactic features, which are local in our decoder, perform relatively well even with k = 1. 6.6 QG Configuration Comparison We next compare different constraints on isomorphism between the source and target dependency 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0 5 10 15 20 Value of k for Decoding B L E U Phrase + Syntactic Phrase Syntactic Neither Figure 2: Comparison of size of k-best list for cube decoding with various feature sets. 226 QDG Configurations BLEU METEOR synchronous 0.4008 0.6949 + nulls, root-any 0.4108 0.6931 + child-parent, same node 0.4337 0.6815 + sibling 0.4881 0.7216 + grandparent/child 0.5015 0.7365 + c-command 0.5156 0.7441 + other 0.5142 0.7472 Table 5: QG configuration comparison. The name of each configuration, following Smith and Eisner (2006), refers to the relationship between a(τt(j)) and a(j) in τs. trees. To do this, we impose harsh penalties on some QDG configurations (§3) by fixing their feature weights to −1000. Hence they are permitted only when absolutely necessary in training and rarely in decoding.13","Each model uses all phrase and syntactic features; they differ only in the sets of configurations which have fixed negative weights.","Tab. 5 shows experimental results. The base “synchronous” model permits parent-child (a(τt(j)) = τs(a(j))), any configuration where a(j) = 0, including both words being linked to NULL, and requires the root word in τt to be linked to the root word in τs or to NULL(5 of our 14 configurations). The second row allows any configuration involving NULL, including those where tj aligns to a non- NULL word in s and its parent aligns to NULL, and allows the root in τt to be linked to any word in τs. Each subsequent row adds additional configurations (i.e., trains its θ rather than fixing it to −1000). In general, we see large improvements as we permit more configurations, and the largest jump occurs when we add the “sibling” configuration (τs(a(τt(j))) = τs(a(j))). The BLEU score does not increase, however, when we permit all configurations in the final row of the table, and the METEOR score in-creases only slightly. While allowing certain categories of non-isomorphism clearly seems helpful, permitting arbitrary violations does not appear to be necessary for this dataset. 6.7 Discussion We note that these results are not state-of-the-art on this dataset (on this task, Moses/MERT achieves 0.6838 BLEU and 0.8523 METEOR with maximum phrase length 3).14","Our aim has been to 13","In fact, the strictest “synchronous” model used the almost-forbidden configurations in 2% of test sentences; this behavior disappears as configurations are legalized. 14","We believe one cause for this performance gap is the generation of the lattice and plan to address this in future work by allowing the phrase table to inform lattice generation. illustrate how a single model can provide a controlled experimental framework for comparisons of features, of inference methods, and of constraints. Our findings show that phrase features and dependency syntax produce complementary improvements to translation quality, that tree-to-tree configurations (a new feature in MT) are helpful for translation, and that substantial gains can be obtained by permitting certain types of non-isomorphism. We have validated cube summing and decoding as practical methods for approximate inference.","Our framework permits exploration of alternative objectives, alternative approximate inference techniques, additional hidden variables (e.g., Moses’ phrase segmentation variable), and, of course, additional feature representations.
