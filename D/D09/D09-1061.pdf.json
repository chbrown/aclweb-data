Without knowing the user’s intention, a clustering algorithm will only group documents along the most prominent dimension, which may not be the one the user desires. To address this problem, we propose a novel way of incorporating user feedback into a clustering algorithm, which allows a user to easily specify the dimension along which she wants the data points to be clustered via inspecting only a small number of words. This distinguishes our method from existing ones, which typically require a large amount of effort on the part of humans in the form of document an-notation or interactive construction of the feature space. We demonstrate the viability of our method on several challenging sentiment datasets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text clustering is one of the most important applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A common approach to this problem consists of (1) computing the similarity between each pair of documents, each of which is typically represented as a bag of words; and (2) using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to partition the documents. The majority of existing work on text clustering has focused on topic-based clustering, where high accuracies can be achieved even for datasets with a large number of classes (e.g., 20 Newsgroups).","On the other hand, there has been relatively little work on sentiment-based clustering and the related task of unsupervised polarity classification, where the goal is to cluster (or classify) a set of documents (e.g., reviews) according to the polarity (e.g., “thumbs up” or “thumbs down”) expressed by the author in an unsupervised manner. Despite the large amount of recent work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining, much of it has focused on supervised methods (e.g., Pang et al. (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004), Mullen and Collier (2004)). One weakness of these existing supervised polarity classification systems is that they are typically domain- and language-specific. Hence, when given a new domain or language, one needs to go through the expensive process of collecting a large amount of annotated data in order to train a high-performance polarity classifier. Some recent attempts have been made to leverage existing sentiment corpora or lexica to automatically create annotated resources for new domains or languages. However, such methods require the existence of either a parallel corpus/machine translation engine for projecting/translating annotations/lexica from a resource-rich language to the target language (Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2008), or a domain that is “similar” enough to the target domain (Blitzer et al., 2007). When the target domain or language fails to meet this requirement, sentiment-based clustering or unsupervised polarity classification become appealing alternatives. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, these tasks are largely under-investigated in the NLP community. Turney’s (2002) work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification. However, while his system learns the semantic orientation of the phrases in a review in an unsupervised manner, this information is used to predict the polarity of a review heuristically.","Despite its practical significance, sentiment-based clustering is a challenging task. To illustrate its difficulty, consider the task of clustering a set of movie reviews. Since each review may contain a description of the plot and the author’s 580 sentiment, a clustering algorithm may cluster reviews along either the plot dimension or the sentiment dimension; and without knowing the user’s intention, they will be clustered along the most prominent dimension. Assuming the usual bag-of-words representation, the most prominent dimension will more likely be plot, as it is not un-common for a review to be devoted almost exclusively to the plot, with the author briefly expressing her sentiment only at the end of the review. Even if the reviews contain mostly subjective material, the most prominent dimension may still not be sentiment, due to the fact that many reviews are sentimentally ambiguous. Specifically, a reviewer may have negative opinions on the actors but at the same time talk enthusiastically about how much she enjoyed the plot. The presence of both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words in these reviews renders the sentiment dimension hidden (i.e., less prominent) as far as clustering is concerned. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the clustering algorithm will automatically produce a sentiment-based clustering of the reviews.","Hence, it is important for a user to provide feedback on the clustering process to ensure that the reviews are clustered along the sentiment dimension, possibly in an interactive manner. One way to do this would be to ask the user to annotate a small number of reviews with polarity information, possibly through an active learning procedure to minimize human intervention (Dredze and Crammer, 2008). Another way would be to have the user explicitly identify the relevant features (in our case, the sentiment-bearing words) at the beginning of the clustering process (Liu et al., 2004), or incrementally construct the set of relevant features in an interactive fashion (Bekkerman et al., 2007; Raghavan and Allan, 2007; Roth and Small, 2009). In addition, the user may supply constraints on which pairs of documents must or must not appear in the same cluster (Wagstaff et al., 2001), or simply tell the algorithm whether two clusters should be merged or split during the clustering process (Balcan and Blum, 2008). It is worth noting that many of these feedback mechanisms were developed by machine learning researchers for general clustering tasks and not for sentiment-based clustering.","Our goal in this paper is to propose a novel mechanism allowing a user to cluster a set of documents along the desired dimension, which may be a hidden dimension, with very limited user feedback. In comparison to the aforementioned feedback mechanisms, ours is arguably much simpler: we only require that the user select a dimension by examining a small number of features for each dimension, as opposed to having the user generate the feature space in an interactive manner or identify clusters that need to be merged or split. In particular, identifying clusters for merging or split-ting in Balcan and Blum’s algorithm may not be as easy as it appears: for each MERGE or SPLIT decision the user makes, she has to sample a large number of documents from the cluster(s), read through the documents, and base her decision on the extent to which the documents are (dis)similar to each other. Perhaps more importantly, our human experiments involving five users indicate that all of them can easily identify the sentiment dimension based on the features, thus providing suggestive evidence that our method is viable.","In sum, our contributions in this paper are three-fold. First, we propose a novel feedback mechanism for clustering allowing a user to easily specify the dimension along which she wants data points to be clustered and apply the mechanism to the challenging, yet under-investigated problem of sentiment-based clustering. Second, spectral learning, which is the core of our method, has not been applied extensively to NLP problems, and we hope that our work can increase the awareness of this powerful machine learning technique in the NLP community. Finally, we demonstrate the viability of our method not only by evaluating its performance on sentiment datasets, but also via a set of human experiments, which is typically absent in papers that involve algorithms for incorporating user feedback.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basics of spectral clustering, which will facilitate the discussion of our feedback mechanism in Section 3. We describe our human experiments and evaluation results on several sentiment datasets in Section 4, and present our conclusions in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Spectral Clustering","paragraphs":["When given a clustering task, an important ques-tion to ask is: which clustering algorithm should we use? A popular choice is k-means. Nevertheless, it is well-known that k-means has the major drawback of not being able to separate data points 581 that are not linearly separable in the given feature space (e.g., see Dhillon et al. (2004) and Cai et al. (2005)). Spectral clustering algorithms were developed in response to this problem with k-means. The central idea behind spectral clustering is to (1) construct a low-dimensional space from the original (typically high-dimensional) space while retaining as much information about the original space as possible, and (2) cluster the data points in this low-dimensional space. The rest of this sec-tion provides the details of spectral clustering. 2.1 Algorithm Although there are several well-known spectral clustering algorithms in the literature (e.g., Weiss (1999), Shi and Malik (2000), Kannan et al. (2004)), we adopt the one proposed by Ng et al. (2002), as it is arguably the most widely-used. The algorithm takes as input a similarity matrix S created by applying a user-defined similarity function to each pair of data points. Below are the main steps of the algorithm:","1. Create the diagonal matrix D whose (i,i)- th entry is the sum of the i-th row of S, and then construct the Laplacian matrix L = D−1/2","SD−1/2",".","2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of L.","3. Create a new matrix from the m eigenvectors that correspond to the m largest eigenvalues.1","4. Each data point is now rank-reduced to a point in the m-dimensional space. Normalize each point to unit length (while retaining the sign of each value).","5. Cluster the resulting data points using k-means.","In essence, each dimension in the reduced space is defined by exactly one eigenvector. The reason why eigenvectors with large eigenvalues are used is that they capture the largest variance in the data. As a result, each of them can be thought of as revealing an important dimension of the data. 2.2 Clustering with Eigenvectors As Ng et al. (2002) point out, “different authors still disagree on which eigenvectors to use, and how to derive clusters from them”. There are two common methods for deriving clusters using the eigenvectors. These methods will serve as our baselines in our evaluation.","1","For brevity, we will refer to the eigenvector with the n-th largest eigenvalue simply as the n-th eigenvector. Method 1: Using the second eigenvector only The first method is to use only the second eigenvector, e2, to partition the points. Besides reveal-ing one of the most important dimensions of the data, this eigenvector induces an intuitively ideal partition of the data — the partition induced by the minimum normalized cut of the similarity graph2",", where the nodes are the data points and the edge weights are the pairwise similarity values of the points (Shi and Malik, 2000). Clustering in a one-dimensional space is trivial: since we have a linearization of the points, all we need to do is to determine a threshold for partitioning the points. However, we follow Ng et al. (2002) and cluster using 2-means in this one-dimensional space. Method 2: Using m eigenvectors Recall from Section 2.1 that after eigendecomposing the Laplacian matrix, each data point is represented by m co-ordinates. In the second method, we simply use 2-means to cluster the data points in this m-dimensional space, effectively exploiting all of the m eigenvectors."]},{"title":"3 Our Approach","paragraphs":["As mentioned before, sentiment-based clustering is challenging, in part due to the fact that the reviews can be clustered along more than one dimension. In this section, we propose and incorporate a user feedback mechanism into a spectral clustering algorithm, which makes it easy for a user to specify the dimension along which she wants to cluster the data points.","Recall that our method first applies spectral clustering to reveal the most important dimensions of the data, and then lets the user select the desired dimension. To motivate the importance of user feedback, it helps to understand why the two baseline clustering algorithms described in Section 2.2, which are also based on spectral methods but do not rely on user feedback, may not always yield a sentiment-based clustering. To be-gin with, consider the first method, where only the second eigenvector is used to induce the partition. Recall that the second eigenvector reveals the most prominent dimension of the data. Hence, if sentiment is not the most prominent dimension (which can happen if the non-sentiment-bearing","2","Using the normalized cut (as opposed to the usual cut) ensures that the size of the two clusters are relatively balanced, avoiding trivial cuts where one cluster is empty and the other is full. See Shi and Malik (2000) for details. 582 words outnumber the sentiment-bearing words in the bag-of-words representation of a review), then the resulting clustering of the reviews may not be sentiment-oriented. A similar line of reasoning can be used to explain why the second baseline clustering algorithm, which clusters based on all of the eigenvectors in the low-dimensional space, may not always work well. Since each eigenvector corresponds to a different dimension (and, in particular, some of them correspond to non-sentiment dimensions), using all of them to represent a review may hamper the accurate computation of the similarity of two reviews as far as clustering along the sentiment dimension is concerned. In the rest of this section, we discuss the major steps of our user-feedback mechanism in detail. Step 1: Identify the important dimensions To identify the important dimensions of the given reviews, we take the top eigenvectors computed from the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix, which is in turn formed from the input similarity matrix. We compute the similarity between two reviews by taking the dot product of their feature vectors (see Section 4.1 for details on feature vector generation). Following Ng et al., we set the diagonal entries of the similarity matrix to 0. Step 2: Identify the relevant features Given the eigen-decomposition from Step 1, we first obtain the second through the fifth eigenvectors3",", which as mentioned above, correspond to the most important dimensions of the data. Then, we ask the user to select one of the four dimensions defined by these eigenvectors according to their relevance to sentiment. One way to do this is to (1) induce one partition of the reviews from each of the four eigenvectors, using a procedure identical to Method 1 in Section 2.2, and (2) have the user inspect the four partitions and decide which corresponds most closely to a sentiment-based clustering. The main drawback associated with this kind of user feedback is that the user may have to read a large number of reviews in order to make a decision. Hence, to reduce human effort, we employ an alternative procedure: we (1) identify the most informative features for characteriz-ing each partition, and (2) have the user inspect just the features rather than the reviews.","While traditional feature selection techniques such as log-likelihood ratio and information 3 The first eigenvector is not used because it is a constant","vector, meaning that it cannot be used to partition the data. gain can be applied to identify these informative features (see Yang and Pedersen (1997) for an overview), we employ a more sophisticated feature-ranking method that we call maximum margin feature ranking (MMFR). Recall that a maximum margin classifier (e.g., a support vector machine) separates data points from two classes while maximizing the margin of separa-tion. Specifically, a maximum margin hyperplane is defined by w · x − b = 0, where x is a feature vector representing an arbitrary data point, and w (a weight vector) and b (a scalar) are parameters that are learned by solving the following constrained optimization problem:","arg min 1","2 ∥w∥2","+ C ∑","i ξi subject to ci(w · xi − b) ≥ 1 − ξi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where ci ∈ {+1, −1} is the class of the i-th training point xi, ξi is the degree of misclassification of xi, and C is a regularization parameter that balances training error and model complexity.","We use w to identify the most informative features for a partition. Note that a feature with a large positive weight is strongly indicative of the positive class, whereas a feature with a large negative weight is strongly indicative of the negative class. In other words, the most informative features are those with large absolute weight values. We exploit this observation and identify the most informative features for a partition by (1) training an SVM classifier4","on the partition, where data points in the same cluster belong to the same class; (2) sorting the features according to the SVM-learned feature weights; and (3) generating two ranked lists of informative features using the top and bottom 100 features, respectively.","Given the ranked lists generated for each of the four partitions, the user will select one of the partitions/dimensions as most relevant to sentiment by inspecting as many features in the ranked lists as needed. After picking the most relevant dimension, the user will label one of the two feature lists associated with this dimension as POSITIVE and the other as NEGATIVE. Since each feature list represents one of the clusters, the cluster associated with the positive list is labeled POSITIVE and","4","All the SVM classifiers in this paper are trained using the SVMlight","package (Joachims, 1999), with the learning parameters set to their default values. 583 the cluster associated with the negative list is labeled NEGATIVE.","In comparison to existing user feedback mechanisms for assisting a clustering algorithm, ours requires comparatively little human intervention: we only require that the user select a dimension by examining a small number of features, as opposed to having the user construct the feature space or identify clusters that need to be merged or split as is required with other methods. Step 3: Identify the unambiguous reviews There is a caveat, however. As mentioned in the introduction, many reviews contain both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words. These ambiguous reviews are more likely to be clustered incorrectly than their unambiguous counterparts. Now, since the ranked lists of features are derived from the partition, the presence of these ambiguous reviews can adversely affect the identification of informative features using MMFR. As a result, we remove the ambiguous reviews before deriving informative features from a partition.","We employ a simple method for identifying unambiguous reviews. In the computation of eigenvalues, each data point factors out the orthogonal projections of each of the other data points with which they have an affinity. Ambiguous data points receive the orthogonal projections from both the positive and negative data points, and hence they have near zero values in the pivot eigenvectors. We exploit this important information. The basic idea is that the data points with near zero values in the eigenvectors are more ambiguous than those with large absolute values. As a result, we posit 250 reviews from each cluster whose corresponding values in the eigenvector are farthest away from zero as unambiguous, and induce the ranked list of features only from the resulting 500 unambiguous reviews.5 Step 4: Cluster along the selected dimension Finally, we employ the 2-means algorithm to cluster all the reviews along the dimension (i.e., the eigenvector) selected by the user, regardless of whether a review is ambiguous or not.","5","Note that 500 is a somewhat arbitrary choice. Underlying this choice is our assumption that a fraction of the reviews is unambiguous. As we will see in the evaluation sec-tion, these 500 reviews can be classified with a high accuracy; consequently, the features induced from the resulting clusters are also of high quality. Additional experiments reveal that the list of top-ranking features does not change significantly when induced from a smaller number of unambiguous reviews."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation4.1 Experimental SetupDatasets.","paragraphs":["We use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely-used movie review dataset [MOV] (Pang et al., 2002) as well as four datasets containing reviews of four different types of products from Amazon [books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT)] (Blitzer et al., 2007). Each dataset has 2000 labeled reviews (1000 positives and 1000 negatives). To illustrate the difference between topic-based clustering and sentiment-based clustering, we will also show topic-based clustering results on POL, a dataset created by taking all the documents from two sections of 20 Newsgroups, namely, sci.crypt and talks.politics.","To preprocess a document, we first tokenize and downcase it, and then represent it as a vector of unigrams, using frequency as presence. In addition, we remove from the vector punctuation, numbers, words of length one, and words that occur in only a single review. Following the common practice in the information retrieval community, we also exclude words with high document frequency, many of which are stopwords or domain-specific general-purpose words (e.g., “movies” in the movie domain). A preliminary examination of our evaluation datasets reveals that these words typically comprise 1–2% of a vocabulary. The decision of exactly how many terms to remove from each dataset is subjective: a large corpus typically requires more removals than a small corpus. To be consistent, we simply sort the vocabulary by document frequency and remove the top 1.5%. Evaluation metrics. We employ two evaluation metrics. First, we report results in terms of the accuracy achieved on the 2000 labeled reviews for each dataset. Second, following Kamvar et al. (2003), we evaluate the clusters produced by our approach against the gold-standard clusters using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). ARI ranges from –1 to 1; better clusterings have higher ARI values. 4.2 Baseline Systems Clustering using the second eigenvector only. As our first baseline, we adopt Shi and Malik’s approach and cluster the reviews using only the second eigenvector, e2, as described in Section 2.2. Results on POL and the five sentiment datasets are 584 Accuracy Adjusted Rand Index System Variation POL MOV KIT BOO DVD ELE POL MOV KIT BOO DVD ELE Baseline: 2nd eigenvector 93.7 70.9 69.7 58.9 55.3 50.8 0.76 0.17 0.15 0.03 0.01 0.01 Baseline: m eigenvectors 95.9 59.3 63.2 60.1 62.5 63.8 0.84 0.03 0.07 0.04 0.06 0.08 Our approach 93.7 70.9 69.7 69.5 70.8 65.8 0.76 0.17 0.15 0.15 0.17 0.10 Table 1: Results in terms of accuracy and Adjusted Rand Index for the six datasets. shown in row 1 of Table 1.6","As we can see, this baseline achieves an accuracy of 90% on POL, but a much lower accuracy (of 50–70%) on the sentiment datasets. The same performance trend can be observed with ARI. These results provide support for the claim that sentiment-based clustering is more difficult than topic-based clustering.","In addition, it is worth noting that the baseline achieves much lower accuracies and ARI values on BOO, DVD, and ELE than on the remaining two sentiment datasets. Since e2 cap-tures the most prominent dimension, these results suggest that sentiment dimension is not the most prominent dimension in these three datasets. In fact, this is intuitively plausible. For instance, in the book domain, positive book reviews typically contain a short description of the content, with the reviewer only briefly expressing her sentiment somewhere in the review. Similarly for the electronics domain: electronic product reviews are typically aspect-oriented, with the reviewer talk-ing about the pros and cons of each aspect of the product (e.g., battery, durability). Since the reviews are likely to contain both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words, the sentiment-based clustering is unlikely to be captured by e2. Clustering using top five eigenvectors. As our second baseline, we represent each data point using the top five eigenvectors (i.e., e1 through e5), and cluster them using 2-means in this 5-dimensional space, as described in Section 2.2. Hence, this can be thought of as an “ensemble” approach, where the clustering decision is collectively made by the five eigenvectors.","Results are shown in row 2 of Table 1. In comparison to the first baseline, we see improvements in accuracy and ARI for the three datasets on which the first baseline performs poorly (i.e., BOO, DVD, and ELE), with the most drastic improvement observed on ELE. On the other hand, performance on the remaining two senti-6","Owing to the randomness in the choice of seeds for 2-means, these and all other experimental results involving 2-means are averaged over ten independent runs. ment datasets deteriorates. These results can be attributed to the fact that for BOO, DVD, and ELE, e2 does not capture the sentiment dimension, but since some other eigenvector in the ensemble does, we see improvements. On the other hand, e2 has already captured the sentiment dimension in MOV and KIT; as a result, employing additional dimensions, which may not be sentiment-related, may only introduce noise into the computation of the similarities between the reviews. 4.3 Our Approach Human experiments. Unlike the two baselines, our approach requires users to specify which of the four dimensions (defined by the second through fifth eigenvectors) are most closely related to sentiment by inspecting a set of features derived from the unambiguous reviews for each dimension using MMFR. To better understand how easy it is for a human to select the desired dimension given the features, we performed the experiment independently with five humans (all of whom are computer science graduate students not affiliated with this research) and computed the agreement rate.","More specifically, for each dataset, we showed each human judge the top 100 features for each cluster according to MMFR (see Tables 4–6 for a snippet). In addition, we informed them of the intended dimension: for example, for POL, the judge was told that the intended clustering is Politics vs. Science. Also, if she determined that more than one dimension was relevant to the intended clustering, she was instructed to rank these dimensions in terms of their degree of relevance, where the most relevant one would appear first in the list.","The dimensions (expressed in terms of the IDs of the eigenvectors) selected by each of the five judges for each dataset are shown in Table 2. The agreement rate (shown in the last row of the table) was computed based on only the highest-ranked dimension selected by each judge. As we can see, perfect agreement is achieved for four of the five sentiment datasets, and for the remaining two datasets, near-perfect agreement is achieved. 585 Judge POL MOV KIT BOO DVD ELE 1 2,3,4 2 2 4 3 3 2 2,4 2 2 4 3 3 3 4 2,4 4 4 3 3 4 2,3 2 2 4 3 3,4 5 2 2 2 4 3 3 Agr 80% 100% 80% 100% 100% 100% Table 2: Human agreement rate. POL MOV KIT BOO DVD ELE Acc 99.8 87.0 87.6 86.2 87.4 77.6 Table 3: Accuracies on unambiguous documents. These results together with the fact that it took 5– 6 minutes to identify the relevant dimension, indicate that asking a human to determine the intended dimension based on solely the “informative” features is a viable task. Clustering results. Next, we cluster all 2000 documents for each dataset using the dimension selected by the majority of the human judges. The clustering results are shown in row 3 of Table 1. In comparison to the better baseline for each dataset, we see that our approach performs substantially better on BOO, DVD and ELE, at almost the same level on MOV and KIT, but slightly worse on POL. Note that the improvements observed for BOO, DVD and ELE can be attributed to the failure of e2 to capture the sentiment dimension. Perhaps most importantly, by exploiting human feedback, our approach has achieved more stable performance across the datasets than the baselines, with accuracies ranging from 65.8% to 93.7% and ARI ranging from 0.10 to 0.76. Role of unambiguous documents. Recall that the features with the largest MMFR were computed from the unambiguous documents only. To get an intuitive understanding of the role of unambiguous documents in our approach, we show in Table 3 the accuracy when the unambiguous documents in each dataset were clustered using the eigenvector selected by the majority of the judges. As we can see, the accuracy of each dataset is higher than the corresponding accuracy shown in row 3 of Table 1. In fact, an accuracy of more than 85% was achieved on all but one dataset. This suggests that our method of identifying unambiguous documents is useful.","Note that it is crucial to be able to achieve a high accuracy on the unambiguous documents: if clustering accuracy is low, the features induced from the clusters may not be an accurate representation of the corresponding dimension, and the human judge may have a difficult time identifying the intended dimension. In fact, some human judges reported difficulty in identifying the correct dimension for the ELE dataset, and this can be attributed in part to the low accuracy achieved on the unambiguous documents. Features as summary. Recall that the method we proposed represents each dimension with a small number of features and asks a user to select the desired dimension by inspecting the corresponding feature lists. In other words, each feature list serves as a “summary” of its corresponding dimension, and inspecting the features induced for each dimension can give us insights into the different dimensions of a dataset. Hence, if a user is not sure how she wants the data points to be clustered (due to lack of knowledge of the data, for instance), our automatically induced features may serve as an overview of the different dimensions of the data. To better understand whether these features can indeed provide a user with additional useful information about a dataset, we show in Tables 4–6 the top ten features induced for each cluster and each dimension for the six datasets. As an example, consider the MOV dataset. Inspecting the induced features, we can determine that it has a sentiment dimension (e2), as well as a humor vs. thriller dimension (e4). In other words, if we cluster along e2, we get a sentiment-based clustering; and if we cluster along e4, we obtain a genre-based (humor vs. thriller) clustering. User feedback vs. labeled data. Recall that our two baselines are unsupervised, whereas our approach can be characterized as semi-supervised, as it relies on user feedback to select the intended dimension. Hence, it should not be surprising to see that the average clustering performance of our approach is better than that of the baselines.","To do a fairer comparison, we conduct another experiment in which we compare our approach against a semi-supervised sentiment classification system, which uses transductive SVM as the underlying semi-supervised learner. More specifically, the goal of this experiment is to determine how many labeled documents are needed in order for the transductive learner to achieve the same level of performance as our approach. To answer this question, we first give the transductive learner access to the 2000 documents for each dataset as 586 POL MOV e2 e3 e4 e5 e2 e3 e4 e5 C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 serder beyer serbs escrow relationship production jokes starts armenian arabs palestinians serial son earth kids person turkey andi muslims algorithm tale sequences live saw armenians research wrong chips husband aliens animation feeling muslims israelis department ensure perfect war disney lives sdpa tim bosnia care drama crew animated told argic uci live strong focus alien laughs happen davidian ab matter police strong planet production am dbd@ura z@virginia freedom omissions beautiful horror voice felt troops holocaust politics excepted nature evil hilarious happened C2 C2 C2 C2 C2 C2 C2 C2 sternlight escrow standard internet worst sex thriller comic wouldn sternlight sternlight uucp stupid romantic killer sequences pgp algorithm des uk waste school murder michael crypto access escrow net bunch relationship crime supporting algorithm net employer quote wasn friends police career isn des net ac video jokes car production likely privacy york co worse laughs dead peter access uk jake didn boring sexual killed style idea systems code ai guess cute starts latest cryptograph pgp algorithm mit anyway mother violence entertaining Table 4: Top ten features induced for each dimension for the POL and MOV domains.

Multiple relevant dimensions. As seen from Table 2, some human judges selected more than one dimension for some datasets (e.g., 2,3,4 for POL; 2,4 for MOV; and 3,4 for ELE). However, we never took into account these “extra” dimensions in our previous experiments. To better understand whether these extra dimensions can help improve accuracy and ARI, we conduct another experiment in which we apply 2-means to cluster the documents in a space that is defined by all of the selected dimensions. The final accuracy turns out to be 95.9%, 70.9%, and 67.5% for POL, MOV, and ELE respectively, which is considerably better than using only the optimal dimension and suggests that the extra dimensions contain useful information."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Unsupervised clustering algorithms typically group objects along the most prominent dimension, in part owing to their objective of simultaneously maximizing inter-cluster similarity and intra-cluster dissimilarity. Hence, if the user’s intended clustering dimension is not the most prominent dimension, these unsupervised clustering algorithms will fail miserably. To address this problem, we proposed to integrate a novel user feedback mechanism into a spectral clustering algorithm, which allows us to mine the intended, possibly hidden, dimension of the data and produce the desired clustering. This mechanism differs from competing methods in that it requires very limited feedback: to select the intended dimension, the user only needs to inspect a small number of features. We demonstrated its viability via a set of human and automatic experiments with unsupervised sentiment classification, obtaining promising results.","In future work, we plan to explore several extensions to our proposed method. First, we plan to use our user-feedback method in combination with existing methods (e.g., Bekkerman et al. (2007)) for improving its performance. For instance, instead of having the user construct a relevant feature space from scratch, she can simply extend the set of informative features identified for the user-selected dimension. Second, since none of the steps in our method is specifically designed for sentiment classification, we plan to apply it to other non-topic-based text classification tasks. 588"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments on an earlier draft of the paper.
