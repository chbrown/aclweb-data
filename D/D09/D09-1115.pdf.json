It has been proven that such consensus translations are usually better than the output of individual systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).","In recent several years, the system combination methods based on confusion networks developed rapidly (Bangalore et al., 2001; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007; Rosti et al., 2007a; Rosti et al., 2007b; Rosti et al., 2008; He et al., 2008), which show state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks. A confusion network consists of a sequence of sets of candidate words. Each candidate word is associated with a score. The optimal consensus translation can be obtained by selecting one word from each set to maximizing the overall score.","To construct a confusion network, one first need to choose one of the hypotheses (i.e., candidate translations) as the backbone (also called “skeleton” in the literature) and then decide the word alignments of other hypotheses to the backbone. Hy-pothesis alignment plays a crucial role in confusion-network-based system combination because it has a direct effect on selecting consensus translations.","However, a confusion network is restricted in such a way that only 1-to-1 mappings are allowed in hypothesis alignment. This is not the fact even for word alignments between the same languages. It is more common that several words are connected to another several words. For example, “be capable of” and “be able to” have the same meaning. Although confusion-network-based approaches resort to inserting null words to alleviate this problem, they face the risk of producing degenerate translations such as “be capable to” and “be able of”.","In this paper, we propose a new system combination method based on lattices. As a more general form of confusion network, a lattice is capable of describing arbitrary mappings in hypothesis alignment. In a lattice, each edge is associated with a sequence of words rather than a single word. Therefore, we select phrases instead of words in each candidate set and minimize the chance to produce unexpected translations such as “be capable to”. We compared our approach with the state-of-the-art confusion-network-based system (He et al., 2008) and achieved a significant absolute improvement of 1.23 BLEU points on the NIST 2005 Chinese-to-English test set and 0.93 BLEU point on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English test set. 1105 He feels like apples He prefer apples He feels like apples He is fond of apples (a) unidirectional alignments He feels like apples He prefer apples He feels like apples He is fond of apples (b) bidirectional alignments He feels like ε apples ε prefer of is fond (c) confusion network he feels like apples ε prefer is fond of (d) lattice Figure 1: Comparison of a confusion network and a lattice."]},{"title":"2 Background2.1 Confusion Network and Lattice","paragraphs":["We use an example shown in Figure 1 to illustrate our idea. Suppose that there are three hypotheses: He feels like apples He prefer apples He is fond of apples","We choose the first sentence as the backbone. Then, we perform hypothesis alignment to build a confusion network, as shown in Figure 1(a). Note that although “feels like” has the same meaning with “is fond of”, a confusion network only allows for one-to-one mappings. In the confusion network shown in Figure 1(c), several null words ε are inserted to ensure that each hypothesis has the same length. As each edge in the confusion network only has a single word, it is possible to produce inappropriate translations such as “He is like of apples”.","In contrast, we allow many-to-many mappings in the hypothesis alignment shown in Figure 2(b). For example, “like” is aligned to three words: “is”, “fond”, and “of”. Then, we use a lattice shown in Figure 1(d) to represent all possible candidate translations. Note that the phrase “is fond of” is attached to an edge. Now, it is unlikely to obtain a translation like “He is like of apples”.","A lattice G = ⟨V, E⟩ is a directed acyclic graph, formally a weighted finite state automation (FSA), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. The nodes in a lattice are usually labeled according to an appropriate numbering to reflect how to produce a translation. Each edge in a lattice is attached with a sequence of words as well as the associated probability.","As lattice is a more general form of confusion network (Dyer et al., 2008), we expect that replac-ing confusion networks with lattices will further improve system combination. 2.2 IHMM-based Alignment Method Since the candidate hypotheses are aligned using Indirect-HMM-based (IHMM-based) alignment method (He et al., 2008) in both direction, we briefly review the IHMM-based alignment method first. Take the direction that the hypothesis is aligned to the backbone as an example. The conditional probability that the hypothesis is generated by the backbone is given by","p(e′","1J","|eI","1) = ∑ aJ 1 J","∏","j=1[p(aj |aj−1, I)p(e′","j |eaj )]l (1)","Where eI","1 = (e1, ..., eI ) is the backbone, e′J","1 =","(e′ 1, ..., e′","J ) is a hypothesis aligned to eI","1, and aJ","1 =","(a1, .., aJ ) is the alignment that specifies the posi-","tion of backbone word that each hypothesis word is","aligned to.

Since the alignments are in the same language, the distortion model favor monotonic alignments and penalize non-monotonic alignments. It is given in a intuitive way","c(d) = (1 + |d − 1|)−K , d = −4, ..., 6 (7) where K is tuned on held-out data.","Also the probability p0 of jumping to a null word state is tuned on held-out data. So the overall distortion model becomes","p(i|i′ , I) = {","p0 if i = null state","(1 − p0) · p(i|i′ , I) otherwise"]},{"title":"3 Lattice-based System CombinationModel","paragraphs":["Lattice-based system combination involves the following steps:","(1) Collect the hypotheses from the candidate systems.","(2) Choose the backbone from the hypotheses. This is performed using a sentence-level Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) method. The hypothesis with the minimum cost of edits against all hypotheses is selected.

First, each pair is aligned in both directions using the IHMM-based alignment method. In the IHMM alignment model, bilingual dictionaries in both directions are indispensable. Then, we apply a grow-diag-final algorithm which is widely used in bilingual phrase extraction (Koehn et al., 2003) to monolingual alignments. The bidirectional alignments are combined to one resorting to the grow-diag-final algorithm, allowing n-to-n mappings.","(4)Normalize the alignment pairs. The word order of the backbone determines the word order of consensus outputs, so the word order of hypotheses must be consistent with that of the backbone. All words of a hypotheses are reordered according to the alignment to the backbone. For a word aligned to null, an actual null word may be inserted to the proper position. The alignment units are extracted first and then the hypothesis words in each unit are shifted as a whole.","(5) Construct the lattice in the light of phrase pairs extracted on the normalized alignment pairs. The expression ability of the lattice depends on the phrase pairs.","(6) Decode the lattice using a model similar to the log-linear model.","The confusion-network-based system combination model goes in a similar way. The first two steps are the same as the lattice-based model. The difference is that the hypothesis pairs are aligned just in one direction due to the expression limit of the confusion network. As a result, the normalized alignments only contain 1-to-1 mappings (Actual null words are also needed in the case of null alignment). In the following, we will give more details about the steps which are different in the two models. 1107"]},{"title":"4 Lattice Construction","paragraphs":["Unlike a confusion network that operates words only, a lattice allows for phrase pairs. So phrase pairs must be extracted before constructing a lattice. A major difficulty in extracting phrase pairs is that the word order of hypotheses is not consistent with that of the backbone.

In general, the following three conditions should be taken into consideration:","• A backbone word is aligned to null.

One backbone arc in a lattice can only span one backbone word. In contrast, all hypothesis words in an alignment unit must be packed into one hypothesis arc. First the lattice is initialized with a normalized alignment pair. Then given all other alignment pairs one by one, the lattice is modified dynamically by adding the hypothesis words of an alignment pair in a left-to-right fashion.","A toy instance is given in Figure 4 to illustrate the procedure of lattice construction. Assume the current inputs are: an alignment pair as in Figure 4 (a), and a lattice as in Figure 4 (b). The backbone words of the alignment pair are compared to the backbone words of the lattice one by one. The procedure is as follows:","• e1 is compared with e1. Since they are the same, the hypothesis arc ē′","4, which comes from the same node with e1 in the alignment pair, is compared with the hypothesis arc ē′","1, which comes from the same node with e1 in the lattice.

So a translation path contains all the nodes. While in lattice decoding, a translation path may skip some nodes as some hypothesis arcs may cross more than one backbone arc.","Similar to the features in Rosti et al. (2007a), the features adopted by lattice-based model are arc posterior probability, language model probability, the number of null arcs, the number of hypothesis arcs possessing more than one non-null word and the number of all non-null words. The features are combined in a log-linear model with the arc posterior probabilities being processed specially as follows: log p(e/f ) = Narc ∑ i=1 log ( Ns ∑ s=1 λsps(arc)) + ζL(e) + αNnullarc(e) + βNlongarc(e) + γNword(e) (9) where f denotes the source sentence, e denotes a translation generated by the lattice-based system, Narc is the number of arcs the path of e covers, Ns is the number of candidate systems and λs is the weight of system s. ζ is the language model weight and L(e) is the LM log-probability. Nnullarcs(e) is the number of the arcs which only contain a null word, and Nlongarc(e) is the number of the arcs which store more than one non-null word. The above two numbers are gotten by counting both backbone arcs and hypothesis arcs. α and β are the corresponding weights of the numbers, respectively. Nword(e) is the non-null word number and γ is its weight.","Each arc has different confidences concerned with different systems, and the confidence of system s is denoted by ps(arc). ps(arc) is increased by 1110 1/(k + 1) if the hypothesis ranking k in the system s contains the arc (Rosti et al., 2007a; He et al., 2008).","Cube pruning algorithm with beam search is employed to search for the consensus output (Huang and Chiang, 2005).

The translation of System C is selected as the backbone. From Table 3, we can see that because of 1-to-1 mappings, “Russia” is aligned to “Russian” and “’s” to “null” in the IHMM-based model, which leads to the error translation “Russian 1111 Source:                         SystemA: Russia merger of state-owned oil company and the state-run gas company in Russia SystemB: Russia ’s state-owned oil company is working with Russia ’s state-run gas company mergers SystemC: Russian state-run oil company is combined with the Russian state-run gas company SystemD: Russia ’s state-owned oil companies are combined with Russia ’s state-run gas company IHMM: Russian ’s state-owned oil company working with Russia ’s state-run gas company Lattice: Russia ’s state-owned oil company is combined with the Russian state-run gas company Table 3: A real translation example ’s”. Instead, “Russia ’s” is together aligned to ”Russian” in the lattice-based model. Also due to 1-to-1 mappings, null word aligned to “is” is inserted. As a result, “is” is missed in the output of IHMM-based model. In contrast, in the lattice-based system, “is working with” are aligned to “is combined with”, forming a phrase pair. 6.2 Effect of Dictionary Scale The dictionary is important to the semantic similarity model in IHMM-based alignment method. We evaluated the effect of the dictionary scale by using dictionaries extracted on different data sets. The dictionaries were respectively extracted on similar data sets: 30K sentence pairs, 60K sentence pairs, 289K sentence pairs (FBIS corpus) and 2500K sentence pairs. The results are illustrated in Table 4. In order to demonstrate the effect of the dictionary size clearly, the interpolation factor of similarity model was all set to α = 0.1.","From Table 4, we can see that when the corpus size rise from 30k to 60k, the improvements were not obvious both on the dev set and on the test set. As the corpus was expanded to 289K, although on the dev set, the result was only 0.2 BLEU point higher, on the test set, it was 0.63 BLEU point higher. As the corpus size was up to 2500K, the BLEU scores both on the dev and test sets declined. The reason is that, on one hand, there are more noise on the 2500K sentence pairs; on the other hand, the 289K sentence pairs cover most of the words appear-ing on the test set. So we can conclude that in order to get better results, the dictionary scale must be up to some certain scale. If the dictionary is much smaller, the result will be impacted dramatically.

So the two similarity models decide the translation probability together and the proportion is controlled by the interpolation factor. We evaluated the effect of the two similarity models by varying the interpolation factor α.","We used the dictionaries extracted on the FBIS data set. The result is shown in Table 5.
