A weighted hypergraph also defines a probability or other weight for each tree, and can be used to represent the hypothesis space considered (for a given input) by a monolingual parser or a tree-based translation system, e.g., tree to string (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006), string to tree (Galley et al., 2006), tree to tree (Eisner, 2003), or string to string with latent tree structures (Chiang, 2007).","∗","This research was partially supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s GALE program via Contract No HR0011-06-2-0001. We are grateful to Sanjeev Khudanpur for early guidance and regular discussions.","Given a hypergraph, we are often interested in computing some quantities over it using dynamic programming algorithms. For example, we may want to run the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable derivation tree in the hypergraph, or the k most probable trees. Semiring-weighted logic programming is a general framework to specify these algorithms (Pereira and Warren, 1983; Shieber et al., 1994; Goodman, 1999; Eisner et al., 2005; Lopez, 2009). Goodman (1999) describes many useful semirings (e.g., Viterbi, inside, and Viterbi-n-best). While most of these semirings are used in “testing” (i.e., decoding), we are mainly interested in the semirings that are useful for “training” (i.e., parameter estimation). The expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002), originally proposed for finite-state machines, is one such “training” semiring, and can be used to compute feature expectations for the Estep of the EM algorithm, or gradients of the like-lihood function for gradient descent.","In this paper, we apply the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) to a hypergraph (or packed forest) rather than just a lattice. We then propose a novel second-order expectation semiring, nicknamed the “variance semiring.”","The original first-order expectation semiring allows us to efficiently compute a vector of first-order statistics (expectations; first derivatives) on the set of paths in a lattice or the set of trees in a hypergraph. The second-order expectation semiring additionally computes a matrix of second-order statistics (expectations of products; second derivatives (Hessian); derivatives of expectations).","We present details on how to compute many interesting quantities over the hypergraph using the expectation and variance semirings. These quantities include expected hypothesis length, feature expectation, entropy, cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayes risk, variance of hypothesis length, gradient of entropy and Bayes risk, covariance and Hessian matrix, and so on. The variance semiring is essential for many interesting training paradigms such as deterministic 40 annealing (Rose, 1998), minimum risk (Smith and Eisner, 2006), active and semi-supervised learning (Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004; Jiao et al., 2006). In these settings, we must compute the gradient of entropy or risk. The semirings can also be used for second-order gradient optimization algorithms.","We implement the expectation and variance semirings in Joshua (Li et al., 2009a), and demonstrate their practical benefit by using minimum-risk training to improve Hiero (Chiang, 2007)."]},{"title":"2 Semiring Parsing on Hypergraphs","paragraphs":["We use a specific tree-based system called Hiero (Chiang, 2007) as an example, although the discussion is general for any systems that use a hypergraph to represent the hypothesis space. 2.1 Hierarchical Machine Translation In Hiero, a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) is extracted from automatically word-aligned corpora. An illustrative grammar rule for Chinese-to-English translation is X → ⟨ X0 X1 , X1 of X0 ⟩ , where the Chinese word means of, and the alignment, encoded via subscripts on the nonterminals, causes the two phrases around to be reordered around of in the translation. Given a source sentence, Hiero uses a CKY parser to generate a hypergraph, encoding many derivation trees along with the translation strings. 2.2 Hypergraphs Formally, a hypergraph is a pair ⟨V, E⟩, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of hyperedges, with each hyperedge connecting a set of antecedent nodes to a single consequent node.1","In parsing parlance, a node corresponds to an item in the chart (which specifies aligned spans of input and output together with a nonterminal label). The root node corresponds to the goal item. A hyperedge represents an SCFG rule that has been “instantiated” at a particular position, so that the nonterminals on the right and left sides have been replaced by particular antecedent and consequent items; this corresponds to storage of backpointers in the chart.","We write T (e) to denote the set of antecedent nodes of a hyperedge e.

When generating the hypergraph, a trigram language model is integrated. Rectangles represent items, where each item is identified by the non-terminal symbol, source span, and left- and right-side language model states. An item has one or more incoming hyperedges. A hyperedge consists of a rule, and a pointer to an antecedent item for each non-terminal symbol in the rule. set of incoming hyperedges of node v (i.e., hyperedges of which v is the consequent), which represent different ways of deriving v. Figure 1 shows a simple Hiero-style hypergraph. The hypergraph encodes four different derivation trees that share some of the same items. By exploiting this shar-ing, a hypergraph can compactly represent exponentially many trees.","We observe that any finite-state automaton can also be encoded as a hypergraph (in which every hyperedge is an ordinary edge that connects a single antecedent to a consequent). Thus, the methods of this paper apply directly to the simpler case of hypothesis lattices as well. 2.3 Semiring Parsing We assume a hypergraph HG, which compactly encodes many derivation trees d ∈ D. Given HG, we wish to extract the best derivations—or other aggregate properties of the forest of derivations. Semiring parsing (Goodman, 1999) is a general framework to describe such algorithms. To define a particular algorithm, we choose a semiring K and specify a “weight” ke ∈ K for each hyperedge e. The desired aggregate result then emerges as the total weight of all derivations in the hypergraph. For example, to simply count derivations, one can assign every hyperedge weight 1 in the semiring of ordinary integers; then each derivation also has weight 1, and their total weight is the number of derivations.","We write K = ⟨K, ⊕, ⊗, 0, 1⟩ for a semiring with elements K, additive operation ⊕, multi-41 plicative operation ⊗, additive identity 0, and multiplicative identity 1.

But Figure 2 sums over these derivations in time only linear on the size of the hypergraph. Its correctness relies on axiomatic properties of the semiring: namely, ⊕ is associative and commutative with identity 0, ⊗ is associative with two-sided identity 1, and ⊗ distributes over ⊕ from both sides.

Then r/Z is the expected hypothesis length. Example 2: r(d) evaluates the loss of d compared to a reference translation, using some additively decomposable loss function. Then r/Z is the risk (expected loss), which is useful in minimum-risk training. Example 3: r(d) is the number of times that a certain feature fires on d. Then r/Z is the expected feature count, which is useful in maximum-likelihood training. We will generalize later in Section 4 to allow r(d) to be a vector of features. Example 4: Suppose r(d) and s(d) are identical and both compute hypothesis length. Then the second-order statistic t/Z is the second moment of the length distribution, so the variance of hypothesis length can be found as t/Z − (r/Z)2",". 3.2 Computing the Quantities We will use the semiring parsing framework to compute the quantities (1)–(4). Although each is a sum over exponentially many derivations, we will compute it in O(|HG|) time using Figure 2.","In the simplest case, let K = ⟨R, +, ×, 0, 1⟩, and define ke = pe for each hyperedge e.

The reader can easily check these axioms (as well as the closure axioms in footnote 2).

The main intuition is that ⊗ can be used to build up ⟨p(d), p(d)r(d)⟩ inductively from the ke: if d decomposes into two disjoint subderivations d1, d2, then ⟨p(d), p(d)r(d)⟩ = ⟨p(d1)p(d2), p(d1)p(d2)(r(d1) + r(d2))⟩ = ⟨p(d1), p(d1)r(d1)⟩ ⊗ ⟨p(d2), p(d2)r(d2)⟩.

And the linear coefficients ke, as well as k̂, are computed entirely within the cheap semiring K. They are based on β and α values obtained by first running INSIDE(HG, K) and OUTSIDE(HG, K), which use only the ke part of the weights and ignore the more expensive xe.","It is noteworthy that the expectation semiring is not used at all by Figure 4. Although the return value ⟨k̂, x̂⟩ is in the expectation semiring, it is built up not by ⊕ and ⊗ but rather by computing k̂ and x̂ separately. One might therefore wonder why the expectation semiring and its operations are still needed. One reason is that the input to Figure 4 consists of hyperedge weights ⟨ke, xe⟩ in the expectation semiring—and these weights may well have been constructed using ⊗ and ⊕. For example, Eisner (2002) uses finite-state operations such as composition, which do combine weights entirely within the expectation semiring before their result is passed to the forward-backward algorithm. A second reason is that when we work with a second-order expectation semiring in Section 4.4 below, the k̂, β, and α values in Figure 4 will turn out to be elements of a first-order expectation semiring, and they must still be constructed by first-order ⊗ and ⊕, via calls to Figures 2–3.","Why does inside-outside work?

First “lift” P to obtain the first-order expectation semiring K def","= EP,R. Then lift this a second time to obtain the “nested” first-order expectation semiring EK,X = E(EP,R),(S×T ), where we equip X def","= S × T with the operations ⟨s1, t1⟩ + ⟨s2, t2⟩ def","= ⟨s1 + s2, t1 + t2⟩ and ⟨p, r⟩⟨s, t⟩ def","= ⟨ps, pt + rs⟩. The resulting first-order expectation semiring has elements of the form ⟨⟨p, r⟩, ⟨s, t⟩⟩. Table 4 shows that it is indeed isomorphic to EP,R,S,T , with corresponding elements ⟨p, r, s, t⟩.","This construction of the second-order semiring as a first-order semiring is a useful bit of abstract algebra, because it means that known properties of first-order semirings will also apply to second-order ones. First of all, we are immediately guaranteed that the second-order semiring satisfies the semiring axioms. Second, we can directly apply the inside-outside algorithm there, as we now see. 4.4 Inside-Outside Speedup for Second-Order Expectation Semirings Given a hypergraph weighted by a second-order expectation semiring EP,R,S,T . By recasting this as the first-order expectation semiring EK,X where K = EP,R and X = (S × T ), we can again apply INSIDE-OUTSIDE(HG, K, X) to find the total weight of all derivations.","For example, to speed up Section 3.2, we may define ⟨ke, xe⟩ = ⟨⟨pe, pere⟩, ⟨pese, perese⟩⟩ for each hyperedge e. Then the inside-outside algorithm of Figure 4 will compute ⟨k̂, x̂⟩ = ⟨⟨Z, r⟩, ⟨s, t⟩⟩, more quickly than the inside algorithm of Figure 2 computed ⟨Z, r, s, t⟩.","Figure 4 in this case will run the inside and outside algorithms in the semiring EP,R, so that ke, k̂, α, β, and ke will now be elements of P × R (not just elements of P as in the first-order case). Finally it finds x̂ = ∑","e kexe, where xe ∈ S × T .9","This is a particularly effective speedup over the inside algorithm when R consists of scalars (or small vectors) whereas S, T are sparse high-dimensional vectors.

In Case 1, we claimed that the same algorithm will compute either gradients ⟨Z, ∇Z⟩ or expectations ⟨Z, r⟩, if the hyperedge weights are set to ⟨pe, ∇pe⟩ or ⟨pe, pere⟩ respectively.12","This may seem wonderful and mysterious. We now show in two distinct ways why this follows from our setup of Section 3.1. At the end, we derive as a special case the well-known relationship between gradients and expectations in log-linear models. From Expectations to Gradients One perspective is that our semiring fundamentally finds expectations. Thus, we must be finding ∇Z by for-mulating it as a certain expectation r. Specifically, ∇Z = ∇ ∑","d p(d) = ∑","d ∇p(d) = to be rsT",", a matrix. However, when using this semiring to compute second derivatives (Case 2) or covariances, one may exploit the invariant that r = s, e.g., to avoid storing s and to compute r1s2 + s1r2 in multiplication simply as 2 · r1r2.","11","Or, if n > m, it is faster to instead use INSIDE-OUTSIDE(HG, ER,Rm",", Rn","× Rm×n","), swapping the second and third components of the 4-tuple and transposing the matrix in the fourth component. Algebraically, this changes nothing because ER,Rn",",Rm","×Rn×m and ER,Rm",",Rn","×Rm×n are isomorphic, thanks to symmetries in Table 2. This method computes the expectation of the gradient rather than the gradient of the expectation—they are equal.","12","Cases 2–3 relied on the fact that this relationship still holds even when the scalars Z, pe ∈ R are replaced by more complex objects that we wish to differentiate. Our discussion below sticks to the scalar case for simplicity, but would generalize fairly straightforwardly. Pearlmutter and Siskind (2007) give the relevant generalizations of dual numbers.","∑ d p(d)r(d) = r, provided that r(d) = (∇p(d))/p(d). That can be arranged by defining re def","= (∇pe)/pe.13","So that is why the input weights ⟨pe, pere⟩ take the form ⟨pe, ∇pe⟩. From Gradients to Expectations An alternative perspective is that our semiring fundamentally finds gradients. Indeed, pairs like ⟨p, ∇p⟩ have long been used for this purpose (Clifford, 1873) under the name “dual numbers.” Operations on dual numbers, including those in Table 1, compute a result in R along with its gradient. For example, our ⊗ multiplies dual numbers, since ⟨p1, ∇p1⟩ ⊗ ⟨p2, ∇p2⟩ = ⟨p1p2, p1(∇p2) + (∇p1)p2⟩ = ⟨p1p2, ∇(p1p2)⟩. The inside algorithm thus computes both Z and ∇Z in a single “forward” or “inside” pass—known as automatic differentiation in the forward mode. The inside-outside algorithm instead uses the reverse mode (a.k.a. back-propagation), where a separate “backward” or “outside” pass is used to compute ∇Z.","How can we modify this machinery to produce expectations r̄ given some arbitrary re of interest?

Of course, we can compute ⟨Z, r⟩ as explained in Section 3.2. Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence We may be interested in computing the cross-entropy or KL divergence between two distributions p and q. For example, in variational decoding for machine translation (Li et al., 2009b), p is a distribution represented by a hypergraph, while q, represented by a finite state automaton, is an approximation to p. The cross entropy between p and q is defined as","H(p, q) = − ∑ d∈D(p(d)/Zp) log(q(d)/Zq) (6)","= log Zq − 1 Zp ∑","d∈D p(d) log q(d) = log Zq − 1","Zp ∑","d∈D p(d)r(d) = log Zq − r","Zp 14 Unfortunately, it is intractable to compute the entropy of","the distribution over strings (each string’s probability is a sum","over several derivations).

The popular machine translation metric, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), is not additively decomposable, and thus we are not able to compute the expected loss for it. Tromble et al.

Our objective function could be computed with a first-order expectation semiring, but computing it along with its gradient requires a second-order one. 7.1 The Model p We assume a globally normalized linear model for its simplicity. Each derivation d is scored by","score(d) def = Φ(d) · θ = ∑","i Φi(d) θi (12) where Φ(d) ∈ Rm","is a vector of features of d. We then define the unnormalized distribution p(d) as p(d) = exp(γ · score(d)) (13) where the scale factor γ adjusts how sharply the distribution favors the highest-scoring hypotheses. 7.2 Minimum-Risk Training Adjusting θ or γ changes the distribution p. Minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) tries to tune θ to minimize the BLEU loss of a decoder that chooses the most probable output according to p. (γ has no effect.) MERT’s specialized linesearch addresses the problem that this objective function is piecewise constant, but it does not scale to a large number of parameters.","Smith and Eisner (2006) instead propose a differentiable objective that can be optimized by gradient descent: the Bayes risk R(p) of (7). This is the expected loss if one were (hypothetically) to use a randomized decoder, which chooses a hypothesis d in proportion to its probability p(d). If entropy H(p) is large (e.g., small γ), the Bayes risk is smooth and has few local minima. Thus, Smith and Eisner (2006) try to avoid local minima by starting with large H(p) and decreasing it gradually during optimization. This is called deterministic annealing (Rose, 1998). As H(p) → 0 (e.g., large γ), the Bayes risk does approach the MERT objective (i.e. minimizing 1-best error).The objective is","minimize R(p) − T · H(p) (14) where the “temperature” T starts high and is explicitly decreased as optimization proceeds. 7.3 Gradient Descent Optimization Solving (14) for a given T requires computing the entropy H(p) and risk R(p) and their gradients with respect to θ and γ. Smith and Eisner (2006) followed MERT in constraining their decoder to only an n-best list, so for them, computing these quantities did not involve dynamic programming. We compare those methods to training on a hypergraph containing exponentially many hypotheses. In this condition, we need our new second-order semiring methods and must also approximate BLEU (during training only) by an additively decomposable loss (Tromble et al., 2008).15","Our algorithms require that p(d) of (13) is multiplicatively decomposable. It suffices to define Φ(d) def","= ∑","e∈d Φe, so that all features are local to individual hyperedges; the vector Φe indicates which features fire on hyperedge e.

(2009) concurrently developed a method to maximize the expected n-gram counts on a hypergraph using gradient descent. Their objective is similar to the minimum risk objective (though without annealing), and their gradient descent optimization involves in algorithms in computing expected feature/n-gram counts as well as expected products of features and n-gram counts, which can be viewed as instances of our general algorithms with first- and second-order semirings. They focused on tuning only a small number (i.e. nine) of features as in a regular MERT setting, while our experiments involve both a small and a large number of features.","16","It is easy to verify that the gradient of a function f (e.g. entropy or risk) with respect to γ can be written as a weighted sum of gradients with respect to the feature weights θi, i.e.","∂f","∂γ = 1 γ ∑ i θi × ∂f","∂θ","i (16) 49 7.4 Experimental Results 7.4.1 Experimental Setup We built a translation model on a corpus for IWSLT 2005 Chinese-to-English translation task (Eck and Hori, 2005), which consists of 40k pairs of sentences. We used a 5-gram language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, trained on the bitext’s English using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). 7.4.2 Tuning a Small Number of Features We first investigate how minimum-risk training (MR), with and without deterministic annealing (DA), performs compared to regular MERT. MR without DA just fixes T = 0 and γ = 1 in (14). All MR or MR+DA uses an approximated BLEU (Tromble et al., 2008) (for training only), while MERT uses the exact corpus BLEU in training.","The first five rows in Table 5 present the results by tuning the weights of five features (θ ∈ R5","). We observe that MR or MR+DA performs worse than MERT on the dev set. This may be mainly because MR or MR+DA uses an approximated BLEU while MERT doesn’t. On the test set, MR or MR+DA on an n-best list is comparable to MERT. But our new approach, MR or MR+DA on a hypergraph, does consistently better (statistically significant) than MERT, despite approximating BLEU.17","Did DA help? For both n-best and hypergraph, MR+DA did obtain a better BLEU score than plain MR on the dev set.18","This shows that DA helps with the local minimum problem, as hoped. However, DA’s improvement on the dev set did not transfer to the test set. 7.4.3 Tuning a Large Number of Features MR (with or without DA) is scalable to tune a large number of features, while MERT is not. To achieve competitive performance, we adopt a forest reranking approach (Li and Khudanpur, 2009; Huang, 2008). Specifically, our training has two stages. In the first stage, we train a baseline system as usual. We also find the optimal feature weights for the five features mentioned before, using the method of MR+DA operating on a hypergraph. In the second stage, we generate a hypergraph for each sentence in the training data (which consists of about 40k sentence pairs), using the baseline 17 Pauls et al. (2009) concurrently observed a similar pat-","tern (i.e., MR performs worse than MERT on the dev set, but","performs better on a test set). 18 We also verified that MR+DA found a better objective","value (i.e., expected loss on the dev set) than MR.

Li and Khudanpur (2008)). For example, a specific bigram “the cat” can be a feature. Note that the total score by the baseline system is also a feature in the second-stage model. With these features and the 40k hypergraphs, we run the MR training to obtain the optimal weights.","During test time, a similar procedure is followed. For a given test sentence, the baseline system first generates a hypergraph, and then the hypergraph is reranked by the second-stage model. The last row in Table 5 reports the BLEU scores. Clearly, adding more features improves (statistically significant) the case with only five features. We plan to incorporate more informative features described by Chiang et al.
