When output variables are structured, annotation can be particularly difficult and time-consuming. For example, when training a conditional random field (Lafferty et al., 2001) to extract fields such asrent, contact, features, and utilities from apartment classifieds, labeling 22 instances (2,540 tokens) provides only 66.1% accuracy.1","Recent work has used unlabeled data and limited prior information about input features to bootstrap accurate structured output models. For example, both Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Mann and McCallum (2008) have demonstrated results better than 66.1% on the apartments task described above using only a list of 33 highly discriminative features and the labels they indicate. However, these methods have only been applied in scenarios in which the user supplies such prior knowledge before learning begins.","1","Averaged over 10 randomly selected sets of 22 instances.","In traditional active learning (Settles, 2009), the machine queries the user for only the labels of instances that would be most helpful to the machine. This paper proposes an active learning approach in which the user provides “labels” for input features, rather than instances. A labeled input feature denotes that a particular input feature, for example the word call, is highly indicative of a particular label, such as contact. Table 1 provides an excerpt of a feature active learning session.","In this paper, we advocate using generalized expectation (GE) criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2008) for learning with labeled features. We provide an alternate treatment of the GE objective function used by Mann and McCallum (2008) and a novel speedup to the gradient computation. We then provide a pool-based feature active learning algorithm that includes an option to skip queries, for cases in which a feature has no clear label. We propose and evaluate feature query selection algorithms that aim to reduce model uncertainty, and compare to several baselines. We evaluate our method using both real and simulated user experiments on two sequence labeling tasks. Compared to previous approaches (Raghavan and Allan, 2007), our method can be used for both classification and structured tasks, and the feature query selection methods we propose perform better.","We use experiments with simulated labelers on real data to extensively compare feature query selection algorithms and evaluate on multiple random splits. To make these simulations more realistic, the effort required to perform different labeling actions is estimated from additional experiments with real users.

ER adds a term to the objective function that encourages confident predictions on unlabeled data. Training of linear-chain CRFs with ER is described by Jiao et al. (2006)."]},{"title":"3 Generalized Expectation Criteria","paragraphs":["In this section, we give a brief overview of generalized expectation criteria (GE) (Mann and McCallum, 2008; Druck et al., 2008) and explain how we can use GE to learn CRF parameters with estimates of feature expectations and unlabeled data.","GE criteria are terms in a parameter estimation objective function that express preferences on the","2","10 is a default value that works well in many settings. 82 value of a model expectation of some function. Given a score function S, an empirical distribution p̃(x), a model distribution p(y|x; θ), and a constraint function Gk(x, y), the value of a GE criterion is G(θ) = S(Ep̃(x)[Ep(y|x;θ)[Gk(x, y)]]).","GE provides a flexible framework for parameter estimation because each of these elements can take an arbitrary form. The most important difference between GE and other parameter estimation methods is that it does not require a one-to-one correspondence between constraint functions Gk and model feature functions. We leverage this flexibility to estimate parameters of feature-rich CRFs with a very small set of expectation constraints.","Constraint functions Gk can be normalized so that the sum of the expectations of a set of functions is 1. In this case, S may measure the divergence between the expectation of the constraint function and a target expectation Ĝk. G(θ) = Ĝk log(E[Gk(x, y)]), (1) where E[Gk(x, y)] = Ep̃(x)[Ep(y|x;θ)[Gk(x, y)]].","It can be shown that the partial derivative of G(θ) with respect to parameter j is proportional to the predicted covariance between the model feature function Fj and the constraint function Gk.3 ∂ ∂θj G(θ) = Ĝk E[Gk(x, y)] × (2) ( Ep̃(x)[","Ep(y|x;θ)[Fj(x, y)Gk(x, y)] − Ep(y|x;θ)[Fj(x, y)]Ep(y|x;θ)[Gk(x, y)]]) The partial derivative shows that GE learns parameter values for model feature functions based on their predicted covariance with the constraint functions. GE can thus be interpreted as a bootstrapping method that uses the limited training signal to learn about parameters for related model feature functions. 3.1 Learning with feature-label distributions Mann and McCallum (2008) apply GE to a linear-chain, first-order CRF. In this section we provide an alternate treatment that arrives at the same objective function from the general form described in the previous section.","Often, feature functions in a first-order linear-chain CRF f are binary, and are the conjunction","3","If we use squared error for S, the partial derivative is the covariance multiplied by 2( Ĝk − E[Gk(x, y)]).","of an observational test q(x, i) and a label pair test","1{yi=y′",",yi+1=y′′","}.4","f (yi, yi+1, x, i) = 1{yi=y′ ,yi+1=y′′","}q(x, i) The constraint functions Gk we use here decompose and operate similarly, except that they only include a test for a single label. Single label constraints are easier for users to estimate and make GE training more efficient. Label transition struc-ture can be learned automatically from single label constraints through the covariance-based parameter update of Equation 2. For convenience, we can write Gyk to denote the constraint function that combines observation test k with a test for label y. We also add a normalization constant Ck = Ep̃(x)[∑","i qk(x, i)],","Gyk(x, y) = ∑ i 1","Ck 1{yi=y}qk(x, i) Under this construction the expectation of Gyk is the predicted conditional probability that the label at some arbitrary position i is y when the observational test at i succeeds, p̃(yi = y|qk(x, i) = 1; θ).","If we have a set of constraint functions {Gyk : y ∈ Y}, and we use the score function in Equation 1, then the GE objective function specifies the minimization of the KL divergence between the model and target distributions over labels conditioned on the success of the observational test. In general the objective function will consist of many such KL divergence penalties.","Computing the first term of the covariance in Equation 2 requires a marginal distribution over three labels, two of which will be consecutive, but the other of which could appear anywhere in the sequence. We can compute this marginal using the algorithm of Mann and McCallum (2008). As previously described, this algorithm is O(n|Y|3",") for a sequence of length n. However, we make the following novel observation: we do not need to compute the extra lattices for feature label pairs with Ĝyk = 0, since this makes Equation 2 equal to zero. In Mann and McCallum (2008), probabilities were smoothed so that ∀y Ĝyk > 0. If we assume that only a small number of labels m have non-zero probability, then the time complexity of the gradient computation is O(nm|Y|2","). In this paper typically 1 ≤m≤ 4, while |Y| is 11 or 13. 4 We this notation for an indicator function that returns 1","if the condition in braces is satisfied, and 0 otherwise. 83 In experiments in this paper, using this optimization does not significantly affect final accuracy.","We use numerical optimization to estimate model parameters. In general GE objective functions are not convex. Consequently, we initialize 0th-order CRF parameters using a sliding window logistic regression model trained with GE. We also include a Gaussian prior on parameters with σ2","= 10 in the objective function. 3.2 Learning with labeled features The training procedure described above requires a set of observational tests or input features with target distributions over labels. Estimating a distribution could be a difficult task for an annotator. Consequently, we abstract away from specifying a distribution by allowing the user to assign labels to features (c.f. Haghighi and Klein (2006) , Druck et al. (2008)). For example, we say that the word feature call has label contact. A label for a feature simply indicates that the feature is a good indicator of the label. Note that features can have multiple labels, as does included in the active learning session shown in Table 1. We convert an input feature with a set of labels L into a distribution by assigning probability 1/|L| for each l ∈ L and probability 0 for each l /∈ L. By assigning 0 probability to labels l /∈ L, we can use the speed-up described in the previous section. 3.3 Related Work Other proposed learning methods use labeled features to label unlabeled data. The resulting partially-labeled corpus can be used to train a CRF by maximizing MML. Similarly, prototype-driven learning (PDL) (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) optimizes the joint marginal likelihood of data labeled with prototype input features for each label. Additional features that indicate similarity to the prototypes help the model to generalize. In a previous comparison between GE and PDL (Mann and McCallum, 2008), GE outperformed PDL without the extra similarity features, whose construction may be problem-specific. GE also performed better when supplied accurate label distributions.","Additionally, both MML and PDL do not naturally generalize to learning with features that have multiple labels or distributions over labels, as in these scenarios labeling the unlabeled data is not straightforward. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem using a simple heuristic: when there are multiple choices for a token’s label, sample a label. In Section 5 we use this heuristic with MML, but in general obtain poor results.","Raghavan and Allan (2007) also propose several methods for learning with labeled features, but in a previous comparison GE gave better results (Druck et al., 2008). Additionally, the generalization of these methods to structured output spaces is not straightforward. Chang et al. (2007) present an algorithm for learning with constraints, but this method requires users to set weights by hand. We plan to explore the use of the recently developed related methods of Bellare et al. (2009), Graca̧ et al. (2008), and Liang et al. (2009) in future work. Druck et al. (2008) provide a survey of other related methods for learning with labeled input features."]},{"title":"4 Active Learning by Labeling Features","paragraphs":["Feature active learning, presented in Algorithm 1, is a pool-based active learning algorithm (Lewis and Gale, 1994) (with a pool of features rather than instances). The novel components of the algorithm are an option to skip a query and the notion that skipping and labeling have different costs. The option to skip is important when using feature queries because a user may not know how to label some features. In each iteration the model is retrained using the train procedure, which takes as input a set of labeled features C and unlabeled data distribution p̃. For the reasons described in Section 3.3, we advocate using GE for the train procedure. Then, while the iteration cost c is less than the maximum cost cmax, the feature query q that maximizes the query selection metric φ is selected. The accept function determines whether the labeler will label q. If q is labeled, it is added to the set of labeled features C, and the label cost clabel is added to c. Otherwise, the skip cost cskip is added to c. This process continues for N iterations. 4.1 Feature query selection methods In this section we propose feature query selection methods φ. Queries with a higher scores are considered better candidates. Note again that by features we mean observational tests qk(x, i). It is also important to note these are not feature selection methods since we are determining the features for which supervisory feedback will be most helpful to the model, rather than determining which features will be part of the model. 84","Algorithm 1 Feature Active Learning","Input: empirical distribution p̃, initial feature constraints","C, label cost clabel, skip cost cskip, max cost per iteration","cmax, max iterations N","Output: model parameters θ","for i = 1 to N do θ = train(p̃, C) c = 0 while c < cmax do","q = argmaxq","k φ(qk)","if accept(q) then","C = C ∪ label(q)","c = c + clabel","else","c = c + cskip","end if end while","end for","θ = train(p̃, C)","We propose to select queries that provide the largest reduction in model uncertainty. We notate possible responses to a query qk as ĝ. The Expected Information Gain (EIG) of a query is the expectation of the reduction in model uncertainty over all possible responses. Mathematically, IG is φEIG(qk) = Ep(ĝ|qk;θ)[Ep̃(x)[H(p(y|x; θ)− H(p(y|x; θĝ)]], where θĝ are the new model parameters if the response to qk is ĝ. Unfortunately, this method is computationally intractable. Re-estimating θĝ will typically involve retraining the model, and do-ing this for each possible query-response pair is prohibitively expensive for structured output models. Computing the expectation over possible responses is also difficult, as in this paper users may provide a set of labels for a query, and more generally ĝ could be a distribution over labels.","Instead, we propose a tractable strategy for reducing model uncertainty, motivated by traditional uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994). We assume that when a user responds to a query, the reduction in uncertainty will be equal to the Total Uncertainty (TU), the sum of the marginal entropies at the positions where the feature occurs.","φT U (qk) = ∑ i ∑","j qk(xi, j)H(p(yj|xi; θ)) Total uncertainty, however, is highly biased to-wards selecting frequent features. A mean uncertainty variant, normalized by the feature’s count, would tend to choose very infrequent features. Consequently we propose a tradeoff between the two extremes, called weighted uncertainty (WU), that scales the mean uncertainty by the log count of the feature in the corpus.","φW U (qk) = log(Ck) φT U (qk) Ck . Finally, we also suggest an uncertainty-based metric called diverse uncertainty (DU) that encourages diversity among queries by multiplying TU by the mean dissimilarity between the feature and previously labeled features. For sequence labeling tasks, we can measure the relatedness of features using distributional similarity.5","φDU (qk) = φT U (qk) 1 |C| ∑","j∈C 1−sim(qk, qj)","We contrast the notion of uncertainty described above with another type of uncertainty: the entropy of the predicted label distribution for the feature, or expectation uncertainty (EU). As above we also multiply by the log feature count. φEU (qk) = log(Ck)H(p̃(yi = y|qk(x, i) = 1; θ)) EU is flawed because it will have a large value for non-discriminative features.","The methods described above require the model to be retrained between iterations. To verify that this is necessary, we compare against query selection methods that only consider the previously labeled features. First, we consider a feature query selection method called coverage (cov) that aims to select features that are dissimilar from existing labeled features, increasing the labeled features’ “coverage” of the feature space. In order to compensate for choosing very infrequent features, we multiply by the log count of the feature.","φcov(qk) = log(Ck) 1 |C| ∑","j∈C 1 − sim(qk, qj) Motivated by the feature query selection method of Tandem Learning (Raghavan and Allan, 2007) (see Section 4.2 for further discussion), we consider a feature selection metric similarity (sim) that is the maximum similarity to a labeled feature, weighted by the log count of the feature.","φsim(qk) = log(Ck) max j∈C sim(qk, qj) 5 sim(qk, qj) returns the cosine similarity between context","vectors of words occurring in a window of ±3. 85 Features similar to those already labeled are likely to be discriminative, and therefore likely to be labeled (rather than skipped). However, insufficient diversity may also result in an inaccurate model, suggesting that coverage should select more useful queries than similarity.","Finally, we compare with several passive baselines. Random (rand) assigns scores to features randomly. Frequency (freq) scores input features using their frequency in the training data.","φfreq(qk) = ∑ i ∑","j qk(xi, j) Top LDA (LDA) selects the top words from 50 topics learned from the unlabeled data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).

The word feature is assigned its maximum rank across all topics.","φLDA(qk) = max t rankLDA(qk, t) This method will select useful features if the topics discovered are relevant to the task. A similar heuristic was used by Druck et al. (2008). 4.2 Related Work Tandem Learning (Raghavan and Allan, 2007) is an algorithm that combines feature and instance active learning for classification. The algorithm it-eratively queries the user first for instance labels, then for feature labels. Feature queries are selected according to their co-occurrence with important model features and previously labeled features. As noted in Section 3.3, GE is preferable to the methods Tandem Learning uses to learn with labeled features. We address the mixing of feature and instance queries in Section 4.3.","In order to better understand differences in feature query selection methodology, we proposed a feature query selection method motivated6","by the method used in Tandem Learning in Section 4.1. However, this method performs poorly in the experiments in Section 5.","Liang et al. (2009) simultaneously developed a method for learning with and actively selecting","6","The query selection method of Raghavan and Allan (2007) requires a stack that is modified between queries within each iteration. Here query scores are only updated after each iteration of labeling. measurements, or target expectations with associated noise. The measurement selection method proposed by Liang et al. (2009) is based on Bayesian experimental design and is similar to the expected information gain method described above. Consequently this method is likely to be intractable for real applications. Note that Liang et al. (2009) only use this method in synthetic experiments, and instead use a method similar to to-tal uncertainty for experiments in part-of-speech tagging. Unlike the experiments presented in this paper, Liang et al. (2009) conduct only simulated active learning experiments and do not consider skipping queries.","Sindhwani (Sindhwani et al., 2009) simultaneously developed an active learning method that queries for both instance and feature labels that are then used in a graph-based learning algorithm. They find that querying certain features outperforms querying uncertain features, but this is likely because their query selection method is similar to the expectation uncertainty method described above, and consequently non-discriminative features may be queried often (see also the discussion in Section 4.1). It is also not clear how this graph-based training method would generalize to structured output spaces. 4.3 Expectation Constraint Active Learning Throughout this paper, we have focussed on labeling input features. However, the proposed methods generalize to queries for expectation estimates of arbitrary functions, for example queries for the label distributions for input features, labels for instances (using a function that is non-zero only for a particular instance), partial labels for instances, and class priors. The uncertainty-based query selection methods described in Section 4.1 apply naturally to these new query types. Importantly this framework would allow principled mixing of different query types, instead of alternating between them as in Tandem Learning (Raghavan and Allan, 2007). When mixing queries, it will be important to use different costs for different annotation types (Vijayanarasimhan and Grauman, 2008), and estimate the probability of obtaining a useful response to a query. We plan to pursue these directions in future work. This idea was also proposed by Liang et al. (2009), but no experiments with mixed active learning were presented. 86"]},{"title":"5 Simulated User Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section we experiment with an automated oracle labeler. When presented an instance query, the oracle simply provides the true labels. When presented a feature query, the oracle first decides whether to skip the query. We have found that users are more likely to label features that are relevant for only a few labels. Therefore, the oracle labels a feature if the entropy of its per occurrence label expectation, H(p̃(yi = y|qk(x, i) = 1; θ)) ≤ 0.7. The oracle then labels the feature using a heuristic: label the feature with the label whose expectation is highest, as well as any label whose expectation is at least half as large.","We estimate the effort of different labeling actions with preliminary experiments in which we observe users labeling data for ten minutes. Users took an average of 4 seconds to label a feature, 2 seconds to skip a feature, and 0.7 seconds to label a token. We setup experiments such that each iteration simulates one minute of labeling by set-ting cmax = 60, cskip = 2 and clabel = 4. For instance active learning, we use Algorithm 1 but without the skip option, and set clabel = 0.7. We use N = 10 iterations, so the entire experiment simulates 10 minutes of annotation time.

This allows the design of improved interfaces that can further increase the speed of feature active learning. We built a prototype interface that allows the user to quickly browse many candidate features. The features are split into groups of five features each. Each group contains features that are related, as measured by distributional similarity. The features within each group are sorted according to the active learning metric. This interface, displayed in Figure 3, may be useful because features in the same group are likely to have the same label.","We conduct three types of experiments. First, a user labels instances selected by information density, and models are trained using ER. The instance labeling interface allows the user to label tokens quickly by extending the current selection one token at a time and only requiring a single keystroke to label an entire segment. Second, the user labels features presented one-at-a-time by weighted uncertainty, and models are trained using GE. To aid the user in understanding the function of the feature quickly, we provide several examples of the feature occurring in context and the model’s current predicted label distribution for the feature. Finally, the user labels features organized using the grid interface described in the previous paragraph. Weighted uncertainty is used to sort feature queries within each group, and GE is used to train models. Each iteration of labeling lasts two minutes, and there are five iterations. Retrain-ing with ER between iterations takes an average of 5 minutes on cora and 3 minutes on apartments. With GE, the retraining times are on average 6 minutes on cora and 4 minutes on apartments. Consequently, even when viewed with to-tal time, rather than annotation time, feature active learning is beneficial. While waiting for models to retrain, users can perform other tasks.","Figure 2 displays the results. User 1 labeled apartments data, while Users 2 and 3 labeled cora data.

In both simulated and real user experiments, active learning with features outperformed passive and active learning with instances. Finally, we proposed a new labeling interface that leverages the conciseness of feature queries. User experiments suggested that this grid interface can improve labeling efficiency."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Kedar Bellare for helpful discussions and Gaurav Chandalia for providing code.
