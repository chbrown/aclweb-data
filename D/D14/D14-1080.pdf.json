Recently, “depth in space” — as an orthogonal notion to “depth in time” — in RNNs has been investigated by stacking multiple layers of RNNs and shown empirically to bring a temporal hierarchy to the architecture. In this work we apply these deep RNNs to the task of opinion expression extraction formulated as a token-level sequence-labeling task. Experimental results show that deep, narrow RNNs outperform traditional shallow, wide RNNs with the same number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach outperforms previous CRF-based baselines, including the state-of-the-art semi-Markov CRF model, and does so without access to the powerful opinion lexicons and syntactic features relied upon by the semi-CRF, as well as without the standard layer-by-layer pre-training typically required of RNN architectures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Fine-grained opinion analysis aims to detect the subjective expressions in a text (e.g. “hate”) and to characterize their intensity (e.g. strong) and sentiment (e.g. negative) as well as to identify the opinion holder (the entity expressing the opinion) and the target, or topic, of the opinion (i.e. what the opinion is about) (Wiebe et al., 2005). Fine-grained opinion analysis is important for a variety of NLP tasks including opinion-oriented question answering and opinion summarization. As a result, it has been studied extensively in recent years.","In this work, we focus on the detection of opinion expressions — both direct subjective expressions (DSEs) and expressive subjective expressions (ESEs) as defined in Wiebe et al. (2005). DSEs consist of explicit mentions of private states or speech events expressing private states; and ESEs consist of expressions that indicate sentiment, emotion, etc., without explicitly conveying them. An example sentence shown in Table 1 in which the DSE “has refused to make any statements” explicitly expresses an opinion holder’s attitude and the The committee , as usual , has O O O B ESE I ESE O B DSE refused to make any statements . I DSE I DSE I DSE I DSE I DSE O Table 1: An example sentence with labels ESE “as usual” indirectly expresses the attitude of the writer.","Opinion extraction has often been tackled as a sequence labeling problem in previous work (e.g. Choi et al. (2005)). This approach views a sentence as a sequence of tokens labeled using the conventional BIO tagging scheme: B indicates the beginning of an opinion-related expression, I is used for tokens inside the opinion-related expression, and O indicates tokens outside any opinion-related class. The example sentence in Table 1 shows the appropriate tags in the BIO scheme. For instance, the ESE “as usual” results in the tags B ESE for “as” and I ESE for “usual”.","Variants of conditional random field (CRF) approaches have been successfully applied to opinion expression extraction using this token-based view (Choi et al., 2005; Breck et al., 2007): the state-of-the-art approach is the semiCRF, which relaxes the Markovian assumption inherent to CRFs and operates at the phrase level rather than the token level, allowing the in-corporation of phrase-level features (Yang and Cardie, 2012). The success of the CRF- and semiCRF-based approaches, however, hinges critically on access to an appropriate feature set, typically based on constituent and dependency parse trees, manually crafted opinion lexicons, named entity taggers and other preprocessing components (see Yang and Cardie (2012) for an up-to-date list).","Distributed representation learners provide a different approach to learning in which latent features are modeled as distributed dense vectors of hidden layers. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is one such learner that can operate on sequential data of variable length, which means it can also be applied as a sequence labeler. Moreover, bidirectional RNNs incorporate information from preceding as well as following tokens (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) while recent advances in word embedding induction (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et"]},{"title":"720","paragraphs":["al., 2013; Turian et al., 2010) have enabled more effective training of RNNs by allowing a lower dimensional dense input representation and hence, more compact networks (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mesnil et al., 2013). Finally, deep recurrent networks, a type of RNN with multiple stacked hidden layers, are shown to naturally employ a temporal hierarchy with multiple layers operating at different time scales (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013): lower levels capture short term interactions among words; higher layers reflect interpretations aggregated over longer spans of text. When applied to natural language sentences, such hierarchies might better model the multi-scale language effects that are emblematic of natural languages, as suggested by previous results (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013).","Motivated by the recent success of deep architectures in general and deep recurrent networks in particular, we explore an application of deep bidirectional RNNs — henceforth deep RNNs — to the task of opinion expression extraction. For both DSE and ESE detection, we show that such models outperform conventional, shallow (uni- and bidirectional) RNNs as well as previous CRF-based state-of-the-art baselines, including the semiCRF model.","In the rest of the paper we discuss related work (Section 2) and describe the architecture and training methods for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), bidirectional RNNs, and deep (bidirectional) RNNs (Section 3). We present experiments using a standard corpus for fine-grained opinion extraction in Section 4."]},{"title":"2 Related WorkOpinion extraction.","paragraphs":["Early work on fine-grained opinion extraction focused on recognizing subjective phrases (Wilson et al., 2005; Munson et al., 2005). Breck et al. (2007), for example, formulated the problem as a token-level sequence-labeling problem and apply a CRF-based approach, which significantly outperformed previous baselines. Choi et al. (2005) extended the sequential prediction approach to jointly identify opinion holders; Choi and Cardie (2010) jointly detected polarity and intensity along with the opinion expression. Reranking approaches have also been explored to improve the performance of a single sequence labeler (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Johansson and Moschitti, 2011). More recent work relaxes the Markovian assumption of CRFs to capture phrase-level interactions, significantly improving upon the token-level labeling approach (Yang and Cardie, 2012). In particular, Yang and Cardie (2013) propose a joint inference model to jointly detect opinion expressions, opinion holders and targets, as well as the relations among them, outperforming previous pipelined approaches. Deep learning. Recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990) constitute one important class of naturally deep architecture that has been applied to many sequential prediction tasks. In the context of NLP, recurrent neural networks view a sentence as a sequence of tokens and have been successfully applied to tasks such as language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2011) and spoken language understanding (Mesnil et al., 2013). Since classical recurrent neural networks only incorporate information from the past (i.e. preceding tokens), bidirectional variants have been proposed to incorporate information from both the past and the future (i.e. subsequent tokens) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997). Bidirectionality is especially useful for NLP tasks, since information provided by the following tokens is generally helpful (and sometimes essential) when making a decision on the current token.","Stacked recurrent neural networks have been proposed as a way of constructing deep RNNs (Schmidhuber, 1992; El Hihi and Bengio, 1995). Careful empirical investigation of this architecture showed that multiple layers in the stack can operate at different time scales (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013). Pascanu et al. (2013) explore other ways of constructing deep RNNs that are orthogonal to the concept of stacking layers on top of each other. In this work, we focus on the stacking notion of depth."]},{"title":"3 Methodology","paragraphs":["This section describes the architecture and training methods for the deep bidirectional recurrent networks that we propose for the task of opinion expression min-ing. Recurrent neural networks are presented in 3.1, bidirectionality is introduced in 3.2, and deep bidirectional RNNs, in 3.3. 3.1 Recurrent Neural Networks A recurrent neural network (Elman, 1990) is a class of neural network that has recurrent connections, which allow a form of memory. This makes them applicable for sequential prediction tasks with arbitrary spatio-temporal dimensions. Thus, their structure fits many NLP tasks, when the interpretation of a single sentence is viewed as analyzing a sequence of tokens. In this work, we focus our attention on only Elman-type networks (Elman, 1990).","In an Elman-type network, the hidden layer ht at time step t is computed from a nonlinear transforma-tion of the current input layer xt and the previous hidden layer ht−1. Then, the final output yt is computed using the hidden layer ht. One can interpret ht as an intermediate representation summarizing the past, which is used to make a final decision on the current input.","More formally, given a sequence of vectors {xt}t=1..T , an Elman-type RNN operates by computing the following memory and output sequences: ht = f (W xt + V ht−1 + b) (1) yt = g(U ht + c) (2) where f is a nonlinear function, such as the sigmoid function and g is the output nonlinearity, such as the"]},{"title":"721","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Recurrent neural networks.

W and V are weight matrices between the input and hidden layer, and among the hidden units themselves (connecting the previous intermediate representation to the current one), respectively, while U is the output weight matrix. b and c are bias vectors connected to hidden and output units, respectively. As a base case for the recursion in Equation 1, h0 is assumed to be 0.","Training an RNN can be done by optimizing a discriminative objective (e.g. the cross entropy for classification tasks) with a gradient-based method. Backpropagation through time can be used to efficiently compute the gradients (Werbos, 1990). This method is essentially equivalent to unfolding the network in time and using backpropagation as in feedforward neural networks, while sharing the connection weights across different time steps. The Elman-style RNN is shown in Figure 1, top left. 3.2 Bidirectionality Observe that with the above definition of RNNs, we have information only about the past, when making a decision on xt. This is limiting for most NLP tasks. As a simple example, consider the two sentences: “I did not accept his suggestion” and “I did not go to the rodeo”. The first has a DSE phrase (“did not accept”) and the second does not. However, any such RNN will assign the same labels for the words “did” and “not” in both sentences, since the preceding sequences (past) are the same: the Elman-style unidirectional RNNs lack the representational power to model this task. A simple way to work around this problem is to include a fixed-size future context around a single input vector (token). However, this approach requires tuning the context size, and ignores future information from outside of the context window. Another way to incorporate information about the future is to add bidirectionality to the architecture, referred as the bidirectional RNN (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997):","−→","h t = f (−→","W xt + −→","V −→","h t−1 + −→","b ) (3)","←−","h t = f (←−","W xt + ←−","V ←−","h t+1 + ←−","b ) (4)","yt = g(U→−→ h t + U←←−","h t + c) (5) where −→","W , −→","V and −→","b are the forward weight matrices and bias vector as before; ←−","W , ←−","V and ←−","b are their backward counterparts; U→, U← are the output matrices; and c is the output bias.1","Again, we assume −→ h 0 = ←−","h T +1 = 0.

We omit subscripts when there is no ambiguity."]},{"title":"722","paragraphs":["the future. (See Figure 1, top right.) Therefore in the bidirectional case, we have perfect information about the sequence (ignoring the practical difficulties about capturing long term dependencies, caused by vanishing gradients), whereas the classical Elman-type network uses only partial information as described above.","Note that the forward and backward parts of the network are independent of each other until the output layer when they are combined. This means that during training, after backpropagating the error terms from the output layer to the forward and backward hidden layers, the two parts can be thought of as separate, and each trained with the classical backpropagation through time (Werbos, 1990). 3.3 Depth in Space Recurrent neural networks are often characterized as having depth in time: when unfolded, they are equivalent to feedforward neural networks with as many hidden layers as the number tokens in the input sequence (with shared connections across multiple layers of time). However, this notion of depth likely does not involve hierarchical processing of the data: across different time steps, we repeatedly apply the same transformation to compute the memory contribution of the input (W ), to compute the response value from the current memory (U ) and to compute the next memory vector from the previous one (V ). Therefore, assuming the input vectors {xt} together lie in the same representation space, as do the output vectors {yt}, hidden representations {ht} lie in the same space as well. As a result, they do not necessarily become more and more abstract, hierarchical representations of one another as we traverse in time. However in the more conventional, stacked deep learners (e.g. deep feedforward nets), an important benefit of depth is the hierarchy among hidden representations: every hidden layer conceptually lies in a different representation space, and constitutes a more abstract and higher-level representation of the input (Bengio, 2009).","In order to address these concerns, we investigate deep RNNs, which are constructed by stacking Elman-type RNNs on top of each other (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013). Intuitively, every layer of the deep RNN treats the memory sequence of the previous layer as the input sequence, and computes its own memory representation.","More formally, we have:","−→","h (i)","t = f (−→","W (i)","→ −→","h (i−1)","t + −→","W (i)","← ←−","h (i−1)","t","+ −→","V (i)−→ h (i) t−1 + −→","b (i)",") (6)","←−","h (i)","t = f (←−","W (i)","→ −→ h (i−1) t + ←−","W (i)","← ←−","h (i−1)","t","+ ←−","V (i)←− h (i) t+1 + ←−","b (i)",") (7)","when i > 1 and","−→","h (1)","t = f (−→","W (1) xt + −→","V (1)−→","h (1)","t−1 + −→","b (1)",") (8)","←−","h (1)","t = f (←−","W (1)","xt + ←−","V (1)←−","h (1)","t+1 + ←−","b (1)",") (9) Importantly, note that both forward and backward representations are employed when computing the forward and backward memory of the next layer.","Two alternatives for the output layer computations are to employ all memory layers or only the last. In this work we adopt the second approach:","yt = g(U→−→ h (L) t + U←←−","h (L)","t + c) (10) where L is the number of layers. Intuitively, connecting the output layer to only the last hidden layer forces the architecture to capture enough high-level information at the final layer for producing the appropriate output-layer decision.","Training a deep RNN can be conceptualized as in-terleaved applications of the conventional backpropagation across multiple layers, and backpropagation through time within a single layer.","The unidirectional and bidirectional deep RNNs are depicted in the bottom half of Figure 1. Hypotheses. In general, we expected that the deep RNNs would show the most improvement over shallow RNNS for ESEs — phrases that implicitly convey subjectivity. Existing research has shown that these are harder to identify than direct expressions of subjectivity (DSEs): they are variable in length and involve terms that, in many (or most) contexts, are neutral with respect to sentiment and subjectivity. As a result, models that do a better job interpreting the context should be better at disambiguating subjective vs. non-subjective uses of phrases involving common words (e.g. “as usual”, “in fact”). Whether or not deep RNNs would be powerful enough to outperform the state-of-the-art semiCRF was unclear, especially if the semiCRF is given access to the distributed word representations (embeddings) employed by the deep RNNs. In addition, the semiCRF has access to parse tree information and opinion lexicons, neither of which is available to the deep RNNs."]},{"title":"4 ExperimentsActivation Units.","paragraphs":["We employ the standard softmax activation for the output layer: g(x) = exi","/ ∑","j exj",".

We use precision, recall and Fmeasure for performance evaluation. Since the boundaries of expressions are hard to define even for human annotators (Wiebe et al., 2005), we use two soft notions of the measures: Binary Overlap counts every overlapping match between a predicted and true expression as correct (Breck et al., 2007; Yang and Cardie, 2012), and Proportional Overlap imparts a partial correctness, proportional to the overlapping amount, to each match (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2012). All statistical comparisons are done using a two-sided paired t-test with a confidence level of α = .05. Baselines (CRF and SEMICRF). As baselines, we use the CRF-based method of Breck et al. (2007) and the SEMICRF-based method of Yang and Cardie (2012), which is the state-of-the-art in opinion expression extraction. Features that the baselines use are words, part-of-speech tags and membership in a manually constructed opinion lexicon (within a [-1, +1] context window). Since SEMICRF relaxes the Markovian assumption and operates at the segment-level instead of the token-level, it also has access to parse trees of sentences to generate candidate segments (Yang and Cardie, 2012). Word Vectors (+VEC). We also include versions of the baselines that have access to pre-trained word vectors. In particular, CRF+VEC employs word vectors as continuous features per every token. Since SEMICRF has phrase-level rather than word-level features, we simply take the mean of every word vector for a phrase-level vector representation for SEMICRF+VEC as suggested in Mikolov et al. (2013).","In all of our experiments, we keep the word vectors fixed (i.e. do not finetune) to reduce the degree of freedom of our models. We use the publicly available 300-dimensional word vectors of Mikolov et al. (2013), trained on part of the Google News dataset (∼100B words). Preliminary experiments with other word vector representations such as Collobert-Weston (2008) embeddings or HLBL (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) provided poorer results (∼ −3% difference in proportional and binary F1). Regularizer. We do not employ any regularization for smaller networks (∼24,000 parameters) because we have not observed strong overfitting (i.e. the difference between training and test performance is small). Larger networks are regularized with the recently proposed dropout technique (Hinton et al., 2012): we randomly set entries of hidden representations to 0 with a probability called the dropout rate, which is tuned over the development set.

Network Training. We use the standard multiclass cross-entropy as the objective function when training the neural networks. We use stochastic gradient descent with momentum with a fixed learning rate (.005) and a fixed momentum rate (.7). We update weights after minibatches of 80 sentences. We run 200 epochs for training. Weights are initialized from small random uniform noise. We experiment with networks of various sizes, however we have the same number of hidden units across multiple forward and backward hidden layers of a single RNN. We do not employ a pre-training step; deep architectures are trained with the supervised error signal, even though the output layer is connected to only the final hidden layer. With these configurations, every architecture successfully converges without any oscillatory behavior. Additionally, we employ early stopping for the neural networks: out of all iterations, the model with the best development set performance (Proportional F1) is selected as the final model to be evaluated. 4.1 Results and Discussion Bidirectional vs. Unidirectional. Although our focus is on bidirectional RNNs, we first confirm that the SHALLOW bidirectional RNN outperforms a (shallow) unidirectional RNN for both DSE and ESE recogni-tion. To make the comparison fair, each network has the same number of total parameters: we use 65 hidden units for the unidirectional, and 36 for the bidirectional network, respectively. Results are as expected: the bidirectional RNN obtains higher F1 scores than the unidirectional RNN — 63.83 vs. 60.35 (proportional overlap) and 69.62 vs. 68.31 (binary overlap) for DSEs; 54.22 vs. 51.51 (proportional) and 65.44 vs. 63.65 (binary) for ESEs. All differences are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Thus, we will not include comparisons to the unidirectional RNNs in the remaining experiments. Adding Depth. Next, we quantitatively investigate the effects of adding depth to RNNs. Tables 2 and 3 show the evaluation of RNNs of various depths and sizes. In both tables, the first group networks have approximately 24,000 parameters and the second group networks have approximately 200,000 parameters. Since all RNNs within a group have approximately the same number of parameters, they grow narrower as they get deeper. Within each group, bold shows the best result with an asterisk denoting statistically indistinguishable performance with respect to the best. As noted above, all statistical comparisons use a two-sided paired t-test with a confidence level of α = .05.","In both DSE and ESE detection and for larger networks (bottom set of results), 3-layer RNNs provide the best results. For smaller networks (top set of results), 2, 3 and 4-layer RNNs show equally good performance for certain sizes and metrics and, in general, adding additional layers degrades performance. This could be related to how we train the architectures as well as to the decrease in width of the networks. In general, we observe a trend of increasing performance as we increase the number of layers, until a certain depth. deepRNNs vs. (semi)CRF. Table 4 shows comparison of the best deep RNNs to the previous best results in the literature. In terms of F-measure, DEEP RNN performs best for both DSE and ESE detection, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for the more strict proportional overlap measure, which is harder to improve upon than the binary evaluation metric. SEMICRF, with its very high recall, performs comparably to the DEEP RNN on the binary metric. Note that RNNs do not have access to any features other than word vectors.","In general, CRFs exhibit high precision but low recall (CRFs have the best precision on both DSE and ESE detection) while SEMICRFs exhibit a high recall, low precision performance. Compared to SEMICRF, the DEEP RNNs produce an even higher recall but sometimes lower precision for ESE detection.

This sometimes hurts overall F-measure.","Among the (SEMI)CRF-based methods, SEMICRF obtains the highest F1 score for DSEs and for ESEs using the softer metric; SEMICRF+VEC performs best for ESEs according to the stricter proportional overlap measure. Network size. Finally, we observe that even small networks (such as 4-layer deep RNN for DSE and 2-layer deep RNN for ESE) outperform conventional CRFs. This suggests that with the help of good word vectors, we can train compact but powerful sequential neural models.","When examining the output, we see some systematic differences between the previously top-performing SEMICRF and the RNN-based models. (See Figure 2.) First, SEMICRF often identifies excessively long subjective phrases as in Example 1. Here, none of the models exactly matches the gold standard, but the RNNs are much closer. And all three models appear to have identified an ESE that was mistakenly omitted by the human annotator — “obviously”. At the same time, the SEMICRF sometimes entirely misses subjective expressions that the RNNs identify — this seems to occur when there are no clear indications of sentiment in the subjective expression. The latter can be seen in Examples 2 and 3, in which the SEMICRF does not identify “but equally”, “would have to be based on evidence”, “not yet”, and “not enough”.","We also observe evidence of the power of the DEEPRNN over the SHALLOWRNN in Examples 4 and 5. (See Figure 3.) In contrast to Figure 2, Figure 3 distinguishes subjective expressions that are (correctly) assigned an initial Begin label from those that consist only of Inside labels2","— the latter are shown in ALL CAPS and indicate some degree of confusion in the model that produced them. In Example 4, SHALLOWRNN exhibits some evidence for each ESE — it labels one or more tokens as Inside an ESE (“any” and “time”). But it does not explicitly tag the beginning of the ESE. DEEPRNN does better, identifying the first ESE in its entirety (“in any case”) and identifying more words as being Inside the second ESE (“it is high time). A similar situation occurs in Example 5."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have explored an application of deep recurrent neural networks to the task of sentence-level opinion expression extraction.

Furthermore, deep RNNs outperformed previous (semi)CRF baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results for fine-grained on opinion expression extraction.","We have trained our deep networks without any pre-training and with only the last hidden layer connected to the output layer. One potential future direction is to explore the effects of pre-training on the architecture. Pre-training might help to exploit the additional representational power available in deeper networks. Another direction is to investigate the impact of finetuning the word vectors during supervised training. Additionally, alternative notions of depth that are orthogonal to stacking, as in Pascanu et al. (2013) can be investigated for this task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by NSF grant IIS-1314778 and DARPA DEFT Grant FA8750-13-2-0015.
