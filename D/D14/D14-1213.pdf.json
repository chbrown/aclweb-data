Although there are many social science studies of self-disclosure, they are based on manual coding of small datasets and questionnaires. We conduct a computational analysis of self-disclosure with a large dataset of naturally-occurring conversations, a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, and a computational analysis of the effects of self-disclosure on subsequent conversations. We use a longitudinal dataset of 17 million tweets, all of which occurred in conversations that consist of five or more tweets directly reply-ing to the previous tweet, and from dyads with twenty of more conversations each. We develop self-disclosure topic model (SDTM), a variant of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for automatically classifying the level of self-disclosure for each tweet. We take the results of SDTM and analyze the effects of self-disclosure on subsequent conversations. Our model significantly outperforms several comparable methods on classifying the level of self-disclosure, and the analysis of the longitudinal data using SDTM uncovers significant and positive correlation between self-disclosure and conversation frequency and length."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Self-disclosure is an important and pervasive social behavior. People disclose personal information about themselves to improve and maintain","∗","This work was done when JinYeong Bak was a visiting student at Microsoft Research, Beijing, China. relationships (Jourard, 1971; Joinson and Paine, 2007). A common instance of self-disclosure is the start of a conversation with an exchange of names and additional self-introductions. Another example of self-disclosure, shown in Figure 1c, where the information disclosed about a family member’s serious illness, is much more personal than the exchange of names. In this paper, we seek to understand this important social behavior using a large-scale Twitter conversation data, automatically classifying the level of self-disclosure using machine learning and correlating the patterns with conversational behaviors which can serve as proxies for measuring intimacy between two conversational partners.","Twitter conversation data, explained in more detail in section 4.1, enable an extremely large scale study of naturally-occurring self-disclosure behavior, compared to traditional social science studies. One challenge of such large scale study, though, remains in the lack of labeled ground-truth data of self-disclosure level. That is, naturally-occurring Twitter conversations do not come tagged with the level of self-disclosure in each conversation. To overcome that challenge, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach using probabilistic topic modeling. Our self-disclosure topic model (SDTM) assumes that self-disclosure behavior can be modeled using a combination of simple linguistic features (e.g., pronouns) with automatically discovered semantic themes (i.e., topics). For instance, an utterance “I am finally through with this disastrous relationship” uses a first-person pronoun and contains a topic about personal relationships.","In comparison with various other models, SDTM shows the highest accuracy, and the result-ing conversation frequency and length patterns on self-disclosure are shown different over time. Our contributions to the research community include the following: 1986","• We present key features and prior knowledge for identifying self-disclosure level, and show relevance of it with experiment results (Sec. 2).","• We present a topic model that explicitly includes the level of self-disclosure in a conversation using linguistic features and the latent semantic topics (Sec. 3).","• We collect a large dataset of Twitter conversations over three years and annotate a small subset with self-disclosure level (Sec. 4).","• We compare the classification accuracy of SDTM with other models and show that it performs the best (Sec. 5).","• We correlate the self-disclosure patterns and conversation behaviors to show that there is significant relationship over time (Sec. 6)."]},{"title":"2 Self-Disclosure","paragraphs":["In this section, we look at social science literature for definition of the levels of self-disclosure. Us-ing that definition, we devise an approach to automatically identify the levels of self-disclosure in a large corpus of OSN conversations. We discuss three approaches, first, using first-person pronoun features, and second, extracting seed words and phrases from the Twitter conversation corpus, and third, extracting seed words and phrases from an external corpus of anonymously posted secrets, and we demonstrate the efficacy of those approaches with an annotated corpus. 2.1 Self-disclosure (SD) level To analyze self-disclosure, researchers categorize self-disclosure language into three levels: G (general) for no disclosure, M for medium disclosure, and H for high disclosure (Vondracek and Vondracek, 1971; Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007). Utterances that contain general (non-sensitive) information about the self or someone close (e.g., a family member) are categorized as M. Examples are personal events, past history, or future plans. Utterances about age, occupation and hobbies are also included. Utterances that contain sensitive information about the self or someone close are categorized as H. Sensitive information includes personal characteristics, problematic behaviors, physical appearance and wishful ideas. Generally, these are thoughts and information that (a) A G level Twitter conversation (b) A M level Twitter conversation (c) A H level Twitter conversation Figure 1: An example of a Twitter conversation (from annotated dataset) with G, M and H level of self-disclosure. one would keep as secrets to himself. All other utterances, those that do not contain information about the self or someone close are categorized as G. Examples include gossip about celebrities or factual discourse about current events. Figure 1 shows Twitter conversation examples with G, M and H levels from annotated dataset (see Section 4.2 for a detailed description of the annotated dataset). 2.2 G Level of Self-Disclosure An obvious clue of self-disclosure is the use of first-person pronouns. For example, phrases such as ‘I live’ or ‘My name is’ indicate that the utterance contains personal information. In previous research, the simple method of counting first-person pronouns was used to measure the degree of self-disclosure (Joinson, 2001; Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007). Consequently, the absence of a first-person pronoun signals that the utterance be-longs in the G level of self-disclosure. We verify this pattern with a dataset of Tweets annotated with G, M, and H levels. We divide the annotated Tweets into two classes, G and M/H. Then we compute mutual information of each unigram, bigram, or trigram feature to see which features are most discriminative. As Table 1 shows, 18 out of 30 1987 Category Words/Expressions Unigram my, I, I’m, I’ll, but, was, I’ve, love, dad, have Bigram I love, I was, I have, my dad, go to, my mom, with my, have to, to go, my mum Trigram I have a, is going to, to go to, want to go, and I was, going to miss, I love him, I think I, I was like, I wish I Table 1: High ranked words and expressions by mutual information between G and M/H level in annotated conversations. most highly ranked discriminative features contain a first-person pronoun. 2.3 M Level of Self-Disclosure Utterances with M level include two types: 1) information related with past events and future plans, and 2) general information about self (Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007). For the former, we add as seed trigrams ‘I have been’ and ‘I will’. For the latter, we use seven types of information generally accepted to be personally identifiable information (McCallister, 2010), as listed in the left column of Table 2. To find the appropriate trigrams for those, we take Twitter conversation data (described in Section 4.1) and look for trigrams that begin with ‘I’ and ‘my’ and occur more than 200 times. We then check each one to see whether it is related with any of the seven types listed in the table. As a result, we find 57 seed trigrams for M level. Table 2 shows several examples. Type Trigram Name My name is, My last name Birthday My birthday is, My birthday party Location I live in, I lived in, I live on Contact My email address, My phone number Occupation My job is, My new job Education My high school, My college is Family My dad is, My mom is, My family is Table 2: Example seed trigrams for identifying M level of SD. There are 51 of these used in SDTM. 2.4 H Level of Self-Disclosure Utterances with H level express secretive wishes or sensitive information that exposes self or someone close (Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007). These are generally kept as secrets. With this intuition, we crawled 26,523 posts from Six Billion Secrets1 site where users post secrets anonymously2",". We 1 http://www.sixbillionsecrets.com 2 This site is regularly monitored for spam.

Categories are hand-labeled. call this external dataset SECRET. Unlike G and M levels, evidence of H level of self-disclosure tends to be topical, such as physical appearance, mental and physical illnesses, and family problems, so we take an approach of fitting a topic model driven by seed words. A similar approach has been successful in sentiment classification (Jo and Oh, 2011; Kim et al., 2013).","A critical component of this approach is the set of seed words with which to drive the discovery of topics that are most indicative of H level self-disclosure. To extract the seed words that express secretive personal information, we compute mutual information (Manning et al., 2008) with SECRET and 24,610 randomly selected tweets. We select 1,000 words with high mutual information and filter out stop words. Table 3 shows some of these words. To extract seed trigrams of secretive wishes, we again look for trigrams that start with ‘I’ or ‘my’, occur more than 200 times, and select trigrams of wishful thinking, such as ‘I want to’, and ‘I wish I’. In total, there are 88 seed words and 8 seed trigrams for H.","Since SECRET is quite different from Twitter, we must show that posts in SECRET are semantically similar to the H level Tweets. Rather than directly comparing SECRET posts and Tweets, we use the same method of extracting discriminative word features from the annotated H level Tweets (see Section 4.2). Table 3 shows the seed words extracted from SECRET as well as the annotated Tweets. Because the annotated dataset consists of only 200 conversations, the coverage of the topics seems narrower than the much larger SECRETS, but both datasets show similarities in the topics. This, combined with the results of the model with the two sets of seed words (see Section 5 for the results), shows that SECRETS is an effective and simple-to-obtain substitute for an annotated corpus of H level of self-disclosure. 1988 � � π r � � CT N � ω λ �","θl 3 �l","φl Kl","3 Figure 2: Graphical model of SDTM Notation Description G; M; H {general; medium; high} SD level C; T ; N Number of conversations; tweets; words","KG ; KM","; KH Number of topics for {G; M; H} c; ct Conversation; tweet in conversation c yct SD level of tweet ct, G or M/H rct SD level of tweet ct, M or H zct Topic of tweet ct wctn","nth word in tweet ct λ Learned Maximum entropy parameters xct First-person pronouns features ωct Distribution over SD level of tweet ct πc SD level proportion of conversation c","θG c ; θM c ; θH","c Topic proportion of {G; M; H} in conversation c","φG ; φM","; φH Word distribution of {G; M; H} α; γ Dirichlet prior for θ; π","βG , βM","; βH","Dirichlet prior for φG ; φM","; φH ncl Number of tweets assigned SD level l in conversation c nl ck Number of tweets assigned SD level l and topic k in conversation c nl kv Number of instances of word v assigned SD level l and topic k mctkv Number of instances of word v assigned topic k in tweet ct Table 4: Summary of notations used in SDTM"]},{"title":"3 Self-Disclosure Topic Model","paragraphs":["This section describes our model, the self-disclosure topic model (SDTM), for classifying self-disclosure level and discovering topics for each self-disclosure level. 3.1 Model In section 2, we discussed different approaches to identifying each level of self-disclosure, based on social science literature, annotated and unannotated Tweets, and an external corpus of secret posts.

Table 4 lists the notations used in the model and the generative process, and Figure 3 describes the generative process. 3.2 Classifying G vs M/H levels Classifying the SD level for each tweet is done in two parts, and the first part classifies G vs. M/H levels with first-person pronouns (I, my, me). In the graphical model, y is the latent variable that represents this classification, and ω is the distribution over y. x is the observation of the first-person pronoun in the tweets, and λ are the parameters learned from the maximum entropy classifier. With the annotated Twitter conversation dataset (described in Section 4.2), we experimented with several classifiers (Decision tree, Naive Bayes) and chose the maximum entropy classifier because it performed the best, similar to other joint topic models (Zhao et al., 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2013). 1989 3.3 Classifying M vs H levels The second part of the classification, the M and the H level, is driven by informative priors with seed words and seed trigrams. In the graphical model, r is the latent variable that represents this classification, and π is the distribution over r. γ is a non-informative prior for π, and βl","is an informative prior for each SD level by seed words. For example, we assign a high value for the seed word ‘acne’ for βH",", and a low value for ‘My name is’. This approach is the same as joint models of topic and sentiment (Jo and Oh, 2011; Kim et al., 2013). 3.4 Inference For posterior inference of SDTM, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling which integrates out latent random variables ω, π, θ, and φ.

We also make sure that each conversation is at least five tweets, and that each dyad has at least twenty conversations. 4.1 Collecting Twitter conversations We define a Twitter conversation as a chain of tweets where two users are consecutively reply-ing to each other’s tweets using the Twitter reply button. We initialize the set of users by randomly sampling thirteen users who reply to other users in English from the Twitter public streams3",". Then we crawl each user’s public tweets, and look at users who are mentioned in those tweets. It is a breadth-first search in the network defined by users as nodes and edges as conversations. We run this search for dyads until the depth of four, and filter out users who tweet in a non-English language. We use an open source tool for detecting English tweets4",".

When the proportions of tweets at M or H level are both less than 0.2, we assign G to the SD level. The reason for setting 0.2 as the threshold is that a conversation containing tweets with H or M level of self-disclosure usually starts with a greeting or a general comment, and contains one or more questions or comments before or after the self-disclosure tweet.","We compare SDTM with the following methods for classifying conversations for SD level:","• LDA (Blei et al., 2003): A Bayesian topic model.

Conversation length is measured by the number of tweets in a conversation.","The result of regression is that the independent variable’s coefficient is 0.048 with a low p-value (p < 0.0001). Figure 6 shows the scatter plot with the regression line, and we can see that the slope of regression line is positive. 1993 G level M level H level 101 184 176 36 104 82 113 33 19 chocolate obama league send twitter going ass better lips butter he’s win email follow party bitch sick kisses good romney game i’ll tumblr weekend fuck feel love cake vote season sent tweet day yo throat smiles peanut right team dm following night shit cold softly milk president cup address account dinner fucking hope hand sugar people city know fb birthday lmao pain eyes cream good arsenal check followers tomorrow shut good neck make going chelsea link facebook come dick cough arms love time liverpool need followed i’ll kick bad head yum party won message omg family face i’ve smirks hot election football let right fun hoe need slowly cookies gop united sure saw friends lmfao sore hair banana paul final thanks page tonight nigga flu face bread way away my email timeline plans bi today chest Table 7: High ranked topics in each level by comparing KL-divergence with other level’s topics 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Initial SD level 0.10 0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 # Tweets in conversation changes proportion over time Figure 6: Relationship between initial SD level and conversation length changes over time.

Now we investigate the conversation length changes over time with three groups, low, medium, and high, by overall SD level. Then we investigate changes in conversation length over time.","Figure 7 shows the results of this investigation. First, conversations are generally lengthier when SD level is high.

Second, conversation length increases consistently and significantly for the high and medium groups, but for the low SD group, there is not a significant increase of conversation length over time."]},{"title":"7 Related Work","paragraphs":["Prior work on quantitatively analyzing self-disclosure has relied on user surveys (Ledbetter et 1994 al., 2011; Trepte and Reinecke, 2013) or human annotation (Barak and Gluck-Ofri, 2007; Courtney Walton and Rice, 2013). These methods consume much time and effort, so they are not suitable for large-scale studies. In prior work closest to ours, Bak et al. (2012) showed that a topic model can be used to identify self-disclosure, but that work applies a two-step process in which a basic topic model is first applied to find the topics, and then the topics are post-processed for binary classification of self-disclosure. We improve upon this work by applying a single unified model of topics and self-disclosure for high accuracy in classifying the three levels of self-disclosure.","Subjectivity which is aspect of expressing opinions (Pang and Lee, 2008; Wiebe et al., 2004) is related with self-disclosure, but they are different dimensions of linguistic behavior. Because there indeed are many high self-disclosure tweets that are subjective, but there are also counter examples in annotated dataset. The tweet “England manager is Roy Hodgson.” is low self-disclosure and low subjectivity, “I have barely any hair left.” is high self-disclosure but low subjectivity, and “Senator stop lying!” is low self-disclosure but high subjectivity."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented the self-disclosure topic model (SDTM) for discovering topics and classifying SD levels from Twitter conversation data. We devised a set of effective seed words and trigrams, mined from a dataset of secrets. We also annotated Twitter conversations to make a ground-truth dataset for SD level. With annotated data, we showed that SDTM outperforms previous methods in classification accuracy and F-measure. We publish the source code of SDTM and the dataset include annotated Twitter conversations and SECRET publicly7",".","We also analyzed the relationship between SD level and conversation behaviors over time. We found that there is a positive correlation between initial SD level and subsequent conversation length. Also, dyads show higher level of SD if they initially display high conversation frequency. Finally, dyads with overall medium and high SD level will have longer conversations over time. These results support previous results in so-7 http://uilab.kaist.ac.kr/research/","EMNLP2014 cial psychology research with more robust results from a large-scale dataset, and show the effectiveness of computationally analyzing at SD behavior.","There are several future directions for this research. First, we can improve our modeling for higher accuracy and better interpretability. For instance, SDTM only considers first-person pronouns and topics. Naturally, there are other linguistic patterns that can be identified by humans but not captured by pronouns and topics. Second, the number of topics for each level is varied, and so we can explore nonparametric topic models (Teh et al., 2006) which infer the number of topics from the data. Third, we can look at the relationship between self-disclosure behavior and general online social network usage beyond conversations. We will explore these directions in our future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Jing Liu and Wayne Xin Zhao for inspiring discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.
