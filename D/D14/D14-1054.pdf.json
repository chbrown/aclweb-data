Under this perspective, previous studies typically use pipelined methods with two steps. They first produce sentence segmentations with separate text analyzers (Choi and Cardie, 2008; Nakagawa et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013b) or bag-of-words (Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010; Maas et al., 2011). Then, feature learning and sentiment classification algorithms take the segmentation results as inputs to build the sentiment classifier (Socher et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2014).","The major disadvantage of a pipelined method is the problem of error propagation, since sentence segmentation errors cannot be corrected by the sentiment classification model. A typical kind of error is caused by the polarity inconsistency between a phrase and the words it contains, such as ⟨not bad, bad⟩ and ⟨a great deal of, great⟩. The segmentations based on bag-of-words or syntactic chunkers are not effective enough to handle the polarity inconsistency phenomenons. The reason lies in that bag-of-words segmentations regard each word as a separate unit, which losses the word order and does not capture the phrasal information. The segmentations based on syntactic chunkers typically aim to identify noun groups, verb groups or named entities from a sentence. However, many sentiment indicators are phrases constituted of adjectives, negations, adverbs or idioms (Liu, 2012; Mohammad et al., 2013a), which are splitted by syntactic chunkers. Besides, a better approach would be to utilize the sentiment information to improve the segmentor. Accordingly, the sentiment-specific segmentor will enhance the performance of sentiment classification in turn.","In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC) for sentiment analysis, which simultaneous conducts sentence segmentation and sentence-level sentiment classification.

Lexicon-based approaches (Turney, 2002; Ding et al., 2008; Taboada et al., 2011; Thelwall et al., 2012) typically utilize a lexicon of sentiment words, each of which is annotated with the sentiment polarity or sentiment strength. Linguistic rules such as intensifications and negations are usually incorporated to aggregate the sentiment polarity of sentences (or documents). Corpus-based methods treat sentiment classification as a special case of text categorization task (Pang et al., 2002). They mostly build the sentiment classifier from sentences (or documents) with manually annotated sentiment polarity or distantly-supervised corpora collected by sentiment signals like emoticons (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012).","Majority of existing approaches follow Pang et al. (2002) and employ corpus-based method for sentiment classification. Pang et al. (2002) pioneer to treat the sentiment classification of reviews as a special case of text categorization problem and first investigate machine learning methods. They employ Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a diverse set of features. In their experiments, the best performance is achieved by SVM with bag-of-words feature. Under this perspective, many studies focus on designing or learning effective features to obtain better classification performance. On movie or product reviews, Wang and Manning (2012) present NBSVM, which trades-off 478 between Naive Bayes and NB-feature enhanced SVM. Kim and Zhai (2009) and Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) learn the feature weights by in-vestigating variants weighting functions from Information Retrieval. Nakagawa et al. (2010) utilize dependency trees, polarity-shifting rules and conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) with hidden variables to compute the document feature. On Twitter, Mohammad et al. (2013b) develop a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment classifier in SemEval 2013, using a variety of sentiment lexicons and hand-crafted features.","With the revival of deep learning (representation learning (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006; Bengio et al., 2013; Jones, 2014)), more recen-t studies focus on learning the low-dimensional, dense and real-valued vector as text features for sentiment classification. Glorot et al. (2011) investigate Stacked Denoising Autoencoders to learn document vector for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. Yessenalina and Cardie (2011) represent each word as a matrix and compose words using iterated matrix multipli-cation. Socher et al. propose Recursive Autoencoder (RAE) (2011), Matrix-Vector Recursive Neural Network (MV-RNN) (2012) and Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) (2013b) to learn the composition of variable-length phrases based on the representation of its children.

Then, we present the overview of the proposed joint segmentation and classification model (JSC) for sentiment analysis. The segmentation candidate generation model and the segmentation ranking model are described in Section 4. The details of the sentiment classification model are presented in Section 5. 3.1 Task Definition The task of sentiment classification has been well formalized in previous studies (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012). The objective is to identify the sentiment polarity of a sentence (or document) as positive or negative 1",".","The task of sentence segmentation aims to split a sentence into a sequence of exclusive part-s, each of which is a basic computational unit of the sentence. An example is illustrated in Table 1. The original text “ that is not bad” is segmented as “ [that] [is] [not bad]”. The segmentation result is composed of three basic computational units, namely [that], [is] and [not bad]. Type Sample Sentence that is not bad Segmentation [that] [is] [not bad] Basic units [that], [is], [not bad] Table 1: Example for sentence segmentation. 3.2 Joint Model (JSC) The overview of the proposed joint segmentation and classification model (JSC) for sentiment analysis is illustrated in Figure 1. The intuitions of the joint model are two-folds:","• The segmentation results have a strong influence on the sentiment classification performance, since they are the inputs of the sentiment classification model.","• The usefulness of a segmentation can be judged by whether the sentiment classifier can use it to predict the correct sentence polarity.","Based on the mutual influence observation, we formalize the joint model in Algorithm 1. The inputs contain two parts, training data and feature extractors. Each sentence si in the training data 1","In this paper, the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not relevant to the target (or aspect) it contains (Hu and Liu, 2004; Jiang et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2013). 479","Algorithm 1 The joint segmentation and classifi-","cation framework (JSC) for sentiment analysis","Input: training data: T = [si, polg","i ], 1 ≤ i ≤ |T | segmentation feature extractor: sf e(·) classification feature extractor: cf e(·)","Output: sentiment classifier: SC segmentation ranking model: SEG","1: Generate segmentation candidates Ωi for each sentence si in T , 1 ≤ i ≤ |T |","2: Initialize sentiment classifier SC(0)","based on cf e(Ωij), randomize j ∈ [1, |Ωi|], 1 ≤ i ≤ |T |","3: Randomly initialize the segmentation ranking model SEG(0)","4: for r ← 1 ...

Since the segmentation results have an exponential search space in the number of words in a sentence, we approximate the computation using beam search with constrains on a phrase table, which is induced from massive corpora.","Many studies have been previously proposed to recognize phrases in the text. However, it is out of scope of this work to compare them. We exploit a data-driven approach given by Mikolov et al. (2013), which identifies phrases based on the occurrence frequency of unigrams and bigrams, f req(wi, wj) =","f req(wi, wj) − δ f req(wi) × f req(wj) (1) 480 where δ is a discounting coefficient that prevents too many phrases consisting of very infrequen-t words. We run 2-4 times over the corpora to get longer phrases containing more words. We empirically set δ as 10 in our experiment. We use the default frequency threshold (value=5) in the word2vec toolkit 2","to select bi-terms.","Given a sentence, we initialize the beam of each index with the current word, and sequentially add phrases into the beam if the new phrase is contained in the phrase table. At each index of a sentence, we rank the segmentation candidates by the inverted number of items within a segmentation, and save the top-ranked N segmentation candidates into the beam. An example of the generated segmentation candidates is given in Table 2. Type Sample Sentence that is not bad Phrase Table [is not], [not bad], [is not bad] Segmentations [that] [is not bad] [that] [is not] [bad] [that] [is] [not bad] [that] [is] [not] [bad] Table 2: Example for segmentation candidate generation. 4.2 Segmentation Ranking Model The objective of the segmentation ranking model is to assign a scalar to each segmentation candidate, which indicates the usefulness of the segmentation result for sentiment classification. In this subsection, we describe a log-linear model to calculate the segmentation score. To effectively train the segmentation ranking model, we devise a marginal log-likelihood as the optimization objective.","Given a segmentation candidate Ωij of the sentence si, we calculate the segmentation score for Ωij with a log-linear model, as given in Equation 2.","φij = exp(b + ∑ k sf eijk · wk) (2) where φij is the segmentation score of Ωij; sf eijk is the k-th segmentation feature of Ωij; w and b are the parameters of the segmentation ranking model.

We train the segmentation model with L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), running over the complete training data. 4.3 Feature We design two kinds of features for sentence segmentation, namely the phrase-embedding feature and the segmentation-specific feature. The final feature representation of each segmentation is the concatenation of these two features. It is worth noting that, the phrase-embedding feature is used in both sentence segmentation and sentiment classification. Segmentation-Specific Feature We empirically design four segmentation-specific features to reflect the information of each segmentation, as list-ed in Table 3. Phrase-Embedding Feature We leverage phrase embedding to generate the features of segmentation candidates for both sentence segmentation and sentiment classification. The reason is that, in both tasks, the basic computational units of each segmentation candidate might be words or phrases of variable length. Under this scenario, phrase embedding is highly suitable as it is capable to represent phrases with different length into a consistent distributed vector space (Mikolov et al., 2013). For each phrase, phrase embedding is a dense, real-valued and continuous vector. After the phrase embedding is trained, the nearest neighbors in the embedding space are favored to have similar grammatical usages and semantic meanings. The effectiveness of phrase embedding has been verified for building large-scale sentiment lexicon (Tang et al., 2014a) and machine translation (Zhang et al., 2014).","We learn phrase embedding with Skip-Gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013), which is the state-of-481 Feature Feature Description #unit the number of basic computation units in the segmentation candidate #unit / #word the ratio of units’ number in a candidate to the length of original sentence #word − #unit the difference between sentence length and the number of basic computational units #unit > 2 the number of basic component units composed of more than two words Table 3: Segmentation-specific features for segmentation ranking.

We compose the representation (or feature) of a segmentation candidate from the embedding of the basic computational units (words or phrases) it contains. In this paper, we explore min, max and average convolution functions, which have been used as simple and effective methods for composition learning in vector-based semantics (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013a; Shen et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014b), to calculate the representation of a segmentation candidate.

We describe the experiment settings and the result analysis. 6.1 Dataset and Experiment Settings We conduct sentiment classification of tweets on a benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013. We run 2-class (positive vs negative) classification as sentence segmentation has a great influence on the positive/negative polarity of tweets due to the polarity inconsistency between a phrase and its constitutes, such as ⟨not bad, bad⟩. 482 We leave 3-class classification (positive, negative, neutral) and fine-grained classification (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) in the future work.

We re-implement this system because the codes are not publicly available. We do not directly report their results in the evaluation task, as our training and development sets are smaller than their dataset. In NRC + PF, We concatenate the NRC features and the phrase embeddings feature (PF), and build the sentiment classifier with LibLinear.","Except for DistSuper, other baseline methods are conducted in a supervised manner. We do not compare with RNTN (Socher et al., 2013b) because the tweets in our dataset do not have accurately parsed results. Another reason is that, due to the differences between domains, the performance of RNTN trained on movie reviews might be decreased if directly applied on the tweets (Xiao et al., 2013). 6.3 Results and Analysis Table 6 shows the macro-F1 of the baseline systems as well as our joint model (JSC) on sentiment classification of tweets (positivevs negative).","As is shown in Table 6, distant supervision is relatively weak because the noisy-labeled tweets are treated as the gold standard, which decreases the performance of sentiment classifier.

The integra-tion of high-order n-ngram (up to 5-gram) does not achieve significant improvement (+0.47%). The reason is that, if a sentence contains a bigram “ not bad”, they will use “ bad” and “ not bad” as parallel features, which confuses the sentiment classification model. NBSVM and Recursive Autoencoder perform comparatively and have a big gap in comparison with JSC. In RAE, the representation of a sentence is composed from the representation of words it contains. Accordingly, “ great” in “ a great deal of ” also contributes to the final sentence representation via composition function. JSC automatically conducts sentence segmentation by considering the sentiment polarity of sentence, and utilize the phrasal information from the segmentations. Ideally, JSC regards phrases like “ not bad” and “ a great deal of ” as basic computational units, and yields better classification performance. JSC (85.51%) performs slightly better than the state-of-the-art systems (SSWEu, 84.98%; NRC+PF, 84.75%), which verifies its effectiveness. 6.4 Comparing Joint and Pipelined Models We compare the proposed joint model with pipelined methods on Twitter sentiment classification with different feature sets. Figure 2 gives the experiment results. The tick [A, B] on x-axis means the use of A as segmentation feature and the use of B as classification feature. PF represents the phrase-embedding feature; SF and CF stand for the segmentation-specific feature and classification-specific feature, respectively. We use the bag-of-word segmentation result to build sentiment classier in Pipeline 1, and use the segmentation candidate with maximum phrase number in Pipeline 2. 0.7 0.72 0.74 0.76 0.78 0.8 0.82 0.84 0.86 Macro−F1   [PF, PF] [PF+SF, PF] [PF, PF+CF] [PF+SF, PF+CF] Pipeline 1 Pipeline 2 Joint Figure 2: Macro-F1 for positive vs negative classification of tweets with joint and pipelined models.","From Figure 2, we find that the joint model consistently outperforms pipelined baseline methods in all feature settings. The reason is that the pipelined methods suffer from error propaga-tion, since the errors from linguistic-driven and bag-of-word segmentations cannot be corrected by the sentiment classification model. Besides, traditional segmentors do not update the segmentation model with the sentiment information of text. Unlike pipelined methods, the joint model is capable to address these problems by optimizing the segmentation model with the classification results in a joint framework, which yields better performance on sentiment classification. We also find that Pipeline 2 always outperforms Pipeline 1, which indicates the usefulness of phrase-based segmentation for sentiment classification. 6.5 Effect of the beam size N We investigate the influence of beam size N , which is the maximum number of segmentation candidates of a sentence. In this part, we clamp the feature set as [PF+SF, PF+CF], and vary the beam size N in [1,2,4,8,16,32,64]. The experiment results of macro-F1 on the development set are illustrated in Figure 3 (a). The time cost of each training iteration is given in Figure 3 (b).","From Figure 3 (a), we can see that when larger beam size is considered, the classification performance is improved. When beam size is 1, the model stands for the greedy search with the bag-of-words segmentation. When the beam size is s-mall, such as 2, beam search losses many phrasal information of sentences and thus the improvement is not significant. The performance remains steady when beam size is larger than 16.

Figure 3: Sentiment classification of tweets with different beam size N . Figure 3 (b), we can find that the runtime of each training iteration increases with larger beam size. It is intuitive as the joint model with larger beam considers more segmentation results, which increases the training time of the segmentation model. We set beam size as 16 after parameter learning. 6.6 Effect of the top-ranked segmentation number K We investigate how the top-ranked segmentation number K affects the performance of sentiment classification. In this part, we set the feature as [PF+SF, PF+CF], and the beam size as 16. The results of macro-F1 on the development set are illustrated in Figure 4. 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 0.82 0.83 0.84 0.85 0.86 Top−ranked candidate number Macro−F1 Figure 4: Sentiment classification of tweets with different top-ranked segmentation number K.","From Figure 4, we find that the classification performance increases with K being larger. The reason is that when a larger K is used, (1) at training time, the sentiment classifier is built by using more phrasal information from multiple segmentations, which benefits from the ensembles; (2) at test time, the joint model considers several top-ranked segmentations and get the final sentiment polarity through voting. The performance remains stable when K is larger than 7, as the phrasal information has been mostly covered."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we develop a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC) for sentiment analysis. Unlike existing sentiment classification algorithms that build sentiment classifier based on the segmentation results from bag-of-words or separate segmentors, the proposed joint model si-multaneously conducts sentence segmentation and sentiment classification. We introduce a marginal log-likelihood function to optimize the segmentation model, and effectively train the joint model from sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity, without segmentation annotations of sentences. The effectiveness of the joint model has been verified by applying it on the benchmark dataset of Twitter sentiment classification in SemEval 2013. Results show that, the joint model performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods, and outperforms pipelined methods in various settings. In the future, we plan to apply the joint model on other domains, such as movie/product reviews."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Nan Yang, Yajuan Duan, Yaming Sun and Meishan Zhang for their helpful discussions.
