However, most of the existing LM growing methods need an extra monolingual corpus, where additional LM adaption technology is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based bilingual LM growing method, only using the bilingual parallel corpus in SMT. The results show that our method can improve both the perplexity score for LM evaluation and BLEU score for SMT, and significantly outperforms the existing LM growing methods without extra corpus."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["‘ Language Model (LM) Growing’ refers to adding n-grams outside the corpus together with their probabilities into the original LM. This operation is useful as it can make LM perform better through letting it become larger and larger, by only using a small training corpus.","There are various methods for adding n-grams selected by different criteria from a monolingual corpus (Ristad and Thomas, 1995; Niesler and Woodland, 1996; Siu and Ostendorf, 2000; Siivola et al., 2007). However, all of these approaches need additional corpora. Meanwhile the extra corpora from different domains will not result in better LMs (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997; Iyer et al., 1997; Bellegarda, 2004; Koehn and Schroeder,","∗","Part of this work was done as Rui Wang visited in NICT. 2007). In addition, it is very difficult or even impossible to collect an extra large corpus for some special domains such as the TED corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012) or for some rare languages. There-fore, to improve the performance of LMs, without assistance of extra corpus, is one of important research topics in SMT.","Recently, Continues Space Language Model (CSLM), especially Neural Network based Language Model (NNLM) (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010; Le et al., 2011), is being actively used in SMT (Schwenk et al., 2006; Son et al., 2010; Schwenk, 2010; Schwenk et al., 2012; Son et al., 2012; Niehues and Waibel, 2012). One of the main advantages of CSLM is that it can more accurately predic-t the probabilities of the n-grams, which are not in the training corpus. However, in practice, CSLMs have not been widely used in the current SMT systems, due to their too high computational cost.","Vaswani and colleagues (2013) propose a method for reducing the training cost of CSLM and apply it to SMT decoder. However, they do not show their improvement for decoding speed, and their method is still slower than the n-gram LM. There are several other methods for attempt-ing to implement neural network based LM or translation model for SMT (Devlin et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Auli et al., 2013). However, the decoding speed using n-gram LM is still state-of-the-art one. Some approaches calculate the probabilities of the n-grams n-grams before decoding, and store them in the n-gram format (Wang et al., 2013a; Arsoy et al., 2013; Arsoy et al., 2014). The ‘ converted CSLM’ can be directly used in SMT. Though more n-grams which are not in the train-189 ing corpus can be generated by using some of these ‘ converting’ methods, these methods only consider the monolingual information, and do not take the bilingual information into account.","We observe that the translation output of a phrase-based SMT system is concatenation of phrases from the phrase table, whose probabilities can be calculated by CSLM. Based on this observation, a novel neural network based bilingual LM growing method is proposed using the ‘ connecting phrases’. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we will review the existing CSLM converting methods. The new neural network based bilingual LM growing method will be proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, the experiments will be conducted and the results will be analyzed. We will conclude our work in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Existing CSLM Converting Methods","paragraphs":["Traditional Backoff N -gram LMs (BNLMs) have been widely used in many NLP tasks (Zhang and Zhao, 2013; Jia and Zhao, 2014; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012; Xu and Zhao, 2012; Wang et al., 2013b; Jia and Zhao, 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Recently, CSLMs become popular because they can obtain more accurate probability estimation. 2.1 Continues Space Language Model A CSLM implemented in a multi-layer neural network contains four layers: the input layer projects (first layer) all words in the context hi onto the projection layer (second layer); the hidden layer (third layer) and the output layer (fourth layer) achieve the non-liner probability estimation and calculate the LM probability P (wi|hi) for the given context (Schwenk, 2007).","CSLM is able to calculate the probabilities of all words in the vocabulary of the corpus given the context. However, due to too high computational complexity, CSLM is mainly used to calculate the probabilities of a subset of the whole vocabulary (Schwenk, 2007). This subset is called a short-list, which consists of the most frequent words in the vocabulary. CSLM also calculates the sum of the probabilities of all words not included in the short-list by assigning a neuron with the help of BNLM. The probabilities of other words not in the short-list are obtained from an BNLM (Schwenk, 2007; Schwenk, 2010; Wang et al., 2013a).","Let wi and hi be the current word and history, respectively. CSLM with a BNLM calculates the probability P (wi|hi) of wi given hi, as follows: P (wi|hi) =   ","Pc(w i|h","i)","∑","w∈V 0 Pc(w|h","i) Ps(hi) if wi ∈ V0 Pb(wi|hi) otherwise (1) where V0 is the short-list, Pc(·) is the probability calculated by CSLM, ∑","w∈V0 Pc(w|hi) is the summary of probabilities of the neuron for all the words in the short-list, Pb(·) is the probability calculated by the BNLM, and","Ps(hi) = ∑ v∈V","0 Pb(v|hi). (2)","We may regard that CSLM redistributes the probability mass of all words in the short-list, which is calculated by using the n-gram LM. 2.2 Existing Converting Methods As baseline systems, our approach proposed in (Wang et al., 2013a) only re-writes the probabilities from CSLM into the BNLM, so it can only conduct a convert LM with the same size as the original one. The main difference between our proposed method in this paper and our previous approach is that n-grams outside the corpus are generated firstly and the probabilities using CSLM are calculated by using the same method as our previous approach. That is, the proposed new method is the same as our previous one when no grown n-grams are generated.","The method developed by Arsoy and colleagues (Arsoy et al., 2013; Arsoy et al., 2014) adds all the words in the short-list after the tail word of the i-grams to construct the ( i+1)-grams. For example, if the i-gram is “ I want”, then the (i+1)- grams will be “I want *”, where “*” stands for any word in the short list. Then the probabilities of the (i+1)-grams are calculated using ( i+1)-CSLM. So a very large intermediate (i+1)-grams will have to be grown1",", and then be pruned into smaller suitable size using an entropy-based LM pruning method modified from (Stolcke, 1998). The (i+2)- grams are grown using (i+1)-grams, recursively.","1","In practice, the probabilities of all the target/tail words in the short list for the history i-grams can be calculated by the neurons in the output layer at the same time, which will save some time. According to our experiments, the time cost for Arsoy’s growing method is around 4 times more than our proposed method, if the LMs which are 10 times larger than the original one are grown with other settings all the same. 190"]},{"title":"3 Bilingual LM Growing","paragraphs":["The translation output of a phrase-based SMT system can be regarded as a concatenation of phrases in the phrase table (except unknown words). This leads to the following procedure: Step 1. All the n-grams included in the phrase table should be maintained at first. Step 2. The connecting phrases are defined in the following way. The wb","a is a target language phrase starting from the a-th word ending with the b-th word, and βwb","aγ is a phrase including wb","a as a part of it, where β and γ represent any word sequence or none. An i-gram phrase wk","1 wi","k+1 (1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1) is a connecting phrase2",", if : (1) wk","1 is the right (rear) part of one phrase βwk","1 in the phrase table, or (2) wi","k+1 is the left (front) part of one phrase wi k+1γ in the phrase table. After the probabilities are calculated using CSLM (Eqs.1 and 2), we combine the n-grams in the phrase table from Step 1 and the connecting phrases from Step 2. 3.1 Ranking the Connecting Phrases Since the size of connecting phrases is too huge (usually more than one Terabyte), it is necessary to decide the usefulness of connecting phrases for SMT. The more useful connecting phrases can be selected, by ranking the appearing probabilities of the connecting phrases in SMT decoding.","Each line of a phrase table can be simplified (without considering other unrelated scores in the phrase table) as f ||| e ||| P (e|f), (3) where the P (e|f ) means the translation probability from f (source phrase) to e(target phrase), which can be calculated using bilingual parallel training data. In decoding, the probability of a target phrase e appearing in SMT should be","Pt(e) = ∑ f Ps(f) × P (e|f), (4)","2","We are aware that connecting phrases can be applied to not only two phrases, but also three or more. However the appearing probabilities (which will be discussed in Eq. 5 of next subsection) of connecting phrases are approximately estimated. To estimate and compare probabilities of longer phrases in different lengths will lead to serious bias, and the experiments also showed using more than two connecting phrases did not perform well (not shown for limited space), so only two connecting phrases are applied in this paper. where the Ps(f ) means the appearing probability of a source phrase, which can be calculated using source language part in the bilingual training data.","Using Pt(e)3",", we can select the connecting phrases e with high appearing probabilities as the n-grams to be added to the original n-grams. These n-grams are called ‘ grown n-grams’. Namely, we build all the connecting phrases at first, and then we use the appearing probabilities of the connecting phrases to decide which connecting phrases should be selected. For an i-gram connecting phrase wk","1 wi","k+1, where wk","1 is part of βwk","1 and wi","k+1 is part of wi","k+1γ (the βwk","1 and wi","k+1γ are from the phrase table), the probability of the connecting phrases can be roughly estimated as","Pcon(wk","1 wi","k+1) = i−1 ∑ k=1(∑","β Pt(βwk","1 )×","∑","γ Pt(wi k+1γ)). (5) A threshold for Pcon(wk","1 wi","k+1) is set, and only the connecting phrases whose appearing probabilities are higher than the threshold will be selected as the grown n-grams. 3.2 Calculating the Probabilities of Grown N -grams Using CSLM To our bilingual LM growing method, a 5-gram LM and n-gram ( n=2,3,4,5) CSLMs are built by using the target language of the parallel corpus, and the phrase table is learned from the parallel corpus.","The probabilities of unigram in the original n-gram LM will be maintained as they are. The n-grams from the bilingual phrase table will be grown by using the ‘ connecting phrases’ method. As the whole connecting phrases are too huge, we use the ranking method to select the more useful connecting phrases. The distribution of different n-grams ( n=2,3,4,5) of the grown LMs are set as the same as the original LM.","The probabilities of the grown n-grams (n=2,3,4,5) are calculated using the 2,3,4,5-CSLM, respectively. If the tail (target) words of the grown n-grams are not in the short-list of CSLM, the Pb(·) in Eq. 1 will be applied to calculate their probabilities. 3 This Pt(e) hence provides more bilingual information,","in comparison with using monolingual target LMs only. 191","We combine the n-grams ( n=1,2,3,4,5) together and re-normalize the probabilities and backoff weights of the grown LM. Finally the original BNLM and the grown LM are interpolated. The entire process is illustrated in Figure 1.

The Moses phrase-based SMT system was applied (Koehn et al., 2007), together with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for alignment and MERT (Och, 2003) for tuning on the development data. Fourteen standard SMT features were used: five translation model scores, one word penalty score, seven distortion scores, and one LM score. The translation performance was measured by the case-insensitive BLEU on the tokenized test data.","We used the patent data for the Chinese to English patent translation subtask from the NTCIR-9 patent translation task (Goto et al., 2011). The parallel training, development, and test data sets consist of 1 million (M), 2,000, and 2,000 sentences, respectively.","Using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002; Stolcke et al., 2011), we trained a 5-gram LM with the interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing method using the 1M English training sentences containing 42M words without cutoff. The 2,3,4,5-CSLMs were trained on the same 1M training sentences using CSLM toolkit (Schwenk, 2007; Schwenk, 2010). The settings for CSLMs were: input layer of the same dimension as vocabulary size (456K), projection layer of dimension 256 for each word, hidden layer of dimension 384 and output layer (short-list) of dimension 8192, which were recommended in the CSLM toolkit and (Wang et al., 2013a)4",".","4","Arsoy used around 55 M words as the corpus, including 4.2 Results The experiment results were divided into four groups: the original BNLMs (BN), the CSLM Re-ranking (RE), our previous converting (WA), the Arsoy’s growing, and our growing methods. For our bilingual LM growing method, 5 bilingual grown LMs (BI-1 to 5) were conducted in increas-ing sizes. For the method of Arsoy, 5 grown LMs (AR-1 to 5) with similar size of BI-1 to 5 were also conducted, respectively.","For the CSLM re-ranking, we used CSLM to re-rank the 100-best lists of SMT. Our previous converted LM, Arsoy’s grown LMs and bilingual grown LMs were interpolated with the original BNLMs, using default setting of SRILM5",". To reduce the randomness of MERT, we used two methods for tuning the weights of different SMT features, and two BLEU scores are corresponding to these two methods. The BLEU-s indicated that the same weights of the BNLM (BN) features were used for all the SMT systems. The BLEU-i indicated that the MERT was run independently by three times and the average BLEU scores were taken.","We also performed the paired bootstrap resampling test (Koehn, 2004)6",". Two thousands samples were sampled for each significance test. The marks at the right of the BLEU score indicated whether the LMs were significantly better/worse than the Arsoy’s grown LMs with the same IDs for SMT (“++/−−”: significantly better/worse at α = 0.01, “+/−”: α = 0.05, no mark: not significantly better/worse at α = 0.05).","From the results shown in Table 1, we can get the following observations:","(1) Nearly all the bilingual grown LMs outperformed both BNLM and our previous converted LM on PPL and BLEU. As the size of grown LMs is increased, the PPL always decreased and the BLEU scores trended to increase.
