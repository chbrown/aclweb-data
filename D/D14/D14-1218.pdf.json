To solve the challenge of ordering a set of sentences into coherent order, existing approaches focus mostly on defining and using sophisticated features to capture the cross-sentence argumentation logic and syntactic relationships. But both argumentation semantics and cross-sentence syntax (such as coreference and tense rules) are very hard to formalize. In this paper, we introduce a neural network model for the coherence task based on distributed sentence representation. The proposed approach learns a syntactico-semantic representation for sentences automatically, using either recurrent or recursive neural networks. The architecture obviated the need for feature engineering, and learns sentence representations, which are to some extent able to capture the ‘rules’ governing coherent sentence structure. The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines and generates the state-of-art performance in standard coherence evaluation tasks1","."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Coherence is a central aspect in natural language processing of multi-sentence texts. It is essential in generating readable text that the text planner compute which ordering of clauses (or sentences; we use them interchangeably in this paper) is likely to support understanding and avoid confusion. As Mann and Thompson (1988) define it,","A text is coherent when it can be ex-","plained what role each clause plays with","regard to the whole.","1","Code available at stanford.edu/j̃iweil/ or by request from the first author. Several researchers in the 1980s and 1990s addressed the problem, the most influential of which include: Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; (Mann and Thompson, 1988)), which defined about 25 relations that govern clause interdependencies and ordering and give rise to text tree structures; the stepwise assembly of semantic graphs to support adductive inference toward the best explanation (Hobbs et al., 1988); Discourse Representation Theory (DRT; (Lascarides and Asher, 1991)), a formal semantic model of discourse contexts that constrain coreference and quantification scoping; the model of intentionoriented conversation blocks and their stack-based queueing to model attention flow (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), and more recently an inventory of a hundred or so binary inter-clause relations and associated annotated corpus (Penn Discourse Treebank. Work in text planning implemented some of these models, especially operationalized RST (Hovy, 1988) and explanation relations (Moore and Paris, 1989) to govern the planning of coherent paragraphs. Other computational work defined so called schemas (McKeown, 1985), frames with fixed sequences of clause types to achieve stereotypical communicative intentions.","Little of this work survives. Modern research tries simply to order a collection of clauses or sentences without giving an account of which order(s) is/are coherent or what the overall text structure is. The research focuses on identifying and defining a set of increasingly sophisticated features by which algorithms can be trained to propose order-ings. Features being explored include the clause entities, organized into a grid (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008), coreference clues to ordering (Elsner and Charniak, 2008), named-entity categories (Eisner and Charniak, 2011), syntactic features (Louis and Nenkova, 2012), and others. Besides being time-intensive (feature engineering usually requites considerable 2039 Figure 1: Illustrations of coherent (positive) vs not-coherent (negative) training examples. effort and can depend greatly on upstream feature extraction algorithms), it is not immediately ap-parent which aspects of a clause or a coherent text to consider when deciding on ordering. More importantly, the features developed to date are still incapable of fully specifying the acceptable ordering(s) within a context, let alone describe why they are coherent.","Recently, deep architectures, have been applied to various natural language processing tasks (see Section 2). Such deep connectionist architectures learn a dense, low-dimensional representation of their problem in a hierarchical way that is capable of capturing both semantic and syntactic aspects of tokens (e.g., (Bengio et al., 2006)), entities, N-grams (Wang and Manning, 2012), or phrases (Socher et al., 2013). More recent researches have begun looking at higher level distributed representations that transcend the token level, such as sentence-level (Le and Mikolov, 2014) or even discourse-level (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) aspects. Just as words combine to form meaningful sentences, can we take advantage of distributional semantic representations to explore the composition of sentences to form coherent meanings in paragraphs?","In this paper, we demonstrate that it is feasible to discover the coherent structure of a text using distributed sentence representations learned in a deep learning framework. Specifically, we consider a WINDOW approach for sentences, as shown in Figure 1, where positive examples are windows of sentences selected from original articles generated by humans, and negatives examples are generated by random replacements2",". The semantic representations for terms and sentences are obtained through optimizing the neural network framework based on these positive vs negative ex-","2","Our approach is inspired by Collobert et al.’s idea (2011) that a word and its context form a positive training sample while a random word in that same context gives a negative training sample, when training word embeddings in the deep learning framework. amples and the proposed model produces state-of-art performance in multiple standard evaluations for coherence models (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We describe related work in Section 2, then describe how to obtain a distributed representation for sentences in Section 3, and the window composition in Section 4. Experimental results are shown in Section 5, followed by a conclusion."]},{"title":"2 Related WorkCoherence","paragraphs":["In addition to the early computational work discussed above, local coherence was extensively studied within the modeling framework of Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Poesio et al., 2004), which provides principles to form a coherence metric (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000; Hasler, 2004). Centering approaches suffer from a severe dependence on manually annotated input.","A recent popular approach is the entity grid model introduced by Barzilay and Lapata (2008) , in which sentences are represented by a vector of discourse entities along with their grammatical roles (e.g., subject or object). Probabilities of transitions between adjacent sentences are derived from entity features and then concatenated to a document vector representation, which is used as input to machine learning classifiers such as SVM. Many frameworks have extended the entity approach, for example, by pre-grouping entities based on semantic relatedness (Filippova and Strube, 2007) or adding more useful types of features such as coreference (Elsner and Charniak, 2008), named entities (Eisner and Charniak, 2011), and discourse relations (Lin et al., 2011).","Other systems include the global graph model (Guinaudeau and Strube, 2013) which projects entities into a global graph. Louis and Nenkova (2012) introduced an HMM system in which the coherence between adjacent sentences is modeled by a hidden Markov framework captured by the 2040 Figure 2: Sentential compositionality obtained from (a) recurrent / (b) recursive neural network. The bottom layer represents word vectors in the sentence. The top layer hs denotes the resulting sentence vector. transition rules of different topics. Recurrent and Recursive Neural Networks In the context of NLP, recurrent neural networks view a sentence as a sequence of tokens and in-corporate information from the past (i.e., preced-ing tokens) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997; Sutskever et al., 2011) for acquisition of the current output. At each step, the recurrent network takes as input both the output of previous steps and the current token, convolutes the inputs, and forwards the result to the next step. It has been successfully applied to tasks such as language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010) and spoken language understanding (Mesnil et al., 2013). The advantage of recurrent network is that it does not depend on external deeper structure (e.g., parse tree) and is easy to implement. However, in the recurrent framework, long-distance dependencies are difficult to capture due to the vanishing gradient problem (Bengio et al., 1994); two tokens may be structurally close to each other, even though they are far away in word sequence3",".","Recursive neural networks comprise another class of architecture, one that relies and operates on structured inputs (e.g., parse trees). It computes the representation for each parent based on its children iteratively in a bottom-up fashion. A series of variations have been proposed, each tailored to different task-specific requirements, such as Matrix-Vector RNN (Socher et al., 2012) that represents every word as both a vector and a matrix, or Recursive Neural Tensor Networks (Socher et al., 2013) that allow the model to have greater","3","For example, a verb and its corresponding direct object can be far away in terms of tokens if many adjectives lies in between, but they are adjacent in the parse tree (Irsoy and Cardie, 2013). interactions between the input vectors. Many tasks have benefited from this recursive framework, including parsing (Socher et al., 2011b), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011a). 2.1 Distributed Representations Both recurrent and recursive networks require a vector representation of each input token. Distributed representations for words were first proposed in (Rumelhart et al., 1988) and have been successful for statistical language modeling (Elman, 1990). Various deep learning architectures have been explored to learn these embeddings in an unsupervised manner from a large corpus (Bengio et al., 2006; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2013), which might have different generalization capabilities and are able to capture the semantic meanings depending on the specific task at hand. These vector representations can to some extent capture interesting semantic relationships, such as King −man ≈ Queue−woman (Mikolov et al., 2010), and recently have been successfully used in various NLP applications, including named entity recognition, tagging, segmentation (Wang et al., 2013), and machine translation (e.g.,(Collobert and Weston, 2008; Zou et al., 2013))."]},{"title":"3 Sentence Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we demonstrate the strategy adopted to compute a vector for a sentence given the sequence of its words and their embeddings. We implemented two approaches, Recurrent and Recursive neural networks, following the descriptions in for example (Mikolov et al., 2010; Sutskever et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013). As 2041 the details of both approaches can be readily found there, we make this section brief and omit the details for brevity.","Let s denote a sentence, comprised of a sequence of words s = {w1, w2, ..., wns}, where ns denotes the number of words within sentence s.

Recurrent Sentence Representation (Recurrent) The recurrent network captures certain general considerations regarding sentential compositionality.

Recursive Sentence Representation (Recursive) Recursive sentence representation relies on the structure of parse trees, where each leaf node of the tree corresponds to a word from the original sentence. It computes a representation for each parent node based on its immediate children recursively in a bottom-up fashion until reaching the root of the tree. Concretely, for a given parent p in the tree and its two children c1 (associated with vector representation hc1) and c2 (associated with vector representation hc2), standard recursive networks calculates hp for p as follows: hp = f (WRecursive · [hc1, hc2] + bRecursive) (3) where [hc1, hc2] denotes the concatenating vector for children vector representation hc1 and hc2.

As shown in Figure 1, cliques taken from original articles are treated as coherent and those with sentences randomly replaced are used as negative examples. .","The sentence convolution algorithm adopted in this paper is defined by a three-layer neural network, i.e., sentence-level input layer, hidden layer, and overall output layer as shown in Figure 3. For-mally, each clique C takes as input a (L × K) × 1 vector hC by concatenating the embeddings of all its contained sentences, denoted as hC = [hs1, hs2, ..., hsL]. (Note that if we wish to classify the first and last sentences and include their context, we require special beginning and ending sentence vectors, which are defined as h<S> for sstart and h</S> for send respectively.)","Let H denote the number of neurons in the hidden (second) layer. Then each of the hidden layers takes as input hC and performs the convolution using a non-linear tanh function, parametrized by Wsen and bsen. The concatenating output vector for hidden layers, defined as qC , can therefore be rewritten as: qC = f (Wsen × hC + bsen) (4) where Wsen is a H × (L × K) dimensional matrix and bsen is a H × 1 dimensional bias vector.","4","instead of a binary classification (correct/incorrect), another commonly used approach is the contrastive approach that minimizes the score function max(0, 1 − s + sc) (Collobert et al., 2011; Smith and Eisner, 2005). s denotes the score of a true (coherent) window and sc the score of a corrupt (containing incoherence) one) in an attempt to make the score of true windows larger and corrupt windows smaller. We tried the contrastive one for both recurrent and recursive networks but the binary approach constantly outperformed the contrastive one in this task. 2042 Figure 3: An example of coherence model based on a window of sentences (clique).","The output layer takes as input qC and generates a scalar using linear function U T","qC + b.

We also report performances of models from Louis and Nenkova’s work that combine HMM and entity/content models in a unified framework.

The Graph Based Approach outperforms the original entity approach in some of feature set-tings (Guinaudeau and Strube, 2013).","As can be seen in Table 1, the proposed frameworks (both recurrent and recursive) obtain state-of-art performance and outperform all existing baselines by a large margin. One interpretation is that the abstract sentence vector representations computed by the deep learning framework is more powerful in capturing exactly the relevant the semantic/logical/syntactic features in coherent contexts than features or other representations developed by human feature engineering are.","Another good quality of the deep learning framework is that it can be trained easily and makes unnecessary the effort required of feature engineering.

Scrutiny of the corpus reveals that articles reporting earthquakes exhibit a more consistent structure: earthquake outbreak, describing the center and intensity of the earthquake, injuries and rescue operations, etc., while accident articles usually exhibit more diverse scenarios. 5.2 Readability Assessment Barzilay and Lapata (2008) proposed a readability assessment task for stylistic judgments about the difficulty of reading a document. Their approach combines a coherence system with Schwarm and Ostendorf’s (2005) readability features to classify documents into two categories, more readable (coherent) documents and less readable ones. The evaluation accesses the ability to differentiate “easy to read” documents from difficult ones of each model. 5.2.1 Dataset Barzilay and Lapata’s (2008) data corpus is from the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Britannica Elementary, the latter being a new version targeted at children. Both versions contain 107 articles. The Encyclopedia Britannica corpus contains an average of 83.1 sentences per document and the Britannica Elementary contains 36.6. The encyclopedia lemmas are written by different authors and consequently vary considerably in structure and vocabulary choice. Early researchers assumed that the children version (Britannica Elementary) is easier to read, hence more coherent than documents in Encyclopedia Britannica. This is a somewhat questionable assumption that needs further investigation. 5.2.2 Training and Testing Existing coherence approaches again apply a pairwise ranking strategy and the article associated with the higher score is considered to be the more readable. As the replacement strategy for generating negative example is apparently not well fitted to this task, we adopted the following training framework: we use all sliding windows of sentences from coherent documents (documents from Britannica Elementary) as positive examples, 2045 Approach Accuracy Recurrent 0.803 Recursive 0.828 Graph Approach 0.786 Entity 0.509 S&O 0.786 Entity+S&O 0.888 Table 2: Comparison of Different Coherence Frameworks on Readability Assessment.

During testing, we turn to Equations 8 and 9 for pairwise comparison. We adopted five-fold cross-validation in the same way as in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008; Guinaudeau and Strube, 2013) for fair comparison. Parameters were tuned within each training set also using five-fold cross-validation.
