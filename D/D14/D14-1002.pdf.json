We observe, identify, and detect naturally occurring signals of interestingness in click transitions on the Web between source and target documents, which we collect from commercial Web browser logs. The DSSM is trained on millions of Web transitions, and maps source-target document pairs to feature vectors in a latent space in such a way that the distance between source documents and their corresponding interesting targets in that space is minimized. The effectiveness of the DSSM is demonstrated using two interestingness tasks: automatic highlighting and contextual entity search. The results on large-scale, real-world datasets show that the semantics of documents are important for modeling interestingness and that the DSSM leads to significant quality improvement on both tasks, outperforming not only the classic document models that do not use semantics but also state-of-the-art topic models."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Tasks of predicting what interests a user based on the document she is reading are fundamental to many online recommendation systems. A recent survey is due to Ricci et al. (2011). In this paper, we exploit the use of a deep semantic model for two such interestingness tasks in which document semantics play a crucial role: automatic highlighting and contextual entity search.","Automatic Highlighting. In this task we want a recommendation system to automatically discover the entities (e.g., a person, location, organization etc.) that interest a user when reading a document and to highlight the corresponding text spans, referred to as keywords afterwards. We show in this study that document semantics are among the most important factors that influence what is perceived as interesting to the user. For example, we observe in Web browsing logs that when a user reads an article about a movie, she is more likely to browse to an article about an actor or character than to another movie or the director."]},{"title":"Contextual entity search.","paragraphs":["After identifying the keywords that represent the entities of interest to the user, we also want the system to recommend new, interesting documents by searching the Web for supplementary information about these entities. The task is challenging because the same keywords often refer to different entities, and interesting supplementary information to the highlighted entity is highly sensitive to the semantic context. For example, “Paul Simon” can refer to many people, such as the singer and the senator. Consider an article about the music of Paul Simon and another about his life. Related content about his up-coming concert tour is much more interesting in the first context, while an article about his family is more interesting in the second.","At the heart of these two tasks is the notion of interestingness. In this paper, we model and make use of this notion of interestingness with a deep semantic similarity model (DSSM). The model, extending from the deep neural networks shown recently to be highly effective for speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2013) and computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Markoff, 2014), is semantic because it maps documents to feature vectors in a latent semantic space, also known as semantic representations. The model is deep because it employs a neural network with several hidden layers including a special convolutional-pooling structure to identify keywords and extract hidden semantic features at different levels of abstractions, layer by layer. The semantic representation is computed through a deep neural network after its training by backpropagation with respect to an objective tailored 2 to the respective interestingness tasks. We obtain naturally occurring “interest” signals by observing Web browser transitions, from a source document to a target document, in Web usage logs of a commercial browser. Our training data is sampled from these transitions.","The use of the DSSM to model interestingness is motivated by the recent success of applying related deep neural networks to computer vision (Krizhevshy et al. 2012; Markoff, 2014), speech recognition (Hinton et al. 2012), text processing (Collobert et al. 2011), and Web search (Huang et al. 2013). Among them, (Huang et al. 2013) is most relevant to our work. They also use a deep neural network to map documents to feature vectors in a latent semantic space. However, their model is designed to represent the relevance between queries and documents, which differs from the notion of interestingness between documents studied in this paper. It is often the case that a user is interested in a document because it provides supplementary information about the entities or concepts she encounters when reading another document although the overall contents of the second documents is not highly relevant. For example, a user may be interested in knowing more about the history of University of Washington after reading the news about President Obama’s visit to Seattle. To better model interestingness, we extend the model of Huang et al. (2013) in two significant aspects. First, while Huang et al. treat a document as a bag of words for semantic mapping, the DSSM treats a document as a sequence of words and tries to discover prominent keywords. These keywords represent the entities or concepts that might interest users, via the convolutional and max-pooling layers which are related to the deep models used for computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2013) and speech recognition (Deng et al., 2013a) but are not used in Huang et al.’s model. The DSSM then forms the high-level semantic representation of the whole document based on these keywords. Second, instead of directly computing the document relevance score using cosine similarity in the learned semantic space, as in Huang et al. (2013), we feed the features derived from the semantic representations of documents to a ranker which is trained in a supervised manner. As a result, a document that is not highly relevant to another document a user is reading (i.e., the distance between their derived feature    1 We stress here that, although the click signal is available to form a dataset and a gold standard ranker (to be described in vectors is big) may still have a high score of interestingness because the former provides useful information about an entity mentioned in the latter. Such information and entity are encoded, respectively, by (some subsets of) the semantic features in their corresponding documents. In Sections 4 and 5, we empirically demonstrate that the aforementioned two extensions lead to significant quality improvements for the two interestingness tasks presented in this paper.","Before giving a formal description of the DSSM in Section 3, we formally define the interestingness function, and then introduce our data set of naturally occurring interest signals."]},{"title":"2 The Notion of Interestingness","paragraphs":["Let","be the set of all documents. Following Gamon et al. (2013), we formally define the interestingness modeling task as learning the mapping function:  :   →    where the function , is the quantified degree of interest that the user has in the target document ∈ after or while reading the source document ∈ .","Our notion of a document is meant in its most general form as a string of raw unstructured text. That is, the interestingness function should not rely on any document structure such as title tags, hyperlinks, etc., or Web interaction data. In our tasks, documents can be formed either from the plain text of a webpage or as a text span in that plain text, as will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5."]},{"title":"2.1 Data","paragraphs":["We can observe many naturally occurring manifestations of interestingness on the Web. For example, on Twitter, users follow shared links embedded in tweets. Arguably the most frequent signal, however, occurs in Web browsing events where users click from one webpage to another via hyperlinks. When a user clicks on a hyperlink, it is reasonable to assume that she is interested in learning more about the anchor, modulo cases of erroneous clicks. Aggregate clicks can therefore serve as a proxy for interestingness. That is, for a given source document, target documents that attract the most clicks are more interesting than documents that attract fewer clicks1",". Section 4), our task is to model interestingness between unstructured documents, i.e., without access to any document structure or Web interaction data. Thus, in our experiments, 3","We collect a large dataset of user browsing events from a commercial Web browser. Specifically, we sample 18 million occurrences of a user click from one Wikipedia page to another during a one year period. We restrict our browsing events to Wikipedia since its pages tend to contain many anchors (79 on average, where on average 42 have a unique target URL). Thus, they attract enough traffic for us to obtain robust browsing transition data2",". We group together all transitions originat-ing from the same page and randomly hold out 20% of the transitions for our evaluation data (EVAL), 20% for training the DSSM described in Section 3.2 (TRAIN_1), and the remaining 60% for training our task specific rankers described in Section 3.3 (TRAIN_2).

In what follows, we use lower-case bold letters, such as , to denote column vectors, to denote the","element of , and upper-case letters, such as , to denote matrices. Input Layer . It takes two steps to convert a document , which is a sequence of words, into a vector representation for the input layer of the network: (1) convert each word in to a word vector, and (2) build by concatenating these word vectors. To convert a word into a word vector, we first represent by a one-hot vector using a vocabulary that contains high frequent words ( 150K in this study). Then, following Huang et al. (2013), we map to a separate tri-letter vector. Consider the word “#dog#”, where # is a word boundary symbol. The nonzero elements in its tri-letter vector are “#do”, “dog”, and “og#”. We then form the word vector of by concatenating its one-hot vector and its tri-letter vector. It is worth noting that the tri-letter vector complements the one-hot vector representation in two aspects. First, different OOV (out of vocabulary) words can be represented by tri-letter vectors with few collisions. Second, spelling variations of the same word can be mapped to the points that are close to each other in the tri-letter space. Although the number of unique English words on the Web is extremely large, the total number of distinct triletters in English is limited (restricted to the most frequent 30K in this study). As a result, incorporating tri-letter vectors substantially improves the representation power of word vectors while keep-ing their size small.","To form our input layer using word vectors, we first identify a text span with a high degree of relevance, called focus, in using task-specific heuristics (see Sections 4 and 5 respectively). Sec-ond, we form by concatenating each word vector in the focus and a vector that is the summation of all other word vectors, as shown in Figure 1. Since the length of the focus is much smaller than that of its document, is able to capture the contextual information (for the words in the focus) Web document into plain text, which is white-space to-kenized and lowercased. Numbers are retained and no stemming is performed. 2 We utilize the May 3, 2013 English Wikipedia dump consisting of roughly 4.1 million articles from http://dumps.wikimedia.org. Figure 1: Illustration of the network architecture and information flow of the DSSM  4 useful to the corresponding tasks, with a manage-able vector size. Convolutional Layer . A convolutional layer extracts local features around each word   in a word sequence of length as follows. We first generate a contextual vector by concatenating the word vectors of and its surrounding words defined by a window (the window size is set to 3 in this paper). Then, we generate for each word a local feature vector using a tanh activation function and a linear projection matrix , which is the same across all windows in the word sequence, as:   tanh     ,where 1... (1) Max-pooling Layer . The size of the output depends on the number of words in the word sequence. Local feature vectors have to be combined to obtain a global feature vector, with a fixed size independent of the document length, in order to apply subsequent standard affine layers. We design by adopting the max operation over each “time” of the sequence of vectors computed by (1), which forces the network to retain only the most useful, partially invariant local features produced by the convolutional layer:    max ,..., u    (2) where the max operation is performed for each dimension of across 1,..., respectively.","That convolutional and max-pooling layers are able to discover prominent keywords of a document can be demonstrated using the procedure in Figure 2 using a toy example. First, the convolutional layer of (1) generates for each word in a 5-word document a 4-dimensional local feature vector, which represents a distribution of four topics. For example, the most prominent topic of within its three word context window is the first topic, denoted by 1, and the most prominent topic of is 3. Second, we use max-pooling of (2) to form a global feature vector, which represents the topic distribution of the whole document. We see that 1 and 3 are two prominent topics. Then, for each prominent topic, we trace back to the local feature vector that survives max-pooling:  ","1 max ,...,   1    1   ","3 max ,...,   3    3.  Finally, we label the corresponding words of these local feature vectors, and , as keywords of the document.","Figure 3 presents a sample of document snippets and their keywords detected by the DSSM according to the procedure elaborated in Figure 2. It is interesting to see that many names are identified as keywords although the DSSM is not designed explicitly for named entity recognition. Fully-Connected Layers and . The fixed sized global feature vector of (2) is then fed to several standard affine network layers, which are stacked and interleaved with nonlinear activation functions, to extract highly non-linear features at the output layer.

An alternative approach The loss function in (6) has a shape similar to the hinge loss used in SVMs. Because of the use of the cosine similarity function, we add a scaling factor that magnifies ∆ from [-2, 2] to a larger range. Empirically, the value of makes no difference as long as it is large enough. In the experiments, we set 10 . Because the loss function is differentiable, optimizing the model parameters can be done using gradient-based methods. Due to space limitations, we omit the derivation of the gradient of the loss function, for which readers are referred to related derivations (e.g., Collobert et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2014).","In our experiments we trained DSSMs using mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent.

The DSSM trainer is implemented using a GPU-accelerated linear algebra library, which is developed on CUDA 5.5.

However, we did not find a clear empirical advantage over the simpler early stop approach in a pilot study, hence we adopted the latter in the experiments in this paper. Our approach adjusts the learning rate during the course of model training. Starting with 1.0 , after each epoch (a pass over the entire training data), the learning rate is adjusted as 0.5 if the loss on validation data (held-out from TRAIN_1) is not reduced. The training stops if either is smaller than a preset threshold (0.0001) or the loss on training data can no longer be reduced significantly.

The two other sources of semantic features are used as a point of comparison to the DSSM. One is a generative semantic model (Joint Transi-tion Topic model, or JTT) (Gamon et al. 2013). JTT is an LDA-style model (Blei et al. 2003) that is trained jointly on source and target documents linked by browsing transitions.

For TORSO and TAIL, we found the average number of anchors to be 94 (52 unique targets) and 41 (19 unique targets), respectively.","Clearly, the semantics of the documents form important signals for this task: WCAT, JTT, DSSM_BOW, and DSSM all significantly boost the performance over NSF alone. There are two interesting comparisons to consider: (a) manual semantics vs. learned semantics; and (b) deep semantic models vs. generative topic models. On (a), we observe somewhat surprisingly that the learned DSSM produces features that outperform the thousands of features coming from manually (editor) assigned Wikipedia category features (WCAT), in all but the TAIL where the two perform statistically the same. In contrast, features from the generative model (JTT) perform worse than WCAT across the board except on TAIL where JTT and WCAT are statistically tied. On (b), we observe that DSSM outperforms a state-of-the-art generative model (JTT) on HEAD and TORSO. On TAIL, they are statistically indistinguishable.","We turn now to inspecting the scenario where features are only drawn from the source document (Rows 1-8 in Table 1).

We found that adding the cosine 8 features to NSF+DSSM does not lead to any improvement. We also combined NSF with solely the cosine features from DSSM (i.e., without the other semantic features drawn from its output layers). But we still found no improvement over using NSF alone.

To verify the importance of using contextual information, we compare two different ways of forming the term vector of a source document. The first only uses the entity text (Row 1). The second (Row 2) uses both the entity text and and its surrounding text in a 200-word window (i.e., the entire source document). Results show that the model using contextual information is significantly better. Therefore, all the other models in this section use both the entity texts and their surrounding text.","WTM (Row 3) is our implementation of the word translation model for IR (Berger and Lafferty 1999; Gao et al. 2010). WTM defines the interestingness score as:   ,  ∏∑   |      |   ∈   ∈ ,  # Models @1 @3 AUC 1 BM25 (entity) 0.133 0.195 0.583 2 BM25 0.142 0.227 0.675 3 WTM 0.191 0.287 0.678 4 BLTM 0.214 0.306 0.704 5 DSSM","0.259* ","0.356* ","0.711*  6 DSSM_BOW 0.223 0.322 0.699 7 Baseline ranker 0.283 0.360 0.723 8 7 + DSSM(1)","0.301#","0.385#","0.758#"," 9 7 + DSSM(600)","0.327## ","0.402## 0.782## Table 2: Contextual entity search task performance (NDCG @ K and AUC). * indicates statistical significance over all non-shaded single model results (Rows 1 to 6) using t-test ( 0.05). # indicates statistical significance over results in Row 7. ## indicates statistical significance over results in Rows 7 and 8.    9 where   | is the unigram probability of word   in , and   |  is the probability of translating  into  , trained on source-target document pairs using EM (Brown et al. 1993). The translation-based approach allows any pair of non-identical but semantically related words to have a nonzero matching score. As a result, it significantly outperforms BM25.","BTLM (Row 4) follows the best performing bilingual topic model described in Gao et al. (2011), which is an extension of PLSA (Hofmann 1999). The model is trained on source-target document pairs using the EM algorithm with a constraint enforcing a source document and its target document to not only share the same prior topic distribution, but to also have similar frac-tions of words assigned to each topic. BLTM defines the interestingness score between s and t as:   ,  ∏∑|     |     ∈ .  The model assumes the following story of generating from . First, for each topic a word distribution is selected from a Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter . Second, given , a topic distribution","is drawn from a Dirichlet prior with parameter . Finally, is generated word by word. Each word is generated by first selecting a topic according to",", and then drawing a word from . We see that BLTM models interestingness by taking into account the semantic topic distribution of the entire documents. Our results in Table 2 show that BLTM outperforms WTM by a significant margin in both NDCG and AUC.","DSSM (Row 5) outperforms all the competing single models, including the state-of-the-art topic model BLTM. Now, we inspect the difference between DSSM and BLTM in detail. Although both models strive to generate the semantic representation of a document, they use different modeling approaches. BLTM by nature is a generative model. The semantic representation in BLTM is a distribution of hidden semantic topics. Such a distribution is learned using Maximum Likelihood Estimation in an unsupervised manner, i.e., max-imizing the log-likelihood of the source-target document pairs in the training data. On the other hand, DSSM represents documents as points in a hidden semantic space using a supervised learning method, i.e., paired documents are closer in that latent space than unpaired ones. We believe that the superior performance of DSSM is largely due to the fact that the model parameters are discriminatively trained using an objective that is tailored to the interestingness task.","In addition to the difference in training methods, DSSM and BLTM also use different model structures. BLTM treats a document as a bag of words (thus losing some important contextual information such as word order and inter-word dependencies), and generates semantic representations of documents using linear projection. DSSM, on the other hand, treats text as a sequence of words and better captures local and global context, and generates highly non-linear semantic features via a deep neural network. To further verify our analysis, we inspect the results of a variant of DSSM, denoted as DSSM_BOW (Row 6), where the convolution and max-pooling layers are removed. This model treats a document as a bag of words, just like BLTM. These results demonstrate that the effectiveness of DSSM can also be attributed to the convolutional architecture in the neural network, in addition to being deep and being discriminative.","We turn now to discussing the ranker results in Rows 7 to 9. The baseline ranker (Row 7) uses 158 features, including many counts and single model scores, such as BM25 and WMT. DSSM (Row 5) alone is quite effective, being close in performance to the baseline ranker with non-DSSM features. Integrating the DSSM score computed in (5) as one single feature into the ranker (Row 8) leads to a significant improvement over the baseline. The best performing combination (Row 9) is obtained by incorporating the DSSM feature vectors of source and target documents (i.e., 600 features in total) in the ranker."]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["We thus conclude that on both tasks, automatic highlighting and contextual entity search, features drawn from the output layers of our deep semantic model result in significant gains after being added to a set of non-semantic features, and in comparison to other types of semantic models used in the past."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["In addition to the notion of relevance as described in Section 1, related to interestingness is also the notion of salience (also called aboutness) (Gamon et al. 2013; 2014; Parajpe 2009; Yih et al. 2006). Salience is the centrality of a term to the content of a document. Although salience and interestingness interact, the two are not the same. For example, in a news article about President Obama’s visit to Seattle, Obama is salient, yet the average user would probably not be interested in learning more about Obama while reading that article. 10","There are many systems that identify popular content in the Web or recommend content (e.g., Bandari et al. 2012; Lerman and Hogg 2010; Szabo and Huberman 2010), which is closely related to the highlighting task. In contrast to these approaches, we strive to predict what term a user is likely to be interested in when reading content, which may or may not be the same as the most popular content that is related to the current document. It has empirically been demonstrated in Gamon et al. (2013) that popularity is in fact a rather poor predictor for interestingness. The task of contextual entity search, which is formulated as an information retrieval problem in this paper, is also related to research on entity resolution (Stefanidis et al. 2013).","Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al. 1990) is arguably the earliest semantic model designed for IR. Generative topic models widely used for IR include PLSA (Hofmann 1990) and LDA (Blei et al. 2003). Recently, these models have been extended to handle cross-lingual cases, where there are pairs of corresponding documents in different languages (e.g., Dumais et al. 1997; Gao et al. 2011; Platt et al. 2010; Yih et al. 2011)."]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["By exploiting deep architectures, deep learning techniques are able to automatically discover from training data the hidden structures and the associated features at different levels of abstraction useful for a variety of tasks (e.g., Collobert et al. 2011; Hinton et al. 2012; Socher et al. 2012; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Gao et al. 2014). Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2010) propose the most original approach based on an unsupervised version of the deep neural network to discover the hierarchical semantic structure embedded in queries and documents. Huang et al. (2013) significantly extends the approach so that the deep neural network can be trained on large-scale query-document pairs giving much better performance. The use of the convolutional neural network for text processing, central to our DSSM, was also described in Collobert et al. (2011) and Shen et al. (2014) but with very different applications. The DSSM described in Section 3 can be viewed as a variant of the deep neural network models used in these previous studies."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Modeling interestingness is fundamental to many online recommendation systems. We obtain naturally occurring interest signals by observing Web browsing transitions where users click from one webpage to another. We propose to model this “interestingness” with a deep semantic similarity model (DSSM), based on deep neural networks with special convolutional-pooling structure, mapping source-target document pairs to feature vectors in a latent semantic space. We train the DSSM using browsing transitions between documents. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two interestingness tasks: automatic highlighting and contextual entity search. Our results on large-scale, real-world datasets show that the semantics of documents computed by the DSSM are important for modeling interestingness and that the new model leads to significant improvements on both tasks. DSSM is shown to outperform not only the classic document models that do not use (latent) semantics but also state-of-the-art topic models that do not have the deep and convolutional architecture characterizing the DSSM.","One area of future work is to extend our method to model interestingness given an entire user session, which consists of a sequence of browsing events. We believe that the prior browsing and interaction history recorded in the session provides additional signals for predicting interestingness. To capture such signals, our model needs to be extended to adequately represent time series (e.g., causal relations and consequences of ac-tions). One potentially effective model for such a purpose is based on the architecture of recurrent neural networks (e.g., Mikolov et al. 2010; Chen and Deng, 2014), which can be incorporated into the deep semantic model proposed in this paper."]},{"title":"Additional Authors","paragraphs":["Yelong Shen (Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA, email: yeshen@microsoft.com)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors thank Johnson Apacible, Pradeep Chilakamarri, Edward Guo, Bernhard Kohlmeier, Xiaolong Li, Kevin Powell, Xinying Song and Ye-Yi Wang for their guidance and valuable discussions.
