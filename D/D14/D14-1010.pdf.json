For example, Xue (2003) proposes a four-label scheme based on some linguistic intuitions: ‘B’ for the beginning character of a word, ‘I’ for the internal characters, ‘E’ for the ending character, and ‘S’ for single-character word. Thus the word sequence “洽谈会 很 成功” can be turned into a character sequence with labels as 洽\\B 谈\\I 会\\E 很\\S 成\\B 功\\E. A machine learning algorithm for sequence labeling, such as conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), can be applied to the labelled training data to learn a model.","Labelled data for supervised learning of Chinese word segmentation, however, is usually expensive and tends to be of a limited amount. Researchers are thus interested in semi-supervised learning, which is to make use of unlabelled data to further improve the performance of supervised learning. There is a large amount of unlabelled data available, for example, the Gigaword corpus in the LDC catalog or the Chinese Wikipedia on the web.","Faced with the large amount of unlabelled data, an intuitive idea is to use self-training or EM, by first training a baseline model (from the supervised data) and then iteratively decoding the unlabelled data and updating the baseline model. Jiao et al. (2006) and Mann and McCallum (2007) further propose to minimize the entropy of the predicted label distribution on unlabeled data and use it as a regularization term in CRF (i.e. entropy regularization). Beyond these ideas, Liang (2005) and Sun and Xu (2011) experiment with deriv-ing a large set of statistical features such as mutual information and accessor variety from unlabelled data, and add them to supervised discriminative training. Zeng et al. (2013b) experiment with graph propagation to extract information from unlabelled data to regularize the CRF training. Yang and Vozila (2013), Zhang et al. (2013), and Zeng et al. (2013a) experiment with co-training for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation. All these approaches only leverage the distribution of the unlabelled data, yet do not make use of the knowledge that the unlabelled data might have integrated in.","There could be valuable information encoded within the unlabelled data that researchers can take advantage of. For example, punctuation creates natural word boundaries (Li and Sun, 2009): the character before a comma can only be labelled as either ‘S’ or ‘E’, while the character after a comma can only be labelled as ‘S’ or ‘B’. Furthermore, entity tags (HTML tags or Wikipedia tags) on the web, such as emphasis and cross reference, also provide rich information for word segmentation: they might define a word or at least 90 Figure 1: Sausage constraint (partial labels) from natural annotations and punctuation give word boundary information similar to punctuation. Jiang et al. (2013) refer to such structural information on the web as natural annotations, and propose that they encode knowledge for NLP. For Chinese word segmentation, natural annotations and punctuation create a sausage1","constraint for the possible labels, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the sentence “近年来,人工智能和机器学习迅 猛发展。”, the first character 近 can only be labelled with ‘S’ or ‘B’; and the characters 来 before the comma and 展 before the Chinese period can only be labelled as ‘S’ or ‘E’. “ 人工智能” and “机 器学习” are two Wikipedia entities, and so they define the word boundaries before the first character and after the last character of the entities as well. The single character 和 between these two entities has only one label ‘S’. This sausage constraint thus encodes rich information for word segmentation.","To make use of the knowledge encoded in the sausage constraint, Jiang et al. (2013) adopt a constrained decode approach. They first train a baseline model with labelled data, and then run constrained decode on the unlabelled data by binding the search space with the sausage; and so the decoded labels are consistent with the sausage constraint. The unlabelled data, together with the labels from constrained decode, are then selectively added to the labelled data for training the final model. This approach, using constrained decode as a middle step, provides an indirect way of leaning the knowledge. However, the middle step, constrained decode, has the risk of reinforc-ing the errors in the baseline model: the decoded labels added to the training data for building the final model might contain errors introduced from the baseline model. The knowledge encoded in 1 Also referred to as confusion network. the data carrying the information from punctuation and natural annotations is thus polluted by the errorful re-decoded labels.","A sentence where each character has exactly one label is fully-labelled; and a sentence where each character receives all possible labels is zero-labelled. A sentence with sausage-constrained labels can be viewed as partially-labelled. These partial labels carry valuable information that researchers would like to learn in a model, yet the normal CRF training typically uses fully-labelled sentences. Recently, Täckström et al. (2013) propose an approach to train a CRF model directly from partial labels. The basic idea is to marginalize the probability mass of the constrained sausage in the cost function. The normal CRF training using fully-labelled sentences is a special case where the sausage constraint is a linear line; while on the other hand a zero-labelled sentence, where the sausage constraint is the full lattice, makes no contribution in the learning since the sum of probabilities is deemed to be one. This new approach, without the need of using constrained re-decoding as a middle step, provides a direct means to learn the knowledge in the partial labels.","In this research we explore using the partial-label learning for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation. We use the CTB-6 corpus as the labelled training, development and test data, and use the Chinese Wikipedia as the unlabelled data. We first train a baseline model with labelled data only, and then selectively add Wikipedia data with partial labels to build a second model. Because the Wikipedia data is out of domain and has distribution bias, we also experiment with two domain adaptation techniques: model interpolation and EasyAdapt (Daumé III, 2007). Our result reaches an F-measure of 95.98%, an absolute improvement of 0.72% over the very strong base-91 line (corresponding to 15.19% relative error reduction), and 0.33% over the constrained decode approach (corresponding to 7.59% relative error reduction). We conduct a detailed error analysis, illustrating how partial-label learning excels constrained decode in learning the knowledge encoded in the Wikipedia data. As a note, our result also out-performs (Wang et al., 2011) and (Sun and Xu, 2011)."]},{"title":"2 Partial-Label Learning with CRF","paragraphs":["In this section, we review in more detail the partial-label learning algorithm with CRF proposed by (Täckström et al., 2013).

We follow the official CTB-6 guideline in splitting the corpus into a training set, a development set, and a test set. The training set has 23420 sentences; the development set has 2079 sentences; and the test set has 2796 sentences. These are fully-labelled data.","For unlabelled data we use the Chinese Wikipedia. The Wikipedia data is quite noisy and asks for a lot of cleaning. We first filter out references and lists etc., and sentences with obviously bad segmentations, for example, where every character is separated by a space. We also remove sentences that contain mostly English words. We then convert all characters into full-width. We also convert traditional Chinese characters into simplified characters using the tool 92 mediawiki-zhconverter 2",". We then randomly select 7737 sentences and reserve them as the test set.","To create the partial labels in the Wikipedia data, we use the information from cross-reference, emphasis, and punctuation. In our pilot study we found that it’s beneficial to force a cross-reference or emphasis entity as a word when the item has 2 or 3 characters. That is, if an entity in the Wikipedia has three characters it receives the labels of “BIE”; and if it has two characters it is labelled as “BE”.3 3.2 Supervised baseline model We create the baseline supervised model by using an order-1 linear CRF with L2 regularization, to label a character sequence with the four candidate labels “BIES”. We use the tool wapiti (Lavergne et al., 2010).","Following Sun et al. (2009), Sun (2010), and Low et al. (2005), we extract two types of features: character-level features and word-level features. Given a character c0 in the character sequence ...c−2c−1c0c1c2...: Character-level features : • Character unigrams: c−2, c−1, c0, c1, c2 • Character bigrams: c−2c−1, c−1c−0, c0c1, c1c2 • Consecutive character equivalence: ?c−2 = c−1, ?c−1 = c−0 , ?c0 = c1, ?c1 = c2 • Separated character equivalence: ?c−3 = c−1, ?c−2 = c0, ?c−1 = c1, ?c0 = c2, ?c1 = c3","• Whether the current character is a punctuation: ?Punct (c0) • Character sequence pattern: T (C−2)T (C−1)T (C0)T (C1)T (C2). We classify all characters into four types. Type one has three characters ‘ 年’ (year) ‘ 月’ (month) ‘ 日’ (date). Type two includes number characters. Type three includes English characters. All others are Type four characters. Thus “去年三月S” would generate the character sequence pattern “41213”. 2 https://github.com/tszming/mediawiki-zhconverter 3 Another possibility is to label it as “SS” but we find that","it’s very rare the case. Word-level features :","• The identity of the string c[s : i] (i−6 < s < i), if it matches a word from the list of word unigrams; multiple features could be generated.","• The identity of the string c[i : e] (i < e < i+6), if it matches a word; multiple features could be generated.","• The identity of the bi-gram c[s : i − 1]c[i : e] (i − 6 < s, e < i + 6), if it matches a word bigram; multiple features could be generated.","• The identity of the bi-gram c[s : i]c[i + 1 : e] (i − 6 < s, e < i + 6), if it matches a word bigram; multiple features could be generated.","• Idiom. We use the idiom list from (Sun and Xu, 2011). If the current character c0 and its surrounding context compose an idiom, we generate a feature for c0 of its position in the idiom. For example, if c−1c0c1c2 is an idiom, we generate feature “Idiom-2” for c0.","The above features together with label bigrams are fed to wapiti for training. The supervised baseline model is created with the CTB-6 corpus without the use of Wikipedia data. 3.3 Partial-label learning The overall process of applying partial-label learning to Wikipedia data is shown in Algorithm 1. Following (Jiang et al., 2013), we first train the supervised baseline model, and use it to estimate the potential contribution for each sentence in the Wikipedia training data. We label the sentence with the baseline model, and then compare the labels with the constrained sausage. For each character, a consistent label is defined as an element in the constrained labels. For example, if the constrained labels for a character are “SB”, the label ‘S’ or ‘B’ is consistent but ‘I’ or ‘E’ is not. The number of inconsistent labels for each sentence is then used as its potential contribution to the partial-label learning: higher number indicates that the partial-labels for the sentence contain more knowledge that the baseline system does not integrate, and so have higher potential contribution. The Wikipedia training sentences are then ranked by their potential contribution, and the top 93 Figure 2: Encoded knowledge: inconsistency ratio and label reduction K sentences together with their partial labels are then added to the CTB-6 training data to build a new model, using partial-label learning. 4","In our experiments, we try six data points with K = 100k, 200k, 300k, 400k, 500k, 600k. Figure 2 gives a rough idea of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia for these data points with inconsistency ratio and label reduction. Inconsistency ratio is the percentage of characters that have inconsistent labels; and label reduction is the percentage of the labels reduced in the full lattice.","We modify wapiti to implement the partial-label learning as described in Section 2.

Thus for fair comparison, we re-implement the constrained decode algorithm with CRF.","Algorithm 2 shows the constrained decode implementation. We first train the baseline model with the CTB-6 data. We then use this baseline model to run normal decode and constrained decode for each sentence in the Wikipedia training set. If the normal decode and constrained decode have different labels, we add the constrained decode together with the number of different labels to the filtered Wikipedia training corpus. The filtered Wikipedia training corpus is then sorted using the number of different labels, and the top K sentences with constrained decoded labels are then added to the CTB-6 training data for building a new model using normal CRF.

The Wikipedia test set, however, is only partially-labelled. Thus the metric we use here is consistent label accuracy, similar to how we rank the sentences in Section 3.3, defined as whether a predicted label for a character is an element in the constrained labels. Because partial labels are only sparsely distributed in the test data, a lot of characters receive all four labels in the constrained sausage. Evaluating against characters with all four labels do not really represent the models’ difference as it is deemed to be consistent. Thus beyond evaluating against all characters in the Wikipedia test set (referred to as Full measurement), we also evaluate against characters that are only constrained with less than four labels (referred to as Label measurement). The Label measurement focuses on en-94 coded knowledge in the test set and so can better represent the model’s capability of learning from the partial labels.","Results are shown in Figure 3 with the Full measurement and in Figure 4 with the Label measurement. The x axes are the size of Wikipedia training data, as explained in Section 3.3. As can be seen, both constrained decode and partial-label learning perform much better than the baseline supervised model that is trained from CTB-6 data only, indicating that both of them are learning the encoded knowledge from the Wikipedia training data. Also we see the trend that the performance improves with more data in training, also suggesting the learning of encoded knowledge. Most importantly, we see that partial-label learning consistently out-performs constrained decode in all data points. With the Label measurement, partial-label learning gives 1.7% or higher absolute improvement over constrained decode across all data points. At the data point of 600k, constrained decode gives an accuracy of 97.14%, while partial-label learning gives 98.93% (baseline model gives 87.08%). The relative gain (from learning the knowledge) of partial-label learning over constrained decode is thus 18% ((98.93 − 97.14)/(97.14 − 87.08)). These results suggest that partial-label learning is more effective in learning the encoded knowledge in the Wikipedia data than constrained decode."]},{"title":"5 CTB evaluation5.1 Model adaptation","paragraphs":["Our ultimate goal, however, is to determine whether we can leverage the encoded knowledge in the Wikipedia data to improve the word segmentation in CTB-6. We run our models against the CTB-6 test set, with results shown in Figure 5. Because we have fully-labelled sentences in the CTB-6 data, we adopt the F-measure as our evaluation metric here. The baseline model achieves 95.26% in F-measure, providing a state-of-the-art supervised performance. Constrained decode is able to improve on this already very strong baseline performance, and we see the nice trend of higher performance with more unlabeled data for training, indicating that constrained decode is making use of the encoded knowledge in the Wikipedia data to help CTB-6 segmentation.","When we look at the partial-label model, how-ever, the results tell a totally different story. Figure 3: Wiki label evaluation results: Full Figure 4: Wiki label evaluation results: Label Figure 5: CTB evaluation results 95 First, it actually performs worse than the baseline model, and the more data added to training, the worse the performance is. In the previous section we show that partial-label learning is more effective in learning the encoded knowledge in Wikipedia data than constrained decode. So, what goes wrong? We hypothesize that there is an out-of-domain distribution bias in the partial labels, and so the more data we add, the worse the in-domain performance is. Constrained decode actually helps to smooth out the out-of-domain distribution bias by using the re-decoded labels with the in-domain supervised baseline model. For example, both the baseline model and constrained decode correctly give the segmentation “提供/了/运输/和/给给给排排排水水水/之/便”, while partial-label learning gives incorrect segmentation “提 供/了/运 输/和/给给给/排排排 水水水/之/便”. Looking at the Wikipedia training data, 排水 is tagged as an entity 13 times; and 给 排 水, although occurs 13 times in the data, is never tagged as an entity. Partial-label learning, which focuses on the tagged entities, thus overrules the segmentation of 给排 水. Constrained decode, on the other hand, by using the correctly re-decoded labels from the baseline model, observes enough evidence to correctly segment 给排水 as a word.","To smooth out the out-of-domain distribution bias, we experiment with two approaches: model interpolation and EasyAdapt (Daumé III, 2007). 5.1.1 Model interpolation We linearly interpolate the model of partial-label learning M pl","with the baseline model M0 to create the final model M pl","+ , as shown in Equation 7. The interpolation weight is optimized via a grid search between 0.0 and 1.0 with a step of 0.1, tuned on the CTB-6 development set. Again we modify wapiti so that it takes two models and an interpolation weight as input. For each model it creates a search lattice with posteriors, and then linearly combines the two lattices using the interpolation weight to create the final search space for decoding. As shown in Figure 5, model M pl","+ consistently out-performs constrained decode in all data points. We also see the trend of better performance with more training data.","M pl + = λ ∗ M0 + (1 − λ) ∗ M pl (7) 5.1.2 EasyAdapt EasyAdapt is a straightforward technique but has been shown effective in many domain adaptation tasks (Daumé III, 2007). We train the model M pl","ea with feature augmentation. For each out-of-domain training instance < xo, yo >, where xo is the input features and yo is the (partial) labels, we copy the features and file them as an additional feature set, and so the training instance becomes < xo, xo, yo >. The in-domain training data remains the same. Consistent with (Daumé III, 2007), EasyAdapt gives us the best performance, as show in Figure 5. Furthermore, unlike in (Jiang et al., 2013) where they find a plateau, our results show no harm adding more training data for partial-label learning when integrated with domain adaptation, although the performance seems to saturate after 400k sentences.","Finally, we search for the parameter setting of best performance on the CTB-6 development set, which is to use EasyAdapt with K = 600k sentences of Wikipedia data. With this setting, the performance on the CTB-6 test set is 95.98% in F-measure. This is 0.72% absolute improvement over supervised baseline (corresponding to 15.19% relative error reduction), and 0.33% absolute improvement over constrained decode (corresponding to 7.59% relative error reduction); the differences are both statistically significant (p < 0.001).5","As a note, this result out-performs (Sun and Xu, 2011) (95.44%) and (Wang et al., 2011) (95.79%), and the differences are also statistically significant (p < 0.001). 5.2 Analysis with examples To better understand why partial-label learning is more effective in learning the encoded knowledge, we look at cases where M0 and M cd","have the incorrect segmentation while M pl","(and its domain adaptation variance M pl","+ and M pl","ea) have the correct segmentation. We find that the majority is due to the error in re-decoded labels outside of encoded knowledge. For example, M0 and M cd","give the segmentation “地震/为/里里里/氏氏氏/6.9/ 级”, yet the correct segmentation given by partial-label learning is “地 震/为/里里里 氏氏氏/6.9/ 级”. Looking at the Wikipedia training data, there are 38 tagged entities of 里氏, but there are another 190 mentions of 5 Statistical significance is evaluated with z-test using the","standard deviation of √","F ∗ (1 − F )/N, where F is the F-","measure and N is the number of words. 96 里氏 that are not tagged as an entity. Thus for constrained decode it sees 38 cases of “里\\B 氏\\E” and 190 cases of “里\\S 氏\\S” in the Wikipedia training data. The former comes from the encoded knowledge while the latter comes from re-decoded labels by the baseline model. The much bigger number of incorrect labels from the baseline re-decoding badly pollute the encoded knowledge. This example illustrates that constrained decode reinforces the errors from the baseline. On the other hand, the training materials for partial-label learning are purely the encoded knowledge, which is not impacted by the baseline model error. In this example, partial-label learning focuses only on the 38 cases of “里\\B 氏\\E” and so is able to learn that 里氏 is a word.","As a final remark, we want to make a point that, although the re-decoded labels serve to smooth out the distribution bias, the Wikipedia data is indeed not the ideal data set for such a purpose, because it itself is out of domain. The performance tends to degrade when we apply the baseline model to re-decode the out-of-domain Wikipedia data. The errorful re-decoded labels, when being used to train the model M cd",", could lead to further errors. For example, the baseline model M0 is able to give the correct segmentation “电脑/元元元器器器件件件” in the CTB-6 test set. However, when it is applied to the Wikipedia data for constrained decode, for the seven occurrences of 元器件, three of which are correctly labelled as “元\\B 器\\I 件\\E”, but the other four have incorrect labels. The final model M cd","trained from these labels then gives incorrect segmentation “两/市/生 产/的/电 脑/元元元/器器器件件件/大量/销往/世界/各地” in the CTB-6 test set. On the other hand, model interpolation or EasyAdapt with partial-label learning, focusing only on the encoded knowledge and not being impacted by the errorful re-decoded labels, performs correctly in this case. For a more fair comparison between partial-label learning and constrained decode, we have also plotted the results of model interpolation and EasyAdapt for constrained decode in Figure 5. As can be seen, they improve on constrained decode a bit but still fall behind the correspondent domain adaptation approach of partial-label learning."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and future work","paragraphs":["There is rich information encoded in online web data. For example, punctuation and entity tags define some word boundaries. In this paper we show the effectiveness of partial-label learning in digest-ing the encoded knowledge from Wikipedia data for the task of Chinese word segmentation. Unlike approaches such as constrained decode that use the errorful re-decoded labels, partial-label learning provides a direct means to learn the encoded knowledge. By integrating some domain adaptation techniques such as EasyAdapt, we achieve an F-measure of 95.98% in the CTB-6 corpus, a significant improvement from both the supervised baseline and constrained decode. Our results also beat (Wang et al., 2011) and (Sun and Xu, 2011).","In this research we employ a sausage constraint to encode the knowledge for Chinese word segmentation. However, a sausage constraint does not reflect the legal label sequence. For example, in Figure 1 the links between label ‘B’ and label ‘S’, between ‘S’ and ‘E’, and between ‘E’ and ‘I’ are illegal, and can confuse the machine learning. In our current work we solve this issue by adding some fully-labelled data into training. Instead we can easily extend our work to use a lattice constraint by removing the illegal transitions from the sausage. The partial-label learning stands the same, by executing the forward-backward process in the constrained lattice. In future work we will examine partial-label learning with this more enforced lattice constraint in depth."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Wenbin Jiang, Xiaodong Zeng, and Weiwei Sun for helpful discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for insightful comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Hal Daumé III. 2007.
