This was only possible because of the use of automatic metrics for MT evaluation, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which is the defacto standard; and more recently: TER (Snover et al., 2006) and METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), among other emerging MT evaluation metrics. These automatic metrics provide fast and in-expensive means to compare the output of different MT systems, without the need to ask for human judgments each time the MT system has been changed.","As a result, this has enabled rapid development in the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), by allowing to train and tune systems as well as to track progress in a way that highly correlates with human judgments.","Today, MT evaluation is an active field of research, and modern metrics perform analysis at various levels, e.g., lexical (Papineni et al., 2002; Snover et al., 2006), including synonymy and paraphrasing (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009); syntactic (Giménez and Màrquez, 2007; Popović and Ney, 2007; Liu and Gildea, 2005); semantic (Giménez and Màrquez, 2007; Lo et al., 2012); and discourse (Comelles et al., 2010; Wong and Kit, 2012; Guzmán et al., 2014; Joty et al., 2014).","Automatic MT evaluation metrics compare the output of a system to one or more human references in order to produce a similarity score. The quality of such a metric is typically judged in terms of correlation of the scores it produces with scores given by human judges. As a result, some evaluation metrics have been trained to re-produce the scores assigned by humans as closely as possible (Albrecht and Hwa, 2008). Unfortunately, humans have a hard time assigning an absolute score to a translation. Hence, direct human evaluation scores such as adequacy and fluency, which were widely used in the past, are now discontinued in favor of ranking-based evaluations, where judges are asked to rank the output of 2 to 5 systems instead. It has been shown that using such ranking-based assessments yields much higher inter-annotator agreement (Callison-Burch et al., 2007).","While evaluation metrics still produce numerical scores, in part because MT evaluation shared tasks at NIST and WMT ask for it, there has also been work on a ranking formulation of the MT evaluation task for a given set of outputs. This was shown to yield higher correlation with human judgments (Duh, 2008; Song and Cohn, 2011). 214","Learning automatic metrics in a pairwise setting, i.e., learning to distinguish between two alternative translations and to decide which of the two is better (which is arguably one of the easiest ways to produce a ranking), emulates closely how human judges perform evaluation assessments in reality. Instead of learning a similarity function between a translation and the reference, they learn how to differentiate a better from a worse translation given a corresponding reference. While the pairwise setting does not provide an absolute quality scoring metric, it is useful for most evaluation and MT development scenarios.","In this paper, we propose a pairwise learning setting similar to that of Duh (2008), but we extend it to a new level, both in terms of feature representation and learning framework. First, we integrate several layers of linguistic information encapsulated in tree-based structures; Duh (2008) only used lexical and POS matches as features. Second, we use information about both the reference and two alternative translations simultaneously, thus bringing our ranking closer to how humans rank translations. Finally, instead of deciding upfront which types of features between hypotheses and references are important, we use a our structural kernel learning (SKL) framework to generate and select them automatically.","The structural kernel learning (SKL) framework we propose consists in: (i) designing a structural representation, e.g., using syntactic and discourse trees of translation hypotheses and a references; and (ii) applying structural kernels (Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti, 2008), to such representa-tions in order to automatically inject structural features in the preference re-ranking algorithm. We use this method with translation-reference pairs to directly learn the features themselves, instead of learning the importance of a predetermined set of features. A similar learning framework has been proven to be effective for question answering (Moschitti et al., 2007), and textual entailment recognition (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006).","Our goals are twofold: (i) in the short term, to demonstrate that structural kernel learning is suitable for this task, and can effectively learn to rank hypotheses at the segment-level; and (ii) in the long term, to show that this approach provides a unified framework that allows to integrate several layers of linguistic analysis and information and to improve over the state-of-the-art.","Below we report the results of some initial experiments using syntactic and discourse structures. We show that learning in the proposed framework yields better correlation with humans than applying the traditional translation–reference similarity metrics using the same type of structures. We also show that the contributions of syntax and discourse information are cumulative. Finally, despite the limited information we use, we achieve correlation at the segment level that outperforms BLEU and other metrics at WMT12, e.g., our metric would have been ranked higher in terms of correlation with human judgments compared to TER, NIST, and BLEU in the WMT12 Metrics shared task (Callison-Burch et al., 2012)."]},{"title":"2 Kernel-based Learning from LinguisticStructures","paragraphs":["In our pairwise setting, each sentence s in the source language is represented by a tuple ⟨t1, t2, r⟩, where t1 and t2 are two alternative translations and r is a reference translation. Our goal is to develop a classifier of such tuples that decides whether t1 is a better translation than t2 given the reference r.","Engineering features for deciding whether t1 is a better translation than t2 is a difficult task. Thus, we rely on the automatic feature extraction enabled by the SKL framework, and our task is reduced to choosing: (i) a meaningful structural representation for ⟨t1, t2, r⟩, and (ii) a feature function φmt that maps such structures to substructures, i.e., our feature space. Since the design of φmt is complex, we use tree kernels applied to two simpler structural mappings φM (t1, r) and φM (t2, r). The latter generate the tree representa-tions for the translation-reference pairs (t1, r) and (t2, r). The next section shows such mappings. 2.1 Representations To represent a translation-reference pair (t, r), we adopt shallow syntactic trees combined with RSTstyle discourse trees. Shallow trees have been successfully used for question answering (Severyn and Moschitti, 2012) and semantic textual similarity (Severyn et al., 2013b); while discourse information has proved useful in MT evaluation (Guzmán et al., 2014; Joty et al., 2014). Combined shallow syntax and discourse trees worked well for concept segmentation and labeling (Saleh et al., 2014a). 215 DIS:ELABORATION EDU:NUCLEUS EDU:SATELLITE-REL VP NP-REL NP VP-REL o-REL o-REL RB TO-REL VB-REL PRP-REL DT NN-REL TO-REL VB-REL .-REL ''-REL not to give them the time to think . \" VP NP-REL NP VP-REL o-REL o-REL TO-REL `̀ VB-REL PRP-REL DT NN-REL TO-REL VB-REL .-REL ''-REL to \" give them no time to think . \" a) Hypothesis b) Reference DIS:ELABORATION EDU:NUCLEUS EDU:SATELLITE-REL Bag-of-words relations re l at ion  p rop ag ation  dir e c tion Figure 1: Hypothesis and reference trees combining discourse, shallow syntax and POS.","Figure 1 shows two example trees combining discourse, shallow syntax and POS: one for a translation hypothesis (top) and the other one for the reference (bottom). To build such structures, we used the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), the Illinois chunker (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), and the discourse parser1","of (Joty et al., 2012; Joty et al., 2013).","The lexical items constitute the leaves of the tree. The words are connected to their respec-tive POS tags, which are in turn grouped into chunks. Then, the chunks are grouped into elementary discourse units (EDU), to which the nuclearity status is attached (i.e., NUCLEUS or SATELLITE). Finally, EDUs and higher-order discourse units are connected by discourse relations (e.g., DIS:ELABORATION). 2.2 Kernels-based modeling In the SKL framework, the learning objects are pairs of translations ⟨t1, t2⟩. Our objective is to automatically learn which pair features are important, independently of the source sentence. We achieve this by using kernel machines (KMs) over two learning objects ⟨t1, t2⟩, ⟨t′","1, t′","2⟩, along with an explicit and structural representation of the pairs (see Fig. 1). 1 The discourse parser can be downloaded from","http://alt.qcri.org/tools/","More specifically, KMs carry out learning using the scalar product","Kmt(⟨t1, t2⟩, ⟨t′","1, t′ 2⟩) = φmt(t1, t2) · φmt(t′","1, t′","2), where φmt maps pairs into the feature space.","Considering that our task is to decide whether t1 is better than t2, we can conveniently represent the vector for the pair in terms of the difference between the two translation vectors, i.e., φmt(t1, t2) = φK (t1) − φK (t2). We can approximate Kmt with a preference kernel P K to compute this difference in the kernel space K:","P K(⟨t1, t2⟩, ⟨t′ 1, t′","2⟩) (1)","= K(t1) − φK (t2)) · (φK (t′ 1) − φK (t′","2))","= K(t1, t′","1) + K(t2, t′ 2) − K(t1, t′","2) − K(t2, t′","1) The advantage of this is that now K(ti, t′","j) = φK (ti) · φK (t′","j) is defined between two translations only, and not between two pairs of translations. This simplification enables us to map translations into simple trees, e.g., those in Figure 1, and then to apply them tree kernels, e.g., the Partial Tree Kernel (Moschitti, 2006), which carry out a scalar product in the subtree space.","We can further enrich the representation φK , if we consider all the information available to the human judges when they are ranking translations. That is, the two alternative translations along with their corresponding reference. 216","In particular, let r and r′","be the references for","the pairs ⟨t1, t2⟩ and ⟨t′ 1, t′","2⟩, we can redefine all","the members of Eq. 1, e.g., K(t1, t′","1) becomes","K(⟨t1, r⟩, ⟨t′","1, r′","⟩) = PTK(φM (t1, r), φM (t′","1, r′","))","+ PTK(φM (r, t1), φM (r′",", t′","1)), where φM maps a pair of texts to a single tree.","There are several options to produce the bitext-to-tree mapping for φM . A simple approach is to only use the tree corresponding to the first argument of φM . This leads to the basic model K(⟨t1, r⟩, ⟨t′","1, r′","⟩) = PTK(φM (t1), φM (t′","1)) + PTK(φM (r), φM (r′",")), i.e., the sum of two tree kernels applied to the trees constructed by φM (we previously informally mentioned it).","However, this simple mapping may be ineffec-tive since the trees within a pair, e.g., (t1, r), are treated independently, and no meaningful features connecting t1 and r can be derived from their tree fragments. Therefore, we model φM (r, t1) by using word-matching relations between t1 and r, such that connections between words and constituents of the two trees are established using position-independent word matching. For example, in Figure 1, the thin dashed arrows show the links connecting the matching words between t1 and r. The propagation of these relations works from the bottom up. Thus, if all children in a constituent have a link, their parent is also linked.","The use of such connections is essential as it enables the comparison of the structural properties and relations between two translation-reference pairs. For example, the tree fragment [ELABORA-TION [SATELLITE]] from the translation is connected to [ELABORATION [SATELLITE]] in the reference, indicating a link between two entire discourse units (drawn with a thicker arrow), and providing some reliability to the translation2",".","Note that the use of connections yields a graph representation instead of a tree. This is problematic as effective models for graph kernels, which would be a natural fit to this problem, are not currently available for exploiting linguistic information. Thus, we simply use K, as defined above, where the mapping φM (t1, r) only produces a tree for t1 annotated with the marker REL represent-ing the connections to r. This marker is placed on all node labels of the tree generated from t1 that match labels from the tree generated from r. 2","Note that a non-pairwise model, i.e., K(t1, r), could also be used to match the structural information above, but it would not learn to compare it to a second pair (t2, r).","In other words, we only consider the trees enriched by markers separately, and ignore the edges connecting both trees."]},{"title":"3 Experiments and Discussion","paragraphs":["We experimented with datasets of segment-level human rankings of system outputs from the WMT11 and the WMT12 Metrics shared tasks (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2012): we used the WMT11 dataset for training and the WMT12 dataset for testing. We focused on translating into English only, for which the datasets can be split by source language: Czech (cs), German (de), Spanish (es), and French (fr). There were about 10,000 non-tied human judgments per language pair per dataset. We scored our pairwise system predictions with respect to the WMT12 human judgments using the Kendall’s Tau (τ ), which was official at WMT12.","Table 1 presents the τ scores for all metric variants introduced in this paper: for the individual language pairs and overall. The left-hand side of the table shows the results when using as similarity the direct kernel calculation between the corresponding structures of the candidate translation and the reference3",", e.g., as in (Guzmán et al., 2014; Joty et al., 2014). The right-hand side contains the results for structured kernel learning.","We can make the following observations: (i) The overall results for all SKL-trained metrics are higher than the ones when applying direct similarity, showing that learning tree structures is better than just calculating similarity. (ii) Regarding the linguistic representation, we see that, when learning tree structures, syntactic and discourse-based trees yield similar improvements with a slight advantage for the former. More in-terestingly, when both structures are put together in a combined tree, the improvement is cumula-tive and yields the best results by a sizable margin. This provides positive evidence towards our goal of a unified tree-based representation with multiple layers of linguistic information. (iii) Comparing to the best evaluation metrics that participated in the WMT12 Metrics shared task, we find that our approach is competitive and would have been ranked among the top 3 participants.","3","Applying tree kernels between the members of a pair to generate one feature (for each different kernel function) has become a standard practice in text similarity tasks (Severyn et al., 2013b) and in question answering (Severyn et al., 2013a). 217 Similarity Structured Kernel Learning Structure cs-en de-en es-en fr-en all cs-en de-en es-en fr-en all 1 SYN 0.169 0.188 0.203 0.222 0.195 0.190 0.244 0.198 0.158 0.198 2 DIS 0.130 0.174 0.188 0.169 0.165 0.176 0.235 0.166 0.160 0.184 3 DIS+POS 0.135 0.186 0.190 0.178 0.172 0.167 0.232 0.202 0.133 0.183 4 DIS+SYN 0.156 0.205 0.206 0.203 0.192 0.210 0.251 0.240 0.223 0.231 Table 1: Kendall’s (τ ) correlation with human judgements on WMT12 for each language pair.","Furthermore, our result (0.237) is ahead of the correlation obtained by popular metrics such as TER (0.217), NIST (0.214) and BLEU (0.185) at WMT12.

Table 2 shows cross-language evaluation results for DIS+SYN: lines 1-4 show results when training on WMT11 for one language pair, and then testing for each language pair of WMT12.","We can see that the overall differences in performance (see the last column: all) when training on different source languages are rather small, rang-ing from 0.209 to 0.221, which suggests that our approach is quite independent of the source language used for training.

We have integrated several layers of linguistic information (lexical, syntactic and discourse) in tree-based structures, and we have used the structured kernel learning to identify relevant features and learn pairwise rankers.","The evaluation results have shown that learning in the proposed SKL framework is possible, yield-ing better correlation (Kendall’s τ ) with human judgments than computing the direct kernel similarity between translation and reference, over the same type of structures. We have also shown that the contributions of syntax and discourse information are cumulative, indicating that this learning framework can be appropriate for the combination of different sources of information. Finally, despite the limited information we used, we achieved better correlation at the segment level than BLEU and other metrics in the WMT12 Metrics task.","In the future, we plan to work towards our longterm goal, i.e., including more linguistic information in the SKL framework and showing that this can help. This would also include more semantic information, e.g., in the form of Brown clusters or using semantic similarity between the words composing the structure calculated with latent semantic analysis (Saleh et al., 2014b).","We further want to show that the proposed framework is flexible and can include information in the form of quality scores predicted by other evaluation metrics, for which a vector of features would be combined with the structured kernel."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research is part of the Interactive sYstems for Answer Search (Iyas) project, conducted by the Arabic Language Technologies (ALT) group at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) within the Qatar Foundation. 218"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Joshua Albrecht and Rebecca Hwa. 2008.
