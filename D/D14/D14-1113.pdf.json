Nearly all this work, however, assumes a single vector per word type—ignoring polysemy and thus jeopardizing their useful-ness for downstream tasks. We present an extension to the Skip-gram model that efficiently learns multiple embeddings per word type. It differs from recent related work by jointly performing word sense discrimination and embedding learning, by non-parametrically estimating the number of senses per word type, and by its efficiency and scalability. We present new state-of-the-art results in the word similarity in context task and demonstrate its scalability by training with one machine on a corpus of nearly 1 billion tokens in less than 6 hours."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Representing words by dense, real-valued vector embeddings, also commonly called “distributed representations,” helps address the curse of dimensionality and improve generalization because they can place near each other words having similar semantic and syntactic roles. This has been shown dramatically in state-of-the-art results on language modeling (Bengio et al, 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2007) as well as improvements in other natural language processing tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al, 2010). Substantial benefit arises when embeddings can be trained on large volumes of data. Hence the recent consider-able interest in the CBOW and Skip-gram models * The first two authors contributed equally to this paper. of Mikolov et al (2013a); Mikolov et al (2013b)— relatively simple log-linear models that can be trained to produce high-quality word embeddings on the entirety of English Wikipedia text in less than half a day on one machine.","There is rising enthusiasm for applying these models to improve accuracy in natural language processing, much like Brown clusters (Brown et al, 1992) have become common input features for many tasks, such as named entity extraction (Miller et al, 2004; Ratinov and Roth, 2009) and parsing (Koo et al, 2008; Täckström et al, 2012). In comparison to Brown clusters, the vector embeddings have the advantages of substantially better scalability in their training, and intriguing potential for their continuous and multi-dimensional interrelations. In fact, Passos et al (2014) present new state-of-the-art results in CoNLL 2003 named entity extraction by directly inputting continuous vector embeddings obtained by a version of Skip-gram that injects supervision with lexicons. Similarly Bansal et al (2014) show results in dependency parsing using Skip-gram embeddings. They have also recently been applied to machine translation (Zou et al, 2013; Mikolov et al, 2013c).","A notable deficiency in this prior work is that each word type (e.g. the word string plant) has only one vector representation—polysemy and hononymy are ignored. This results in the word plant having an embedding that is approximately the average of its different contextual semantics relating to biology, placement, manufactur-ing and power generation. In moderately high-dimensional spaces a vector can be relatively “close” to multiple regions at a time, but this does not negate the unfortunate influence of the triangle inequality2","here: words that are not synonyms but are synonymous with different senses of the same word will be pulled together. For example, pollen and refinery will be inappropriately pulled to a dis-","2","For distance d, d(a, c) ≤ d(a, b) + d(b, c). 1059 tance not more than the sum of the distances plant– pollen and plant–refinery. Fitting the constraints of legitimate continuous gradations of semantics are challenge enough without the additional encumbrance of these illegitimate triangle inequalities.","Discovering embeddings for multiple senses per word type is the focus of work by Reisinger and Mooney (2010a) and Huang et al (2012). They both pre-cluster the contexts of a word type’s tokens into discriminated senses, use the clusters to re-label the corpus’ tokens according to sense, and then learn embeddings for these re-labeled words. The second paper improves upon the first by employing an earlier pass of non-discriminated embedding learning to obtain vectors used to represent the contexts. Note that by pre-clustering, these methods lose the opportunity to jointly learn the sense-discriminated vectors and the clustering. Other weaknesses include their fixed number of sense per word type, and the computational expense of the two-step process—the Huang et al (2012) method took one week of computation to learn multiple embeddings for a 6,000 subset of the 30,000 vocabulary on a corpus containing close to billion tokens.3","This paper presents a new method for learning vector-space embeddings for multiple senses per word type, designed to provide several advantages over previous approaches. (1) Sense-discriminated vectors are learned jointly with the assignment of token contexts to senses; thus we can use the emerging sense representation to more accurately perform the clustering. (2) A non-parametric variant of our method automatically discovers a varying number of senses per word type. (3) Efficient online joint training makes it fast and scalable. We refer to our method as Multiple-sense Skip-gram, or MSSG, and its non-parametric counterpart as NP-MSSG.","Our method builds on the Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al, 2013a), but maintains multiple vectors per word type. During online training with a particular token, we use the average of its context words’ vectors to select the token’s sense that is closest, and perform a gradient update on that sense. In the non-parametric version of our method, we build on facility location (Meyerson, 2001): a new cluster is created with probability proportional to the distance from the context to the 3 Personal communication with authors Eric H.

We show qualitative improvements over single-sense Skip-gram and Huang et al (2012), comparing against word neighbors from our parametric and non-parametric methods. We present quantitative results in three tasks. On both the SCWS and WordSim353 data sets our methods surpass the previous state-of-the-art. The Google Analogy task is not especially well-suited for word-sense evaluation since its lack of context makes selecting the sense difficult; however our method dramatically outperforms Huang et al (2012) on this task. Finally we also demonstrate scalabilty, learning multiple senses, training on nearly a billion tokens in less than 6 hours—a 27x improvement on Huang et al."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Much prior work has focused on learning vector representations of words; here we will describe only those most relevant to understanding this paper. Our work is based on neural language models, proposed by Bengio et al (2003), which extend the traditional idea of n-gram language models by replacing the conditional probability table with a neural network, representing each word token by a small vector instead of an indicator variable, and estimating the parameters of the neural network and these vectors jointly. Since the Bengio et al (2003) model is quite expensive to train, much re-search has focused on optimizing it. Collobert and Weston (2008) replaces the max-likelihood character of the model with a max-margin approach, where the network is encouraged to score the correct n-grams higher than randomly chosen incorrect n-grams. Mnih and Hinton (2007) replaces the global normalization of the Bengio model with a tree-structured probability distribution, and also considers multiple positions for each word in the tree.","More relevantly, Mikolov et al (2013a) and Mikolov et al (2013b) propose extremely computationally efficient log-linear neural language models by removing the hidden layers of the neural networks and training from larger context windows with very aggressive subsampling. The goal of the models in Mikolov et al (2013a) and Mikolov et al (2013b) is not so much obtain-ing a low-perplexity language model as learning word representations which will be useful in 1060 downstream tasks. Neural networks or log-linear models also do not appear to be necessary to learn high-quality word embeddings, as Dhillon and Ungar (2011) estimate word vector representations using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).","Word vector representations or embeddings have been used in various NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (Neelakantan and Collins, 2014; Passos et al, 2014; Turian et al, 2010), dependency parsing (Bansal et al, 2014), chunking (Turian et al, 2010; Dhillon and Ungar, 2011), sentiment analysis (Maas et al, 2011), paraphrase detection (Socher et al, 2011) and learning representations of paragraphs and documents (Le and Mikolov, 2014). The word clusters obtained from Brown clustering (Brown et al, 1992) have similarly been used as features in named entity recognition (Miller et al, 2004; Ratinov and Roth, 2009) and dependency parsing (Koo et al, 2008), among other tasks.","There is considerably less prior work on learning multiple vector representations for the same word type. Reisinger and Mooney (2010a) introduce a method for constructing multiple sparse, high-dimensional vector representations of words. Huang et al (2012) extends this approach incorporating global document context to learn multiple dense, low-dimensional embeddings by using recursive neural networks. Both the methods perform word sense discrimination as a preprocessing step by clustering contexts for each word type, making training more expensive. While methods such as those described in Dhillon and Ungar (2011) and Reddy et al (2011) use token-specific representations of words as part of the learning algorithm, the final outputs are still one-to-one mappings between word types and word embeddings."]},{"title":"3 Background: Skip-gram model","paragraphs":["The Skip-gram model learns word embeddings such that they are useful in predicting the surrounding words in a sentence.

Figure 3: The plot shows the distribution of number of senses learned per word type in NP-MSSG model given with their context, our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on SCWS as shown in the Table-4. The previous state-of-art model (Huang et al, 2012) on this task achieves 65.7% using the avgSimC measure, while the MSSG model achieves the best score of 69.3% on this task. The results on the other metrics are similar. For a fixed embedding dimension, the model by Huang et al (2012) has more parameters than our model since it uses a hidden layer. The results show that our model performs better than Huang et al (2012) even when both the models use 50 dimensional vectors and the performance of our model improves as we increase the number of dimensions to 300.","We evaluate the models in a word analogy task 1066 (a) (b) Figure 4: Figures (a) and (b) show the effect of varying embedding dimensionality and number of senses respectively of the MSSG Model on the SCWS task.

Multiple Embeddings are learned for top 30,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary. The embedding dimension size is 300 for all the models for this task. The number of senses for MSSG model is 3. introduced by Mikolov et al (2013a) where both MSSG and NP-MSSG models achieve 64% accuracy compared to 12% accuracy by Huang et al (2012). Skip-gram which is the state-of-art model for this task achieves 67% accuracy.","Figure 3 shows the distribution of number of senses learned per word type in the NP-MSSG model. We learn the multiple embeddings for the same set of approximately 6000 words that were used in Huang et al (2012) for all our experiments to ensure fair comparision. These approximately 6000 words were choosen by Huang et al. mainly from the top 30,00 frequent words in the vocabulary. This selection was likely made to avoid the noise of learning multiple senses for infrequent words. However, our method is robust to noise, which can be seen by the good performance of our model that learns multiple embeddings for the top 30,000 most frequent words. We found that even by learning multiple embeddings for the top 30,000 most frequent words in the vocubulary, MSSG model still achieves state-of-art result on SCWS task with an avgSimC score of 69.2 as shown in Table 6."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We present an extension to the Skip-gram model that efficiently learns multiple embeddings per word type. The model jointly performs word sense discrimination and embedding learning, and non-parametrically estimates the number of senses per word type. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results in the word similarity in context task and learns multiple senses, training on close to billion tokens in less than 6 hours. The global vectors, sense vectors and cluster centers of our model and code for learning them are avail-able at https://people.cs.umass.edu/ ãrvind/emnlp2014wordvectors. In future work we plan to use the multiple embeddings per word type in downstream NLP tasks. 1067"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval and in part by DARPA under agreement number FA8750-13-2-0020.
