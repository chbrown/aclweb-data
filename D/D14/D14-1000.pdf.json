The EMNLP conference series is annually organized by SIGDAT, the Association for Computational Linguistics’ special interest group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP. This year the conference is being held from October 25, 2014 (Sat.) to October 29, 2014 (Wed.) in Doha, Qatar. In the past five years, the EMNLP conference attendance has been continuously growing, reaching just over 500 paying attendees in 2013, and it is nowadays considered as one of the leading conferences in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. Given the growing trend, we believed it was the right time to lead EMNLP into an organization structure typical of large and important conferences. Therefore, we proposed several novelties: first of all, a large organization committee consisting of twenty (plus twenty-six area chairs) well-known members of the ACL community, who carried out several tasks required by the new achieved scale. Secondly, as this is the first conference edition spanning five days, in addition to six workshops, we also selected and included for the first time an excellent selection of eight tutorials. We defined a registration policy that allows the participants to attend any of the tutorials and workshops (held on October 25th and 29th) by just paying a low flat rate on top of the registration fee for the main conference. We believe this can greatly increase the spread of advanced technology and promote a unified view of the techniques and foundations of our research field. Thirdly, as a standalone conference, EMNLP required the definition of new administrative procedures and policies, regarding sponsorship booklets, double submission, scholarship assignment, and the joint EACL-ACL-EMNLP call for workshop proposals. Next, EMNLP is finding new ways to foster the dissemination of research work by facing the increasing number of papers to be presented at the conference. Our new approach consisted in presenting posters in nine sessions each proposing a small numbers of papers: this way poster presentations can receive the space and consideration that they deserve. Then, we are adding a surprise in terms of paper presentation and dissemination, which will be unveiled only few days before the start of the conference. Finally, this is the first time that an ACL conference is largely supported by a government research foundation. The Qatar National Research Foundation (QNRF) has included EMNLP 2014 as one of its local funding events. This enabled EMNLP and SIGDAT to perform unprecedented student scholarship support: more than 30 students were sponsored (partially or entirely) for participating in the conference. The obtained funds also allowed for offering a social dinner free of charge to all the attendees and still closing the conference budget in active, thus creating additional resources that SIGDAT can use to support the upcoming conferences. The novelties above as well as the traditional activities that the EMNLP conference series proposes to its members could not have been organized without the work of our large committee. In this respect, I would like to thank our PC co-chairs Walter Daelemans and Bo Pang, who greatly used their large experience with program committees of our community for selecting an excellent program. Special thanks go to our publication chair Yuval Marton, who did a terrific job in organizing and preparing the proceedings. As a side effect of his proactive action, workshop organizers and future publication chairs using the SoftConf START/ACLPUB systems can now streamline the inclusion of workshops and conference schedules in the proceedings, without heavy manual customization. We are very grateful to Enrique Alfonseca and Eric Gaussier for selecting interesting and successful iii workshops and to Lucia Specia and Xavier Carreras, who, for the first time, carried out the new task of selecting tutorials for an EMNLP conference. The workshops and tutorials nicely filled the additional two days of EMNLP, making our conference even more valuable. Many thanks are due to Katrin Erk and Sebastian Padó, who were challenged by the new activity (for EMNLP) of defining policy for the selection and assignment of participation scholarships to the most deserving students. The uncertainty over the final amount of funds and their diverse nature made this task particularly difficult. Nevertheless, they were able to find appropriate and successful solutions. As any large conference, we could count on the help of publicity co-chairs to advertise the old and new EMNLP features. We give our gratitude to Mona Diab and Irina Matveeva for their professional work. Fund hunting is a very important activity for conferences, in this respect, I would like to thank our sponsorship co-chairs, Jochen Leidner, Veselin Stoyanov and Min Zhang, for helping us to look for sponsors in three different continents. Regarding the SIGDAT side, a special thank is devoted to Noah Smith, who promptly answered any question I came out with. I am also grateful to the other SIGDAT officers (past and new): Eugene Charniak, Mark Johnson, Philipp Koehn, Mark Steedman, who were always there to give suggestions and solutions to critical issues that inevitably arise in any large event. Many thanks also to Tim Baldwin, Anna Korhonen, Graeme Hirst and David Yarowsky who provided much useful information from past conferences. Last but not least, I would like to thank Priscilla Rasmussen for her help and advice, and her undoubtful qualities of soothsayer regarding the estimation of conference numbers. Coming back to the sponsor topic, we are enormously thankful to QNRF, for accepting our proposal to fund EMNLP: this has made it possible to sponsor an unprecedented number of students and offer a banquet free of charge to all participants (we needed to create a new level of sponsorship for them, namely, Diamond). We are very grateful to The Qatar Computing Research Institute, which in addition to providing the very valuable Platinum sponsorship, also provided the required man power for organizing the event. In particular, EMNLP could not be organized in Qatar without the work of Kareem Darwish, the local organization chair. We are also very grateful to Kemal Oflazer, local co-chair and Francisco Guzman Herrera, local sponsorship chair, whose work was determinant to obtain the QNRF sponsorship. We are deeply in debt with the other local organizers, Lluís Màrquez, who also edited the conference booklet, Preslav Nakov, Fabrizio Sebastiani and Stephan Vogel for their help with the daily big and little issues. Special thanks go to The Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar for helping us with the proposal preparation and management of the QNRF funds and also for supporting us with a Gold sponsorship. Additionally, many thanks go to our silver sponsors, Facebook and Yandex and our bronze sponsor iHorizons, who show the increasing interest of industry in the technology of our community for the design of real-world and high-societal impact applications. In this respect, we sincerely thank Google Inc. and IBM Watson, New York, for supporting the student participation with their scholarships. Finally, and foremost, thanks to all the authors and conference attendees who are the main actors of this event, bringing the real value to it and determining its success. My personal thanks also go to the entire SIGDAT committee, for choosing me as the chair of this fantastic conference, held in a fascinating venue.

As in the previous EMNLP, we invited both long and short papers with a single submission deadline. Short papers encourage the submission of smaller and more preliminary contributions. We received 790 submissions (after initial withdrawals of unfinished submissions and removal of duplicates), of which 28 were rejected before review for not adhering to the instructions in the call for papers regarding paper length or anonymity. The remaining 510 long and 252 short papers were allocated to one of the fourteen areas. The most popular areas this year were Machine Translation, Semantics, and Syntax (Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing). Reviewing for a conference this size involves an army of dedicated professionals volunteering to donate their valuable and scarce time to make sure that the highest possible reviewing standards are reached. We are very grateful to our 26 area chairs and a programme committee of more than 500 for their efforts. We accepted 155 long and 70 short papers, representing a global acceptance rate of just under 30%. Nine papers accepted by the ACL journal TACL were added to the program. Based on the reviews and on nominations by the area chairs, 5 long papers were shortlisted for the best paper award. The best paper will be presented in a plenary best paper award ceremony. We would like to thank Mark Johnson and Claire Cardie for their willingness to serve in the best paper award committee that was set up and for providing excellent advice and motivation for their choice. We are grateful to the authors for selecting EMNLP as the venue for their work. Congratulations to the authors of accepted submissions. To the authors of rejected submissions we would like to offer as consolation the fact that because of the competitive nature of the conference and the inevitable time and space limitations, many worthwhile papers could not be included in the program. We hope the feedback of the reviewers will be considered worthwhile by them and lead to successful future submissions. We are very grateful to our invited speakers Thorsten Joachims and Salim Roukos. Thorsten Joachims is professor at the Computer Science and Information Science departments at Cornell University and shows how integrating microeconomic models of human behavior into the learning process leads to new interaction models and learning algorithms, in turn leading to better performing systems. Salim Roukos is senior manager of multilingual NLP and CTO of Translation Technologies at IBM T.J. Watson research Center and addresses IBM’s approach to cognitive computing for building systems and solutions that enable and support richer human-machine interactions, and remaining opportunities in this area for novel statistical models for natural language processing. We thank them for their inspiring talks and presence at the conference. We would also like to thank our general chair Alessandro Moschitti for his leadership, advice, encouragement, and support, Kareem Darwish and his colleagues for impeccable cooperation from local organization, and Yuval Marton for doing an excellent job assembling these proceedings. It was an honour to serve as Programme Chairs of EMNLP 2014, and we hope that you will enjoy the conference and be able to think back later and remember a scientifically stimulating conference and a pleasant time in Doha, Qatar.
