In particular, genres such as marketing flyers and info-graphics often augment textual information by its color, size, positioning, etc. As a result, traditional text-based approaches to information extraction (IE) could underperform. In this study, we present a supervised machine learning approach to IE from online commercial real estate flyers. We evaluated the performance of SVM classifiers on the task of identifying 12 types of named entities using a combination of textual and visual features.

The majority of the work, however, focuses on the journalistic, scientific, and informal genres (newswires, scientific publications, blogs, tweets, and other social media texts) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) and deals with purely textual corpora. As a result, the feature space of NER systems involves purely textual features, typically word attributes and characteristics (orthography, morphology, dictionary lookup, etc.), their contexts and document features (surrounding word window, local syntax, document/corpus word frequencies, etc.) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).","At the same time, textual information is often presented in visually rich formats, e.g. HTML and PDF. In addition to text, these formats use a variety of visually salient characteristics, (e.g. color, font size, positioning) to either highlight or augment textual information. In some genres and domains, a textual representation of the data, exclud-ing visual features is often not enough to accurately identify named entities of interest or extract relevant information. Marketing materials, such as online flyers or HTML emails, often contain a plethora of visual features and text-based NER approaches lead to poor results. In this paper, we present a supervised approach that uses a combination of textual and visual features to recognize named entities in online marketing materials."]},{"title":"2 Motivation and Problem Definition","paragraphs":["A number of broker-based industries (e.g. commercial real estate, heavy equipment machinery, etc.) lack a centralized searchable database with industry offerings. In particular, the commercial real estate industry (unlike residential real estate) does not have a centralized database or an established source of information. Commercial real estate brokers often need to rely on networking, chance, and waste time with a variety of commercial real estate databases that often present outdated information. While brokers do not often update third party inventory databases, they do create marketing materials (usually PDF flyers) that contain all relevant listing information. Virtually all commercial real estate offerings come with publicly available marketing material that contains all relevant listing information. Our goal is to harness this source of information (the marketing flyer) and use it to extract structured listing information.","Figure 1 shows an example of a commercial real estate flyer. The commercial real estate flyers are often distributed as PDF documents, links to HTML pages, or visually rich HTML-based 1924 Figure 1: An example of a commercial real estate flyer c⃝ Kudan Group Real Estate. emails. They typically contain all relevant listing information such as the address and neighborhood of the offering, the names and contact information of the brokers, the type of space offered (building, land, unit(s) within a building), etc. Similar to other info-graphics, relevant information could be easily pinpointed by visual clues. For example, the listing street address in Figure 1 (1629 N. Halsted St., upper left corner) can be quickly identified and distinguished from the brokerage firm street address (156 N. Jefferson St., upper right corner) due to its visual prominence (font color, size, positioning).","In this study we explored a supervised machine learning approach to the task of identifying listing information from commercial real estate flyers. In particular, we focused on the recognition of 12 types of named entities as described in Table 1 below."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Nadeau and Satoshi (2007) present a survey of NER and describe the feature space of NER research. While they mention multi-media NER in the context of video/text processing, all described features/approaches focus only on textual representation. Broker Name The contact information of all Broker Email listing brokers, including full name, Broker Phone email address, phone number. Company Phone The brokerage company phone number. Street The address information of the City listing address including street or Neighborhood intersection, city, neighborhood, State state, and zip code. Zip Space Size Size and attributes of relevant spaces Space Type (e.g. 27,042 SF building, 4.44 acres site, etc.); Mentions of space type descriptors, e.g. building, land/lot, floor, unit. This excludes space type and size information of non-essential listing attributes (e.g. basement size or parking lot size). Confidential Any mentions of confidentiality. Table 1: Types and descriptions of named entities relevant to extracting listing information from commercial real estate flyers.","The literature on Information Extraction from HTML resources is dominated by various approaches based on wrapper induction (Kushmerick, 1997; Kushmerick, 2000). Wrapper inductions rely on common HTML structure (based on the HTML DOM) and formatting features to extract structured information from similarly format-ted HTML pages. This approach, however, is not applicable to the genres of marketing materials (PDF and HTML) since they typically do not share any common structure that can be used to identify relevant named entities. Laender et al. (2002) present a survey of data extraction techniques and tools from structured or semi-structured web resources.","Cai et al. (2003) present a vision-based segmentation algorithm of web pages that uses HTML layout features and attempts to partition the page at the semantic level. In (Burget and Rudolfova, 2009) authors propose web-page block classification based on visual features. Yang and Zhang (2001) build a content tree of HTML documents based on visual consistency inferred semantics. Burget (2007) proposes a layout based information extraction from HTML documents and states that this visual approach is more robust than traditional DOM-based methods.","Changuel et al.(2009a) describe a system for automatically extracting author information from web-pages. They use spatial information based on the depth of the text node in the HTML DOM tree. In (Changuel et al., 2009b) and (Hu et al., 2006), 1925 the authors proposed a machine learning method for title extraction and utilize format information such as font size, position, and font weight. In (Zhu et al., 2007) authors use layout information based on font size and weight for NER for automated expense reimbursement.","While the idea of utilizing visual features based on HTML style has been previously suggested, this study tackles a non-trivial visually rich dataset that prevents the use of previously suggested simplistic approaches to computing HTML features (such as relying on the HTML DOM tree or simplistic HTML style rendering). In addition, we in-troduce the use of RGB color as a feature and normalize it approximating human perception."]},{"title":"4 Dataset and Method","paragraphs":["The dataset consists of 800 randomly selected commercial real estate flyers spanning 315 US locations, 75 companies, and 730 brokers. The flyers were collected from various online sources and were originally generated using a variety of HTML and PDF creator tools. The collection represents numerous flyer formats and layouts, commercial real estate property types (industrial, retail, office, land, etc.), and transactions (investment, sale, lease).","All flyers were converted to a common format (HTML)1",". The HTML versions of all documents were then annotated by 2 annotators. Figure 2 shows an example of an annotated flyer. Annota-tion guidelines were developed and the 2 annotators were able to achieve an inter-annotator agreement of 91%2",". The named entities with lowest inter-annotator agreement were entities describ-ing Space Size and Type because of the some-what complex rules for determining essential listing space information. For example, one of the space size/type rules reads as follows: If the listing refers to a building and mentions the lot size, include both the land size, the building size, and corresponding space types. Do not include individual parts of the building (e.g. office/basement) as separate spaces. If the listing refers to a UNIT within the building, not the whole building, then DO NOT include the land site as a separate space.","A supervised machine learning approach was 1","PDFs were converted to HTML using the PDFTO-HTML conversion program http://pdftohtml. sourceforge.net/. 2","The inter-annotator agreement was measured as F1-score using one of the annotator’s named entities as the gold standard set and the other as a comparison set. Figure 2: The HTML versions of the flyers were annotated by 2 annotators using a custom web-based annotation tool. then applied to the task of identifying the 12 named entities shown in Table 1. Flyers were converted to text using an HTML parser while preserving some of the white space formatting. The text was tokenized and the task was then modeled as a BIO classification task, classifiers identify the Beginning, the Inside, and Outside of the text segments. We first used a traditional set of text-based features for the classification task. Table 2 lists the various text-based features used. In all cases, a sliding window including the 5 preceding and 5 following tokens was used as features. Feature Name Description Token A normalized string representation of the token. All tokens were converted to lower case and all digits were converted to a common format. Token Orth The token orthography. Possible values are lowercase (all token characters are lower case), all capitals (all token characters are upper case), upper initial (the first token character is upper case, the rest are lower case), mixed (any mixture of upper and lower case letters not included in the previous categories). Token Kind Possible values are word, number, symbol, punctuation. Regex type Regex-based rules were used to mark chunks as one of 3 regex types: email, phone number, zip code. Gazetteer Text chunks were marked as possible US cities or states based on US Census Bureau city and state data. www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2013.html. Table 2: List of text-based features used for the NER task. A sliding window of the 5 preceding and 5 following tokens was used for all features. 1926","As noted previously, human annotators were able to quickly spot named entities of interest solely because of their visual characteristics. For example, a text-only version of the flyer shown in Figure 1, stripped of all rich formatting, will make it quite difficult to distinguish the listing address (shown in prominent size, position, and color) from the brokerage company address, which is rarely prominent as it is not considered important information in the context of the flyer. Similarly, the essential size information for the listing shown on Figure 2 appears prominently on the first page (square footage of the offered restaurant), while non-essential size information, such as the size of the adjacent parking lot or basement, tend to appear in smaller font on subsequent flyer pages.","To account for such visual characteristics we attempted to also include visual features associated with text chunks. We used the computed HTML style attributes for each DOM element containing text. Table 3 lists the computed visual features. Feature Name Description Font Size The computed font-size attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, normalized to 7 basic sizes (xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large). Color The computed color attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element. The RGB values were normalized to a set of 100 basic colors. We converted the RGB values to the YUV color space, and then used Euclidian distance to find the most similar basic color approximating human perception. Y Coordinate The computed top attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, i.e. the y-coordinate in pixels. The pixel locations was normalized to 150 pixel increments (roughly 1/5th of the visible screen for the most common screen resolution.) Table 3: List of visual features used for the NER task. A sliding window of 5 preceding and 5 following DOM elements were used for all features.","Computing the HTML style attributes is a complex task since they are typically defined by a combination of CSS files, in-lined HTML style attributes, and browser defaults. The complexities of style definition, inheritance, and overwriting are handled by browsers3",". We used the 3","We attempted to use an HTML renderer from the Cobra java toolkit http://lobobrowser.org/cobra.jsp to compute HTML style attributes. However, this renderer Chrome browser to compute dynamically the style of each DOM element and output it as inline style attributes. To achieve this we programmatically inserted a javascript snippet that inlines the computed style and saves the new version of the HTML on the local file system utilizing the HTML5 saveAs interface4",". Details on how we normalized the style attribute values for font size, RGB color, and Y coordinate are shown in Table 3.","We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 2000) on the NER task using the LibSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011). We chose SVMs as they have been shown to perform well on a variety of NER tasks, for example (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield et al., 2003; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2008). We used a linear kernel model with the default parameters. The multi-class problem was converted to binary problems using the one-vsothers scheme. 80% of the documents were used for training, and the remaining 20% for testing."]},{"title":"5 Results","paragraphs":["Results are shown in Table 4. We compared classifier performance using only textual features (first 3 columns), versus performance using both textual and visual features (next 3 columns). Results were averaged over 2 runs of randomly selected train-ing/test documents with 80%/20% ratio. We used an exact measure which considers an answer to be correct only if both the entity boundaries and entity type are accurately predicted.","The addition of visual features significantly5 increased the overall F1-score from 83 to 87%. As expected, performance gains are more significant for named entities that are typically visually salient and are otherwise difficult (or impossible) to identify in a text-only version of the flyers.

In particular, the F1-score for mentions of Neighborhoods (typically prominently shown on the first page of the flyers) improved by 19%; F1-score for mentions of the listing State improved by 9%; and Street, City, Zip by roughly 4% each, all produced poor results on our dataset and failed to accurately compute the pixel location of text elements. 4","https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver. js 5","The difference is statistically significant with p value < 0.0001% using Z-test on two proportions. 1927 Named Entity Pt Rt Ft Pv+t Rv+t Fv+t S Broker Name 82.7 91.7 87.0 95.0 91.6 93.2 Y Broker Email 92.3 92.8 92.6 97.2 90.2 93.6 N Broker Phone 90.2 86.1 88.1 94.7 85.2 89.7 N Company Ph. 95.2 67.4 78.9 89.8 65.4 75.7 N Street 87.4 70.5 78.1 87.3 77.3 82.0 Y City 92.5 88.5 90.5 94.9 92.8 93.8 Y Neighborhood 68.2 52.8 59.5 85.3 72.9 78.6 Y State 77.4 97.5 86.3 95.8 95.0 95.4 Y Zip 89.7 94.5 92.1 96.1 97.1 96.6 Y Space Size 80.2 65.0 71.8 87.0 70.6 77.9 Y Space Type 76.0 74.7 75.3 78.6 72.2 75.3 N Confidential 100 60.0 75.0 75.0 85.7 79.9 N OVERALL 84.8 81.3 83.0 91.2 83.2 87.0 Y Table 4: Results from applying SVM using the textual features described in Table 2, as well as both the textual and visual features described in Tables 2 and 3. t=textual features only, v+t=visual + textual features, P=Precision, R=Recall, F=F1-score, S=Significant Difference statistically significant.

Ubiquitous online and digital formats such as PDF and HTML often exploit the interaction of textual and visual elements. Information is often augmented or conveyed by non-textual features such as positioning, font size, color, and images. However, traditionally, NER approaches rely exclusively on textual features and as a result could perform poorly in visually rich genres such as online marketing flyers or info-graphics. We have evaluated the performance gain on the task of NER from commercial real estate flyers by adding visual features to a set of traditional text-based features. We used SVM classifiers for the task of identifying 12 types of named entities. Results show that overall visual features improved performance significantly. 6 p value = 0.7323% using Z-test on two proportions."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Radek Burget and Ivana Rudolfova. 2009.
