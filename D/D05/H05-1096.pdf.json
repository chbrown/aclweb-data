Since sentences produced by a machine translation system are often incorrect but may contain correct parts, a method for identifying those correct parts and finding possible errors is desirable. For this purpose, each word in the generated target sentence is assigned a value expressing the confidence that it is correct. Confidence measures have been extensively stud-","ied for speech recognition, but are not well known","in other areas. Only recently have researchers","started to investigate confidence measures for ma-","chine translation (Blatz et al., 2004; Gandrabur and","Foster, 2003; Quirk, 2004; Ueffing et al., 2003). We apply word confidence measures in MT as fol-","lows: For a given translation generated by a machine","translation system, we determine a confidence value","for each word and compare it to a threshold. All","words whose confidence is above this threshold are","tagged as correct and all others are tagged as incor-","rect translations. The threshold is optimized on a","distinct development set beforehand. Possible applications for confidence measures in-","clude • post-editing, where words with low confidence","could be marked as potential errors, • improving translation prediction accuracy in","trans-type-style interactive machine transla-","tion (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing and","Ney, 2005), • combining output from different machine","translation systems: hypotheses with low confi-","dence can be discarded before selecting one of","the system translations (Akiba et al., 2004), or","the word confidence scores can be used for gen-","erating new hypotheses from the output of dif-","ferent systems (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), or","the sentence confidence value can be employed","for re-ranking (Blatz et al., 2003).","In this paper, we will present several approaches to word-level confidence estimation and develop a new phrase-based confidence measure which is independent of the machine translation system which 763 generated the translation. The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we will briefly review the statistical approach to machine translation. The phrase-based translation system, which serves as basis for the new confidence measure, will be presented in section 2.2. Section 3 will give an overview of related work on confidence estimation for statistical machine translation (SMT). In section 4, we will describe methods for confidence estimation which make use of SMT system output such as word graphs and N -best lists. In section 5, we will present the new phrase-based confidence measure. Section 6 contains a short description of an IBM-1 based confidence measure to which we will compare the other measures. Experimental evaluation and comparison of the different confidence measures will be shown in section 7, and section 8 will conclude the paper."]},{"title":"2 Statistical machine translation 2.1 General","paragraphs":["In statistical machine translation, the translation is modeled as a decision process: Given a source string f J 1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ , we seek the target string eI","1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI with maximal posterior probability:","êÎ","1 = argmax","I,eI","1","{","P r(eI","1 | f J","1 )} (1)","= argmax I,eI","1","{","P r(f J 1 | eI","1) · P r(eI","1)} Through this decomposition of the probability, we obtain two knowledge sources: the translation model P r(f J","1 | eI","1) and the language model P r(eI","1). Both of them can be modeled independently of each other. The translation model is responsible for linking the source string f J","1 and the target string eI","1, i.e. it captures the semantics of the sentence. The target language model captures the well-formedness or the syntax in the target language. Nowadays, most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Bertoldi et al., 2004; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2003; Vogel et al., 2004; Zens and Ney, 2004). Note that those phrases are sequences of words in the two languages and not necessarily phrases in the linguistic sense. A more detailed description of a phrase-based approach to statistical machine translation will be given in section 2.2. 2.2 Review of phrase-based translation system For the confidence measures which will be introduced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrase-based approach as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004). The key elements of this translation approach are bilingual phrases, i.e. pairs of source and target language phrases where a phrase is simply a contiguous sequence of words. These bilingual phrases are extracted from a word-aligned bilingual training corpus.","We will present the equations for a monotone search here in order to keep the equations simple. Let (jK","0 , iK","0 ) be a segmentation of the source sentence into phrases, with the corresponding (bilingual) phrase pairs ( f̃k, ẽk) = (f jk jk−1+1, e","ik","ik−1+1), k = 1, . . . , K. The phrase-","based approach to SMT is then expressed by the fol-","lowing equation:","êÎ","1 = argmax jK 0 ,iK","0 ,I,eI","1 { I∏ i=1 [ c1 · p(ei | ei−1","i−2)λ1 ] (2) · K∏ k=1 [","c2 · p( f̃k | ẽk)λ2 · p(ẽk | f̃k)λ3 · jk ∏ j=jk−1+1","p(fj | ẽk)λ4 · ik ∏ i=ik−1+1 p(ei | f̃k)λ5 ]} , where p( f̃k | ẽk) and p(ẽk | f̃k) are the phrase lexicon models in both translation directions. The phrase translation probabilities are computed as a log-linear interpolation of the relative frequencies and the IBM-1 probability. The single word based lexicon models are denoted as p(fj | ẽk) and p(ei | f̃k), respectively. p(fj | ẽk) is defined as the IBM-1 model probability of fj over the whole phrase ẽk, and p(ei | f̃k) is the inverse model, respectively.","c1 is the so-called word penalty, and c2 is the phrase penalty, assigning constant costs to each target language word/phrase. The language model is a trigram model with modified Kneser-Ney discounting and interpolation (Stolcke, 2002). The search determines the target sentence and segmentation which maximize the objective function.","As equation 2 shows, the sub-models are combined via weighted log-linear interpolation. The model scaling factors λ1, . . . , λ5 and the word and phrase penalties are optimized with respect to some evaluation criterion (Och, 2003), e.g. BLEU score. 764"]},{"title":"3 Confidence measures for SMT 3.1 Related work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we will present a new approach to word-level confidence estimation which makes explicit use of a phrase-based translation model. Most of the word-level confidence measures which have been presented in the literature so far are either based on relatively simple translation models such as IBM-1 (Blatz et al., 2003) or make use of information provided by the SMT system such as N -best lists or word graphs (Blatz et al., 2003; Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing et al., 2003). In contrast to this, our method is based on a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation model, but nevertheless is independent of the machine translation system which generates the translation hypotheses.","The word-level confidence measures which showed the best performance in comparative experiments (Blatz et al., 2003) are word posterior probabilities and the IBM-1 based measure. Our new confidence measure will be compared to those approaches in section 7.3. 3.2 Word posterior probabilities The confidence of a target word can be expressed by its posterior probability, i.e. the probability of the word to occur in the target sentence, given the source sentence. Consider a target word e occurring in the sentence in position i1",". The posterior probability of this event can be determined by summing over all possible target sentences eI","1 containing the word e in position i:","pi(e, f J 1 ) = ∑","I,eI 1: ei=e","p(eI 1, f J","1 ) (3) This value has to be normalized in order to obtain a probability distribution over all possible target words:","pi(e | f J 1 ) =","pi(e, f J 1 ) ∑ e′","pi(e′ , f J","1 ) (4)","1","This is a rather strict assumption, because the position of a word in the target sentence can differ largely due to reorderings in the translation process. We present this variant here to keep the notation simple. Improved methods will be shown in the following sections."]},{"title":"4 System based confidence measures","paragraphs":["In this section, we will present confidence measures which are based on N -best lists or word graphs generated by the SMT system. Those are representa-tions of the space of the most likely translations of the source sentence.","The summation given in equation 3 is performed over all sentences which are contained in the N -best list or word graph. For a more detailed description, see (Ueffing et al., 2003). 4.1 Word graph based approach The word posterior probability pi(e | f J","1 ) can be calculated over a word graph using the forward-backward algorithm.","Let n′",", n be nodes in a word graph, and (n′",", n) the directed edge connecting them. The edge is annotated with a target word which we denote by e(n′",", n) and the probability which this word contributes to the overall sentence probability, denoted by p(n′",", n).","The forward probability Φi(n′",", n) of an edge is the probability of reaching this edge from the source of the graph, where the word e(n′",", n) is the i-th word on the path. It can be obtained by summing the probabilities of all incoming paths of length i − 1, which allows for recursive calculation. This leads to the following formula:","Φi(n′",", n) = p(n′",", n) · ∑ n′′","Φi−1(n′′ , n′",") . The backward probability expresses the probability of completing a sentence from the current edge, i.e. of reaching the sink of the graph. It can be determined recursively in descending order of i as follows:","Ψi(n′",", n) = p(n′",", n) · ∑ n∗","Ψi+1(n, n∗ ) .","Using the forward-backward algorithm, the word posterior probability of word e in position i is determined by combining the forward and backward probabilities of all edges which are annotated with e. This yields","pi(e, f J 1 ) = ∑","(n′ ,n) : e(n′",",n)=e","Φi(n′ , n) · Ψ i(n′",", n)","p(n′ , n) . (5) Note that (for computational reasons) the term p(n′",", n) is included both in the forward and in the 765 backward probability so that we have to divide the product by this term.","To obtain a posterior probability, a normalization, as shown in equation 4, has to be performed. The normalization term α := ∑ e′","pi(e′ , f J","1 ) corresponds to the probability mass contained in the word graph and can be calculated by summing the backward probabilities of all outgoing edges leaving the source s of the graph: α = ∑ (s,n) Ψ1(s, n) .","As stated above, the position of word e in the target sentence can vary due to reorderings in the translation process. Therefore, we would like to relax the condition that e has to occur exactly in position i. This can be achieved by introducing a window of size t over the neighboring target positions and computing the sum of the word posterior probabilities over all positions i − t, . . . , i, . . . , i + t. In our experiments we found that a window over ±3 positions yields the best performance. 4.2 N -best list based approach N -best lists are an alternative representation of the space of translation hypotheses. They have the advantage that the Levenshtein alignment between a hypothesis and all sentences contained in the list can be performed easily. This makes it possible to consider not only target sentences, which contain the word e exactly in a position i (as given in equation 3), but to allow for some variation.","Let L(eI","1, ẽĨ","1) be the Levenshtein alignment between sentences eI","1 and ẽĨ","1. Then, Li(eI","1, ẽĨ","1) denotes the Levenshtein alignment of word ei, i.e. the word in sentence ẽĨ","1 which ei is Levenshtein-aligned to.","The word posterior probability is then calculated by summing over all target sentences containing word e in a position which is Levenshtein-aligned to i:","pi(e|f J 1 , I, eI","1) =","pi(e, f J 1 , I, eI","1) ∑ e′","pi(e′ , f J 1 , I, eI","1) ,","where","pi(e, f J","1 , I, eI","1) = ∑","Ĩ,ẽ ̃","I","1: Li(eI","1,ẽ ̃","I","1)=e","p(ẽĨ 1, f J","1 ) . (6) The confidence of word e then depends on the source sentence f J","1 as well as the target sentence eI","1, because the whole target sentence is relevant for the Levenshtein alignment."]},{"title":"5 Phrase-based confidence measures","paragraphs":["In contrast to the approaches presented in section 4, the phrase-based confidence measures do not not use the context information at the sentence level, but only at the phrase level. We want to determine a sort of marginal probability Q(e, f J","1 ). Therefore, we extract all source phrases f","j+s","j which occur in the given source sentence. For such source phrases, we find the possible translations ei+t","i in the bilingual phrase lexicon. The confidence of target word e is then calculated by summing over all phrase pairs (f","j+s","j , ei+t","i ) where the target part ei+t","i contains the word e. Let p(ei+t","i ) be the language model score of the target phrase together with the word penalty c1, i.e.","p(ei+t i ) = i+t∏ i′ =i","c1 · p(ei′ | ei′ −1 i′ −2)λ1",". Analogously, define p(f","j+s","j , ei+t","i ) as the score of the phrase pair which consists of the phrase penalty and the phrase and word lexicon model scores (cf. section 2.2). Following equation 2, the (unnormalized) confidence is then determined as:","Q(e, f J 1 ) = J∑ j=1","min{smax,J−j} ∑ s=0 (7) ∑ ei+t i : e ∈ ei+t","i","p(ei+t i ) · p(f j+s j , ei+t","i ) , where s ≤ smax and t are source and target phrase lengths, smax being the maximal source phrase length.","In equation 7, the language model only determines the probability of the words within the target part of the phrase, and not across the phrase boundaries, because we consider only the single target phrases without context. Therefore, we assumed that the language model would not have much influence on the confidence estimation and also investigated a model without a language model. The same holds for word and phrase penalty: In the translation process they are useful for adjusting the length of the 766 generated target hypothesis and for assigning more weight to longer phrases. Since this does not make much sense in our setting, we also investigated confidence estimation without word and phrase penalty.","Note that the value calculated in equation 7 is not normalized. In order to obtain a word posterior probability, we divide this value by the sum over the (unnormalized) confidence of all target words:","pphr(e | f J 1 ) =","Q(e, f J 1 ) ∑ e′","Q(e′ , f J","1 ) . (8)","Unlike the word posterior probabilities presented in the previous section, this value is completely independent of the target sentence position in which the word e occurs.","As stated in section 2.2, the scaling factors of the different sub-models and the penalties in the translation system are optimized with respect to some evaluation criterion. But since the values which are optimal for translation are not necessarily optimal for confidence estimation, we perform optimization here as well: We train the probability models on the training corpus, estimate the word confidences on the development corpus, and optimize the scaling factors with respect to the classification error rate described in section 7.2. The optimization is performed with the Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press et al., 2002)."]},{"title":"6 IBM-1 based approach","paragraphs":["Another type of confidence measure which does not rely on system output and is thus applicable to any kind of machine translation system is the IBM-1 model based confidence measure which was introduced in (Blatz et al., 2003). We modified this confidence measure because we found that the average lexicon probability used there is dominated by the maximum. Therefore, we determine the maximal translation probability of the target word e over the source sentence words:","pIBM−1(e|f J","1 ) = max","j=0,...,J p(e|fj) , (9) where f0 is the “empty” source word (Brown et al., 1993). The probabilities p(e|fj) are word-based lexicon probabilities.","Investigations on the use of the IBM-1 model for word confidence measures showed promising results (Blatz et al., 2003; Blatz et al., 2004). Thus, we apply this method here in order to compare it to the other types of confidence measures."]},{"title":"7 Experiments 7.1 Experimental setting","paragraphs":["The experiments were performed on three different language pairs. All corpora were compiled in the EU project TransType2; they consist of technical manuals. The corpus statistics are given in table 1. The SMT systems that the confidence estimation was performed for were trained on these corpora. The same holds for the probability models that were used to estimate the word confidences.","We used several (S)MT systems for testing the confidence measures. A detailed analysis will be given for two of them; the so-called alignment template system (Och and Ney, 2004), (denoted as AT in the tables) and the phrase-based translation system described in section 2.2 (denoted as PBT in the tables). They are both state-of-the-art SMT systems. We produced single best translations, word graphs and N -best lists on all three language pairs using these systems. The translation quality in terms of WER, PER (position independent word error rate), BLEU and NIST score is given in tables 2 and 3. We see that the best results are obtained on Spanish to English translation, followed by French to English and German to English.","Two more translation systems were used for comparative experiments: One is a statistical MT system which is based on a finite state architecture (FSA). For a description of this system, see (Kanthak et al., 2005). Additionally, we used translations generated by Systran2",". Table 3 presents the translation error rates and scores for all systems on the German → English test corpus. These hypotheses were used to investigate whether the phrase-based confidence measures perform well independently of the translation system.","All three SMT systems (AT, PBT and FSA) show very similar performance on the German → English test corpus. The fact that Systran generates translations of much lower quality is due to the fact that the technical manuals are very specific in terminology, and the SMT systems have been trained on similar corpora.","2","http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr, June 2005 767","Table 1: Statistics of the training, development and test corpora.","French English Spanish English German English","TRAIN Sentences 53 046 55 761 49 376 Running Words 680 796 628 329 752 606 665 399 537 464 589 531","Vocabulary 15 632 13 816 11 050 7 956 23 845 13 223","DEV Sentences 994 1 012 964 Running Words 11 674 10 903 15 957 14 278 10 462 10 642","OOVs 184 141 54 27 147 29","TEST Sentences 984 1 125 996 Running Words 11 709 11 177 10 106 8 370 11 704 12 298","OOVs 204 201 69 49 485 141","Table 2: Translation quality of systems AT and PBT","on the test corpora described in table 1.","AT PBT","S→E F→E S→E F→E WER[%] 29.6 54.8 26.1 54.9 PER[%] 20.1 43.7 17.5 43.4 BLEU[%] 63.4 31.5 66.9 31.3 NIST 8.80 6.64 8.98 6.62","Table 3: Translation quality of all MT systems on","the German → English test corpus.","AT PBT FSA Systran WER[%] 62.7 61.6 63.2 79.2 PER[%] 49.8 49.6 50.4 66.4 BLEU[%] 26.6 25.7 26.5 12.0 NIST 5.92 5.72 5.79 4.09","To determine the true class of each word in a generated translation hypothesis, we use the word error rate (WER). That is, a target word is considered correct if it is aligned to itself in the Levenshtein alignment between hypothesis and reference translation(s). We also investigated PER based classification, but since the tendencies of the results were similar, we omit them here. 7.2 Evaluation metrics After computing the confidence measure, each generated word is tagged as either correct or false, depending on whether its confidence exceeds the tagging threshold that has been optimized on the development set beforehand. The performance of the confidence measure is evaluated using the Classification Error Rate (CER). This is defined as the number of incorrect tags divided by the total number of generated words in the translated sentence. The baseline CER is determined by assigning the most frequent class to all translations. In the case that the most frequent class is “correct” (meaning at least half of the words in the generated translation are correct w.r.t. to WER), this is the number of substitutions and in-sertions, divided by the number of generated words. The CER strongly depends on the tagging threshold. Therefore, the tagging threshold is adjusted before-hand (to minimize CER) on a development corpus distinct to the test set. 7.3 Experimental results Table 4 shows the performance of all different confidence measures on the hypotheses generated by the alignment template system and the phrase-based system. For the baseline CER, we determined the 90%- and 99%-confidence intervals using the bootstrap estimation method described in (Bisani and Ney, 2004)3",". We see that, in all settings but one, the word graph and the N -best list based method out-perform the IBM-1 based confidence measure. On French → English, the improvement over the baseline is significant at the 1%-level for these methods, whereas on Spanish → English this is only the case at 10%. The performance of the N -best list based approach is better than that of the word graph based 3 The tool is freely available from http://www-i6.informatik.","rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/index.html 768 confidence measures for the alignment template system. This is probably due to the fact that the former can take the Levenshtein alignment into account and thus estimate the word confidence more reliably.","The phrase-based confidence measures show a performance which is clearly better than that of the other methods. We obtain a relative improvement of up to 7.8% over the best existing method on these language pairs. The improvement over the baseline is significant even at the 1%-level in all cases.","When analyzing the impact of the different sub-models in the phrase-based approach, we found that the language model does not have much impact on the confidence estimation. There are only slight variations in the CER if the model is omitted. The word and phrase penalty on the other hand seem to be important (with one exception in the first setting).","The evaluation of the system-independent confidence measures (i.e. those based on IBM-1 and the new phrase-based method we presented) for four different translation systems is shown in table 5. We see that, for all of them, the phrase-based approach outperforms the IBM-1 based method significantly. The largest gain in terms of CER is achieved for the Systran translations: 23.8% relative over the IBM-1 based measure."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion and outlook","paragraphs":["We presented a new approach to word-level confidence estimation for machine translation which makes use of bilingual phrases. By using models from a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system, the word confidences are estimated only on the basis of single best system output. Unlike other confidence measures, this does not rely on information from the machine translation system which generated the translation.","Experimental evaluation on three different language pairs and on output from structurally different translation systems showed that the new confidence measures perform better than existing confidence measures in all cases. The application on output from different MT systems yielded a significant reduction of the error rate over the existing measures. This proves that the method is well-suited for word confidence estimation on statistical as well as non-statistical MT systems.","The task investigated in this work was a text translation task in the domain of technical manuals. We are currently investigating the use of word-level confidence measures on data from the European parliament. It will be interesting to see whether a similar performance can be achieved on this large vocabulary speech translation task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This work was partly funded by the European Union under the RTD project TransType2 (IST–2001– 32091), and under the integrated project TC-STAR – Technology and Corpora for Speech to Speech Translation (IST-2002-FP6-506738)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Y.
