We also provide evidence that the exploitation of the sentences surrounding a citation to a paper can yield higher accuracy than other sentences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Identifying the interactions between proteins is one of the most important challenges in modern genomics, with applications throughout cell biology, including expression analysis, signaling, and rational drug design. Most biomedical research and new discoveries are available electronically but only in free text format, so automatic mechanisms are needed to convert text into more structured forms. The goal of this paper is to address this difficult and important task, the extraction of the interactions between proteins from free text. We use graphical models and a neural net that were found to achieve high accuracy in the related task of extracting the relation types might hold between the entities “treatment” and “disease” (Rosario and Hearst, 2004).","Labeling training and test data is time-consuming and subjective. Here we report on results using an existing curated database, the HIV-1 Human Protein Interaction Database1",", to train and test the classification system. The accuracies obtained by the classification models proposed are quite high, confirming the validity of the approach. We also find support for the hypothesis that the sentences surrounding citations are useful for extraction of key information from technical articles (Nakov et al., 2004).","In the remainder of this paper we discuss related work, describe the dataset, and show the results of the algorithm on documents and sentences."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["There has been little work in general NLP on trying to identify different relations between entities. Many papers that claim to be doing relationship recognition in actuality address the task of role extraction: (usually two) entities are identified and the relationship is implied by the co-occurrence of these entities or by some linguistic expression (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002).","The ACE competition2","has a relation recognition subtask, but assumes a particular type of relation holds between particular entity types (e.g., if the two entities in question are an EMP and an ORG, then an employment relation holds between them; which type of employment relation depends on the type of entity, e.g., staff person vs partner).","1","www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions/index.html","2","http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.01/tests/ace/ 732","In the BioNLP literature there have recently been a number of attempts to automatically extract protein-protein interactions from PubMed abstracts. Some approaches simply report that a relation exists between two proteins but do not determine which relation holds (Bunescu et al., 2005; Marcotte et al., 2001; Ramani et al., 2005), while most others start with a list of interaction verbs and label only those sentences that contain these trigger words (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Blaschke et al., 1999; Rindflesch et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Sekimizu et al., 1998; Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003; Pustejovsky et al., 2002). However, as Marcotte et al. (2001) note, “... searches for abstracts containing relevant keywords, such as interact*, poorly discriminate true hits from abstracts using the words in alternate senses and miss abstracts using different language to describe the interactions.”","Most of the existing methods also suffer from low recall because they use hand-built specialized templates or patterns (Ono et al., 2001; Corney et al., 2004). Some systems use link grammars in conjunc-tion with trigger verbs instead of templates (Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003).

Figure 1 shows the generative dynamic model, based on previous work on role and relation extraction (Rosario and Hearst, 2004) where the task was to extract the entities TREATMENT and DISEASE and the relationships between them. The nodes labeled “Role” represent the entities (in this case the choices are PROTEIN and NULL); the children of the role nodes are the words (which act as features), thus there are as many role states as there are words in the sentence; this model consists of a Markov sequence of states where each state generates one or multiple observations. This model makes the additional assumption that there is an interaction present in the sentence (represented by the node “Inter.”) that generates the role sequence and the observations. (We assume here that there is a single interaction for each sentence.) The “Role” nodes can be observed or hidden. The results reported here were obtained using only the words as features (i.e., in the dynamic model of Figure 1 there is only one feature node per role) and with the “Role” nodes hidden (i.e., we had no information regarding which proteins were involved). Inference is performed with the junction tree algorithm8",".","We used a second type of graphical model, a simple Naive Bayes, in which the node representing the interaction generates the observable features (all the words in the sentence). We did not include role information in this model.","We defined joint probability distributions over these models, estimated using maximum likelihood on the training set with a simple absolute discount-ing smoothing method. We performed 10-fold cross validation on the training set and we chose the smoothing parameters for which we obtained the best classification accuracies (averaged over the ten runs) on the training data; the results reported here were obtained using these parameters on the held-out test sets9",".","In addition to these two generative models, we also used a discriminative model, a neural network. We used the Matlab package to train a feed-forward network with conjugate gradient descent. The network has one hidden layer, with a hyperbolic tangent function, and an output layer representing the relationships. A logistic sigmoid function is used in the output layer. The network was trained for several choices of numbers of hidden units; we chose the best-performing networks based on training set error. We then tested these networks on held-out testing data. The features were words, the same as those used for the graphical models.","8","Using Kevin Murphy’s BNT package: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/m̃urphyk/Software/BNT/bnt.html.","9","We did not have enough data to require that the sentences in the training and test sets of the cross validation procedure originate from disjoint triples (they do originate from disjoint triple in the final held out data).

During testing, we choose the interaction using the following aggregate measures that use the constraint that all sentences coming from the same triple are assigned the same interaction."," Mj: For each triple, for each sentence of the triple, find the interaction that maximizes the posterior probability of the interaction given the features; then assign to all sentences of this triple the most frequent interaction among those predicted for the individual sentences."," Cf: Retain all the conditional probabilities (do not choose an interaction per sentence), then, for each triple, choose the interaction that maximizes the sum over all the triple’s sentences.","Table 3 reports the results in terms of classification accuracies averaged across all interactions, for the cases “all” (sentences from “papers” and “citances” together), only “papers” and only “citances”. The accuracies are quite high; the dynamic model achieves around 60% for “all,” 58% for “papers” and 54% for “citances.” The neural net achieves the best results for “all” with around 64% accuracy. From these results we can make the following observations: all models greatly outperform the baselines; the performances of the dynamic model DM, the Naive Bayes NB and the NN are very similar; for “papers” the best results were obtained with the graphical models; for “all” and “citances” the neural net did best. The use of “citances” allowed the gathering of additional data (and therefore a larger training set) that lead to higher accuracies (see “papers” versus “all”).","In the confusion matrix in Table 5 we can see the accuracies for the individual interactions for the dynamic model DM, using “all” and “Mj.” For three interactions this model achieves perfect accuracy. 5.1 Hiding the protein names In order to ensure that the algorithm was not over-fitting on the protein names, we ran an experiment in which we replaced the protein names in all sentences with the token “PROT NAME.” For example, the sentence: “Selective CXCR4 antagonism by Tat” became: “Selective PROT NAME2 antagonism by PROT NAME1.”","Table 5.1 shows the results of running the models on this data. For “papers” and “citances” there is always a decrease in the classification accuracy when we remove the protein names, showing that the protein names do help the classification. The differences in accuracy in the two cases using “citances” are much smaller than the differences using “papers” at least for the graphical models. This suggests that citation sentences may be more robust for some language processing tasks and that the models that use “citances” learn better the linguistic context of the interactions. Note how in this case the graphical models always outperform the neural network. 5.2 Using a “trigger word” approach As mentioned above, much of the related work in this field makes use of “trigger words” or “interaction words” (see Section 2).

For example, for the interaction degrade some of the keywords are “degradation,” “degrade,” for inhibit we have “inhibited,” “inhibitor,” “inhibitory” and others. We then checked whether a sentence contained such keywords. If it did, we assigned to the sentence the corresponding interaction. If it contained more than one keyword corresponding to multiple interactions consisting of the generic interact with plus a more specific one, we assigned the more specific interaction; if the two predicted interactions did not include interact with but two more specific interactions, we did not assign an interaction, since we wouldn’t know how to choose between them. Similarly, we assigned no interaction if there were more than two predicted interactions or no keywords present in the sentence. The results are shown in the rows labeled “Key” and “KeyB” in Table 3. Case “KeyB” is the “Key” method with back-off: when no interaction was predicted, we assigned to the sentence the most frequent interaction in the training data. As before, we calculated the accuracy when we force all the sentences from one triple to be assign to the most frequent interaction among those predicted for the individual sentences.","KeyB is more accurate than Key and although the KeyB accuracies are higher than the other baselines, they are significantly lower than those obtained with the trained models. The low accuracies of the trigger-word based methods show that the relation classification task is nontrivial, in the sense that not all the sentences contain the most obvious word for the interactions, and suggests that the trigger word approach is insufficient. 5.3 Protein extraction The dynamic model of Figure 1 has the appealing property of simultaneously performing interaction recognition and protein name tagging (also known as role extraction): the task consists of identifying all the proteins present in the sentence, given a sequence of words. We assessed a slightly different task: the identification of all (and only) the proteins present in the sentence that are involved in the interaction.","The F-measure10","achieved by this model for this task is 0.79 for “all,” 0.67 for “papers” and 0.79 for “citances”; again, the model parameters were chosen with cross validation on the training set, and “ci-10 The F-measure is a weighted combination of precision and","recall. Here, precision and recall are given equal weight, that is,","F-measure =",". 737 tances” had superior performance. Note that we did not use a dictionary: the system learned to recognize the protein names using only the training data. Moreover, our role evaluation is quite strict: every token is assessed and we do not assign partial credit for constituents for which only some of the words are correctly labeled. We also did not use the information that all the sentences extracted from one triple contain the same proteins.","Given these strong results (both F-measure and classification accuracies), we believe that the dynamic model of Figure 1 is a good model for performing both name tagging and interaction classification simultaneously, or either of these task alone. 5.4 Sentence-level evaluation In addition to assigning interactions to protein pairs, we are interested in sentence-level semantics, that is, in determining the interactions that are actually expressed in the sentence. To test whether the information assigned to the entire document by the HIV-1 database record can be used to infer information at the sentence level, an annotator with biological expertise hand-annotated the sentences from the experiments. The annotator was instructed to assign to each sentence one of the interactions of Table 2, “not interacting,” or “other” (if the interaction between the two proteins was not one of Table 2).","Of the 2114 sentences that were hand-labeled, 68.3% of them disagreed with the HIV-1 database label, 28.4% agreed with the database label, and 3.3% were found to contain multiple interactions between the proteins. Among the 68.3% of the sentences for which the labels did not agree, 17.4% had the vague interact with relation, 7.4% did not contain any interaction and 43.5% had an interaction different from that specified by the triple11",". In Table 6 we report the mismatch between the two sets of labels. The total accuracy of 38.9%12","provides a useful baseline for using a database for the labeling at the sentence level. It may be the case that certain interactions tend to be biologically related and thus 11","For 28% of the triples, none of the sentences extracted from the target paper were found by the annotator to contain the interaction given by the database. We read four of these papers and found sentences containing that interaction, but our system had failed to extract them. 12","The accuracy without the vague interact with is 49.4%.","All Papers Citan.

It turned out that the authors of the article assigned stimulate found little evidence for this interaction (in favor of inhibit), suggesting an error in the database. In another case the database interaction was require but the authors of the article, while supporting this, found that under certain conditions (when a protein is too abundant) the interaction changes to one of inhibit. Thus we were able to find controversial facts about protein interactions just by looking at the confusion matrix of Table 6.","We trained the models using these hand-labeled sentences in order to determine the interaction expressed for each sentence (as opposed to for each document). This is a difficult task; for some sentences it took the annotator several minutes to understand them and decide which interaction applied. Table 7 shows the results on running the classification models on the six interactions for which there were more than 40 examples in the training sets. Again, the sentences from “papers” are especially difficult to classify; the best result for “papers” is 36.7% accuracy versus 63.2% accuracy for “citances.” In this case the difference in performance of “papers” and “citances” is larger than for the previous task of document-level relation classification."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We tackled an important and difficult task, the classification of different interaction types between proteins in text.
