Therefore, numerous NLP applications, such as, Question Answering, Information Extraction, or Summarization require computational models of language that recognize if two texts semantically overlap. Trying to capture the major inferences needed to understand equivalent semantic expressions, the PASCAL Network proposed the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenge (Dagan et al., 2005). Given two text fragments, the task is to determine if the meaning of one text (the entailed hypothesis, H) can be inferred from the meaning of the other text (the entailing text, T ).","Given the wide applicability of this task, there is an increased interest in creating systems which detect the semantic entailment between two texts. The systems that participated in the Pascal RTE challenge competition exploit various inference elements which, later, they combine within statistical models, scoring methods, or machine learning frameworks. Several systems (Bos and Markert, 2005; Herrera et al., 2005; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005; Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005; Newman et al., 2005) measured the word overlap between the two text strings. Using either statistical or WordNet’s relations, almost all systems considered lexical relationships that indicate entailment. The degree of similarity between the syntactic parse trees of the two texts was also used as a clue for entailment by several systems (Herrera et al., 2005; Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Raina et al., 2005). Several groups used logic provers to show the entailment between T and H (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005; Raina et al., 2005) and some of them made use of world knowledge axioms to increase the logic prover’s power of inference (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005).","In this paper, we describe a novel technique which employs a set of semantic axioms in its attempt to exhaustively extract semantic knowledge from texts. In order to show the contribution that our semantic information extraction method brings, we append it as an additional module to an already existing system that participated in the RTE challenge. Our system (Fowler et al., 2005), rst, transforms the text T and the hypothesis H into semantically enhanced logic forms, and, then, the integrated logic prover tries to prove or disprove the entailment using a set of world-knowledge axioms (die of blood loss → bleed to death), linguistic rewriting rules which break down complex syntactic structures, like coordinating conjunctions, and WordNet-based lexical chains axioms (buy/VB/1 → pay/VB/1). 371"]},{"title":"2 Approach","paragraphs":["We believe that a logic-based semantic approach is highly appropriate for the RTE task1",". Text T semantically entails H if its meaning logically implies the meaning of H. Because the set of semantic relations encoded in a text represents its meaning, we need to identify all the semantic relations that hold between the constituents of T and, subsequently, between the constituents of H to understand the meaning of each text. It should be noted that state-of-the-art semantic parsers extract only some of the semantic relations encoded in a given text. To complete this information, we need semantic axioms that augment the extracted knowledge and, thus, provide a better coverage of the text’s semantics. Once we gather this information, we state that text T entails hypothesis H if and only if we nd similar relations between a concept from T and a semantically analogous concept from H. By analogous concepts, we mean identical concepts, or words connected by a chain of SYNONYMY, HYPERNYMY or morphologi-cal derivation relations in WordNet.","Because the set of semantic elements identied by a semantic parser does not necessarily convey the complete meaning of a sentence, we shall use a set of semantic axioms to infer the missing pieces of information. By combining two semantic relations or by using the FrameNet’s frame elements identied in a given text, we derive new semantic information.","In order to show if T entails H, we analyze their meanings. Our approach to semantic entailment in-volves the following stages: 1. We convert each text into logic form (Moldovan and Rus, 2001). This conversion includes part-of-speech tagging, parse tree generation, and name entity recognition. 2. Using our semantic parser, we identify some of the semantic relations encoded in the analyzed texts. We note that state-of-the-art semantic parsers cannot discover all the semantic relations conveyed implicitly or explicitly by the text. This problem compromises our system’s performance. To obtain the complete set of semantic relations that represents the meaning of the given texts, we introduce a new step in our algorithm. 1 After all, the entailment, inference, and equivalence terms","originated from logic. 3. We add semantic axioms to the already created set of world knowledge, NLP, and WordNet-based lexical chain (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002) axioms that assist the logic prover in its search for proofs. We developed semantic axioms that show how two semantic relations can be combined. This will allow the logic prover to combine, whenever possible, semantic instances in order to infer new semantic relationships. The instances of relations that participate in semantic combinations can be either provided by the text or annotated between WordNet synsets. We also exploit other sources of semantic information from the text. For example, the frames encoded in the text sentence provide information which complements the meaning given by the semantic relations. Our second type of axioms derive semantic relations between the frame elements of a given FrameNet frame.","We claim that the process of applying the semantic axioms, given the semantic relations detected by a semantic parser, will capture the complete semantic information expressed by a text fragment. In this paper, we show the usefulness of this procedure for the RTE task, but we are convinced that it can be used by any system which plans to extract the entire semantic information from a given text. 4. We load the COGEX logic prover (Moldovan et al., 2003) which operates by reductio ad absurdum with H’s negated form and T ’s predicates. These clauses are weighted in the order in which they should be chosen to participate in the search. To ensure that H will be the last clause to participate, we assign it the largest value. The logic prover searches for new inferences that can be made using the smallest weight clauses. It also assigns a value to each inference based on the axiom it used to derive it. This process continues until the set of clauses is empty. If a refutation is found, the proof is complete. If a contradiction cannot be found, then the predicate arguments are relaxed and, if the argument relaxation fails, then predicates are dropped until a proof by refutation is found. Its score will be computed by deducting points for each argument relaxation and predicate removal. If this value falls below a threshold, then T does not entail H. Otherwise, the (T, H) pair is a true entailment.","We present a textual entailment example to show the steps of our approach.

Let the text T be John and his son, George, emigrated with Mike, John’s uncle, to US in 1969 and the entailed hypothesis H George and his relative, Mike, came to America. Our system transforms each text into its corresponding semantically enhanced logic form (LF T and LF H in Table 1). Then, the logic prover uses the newly added semantic axioms to derive extra semantic information from T and H (for example, George and Mike are relatives, but T does not explicitly specify this), after another preprocessing step which identies the frame elements of each frame encoded in the two texts (TDeparting, TKinship, HArriving, HKinship). In our example, the axioms TAxiom1 and TAxiom2 denote the symmetry and the transitivity of the KINSHIP relation. TAxiom3 , TAxiom4 and HAxiom1 are the frame-related axioms used by the logic prover. The TSemantics and HSemantics rows (Table 1) summarize the meaning of T and H. We note that half of these semantic instances were extracted using the semantic axioms. Once the lexical chains between the concepts in T and the ones from H are computed, the entailment becomes straightforward. We represented, graphically, the meaning of the two texts in Figure 1. We also show the links between the analogous concepts that help prove the entailment.","In the coming sections of the paper, we detail the process of semantic axiom generation.

Individual lexical units point to specic frames and establish a binding pattern to specic elements within the frame. FrameNet describes the underlying frames for different lexical units and examines sentences related to the frames using the BNC corpus. The result is an XML database that 9 http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu contains a set of frames, a set of frame elements for each frame, and a set of frame annotated sentences. 4.1 Frame-based semantic axioms With respect to a given target, the frame elements contribute to the understanding of the sentence. But they only link each argument to the target word (for example, THM(theme, target) or AGT(theme, target), LOC(place, target), etc.). Often enough, we can nd relations between the frame elements of a given frame. These new instances of semantic relations take as arguments the frame elements of a certain frame, when they are expressed in the text. For example, given the DEPARTING frame, we can say that the origin of the theme is the source (SRC(theme, source)) and that the new location of the theme is the goal frame element (LOC(theme, goal)). Moreover, if the text species the cotheme frame element, then we can make similar statements about it (SRC(cotheme, source) and LOC(cotheme, goal)). These new relation instances increase the semantic information that can be derived from text.","So far, we manually inspected 54 frames and analyzed the relationships between their frame elements by examining their denitions and the annotated corpus provided with the FrameNet data. For each frame, we retained only the rules independent of the 375 CLOTHING PARTS F → PW(subpart, clothing) CLOTHING PARTS F → PW(material, subpart) Example: Hello, Hank they said from the depths of the [fur]Material [collars]Subpart,Target of [their]Wearer [coats]Clothing.

We identied 132 semantic axioms that hold in most cases10",". We show some examples in Table 4. 4.2 Context importance There are cases when the rules that we identied should not be applied. Let’s examine the sentence John intends to leave the kitchen. If we consider only the DEPARTING frame and its corresponding rules, without looking at the context, then our conclusions (¬ LOC(J ohn, kitchen) and SRC(J ohn, kitchen)) will be false. This sentence states an intention of motion, not the actual action. Therefore, our semantic axioms apply only when the context they are in, allows it. To overcome this problem, we do not apply the axioms for target words found in planning contexts, contexts related to be-liefs, intentions, desires, etc. As an alternative, we keep track of plans, intentions, desires, etc. and, if, later on, we conrm them, then we apply the semantic axioms. Also, when we analyze a sentence, the frame whose rules we apply needs to be chosen carefully. For example, in the sentence [A boat]Agent [carrying]T arget [would-be Moroccan illegal emigrants]T heme [from UK]P ath start [to Spain ]P ath end sank in the Strait of Gibraltar on June 8, the CARRYING frame’s axioms do not apply. The boat nor the emigrants reach Spain (the path end of 10 Section 4.2 lists some exception cases. the motion) because the boat sank. Here, the rules given by sink.v’s frame should be given priority over the carry.v’s rules. We can generalize and conclude that, given a sentence that contains more than one target (therefore, maybe multiple frames), the dominant frame, the one whose rules should be applied, is the frame given by the predicative verb. In the previous sentence, the dominant frame is the one given by sink.v and its rules should be applied before the axioms of the CARRYING frame. It should be noted that some of the axioms semantically related to the CARRYING frame still apply (for example, SRC(emigrants, U K) or SRC(boat, U K)). Unlike LOC(emigrants, Spain), the previous relations do not conict with the semantics given by sink.v and its location (the Strait of Gibraltar)."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Results 5.1 The","paragraphs":["RTE data The benchmark corpus for the RTE task consists of seven subsets with a 50%-50% split between the positive entailment examples and the negative ones.

The system participating in the RTE competition used a set of world-knowledge, NLP, and lexical chain-based axioms and an in-house logic prover which received as input the logic forms of the two texts enhanced with semantic relation instances. Because the state-of-the-art semantic parsers cannot extract the complete semantic information encoded in text, the need for semantic calculus in NLP be-came evident. We introduce semantic axioms that either combine two semantic instances or label relations between the frame elements of a given frame. Preliminary statistical results show that incorporat-ing semantic rules into the logic prover can double the semantic connectivity between the concepts of the analyzed text. Our process of identifying more semantic instances leads to a smaller dependency of the logic-based RTE system on world knowledge axioms, while improving its overall accuracy."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Collin Baker, Fillmore Charles, and John Love. 1998.
