A common filtering approach is adapting existing text classification/retrieval algorithms to classify incoming documents as either relevant or non relevant using user profiles learned from explicit user feedback on documents the user has seen. However, there are other important criteria for the user besides relevance, such as readability (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), novelty (Harman, 2003), and authority (Kleinberg, 1998). Besides, much information about the user and the document can be collected by a filtering system. These suggest a way to improve the current filtering system: going beyond relevance and using multiple forms of evidence.","∗","This research was done while at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.","Unfortunately, there is no standard evaluation data set for this research, and there is not much work on finding a good theory to combine various forms of evidence. To solve the first problem, we designed a user study and collect thousands of cases with multiple forms of evidence, including the content of a document, explicit and implicit user feedback, such as a user’s mouse usage, key board usage, document length, novelty, relevance, readability, authority, user profile characteristics, news source information, and whether a user likes a document or not. Solving the second problem is very challenging. A good model should have the representation power to combine multiple forms of evidence; it should be able to help us understand the relationships between various forms of evidence; it should use the evidence to improve filtering system performance; and it should handle various problems like missing data in an operational environment robustly.","On the other hand, researchers have identified three major advantages of graphical modeling approach: 1) it provides inference tools to naturally handle situations of missing data entry because of the conditional dependencies encoded in the graph structure; 2) it can learn causal relationships in the domain, thus help us to understand the problem and to predict the consequences of interven-tion; and 3) it can easily combine prior knowledge (such as partial information about the causal relationship) with data in this framework. This approach has been applied to model computer software users (Horvitz et al., 1998), car drivers (Pynadath and Wellman, 1995), and students (Conati et al., 1997). Motivated by the prior work, we choose to use graphical models as our solution. To understand relationships between various forms of evidence, we use the causal graph structure learning algorithms (advantage 2), together with some prior knowledge of the domain (advantage 3), to derive the causal relationships between different user feedback, actions and user context. To improve the existing filtering system, especially in the situation of missing data, we use statistical inference tools to predict how a user will like a document, using information available in different missing evidence situations (advantage 1).

Out of the 7991 entries, only 4522 (57%) entries contain no missing value. The missing rate of each form of evidence is also reported in the tables. There are several reasons for missing data. For example, the explicit feedback is missing because users didn’t always follow instructions, the relevance score is missing for the first story in a class, and the topic f amiliar bef ore values for many topics are missing because we only collected the topic specific answers for larger topics. We expect missing data to be common in operational environments.","The correlation coefficient between each evidence and the explicit feedback user likes is also listed (corr).

However, in order to better understand the underlying truth of the domain, we need to go beyond correlation and uncover the causal relationships between different variables.","To do that, we first specify N nodes, one for each form of evidence to be included in the model. Then PC algorithm is used (Spirtes et al., 2000) to search the causal relationships between multiple forms of evidence from the data collected. To make the search space smaller, some prior domain knowledge, such as forbidden edges, required edges or temporal tiers, can be introduced before searching. In our experiments, we manually specified some prior knowledge based on the first authors’ experience and intuition as the following 5-tier temporal tier: 5","1) T opic inf o = (familiar topic before), RSS inf o =(RSS link, host link), document length (doc len); 2) hidden criteria, such as relevant, novel, authoritative, and readable; 3) system generated scores, such as relevance score and readability score; 4) user likes; 5) user actions, such as seconds spent on a page (TimeOnPage) or the number of clicks on the ↓ key (NumOfDownArrow). This informs the learning algorithm that → from a higher level to lower level is prohibited.","It is very encouraging to see that the structure learned automatically looks reasonable (Figure 4). Accord-ing to the graph, novel, relevant, authoritative, readabilty of a document and whether a user is familiar with the topic before using the system (f amilar topic bef ore) are direct causes of the user’s preference for a document (user likes) . How familiar with this topic a user is before participating the study (topic f amiliar bef ore) and the number of web links to the news source (RSS link) directly affect the user’s relevant and authoritative feedback and readability score. Relevant, authoritative, f amiliar topic bef ore and host link influence a user’s actions, such as the EventOnScroll.","Comparing Tables 2 to 5 with Figure 4, one may ask why some variables are correlated with user likes although there is no direct links between them and user likes. For example, why the correlation between relevance score and user likes is 0.39, while there is no direct link between them. Does Figure 4 contradict Table 5? The answer is “no”. In fact the indirect causal relationship between them tells us why relevance score and user likes are correlated: relevance score and user likes have a common cause relevant. Most of the refined actions, such as the number of pressing page up key (N umOf P ageU p), are far away from user likes. This implies that these refined actions are not very informative if we want to use the learned model to predict whether a user likes a document or not. This finding agree with (Claypool et al., 2001) and Table 2.","The node authoritative is directly linked to readability score and host link.

They suggest the difficulty to understand a page may make the user feel it is not authoritative. Further investigation shows that although the percentage of un-authoritative news is less than 15% in general, among the 187 news stories some users identified as “difficult” using class labels, 73% were also rated as not authoritative. Besides some successful web page authority algorithms that only use hyper links, the estimation of authority may be further improved using the content of a page.","There are links among relevant, novel, readable and authoritative. Although the algorithm failed to tell the causal direction between some pairs of variables, it suggests that the four variables influence each other. This may be an inherent property of the document; or because a user is likely to rate one aspect of the document higher than he/she should if the other aspects are good.","One may ask why the structure in Figure 4 contains no link between readable and readability score, since intuitively it should exist. To answer this question, one needs to understand that the causal relationships learned automatically are what the algorithm “believes” based on the evidence of the data, the assumptions it makes, and the prior constraints we engineered. They may have errors, because the data is noisy, or the assumptions and the prior constraints may be wrong. For example, the PC algorithm do statistical test about the independence relationships among variables using the data and the final results are subject to the error of the statistical test. The PC algorithm assumes no hidden variables, however besides relevant, novel, authoritative, and readable, other hidden variables, such as whether a document is up-to-date, interesting, misleading, etc. (Schamber and Bateman, 1996), may exist and influence a user’s preference for a document. Thus it is not surprising that some of the causal relationships, such as the link between readable and readability score, are missed in the final graph because of the limitation of the learning algorithms. The model learned only sheds some light on the relationships between the variables instead of uncovering the whole truth. It only serves as a starting point for us. To further understand the domain, we may want to break down some variables in the current graph further and relate them to either the user or document properties. In general, causal discovery is inherently difficult and far from solved."]},{"title":"5 Improving system performance using inference algorithms","paragraphs":["A primary task of a filtering system is to predict user preference (user likes) for a document so that the system can decide whether to deliver it to the user.

Doing inference over the causal structure learned in the previous section is difficult because of the circles and a mixture of directed and undirected links on the graph. So, we tried the following directed acyclic graphical models.","GM complete, an almost complete Bayesian network: In this graph, we order the nodes from top to bottom, and the parents of a node are all the nodes above it, such as in Figure 5. For this structure, the order of the nodes is not very important when using Gaussian distributions.","GM causal, a graphical model inspired by causal models: We manually modify the causal structure in Figure 4 to make it a directed acyclic graph as in Figure 6.","In the graphs, RSS info=(RSS link, host link) and Topic info=topic familiar before, topic like) are 2 dimensional vectors representing the information about the news source and the topic in Table 4 and Table 3. actions = (T imeOnP age, ...) is a 12 dimensional vector representing the user actions in Table 1. user likes is the target variable the system wants to predict.","Before learning the parameters of the model, we need to choose a specific conditional form for the probability function associated with each node. We chose Gaussian distributions. If the parents of node X are Y, P (X|Y ) = N (m + W × Y, Σ), where N (μ, Σ) is a gaussian distribution with mean μ and covariance Σ. This is a commonly used distribution for continuous valued nodes. It assumes the joint distribution of these variables is multivariate Gaussian, which may be wrong. Nevertheless, because of the mathematical convenience, the existence of efficient learning and inference algorithms for Gaussian networks, and the availability of modeling tools, we chose this distribution. Using the BNT Toolbox (Murphy, 2001), the maximum likelihood estimations of the parameters (m, W, Σ) were learned using EM algorithm and junction tree inference engine(Cowell et al., 1999) over the graphical models, with whatever information was available on the first 2/3 of the data.","An alternative approach to combine multiple forms of evidence is linear regression. We tried two special methods to solve the missing evidence problem while using linear regression: 1) building a model that does not use the evidence that is missing for each missing situation (LR different); or 2)mean substitution: replacing each missing value for an evidence with the average of the Figure 7: Comparison of the prediction power of different models using 7952 cases for evaluation.

LR different models were only trained with features that are also provided at testing time, so there is one model per testing condition. 6","The results show that GM complete performs similarly to LR different. This is not surprising. Theoretically, if there is no missing entries in training data, GM complete’s estimation of the conditional distribution of P (user likes|available evidence) would be the same as that of LR different on a testing case with missing evidence.","Comparing the correlation coefficients under different testing conditions when using LR different or GM complete, we can see that as more forms of evidence are available, the performance improves. If only the news source information of a document (RSS inf o) is given, all models perform poorly. The readability score improves the system performance significantly. This is nice and interesting, because the evidence is user independent and can be estimated efficiently for each document. The performance keeps improving as topic inf o and relevance score were added. To collect them, we needs user feedback on previous documents. The performance improvement is not very obvious with actions added. This means that given other evidence (RSS inf o, topic inf o, relevance score and readability score), the system won’t improve its prediction of the document much by observing these actions. However, this is only true when we use a model learned for all users and other forms of evidence are available. It does not mean the actions are useless if we learn user specific model, or if other forms of evidence (such as relevance score) are not available.

We may answer this question better by comparing the underlying assumptions of these algorithms. GM complete only assumes the joint distribution of all variables is multivariate Gaussian. GM causal makes much stronger independence assumptions by removing some links between variables.

Further analysis about the +actions runs shows that LR mean gave explicit feedback too much weight and overlooked other less strong evidence. At testing time, it did not handle the problem of missing explicit feedback well and thus performed poorly. Although GM complete also gave very high weights to explicit feedback, it could infer the missing values based on other available evidence at testing time, thus performed better than LR mean. LR different didn’t consider explicit feedback for training, thus it didn’t over-look other forms of evidence and suffer from the problem less. LR mean may work reasonably if explicit variables are not included, however the large difference on how informative each evidence is will still hurt the performance of LR mean to some extent when some strong evidence is missing.

We noticed that an independent work uses a different graphical modeling approach, dependency network, to understand the relationships between implicit measures and explicit satisfaction while user were conducting their web searches and viewing results, and then uses decision tree to predict user satisfaction with results (Fox et al., 2005). Our work differs from the previous work in the goal of the task, the range of evidence considered, the modeling approach we took, and the findings reached.","There has been a lot of related research on using implicit feedback (Kelly and Teevan, 2003). The user actions we collected are based on (Claypool et al., 2001). There is much work about how to handle missing data. (Schafer and Graham, 2002) discussed several approaches such as case deletion, mean substitution, and recommended maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian multiple imputation (MI). LR mean uses mean substitu-tion, LR different uses case deletion, and graphical models follow the ML approach.","There has been some research on criteria beyond topic relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) (Zhang et al., 2002) (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004) (Kleinberg, 1998). (Schamber and Bateman, 1996) identified criteria underlying users’ relevance judgements and explored how users employed the criteria in making evaluations by asking users to interpret and sort criteria independent of document manually. In the literature, the word “relevant” is used ambiguously, either as a narrow definition of “related to the matter at hand (aboutness)” or a broader definition of “having the ability to satisfy the needs of the user”. When it is used by the second definition, such as in (Schamber and Bateman, 1996), researchers are usually studying what we refer to as user likes. In this paper, we use “relevant” as is defined in the first definition and use the phrase “user likes” for the second definition. Despite the vocabulary difference, our work is motivated by the early research. The major contributions of our work in this area are: 1) we model the user likes and other criteria as hidden variables; 2) we quantify the importance of various criteria based on probabilistic reasoning; and 3) we have explored the new methodology for combining these criteria with implicit and explicit user feedback."]},{"title":"7 CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["We have explored how to combine multiple forms of evidence using the graphical modeling approach. This work is significant because it addresses some long-standing is-sues in the adaptive information filtering community: the integration of a wider range of user-specific and user-independent evidence, and handling situations like missing data that occur in operational environments.","We have analyzed the user study data using graphical models, as well as linear regression algorithms. The experimental results show that the graphical modeling approach can help us to understand the causal relationships between multiple forms of evidence in the domain and explain the real world scenario better. It can also help the filtering system to predict user preference more accurately with multiple forms of evidence compared to using a relevance model only.","As more forms of evidence are added, missing data is a common problem because of system glitches or because users will not behave as desired. A real system needs to handle missing data by either ignoring it or by estimat-ing it based on what is known. The graphical modeling approach addresses this problem naturally. LR different handles the problem by building many different models to be used at different data missing conditions. LR different and GM complete perform similarly.

However, as more forms of evidence are added, a more powerful model, such as GM complete, may be preferred because of the computation and space efficiency.","We only collected data for documents users clicked. Further investigation is needed to look at data not clicked, which is a critical step to see whether the improvement on prediction accuracy of user preference will help the system serve the user better in a real system. This is the first step towards using graphical models to combine multiple forms of evidence while filtering. The proposed solution, especially the data analyzing methodology used in this paper, can also be used in other IR tasks besides filtering, such as context-based retrieval."]},{"title":"8 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Jaime Carbonell, Tom Minka, Stephen Robertson, Yiming Yang, Wei Xu, Peter Spirtes, Diane Kelley, Paul Ogilvie, Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Luo Si, Joemon Jose for valuable discussions about the work described in this paper.","This research was funded in part by a fellowship from IBM and a grant from National Science Foundation.
