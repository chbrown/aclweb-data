Translating them correctly will improve the performance of cross-lingual information retrieval, question answering and machine translation systems. However, these key phrases are often domain-specific, and people con-  1 Some name and terminology is a single word, which could be regarded as a one-word phrase. stantly create new key phrases which are not covered by existing bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora, therefore standard data-driven or knowledge-based machine translation systems cannot translate them correctly.","As an increasing amount of web information be-comes available, exploiting such a huge information resource is becoming more attractive. (Resnik 1999) searched the web for parallel corpora while (Lu et al. 2002) extracted translation pairs from anchor texts pointing to the same webpage. However, parallel webpages or anchor texts are quite limited, and these approaches greatly suffer from the lack of data.","However, there are many web pages containing useful bilingual information where key phrases and their translations both occur. See the example in Figure 1. This example demonstrates web page snippets2","containing both a Chinese key phrase “浮 士德” and its translation, “Faust”.","We thus can transform the translation problem into a data mining problem by retrieving these mixed-language web pages and extracting their translations. We propose a new framework to mine key phrase translations from web corpora. Given a source key phrase (here a Chinese phrase), we first retrieve web page snippets containing this phrase using the Google search engine. We then expand queries by adding the translations of topic-relevant hint words from the returned snippets. We submit the source key phrase and expanded queries again to Google to retrieve mixed-language web page snippets. Finally, we extract the key phrase translation from the second-round returned snippets with phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features."," 2 A snippet is a sentence or paragraph containing the key phrase, returned with the web page URLs. 483              ","","Figure 1.

Both results are significantly better than several existing methods. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: cross-lingual query expansion is discussed in section 2; key phrase translation extraction is addressed in section 3. In section 4 we present experimental results, which is followed by relevant works and conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Retrieving Web Page Snippets through Cross-lingual Query Expansion","paragraphs":["For a Chinese key phrase f, we want to find its translation e from the web, more specifically, from the mixed-language web pages or web page snippets containing both f and e. As we do not know e, we are unable to directly retrieve such mixed-language web page using (f,e) as the query.                            ","Figure 2. Returned mixed-language web page snippets using cross-lingual query expansion","However, we observed that when the author of a web page lists both f and e in a page, it is very likely that f' and e' are listed in the same page, where f’ is a Chinese hint word topically relevant to f, and e’ is f’s translation. Therefore if we know a Chinese hint word f’, and we know its reliable translation, e’, we can send (f, e’) as a query to retrieve mixed language web pages containing (f, e).","For example, to find web pages which contain translations of “ 浮士德”(Faust), we expand the query to “浮士德+goethe” since “歌德” (Goethe) is the author of “浮士德”(Faust). Figure 2 illustrates retrieved web page snippets with expanded queries. We find that newly returned snippets contain more correct translations with higher ranks. To propose a “good” English hint e' for f, first we need to find a Chinese hint word f' that is relevant to f. Because f is often an OOV word, it is unlikely that such information can be obtained from existing Chinese monolingual corpora. Instead, we 484 query Google for web pages containing f. From the returned snippets we select Chinese words f' based on the following criteria: ","1. f' should be relevant to f based on the cooccurrence frequency. On average, 300 Chinese words are returned for each query f. We only consider those words that occur at least twice to be relevant.","2. f' can be reliably translated given the current bilingual resources (e.g. the LDC Chinese-English lexicon 3","with 81,945 translation entries).","3. The meaning of f' should not be too ambiguous. Words with many translations are not used.","4. f' should be translated into noun or noun phrases. Given the fact that most OOV words are noun or noun phrases, we ignore those source words which are translated into other part-of-speech words. The British National Corpus4","is used to generate the English noun lists. ","For each f, the top Chinese words f' with the","highest frequency are selected. Their correspond-","ing translations are then used as the cross-lingual","hint words for f. For example, for OOV word f =","浮士德 (Faust), the top candidate f's are “歌德","(Goethe)”, “ 介简 (introduction)”, “ 文学","(literature)” and “悲剧(tragedy)”. We expand","the original query “ 浮士德” to “ 浮士德+","goethe”, “浮士德 + introduction”, “浮士德 + lit-","erature”, “浮士德 + tragic”, and then query Google","again for web page snippets containing the correct","translation “Faust”."]},{"title":"3 Extracting Key Phrase Translation","paragraphs":["When the Chinese key phrase and its English hint words are sent to Google as the query, returned web page snippets contain the source query and possibly its translation.

Replace punctuation marks with phrase separator ‘|’;","5. Replace non-query Chinese words with placeholder mark ‘+’, as they indicate the distance between an English phrase and the Chinese key phrase. For example, the snippet 《 <b> 廊桥遗梦</b> 》 (the bridges of madison county)[review]. 发布者:anjing | 发布时间:2004-01-25 星期日 02:13 | 最 新更新时间 is converted into | <b> 廊 桥 遗 梦 </b> | the_bridges_of_Madison_county | review | ++ + | anjing | ++ ++ | 2004-01-25 +++ 02 13 | + + ++ ++, where “<b>” and “</b>” mark the start and end positions of the Chinese key phrase. The candidate English phrases, “the bridges of madison county”, “review” and “anjing”, will be aligned to the source key phrase according to a combined feature set using a transliteration model which captures the pronunciation similarity, a translation model which captures the semantic similarity and a frequency-distance model reflecting their relevancy. These models are described below. 3.1 Transliteration Model The transliteration model captures the phonetic similarity between a Chinese phrase and an English translation candidate via string alignment. Many key phrases are person and location names, which are phonetically translated and whose written forms resemble their pronunciations. Therefore it is possible to discover these translation pairs through their surface strings. Surface string transliteration does not need a pronunciation lexicon to map words into phoneme sequences; thus it is especially appealing for OOV word translation. For non-Latin languages like Chinese, a romanization 485 script called “pinyin” maps each Chinese character into Latin letter strings. This normalization makes the string alignment possible. We adopt the transliteration model proposed in (Huang, et al. 2003). This model calculates the probabilistic Levinstein distance between a romanized source string and a target string. Unlike the traditional Levinstein distance calculation, the character alignment cost is not binary (0/1); rather it is the logarithm of character alignment probability, which ensures that characters with similar pronunciations (e.g. p̀̀and b̀)̀ have higher alignment probabilities and lower cost. These probabilities are automatically learned from bilingual name lists using EM.","Assume the Chinese phrase f has J Chinese characters, , and the English candidate phrase e has L English words, . The transliteration cost between a Chinese query and an English translation candidate is calculated as: Jfff ,..., 21 Leee ,...,, 21"]},{"title":"f e  ","paragraphs":["where is the pinyin of Chinese character , is the i th letter in , and and are their aligned English letters, respectively. is the letter transliteration probability.

We selected 310 Chinese key phrases from 12 domains as the test set, which were almost equally distributed within these domains. We also manually translated them as the reference translations. Table 1 shows some typical phrases and their translations, where one may find that correct key phrase translations need both phonetic transliterations and semantic translations. We evaluated inclusion rate, defined as the percentage of correct key phrase translations which can be retrieved in the returned snippets; alignment accuracy, defined as the percentage of key phrase translations which can be correctly aligned given that these translations are included in the snippets; and overall translation accuracy, defined as the percentage of key phrases which can be translated correctly. We compared our approach with the LiveTrans5","(Cheng et.al. 2004) system, an unknown word translator using web corpora, and we observed better translation performance using our approach. 4.1 Query Translation Inclusion Rate In the first round query search, for each Chinese key phrase f, on average 13 unique snippets were returned to identify relevant Chinese hint words f’, and the top 5 f's were selected to generate hint words e’s.

Alignment accuracies using different features"," These search strategies are further discussed in the section 5. 4.2 Translation Alignment Accuracy We evaluated our key phrase extraction model by testing queries whose correct translations were included in the returned snippets. We used different feature combinations on differently sized snippets to compare their alignment accuracies. Table 2 shows the result. Here “Trl” means using the transliteration model, “Trans” means using the translation model, and “Fq-dis” means using Frequency-Distance model. The frequency-distance model seemed to be the strongest single model in both cases (with and without hint words), while incorporating phonetic and semantic features provided additional strength to the overall performance. Combining all three features together yielded the best accuracy. Note that when more candidate translations were available through query expansion, the alignment accuracy improved by 30% relative due to the frequency-distance model. However, using transliteration and/or translation models alone decreased performance because of more incorrect translation candidates from returned snippets. After incorporating the frequency-distance model, correct translations have the maximum frequency-distance weights and are more likely to be selected as the top hypothesis. Therefore the combined model obtained the highest translation accuracy. 4.3 Overall Translation Quality The overall translation qualities are listed in Table 3, where we showed the translation accuracies of ","No Hints (Inc = 44.19%)","With Hints (Inc = 95.16%) Table 3.
