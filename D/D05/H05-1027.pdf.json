While most existing discriminative training methods use a loss function that can be optimized easily but approaches only approximately to the objective of minimum error rate, MSR minimizes the training error directly using a heuristic training procedure. Evaluations on the task of Japanese text input show that MSR can handle a large number of features and training samples; it significantly outperforms a regular trigram model trained using maximum likelihood estimation, and it also outperforms the two widely applied discriminative methods, the boosting and the perceptron algorithms, by a small but statistically significant margin."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Language modeling (LM) is fundamental to a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition and Asian language text input (Jelinek 1997; Gao et al. 2002). The traditional approach uses a parametric model with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), usually with smoothing methods to deal with data sparseness problems. This approach is optimal under the assumption that the true distribution of data on which the parametric model is based is known. Unfortunately, such an assumption rarely holds in realistic applications.","An alternative approach to LM is based on the framework of discriminative training, which uses a much weaker assumption that training and test data are generated from the same distribution but the form of the distribution is unknown. Unlike the traditional approach that maximizes the function (i.e. likelihood of training data) that is loosely as-sociated with error rate, discriminative training methods aim to directly minimize the error rate on training data even if they reduce the likelihood. So, they potentially lead to better solutions. However, the error rate of a finite set of training samples is usually a step function of model parameters, and cannot be easily minimized. To address this problem, previous research has concentrated on the development of a loss function that approximates the exact error rate and can be easily optimized. Though these methods (e.g. the boosting method) have theoretically appealing properties, such as convergence and bounded generalization error, we argue that the approximated loss function may prevent them from attaining the original objective of minimizing the error rate.","In this paper we present a new estimation procedure for LM, called minimum sample risk (MSR). It differs from most existing discriminative training methods in that instead of searching on an approximated loss function, MSR employs a simple heuristic training algorithm that minimizes the error rate on training samples directly. MSR operates like a multidimensional function optimization algorithm: first, it selects a subset of features that are the most effective among all candidate features. The parameters of the model are then optimized iteratively: in each iteration, only the parameter of one feature is adjusted. Both feature selection and parameter optimization are based on the criterion of minimizing the error on training samples. Our evaluation on the task of Japanese text input shows that MSR achieves more than 20% error rate reduction over MLE on two newswire data sets, and it also outperforms the other two widely applied discriminative methods, the boosting method and the perceptron algorithm, by a small but statistically significant margin.","Although it has not been proved in theory that MSR is always robust, our experiments of cross-domain LM adaptation show that it is.

This is the standard method of inputting Chinese or Japanese text by converting the input phonetic symbols into the appropriate word string. In this paper we call the task IME, which stands for input method editor, based on the name of the commonly used Windows-based application.","Performance on IME is measured in terms of the character error rate (CER), which is the number of characters wrongly converted from the phonetic string divided by the number of characters in the correct transcript. Current IME systems make about 5-15% CER in conversion of real data in a wide variety of domains (e.g. Gao et al. 2002).","Similar to speech recognition, IME is viewed as a Bayes decision problem. Let A be the input phonetic string.

Moreover, if we do not take into account typing errors, it is reasonable to assume a unique mapping from W and A in IME, i.e. P(A|W) = 1. So the decision of Equation (1) depends solely upon P(W), making IME a more direct evaluation test bed for LM than speech recognition. Another advantage is that it is easy to convert W to A (for Chinese and Japanese), which enables us to obtain a large number of training data for discriminative learning, as described later.","The values of P(W) in Equation (1) are traditionally calculated by MLE: the optimal model parameters λ*","are chosen in such a way that P(W|λ*",") is maximized on training data. The arguments in favor of MLE are based on the assumption that the form of the underlying distributions is known, and that only the values of the parameters characterizing those distributions are unknown. In using MLE for LM, one always assumes a multinomial distribution of language. For example, a trigram model makes the assumption that the next word is predicted depending only on two preceding words. However, there are many cases in natural language where words over an arbitrary distance can be related. MLE is therefore not optimal because the assumed model form is incorrect.","What are the best estimators when the model is known to be false then? In IME, we can tackle this question empirically. Best IME systems achieve the least CER. Therefore, the best estimators are those which minimize the expected error rate on unseen test data. Since the distribution of test data is unknown, we can approximately minimize the error rate on some given training data (Vapnik 1999). Toward this end, we have developed a very simple heuristic training procedure called minimum sample risk, as presented in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Minimum Sample Risk 3.1 Problem Definition","paragraphs":["We follow the general framework of linear discriminant models described in (Duda et al. 2001).

First, there exists an implementation of line search that optimizes the function along one direction efficiently. Second, the number of candidate features is not too large, and these features are not highly correlated. However, neither of the assumptions holds in our case. First of all, Er(.) in Equation (4) is a step function of λ, thus cannot be optimized directly by regular gradient-based procedures – a grid search has to be used instead. However, there are problems with simple grid search: using a large grid could miss the optimal solution whereas using a fine-grained grid would lead to a very slow algorithm.

See (Suzuki and Gao 2005) for a detailed report.","The data sets we used stem from five distinct sources of text. The Nikkei newspaper corpus described in Section 4.1 was used as the background domain, on which the word trigram model was trained.

First of all, in all four adaptation domains, discriminative methods outperform MAP significantly. Secondly, the improvement margins of discriminative methods over MAP correspond to the similarities between background domain and adaptation domains. When the two domains are very similar to the background domain (such as Yomiuri), discriminative methods outperform MAP by a large margin. However, the margin is smaller when the two domains are substantially different (such as Encarta and Shincho). The phenomenon is attributed to the underlying difference between the two adaptation methods: MAP aims to improve the likelihood of a distribution, so if the adaptation domain is very similar to the background domain, the difference between the two underlying distributions is so small that MAP cannot adjust the model effectively. However, discriminative methods do not have this limitation for they aim to reduce errors directly. Finally, we find that in most adaptation test sets, MSR achieves slightly better CER results than the two competing discriminative methods. Specifically, the improvements of MSR are statistically significant over the boosting method in three out of four domains, and over the perceptron algorithm in the Yomiuri domain. The results demonstrate again that MSR is robust."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Discriminative models have recently been proved to be more effective than generative models in some NLP tasks, e.g., parsing (Collins 2000), POS tagging (Collins 2002) and LM for speech recognition (Roark et al. 2004).

One of the reasons, as pointed out by Ng and Jordan (2002), is that the parameters of a discriminative model can be fit either to maximize the conditional likelihood on training data, or to minimize the training errors. Since the latter optimizes the objective function that the system is graded on, it is viewed as being more truly in the spirit of discriminative learning.","The MSR method shares the same motivation: to minimize the errors directly as much as possible. Because the error function on a finite data set is a step function, and cannot be optimized easily, previous research approximates the error function by loss functions that are suitable for optimization (e.g. Collins 2000; Freund et al. 1998; Juang et al. 1997; Duda et al. 2001).

It is a simple heuristic training procedure to minimize training errors directly without applying any approximated loss function.","MSR shares many similarities with previous methods. The basic training algorithm described in Section 3.2 follows the general framework of multidimensional optimization (e.g., Press et al. 1992). The line search is an extension of that described in (Och 2003; Quirk et al. 2005. The extension lies in the way of handling large number of features and training samples. Previous algorithms were used to optimize linear models with less than 10 features. The feature selection method described in Section 3.4 is a particular implementation of the feature selection methods described in (e.g., Theodoridis and Koutroumbas 2003). The major difference between the MSR and other methods is that it estimates the effectiveness of each feature in terms of its expected training error reduction while previous methods used metrics that are loosely coupled with reducing training errors. The way of dealing with feature correlations in feature selection in Equation (7), was suggested by Finette et al. (1983)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We show that MSR is a very successful discriminative training algorithm for LM. Our experiments suggest that it leads to significantly better conversion performance on the IME task than either the MLE method or the two widely applied discriminative methods, the boosting and perceptron methods. However, due to the lack of theoretical underpinnings, we are unable to prove that MSR will always succeed. This forms one area of our future work.","One of the most interesting properties of MSR is that it can optimize any objective function (whether its gradient is computable or not), such as error rate in IME or speech, BLEU score in MT, precision and recall in IR (Gao et al. 2005). In particular, MSR can be performed on large-scale training set with millions of candidate features. Thus, another area of our future work is to test MSR on wider varieties of NLP tasks such as parsing and tagging."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Collins, Michael. 2002.
