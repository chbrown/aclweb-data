Simple keyword-based Information Retrieval do not capture the relationships in the data, which are needed to answer the complex needs of the users. We therefore augment keywords with information extracted through natural language processing and business intelligence tools. As opposed to most systems, this information is used at all stages in the back-end and interface. The benets are twofold: rst we obtain higher precision of search and classication, and second the user gains access to a deeper level of information.","Two challenges are: how to discover new CFT and related documents on the Web, and how to extract information from these documents, knowing that the Web offers no guarantee on the structure and stability of those documents. A major hurdle to the discovery of new documents is the poor degree of linkedness between businesses, and the open topic area, which makes topic-focused Web crawling (Aggarwal et al., 2001) unapplicable. To extract information, wrappers (Soderland, 1999), i.e. tools that can recognise textual and/or structural patterns, have limited success because of the diversity and volatility of Web documents.","Since we cannot assume a structure for documents, we exploit information usually contained in CFTs: contracting authority, opening/closing date, location, legal notices, conditions of submission, classication, etc. These can appear marked up with tags or as free-text.","A rst type of information to extract are the socalled named entities (Maynard et al., 2001), i.e. names of people, organisations, locations, time or quantities. To these standard entities we add some application-specic entities such as FAR (regulation number), product dimensions, etc. To extract named entities we use Nstein NFinderTM",", which uses a combination of lexical rules and a dictionary. More details about the entities, statistics and results can be found in (Paradis and Nie, 2005a).","We use another tool, Nstein NconceptTM",", to extract concepts, which capture the themes or relevant phrases in a document. NConcept uses a combination of statistics and linguistic rules.","As mentioned above, CFTs not only contains information about the subject of the tender, but also procedural and regulation information. We tag passages in the document as subject or non-subject, according to the presence or absence of the most discriminant bigrams. Some heuristics are also applied to use the good predictors such as URL and money, or to further rene the non-subject passages into regulation. More details can be found in (Paradis and Nie, 2005b).","Another information to extract is the industry or service, according to a classication schema such as NAICS (North American Industry Classication System) or CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary). We perform multi-schema, multi-label classication, which facilitates use across economic zones (for instance, an American user may not be familiar with CPV, a European standard) and confusion over schemas versions (NAICS version 1997/Canada vs. NAICS version 2002). Our classier is a simple Naive Bayes, trained over 20,000 documents gathered from an American Government tendering site, FBO (Federal Business Opportunities). Since we have found classication to be sensitive to the pres-30 ence of procedural contents, we remove non-subject passages, as tagged above. The resulting performance is 61% micro-F1 (Paradis and Nie, 2005b).","Finally, a second level of extraction is performed to infer information about organisations: their contacts, business relationships, spheres of activities, average size of contract, etc. This is refered to as business intelligence (Betts, 2003). For this extraction we not only use CFTs, but also awards (i.e. past information about successful bids) and news (i.e. articles published about an organisation). For news, we collect co-occurences of entities and classify them using a semantic network. For example, the passage Sun vs. Microsoft is evidence towards the two companies being competitors.","The extracted information is indexed and queried using Apache Lucene., with a Web front-end served by Jakarta Turbine. The interface was designed to help the user make the most of the extracted information, whether in query formulation, document perusing, or navigation.","Our system supports precise queries by indexing free-text and extracted information separately. For example, the simple keyword query bush returns all documents where the word occurs, including documents about bush trimming and president Bush, while the query person:Bush only returns documents about President Bush. However such queries are not very user-friendly. We thus provide an interface for advanced queries and query renement.","The extracted information from the 100 top query results is gathered and presented in small scrollable lists, one for each entity type. For example, starting with keyword bush, the user sees a list of people in the person box, and could choose Bush to rene her query. The list is also used to expand the query with a related concept (for example, removal services is suggested for snow), the expansion of an acronym, etc.","Queries can be automatically translated using Cross-Language Information Retrieval techniques (Peters et al., 2003). To this end we have built a statistical translation model trained from a collection of 100,000 French-English pair documents from a European tendering site, TED (Tenders Electronic Daily). Two dictionaries were built: one with simple terms, and one with concepts, extracted as above. The intuition is that simple terms will offer better recall while concepts will give better precision.","The interface shows and allows navigation to the extracted information. When viewing a CFT, the user can highlight the entities, as well as the subject and regulation passages. She can also click on an organisation to get a company prole, which shows the business intelligence attributes as well as related documents such as past awards or news.","We are currently expanding the business intelligence functionalities, and implementing user proles, which will save contextual or background information and use it transparently to affect querying."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This project was nanced jointly by Nstein Technologies and NSERC."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Charu C.
