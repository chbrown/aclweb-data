The previous approaches use limited information to solve the ambiguity – four lexical heads – although humans disambiguate much better when the full sentence is available. We propose to solve the PP-attachment ambiguity with a Support Vector Machines learning model that uses complex syntactic and semantic features as well as unsupervised information obtained from the World Wide Web. The system was tested on several datasets obtaining an accuracy of 93.62% on a Penn Treebank-II dataset; 91.79% on a FrameNet dataset when no manually-annotated semantic information is provided and 92.85% when semantic information is provided."]},{"title":"1 Problem description 1.1 PP-attachment ambiguity problem","paragraphs":["Prepositional Phrase-attachment is a source of ambiguity in natural language that generates a significant number of errors in syntactic parsing. For example the sentence “I saw yesterday the man in the park with a telescope” has 5 different semantic interpretations based on the way the prepositional phrases “in the park” and “with the telescope” are attached: I saw yesterday [the man [in the park [with a telescope]]]; I saw yesterday [the man [in the park] [with a telescope]]; I saw yesterday [the man [in the park]] [with a telescope]; I saw yesterday [the man] [in the park [with a telescope]] and I saw yesterday [the man] [in the park] [with a telescope].","The problem can be viewed as a decision of attaching a prepositional phrase (PP) to one of the preceding head nouns or verbs. The ambiguity expressed by the number of potential parse trees generated by Context-Free Grammars increases exponentially with the number of PPs. For a PP that follows the object of a verb there are 2 parse trees, for a chain of 2, 3, 4 and 5 PPs there are respectively 5, 14, 42 and 132 parse trees. Usually the average number of consecutive PPs in a sentence increases linearly with the length of the sentence.","Lexical and syntactic information alone is not sufficient to resolve the PP-attachment problem; of-ten semantic and/or contextual information is necessary. For example, in “I ate a pizza with an-chovies”, “with anchovies” attaches to the noun “pizza”, where as in “I ate a pizza with friends.”, “with friends” attaches to the verb “eat” – example found in (McLauchlan, 2001). There are instances of PP-attachment, like the one in “I saw the car in the picture” that can be disambiguated only by using contextual discourse information.","Usually, people don’t have much trouble in finding the right way to attach PPs. But if one limits the information used for disambiguation of the PP-attachment to include only the verb, the noun representing its object, the preposition and the main noun in the PP, the accuracy for human decision degrades from 93.2% to 88.2% (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) on a dataset extracted from Penn Treebank (Marcus et 273 al., 1993). 1.2 Motivation Syntactic parsing is essential for many natural language applications such as Machine Translation, Question Answering, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Automatic Speech Recognition. Since parsing occurs early in the chain of NLP processing steps it has a large impact on the over-all system performance."]},{"title":"2 Approach","paragraphs":["Our approach to solve the PP-attachment ambiguity is based on a Support Vector Machines learner (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The feature set contains complex information extracted automatically from candidate syntax trees generated by parsing (Charniak, 2000), trees that will be improved by more accurate PP-attachment decisions. Some of these features were proven efficient for semantic information labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). The feature set also includes unsupervised information obtained from a very large corpus (World Wide Web). Features containing manually annotated semantic information about the verb and about the objects of the verb have also been used. We adopted the standard approach to distinguish between verb and noun attachment; thus the classifier has to choose between two classes: V when the prepositional phrase is attached to the verb and N when the prepositional phrase is attached to the preceding head noun."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["To be able to extract the required features from a dataset instance, one must identify the verb, the phrase identifying the object of the verb that precedes the prepositional phrase in question (np1) which usually is part of the predicate-argument structure of the verb, its head noun, the prepositional phrase (np2), its preposition and its head noun (the second most important word in the PP).","We have adopted the notation from (Collins and Brooks, 1995), where v is the verb, n1 is the head noun of object phrase, p is the preposition and n2 is the head noun of the prepositional phrase.","Compared to our datasets, Ratnaparkhi’s dataset (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) contains only the lexical heads v, n1, p and n2. Thus, our methodology cannot be applied to Ratnaparkhi’s dataset (RRR).","In our experiments we used two datasets:","• FN – extracted from FrameNet II 1.1 (Baker et al., 1998) • TB2 – extracted from Penn Treebank-II Table 1 presents the datasets1",". The creation of the","datasets is described in details in (Olteanu, 2004)."]},{"title":"4 Features","paragraphs":["The experiments described in this paper use a set of discrete (alphanumeric) and continuous (numeric) features. All features are fully deterministic, except the features count-ratio and pp-count that are based on information provided by an external resource - Google search engine (http://www.google. com).","In describing the features, we will use the Penn Treebank-II parse tree associated with the sentence “The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in “very modest amounts” in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956”.","Table 2 describes the features and the origin of each feature. The preposition is the feature with the most discriminative power, because of preferences of particular prepositions to attach to verbs or nouns. Table 3 shows the distribution of top 10 most frequently used prepositions in the FN and TB2 datasets.","The features were carefully designed so that, when they are extracted from gold parse trees, they don’t provide more information useful for disambiguation than when they are automatically generated using a parser. This claim is validated by the experimental results that show a strong correlation between the results on the two datasets – one based on automatically generated parse trees (FN) and one based on gold parse trees (TB2).","Next, we describe in further detail the features presented in Table 2.","v-frame represents the frame of the verb – the frame to which the verb belongs, as it is present in FrameNet (manually annotated).

This feature was introduced because of the relation between the underlying meaning of np1 and its semantic role.","n1-tr represents the thematic role of the object phrase np1 – a coarse-grained role based on the label attached to the Frame Element (manual semantic annotation that can be found in FrameNet). It was introduced to reduce data sparseness for the n1-sr feature. The conversion from fine-grained semantic role to coarse-grained semantic role is done automatically using a table that maps a pair of a frame-level semantic role (FE label) and a frame to a thematic role.","subcategorization contains a semi-lexicalized description of the structure of the verb phrase. A subcategorization frame is closely related to the 275 predicate argument structure and to the underlying meaning of the verb. It contains an ordered set of all the phrase labels that are siblings of the verb, plus a marker for the verb. If the child phrase of the verb is a PP, then the label will also contain the preposition (the headword of the PP). This feature is a modified form of the sub-categorization feature described in (Pradhan et al., 2003): the differences in various part-of-speeches for the verb were ignored and the preposition that heads a prepositional phrase is also attached to the label. Therefore, for the sentence “The stock declined in June by 4%”, the value for this feature is *-PPin-PPby.","In the TB2 dataset the parse trees are gold standard (contain the expected output value for PP-ambiguity resolution). In the case of a verb attachment, if the selected PP is a child of the selected VP, then by applying the algorithm, the value of the feature will contain the PP label plus the preposition. This clearly is a clue for the learner that the instance is a verb attachment. To overcome this problem for datasets based on gold-standard parse trees, when computing the value of the subcategorization feature the selected PP will not be used. Figure 1 shows the subcategorization for the phrase “replaced with a different type of filter in 1956”. VP replaced PP with NP NP differenta type PP of NP filter PP in NP 1956 Figure 1: Subcategorization feature: *-PPin-PPby","path expresses the syntactic relation between the verb v and the object phrase np1. Its purpose is to describe the syntactic relation of np1 to the rest of the clause by the syntactic relation of np1 with the head of the clause – v. We adopted this feature from (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). path describes the chain of labels in the tree from v to np1, including the label of v and np1. Ascending movements and descending movements are depicted separately. We used two variants of this feature to determine the optimum version for our problem – one with full POS of the verb and one with POS reduced to “VB”. The experiments proved that the second variant provides a better performance. Figure 2 depicts the path between “replaced” and “a different type of filter”: VBN↑VP↓PP↓NP or VB↑VP↓PP↓NP. VP replaced PP with NP NP differenta type PP of NP filter PP in NP 1956 Figure 2: Example of a path feature","position indicates the position of the n1-p-n2 construction relative to the verb, i.e. whether the prepositional phrase in question lies before the verb or after the verb in the sentence. Position is very important in deciding the type of attachment, considering the totally different distribution of PPs constructions preceding the verb and PPs constructions following the verb.","Morphological processing applied to n1 and n2 was inspired by the algorithm described in (Collins and Brooks, 1995). We analyzed the impact of different levels of morphological processing by using two types: partial morphological processing (only numbers and years are converted) – identified by adding -mp as a suffix to the name of this feature – and full morphological processing (numbers, years and capitalized names) – identified by adding -mpf as a suffix to the name of this feature. The purpose of morphological processing is data sparseness reduction by clustering similar values for this feature.","n1-parent represents the phrase label of the parent of np1 and it cannot be used on gold parse trees (TB2 dataset) because it will provide a clue about the correct attachment type. 276","n2-det is called the determination of the prepositional phrase np2. This novel feature tells if n2 is preceded in np2 by a possessive pronoun or by a determiner. This is used to differentiate between “buy books for children” (which is probably a noun attachment) and “buy books for her children” (which very probably is a verb attachment).","parser-vote feature represents the choice of the parser (Charniak’s parser) in the PP-attachment resolution. It cannot be used with gold-standard parse trees because it will provide the right answer.","count-ratio represents the estimated ratio between the frequency of an unambiguous verb attachment construction based on v, p and n2 and the frequency of a probably unambiguous noun attachment construction based on n1, p and n2 in a very large corpus. A very large corpus is required to overcome the data sparseness inherent for complex constructions like those described above.","We chose the World Wide Web as a corpus and Google as a query interface (see (Olteanu, 2004) for details).","Let’s consider the estimated frequency of unambiguous verb-attachments and respectively noun-attachments defined as: fv = cv−p−n2 cv ·cp−n2 fn = cn1−p−n2 cn1 ·cp−n2 where:","• cv−p−n2 is the number of occurrences of the phrase “v p n2”, “v p∗n2” (where * symbolizes any word), “v-lemma p n2” or “v-lemma p * n2” in World Wide Web, as reported by Google","• cv is the number of occurrences of the word “v” or “v-lemma” in WWW","• cp−n2 is the number of occurrences of the phrase “p n2” or “p ∗ n2” in WWW","• cn1−p−n2 is the number of occurrences of the phrase “n1 p n2” or “v p ∗ n2” in WWW","• cn1 is the number of occurrences of the word “n1” in WWW The value for this feature is: count − ratio = log10 fv fn = log10 cv−p−n2 ·cn1 cn1−p−n2 ·cv","We chose logarithmic values for this feature because experiments showed that logarithmic values provide a higher accuracy than linear values. Also, by experimentation we concluded that value bound-ing is helpful, and the feature was bounded to values between -3 and 3 on the logarithmic scale, unless specified otherwise in the experiment description.","This feature resembles the approach adopted in (Volk, 2001).","pp-count depicts the estimated count of occurrences in World Wide Web of the prepositional phrases based on p and n2. The count is estimated by cp−n2. Therefore pp-count = log10(cp−n2 + cp−∗−n2).","n1-p-distance depicts the distance (in tokens) between n1 and p.

This represents an absolute improvement of approximately 6.14%, equivalent to a 49% error drop. The performance of the system on Penn Treebank-II exceeds the reported human expert performance on Penn Treebank-I (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) by about 0.4%. A significant improvement comes from the unsupervised information collected 279 from a very large corpus; this method proved to be efficient to overcome the data sparseness problem.","By analyzing the results from the FrameNet dataset, we conclude that the contribution of the gold semantic features (frame and semantic role) is significant (1.05% difference in accuracy; 12.8% reduction in the error). We will further investigate this issue by replacing gold semantic information with automatically detected semantic information. Our additional lexico-syntactic features increase the accuracy of the system from 86.44% to 89.61% for PPs following the verb. This suggests that on the FrameNet dataset the proposed syntactic features have a considerable impact on the accuracy.","The best TB2 feature set is approximately the same as the best FN feature set in spite of the differences between the datasets (Parse trees: TB2 – gold standard; FN – automatically generated. PP-attachment ambiguity identification: TB2 – parse trees; FN – a combination of trees and FE annotation. Data source: TB2 – WSJ articles; FN – BNC). This fact suggests that the selected feature sets do not exploit particularities of the datasets and that the features are relevant to the PP-attachment ambiguity problem."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Steven Abney, Robert E.
