Vladu=z","Institute for Scientific Information 3501 Market S~reet, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 USA ABSTRACT","The nature of the problem and earlier approaches to the automatic compilation of printed subject indexes are reviewed and illustrated. A simple method is described for the de~ection of semantically self-contained word phrase segments in title-like texts. The method is based on a predetermined list of acceptable types of nominative syntactic patterns which can be recognized using a small domain-independent dictionary. The transformation of the de~ected word phrases into subject index records is described. The records are used for ~he compilation of Key Word Phrase subJec= indexes (K~PSI). The me~hod has been successfully tested for the fully automatic production of KWPSI-type indexes to titles of scientific publications. The usage of KWPSI-type display forma~s for the~enhanced online access to databases is also discussed.","i. The problem o~f automatic compilation of subject indexes","Printed subject indexes (SI), such as back-of-the-book indexes and indexes to periodicals and abstracts journals remain important as the most common tools for information retrieval. Traditionally SI are compiled from subject descriptions produced for this purpose by human indexers. Such subject descriptions are usually nominalized sentences in which the word order is chosen to emphasize as theme one of the objects participating in the description; the corresponding word or word phrase is placed at the beginning of the nominative construction. Furthermore, the nominalized sentence is rendered in a specially transformed ('articulated') way involving the separated by commas display of component word phrases together with the dominating prepositions; e.g. the sentence 'In lemon juice lead (is) determined by atomic absorption spectrometry' becomes 'LEMON JUICE, lead determination in, by atomic absorption spectroscopy.' Such rendering enhances the speedy understanding of the descriptions when browsing the index. At the same time it creates for the subject ~escription a llneary ordered sequence of focuses which can be used for the hierarchical multilevel grouping of related sets of descriptions. The main focus (theme) serves for the grouping of descriptions under a corresponding subject heading, the secondary focuses make possible the further subdivision of such group by subheadings.

A text processing problem, studied in connection with the compilation of such si of traditional type, was the automatic transformation of subject descriptions for selecting their different possible themes and focuses (Armitage, 1967). An experimental procedure, not yet implemented, takes as input pre-edited subject descriptions (Cohen, 1976).","Since the generauion of subjec= descrip=ions by human indexers is a very expensive procedure P. Luhn (1959) of IBM has suggested replacing subject descriptions by titles provided by the publication's authors. Using only a 'negative' dictionary of high frequency words excluded from indexing, he designed a procedure for the automatic compilation of listings where fragments of titles are displayed repeateuly 136 for all their lndexable words, These words are alphabetized and displayed on the printed page in the central position of a column; their contextual fragments are sorted according to the right-hand side COntextS of the index words. Such listings, called Key-Word-ln-Context (ENIC) indexes, have been produced and successfully marketed since 1960 \"quick-a~d-dirty\" $I, despite their 'mechanical' appearance which makes them difficult enough to read and browse.

Such Key-Word-out-of-Context (~WOC) indexes display the full texts of titles under a common beading. Figure 3 shows a KWOC sample generated from title-Like subject descriptions ac the Institute for Scientific Information, The appearance of KWOC indexes is more steep,abe but their bro~elng is much hindered by the lack of articulation of the Lengthy subject descriptions (titles). Without proper articulation, the recognition of the context immediately relevant to the index word becomes too slow.","In 1966 the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) introduced a different type of automatically compiled subject index called PERMUTERM Subject Index (PSI) OGarfieid, 19760, which at present is the main type of SI to the Science Cltation Index and other similar ISI publications. Two different negative dictionaries are used for producing ~his SI: a so called \"full stop list\" of words excluded from becoming headings as well as from being used as subordinate index entries, and a \"semi- stop List\" of ~ords of little informative value, which are noC allowed as headings but are used as index entries along with words ~ound neither in the full-stop uor in ~he semi-stop Lists. ~n the PSI every word Co-occuring wi~h the heading word in some HYORO~E"]},{"title":"Figure 3.

This ability is similar to the ability of computerized online search systems to retrieve titles by any boolean combination of search terms. The corresponding PSI ability is available to PSI users who have been instructed about the principles used for compiling it. The naive user is more likely to utilize it as a browsing tool. When doing so, he may be inclined to perceive the subordinate word entries as being the immediate context of the headings. Used as a browsing tool, PSI may deliver relatively high percentage of false drops because of the lack of contextual information. Another shortcoming of the PSI is its relatively high cost due to its significant size which is proportional to the square of the average length of titles. The large number of entries subordinated to headings which are words of relatively"]},{"title":"high","paragraphs":["frequency makes the exhaustive scanning of entries under such headings a time consumLing procedure.","An important advantage of all the above computer generated indexes over their manually compiled counterparts is the speed and essentially lower cost at which they are made available.","All the above compilation procedures are based exclusively on the most trivial facts concerning the syntaxis and semantics of natural languages. They make use of the fact that texts are built of words, of the existence of words having purely syntactic functions and of the existence of lexlcal units of very little informative value. A common disadvantage versus the SI of traditional type is that the above procedures fall to provide articulated contexts which would be short enough and structurally simple enough to be easily 8rasped in the course of browsing.","Certainly this problem can be solved by any systen which can perform the full syntactic analysis of titles or similar kinds of subject descriptions. From the syntactic tree of the title a brief articulated context can be produced for any given word of a title by detecting a subtree of suitable size which includes the given word. However, in the majority of cases the practical conditions of application of index compilation procedures are excluding the usage of full scale syntactic analysis, based on dictionaries containing the required morphological, syntactic and semantic information for all the lexical units of the processed input. For instance, ISI is processing annually for its mutlidisciplinary publications around 700,000 titles ranging in their subject orientation from science and technology to arts and humanities. The effort needed for the creation and maintenance of dictionaries covering several hundred thousands entries with a high ratio of appearance of new words would be excessive. Therefore, the automatic compilation of SI is practially feasible only on the basis of quite simplistic procedures based on \"negative\" dictionaries involving approximative methods of analysis which yield good results in ~he majority of cases, but are robust enough not to break down even in difficult cases.","At one end of the range of problems involving natural language processsing are such as question answering which require a high degree of analytic sophistication and are based on a significant amount of domain dependent information formated in bulky lexicons. Such procedures appear to be applicable to texts dealing with rather narrow fields of knowledge in the same way as the high levels of iu-depth human expertise are usually limited to specific domains. On the other end of the spectrum are simple problems requiring much less domain dependent information and relatively low levels of \"intelligence\" (oefined as the ability to discuss comprehensive texts from gibberish); the corresponding procedures are usually applicable to wide categories of texts. For reasons explained above, we consider the problems of automatic compilation of subject indexes as belongin~ to this low end of the spectrum.","2. The automatic compilation of Key-Word-Phrase Sub~ect Indexes","In this framework we developed an automatic procedure for the compilaclon of a SI based on :he detection and usage of word phrases. The earlier stages of development of this Key-Word-Phrase subject index (KW?SI) have been reported elsewhere (Vladutz 19795. The procedure starts by detecting certain types of syntactically self-contained segments of the input text; such segments are expected to be semantically self-contained in view of the assumed well-formedness of the input. The segment detection procedure is based on a relatively short list of acceptable syntactic patterns, formulated in terms of markers attributable by a simple dictionary look-up. The markers are essentially ~he same as used in (Klein 1963) in the early days of machine translation for automatic grammatical coding of English words. All the words not found in an exlusion dictionary of \"~ 1,500 words are assigned the two markers ADJ and NOUN. All the acceptable syntactic patterns are characterized in the frameworks of a generative gr=--,~r constructed for title-type texts. Sucn texts are described as sequences of segments of acceptable syntactic patterns separated by arbitrary filler segments whose syntactic pattern is different from the acceptable ones. The analysis procedure leading to the detection of acceptable segments was formulated as a reversal of the generative grammar and is performed by a right =o left scanning. .~ew acceptable syntactic patterns can easily be incorporated into the generative grammar. It is envisaged to use in the future existing programs for automatically generating analysis programs from any specific variant of the grammar.","The present list of acceptable syntactic patterns includes such patterns where noun phrases are concatenated by the preposition 'OF' anu the conjunctions 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR', as well as constructions of the type 'NPI, NP2, ... AND NPi'. Since no prepositions other than 'OF' and no conjunctions other than 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR' can occur in the acceptable segments the occurrences of other prepositions and conjunctions are used for initial delimitation of acceptable segments, but the detection procedure is not limited to such usage. In particular, a past participle or a group containing adve-bs followed by a past participle are excluded from the acceptable segment when preceuing 138 an initial delimiter. The segmentation detection is illustrated for three titles in figure 5.","A) SPREADING OF VIRUS INFECTION among WILD BIRDS And MONKEYS during INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC C a u s • d by VICTORIA(3~75"]},{"title":"V~L~Wr OF,,,A(-~N2} virus","paragraphs":["B) EXERCISE I u d u c • d CHANGES in LEFT-VENTR/CULAR Function in Patients ~rlth MITRALE-VALVE PROLAPSE","C) DIFFERENTIATION OF MLC-INDUCED KILLER And Suppresser TTCELS by SENSITIVITY to FTRILAMINE Figure 5. The detection of acceptable segments is shown for 3 titles. The words with all lowercase letters are prepositions and conjunctions used as initial deli~Liters. The words with only initial capital letters are \"seml-stop\" words, excluded from being used as index headings; the underscored by dotted lines \"seml-stops\" are past participles which become dellminters only when followed by initial dellmi~ars. The resulting multl-word phrases are underscored ~wice unlike the resultlng single word phrases which are underscored once.","The first part of the system's dictionary con-Junctions, prepositions, articles, auxiliary verbs and pronouns. Th/s part is completely domain independent. A second part of the dictionary consists of nouns, adjectives, verbs, present and past participles, all of them of little informative value and, therefore, called \"seml-stop\" words. Such words will not be allowtd later to become SI headings. The semi-stop par~ of the dictionary is somewhat domain-dependent and has to be atuned for different broad fields of knowledge such as science and technology, social sciences or arts and humanities.","The second logical step in the SI compilation involves the transformation of acceptable segments into index records consisting of an informative word (not found in the system's dictionary) displayed as heading llne and of an index llne providing some relevant context for the headlng word. Each multi-word segment generates as many index records as many informative words it contains. The ri~ht-hand side of the segment following the heading word is placed at the beginning of the index line to serve as its i~nediate context and is followed through a senLicolon by the segment's left-hand side. When both sides are non-empty, an articulation of the index line is so achieved. In the case of a single word segment an \"expansion\" procedure is performed during index record generation. It starts by placing at the beginning of the index llne a fragment of the title consisting of the filler portion following the heading word and of the next acceptable segment, if any; this initial portion of the index line is followed by a semicolon after which follows the preceding acceptable segment, followed finally by the filler portion separating in the title this preceding segment from the heading word. The index record generation is illustrated in figure 6. 139","final \"enrichment\" phase of the index record generatlon involves the additional display (in parenthesis) of the unused segments of the processed title.","*SPREADING of VIRUS INFECTION","*VIRUS INFECTION; SPREADING of *","INFECTION SPREADING OF VIRUS *","*WILD BIRDS and MONKEYS","*BIRDS and MONKEYS; WILD *","*MONKEYS WILD BIRDS and *","*INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC","*EPIDEMIC INFLUENZA *","*SENSITIVITY to FYR/LAMINE; DIFFERENTIATION of MLC-INDUCED KILLER SUPRESSOR T-CELLS by *","*PYRILAMINE SENSITIVITY ~o *","Figure 6.

As a result of this stage the informacioual value of the finally generated index record is almost equivalent to the information content of ~ne initial full title.

It includes two modules: the index generation module and the sorting and reformatting module. On an IBM 370 system index records are generated for titles of scholarly papers at a speed of ~ 70,000 titles/hour. The resulting total size of the index is of the same order as the size of KWOC indexes and compares favorably with the size of the PSI index.","The analysis of ~he rates and ~aCure of failures of ~he segment detection algorithm shows that in 96% of cases the generated segments are fully acceptable as valuable index entries. In 2% of cases some important information is lost as a result of the elimination of prepositions, as in case of expressions of 'wood to wood' type. The rest of failures results in somehow awkward segments which are not completely semantically self-contained. Even in such cases the index entries retain some informative value. Around half of the failures can be eliminated by additions to the system's dictionary, especially by the inclusion of more verbs and past participles. Not counted aS failures are the 5% of cases when the leng=h of the detected segments is excessive; such segments can include the whole title.","The extent of tuning required for =he application of the system in a new area of knowledge depends mainly upon ~he extent of figure 8."]},{"title":"*INDEXING","paragraphs":["• KSNIE~CML)","......................","IC-80-2.SS7","CONV[~NC~ md COMP&IIgRJI~ ~T1k~ ~ M.L-UmO~-IIOOR-CHAMIUER u~ MEI~.AL SUlIJ[CT * .........................

This SI would be then printed together with the full list of relevant items. It is ~hought that such kind of interaction could be more user friendly than the currently used boolean mode.","Another way of using the KWPSI technique in an online environment would be to use the KWPSI format for the output of the results of a retrieval performed in a traditional boolean way. The query word which achieved the most strong trimming effect would be used as heading.","A third way would involve the compression of a KWFSI section under a given heading before it is displayed in response to a word. One could e.g. retain only such noun phrases containing the given word which occur at least k times in the database. An example of such list for the \"Arts and Humanities\" database is given in figure 12. By displaying such lists of words closely co- occurring with a given one ~he system would perform thesaurus-type functions.","The implementation of all such possibilities would be rather difficult for any existin 8 system in view of the effort required to reprocess past input. Instead, after the input of a query word the corresponding full text records could be called a not processed online in core for generating KWPSl-type index records.

All the text records containin8 a given (not too frequent) word coulu be initially tapped from the database into the microcomputer.
