It is the first time that this conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics has been held outside of the United States: it follows on from ones held in Santa Monica, California in 1983 and in Austin, Texas in 1988.","Thirty papers and eighteen posters were selected from one hundred submissions to the program committee from four continents. A rich demonstration program of about thirty system demonstrations together with a video program, show Concretely the level of achievement of applied natural language processing research.","The success is due to to a number of people. In the first place to Don Walker (ACL Secretary-Treasurer, Bellcore) who encouraged us and gave his precious advice on all the phases of the conference organization. The main credit for the success of the conference of course goes to the paper, poster video and demo authors. The majority of submitted papers reported were of high quality work and to select only fewer than one third of them for inclusion as full papers in the program has been a very difficult task for the program committee. Some other submissions were thought as more appropriate for a poster presentation. The main criteria for posters was that the material seemed to be best presented in that format. A two page abstract of each poster is also included in this volume. We are indebted to the Program Committee members, who have worked with a lot of dedication and seriousness and have shown the capability for making difficult decisions: Robert Amsler,"]},{"title":"MITRE","paragraphs":["Giacomo Ferrari,"]},{"title":"Univ. of Pisa","paragraphs":["Eduard Hovy,"]},{"title":"USC/IS1","paragraphs":["Paul Jacobs,"]},{"title":"General Electric","paragraphs":["Martin Kay,"]},{"title":"Xerox PARC","paragraphs":["Mark Liberman,"]},{"title":"Univ.

To him our thanks as to all of the IRST staff involved. We are particularly indebted to Jon Slack, who organized the tutorials; to Carlo Strapparava, who 111 has taken care of the demonstrations, and to the preconference workshop organizers.

Problems encountered by current commercially available MT systems will also be discussed. In particular, the adaptability of MT systems will be considered. New paradigms for MT, such as Statistic-based MT, Example-based MT, and Analogy-based MT will also be considered from the point of view of \"adaptability\".

There is also the possibility of interacting with demonstrations relating to applications in dictation and person/robot dialogue. Evaluation of Natural Language ModAlities Sharon Oviatt and Philip Cohen,"]},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Center, SRI International","paragraphs":["The tutorial will present both empirical and computational issues relevant to the evaluation of different interactive natural language modalities. Basic evaluation goals and tools will be outlined for conducting both linguistic and performance assessments. Topics will include evaluation of relatively standard modalities, such as keyboard, speech, and handwriting (i.e., pen systems). In addition, the tutorial will present approaches to the assessment of more complex communication modalities that involve multimodal, multiparty, or multilingual interactions (e.g., interpreted spoken dialogues). The relevant literature and exemplary natural language systems will be discussed and critiqued. Whenever possible, both human-human and human-computer exchanges within different communication modalities will be compared. Participants will receive hands-on experience with the difficulties inherent in analyzing the relevant linguistic and behavioral data. Finally, the tutorial will identify future directions in language-oriented systems, as well as the dynamic evaluation techniques and strategies that will be needed to support their development.","XUXEN: A Spelling Checker / Corrector for Basque Based on Two-Level Morphology Agirre E., Alegria I., Arregi X., Artola X., Diaz de Ilarraza A., Maritxalar M., Sarasola K., Urkia M
