(Our experience is that rather than requiring 50 or so iterations, three suffice.)

As the generative model is top-down and we use a standard bottom-up best-first probabilistic chart parser [2,7], we use the chart parser as a first pass to generate candidate possible parses to be evaluated in the second pass by our probabilistic model. For runs with the generative model based upon Markov grammar statistics, the first pass uses the same statistics, but conditioned only on standard PCFG information. This allows the second pass to see expansions not present in the training corpus.","We use the gathered statistics for all observed words, even those with very low counts, though obviously our deleted interpolation smoothing gives less emphasis to observed probabilities for rare words. We guess the preterminals of words that are not observed in the training data using statistics on capitalization, hyphenation, word endings (the last two letters), and the probability that a given pre-terminal is realized using a previously unobserved word.","As noted above, the probability model uses 135 Parser LR LP CB 0CB 2CB","< 40 words (2245 sentences) Char97 87.5 87.4 1.00 62.1 86.1 Co1199 88.5 88.7 0.92 66.7 87.1 Char00 90.1 90.1 0.74 70.1 89.6","< 100 words (2416 sentences) Char97 86.7 86.6 1.20 59.9 83.2 Coll99 88.1 88.3 1.06 64.0 85.1 Ratna99 86.3 87.5 Char00 89.6 89.5 0.88 67.6 87.7 Figure 1: Parsing results compared with previous work five smoothed probability distributions, one each for L~, M,"]},{"title":"Ri, t,","paragraphs":["and h.

Also, the label of the parent constituent Ip is conditioned upon even when it is not obviously related to the further conditioning events. This is due to the importance of this factor in parsing, as noted in,"]},{"title":"e.g., [14].","paragraphs":["In keeping with the standard methodology [5, 9,10,15,17], we used the Penn Wall Street Journal tree-bank [16] with sections 2-21 for training, section 23 for testing, and section 24 for development (debugging and tuning).","Performance on the test corpus is measured using the standard measures from [5,9,10,17]. In particular, we measure labeled precision (LP) and recall (LR), average number of cross-brackets per sentence (CB), percentage of sentences with zero cross brackets (0CB), and percentage of sentences with < 2 cross brackets (2CB). Again as standard, we take separate measurements for all sentences of length <_ 40 and all sentences of length < 100. Note that the definitions of labeled precision and recall are those given in [9] and used in all of the previous work. As noted in [5], these definitions typically give results about 0.4% higher than the more obvious ones. The results for the new parser as well as for the previous top-three individual parsers on this corpus are given in Figure 1. As is typical, all of the standard measures tell pretty much the same story, with the new parser outperforming the other three parsers. Looking in particular at the precision and recall figures, the new parser's give us a 13% error reduction over the best of the previous work, Co1199 [9]. 5 Discussion In the previous sections we have concentrated on the relation of the parser to a maximum-entropy approach, the aspect of the parser that is most novel. However, we do not think this aspect is the sole or even the most important reason for its comparative success. Here we list what we believe to be the most significant contributions and give some experimental results on how well the program behaves without them.","We take as our starting point the parser labled Char97 in Figure 1 [5], as that is the program from which our current parser derives. That parser, as stated in Figure 1, achieves an average precision/recall of 87.5. As noted in [5], that system is based upon a \"tree-bank grammar\" -- a grammar read directly off the training corpus. This is as opposed to the \"Markov-grammar\" approach used in the current parser. Also, the earlier parser uses two techniques not employed in the current parser. First, it uses a clustering scheme on words to give the system a \"soft\" clustering of heads and sub-heads. (It is \"soft\" clustering in that a word can be-long to more than one cluster with different weights -- the weights express the probability of producing the word given that one is going to produce a word from that cluster.) Second, Char97 uses unsupervised learning in that the original system was run on about thirty million words of unparsed text, the output was taken as \"correct\", and statistics were collected on the resulting parses. Without these enhancements Char97 performs at the 86.6% level for sentences of length < 40.","In this section we evaluate the effects of the various changes we have made by running various versions of our current program. To avoid repeated evaluations based upon the testing corpus, here our evaluation is based upon sentences of length < 40 from the development corpus. We note here that this corpus is somewhat more difficult than the \"official\" test corpus. For example, the final version of our system","136 System Precision Recall Old 86.3 86.1 Explicit Pre-Term 88.0 88.1 Marked Coordination 88.6 88.7 Standard Interpolation 88.2 88.3 MaxEnt-Inspired 89.0 89.2 First-order Markov 88.6 87.4 Second-order Markov 89.5 89.3 Best 89.8 89.6 Figure 2: Labeled precision/recall for length < 40, development corpus achieves an average precision/recall of 90.1% on the test corpus but an average precision/recall of only 89.7% on the development corpus. This is indicated in Figure 2, where the model labeled \"Best\" has precision of 89.8% and recall of 89.6% for an average of 89.7%, 0.4% lower than the results on the official test corpus. This is in accord with our experience that development-corpus results are from 0.3% to 0.5% lower than those obtained on the test corpus.","The model labeled \"Old\" attempts to recreate the Char97 system using the current program. It makes no use of special maximum-entropy-inspired features (though their presence made it much easier to perform these experiments), it does not guess the pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head, and it uses a tree-bank grammar rather than a Markov grammar. This parser achieves an average precision/recall of 86.2%. This is consistent with the average precision/recall of 86.6% for [5] mentioned above, as the latter was on the test corpus and the for-mer on the development corpus.","Between the Old model and the Best model, Figure 2 gives precision/recall measurements for several different versions of our parser. One of the first and without doubt the most significant change we made in the current parser is to move from two stages of probabilistic decisions at each node to three. As already noted, Char97 first guesses the lexical head of a constituent and then, given the head, guesses the"]},{"title":"PCFG","paragraphs":["rule used to expand the constituent in question. In contrast, the current parser first guesses the head's pre~terminal, then the head, and then the expansion. It turns out that usefulness of this process had a/ready been discovered by Collins [10], who in turn notes (personal communica-tion) that it was previously used by Eisner [12]. However, Collins in [10] does not stress the decision to guess the head's pre-terminal first, and it might be lost on the casual reader. Indeed, it was lost on the present author until he went back after the fact and found it there. In Figure 2 we show that this one factor improves performance by nearly 2%.","It may not be obvious why this should make so great a difference, since most words are effectively unambiguous. (For example, part-of-speech tagging using the most probable pre-terminal for each word is 90% accurate [8].) We believe that two factors contribute to this performance gain. The first is simply that if we first guess the pre~terminal, when we go to guess the head the first thing we can condition upon is the pre-terminal, i.e., we compute"]},{"title":"p(h I","paragraphs":["t).

For example, the tree-bank PCFG probability of the rule \"vp --+ vbg np\" is 0.0145, whereas once we condition on the fact that the lexical head is a vbg we get a probability of 0.214.","The second modification is the explicit mark-ing of noun and verb-phrase coordination. We have already noted the importance of conditioning on the parent label l v. So, for example, information about an np is conditioned on the parent -- e.g., an s, vp, pp, etc. Note that when an np is part of an np coordinate structure the 137 vp aux vp vbd np Figure 3: Verb phrase with both main and auxiliary verbs parent will itself be an np, and similarly for a vp. But nps and vps can occur with np and vp parents in non-coordinate structures as well. For example, in the Penn Treebank a vp with both main and auxiliary verbs has the structure shown in Figure 3. Note that the subordinate vp has a vp parent.","Thus np and vp parents of constituents are marked to indicate if the parents are a coordinate structure. A vp coordinate structure is defined here as a constituent with two or more vp children, one or more of the constituents comma, cc, conjp (conjunctive phrase), and nothing else; coordinate np phrases are defined similarly. Something very much like this is done in [15]. As shown in Figure 2, conditioning on this information gives a 0.6% improvement. We believe that this is mostly due to improvements in guessing the sub-constituent's pre-terminai and head. Given we are already at the 88% level of accuracy, we judge a 0.6% improvement to be very much worth while.","Next we add the less obvious conditioning events noted in our previous discussion of the final model -- grandparent label I a and left sibling label"]},{"title":"lb.","paragraphs":["When we do so using our maximum-entropy-inspired conditioning, we get another 0.45% improvement in average precision/recall, as indicated in Figure 2 on the line labeled \"MaocEnt-Inspired'. Note that we also tried including this information using a standard deleted-interpolation model. The results here are shown in the line \"Standard Interpolation\". Including this information within a standard deleted-interpolation model causes a 0.6% decrease from the results using the less conventional model. Indeed, the resulting performance is worse than not using this information at all.","Up to this point all the models considered in this section are tree-bank grammar models. That is, the PCFG grammar rules are read directly off the training corpus. As already noted, our best model uses a Markov-grammar approach. As one can see in Figure 2, a first-order Markov grammar (with all the aforemen-tioned improvements) performs slightly worse than the equivalent tree-bank-grammar parser. However, a second-order grammar does slightly better and a third-order grammar does significantly better than the tree-bank parser. 6 Conclusion We have presented a lexicalized Markov grammar parsing model that achieves (using the now standard training/testing/development sections of the Penn treebank) an average precision/recall of 91.1% on sentences of length < 40 and 89.5% on sentences of length < 100. This corresponds to an error reduction of 13% over the best previously published single parser results on this test set, those of Collins [9]. That the previous three best parsers on this test [5,9,17] all perform within a percentage point of each other, despite quite different basic mechanisms, led some researchers to wonder if there might be some maximum level of parsing performance that could be obtained using the treebank for training, and to conjecture that perhaps we were at it. The results reported here disprove this conjecture. The results of [13] achieved by combining the aforementioned three-best parsers also suggest that the limit on tree-bank trained parsers is much higher than previously thought. Indeed, it may be that adding this new parser to the mix may yield still higher results.","From our perspective, perhaps the two most important numbers to come out of this research are the overall error reduction of 13% over the results in [9] and the intermediateresult improvement of nearly 2% on labeled precision/recall due to the simple idea of guessing the bead's pre-terminal before guessing the head. Neither of these results were anticipated at the start of this research.","As noted above, the main methodological innovation presented here is our \"maximum-entropy-inspired\" model for conditioning and smoothing. Two aspects of this model deserve some comment. The first is the slight, but important, improvement achieved by using this model over conventional deleted interpolation, as indicated in Figure 2. We expect that as 138 we experiment with other, more semantic conditioning information, the importance of this aspect of the model will increase.","More important in our eyes, though, is the flexibility of the maximum-entropy-inspired model. Though in some respects not quite as flexible as true maximum entropy, it is much simpler and, in our estimation, has benefits when it comes to smoothing. Ultimately it is this flexibility that let us try the various conditioning events, to move on to a Markov grammar approach, and to try several Markov grammars of different orders, without significant programming. Indeed, we initiated this line of work in an attempt to create a parser that would be flexible enough to allow modifications for parsing down to more semantic levels of detail. It is to this project that our future parsing work will be devoted."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1. BERGER, A. L., PIETRA, S. A. D. AND PIETRA, V. J. D.
