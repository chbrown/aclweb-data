Although these systems inter-act with users in a manner more similar to human-human interactions than earlier systems employing system initiative strategies, their response strategies are typically selected using only local dialogue context, disregarding dialogue history. Therefore, their gain in naturalness and performance under optimal conditions is often overshadowed by their inability to cope with anomalies in dialogues by automatically adapting dialogue strategies. In contrast, Figure 1 shows a dialogue in which the system automatically adapts dialogue strategies based on the current user utterance and dialogue history. 1 After failing to obtain a valid response to an information-seeking query in utterance (4), the system adapted dialogue strategies to provide additional information in (6) that assisted the user in responding to the query. Further-more, after the user responded to a limited system prompt in (10) with a fully-specified query in (11), implicitly indicating her intention to take charge of the problem-","IS and U indicate system and user utterances, respectively.

However, no earlier system allowed for initiative-oriented automatic strategy adaptation based on information dynamically extracted from the user's spoken input. In this paper, we briefly introduce MIMIC, a mixed initiative spoken dialogue system that automatically adapts dialogue strategies. We then describe two experiments that evaluated the effectiveness of MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation capabilities. Our results show that, when analyzed along the performance dimension, MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation features lead to more efficient dialogues and higher user satisfaction. Moreover, when analyzed along the discourse and initiative dimensions, MIMIC's adaptation capabilities result in dialogues in which system behavior better matches user expectations and dialogue anomalies are resolved more efficiently. 2 MIMIC: An"]},{"title":"Adaptive Mixed Initiative Dialogue System","paragraphs":["MIMIC is a voice-enabled, telephone-based dialogue system that provides movie showtime information.

Task Dialogue Initiative Initiative User System System System System System Figure 1: An Adaptive Mixed Initiative Dialogue with MIMIC lead in the process toward achieving the dialogue participants' domain goal, while dialogue initiative models the lead in determining the current discourse focus. In our information query application domain, MIMIC has task (and thus dialogue) initiative when its utterances are intended to provide helpful guidance toward achieving the user's domain goal, while it has dialogue but not task initiative if its utterances only specify the current discourse goal. 2 For example, as a result of MIMIC taking over task initiative in (6), helpful guidance, in the form of valid response choices, was provided in its attempt to obtain a theater name after the user failed to answer an earlier question intended to solicit this information. In (4), MIMIC specified the current discourse goal (requesting information about a missing theater) but did not suggest valid response choices since it only had dialogue initiative.","MIMIC's ability to automatically adapt dialogue strategies is achieved by employing an initiative module that determines initiative distribution based on participant roles, cues detected during the current user utterance, and dialogue history (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998). This initiative framework utilizes the Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer, 1976; Gordon and Shortliffe, 1984), and represents the current initiative distribution as two basic probability assignments (bpas) that signify the overall amount of evidence supporting each agent having task and dialogue initiatives. The effects that a cue has on changing the current task and dialogue initiative distribution are also represented as bpas, obtained using an iterative training procedure on a corpus of transcribed","21n the dialogues collected in our experiments, which are described in Section 3, there are system turns in which MIMIC had neither task nor dialogue initiative. However, such cases are rare in this domain and will not be discussed in this paper. and annotated human-human dialogues. At the end of each user turn, the bpas representing the effects of cues detected during that turn are combined with the bpas representing the current initiative distribution to obtain the initiative distribution for the system's next turn.","In Figure 1, utterance (3) triggered the cue AmbiguousAction since the town of Montclair has multiple the-aters. Although AmbiguousAction contributed to the system having both initiatives in the next turn, the effect of this cue, when combined with the initiative distribution of (3), resulted in MIMIC having dialogue but not task initiative in (4). However, in addition to triggering AmbiguousAction, utterance (5) also triggered NoNewlnfo, since it did not contribute any new information. The effect of these two cues, combined with the initiative distribution in (5), was enough to lead MIMIC to take over task initiative in (6). 2.2 Modification of Adaptation Behavior MIMIC employs an initiative module which is decoupied from its goal selection process, while allowing the outcome of both processes to guide its response strategy selection. A major advantage of this design is that changes in the system's strategy selection behavior, and thus its adaptation behavior, can be achieved by modifying parameters in the initiative module, while leaving the goal and strategy selection processes intact. The initiative module determines initiative distribution based on participant roles, cues observed in the current user utterance, and dialogue history. Although all three factors may play a role in modifying MIMIC's adaptation behavior, we discuss how the effects of participant roles and dialogue history are modified to create systems used as bases of comparison in our experiments.","Participant roles affect the default initiative distribu-203"]},{"title":"Utterance","paragraphs":["(14) S: Hello, this is MIMIC, the movie information system.

Users were able to complete tasks in fewer turns and in a more timely manner using MIMIC.","When comparing MIMIC and MIMIC-MI, dialogues involving MIMIC had a lower timeout rate. When MIMIC detected cues signaling anomalies in the dialogue, it adapted strategies to provide assistance, which in addition to leading to fewer timeouts, saved users time and effort when they did not know what to say. In contrast, users interacting with MIMIC-MI had to iteratively reformulate questions until they obtained the desired information from the system, leading to more timeouts (see (41)-(49) in Figure 3). However, when comparing MIMIC and MIMIC-SI, even though users accomplished tasks more efficiently with MIMIC, the resulting dialogues contained more timeouts. As opposed to MIMIC-SI, which always prompted users for one piece of information at a time, MIMIC typically provided more open-ended prompts when the user had task initiative. Even though this required more effort on the user's part in for-mulating utterances and led to more timeouts, MIMIC quickly adapted strategies to assist users when recognized cues indicated that they were having trouble.","To sum up, our experiments show that both MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects resulted in better performance along the dialogue efficiency and system usability dimensions. Moreover, its adaptation capabilities contributed to better performance in terms of dialogue quality. MIMIC, however, did not contribute to higher performance in the task success dimension. In our movie information domain, the tasks were sufficiently simple; thus, all but one user in each experiment achieved a 100% task success rate. 4.2 Discourse Features Our second evaluation dimension concerns characteristics of resulting dialogues. We analyzed features of user utterances in terms of utterance length and cues observed and features of system utterances in terms of dialogue acts. For each feature, we again applied a three-way ANOVA test, and if no interaction effects emerged, we performed a paired sample t-test to compare system versions.","The cues detected in user utterances provide insight into both user intentions and system capabilities.

Even though MIMIC-SI did not behave as expected, the users continued their attempts, resulting in significantly more occurrences of TakeOverTask in dialogues with MIMIC-SI than with MIMIC. Furthermore, the average sentence length in dialogues with MIMIC was only 1.5 words per turn longer than in dialogues with MIMIC-SI, providing further evidence that users","~2Since system dialogue acts are often selected based on cues detected in user utterances, we only discuss results of our user utterance feature analysis, using dialogue act analysis results as additional support for our conclusions. 207 preferred to provide free-formed queries, regardless of system version used.","Table 2(b) shows that MIMIC was more effective at resolving dialogue anomalies than MIMIC-MI. More specifically, there were significantly fewer occurrences of NoNewlnfo in dialogues with MIMIC than with MIMIC-MI. In addition, while the number of occurrences of AmbiguousAction was not significantly different for the two systems, the number that were resolved (AmbiguousActionResolved) was significantly higher in interactions with MIMIC than with MIMIC-MI. Since NoNewlnfo and AmbiguousAction both prompted MIMIC to adapt strategies and, as a resuit, provide additional useful information, the user was able to quickly resolve the problem at hand. This is further supported by the higher frequency of the system dialogue act GiveOptions in MIMIC (p=0), which provides helpful information based on dialogue context.","In sum, the results of our discourse feature analysis further confirm the usefulness of MIMIC's adaptation capabilities. Comparisons with MIMIC-SI provide evidence that MIMIC's ability to give up initiative better matched user expectations. Moreover, comparisons with MIMIC-MI show that MIMIC's ability to opportunistically take over initiative resulted in dialogues in which anomalies were more efficiently resolved and progress toward task completion was more consistently made. 4.3 Initiative Analysis Our final analysis concerns the task initiative distribution in our adaptive system in relation to the features previously discussed. For each dialogue involving MIMIC, we computed the percentage of turns in which MIMIC had task initiative and the correlation coefficient (r) between the initiative percentage and each performance/discourse feature. To determine if this correlation was significant, we performed Fisher' s r to z transform, upon which a conventional Z test was performed (Cohen, 1995).","Tables 3(a) and (b) summarize the correlation between the performance and discourse features and the percentage of turns in which MIMIC has task initiative, respectively. 13 Again, those correlations which are statistically significant are shown in italics. Table 3(a) shows a strong positive correlation between task initiative distribution and the number of user turns as well as the elapsed time of the dialogues. Although earlier results (Table l(a)) show that dialogues in which the system always had task initiative tended to be longer, we believe that this correlation also suggests that MIMIC took over task initiative more often in longer dialogues, those in which the user was more likely to be having difficulty. Table 3(a) further shows moderate correlation between task initiative distribution and ASR rejection rate as well as ASR word error rate. It is possible that such a correlation exists","13This test was not performed for user satisfaction, since user sarisfaction was a per subject and not a per dialogue feature.

However, in that case, we would have expected the results in Section 4.1 to show that the ASR rejection and word error rates for MIMIC-SI are significantly greater than those for MIMIC, which are in turn significantly greater than those for MIMIC-MI, since in MIMIC-SI the system always had task initiative and in MIMIC-MI the system never took over task initiative. To the contrary, Tables l(a) and l(b) showed that the differences in ASR rejection rate and ASR word error rate were not significant between system versions, and Table l(b) showed that ASR word error rate for MIMIC-MI was in fact quite substantially higher than that for MIMIC. This suggests that the causal relationship is the other way around, i.e., MIMIC's adaptation capabilities allowed it to opportunistically take over task initiative when ASR performance was poor.","Table 3(b) shows that all cues are positively correlated with task initiative distribution. For AmbiguousAction, lnvalidAction, and NoNewlnfo, this correlation exists because observation of these cues contributed to MIMIC having task initiative. However, note that AmbiguousActionResolved has a stronger positive correlation with task initiative distribution than does AmbiguousAction, again indicating that MIMIC's adaptive strategies contributed to more efficient resolution of ambiguous actions.","In brief, our initiative analysis lends additional support to the conclusions drawn in our performance and discourse feature analyses and provides new evidence for the advantages of MIMIC's adaptation capabilities. 208 In addition to taking over task initiative when previously identified dialogue anomalies were encountered (e.g., detection of ambiguous or invalid actions), our analysis shows that MIMIC took over task initiative when ASR performance was poor, allowing the system to better constrain user utterances, t4"]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["This paper described an empirical evaluation of MIMIC, an adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system.
