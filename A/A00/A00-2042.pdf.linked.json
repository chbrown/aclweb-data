In this paper, we show that model generation can be used to model this process in the case of reciprocal statements. The proposed analysis builds on in-sights from Dalrymple et al. 98 and is shown to provide an integrated, computational account of the interplay between model theoretic interpretation, knowledge-based reasoning and preferences that characterises the interpretation of reciprocals. 1 Introduction Although there is widespread agreement that inference is an essential component of natural language processing, little work has been done so far on whether existing automated reasoning systems such as theorem provers and model builders could be fruitfully put to work in the area of natural language interpretation.","In this paper, we focus on the inference problems raised by the reciprocal expression each other and show that model generation provides an adequate tool for modeling them.","The paper is structured as follows. Section 3 discusses the meaning of reciprocal statements and proposes a formal semantics for each other. Section 2 shows how model generation can be used to provide this semantics with a computational interpretation. Section 4 compares our approach with the account of reciprocals which inspired it in the first place namely, (Dalrymple et al., 1998). Section 5 concludes with pointers for further research.","2 The meaning of reciprocal statements In the linguistic literature, the reciprocal expression each other is often taken to denote a dyadic quantifier over a first-order set, which we will call the antecedent set, and a binary first-order relation, which we will call the scope relation. In what follows, we assume an approach of this type and will use the symbol RcP for such reciprocal quantifiers so that the semantic representation of e.g. Jon and Bill saw each other will be:"]},{"title":"(1) RcP({jon, saw(x, y))","paragraphs":["When antecedent sets of just two members are considered, each set member is required to stand in the scope relation to each other member.

But an analogous interpretation would be invalid in the case of (3) and (4) where not all pairs in the antecedent set the students can consistently stand in the scope relation (one can only stare at most at one person at a time, and 319 one can only get measles from at most one person). More generally, (Langendoen, 1978; Dalrymple et al., 1998) convincingly argues that different reciprocal statements can have very different truth conditions. The challenge to be addressed is thus the following: How can we determine a (computational) semantics for the reciprocal expressions each other that accounts for these multiplicity of meanings while predict-ing the specific meaning of a particular reciprocal statement?","Clearly knowledge based reasoning plays an important role: only those readings are possible that are consistent with our knowledge about the situation and the world. Specifically, knowledge based reasoning constrains the strength of the truth conditions of a reciprocal statement. Thus if we abstract away from the specific scope relations, the truth conditions of examples such as (2),(3) and (4) are ordered through entailment as follows (with A the antecedent set and R the scope relation):"]},{"title":"Vx (A(x) --~ Vy (A(y) --).

By contrast in (3), the knowledge that one can stare at most at one person, forces a V3 reading while in (4), a weaker meaning still is imposed by knowledge based constraints: the x gave y measles relation is asymmetric hence the k~/reading is ruled out; moreover, since one cannot be infected twice, some students in the group will be infected but not pass on the disease to anyone. Hence the strongest truth conditions that can be assigned the sentence are the VS disjunctive reading indicated in (4).","But are there any other constraints on the interpretation process than these knowledge based constraints? And which meaning shall we assign a reciprocal expression? The computational semantics we will propose is inspired from (Dalrymple et al., 1998) and relies on the following observations.","First, we note that (Dalrymple et al., 1998) identifies a lower bound for the truth conditions of reciprocal sentences which they dub Inclusive Alternative Ordering (IAO).

For instance in (3), not every student can stare at every other student (one can stare at at most one person), but intuitively, the sentence requires that every student stares at some other student. While such an interpretation is much weaker than that of (2), this maximisation of the scope relation yields a reading that is also much stronger than the minimal IAO interpretation of (4). More generally, while IAO provides us with a lower bound for the interpretation of reciprocal statements, we will see in section 3 that the maximisation of the scope relation that is consistent with contextual knowledge yields the upper bound for the interpretation of a particular reciprocal statement i.e., its meaning.","Based on these observations, the principle determining the actual logical contribution of a reciprocal statement can be stated as follows:"]},{"title":"Maximise Meaning Hypothesis","paragraphs":["(MMH): The valid interpretations of a reciprocal sentence S in a context F (where I\" includes knowledge about the previous discourse, the discourse situation and the world) are those which (a) are consistent both with the IAO form of reciprocity and the information provided by F, and (b) whose contributions to the scope relation are the strongest. The MMH selects from the set of interpretations that are consistent with IAO and contextual knowledge, those that maximise the scope relation. Crucially, this view of reciprocals leads 320 to an inference method that can actually compute the preferred interpretations of reciprocal sentences. We now turn to this.","3 Interpretation as Model Generation In Discourse Representation Theory (DRT, (Kamp, 1981; Kamp and Reyle, 1993)), a sentence with semantic representation (I) is true with respect to a model M iff there is an embedding of (I) onto M.

They show how given a single semantic representation for reciprocals, a variety of meanings can be derived as required by each specific reciprocal statement. Two elements are crucial to the account: the use of model building, and that of minimality as an implementation of preferences. Model building allows us to compute all the finite interpretations of a sentence that are consistent with contextual knowledge and with an IAO interpretation of the reciprocal expression. Preferences on the other hand (i.e. the use of the cost predicate $R and the search for conservative mininal models), permits choosing among these interpretations the most likely one(s) namely, the interpretation(s) maximising the scope relation. 4 Related Work (Dalrymple et al., 1998) (henceforth DKKMP) proposes the following taxonomy of meanings for reciprocal statements (A stands for the antecedent set and R for the scope relation):","Strong Reciprocity (SR) Vx, y E A(x ¢ y ~ xRy).","Intermediate reciprocity (IR) Vx, y E A 3zl,...3Zm E A(x xRzl A . . .

A (zmRy Y yRzm))","Inclusive Alternative Ordering (IAO) Vx E A Sy E A(xRy Y yRx)","To predict the meaning of a specific reciprocal sentence, DKKMP then postulate the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis which says that the meaning of a reciprocal sentence is the logically strongest meaning consistent with world and contextual knowledge.","The main difference between the DKKMP approach and the present approach lies in how the best reading is determined: it is the logically strongest of the five postulated meanings in DKKMP, whereas in our approach, it is that reading which maximises the scope relation of the reciprocal. This difference has both empiri-cal and computational consequences.","Empirically, the predictions are the same in most cases because maximising the scope relation often results in yielding a logically stronger meaning. In particular, as is illustrated by the examples in section 2, the present approach captures the five meanings postulated by DKKMP. Thus model (13) exemplifies an SR reading, model (15) an IR reading and model (14) an OWR reading. Further, model (16) is an IAR interpretation while model (17) shows an IAO reading.","But as the examples also show there are cases where the predictions differ. In particular, in the DKKMP approach, sentence (3) is assigned the IR reading represented by model (15). However as they themselves observe, the sentence also has a natural OWR interpretation namely, one as depicted in model (14), in which some pairs of students reciprocally stare at each other. This is predicted by the present approach which says that models (14) and (15) are equally plausible since they both maximise the stare at relation to cardinality five.","On the other hand, the DKKMP account is more appropriate for examples such as:","(18) The students sat next to each other a. forming a nice cercle. 324 b. filling the bench. c. some to the front and others to the back of the church.","An IR interpretation is predicted for (18) which is compatible with both continuation (18a) and continuation (18b). By contrast, the model generation approach predicts that the preferred interpretation is a model in which the students form a circle, an interpretation compatible with continuation (18a) but not with continuations (18b-c).","However, both approaches fail to predict the reading made explicit by continuation (18c) since this corresponds to the weaker OWR interpretation under the DKKMP account and to a model which fails to maximise the scope relation under the present approach. More generally, both approaches fail to capture the semantic vagueness of reciprocal statements illustrated by the following examples1:","(19) a. The students often help each other with their homework. b. In the closing minutes of the game, the members of the losing team tried to encourage each other.","In both cases, the sentences can be true with-out maximising either the strength of its truth conditions (Strong Reciprocity) or the scope relation. This suggests that an empirically more correct analysis of reciprocals should involve prototypical and probabilistic knowledge - as it is essentially a computational approximation of the DKKMP approach, the present account does not integrate such information though it is compatible with it: just as we restrict the set of generated models to the set of conservative minimal models, we could restrict it to the set of models having some minimal probability.","Computationally, the difference between the DKKMP and the present approach is as follows. In essence, the DKKMP approach requires that each of the five possible readings (together with the relevant world knoweldge) be checked for consistency: some will be consistent, others will not.

In the case of reciprocals, the ranking is given by the size of the scope relation, but other ranking criteria have already been identified in the literature as well. For instance, (Gardent and Konrad, To appear) shows that in the case of definite descriptions, the ranking defined by local minimality permits capturing the preference of binding over bridging, over accomoda-tion. Similarly (Baumgartner and Kiihn, 1999) shows that a predicate minimisation together with a preference for logically consequent reso-325 lutions can be used to model the interpretation of pronominal anaphora.","This suggests that one of the most promising application of model generators is as a device for developing and testing"]},{"title":"preference systems","paragraphs":["for the interpretation of natural language. Inference and knowledge based reasoning are needed in NLP not only to check for consistency and informativity (as illustrated in e.g. (Blackburn et al., 1999)), but also to express preferences between, or constraints on, possible interpretations. For this, finite model builders are natural tools.","Another area that deserves further investigation concerns the use of minimality for disambiguation. In this paper, conservative minimality is used to choose among the possible interpretations of a particular reciprocal statement. On the other hand, (Gardent and Webber, January 2000) shows that minimality is also an important tool for disambiguating nouncompounds, logical metonymy and definite de-scriptions. As the paper shows though, many questions remains open about this use of minimality for disambiguation which are well worth investigating.","In further work, we intend to look at other ambiguous natural language constructs and to identify and model the ranking criteria determining their preferred interpretation. Plurals are a first obvious choice. But more generally, we hope that looking at a wider range of data will unveil a broader picture of what the general biases are which help determine a preferred reading -- either in isolation, as here, or in context, as in (Gardent and Webber, January 2000) -- and of how these biases can be modelled using automated reasoning systems.
