The former has the advantage of years of development of efficient techniques for indexing and searching large collections of data, but lacks of any meaningful treatment of the semantics of the query or the texts indexed. NLP tackles the semantics, but tends to be computationally expensive.","We have attempted to carve out a middle ground, whereby we use a modified IR system augmented by shallow NL parsing. Our approach was motivated by the following problem with traditional IR systems. Suppose the user asks \"Where did <some event> happen?\". If the system does no pre-processing of the query, then \"where\" will be included in the bag of words submitted to the search engine, but this will not be helpful since the target text will be unlikely to contain the word \"where\". If the word is stripped out as a stop-word, then * The work presented in this paper was performed while the first and third authors were at 1BM Research. the search engine will have no idea that a location is sought.

Then traditional bag-of-words matching proceeds successfully, and will return matching passages. The answer-selection process then looks for and ranks in these passages occurrences of phrases containing the particular QA-Token(s) from the augmented query. This classification of questions is conceptually similar to the query expansion in (Voorhees, 1994) but is expected to achieve much better performance since potentially matching phrases in text are classified in a similar and synergistic way.","Our system participated in the official TREC Q&A evaluation. For 200 questions in the evaluation set, we were asked to provide a list of 50-byte and 250-byte extracts from a 2-GB corpus. The results are shown in Section 7.","Some techniques used by other participants in the TREC evaluation are paragraph indexing, followed by abductive inference (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999) and knowledge-representation combined with information retrieval (Breck et al., 1999). Some earlier systems related to our work are FaqFinder (Kulyukin et al., 1998), MURAX (Kupiec, 1993), which uses an encyclopedia as a knowledge base from which to extract answers, and PROFILE (Radev and McKeown, 1997) which identifies named entities and noun phrases that describe them in text."]},{"title":"2 System description","paragraphs":["Our system (Figure 1) consists of two pieces: an IR component (GuruQA) that which returns matching texts, and an answer selection compo-150 neat (AnSel/Werlect) that extracts and ranks potential answers from these texts.","This paper focuses on the process of"]},{"title":"ranking potential answers","paragraphs":["selected by the IR engine, which is itself described in (Prager et al., 1999)."]},{"title":"~ lndexer ~ Searc~x'~ GuruQA \\","paragraphs":["\\"]},{"title":"Rankcd ~ AnSel/ ~ Hit List H tL st [ [ Werlect I Answer selection","paragraphs":["Figure 1: System Architecture. 2.1 The Information Retrieval","component In the context of fact-seeking questions, we made the following observations:","• In documents that contain the answers, the query terms tend to occur in close proximity to each other.","• The answers to fact-seeking questions are usually phrases: \"President Clinton\", \"in the Rocky Mountains\", and \"today\").","• These phrases can be categorized by a set of a dozen or so labels (Figure 2) corresponding to question types.","• The phrases can be identified in text by pattern matching techniques (without full NLP).","As a result, we defined a set of about 20 categories, each labeled with its own QA-Token, and built an IR system which deviates from the traditional model in three important aspects.","• We process the query against a set of approximately 200 question templates which, may replace some of the query words with a set of QA-Tokens, called a SYN-class. Thus \"Where\" gets mapped to \"PLACES\", but \"How long \" goes to \"@SYN(LENGTH$, DURATIONS)\". Some templates do not cause complete replacement of the matched string. For example, the pattern \"What is the population\" gets replaced by \"NUMBERS population'.","• Before indexing the text, we process it with Textract (Byrd and Ravin, 1998; Wacholder et al., 1997), which performs lemmatization, and discovers proper names and technical terms. We added a new module (Resporator) which annotates text segments with QA-Tokens using pattern matching. Thus the text \"for 5 centuries\" matches the DURATIONS pattern \"for :CARDINAL _timeperiod\", where :CAR-DINAL is the label for cardinal numbers, and _timeperiod marks a time expression.","• GuruQA scores text passages instead of documents. We use a simple document-and collection-independent weighting scheme: QA-Tokens get a weight of 400, proper nouns get 200 and any other word - 100 (stop words are removed in query processing after the pattern template matching operation).

Next, we generate and rank each N-byte fragment based on the sentence score given by GuruQA, measures of the fragment's relevance, and the ranks of its component phrases. Unlike AnSel, Werlect was optimized through manual trial-and-error using the TR38 questions. 6.2 Step One: Feature Selection The features considered in Werlect that were also used by AnSel, were Type, Avgdst and Sscore. Two additional features were also taken into account:","NotinqW: a modified version of Notinq. As in AnSel, spans that are contained in the query are given a rank of 0. However, partial matches are weighted favorably in some cases. For example, if the question asks, \"Who was Lincoln's Secretary of State?\" a noun phrase that contains \"Secretary of State\" is more likely to be the answer than one that does not. In this example, the phrase, \"Secretary of State William Seward\" is the most likely candidate. This criterion also seems to play a role in the event that Resporator fails to identify relevant phrase types. For example, in the training question, \"What shape is a porpoise's tooth?\" the phrase \"spade-shaped\" is correctly selected from among all nouns and adjectives of the sentences returned by Guru-QA.","Frequency: how often the span occurs across different passages. For example, the test question, \"How many lives were lost in the Pan Am crash in Lockerbie, Scotland?\" resulted in four potential answers in the first two sentences returned by Guru-QA. Table 3 shows the frequencies of each term, and their eventual influence on the span rank. The repeated occurrence of \"270\", helps promote it to first place.","6.3 Step two: ranking the sentence spans After each relevant span is assigned a rank, we rank all possible text segments of 50 (or 250) bytes from the hit list based on the sum of the phrase ranks plus additional points for other words in the segment that match the query.","The algorithm used by Werlect is shown in Figure 9. 155","Initial Sentence Rank Phrase Frequency Span Rank 1 Two 5 2 1 365 million 1 3 1 11 1 4 2 270 7 1 (ranked highest) Table 3: Influence of frequency on span rank.","i.
