Adapting an IE system to a new scenario entails the construction of a new pattern base---a timeconsuming and expensive process. We have implemented a system for finding patterns automatically from un-annotated text. Starting with a small initial set of seed patterns proposed by the user, the system applies an incremental discovery procedure to identify new patterns. We present experiments with evaluations which show that the resulting patterns exhibit high precision and recall. 0 Introduction The task of Information Extraction (I-E) is the selective extraction of meaning from free natural language text. I \"Meaning\" is understood here in terms of a fixed set of semantic objects--entities, relationships among entities, and events in which entities participate. The semantic objects belong to a small number of types, all having fixed regular structure, within a fixed and closely circumscribed subject domain. The extracted objects are then stored in a relational database. In this paper, we use the nomenclature accepted in current IE literature; the term subject domain denotes a class of textual documents to be processed, e.g., \"business news,\" and scenario denotes the specific topic of interest within the domain, i.e., the set of facts to be extracted. One example of a scenario is \"management succession,\" the topic of MUC-6 (the Sixth Message Understanding Conference); in this scenario the system seeks to identify events in which corporate managers left","1For general references on IE, cf., e.g., (Pazienza, 1997; muc, 1995; muc, 1993). their posts or assumed new ones. We will consider this scenario in detail in a later section describing experiments.","IE systems today are commonly based on pattern matching. The patterns are regular expressions, stored in a \"pattern base\" containing a general-purpose component and a substantial domain- and scenario-specific component.","Portability and performance are two major problem areas which are recognized as imped-ing widespread use of IE. This paper presents a novel approach, which addresses both of these problems by automatically discovering good patterns for a new scenario. The viability of our approach is tested and evaluated with an actual IE system.","In the next section we describe the problem in more detail in the context of our IE system; sections 2 and 3 describe our algorithm for pattern discovery; section 4 describes our experimental results, followed by comparison with prior work and discussion, in section 5. 1 The IE System Our IE system, among others, contains a a backend core engine, at the heart of which is a regular-e~xpression pattern matcher. The engine draws on attendant knowledge bases (KBs) of varying degrees of domain-specificity. The KB components are commonly factored out to make the systems portable to new scenarios. There are four customizable knowledge bases in our IE system: the Lexicon contains general dictionaries and scenario-specific terms; the concept base groups terms into classes; the predicate base describes the logical structure of events to be extracted, and the pattern base contains patterns that catch the events in text.","Each KB has a. substantial domain-specific component, which must be modified when mov-282 ing to new domains and scenarios.

The system should find examples of all common linguistic constructs relevant to a scenario. While there has been prior research on identifying the primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or corpus (Grishman et al., 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process. The difficulty is that one of the best indications of the relevance of the passages is precisely the presence of these constructs.

We use the general-purpose dependency parser of English, based on the FDG formalism (Tapanainen and J~rvinen, 1997) and developed by the Research Unit for Multilingual Language Technology at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor Oy. The parser (modified to understand the name labels attached in the previous step) is used for reducing such variants as passive and relative clauses to a tuple, consisting of several elements.","1. For each claus, the first element is the subject, a \"semantic\" subject of a non-finite sentence or agent of the passive. 5 2. The second element is the verb.","3. The third element is the object, certain object-like adverbs, subject of the passive or subject complement 6","4. The fourth element is a phrase which refers to the object or the subject. A typical example of such an argument is an object complement, such as"]},{"title":"Company named John Smith","paragraphs":["president.

We used a corpus of 5,963 articles from the Wall Street Journal, randomly chosen. The parsed articles yielded a to-tal of 250,000 clausal tuples, of which 135,000 were distinct. 3.3 Generalization and Concept Classes Because tuples may not repeat with sufficient frequency to obtain reliable statistics, each tuple is reduced to a set of pairs: e.g., a verb-object pair, a subject-object pair, etc. Each pair is used as a generalized pattern during the candidate selection stage. Once we have identified pairs which are relevant to the scenario, we use them to construct or augment concept classes, by grouping together the missing roles, (for example, a class of verbs which occur with a relevant subject-object pair:"]},{"title":"\"company","paragraphs":["(hire/fire/expel...}"]},{"title":"person\").","paragraphs":["This is similar to work by several other groups which aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pereira et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993; Hirschman et al., 1975), although in .our case the contexts are limited to selected patterns, relevant to the scenario.","SE.g., \"John sleeps\", \"John is appointed by Company\", \"I saw a dog which sleeps\", \"She asked John to buy a car\".","6E.g., \"John is appointed by Company\", \"John is the president of Company\", \"I saw a dog which sleeps\", The dog which I saw sleeps.","7For example, \"She gave us our coffee black\", \"Company appointed John Smith as president\". 284 3.4 Pattern Discovery Here we present the results from experiments we conducted on the MUC-6 scenario, \"management succession\".

Thus, the discovery procedure does not o. v lend itself easily to MUC-style evaluations, since 0.6 a pattern lacks information about which events it induces and which slots its arguments should 0.5 fill.","However, it is possible to apply some objec- o. a tive measures of performance. One way we evaluated the system is by noting that in addition o. to growing the pattern set, the procedure also grows the relevance of documents. The latter o. 2 can be objectively evaluated. 0.1","We used a test corpus of 100 MUC-6 formal-training documents (which were included in the o main development corpus of about 6000 documents) plus another 150 documents picked at random from the main corpus and judged by hand. These judgements constituted the ground truth and were used only for evaluation, (not in the discovery procedure). 4.1 Text Filtering Figure 1 shows the recall/precision measures with respect to the test corpus of 250 documents, over a span of 60 generations, starting with the seed set in table 3.4. The Seed patterns matched 184 of the 5963 documents, yield-ing an initial recall of .11 and precision of .93; by the last generation it searched through 982 documents with non-zero relevance, and ended with .80 precision and .78 recall. This facet of the discovery procedure is closely related to the MUC '%ext-filtering\" sub-task, where the systems are judged at the level of documents rather than event slots. It is interesting to compare the results with other MUC-6 participants, shown anonymously in figure 2. Considering recall and precision separately, the discovery procedure at-tains values comparable to those achieved by some of the participants, all of which were either heavily-supervised or manually coded systems. It is important to bear in mind that the discovery procedure had no benefit of training material, or any information beyond the seed pattern set.","I I I I I I ......i\"{+X'N+~v i P~ecision 'i \"\" .... i ..~. i Re~aa ---×--- .......... ~ .......... ~ ......... ~ ........... ~ .......... ~ .......... ~ ......... ...... iiiiiiiiiiiiiilEi ........... ........"]},{"title":"/...","paragraphs":[".......... ~ ..........

The two plots in the figure show a slight difference in results, indicating that in some sense, the MUC corpus was more \"random\", or that our expanded corpus was somewhat skewed in favor of more common patterns that the system is able to find more easily. 4.3 Choice of Evaluation Metric The graphs shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based on an \"objective\" measure we adopted during the experiments. This is the same measure of relevance used internally by the discovery procedure on each iteration (relative to the \"truth\" of relevance scores of the previous iteration), and is not quite the standard measure used for text filtering in IR.

Similarly, if the system assigned relevance Y to an irrelevant document, it was penalized only for the mis-classified Y percent on the precision score. To make our results more comparable to those of other MUC competitors, we chose a cut-off point and force the system to make a binary relevance decision on each document. The cut-off of 0.5 seemed optimal from empirical observations. Figure 3 shows a noticeable improvement in scores, when using our continuous, \"objective\" measure, vs. the cut-off measure, with the entire graph essentially translated to the right for a gain of almost 10 percentage points of recall. 4.4 Evaluating Patterns Another effective, if simple, measure of performanceis how many of the patterns the procedure found, and comparing them with those used by an extraction engine which was manually constructed for the same task. Our MUC-6 system used approximately 75 clause level patterns, with 30 distinct verbal heads. In one conservative experiment, we observed that the discovery procedure found 17 of these verbs, or 57%. However, it also found at least 8 verbs the manual system lacked, which seemed relevant to the scenario:","company-bring-person-[as÷officer] 12"]},{"title":"person-come-[to+eompanv]-[as+oZScer]","paragraphs":["person-rejoin- company-[as + o25cer]"]},{"title":"person-{ ret , conti, e, remai, ,stay}-[as + o25cer]","paragraphs":["person-pursue-interest","At the risk of igniting a philosophical debate over what is or is not relevant to a scenario, we note that the first four of these verbs are evidently essential to the scenario in the strictest definition, since they imply changes of post.

(Yangarber and Grishman, 1997), while others have focused on methods for automatically converting a corpus annotated with extraction examples into such patterns (Lehnert et al., 1992; Fisher et al., 1995; Miller et al., 1998).

However, the prior work differs from that presented here in several crucial respects; firstly, the prior work does not at-tempt to find entire events, after the fashion of MUC's highest-level scenario-template task. Rather the patterns produced by those systems identify NPs that fill"]},{"title":"individual","paragraphs":["slots, without specifying how these slots may be combined at a later stage into complete event templates.

Secondly, the prior work either relies on a set of documents with relevance judgements to find slot fillers where they are relevant to events, (Riloff, 1996), or utilizes an un-classified corpus containing a very high proportion of relevant documents to find all instances of a semantic class, (Riloff and Jones, 1999). By contrast, our procedure requires no relevance judgements, and works on the assumption that the corpus is balanced and the proportion of relevant documents is small.

When we prepared the test corpus, it took 5 hours to mark 150 short documents.","The presented results indicate that our method of corpus analysis can be used to rapidly identify a large number of relevant patterns without pre-classifying a large training corpus. We are at the early stages of understanding how to optimally tune these techniques, and there are number of areas that need refinement. We are working on capturing the rich information about concept classes which is currently returned as part of our pattern discovery procedure, to build up a concept dictionary in tandem with the pattern base. We are also consider-ing the proper selection of weights and thresholds for controlling the rankings of patterns and documents, criteria for terminating the iteration process, and for dynamic adjustments of these weights. We feel that the generalization technique in pattern discovery offers a great opportunity for combating sparseness of data, though this requires further research. Lastly, we are studying these algorithms under several unrelated scenarios to determine to what extent scenario-specific phenomena affect their performance."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ido Dagan, Shaul Marcus, and Shaul Markovitch. 1993.
