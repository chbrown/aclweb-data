An algorithm is known that transforms any CFG into an equivalent non-left-recursive CFG, but the resulting grammars are often too large for practical use. We present a new method for removing left recursion from CFGs that is both theoretically superior to the standard algorithm, and produces very compact non-left-recursive CFGs in practice. 1 Introduction A long-standing issue regarding algorithms that manipulate context-free grammars (CFGs) in a \"top-down\" left-to-right fashion is that left recursion can lead to nontermination.

A more recent motivation is that off-the-shelf speech recognition systems are now available (e.g., from Nuance Communications and Microsoft) that accept CFGs as language models for constraining recognition; but as these recognizers process CFGs top-down, they also require that the CFGs used be non-left-recursive.","The source of the problem can be seen by considering a directly left-recursive grammar production such as A -4 As. Suppose we are trying to parse, or recognize using a speech recognizer, an A at a given position in the input. If we apply this production top-down and left-to-right, our first subgoal will be to parse or recognize an A at the same input position. This immediately puts us into an infinite recursion. The same thing will happen with an indirectly left-recursive grammar, via a chain of subgoals that will lead us from the goal of parsing or recognizing an A at a given position to a descendant subgoal of parsing or recognizing an A at that position.","In theory, the restriction to non-left-recursive CFGs puts no additional constraints on the languages that can be described, because any CFG can in principle be transformed into an equivalent non-left-recursive CFG. However, the standard algorithm for carrying out this transformation (Aho et al., 1986, pp. 176-178) (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979, p. 96)--attributed to M. C. Panll by Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p. 106)--can produce transformed grammars that are orders of magnitude larger than the original grammars. In this paper we develop a number of improvements to Panll's algorithm, which help somewhat but do not completely solve the problem. We then go on to develop an alternative approach based on the left-corner grammar transform, which makes it possible to remove left recursion with no significant increase in size for several grammars for which Paull's original algorithm is impractical. 2 Notation and Terminology Grammar nonterminals will be designated by \"low order\" upper-case letters (A, B, etc.); and terminals will be designated by lower-case letters. We will use \"high order\" upper-case letters (X, Y, Z) to denote single symbols that could be either terminals or nonterminals, and Greek letters to denote (possibly empty) sequences of terminals and/or nonterminals.

The ATIS grammar was extracted from an internally generated treebank of the DARPA ATIS3 training sentences (Dahl et al., 1994). The PT grammar 2 was extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). To these grammars we add a small \"toy\" grammar, simply because some of the algorithms cannot be run to completion on any of the \"real\" grammars within reasonable time and space bounds.","Some statistics on the test grammars are contained in Table 1. The criterion we use to judge effectiveness of the algorithms under test is the size of the' resulting grammar, measured in terms of the total number of terminal and nonterminal symbols needed to express the productions of the grammar. We use a slightly nonstandard metric, counting the symbols as if, for each nonterminal, there were a single production of the form A --+ al I ..- [ a,~. This reflects the size of files and data structures typically used to store grammars for top-down process-ing more accurately than counting a separate occurrence of the left-hand side for each distinct right-hand side.","It should be noted that the CT grammar has a very special property: none of the 535 left recursive nonterminals is indirectly left recursive. The grammar was designed to have this property specifically because Paull's algorithm does not handle indirect left recursion well.","It should also be noted that none of these grammars contains empty productions or cycles, which can cause problems for algorithms for removing left recursion. It is relatively easy to trasform an arbitrary CFG into an equivalent grammar which does not contain any of the probelmatical cases. In its initial form the PT grammar contained cycles, but these were removed at a cost of increasing the size of the grammar by 78 productions and 89 total symbols. No empty productions or cycles existed any-where else in the original grammars. 2Courtesy of Eugene Charniak, Brown University 4 Paull's Algorithm Panll's algorithm for eliminating left recursion from CFGs attacks the problem by an iterative procedure for transforming indirect left recursion into direct left recursion, with a subprocedure for eliminating direct left recursion, This algorithm is perhaps more familiar to some as the first phase of the textbook algorithm for transfomrming CFGs to Greibach norreal form (Greibach, 1965). 3 The subprocedure to eliminate direct left recursion performs the following transformation (Hopcroft and UUman, 1979, p. 96): Let"]},{"title":"A Aa11...

This is accomplished by iteratively replacing direct left corners that precede a given nonterminal with all their expansions in terms of other nonterminals that are greater in the ordering, until the nonterminal has only itself and greater nonterminals as direct left","3This has led some readers to attribute the algorithm to Greibach, but Greibach's original method was quite different and much more complicated. 250 Assign an ordering A1,..., A,~ to the nonterminals of the grammar.","for i := 1 to n do begin for j :-- 1 to i - 1 do begin","for each production of the form"]},{"title":"Ai ~ Aja","paragraphs":["do begin remove"]},{"title":"Ai -+ Aja","paragraphs":["from the grammar for each production of the form Aj -~/~ do begin","add Ai --~/~a to the grammar end end","end","transform the Ai-productions to eliminate direct left recursion","end Figure 1: Paull's algorithm.","Grammar Description Grammar Size original toy grammar 88 PA, \"best\" ordering 156 PA, lexicographical ordering 970 PA, \"worst\" ordering 5696 Table 2: Effect of nonterminal ordering on Paull's algorithm. corners.

Notice that the efficiency of PauU's algorithm crucially depends on the ordering of the nonterminals. If the ordering is reversed in the grammar of this example, Paull's algorithm will make no changes, since the grammar will already satisfy the condition that all the direct left corners of each nonterminal strictly follow that nonterminal in the revised ordering. The textbook discussions of Paull's algorithm, however, are silent on this issue.","In the inner loop of Panll's algorithm, for nonterminals"]},{"title":"Ai","paragraphs":["and Aj, such that i > j and"]},{"title":"Aj","paragraphs":["is a direct left corner of Ai, we replace all occurrences of Aj as a direct left corner of Ai with all possible expansions of"]},{"title":"Aj.","paragraphs":["This only contributes to elimination of left recursion from the grammar if"]},{"title":"Ai","paragraphs":["is a left-recursive nonterminal, and"]},{"title":"Aj","paragraphs":["]ies on a path that makes"]},{"title":"Ai","paragraphs":["left recursive; that is, if Ai is a left corner of A3 (in addition to Aj being a left corner of"]},{"title":"Ai).","paragraphs":["We could eliminate replacements that are useless in removing left recursion if we could order the nonterminals of the grammar so that, if i > j and Aj is a direct left corner of"]},{"title":"Ai,","paragraphs":["then Ai is also a left corner of Aj.

In addition, since we defined the left-corner relation to be reflexive, B is a left corner of itself.

Note that if a grammar has indirect left recursion, there will be multiple orderings consistent with our constraint, since indirect left recursion creates cycles in the the left-corner relation, so every nonterminal in one of these cycles will have the same set of left corners.

Finally, to test how bad the algorithm could be with a really poor choice of nonterminal ordering, we defined a \"worst\" ordering to be one with increasing numbers of distinct left corners. It should be noted that with either the lexicographical or worst ordering, on all of our three large grammars Panll's algorithm exceeded a cut-off of 5,000,000 grammar symbols, which we chose as being well beyond what might be considered a tolerable increase in the size of the grammar.","Let PA refer to Paull's algorithm with the nonterminals ordered according to decreasing number of distinct left corners. The second line of Table 3 shows the results of running PA on our three large grammars. The CT grammar increases only modestly in size, because as previously noted, it has no indirect left recursion. Thus the combinatorial phase of Paull's algorithm is never invoked, and the increase is solely due to the transformation applied to directly left-recursive productions. With the ATIS grammar and PT grammar, which do not have this special property, Panll's algorithm exceeded our cut-off, even with our best ordering of nonterminals.","Some additional optimizations of Panll's aglo-rithm are possible. One way to reduce the number of substitutions made by the inner loop of the algorithm is to \"left factor\" the grammar (Aho et al., 1986, pp. 178-179). The left-factoring transformation (LF) applies the following grammar rewrite schema repeatedly, until it is no longer applicable: LF: For each nonterminal A, let a be the longest nonempty sequence such that there is more than one grammar production of the form A --+ a~. Replace the set of all productions A-+aft1, ..., A-+a~n with the productions A -+ aA', A' --~ ill, ..., A' --~ fin, where A' is a new nonterminal symbol. With left factoring, for each nonterminal A there will be only one A-production for each direct left corner of A, which will in general reduce the number of substitutions performed by the algorithm.","The effect of left factoring by itself is shown in the third line of Table 3. Left factoring actually reduces the size of all three grammars, which may be unintuitive, since left factoring necessarily increases the number of productions in the grammar. However, the transformed productions axe shorter, and the grammar size as measured by total number of symbols can be smaller because common left factors are represented only once.","The result of applying PA to the left-factored grammars is shown in the fourth line of Table 3 (LF+PA). This produces a modest decrease in the size of the non-left-recursive form of the CT grammar, and brings the nomleft-recursive form of the ATIS grammar under the cut-off size, but the non-left-recursive form of the PT grammar still exceeds the cut-off.","The final optimization we have developed for Paull's algorithm is to transform the grammar to combine all the non-left-recursive possibilities for each left-recursive nonterminal under a new nonterminal symbol. This transformation, which we might call \"non-left-recursion grouping\" (NLRG), can be defined as follows: NLRG: For each left-recursive nonterminal A, let al,...,an be all the expansions of A that do not have a left recursive nonterminal as the left most symbol. If n > 1, replace the set of productions A -~ al , ..., A --~ a,~ with the productions A~A ~,A ~al, ...,A ~-~an, where A t is a new nonterminal symbol.","Since all the new nonterminals introduced by this transformation will be non-left-recursive, Paull's algorithm with our best ordering will never substitute the expansions of any of these new nonterminals into the productions for any other nonterminal, which in general reduces the number of substitutions the algorithm makes.

Johnson's second form of the LC transform can be expressed as follows, with expressions of the form A-a, A-X, and A-B being new nonterminals in the transformed grammar:","1. If a terminal symbol a is a proper left corner of A in the original grammar, add A -4 aA-a to the transformed grammar.","2. If B is a proper left corner of A and B --+ X~ is a production of the original grammar, add A-X -+ ~A-B to the transformed grammar.","3. If X is a proper left corner of A and A --+ X~ is a production of the original grammar, add A-X -+ ~ to the transformed grammar.","In Rosenkrantz and Lewis's original LC transform, schema 2 applied whenever B is a left corner of A, including all cases where B = A. In Johnson's version schema 2 applies when B -- A only if A is a proper left corner of itself. Johnson then introduces schema 3 handle the residual cases, without introducing instances of nonterminals of the form A-A that need to be allowed to derive the empty string.","The original purpose of the LC transform is to allow simulation of left-corner parsing by top-down parsing, but it also eliminates left recursion from any noncyclic CFG. 5 Fhrthermore, in the worst case, the total number of symbols in the transformed grammar cannot exceed a fixed multiple of the square of the number of symbols in the original grammar, in contrast to Paull's algorithm, which exponentiates the size of the grammar in the worst case.","Thus, we can use Johnson's version of the LC transform directly to eliminate left-recursion. Before applying this idea, however, we have one genera] improvement to make in the transform. Johnson notes that in his version of the LC transform, a new nontermina] of the form A-X is useless unless X is a proper left corner of A. We further note that a new nonterminal of the form A-X, as well as the orginal nonterminal A, is useless in the transformed grammar, unless A is either the top nonterminal of the grammar or appears on the right-hand side of an original grammar production in other than the left-most position. This can be shown by induction on the length of top-down derivations using the productions of the transformed grammar. Therefore, we will call the original nonterminals meeting this condition \"retained nontermina]s\" and restrict the LC transform so that productions involving nonterminals of the form A-X are created only if A is a retained nonterminal.","Let LC refer to Johnson's version of the LC transform restricted to retained nonterminals. In Table 4 the first three lines repeat the previously shown sizes for our three original grammars, their left-factored form, and their non-left-recursive form using our best variant of Panll's algorithm (LF+NLRG+PA). The fourth line shows the results of applying LC to the three original grammars.

This is not surprising if we note from Table 1 that almost all the productions of the PT grammar are productions for left-recursive nonterminals.

In all cases, LF+NLRG+LCLR produces more compact grammars than LF+NLRG+PA, the best variant of Paull's algorithm--slightly more compact in the case of the CT grammar, more compact by a factor of 5.9 in the case of the ATIS grammar, and more compact by at least two orders of magnitude in the case of the PT grammar. 6 Conclusions We have shown that, in its textbook form, the standard algorithm for eliminating left recursion from CFGs is impractical for three diverse, independently-motivated, natural-language grammars. We apply a number of optimizations to the algorithm--most notably a novel strategy for ordering the nonterminals of the grammar--but one of the three grammars remains essentially intractable. We then explore an alternative approach based on the LC grammar transform. With several optimizations of this approach, we are able to obtain quite compact non-left-recursive forms of all three grammars. Given the diverse nature of these grammars, we conclude that our techniques based on the LC transform are likely to be applicable to a wide range of CFGs used for natural-language processing.
