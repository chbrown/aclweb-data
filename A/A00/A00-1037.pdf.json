Even if that were possible, the knowledge is generative and there are no guarantees that a system will have the latest information all the time. And yet, if we are to build common-sense knowledge processing systems in the future, it is necessary to have general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge that is up to date. Our inability to build large knowledge bases without much effort has impeded many ANLP developments.","The most successful current Information Extraction systems rely on hand coded linguistic rules representing lexico-syntactic patterns capable of match-ing natural language expressions of events. Since the rules are hand-coded it is difficult to port systems across domains. Question answering, inference, summarization, and other applications can benefit from large linguistic knowledge bases. The basic idea A possible solution to the problem of rapid development of flexible knowledge bases is to design an automatic knowledge acquisition system that extracts knowledge from texts for the purpose of merging it with a core ontological knowledge base. The attempt to create a knowledge base manually is time consuming and error prone, even for small application domains, and we believe that automatic knowledge acquisition and classification is the only viable solution to large-scale, knowledge intensive applications.","This paper presents an interactive method that acquires new concepts and connections associated with user-selected"]},{"title":"seed","paragraphs":["concepts, and adds them to the WordNet linguistic knowledge structure (Fellbaum 1998). The sources of the new knowledge are texts acquired from the Internet or other corpora. At the present time, our system works in a semi-automatic mode, in the sense that it acquires concepts and relations automatically, but their validation is done by the user.","We believe that domain knowledge should not be acquired in a vacuum; it should expand an existent ontology with a skeletal structure built on consistent and acceptable principles. The method presented in this paper is applicable to any Machine Readable Dictionary. However, we chose WordNet because it is freely available and widely used. Related work This work was inspired in part by Marti Hearst's paper (Hearst 1998) where she discovers manually lexico-syntactic patterns for the HYPERNYMY relation in WordNet.","Much of the work in pattern extraction from texts was done for improving the performance of Information Extraction systems.

We are interested in discovering semantic relationships that link the concepts extracted above with other concepts, some of which may be in WordNet. The approach is to search for lexico-syntactic patterns comprising the concepts of interest. The semantic relations from WordNet are the first we search for, as it is only natural to add more of these relations to enhance the WordNet knowledge base.

Extract the lexico-syntactic patterns that link the two concepts. For example~ from the sentence : The graph indicates the impact on earnings from several different interest rate scenarios, the generally applicable pattern extracted is: impact on NP2 from NP1 This pattern corresponds unambiguously to the relation R we started with, namely INFLUENCE. Thus we conclude: INFLUENCE(NPI, NP2).","Another example is: As the credit worthiness decreases, the interest rate increases. From this sentence we extract another lexical pattern that expresses the INFLUENCE relation: [as NP1 vbl, NP2 vb$] & [vbl and vb2 are antonyms] This pattern is rather complex since it contains not only the lexical part but also the verb condition that needs to be satisfied.","This procedure repeats for all relations R. 2.3 Discover new relationships between","concepts Let us denote with Cs the seed-related concepts found with Procedures 1.1 through 1.3.

Part of the pattern 7 ~ are two noun phrases, one of which is Cs. The head noun from the other noun phrase is a concept Cn we are looking for. This may be a WordNet concept, and if it is not it will be added to the list of concepts discovered. Form relation R(Cs, Cn).

The Bank of Israel governor said that the ti;ht economic policy would have an immediate impact on inflation this year. As the economy picks up steam, so does inflation. Higher interest rates are normally associated with weaker bond markets. On the other hand, if interest rates go down, bonds go up, and your bond becomes more valuable. The effects of inflation on debtors and creditors varies as the actual inflation is compared to the expected one. There exists an inverse relationship between unemployment rates and inflation, best illustrated by the Phillips Curve. Irish employment is also largely a function of the past high birth rate. We believe that the Treasury bonds (and thus interest rates) are in a downward cycle.

Legend: continue lines represent influence inverse proportionally, dashed lines represent influence direct proportionally, and dotted lines represent influence (the direction of the relationship was not specified in the text).","Figure 6 shows a portion of the new domain knowledge that is relevant to these questions. The first question can be easily answered by extracting the relationships that point to the concept interest rate. The factors that influence the interest rate are Fed, inflation, economic growth, and employment.","The last two questions ask for more detailed information about the complex relationship among these concepts. Following the path from the deflation concept up to prices, the system learns that deflation in-fluences direct proportionally real interest rate, and real interest rate has an inverse proportional impact on prices. Both these relationships came from the sentence: Thus, the deflation and the real interest rate are positively correlated, and so a higher real interest rate leads to falling prices.","This method may be adapted to acquire information when the question concepts are not in the knowledge base. Procedures may be invoked to discover these concepts and the relations in which they may be used."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["The knowledge acquisition technology described above is applicable to any domain, by simply select-ing appropriate seed concepts. We started with five concepts interest rate, stock market, inflation, economic growth, and employment and from a corpus of 5000 sentences we acquired a total of 362 concepts of which 319 contain the seeds and 43 relate to these via selected relations. There were 22 distinct le:dco-syntactic patterns discovered used in 63 instances. Most importantly, the new concepts can be integrated with an existing ontology.","The method works in an interactive mode where the user accepts or declines concepts, patterns and relationships. The manual operation took on average 40 minutes per seed for the 5000 sentence corpus. KAT is useful considering that most of the knowledge base construction today is done manually.","Complex linguistic phenomena such as coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, and others have to be dealt with in order to increase the automation of the knowledge acquisition system. Without a good handling of these problems the results are not always accurate and human intervention is necessary.","References","Christiane Fellbaum.
