Anomaly detection is a method for determining which elements of a large data set do not conform to the whole. This method fits a probability distribution over the data and applies a statistical test to detect anomalous elements. In the corpus error detection problem, anomalous elements are typically marking errors. We present the results of applying this method to the tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus. 1 Introduction Manually marking corpora is a time consuming and expensive process. The process is subject to human error by the experts doing the marking. Unfortunately, many natural language processing methods are sensitive to these errors. In order to ensure accuracy in a corpus, typically several experts pass over the corpus to ensure consistency. For large corpora this can be a tremendous expense.","In this paper, we propose a method for automatically detecting errors in a marked corpus using an anomaly detection technique. This technique detects anomalies or elements which do not fit in with the rest of the corpus. When applied to marked corpora, the anomalies tend to be errors in the markings of the corpus.","To detect the anomalies, we first compute a probability distribution over the entire corpus. Then we apply a statistical test which identifies which elements are anomalies. In this case the anomalies are the elements with very low likelihood. These elements are marked as errors and are thrown out of the corpus. The model is recomputed on the remaining elements. At conclusion, we are left with two data sets: one the normal elements and the second the detected anomalous elements.","We evaluate this method over the part of speech tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). In one experiment, our method detected 1000 anomalies within a data set of 1.25 million tagged elements. Human judges evaluated the results of the application of this method and verified that 69% of identified anomalies are in fact tagging errors. In another experiment, our method detected 4000 anomalies of which 44% are tagging errors. 1.1 Related Work The tagged portion of the Penn Treebank has been extensively utilized for construction and evaluation of taggers. This includes transformation-based tagging (Brill, 1994; Brill and Wu, 1998). Weischedel et al. (1993) applied Markov Models to tagging. Abney et al. (1999) applied boosting to part of speech tagging. Adwait Ratnaparkhi (1996) estimates a probability distribution for tagging using a maximum entropy approach.","Regarding error detection in corpora, Ratnaparkhi (1996) discusses inconsistencies in the Penn Treebank and relates them to inter-annotator differences in tagging style. Abney, Schapire and Singer (1999) discuss how to use boosting for cleaning data.","Much related work to the anomaly detection problem stems from the field of statistics in the study of outliers. This work examines detecting and dealing with outliers in univariate data, multivariate data, and structured data where the probability distribution over the data is given a priori. Statistics gives a set of discordancy tests which can be applied to any given element in the dataset to determine whether it is an outlier. A survey of outliers in statistics is 148 given in Barnett and Lewis (1994).","Anomaly detection is extensively used within the field of computer security specifically in intrusion detection (Denning, 1987). Typically anomaly detection methods are applied to detect attacks by comparing the activity during an attack to the activity under normal use (Lane and Brodley, 1997; Warrender et al., 1999). The method used in this paper is based on a method for anomaly detection which detects anomalies in noisy data (Eskin, 2000).","The sparse Markov transducer probability modeling method is an extension of adaptive mixtures of probabilistic transducers (Singer, 1997; Pereira and Singer, 1999). Naive Bayes learning, which is used to estimate probabilities in this paper, is described in (Mitchell, 1997). 2 Anomaly Detection More formally, anomaly detection is the process of determining when an element of data is an outlier. Given a set of training data without a probability distribution, we want to construct an automatic method for detecting anomalies. We are interested in detecting anomalies for two main reasons. One, we are interested in modeling the data and the anomalies can contaminate the model. And two, the anomalies themselves can be of interest as they may show rarely occurring events. For the purposes of this work, we axe most interested in identifying mistagged elements, i.e. the second case.","In order to motivate a method for detecting anomalies, we must first make assumptions about how the anomalies occur in the data. We use a \"mixture model\" for explaining the presence of anomalies, one of several popular models in statistics for explaining outliers (Barnett and Lewis, 1994). In the mixture model, there are two probability distributions which generate the data. An element xi is either generated from the majority distribution or with (small) probability A from an alternate (anomalous) distribution. Our distribution for the data, D, is then: D -- (1 - A)M + AA (I) where M is the majority distribution, and A is the anomalous distribution. The mixture framework for explaining anomalies is independent of the properties of the distributions M and A. In other words, no assumptions about 149 the nature of the probability distributions are necessary. The specific probability distributions, M and A, are chosen based on prior knowledge of the problem. Typically M is a structured distribution which is estimated over the data using a machine learning technique, while A is a uniform (random) distribution representing elements which do not fit into M.","In the corpus error detection problem, we are assuming that for each tag in the corpus with probability (1 - A) the human annotator markes the corpus with the correct tag and with probability A the human annotator makes an error. In the case of an error, we assume that the tag is chosen at random. 2.1 Detection of Anomalies Detecting anomalies, in this framework, is equivalent to determining which elements were generated by the distribution A and which elements were generated by distribution M. Ele-ments generated by A are anomalies, while elements generated by M are not. In our case, we have probability distributions associated with the distributions M and A, PM and PA respectively.","The algorithm partitions the data into two sets, the normal elements M and the anomalies A. For each element, we make a determination of whether it is an anomaly and should be included in A or a majority element in which it should be included in M. We measure the likelihood of the distribution under both cases to make this determination.","The likelihood, L, of distribution D with probability function P over elements Xl,...,XN is defined as follows:","N L(D) = l'I PD(Xi) ="]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["i-----1","Since the product of small numbers is difficult to compute, we instead compute the log likelihood, LL. The log likelihood for our case is:","LL(D) = IMI log(1 - A) + ~[] log(PM(xi)) xiEM","+lAIlogA + ~ log(PA(xj)) (3) xj EA","In order to determine which elements are anomalies, we use a general principal for determining outliers in multivariate data (Barnett, 1979). We measure how likely each element xi is an outlier by comparing the difference between the log likelihood of the distribution if the element is removed from the majority distribution and included in the anomalous distribution. If this difference is sufficiently large, we declare the element an anomaly.","Specifically what this difference should be depends on the probability distributions and prior knowledge of the problem such as the rate of the anomalies, A. 3 Methodology 3.1 Corpus The corpus we use is the Penn Treebank tagged corpus. The corpus contains approximately 1.25 million manually tagged words from Wall Street Journal articles. For each word, a record is generated containing the following elements: 1. The tag of the current word Ti. 2. The current word Wi. 3. The previous tag ~-I. 4. The next tag 7~+1. Over records containing these 4 elements, we compute our probability distributions. 3.2 Probability Modeling Methods The anomaly detection framework is independent of specific probability distributions. Different probability distributions have different properties. Since the anomaly detection framework does not depend on a specific probability distribution, we can choose the probability distribution to best model the data based on our intuitions about the problem.","To illustrate this, we perform two sets of experiments, each using a different probability distribution modeling method. The first set of experiments uses sparse Markov transducers as the probability modeling method, while the second uses a simple naive Bayes method. 3.3 Sparse Markov Transducers Sparse Markov transducers compute probabilistic mappings over sparse data.

In a variable order Markov Chain, the value of n changes depending on the context. For example, some elements in the data may use a bigram, while others may use a trigram. The sparse Markov transducer uses a weighted sum of n-grams for different values of n and these weights depend on the context. In addition the weighted sum is over not only n-grams, but also n-grams with wild cards such as a trigram where only the first and last element is conditioned on.","In this case we are 'looking at the input sequence of the current word,"]},{"title":"Wt,","paragraphs":["the previous tag,"]},{"title":"Tt-1,","paragraphs":["and the next tag,"]},{"title":"Tt+l.","paragraphs":["The output is the set of all possible tags.

This predictor computes the probability of an output (tag) by the number of times that a specific output was seen in a given context. In order to avoid probabilities of 0, we assume that we have seen each output at least once in every context. In fact, these predictors can be any probability distribution which can also depend on what works best for the task. 3.4 Naive Bayes The probability distribution for the tags was also estimated using a straight forward naive Bayes approach.","We are interested in the probability of a tag, given the current word, the previous tag, and the next tag, or the probability distribution P(TiIWi, Ti-t, ~+1) which using Bayes Rule is equivalent"]},{"title":"to:","paragraphs":["P(Ti}Wi, Ti-l, Ti+ l ) ="]},{"title":"P(Wi, Ti-I, Ti+zlTi)","paragraphs":["* P(Ti) P(Wi, Ti-,,Ti+I) (6) If we make the Naive Bayes independence as-sumption and we assume that the denominator is constant for all values this reduces to:"]},{"title":"P(~IW~, ~-1, Ti+,) = P(WiIT~) * P(T~-IIT~) * P(Ti+zlTi)","paragraphs":["*"]},{"title":"P(Ti) (7) C","paragraphs":["where C is a normalization constant in order to have the probabilities sum to 1.

These anomalies were evaluated by human judges to determine if they are in fact tagging errors in the corpus. The human judges were natural language processing researchers (not the author) familiar with the Penn Treebank markings.","In the experiments involving the sparse Markov transducers, after applying the method, 7055 anomalies were detected. In the experiments involving the naive Bayes learning method, 6213 anomalies were detected.","Sample output from the system is shown in figure 1. The error is shown in the context marked with !!!. The likelihood of the tag is also given which is extremely low for the errors. The system also outputs a suggested tag and its likelihood which is the tag with the highest likelihood for that context. As we can see, these errors are clearly annotation errors.","Since the anomalies detected from the two probability modeling methods differed only slightly, we performed human judge verification of the errors over only the results of the sparse Markov transducer experiments.","The anomalies were ordered based on their likelihood. Using this ranking, the set of anomalies were broken up into sets of 1000 records. We examined the first 4000 elements by randomly selecting 100 elements out of each 1000.","Human judges were presented with the system output for four sets of 100 anomalies. The judges were asked to choose among three options for each example:","1. Corpus Error- The tag in the corpus sentence is incorrect.","2.

System Error - The tag in the corpus sentence is correct and the system incorrectly marked it as an error. The \"unsure\" choice was allowed because of the inherent subtleties in differentiating between types of tags such as \"VB vs. VBP\" or \"VBD vs. VBN\".","Over the 400 examples evaluated, 158 were corpus errors, 202 were system errors and the judges were unsure in 40 of the cases. The corpus error rate was computed by throwing out the unsure cases and computing: Corpus error rate = (8)","Corpus Errors System Errors + Corpus Errors The total corpus error rate over the 400 manually checked examples was was 44%. As can be seen, many of the anomalies are in fact errors in the corpus.","For each error, we asked the human judge to determine if the correct tag is the systems suggested tag. Out of the total 158 corpus errors, the systems correct tag would have corrected the error in 145 cases.","Since the verified examples were random, we can assume that 91% of corpus errors would be automatically corrected if the system would replace the suspect tag with the suggested tag. Ignoring the \"unsure\" elements for the purposes of this analysis, if we attempted to automatically correct the first 1000 examples where the error rate was 69%, this method would have led to a reduction of the total number of errors in the corpus by 245. 5 Conclusion This paper presents a fully automatic method for detecting errors in corpora using anomaly detection techniques. As shown, the anomalies detected in the Penn Treebank corpus tend to be tagging errors.","This method has some inherent limitations because not all errors in the corpus would manifest themselves as anomalies. In infrequent contexts or ambiguous situations, the method may not have enough information to detect an error. In addition, if there are inconsistencies between annotators, the method would not detect the errors because the errors would be manifested over a significant portion of the corpus.","Although this paper presents a fully automatic method for error detection in corpora, this method can also be used as a semi-automatic method for correcting errors. The method can guide an annotator to the elements which are most likely errors. The method can greatly reduce the number of elements that an annotator needs to examine.","Future work in this area involves modeling the corpora with other probability distributions. 152"]},{"title":"Anoma~ Rank Corpus Errors System Error","paragraphs":["Unsure"]},{"title":"Corpus Error Rate","paragraphs":["1-1000 63 28 9 69% 1001-2000 36 54 i0 40% 2001-3000 18 70 12 20% 3001-4000 41 50 9 45% Totals 158 202 40 44% Table 1: Results of error detection experiments on the tagged portion of the Penn Treebank The method is very sensitive to the effectiveness of the probability model in modeling the normal elements.
