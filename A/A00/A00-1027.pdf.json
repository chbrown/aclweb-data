This paper presents an effective method of Korean compound noun segmentation based on lexical data extracted from corpus. The segmentation is done by two steps: First, it is based on manually constructed built-in dictionary for segmentation whose data were extracted from 30 million word corpus. Second, a segmentation algorithm using statistical data is proposed, where simple nouns and their frequencies are also extracted from corpus. The analysis is executed based on CYK tabular parsing and min-max operation. By experiments, its accuracy is about 97.29%, which turns out to be very effective."]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["Introduction Morphological analysis is crucial for processing the agglutinative language like Korean since words in such languages have lots of morphological variants. A sentence is represented by a sequence of eojeols which are the syntactic unit~ delimited by spacing characters in Korean.

In particular, since an eojeol can often contain more than one noun, we cannot get proper interpretation of the sentence or phrase without its accurate segmentation.","The problem in compound noun segmentation is that it is not possible to register all compound nouns in the dictionary since nouns are in the open set of words as well as the number of them is very large. Thus, they must be treated as unseen words without a segmentation process. Furthermore, accurate compound noun segmentation plays an important role in the application system.

Our segmentation algorithm is based on a large collection of lexical information that consists of two kinds of data: One is the hand built segmentation dictionary (HBSD) and the other is the simple noun dictionary for segmentation (SND). 2.1 Hand-Built Segmentation Dictionary The first phase of compound noun segmentation uses the built-in dictionary (HBSD). The advantage of using the built-in dictionary is that the segmentation could (1) be very accurate by hand-made data and (2) become more efficient.

Besides, we can treat general spacing errors using the dictionary. By the spacing rule for Korean, there should be one content word except noun in an eojeol, but it turns out that one or more content words of short length sometimes appear without space in real texts, which causes the lexical ambiguities.

Thus, a large size of corpus should be used to extract proper frequencies of nouns.

Empirically, it is well-known that too many words in the dictionary have a bad influence on morphological analysis in Korean. It is because rarely used nouns result in oversegmentation if they are included in compound noun segmentation dictionary. There-fore, it is necessary to select distinct nouns, which leads us to use a part of corpus instead of entire corpus that consists of frequently used ones in the corpus.","First, we examined distribution of eojeols in corpus in order to make the subset of corpus to extract lexical frequencies of nouns. The notable thing in our experiment is that the number of eojeols in corpus is increased in proportion to the size of corpus, but a small portion of eojeols takes most parts of the whole corpus. For instance, 70% of the corpus consists of just 60 thousand types of eojeols which take 7.5 million of frequency from 10 million eojeol corpus and 20.5 million from 30 million eojeols. The lowest frequency of the 60,000 eojeols is 49 in 30 million eojeol corpus. We decided to take 60,000 eojeols which are manually tractable and compose most parts of corpus (Figure 1).","Second, we made morphological analyses for the 60,000 eojeols by hand. Since Korean is an agglutinative language, an eojeol is represented by a sequence of content words and functional words as mentioned before. Especially, content words and functional words often have different distribution of syllables. In addition, inflectional endings for predicate and postpositions for nominals also have quite different distribution for syllables.

A compound noun 'geon-chugsa-si-heom' is composed of 'geon-chug-sa' and 'si-heom', which have the meanings of authorized architect and examination. In this case, the unknown noun is caused by the suffix such as 'sa' because the suffix derives many words.

The string might be a proper noun itself. For example, 'willi'amseu' is a transliterated word for foreign name 'Williams' and 'hong-gil-dong' is a personal name in Korean.

It is known that the performance drops if all nouns in the compound noun segmentation dictionary are considered for default segmentation. We save the pointer to the boundary only when a noun in distinct set appears. For the above example 'geon-chug-sa-si-heom', the default segmentation would be 'geon-chug-sa' and 'si-heom' since 'si-heom' is in the set of distinct nouns and the pointer is set before 'si-heom' (Figure 5). 201 /* initialization step */ for i----1 to n do for j=l to n-i+l do"]},{"title":"value(Ci,j) = Word(st...","paragraphs":["sj+i-1);"]},{"title":"MLS(Ci,j) = st...","paragraphs":["sj+~-i ; if"]},{"title":"value(Ci,j) > 0","paragraphs":["¢; otherwise for i=2 to n do for j= 1 to i do"]},{"title":"value( Ci,j ) = max(min( value( Ci_l,j ), value( C1j+i_l ) ), min (value( Ci- 2,j ) , value( C2,j_ 2 ) ) ,","paragraphs":["min(va[ue(Cl,j),value(Ci_,,j+l)),"]},{"title":"Word(st... s~+~)) M LS( Ci,j ) = arg max(min(value( Ci_lj), value( Cij+i_l ) ), min( value( Ci_ 2j ) , value( C2j_ 2 ) ) , Word(s~ . , . si+j)):","paragraphs":[",",",,,,,",",",", , ,% ......",",",",",",",", Figure 4: The segmentation algorithm","If this procedure is failed, the sequence of syllables is checked whether it might be proper noun or not.

From the results, we can find that the distinct nouns has great impact on compound noun segmentation. Also, the overall segmentation accuracy for the gold standard is about 97.29% which is a very good result for the application system. In addition, it shows that the built-in dictionary supplements the algorithm which results in better segmentation.","Lastly, we compare our system with the previous work by (Yun"]},{"title":"et al. ,","paragraphs":["1997). It is impossible that we directly compare our result with theirs, since the test set is different. It was reported that the accuracy given in the paper is about 95.6%. When comparing the performance only in terms of the accuracy, our system outperforms theirs.","Embeded in the morphological analyzer, the compound noun segmentater is currently being used for some projects on MT and IE which are worked in several institutes and it turns out that the system is very effective."]},{"title":"202","paragraphs":["Number of correct constituents Rate Precision 3553/3628","98.04 Recall","3553/3637 97.80 Table 3: Result 1: Precision and recall rate SA Number of correct constituents Rate","Whole System Baseline 1726]1774 1673/1774","97.29 94.30 Table 4: Result 2: Segmentation accuracy for Compound Noun 5 Conclusions In this paper, we presented the new method for Korean compound noun segmentation. First, we proposed the lexical acquisition for compound noun analysis, which consists of the manually constructed segmentation dictionary (HBSD) and the dictionary for applying the segmentation algorithm (SND). The hand-built segmentation dictionary was made manually for compound nouns extracted from corpus. The simple noun dictionary is based on very frequently occurring nouns which are called distinct nouns because they are clues for identifying constituents of compound nouns. Second, the compound noun was segmented based on the modification of CYK tabular parsing and min-max composition, which was proven to be the very effective method by experiments. The bottom up approach using min-max operation guarantees the most likely segmentation, being applied in the same way as dynamic programming.","With our new method, the result for segmentation is as accurate as 97.29%. Especially, the algorithm made results good enough and the built-in dictionary supplemented the algorithm. Consequently, the methodology is promising and the segmentation system would be helpful for the application system such as machine translation and information retrieval."]},{"title":"6","paragraphs":["Acknowledgement We thank Prof. Mansuk Song at Yonsei Univ. and Prof. Key-Sun Choi at KAIST to provide data for experiments.","References","Cha, J., Lee, G. and Lee, J. 1998.
