The major components of Lucy are a syntax-based parser (Wittenburg, 1986), a semant=c translation system, a pronominal anaphora resolution system (which will be described in this paper) and a pragmatic processor. The parser p..roduces as !ts output a feature graph that descnoes the syntacticpropenies ov the constituents of the sen(ence. The semantic translation system produces as its output a list of discourse referents and a set of assertions about them. The job of the anaphora resolution system is to augment this assertion set with additional assertions that describe coreference relations between discourse referents. Figure 1 shows the results of semantic processing and anaphora resolution for the simple discourse, \"Dave created a file. He printed it.\" A DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE","Designing an anaphora resolution system is difficult because there exists no single, coherent theory upon which to build, even =f we restrict our attention to pronominal anaphora (which we will do throughout this paper). There do, however, exist many partial theories, 1 each of which accounts for a subset of the phenomena that influence the use and interpretation of pronominal anaphora. These partial theories range from purely syntactic ones (for example the simple rules of number and gender agreement) to highly semantic and pragmatic ones that account for focusing phenomena. If there were a single, complete theory, then it might be appropriate to implement it. If there were no theories at all, then an ad hoc im-"]},{"title":"p","paragraphs":["lementation might be the only alternative. But ecause there are partial theones but not a complete one, we have designed an architecture (patterned after the idea of a blackboard system (Erman, 1981)) that allows for a loosely coupled set of modules, each of which handles a subset of discourse phenomena by implementing a specific partial theory. These modules communicate by proposing candidate antecedents and by evaluating each other's proposals. An oversight module, called the handler, mediates these communications and resolves conflicts among the modules.","All the modules in this system share a common representation of the current discourse. This representation is called the core discourse structure. It includes a list of the discourse referents that have so far been introduced. As-sociated with each such referent is a set of assertions, including syntactic facts about the use of the referent (e.g., its number and gender and whether or not it is reflexive), semantic facts (such as the ones shown in Figure 1), and anaphoric usage facts such as coextension relations.","A schematic view of the architecture is shown in Figure 2. Each of the ovals in the figure represents an implementation of one of the partial theories of anaphora. Each of these implementations is called a constraint source (CS), because each of them is viewed as imposing a set of consiraints on the choice of an antecedent for a pronominal referent.","el: (create el) e2: (pdnt e2) (agent el xt ) (agent e2 x3) (object el x2) (object e2 x4) xl : (= xl Dave) x3: x2: (file x2) x4: (a) The Result of Semantic Processing","1All existing theories are partial in the added sense of being fallible.

These component functions are","called at different times during the process of","anaphor resolution, but they form a logical unit","since they share knowledge structures that cor-","respond to the particular partial theory that is","implemented by the CS to which they belong.","The four functions are the following: • Modeller - This function maintains the CS's local model of the ongoing discourse. Not all CS's need such a model. Simple syntactic ones like number agreement typically do not build a local model since all the information they need is available in the core discourse structure and in the anaphoric referent being resolved. But CS's that describe more global phenomena, such as rhetorical structure may need access to informat on that is neither local to a particular referent nor contained in the core discourse structure. If a local model is built, it is built to rest top core on of the shared discourse structure. Thecontent of the local model is accessible to the other functions of the same CS but not to anyone else. • Constraint poster - This function posts constraints that describe interactions among anaphora within a sentence. .These constra~nts are then treated in exactly the same way as are semantic assertions about the referents. The algorithm for resolving anaphora (which will be described below) ap-I~lies to a single anaphoric referent at a time. But, in some sentences, there are interactions among referents that make it impossible to treat them completely separately. By posting interaction constraints before processing individual anaphoric referents, we maintain the ability to treat the referents separately but also to guarantee that the complete interpretation for the sentence in which they occur will be consistent. As an example of this"]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["henomenon, consider the sentence, \"He saw im.\" Disjoint reference could post a constraint that he and him cannot co-refer before any attempt is made to find the antecedent for either of them. Most simple constraint sources do nothing when their constraint posters are called. • Proposer - This function takes as input an anaphoric referent and returns as its output a list of candidate antecedents, each with an associated score (which will be described later). For example, recency proposes all referents in the two most recent previous sentences, as well as any in the current sentence that occur to the left of the referent that is being resolved. Some CS's, such as number agreement, never propose candidates. • Evaluator - This function takes as input an anaphor and a candidate antecedent for that anaphor. The evaluator returns a score in-dicating strength of support for that candidate as antecedent to the anaphor. The returned score is based solely on the information available to the CS that ~s doing the evaluation. It is left to the handler, which invokes the various CS's, to combine scores from different evaluators and to resolve conflicts. Although every CS must be able to respond whenever its evaluator is called, there is a score that will be interpreted to mean, \"1 have no opinion.\" (See below.)"]},{"title":"THE ANAPHORA RESOLUTION PROCEDURE","paragraphs":["In the current implementation of Lucy, anaphora resolution occurs once semantic inter-19","pretation is complete. 2 The procedure","resolve-anaphors does the following for each","sentence that is to be understood: 1. Update the core discourse structure with the results of syntactic and semantic processing of the current sentence. 2. For each CS in the system, invoke the modeller and the constraint poster. 3. For each anaphor in the sentence do:","a. Invoke the anaphora resolution hand-","ler, which will in turn invoke the","PrrOposers and evaluators for all CS's.","he output of the handler is a list of","ordered pairings of possible antece-","dents with their overall scores.","b. Invoke select-best-antecedent, which","will decide whether there is enough","evidence to make a coextension","assertion and, if so, will add the asser-","tion to the core discourse structure","and to both anaphor and antecedent","referents. The anaphora resolution handler takes two","inputs: an ordered list of available CS's and the","anaphoric referent that needs to be resolved.","The handler exploits a local data structure called","CANDIDATES, which is reinitialized for each","anaphoric referent that is processed and which","contains a list of all the antecedents that have","been proposed for that referent. This makes it","possible to avoid considering any given can-","didate more than once, no matter how often it is","proposed. The handler proceeds as follows: 1. For each CS(i) do:","a. Invoke CS(i)'s proposer, which will","return a list (possibly empty) of can-","didate antecedents, each with an as-","sociated initial score.","b. For each candidate C that is not al-","ready on CANDIDATES do:","i. Add C to CANDIDATES.","ii. While running score of C is","above threshold, for each CS(j)","where j ~ i do:","1. Pass C to the evaluator to","get a score.","2. Update running score for C. Although these algorithms do not care, in","some sense, what list of constraint sources they","are given, their success depends on having a","set of constraint sources thatcover the range of","phenomena that occur in the discourse that","must be processed. Also, the efficiency with","which they reach a conclusion depends on the","order in which the CS's are invoked. In Lucy,","the recency constraint source is invoked first.","The correct antecedent is almost always among","the candidates recency proposes since it","proposes liberally. To aidefficiency, the recency","CS is followed immediately by the simple syn-","2In future releases, a more flexible control structure will be exploited. tactic filtering CS's (number, gender and animacy agreement) wh=ch, with little effort and high certainty, are able to eliminate most candidates from the list that must be evaluated by more complex CS's.","The select-best-antecedent procedure applies to the final list of candidate antecedents. It must decide whether there is sufficient information on which to base a coreference assertion. If there is exactly one candidate with the highest rating and if the difference between that ratingand the second highest rating exceeds the threshold 5 (a system parameter currently set at 0.5), then a coreference assertion can be made. 3 If one candidate is not cleady best, however, two actions are possible. One ~s to do nothing (i.e., post no coreference constraint) and thus essentially to produce a partial interpretation of the input sentence. This may be accept-able, depending on the use to which the sentence's interpretation is to be put. For example, it may be possible to wait until subsequent sentences are processed to see if they yield the disambiguating information. If waiting ~s unacceptable, however, the other available action is to query the user who input the sentence. This option is available since Lucy is being designed to serve as an interactive Enghsh front end system; if this same approach were to be used during text comprehension, some alternative, such as choose a candidate and be prepared to back up if necessary, would be requ=red instead."]},{"title":"THE CANDIDATE","paragraphs":["SCORING"]},{"title":"PROCEDURE","paragraphs":["As we just saw, the final selection of an antecedent from among the set of candidate referents depends on the combined score that is attached to each candidate as a result of the examination of the candidate by the entire set of constraint sources. Thus the design of the scoring procedure has an important effect on the outcome of the resolution process. Our first implementation of this procedure exploited a single score, a number in the range -5 to +5. Each CS gave each candidate a score and the handler averaged the individual scores to form a composite score. The major drawback of this simple scheme is that there is no way for a CS to say, \"1 have no opinion,\" since any score it gives necessarily changes the composite score. There is also no way to say, \"1 have an opinion and here it is, (and I'm very)/(but rm not at all) confident of it.\" As a result, the system was highly unstable. It could be tuned to perform fa=rly well,","3In the current implementation, the value of 8 does not matter very much, since the available CS's provide only very weak preferences or absolute filtering. Future CS's will exploit more domain knowledge to provide more accurate preferences. 2,0 but whenever a new CS was added or if a CS was changed even slightly, the whole system had to be retuned.","To remedy these problems, we now use a scoring procedure in which each CS provides both a score and a confidence measure. The score is a number in the range -5 to +5, the confidence a number in the range 0 to 1. The function that combines a set of n (score, confidence) pairs is","It ~, score(Oxconfidence(O i=1","running score = II confidence(t) i=1 This function computes an average that is","weighted not by the number of distinct scores","but by the total confidence expressed for the","scores. Any CS that wishes to assert no opinion","can now do so by giving a confidence of 0 to its","opinion, which will then have no effect on a","candidate's running score. Although, in principle, a constraint source","may function both as a proposer and as an","evaluator and it may assign any","(score, confidence) value it likes to a candidate,","it turns out that the CS's that have been imple-","mented so far are much more limited in their","behavior. Most CS's either propose or evaluate,","but not both. And there are patterns of","(score, confidence) values that appear to be par-","ticularly useful. Each CS that has been imple-","mented so far falls into one of the following four","classes: • Finite set generators (such as disjoint reference when applied to a reflexive pronoun) are constraint sources that propose a fixed set of candidates. They assign all such candidates the same score and that score is a function of the number of competing candidates: # of candidates (score, confidence) contribution to propose of this CS","1 (5.1) =5","2 (4, 1) =4","3 (3, 1) =3 These CS's never evaluate (i.e., when asked to do so, they return a confidence of 0.) • Fading infinite set generators (such as recency) are constraint sources that could keep proposing, perhaps indefinitely, but with lower and lower scores. Recency, for example, uses the following scoring: Sentence (score, confidence) contribution","of this CS","n (current) (1, 0.5) = 2","n-1 (2, 0.5) = 1","n-2 (0, 0.5) = 0 These CS's never evaluate. • Filters (such as number and gender agreement) are constraint sources that never propose candidates. They serve only to filter out candidates that fail to meet specific re-"]},{"title":"fquirements","paragraphs":["(usually syntactic). Filters use the otlowing two assignments when they evaluate candidates:","(score, confidence) contribution","of this CS pass (0 4, 0) = 0 fail (-5, 0.9) = -5 These scores have the following effects: • pass - Since the confidence level is 0, the","score does not matter and no change will","be made to the composite score as a result","of the evaluator being called. Thus a","candidate's score is insensitive to the num-","ber of filter CS's that it passes. • fail - The low score with high confidence","forces the composite score to drop below","the minimum threshold eliminating this can-","didate from future consideration. • Preferences (such as semantic content consistency) are constraint sources that impose preferences, rather than absolute opinions, on a set of candidates ratingeach member relative to others in the set. These constraint sources may use the full range of (score, confidence) values. Although the scoring scheme we have just","described exploits more knowledge about a","CS's opinion than did our first, simpler one, it is","not perfect.

CONSTRAINT SOURCE EXAMPLES","In this section, we describe the constraint sources that have been implemented in Lucy as well as some (preceded by an asterisk) that are envisioned but not yet implemented.","Recency, whose function is to propose referents that have occurred in the recently preceding discourse.

For example, consider the discourse, \"The system created an error log.

Further, this CS will reject the system as the antecedent of the second occurrence of it, assuming that the type hierarchy does not include system as a subclass of information-structure.","Global Focus, which knows about objects that are globally salient throughout a discourse. In the current implementation, global Focus acts only when the anaphor being considered is it. In that case, it proposes as antecedents all referents that are in global focus.

Logical accessibilty functions only as a filter.

CONCLUSION","In this paper, we have described an architecture for pronominal anaphora resolution that allows implementations of partial theories of anaphora to be combined into a complete system, and we have illustrated an implementabon of such a system. This architecture makes no commitment on the question of what theories should be used or how conflicts among the theories should be resolved. In this respect, it differs from other proposals (such as (Hobbs, 1978)) in which a specific strategy for applying knowledge is encoded into the control structure of the system. As a result of its loose structure, this architecture supports the empirical investigation of the effectiveness of competing theories and their implementations within a complete anaphora resolution system.","One interesting comment that can be made about this architecture is its similarity to architectures that have been used to perform other parts of the natural language understanding task. For example, TEAM (-Grosz, 1987) uses a similar architecture and a set of critics to .perform.quandrier scope assignment. The criucs Tuncfion in much the same way CS's do. And, like CS's, there are classes of critics. For example, some are pure filters. Others impose preferences on the set of candidate interpretations."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDG EMENTS","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Nicholas Asher, Kent Wittenburg, Dave Wroblewski, Jim Barnett, Jon Schlossberg, and Carl Weir for many discussions about this architecture.
