The project, covering Bulgarian and Czech, two ti'ee-word-order languages from the Slavic t~rnily, was performed between January 1993 and mid 1996 by a consortium consisting of both academic and industrial partners.","The basic philosophy of the technology discussed in this paper 1 is that of linguistic-theoretically smmd grammar-and-parsing-based machinery able to detect, by constraint relaxation, errors from a predefined set (as opposed to pattern-matching approaches, which do not seem promising for a free word-order language). The core of the system (broad-coverage HPSG-based grammars of Bulgarian and Czech, and a single language-independent parser) was developed m the first three years of the project and was then passed to the industrial partners Bulgarian Business System IMC Sofia. and Macron Prague, Ltd. While the Bulgarian system remained in more or less a demonstrator stage only, the Czech one satisfied Macron's requirements as to syntactic coverage. However, Macron expressed serious worries about the speed of the system, should this be really introduced to the market. Following this, severa.1 possibili-","IAs for the alterna.tive technology, cf.

'remelnbers' its nature so that in tile tbllowmg phases, only the respect,ive constrailltS are relaxed (which helps to cut down the search space, a.s compa.red to reparsing with relaxing of all predefined-errors-related constraints) As an example of this idea, let us consider a system deMing with errors in subject-verb agreement in Czech (and taking - for the very purpose of this example - detection of no other errors into account). Since the realistic pa.rt of such errors in Czech is the '-I/-Y' dichotomy on homophonic past tense verb endings occurring on plural verbs ('-I' ending sta.ndrag with l:)lural masculine animate subjects, '-Y ending with plural masculine inanimate and feminine subjects), the preprocessing finite-state automaton marks all sentences not conta.ining any of these forms (i.e. all sentences containing only singular verbs, or plural verbs but in present tense or in neuter gender, or infinite verb tbrms) as 'containing no detectable error', without any actual grammar-checking taking place (it is, however, obvious that this does not necessarily mea.n that the sentences are truly correct - they just do not contain the kind of error the system is able to detect)."]},{"title":"3 Alternative Error-Classification and Error Search by Finite Automata","paragraphs":["Another important step towards tile apl)lication of FSA to error-detection was developing a new dimension of cl~ussitication of errors to be detected: apart fi'om the lnore standard criteria of frequency a.nd lmrforlnance/conqmtence, we developed a scale based on the comI~lexit, y of the forlnal appara.tus needed for the detection of the particular error type (as for error typology developed for the purpose of the error detection techniques used in the l)roject, of. (l%odrignez Selles, GMvez, and Oliva, 1996)). On t, he one end of this sca.le were errors recognizable within a strictly local context, such as COmlnas missing in front of a certain kind of complementizers (subordinating conjunctions) or incorrect vocalization of a preposition (in both Bulgarian and C, zech, certain prepositions ending norlnally with a. consonant get, ~t supporting w)cal m case the word that follows them also starts with a. consonant - the parMlel in English would be the opt)osition between the two forms a and an of the indefinite article). On the other elm of the scale we put, e.g., the general case of subject-verb ~greement, errors. Pra.ctically lllOl'e imtn.~rtallt was tile question whether there exists a, (:lass of errors with complexity of detection lying between the \"trivial errors\" and the errors tor tile detection of which a fldl-fledged analysis is necessa.ry - in other words, the question whether there exist some errors for the recognition of which","• on the one hand, a limited local context is msuf","ficient (i.e. it is necessa.ry tot this end to process","a substring of length which ca.nnot be set in a.d-","vance, in generM the whole input string),","• on the other hand, it is not necessary t.o use the","power of the fldl-fledged parser, al,d, in parti-","cular, it is sufficient to use the power of a fi-","nite state autolnaton or only slight augmenta.-","lion thereof. Following some linguistic research, two such error types have been selected for implenlentation, and while one of thenr is just a lnarginal subtype of an error in subject-verb agreernent, the other is an error type of its own, and in addition one of really crucial importance tot practical gramma.r-checking due to its high frequency of occurrence.","Tile forlner error to be detected by the l~init,e state machinery is a particular instance of an error where a plural masculine animate subject is conjoined with a verb in a phlrM feminine tbrm (el. also the example above).
