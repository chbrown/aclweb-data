While much effort has been made to apply NLP techniques to IR, very few NLP techniques have been evaluated on a document collection larger than several megabytes. Many NLP techniques are simply not efficient enough, and not robust enough, to handle a large amount of text. This paper proposes a new probabilistic model for noun phrase parsing, and reports on the application of such a parsing technique to enhance document indexing. The effectiveness of using syntactic phrases provided by the parser to supplement single words for indexing is evaluated with a 250 megabytes document collection. The experiment's results show that supplementing single words with syntactic phrases for indexing consistently and significantly improves retrieval performance. 1 Introduction Information Retrieval (IR) is an increasingly important application area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). An IR task can be described as to find, from a given document collection, a subset of documents whose content is relevant to the information need of a user as expressed by a query. As the documents and query are often natural language texts, an IR task can usually be regarded as a special NLP task, where the document text and the query text need to be processed in order to judge the relevancy. A general strategy followed by most IR systems is to transform documents and the query into certain level of representation. A query representation can then be compared with a document representation to decide if the document is relevant to the query. In practice, the level of representation in an IR system is quite \"shallow\" -- often merely a set of word-like strings, or indexing terms. The process to extract indexing terms from each document in the collection is called indexing. A query is often subject to similax processing, and the relevancy is judged based on the matching of query terms and document terms. In most systems, weights are assigned to terms to indicate how well they can be used to discriminate relevant documents from irrelevant ones.","The challenge in applying NLP to IR is to deal with a large amount of unrestricted natural language text. The NLP techniques used must be very efficient and robust, since the amount of text in the databases accessed is typically measured in gigabytes. In the past, NLP techniques of different levels, including morphological, syntactic/semantic, and discourse processing, were exploited to enhance retrieval (Smeaton 92; Lewis and Spaxck Jones 96), but were rarely evaluated using collections of documents larger than several megabytes. Many NLP techniques are simply not efficient enough or are too labor-intensive to successfully handle a large size document set. However, there are some exceptions. Evans et al. used selective NLP techniques, that are especially robust and efficient, for indexing (Evans et al. 91). Strzalkowski reported a fast and robust parser called TTP in (Strzalkowski 92; Strzalkowski and Vauthey 92). These NLP techniques have been successfully used to process quite large collections, as shown in a series of TREC conference reports by the CLARIT TM1 system group and the New York University (later GE/NYU) group (cf., for example, (Evans and Lefferts 95; Evans et al. 96), and (Strzalkowski 95; Strzalkowski et al. 96)) These research efforts demonstrated the feasibility of using selective NLP to handle large collections. A special NLP track emphasizing the evaluation of NLP techniques for IR is currently held in the context of TREC (Hatman 96).","In this paper, a fast probabilistic noun phrase parser is described.

A 250-megabyte document set 2 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of indexing using the phrases extracted by the parser. The experiment's results show that using syntactic phrases to supplement single words for indexing improves the retrieval performance significantly. This is quite encouraging compared to earlier experiments on phrase indexing. The noun phrase parser provides the possibility of combining different kinds of phrases with single words.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses document indexing, and argues for the rationality of using syntactic phrases for indexing; Section 3 describes the fast noun phrase parser that we use to extract candidate phrases; Section 4 describes how we use a commercial IR system to per-form the desired experiments; Section 5 reports and discusses the experiment results; Section 6 summarizes the conclusions. 2 Phrases for Document Indexing In most current IR systems, documents are primarily indexed by single words, sometimes supplemented by phrases obtained with statistical approaches, such as frequency counting of adjacent word pairs. However, single words are often ambiguous and not specific enough for accurate discrimination of documents. For example, only using the word \"baalS' and \"terminology\" for indexing is not enough to distinguish \"bank terminology\" from \"terminology baalS'. More specific indexing units are needed. Syntactic phrases (i.e., phrases with certain syntactic relations) are al-most always more specific than single words and thus are intuitively attractive for indexing. For example, if \"bank terminology\" occurs in the document, then, we can use the phrase \"bank terminology\" as an ad-ditional unit to supplement the single words \"banld' and \"terminology\" for indexing. In this way, a query with \"terminology banlZ' will match better with the document than one with \"bank terminology\", since the indexing phrase \"bank terminology\" provides extra discrimination.","Despite the intuitive rationality of using phrases for indexing, syntactic phrases have been reported to show no significant improvement of retrieval performance (Lewis 91; Belkin and Croft 87; Fagan 87). Moreover Fagan (Fagan 87) found that syntactic phrases are not superior to simple statistical phrases. Lewis discussed why the syntactic phrase indexing has not worked and concluded that the problems with syntactic phrases are for the most part statistical (Lewis 91). Indeed, many (perhaps most) syntactic phrases have very low frequency and tend to be over-weighted by the normal weighting method. However, the size of the collection used in","2the Wall Street Journal database in Tipster Disk2 (Harman 96) these early experiments is relatively small. We want to see if a much larger size of collection will make a difference. It is possible that a larger document collection might increase the frequency of most phrases, and thus alleviate the problem of low frequency.","We only consider noun phrases and the subphrases derived from them. Specifically, we want to obtain the full modification structure of each noun phrase in the documents and query. From the viewpoint of NLP, the task is noun phrase parsing (i.e., the analysis of noun phrase structure). When the phrases are used only to supplement, not replace, the single words for indexing, some parsing errors may be tolerable. This means that the penalty for a parsing error may not be significant. The challenge, however, is to be able to parse gigabytes of text in practically feasible time and as accurately as possible. The previous work taking on this challenge includes (Evans et al. 91; Evans et al. 96; Evans and Zhal 96; Strzalkowski and Carballo 94; Strzalkowski et al. 95) among others. Evans et al. exploited the \"attestedness\" of subphrases to partially reveal the structure of long noun phrases (Evans et al. 91; Evans et al. 96). Strzalkowski et al. adopted a fast Tagged Text Parser (TTP) to extract head modifier pairs including those in a noun phrase (Strzalkowski 92; Strzalkowski and Vauthey 92; Strzalkowski and Carballo 94; Strzalkowski et al. 95). In (Strzalkowski et al. 95), the structure of a noun phrase is disambiguated based on certain statistical heuristics, but there seems to be no effort to assign a full structure to every noun phrase. Furthermore, manual effort is needed in constructing grammar rules. Thus, the approach in (Strzalkowski et M. 95) does not address the special need of scalability and robustness along with speed. Evans and Zhai explored a hybrid noun phrase analysis method and used a quite rich set of phrases for document indexing (Evans and Zhai 96). The indexing method was evaluated using the Associated Press newswire 89 (AP89) database in Tipster Diskl, and a general improvement of retrieval performance over the indexing with single words and full noun phrases was reported. However, the phrase extraction system as reported in (Evans and Zhal 96) is still not fast enough to deal with document collections measured by gigabytes. 3","We propose here a probabilistic model of noun phrase parsing. A fast statistical noun phrase parser has been developed based on the probabilistic model.

Since noun phrases with more than two words are structurally ambiguous, if we only observe the noun phrase, then the actual structure that generates the noun phrase is \"hidden\". We treat the noun phrases with their possible structures as the complete data and the noun phrases occurring in the corpus (without the structures) as the observed incomplete data. In the training phase, an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al. 77) can be used to estimate the parameters of word modification probabilities by iteratively maximizing the conditional expectation of the likelihood of the complete data given the observed incomplete data and a previous estimate of the parameters. In the parsing phase, a noun phrase is assigned the structure that has the maximum conditional probability given the noun phrase.","Formally, assume that each noun phrase is generated using a word modification structure.

In practice, this is not a very tight limit, since simple noun phrases with more than six words are quite rare. Summing over all the possible structures for any noun phrase is computed by enumerating all the possible structures with an equal length as the noun phrase.

In the experiments reported in this paper, an over-simplified solution is adopted. We simply fixed the modification structure parameter and assumed every dependency structure is equally likely.","Fast training is achieved by reading all the noun phrase instances into memory. 9 This forces us to split the whole noun phrase corpus into small chunks for training. In the experiments reported in this paper, we split the corpus into chunks of a size of around 4 megabytes. Each chunk has about 170,000 (or about 100,000 unique) raw multiple word noun phrases. The parameters estimated on each sub-corpus are then merged (averaged). We do not know how much the merging of parameters affects the parameter estimation, but it seems that a majority of phrases are correctly parsed with the merged parameter estimation, based on a rough check of the parsing results. With this approach, it takes a 133-MHz DEC Alpha workstation about 5 hours to train the parser over the noun phrases from a 250-megabyte","SFor the experiments reported in this paper, the threshold is 2.","9An alternative way would be to keep the corpus in the disk. In this way, it is not necessary to split the corpus, unless it is extremely large. 315 text corpus. Parsing is much faster, taking less than 1 hour to parse all noun phrases in the corpus of a 250-megabyte text. The parsing speed can be scaled up to gigabytes of text, even when the parser needs to be re-trained over the noun phrases in the whole corpus. However, the speed has not taken into account the time required for extracting the noun phrases for training. In the experiments described in the following section, the CLARIT noun phrase extractor is used to extract all the noun phrases from the 250-megabyte text corpus.","After the training on each chunk, the estimation of the parameter of word modifications is smoothed to account for the unseen word modification pairs. Smoothing is made by \"dropping\" a certain number of parameters that have the least probabilities, taking out the probabilities of the dropped parameters, and evenly distributing these probabilities among all the unseen word pairs as well as those pairs of the dropped parameters. It is unnecessary to keep the dropped parameters after smoothing, thus this method of smoothing helps reduce the memory over-load when merging parameters. In the experiments reported in the paper, nearly half of the total number of word pairs seen in the training chunk were dropped. Since, word pairs with the least probabilities generally occur quite rarely in the corpus and usually represent semantically illegal word combinations, dropping such word pairs does not affect the parsing output so significantly as it seems. In fact, it may not affect the parsing decisions for the majority of noun phrases in the corpus at all.","The potential parameter space for the probabilistic model can be extremely large, when the size of the training corpus is getting larger. One solution to this problem is to use a class-based model similar to the one proposed in (Brown et al. 92) or use parameters of conceptual association rather than word association, as discussed in (Lauer 94)(Lauer 95)."]},{"title":"4 Experiment Design","paragraphs":["We used the CLARIT commercial retrieval system as a retrieval engine to test the effectiveness of different indexing sets.

We performed the experiments by using the TREC-5 ad hoc topics (i.e., TREC topics 251-300). Each run involves an automatic feedback with the top 10 documents returned from the initial retrieval. The CLARIT automatic feedback is performed by adding terms from a query-specific thesaurus extracted from the top N documents returned from the initial retrieval(Evans and Lefferts 95). The results are evaluated using the standard measures of recall and precision. Recall measures how many of the relevant documents have actually been retrieved. Precision measures how many of the retrieved documents are indeed relevant.

We explored the application of a fast statistical noun phrase parser to enhance document indexing in information retrieval.

Experiment results on this 250-megabyte document collection have shown that using different kinds of syntactic phrases provided by the noun phrase parser to supplement single words for indexing can significantly improve the retrieval performance, which is more encouraging than many early experiments on syntactic phrase indexing.
