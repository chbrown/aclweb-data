It conducts a conversation with a student to help the student learn to solve a class of problems in cardiovascular physiology dealing with the regulation of blood pressure. It uses natural language for both input and output, and can handle a variety of syntactic constructions and lexical items, including sentence fragments and misspelled words. Using CIRCSIM-Tutor One of the important topics which beginning medical students must learn is how blood pressure is regulated in the human body. When something happens to change the blood pressure, such as a change in the volume of blood in the body, the body must compensate. The negative feedback loop which controls this process, known as the"]},{"title":"baroreeeptor reflex,","paragraphs":["can be a difficult topic for students.","CIaCSlM-Tutor is based on a qualitative model involving seven core physiological parameters. The core parameters and the causal relationships between them are shown in the concept map in Figure 1.

After the predictions are entered, the dialogue will unfold on the other side of the screen. Instructional and Discourse Planning The main components of CIRCSIM-Tutor v.2 are the input understander, the student modeler, the instructional planner, the discourse processor, the text generator, and the knowledge base/problem solver."]},{"title":"F F","paragraphs":["+ B","'","-[-","•","+"]},{"title":"q","paragraphs":["'+ Figure 1"]},{"title":"13","paragraphs":["CIRCS]M-Tutor picks a problem for the student to solve and obtains the correct answers from the problem solver. It collects the student's predictions and calls the instructional planner to conduct a conversation.","The planner is given the student's predictions, plus a student model showing student errors and possible misconceptions. CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 2 uses an overlay model. For each causal relation in the knowledge base, the student model keeps a record of whether the student is correct or mistaken about that relationship. This record is built when the predictions are first entered and updated during the dialogue.","The planning cycle is implemented with an augmented finite state machine. The tutoring plans are kept on a stack. State transitions are chosen based on the student's current input, whether the student has attempted the question before, and domain knowledge. For example, the system only generates a hint when the student makes a mistake on the first try at a question. Otherwise it gives the student the right answer.","The planner calls the discourse processor with a list of discourse actions such as the following: 1. Elicit the determinants of the erroneous variable 2. Elicit the currently active determinant 3. Elicit the relationship between the active deter-","minant and the erroneous variable 4. Elicit the correct value","Alternatives to elicit are to give a declarative explanation or a hint (\"Remember that ...\")."]},{"title":"Parsing, Interpretation and and Spelling Correction","paragraphs":["The input understanding component of CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 2 contains a bottom-up chart parser, producing first a phrase-structure parse and then a Lexical Functional Grammar f-structure. Matching the f-structure functional representation of the student's utterance to Problem: Pacemaker malfunctions DR RR SS Dialogue RAP CC SV HR CO TPR MAP the logic form of the tutor's question is largely performed by ad hoc code. This task is simplified by the fact that ten predicates cover most student answers.","The CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 2 input lexicon is comprised of approximately 750 lemmata. Also in the lexicon are basic Lexical-Functional Grammar annotations to be used by the parser. Spelling correction is an important aspect of the input understander, as students frequently misspell words, abbreviate creatively, and make word boundary errors (two words joined together or a single word split in two). Spelling correction is based on a three-way match algorithm which slides a small window simultaneously across both the unknown input word and a candidate word from the lexicon. Transpositions, elisions, substitutions, and similar errrors are counted and the most likely candidate is picked."]},{"title":"Text Generation","paragraphs":["The text generator produces sentences from logic forms generated by the planner. A single tutor turn may involve several logic forms, such as an acknowledgment, an explanation expressed as a declarative statement, and a question. The logic forms are used to fill in abstract templates. Transformations such as passivization, insertion of auxiliary verbs and whmovement are performed, and the final sentence is linearized with the help of an LFG grammar."]},{"title":"Example of Generated Dialogue","paragraphs":["Here is an excerpt from a conversation generated from the tutoring tutoring tactic illustrated above: T: Remember that the Direct Response occurs imme-","diately and produces changes in the system before","any reflex is activated.
