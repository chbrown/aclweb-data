In order to overcome this problem new technologies for future information management systems are explored by various researchers. One new line of such research is the investigation and development of information extraction (IE) systems. The goal of IE is to build systems that find and link relevant information from text data while ignoring extraneous and irrelevant information (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996).","Current IE systems are to be quite successfully in automatically processing large text collections with high speed and robustness (see (Sundheim, 1995), (Chinchor et al., 1993), and (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996)).

Applying regular expressions (the text scanner is implemented in lex, the well-known Unix tool), the text scanner identifies some text structure (e.g., paragraphs, indentations), word, number, date and time tokens (e.g, \"1.3.96\", \"12:00 h\"), and expands abbreviations. The output of the text scanner is a stream of tokens, where each word is simply represented as a string of alphabetic characters (including delimiters, e.g. \"Daimler-Benz\").

Morphological processing follows text scanning and performs inflection, and processing of compounds. The capability of efficiently processing compounds is crucial since compounding is a very productive process of the German language.","The morphological component called MONA is a descendant of MORPHIX, a fast classification-based morphology component for German (Finkler and Neumann, 1988). MONA improves MORPHIX in that the classification-based approach has been combined with the well-known two-level approach, originally developed by (Koskenniemi, 1983).

During traversal two-level rules are applied for recognizing linguistically well-formed decompositions of the word form in question.","The output of MONA is the word form together with all its readings. A reading is a triple of the form (stem, inflection,pos), where stem is a string or a list of strings (in the case of compounds), inflection is the inflectional information, and pos is the part of speech.","Currently, MONA is used for the German and Italian language. The German version has a very broad control flow. coverage (a lexicon of more then 120.000 stem entries), and an excellent speed (5000 words/sec without compound handling, 2800 words/sec with compound processing (where for each compound all lexically possible decompositions are computed). 2 Part-of-speech disambiguation Morphological ambiguous readings are disambiguated wrt. part-of-speech using case-sensitive rules 3 and filtering rules which have been determined using Brill's un-supervised tagger (Brill, 1995). The filtering rules are also used for tagging unknown words.","The filtering rules are determined on the basis of unannotated corpora. Starting from untagged corpora, MONA is used for initial tagging, where unknown words are ambiguously tagged as noun, verb, and adjective. Then, using contextual information from unambiguously analysed word forms, filter rules are determined which are of the form change tag of word form from noun or verb to noun if the previous word is a determiner.","First experiments using a training set of 100.000 words and a set of about 280 learned filter rules yields a tagging accuracy (including tagging of unknown words) of 91.4%. 4","Note that the un-supervised tagger required no hand-tagged corpora and considered unknown words. We expect to increase the accuracy by improving the un-supervised tagger through the use of more linguistic information determined by MONA especially for the case of unknowns words. 4 Fragment processing Word group recognition and extraction is performed through fragment extraction patterns which are expressed as finite state transducers (FST) and which are compiled to Lisp functions using a compiler based on (Krieger, 1987). An FST consists of a unique name, the recognition part, the output description, and a set of compiler parameters. The recognition part An FST operates on a stream of tokens. The recognition part of an FST is used for describing regular patterns over such token","2Measurement has been performed on a Sun 20 using an on-line lexicon of 120.000 entries.","3Generally, only nouns (and proper names) axe written in standard German with an capitalized initial letter (e.g., \"der Wagen\" the car vs. \"wit wagen\" we venture). Since typing errors are relatively rare in press releases (or similar documents) the application of case-sensitive rules are a reliable and straightforward tagging means for the German language.","4Brill reports a 96% accuracy using a training set of 350.000 words and 1729 rules. However, he does not handle unknown words. In (Aone and Hausman, 1996), an extended version of Brill's tagger is used for tagging Spanish texts, which includes unknown words. They report an accuracy of 92.1%."]},{"title":"211","paragraphs":["streams. For supporting modularity the different possible kind of tokens are handled via basic edges, where a basic edge can be viewed as a predicate for a specific class of tokens. More precisely a basic edge is a tuple of the form (name, test, variable), where name is the name of the edge, test is a predicate, and variable holds the current token Tc , if test applied on Tc holds. For example the following basic edge (:mona-cat \"partikel\" pre) tests whether Tc produced by MONA is a particle, and if so binds the token to the variable pre (more precisely, each variable of a basic edge denotes a stack, so that the current token is actually pushed onto the stack).","We assume that for each component of the system for which fragment extraction patterns are to be defined, a set of basic edges exists.

The two constraints are maintained by the basic edges :add-nec and :add-opt. :add-nec performs as follows. If the current token is a fragment of type :np or :name-np then inspect the set named nec and select the constraint set typed :np . If the current token agrees in case (which is tested by type subsumption) then push it to lcompl and reduce the upper bound by 1.

Here, SMES is applied on a quite different domain, namely news items concerning the German IFOR mission in former Yugoslavia. Our task is to identify those messages which are about violations of the peace treaty and to extract the information about location, aggressor, defender and victims.","The corpus consists of a set of monthly reports (Jan. 1996 to Aug. 1996) each consisting of about 25 messages from which 2 to 8 messages are about fighting actions. These messages have been hand-tagged with respect to the relevant information. Although we are still in the development phase we will briefly describe our experience of adapting SMES to this new domain. Starting from the assumption that the core machinery can be used un-changed we first measured the coverage of the existing linguistic knowledge sources. Concerning the above mentioned corpus the lexicon covers about 90%. However, from the 10% of unrecognized words about 70% are proper names (which we will handle without a lexicon) and 1.5% are spelling errors, so that the lexicon actually covers more then 95% of this unseen text corpus. The same \"blind\" test was also carried out for the date, time, and location subgrammar, i.e., they have been run on the new corpus without any adaption to the specific domain knowledge. For the date-/time expressions we obtained a recall of 77% and a precision of 88%, and for the location expressions we obtained 66% and 87%, respectively. In the latter case, most of the unrecognized expressions concern expressions like \"nach Taszar/Ungarn\", \"im serbischen bzw. kroatischen Teil Bosniens\", or \"in der Moslemisch-kroatischen FSderation\". For the general NP and PP subgrammars we obtained a recall of 55% and a precision of 60% (concerning correct head-modifier structure). The small recall is due to some lexical gap (including proper names) and unforeseen complex expressions like \"die Mehrzahl der auf 140.000 gesch~itzten moslemischen Fltichtlinge\". But note that these grammars have been written on the basis of different corpora.","In order to measure the coverage of the fragment combination patterns FCP, the relevant main verbs of the tagged corpora have been associated with the corresponding FCP (e.g., the FCP for transitive verbs), without changing the original definition of the FCPs. The only major change to be done concerned the extension of the output description function BUILD-ITEM for building up the new template structure. After a first trial run we obtained an unsatisfactory recognition rate of about 25%. One major problem we identified was the frequent use of passive constructions which the shallow parser was not able to process. Consequently, as a first actual extension of SMES to the new domain we extended the shallow parser to cope with passive constructions. Using this extension we obtained an recognition of about 40% after a new trial run.","After the analysis of the (partially) unrecognized messages (including the misclassified ones), we identified the following major bottlenecks of our current system. First, many of the partially recognized templates are part of coordinations (including enumerations), in which case several (local) templates share the same slot, however this slot is only mentioned one time. Resolving this kind of \"slot sharing\" requires processing of elliptic expressions of different kinds as well as the need of domain-specific inference rules which we have not yet foreseen as part of the core system. Second, the wrong recognition of messages is often due to the lack of semantic constraints which would be applied during shallow parsing in a similar way as the subcategorization constraints."]},{"title":"215","paragraphs":["Although these current results should and can be improved we are convinced that the idea of develop-ing a core IE-engine is a worthwhile venture."]},{"title":"8 Related work","paragraphs":["In Germany, IE based on innovative language technology is still a novelty.

The main features are: a very efficient and robust morphological component, a powerful tool for expressing finite state expressions, a flexible bidirectional shallow parser, as well as a flexible interface to an advanced formalism for typed feature formalisms. The system has been fully implemented in Common Lisp and C.","Future research will focus towards automatic adaption and acquisition methods, e.g., automatic extraction of subgrammars from a competence base and learning methods for domain-specific extraction patterns."]},{"title":"10 Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The research underlying this paper was supported by research grants from the German Bundesministerium fiir Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie (BMBF) to the DFKI projects PARADICE, FKZ ITW 9403 and PARADIME, FKZ ITW 9704.
