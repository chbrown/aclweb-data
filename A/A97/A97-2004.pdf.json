During the Training Process, the user, with the help of a graphical user interface, takes a few prototypical articles from the domain that the system is being trained on, and creates rules (patterns) for the target information contained in the training articles. These rules are specific to the training articles and they are generalized so that they can be run on other articles from the domain. The Rule Generalization routines, with the help of WordNet 1 (Miller, 1990), generalize the specific rules generated by the Training Process. The system can now be run on a large number of articles from the domain (Scanning Process). The output of the Scanning Process, for each article, is a semantic network for that article which can then be used by a Postprocessor to fill Supported by Fellowships from IBM Corporation. lWordNet is an on-line lexical reference system de-","veloped by George Miller at Princeton University. t....- ~.

It also determines sentence boundaries.","The preprocessor tries to identify some important entities like names of companies, proper names, etc. contained in the article. Groups of words that comprise these entities are collected together and con-7 sidered as one item for all future processing.","The Partial Parser produces a sequence of nonoverlapping phrases as output. The headword of each phrase is also identified. The parser recognizes noun groups, verb groups and preposition groups 2 (Hobbs, 1993). 2.3 The Training Interface There are two parts to the Training Process: identification of the (WordNet) sense usage of headwords of interest, and the building of specific rules. Training is done by a user with the help of a graphical user Training Interface."]},{"title":"3 Generalization","paragraphs":["Rules created as a result of the Training Process are very specific and can only be applied to exactly the same patterns as the ones present during the training. Generalization consists of replacing each concept in a rule by a more generalized concept (obtained from WordNet).

For rules from each training set, seven levels of generalization were performed. Based on the generalized rules at each level,","2We wish to thank Jerry Hobbs of SRI for providing us with the finite-state rules for the parser. u~ 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 40 30 20 10",", , ..........."]},{"title":":---::::-~! -. -_--.-i I I I I I","paragraphs":["1 2 3 4 5 degree of generalization Figure 3: Precision vs. Degree of Generalization 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 40 30 20 10","i i i i i 8 train-arts -- 16 train-arts ..... 24 train-arts ......
