Instead of attempting to handle all possible grammatical errors, the grammar checker identifies certain specific types of grammatical mistakes that appear more regularly than others in the present domain of application."]},{"title":"2 Grammatical Mistakes","paragraphs":["The current project started as part of a collaboration between the Computer and Information Science department and the English Language Programs at the University of Pennsylvania in an effort to provide a computational tool for students who are learning English as a second language. As an initial attempt, the present implementation focuses on certain dominant types of syntactic mistakes, as identified from the available set of students' essays.","The kind of mistakes that are detected by the current system includes: Wrong capitalization (sentence initial, wrong lowercase/uppercase initial letter), missing fragments (subjects, objects, some prepositions, complements, articles, clauses,"]},{"title":"the, than,","paragraphs":["ere), some extra elements (e.g., the infinitive marker after auxiliary verbs), wrong agreement (number, case, etc), wrong verb form, and various mismatches (verb tense with adverbs, etc). 3 Gralnlnar Formalism In order to handle ungrammatical expressions as well as grammaticM ones, we utilized the syntactic domain of locality implicit in categorial lexica l entries under the CCG framework, by including known variations of categorial association in the lexical entries. Multiple parts-of-speech are handled by putting all the assertions regarding grammatical parts-of-speech before those regarding ungrammatical ones."]},{"title":"4 Categorial Lexicon","paragraphs":["In constructing a categorial lexicon for the grammar, we used an existing grammar-independent lexicon that had been made available as part of the XTAG project at the University of Pennsylvania.
