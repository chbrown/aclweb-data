Cooperating agent systems have been developed to partially automate this task. In order to extend the circle of participants as far as possible we advocate the use of natural language transmitted by e-mail. We describe COSMA, a fully implemented German language server for existing appointment scheduling agent systems. COSMA can cope with multiple dialogues in parallel, and accounts for differences in dialogue behaviour between human and machine agents. NL coverage of the sub-language is achieved through both corpus-based grammar development and the use of message extraction techniques. 1 Motivation Appointment scheduling is a problem faced daily by many individuals and organizations, and typical-ly solved using communication in natural language (NL) by phone, fax or by mail. In general, cooperative interaction between several participants is required. Since appointments are often scheduled only after a sequence of point-to-point connections this will, at times, necessitate repeated rounds of communication until all participants agree to some date and place. This is a very time-consuming task that should be automated.","Systems available on the market allow for calendar and contact management. As (Busemann and Merget, 1995) point out in a market survey, all planning and scheduling activity remains with the user. Cooperative agent systems developed in the field of Distributed AI are designed to account for the scheduling tasks. Using distributed rather than centralized","*This work has been supported by a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (FKZ ITW-9402). calendar systems, they not only guarantee a maximum privacy of calendar information but also offer their services to members or employees in external organizations. Although agent systems allow users to automate their scheduling tasks to a considerable degree, the circle of participants remains restricted to users with compatible systems.","To overcome this drawback we have designed and implemented COSMA, a novel kind of NL dialogue systems that serves as a German language frontend system to scheduling agents. Human language makes agent services available to a much broader public. COSMA allows human and machine agents to participate in appointment scheduling dialogues via e-mall. We are concerned with meetings all participants should attend and the date of which is negotiable. 2 Design guidelines COSMA is organized as a client/server architecture. The server offers NL dialogue service to multiple client agent systems. Up to now, three different types of agent systems have been hooked up to the NL server. Agents developed in-house were used for the early system described in (Busemann et al., 1994). In a subsequent version, the MEKKA agents developed by Siemens AG (Lux et al., 1992) have been adapted. We present in Section 4 a third kind of client system, the PASHA II user agent.","Given the use of distributed calendar systems, techniques used by both human and machine agents for cooperatively scheduling appointments must be based on negotiation dialogues. However, human dialogue behaviour differs from interaction between machine agents considerably, as will be discussed in Section 4. A human-machine interface to existing appointment scheduling agent systems should comply to the following requirements:","• Human utterances must be analyzed to correspond closely to agent actions.","• Machine utterances must conform to human dialogue strategies."]},{"title":"25","paragraphs":["Artificial communication languages have been designed for human discourse, e.g. (Sidner, 1994), as well as for agent-agent interaction, e.g. (Steiner et al., 1995).

The server must analyze human-generated text and verbalize machine-initiated goals. For a plausible application, the server must be:","• complete with respect to a sublanguage: all relevant information related to appointments must be analyzed,","• sufficiently robust to deal with inconsistent analysis results.","Within the HPSG-based approach to grammar description adopted for the early system (Uszkoreit et al., 1994), achieving these goals turned out to be difficult. This \"deep\" approach to NLU describes NL expressions at general linguistic levels (syntax and surface semantics), and attempts to capture the complete meanings of all and only the grammatical sentences. However, an NL system in a realistic application should not fail on unexpected input. Moreover, the surface semantic representations derived by the grammar were too close to NL for an agent system to deal with.","With the present version of the NL server these problems are solved by adopting a \"shallow\" analysis approach, which extracts meanings from those portions of a text that are defined as interesting and represents them in an agent-oriented way. Instead of failing on unexpected input, shallow parsing methods always yield results, although they may not capture all of the meaning intended by the user. By just describing the verbalizations of relevant information, shallow parsing grammars are highly domain-specific and task-oriented. In"]},{"title":"COSMA,","paragraphs":["shallow analysis is divided up into an application of the message extraction component sines (discussed in Section 5) and a semantic analysis component IMAS (Section 6). The former extracts appointment-related information from users' input texts. It is based on finite-state automata that were defined with help of an annotated corpus of e-mail messages. The task of the latter is to derive a client-oriented semantic representation, including the communicative intention and the complete specification of time points needed, which is based on context and semantic inferences.","The robustness requirement is fulfilled by recognizing failures within the server during semantic analysis, and possibly within the client systems, and by clarification dialogues (cf. Section 6.1).","After an overview of generation in COSMA (Section 7) we discuss component interaction in Section 8. A novel type of object-oriented architecture is needed to treat multiple dialogues in parallel. Virtual partial system instances are maintained as long as a dialogue is going on. One such instance is shown in Figure 1. 3 A complete sample dialogue A complete sample dialogue taken from the system's present performance will serve as a reference throughout the paper. Every utterance is numbered and labeled; the labels indicate speakers. We assume a three-party e-mail negotiation between a human (H), who does not use a scheduling agent system, and two machine agents (A, B) that schedule appointments for their respective owners. In the server, human interactions with multiple machine partners are treated as different NL dialogues (in the present case between H and A, and H and B).

The four main modules include the basic TCP/IP connection to the server; a parser of semantic representations of the server's analysis results, which yields PASHA II structures; an instantiation mechanism for semantic generation templates; and a control regime that keeps track of the current dialogue. The control regime confirms results of the server, or it activates the server's backtrack mechanism if the semantic representation received does not fit within the current dialogue step, or it issues a request for repair if backtracking should not yield any further results.","Receiving and sending e-mail. The PASHA II interaction mechanism includes, besides communication via TCP/IP protocols, e-mail interaction. The agent may poll its owner's mailbox or have one of its own. Either the agent or its owner is referred to as actor in the agent's e-mail messages (see Section 7).","Dialogue behaviour. An agent has to generate and understand different dialogue actions represented by corresponding cooperation primitives such as proposing, accepting, rejecting, canceling or fixing a meeting (Steiner et ai., 1995).","Agent-agent interaction usually relies on an initiating agent being responsible for the success of a negotiation. The initiator's broadcast proposal is triggered by its owner, who determines partners, duration and an interval within which the appointment should be scheduled. The agent proposes the first slot in the interval that is available according to its calendar. In case of a rejection of one or more participants, the initiator would continue to propose new time slots to all partners until everyone agrees to a common date or there is no such slot within the interval. Note that in case of rejection (see (05)) PASHA II agents do not use counter-suggestions.","In human-human negotiation, efficiency is a major goal. Humans often follow the least effort principle (Dahlb/ick, 1992): the initiator broadcasts a proposal including a time interval within which the meeting should take place (e.g. (03)) and expects refinements or counter-proposals from the participants. As the example shows this may imply the use of underspecified temporal descriptions. This strategy requires less communication because a greater amount of information is exchanged in one dialogue step between the participants.","Handling underspecified temporal information by offering free time slots (see (04), (07), and (08)) is among the extensions of PASHA II at the local planning layer. Note that this strategy can be instantiated in different ways, as becomes clear from dealing with expression such as next week: Only a selection of free time slots can be provided here, which is explicitly marked using e.g. for instance. Moreover, we consider it indispensable to have agents understand and generate counter-proposais to avoid inefficient plain rejections like (05). 5 Covering the domain language 5.1 Corpus-based annotation In order to determine the coverage of the sub-language relevant for the application and to measure progress during system development, a corpus of 160 e-mails was selected as reference material from several hundred e-mails collected from the domain of appointment scheduling. The e-mails were manual-ly analyzed and annotated with major syntactic and semantic features as well as speechact information. A combination of two relational database systems was employed to ease the storage, maintenance, extension and retrieval of the NL data: (i) DITo (Nerbonne et al., 1993), a full text database where the e-mails can be accessed, (ii) tsdb (Oepen et al., 1995), an elaborated fact database which permits the extraction of specific linguistic constructions together with the associated linguistic annotations. 3 Annotation ] Example Prepositional Phrases: Wie wgre es [How about] ...

Grammar development is guided by a frequency-based priority scheme: The most important area - temporal expressions of various categories - followed by basic phenomena including different verbal subcategorizations, local and thematic PPs, and the verbal complex are successfully covered. 5.2 Message extraction with smes The message extraction system sines (Neumann et al., 1997) is a core engine for shallow processing with a highly modular architecture. Given an ASCII text, sines currently produces predicate argument structures containing shallow semantic analyses of PPs and NPs. The core of the system consists of:","• a tokenizer, which scans the input using a set of regular expressions to identify the fragment patterns (e.g. words, date expressions, etc.),","• a fast lexical and morphological processing of 1,5 million German word forms,","• a shallow parsing module based on a set of finite state transducers,","• a result combination and output presentation component. Based on the information delivered by the morphological analysis of the identified fragment patterns, the system performs a constituent analysis. In order to combine complements and adjuncts into predicate-argument structures, special automata for verbs are then activated over the sequence of constituents analyzed so far. Starting from the main verb 4, a bidirectional search is performed whose domain is restricted by special clause markers, sines output yields information about the utterance relevant for the subsequent semantic analysis. 5.3 Semi-automatic grammar development The concrete realization of the automata is based on the linguistic annotations of the e-mail fragments in the corpus. The annotations render a semiautomatic description of automata possible. For instance, verb classification directly leads to the lexical assignment of a corresponding automaton in sines. By deriving parts of the grammar directly from corpus annotations, maintenance and extension of the grammars are eased considerably.","On the other hand, corpus extension can be supported by sines analyses. Existing automata can be","4If no vcrb is found, a \"dummy\" entry triggers proccssing of verbless expressions, which occur frequently in c-mail communication. used to annotate new material with available linguistic information. Manual checking of the results reveals gaps in the coverage and leads to further refinement and extension of the automata by the grammar writer.","This way, grammar development can be achieved in subsequent feedback cycles between the annotated corpus and sines automata. The implementation of the annotation procedure based on the sines output format is underway. 6 Semantic interpretation Semantic representations produced by sines are mapped into a format suitable for the PASHA-II client by the IMAS component (Information extraction Module for Appointment Scheduling). IMAS is based on a domain-dependent view of semantic interpretation: information-gathering rules explore the input structure in order to collect all and only the relevant information; the resulting pieces of information are combined and enriched in a monotonic, non-compositional way, thereby obtaining an IL (Interface Level) expression, which can be interpreted by the agent systems. In spite of the noncompositionality of this process, the resulting expressions have a clear model-theoretic interpretation and could be used by any system accepting first order logic representations as input.","IL expressions have been designed with the goal of representing both a domain action that is easily mapped onto an agent system's cooperation primitive, and the associated temporal information, which should be fully specified due to contextual knowledge. Temporal information is partitioned into RANGE, APPOINTMENT and DURATION information. RANGE denotes the interval within which a certain appointment has to take place (e.g. in (03)). APPOINTMENT denotes the interval of the appointment proper (e.g. in (10)). Intervals in general are represented by their boundaries. DURATION, on the contrary, encodes the duration of the appointment expressed in minutes. The backbone of an IL expression is thus the following: COOP RANGE identifier LEFT-BOUND RIGHT-BOUND APPT DURATION digit HOUR digit MINUTE digit HOUR digit MINUTE digit","IMAS relies on three basic data structures. The sentence structure contains all the IL expressions obtained from the analysis of a single sentence. They are ranked according to their informativeness.","The text structure contains all the sentence structures obtained from the analysis of a whole message. Here ranking depends not only on informative-29 ness but also on \"dialogue expectation\": sentence structures are favoured that contain a domain action compatible with the IL expression previously stored in the discourse memory. As a result, the NL server will pass to the client the most informative IL expression of the most informative and contextually most relevant sentence of the analyzed text. 5","The discourse memory is structured as a sequence containing all information collected during the dialogue. Thus it contains both IL expressions committed by the client and semantic input structures from generation. The discourse memory is used by IMAS as a stack.-","The procedural core of IMAS is represented by the transformation of the input sines representation into a set of IL expressions. This process is organized into three steps:"]},{"title":"Linguistic extraction.","paragraphs":["The semantic representation of the input sines structure is explored by a set of rules in such a way that all information relevant for the appointment domain is captured.

Either they contain expressions which need to be delimited in order to be pragmatically plausible (underspecification, e.g. (09)), or they refer to intervals which are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence (temporal anaphora). The first class includes probably any NL time expression; even a simple expression such as (01) requires some extralinguistic knowledge to be understood in its proper contextual meaning (in (01) the \"working day\" interval of the respective day must be known). The reconstruction of underspecified temporal expressions is performed by a set of template filling functions which make use of parameters specified by the client system at the beginning of the dialogue.","Temporal anaphora include expressions such as on Monday, tomorrow, next month, whose interpretation depends on the discourse context. Solv-ing anaphoric and deictic relations involves a rather complex machinery which borrows many concepts from Discourse Representation Theory.

Besides trivial cases of temporal constraint resolution, such as guessing the endpoint of an appointment from its startpoint and its duration, our inference engine performs disambiguation of domain actions by comparing intervals referred to by different dialogue utterances. For instance, if an utterance u describing an interval I is ambiguous between a refinement and a modification and the previous utterance refers to an interval J including I, then u can be disambiguated safely as denoting a refinement. Analogous inferences are drawn by just checking the possible combinations of domain actions across the current dialogue (a rejection can hardly be followed by another cancellation, a fixing cannot occur after a rejection, etc.). The constraints guiding this disambiguation procedure are encoded as filters on the output of IMAS and reduce the set of pragmatically adequate IL expressions."]},{"title":"6.1 Handling of analysis failures","paragraphs":["Sometimes IMAS produces an output which cannot be used by the PASHA-II client. This happens when the human message is either too vague ( What about a meeting?), or contains an inconsistent temporal specification (as in (01)). In these cases IMAS stores the available information, and the server generates a request for clarification in order to recover the necessary temporal specifications or to fix the already available ones. This request is mailed to the human partner. It includes the list of misspelled words found in the input message, which may give the partner a clue for understanding the source of the error. Once a clarification is provided, the server attempts to build an IL expression by merging and/or replac-ing the information already available with the newly extracted one (cf. (03)). If the resulting IL expression satisfies the constraints on well-formedness, it is shipped to the PASHA-II client. Otherwise the clarification subdialogue goes on along the same lines. 7 Generation Client systems usually want to express in NL a cooperation primitive and a date expression. Hence NL generation is based on a semantic template filled by the client. Depending on its content the template is unified with a prefabricated structure specifying linguistic-oriented input to the generator. The same holds for failure messages, such as (02), and for specifications of free time slots, as in (07), where simple rules of aggregation take care not to repeat the full date specification for each clock time mentioned.","The production system TG/2 (Busemann, 1996) 30 proved to be sufficiently flexible to accomplish this task by its ability to generate preferred formulations first.

Due to the limited functionality of common architectural styles (Garlan and Shaw, 1993) with respect to these requirements, a novel object-oriented, manager-based and generic architecture has been designed and implemented. It combines techniques from different areas - in particular, from object technology (Booch, 1994) and from coordination theory including workflow management (Malone and Crowston, 1991) - and is based on two main concepts: the cooperating managers approach"]},{"title":"(COCONUTS)","paragraphs":["and the virtual system architecture model. 8.1 A manager-based approach Managers in the COCONUTS model are control units which coordinate or perform specific activities and cooperate with each other in a client/server form. Their responsabilities, properties, behaviour and interface are determined by the classes they belong to. The prominent COCONUTS managers are: the data manager, which provides services related to representation, printing, conversion and transmission of data; the report manager, which supports specification, generation and printing of processing reports; the global interface manager, which provides a generic server interface; the computing components managers (toMs), which encapsulates the system's components and let them appear as servers; and, finally, the workflow manager, which is the main control unit. 8.2 Coordination and control Coordinating internal system activities with respect to parallel dialogue processing (including backtracking and failure recovery facilities) requires very powerful and flexible mechanisms for task scheduling, synchronization and control. In COCONUTS this task is carried out by the workflow manager, which also manages interdependencies between these activities while avoiding redundant ones and controlling the flow of work among the involved managers (e.g., passing subtasks from one manager to another in a correct sequence, ensuring that all fulfill their required contributions and taking default actions when necessary). The behaviour and function of the workflow manager are determined by the following sequence of operations: identifying and formulating a workflow goal, decomposing it into subgoals, determining and allocating resources for achieving the subgoals, elaborating and, eventually, executing an operation plan. It also provides a range of special-ized exception handlers to ensure robustness (see Section 6.1). 8.3 A generic server interface Flexible and reliable client/server communication is made possible by the generic server interface module GSI.

This way, subsystems can, on demand, be used as servers, e.g. sines or the generator. 8.4 Integrating heterogenous components"]},{"title":"Each","paragraphs":["COSMA server component is encapsulated by a CCM (computing component manager), which makes its functionality available to other managers. A CCM has, among other things, a working (shortterm) memory, a long-term memory and a variety of buffers for storing and managing computed solutions for subsequent use. Using these features a CCM easily simulates incrementality and realizes intelligent backtracking by providing the computed solutions in a selective manner. A component can be released by a CCM it is bound to when the latter does no longer need its services; e.g. if the component has already computed all solutions. This permits efficient resource sharing, as several CCMS can be associated to one component. Thus, associating interface objects with CCMs provides a flexible way of realiz-ing distributed processing performed by components implemented in different languages and running on different machines. 8.5 The virtual system architecture The virtual system architecture allows for efficient parallel dialogue processing. It is based on the con-31 cept of cooperating object-oriented managers with the ability to define one-to-many relationships between components and ¢CMs. The key idea consists in adopting a manager-based/object-based view of the architecture shown in Figure 1. This architecture represents a virtual system (also called operation context), which is a highly complex object consisting of a variety of interacting managers. It may inherit from different classes of operation contexts, whose definitions are determined by the underlying domains of application. Thus, multiple dialogues are processed in parallel just by running each dialogue in a separate virtual system. As soon as a dialogue is completed, the assigned virtual system can be reused to process another one. Conceptually, no constraints are made on the number of active virtual systems in the server software. In order to ensure correct processing, a manager may operate in only one virtual system at a time. Note that managers can still be shared by virtual systems and they behaviour can vary from one system to another. 9 Conclusion We described COSMA, a NL server system for existing machine agents in the domain of appointment scheduling. The server is implemented in Common Lisp and C. The PASHA II agent is implemented in DFKI-Oz (Smolka, 1995).","Robust analysis of human e-mail messages is achieved through message extraction techniques, corpus-based grammar development, and client-oriented semantic processing and representation.
