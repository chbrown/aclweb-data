One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relat, ion between broad semantic classes and LCS meaniug components. Our acquisition program--LEXICALL--takes, as input, the result of previous work on verb classification and thematic grid tagging, and outputs LCS representations for different. languages. These representations have been ported into English, Arabic and Spanish lexicons, each containing approximately 9000 verbs. We are currently using these lexicons in an operational foreign language tutoring and machine translation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A wide range of new capabilities in NLP applications such as foreign language tutoring (FLT) has been made possible by recent advances in lexica.1 semantics (Carrier and Randall, 1993; Dowty, 1991; Fill-more, 1968; Foley and Van Valin, 1984; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Hale and Keyser, 1993; Jack-endoff, 1983; aackendoff, 1990: Jackendoff, 1996; Levin, 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav, To appear; Pesetsky, 1982; Pinker, 1989). Many of these researchers adopt the hypothesis that verbs can be grouped into broad classes, each of which corresponds to some combination of basic meaning con> ponents. This is the basic premise underlying our approach to multilingual lexicon construction. In particular, we have organized verbs into broad selnantic classes and subsequently designed a set of le,ical conceptual structures (LC, S), for each class. These representations have been ported into English, Arabic, and Spanish lexicons, each containing approximately 9000 verbs.","An example of a NLP application for which these lexicons are currently in use is an operational foreign language tutoring (FLT) system called Military Language Tutor (MILT). This system provides a wide range of lessons for use in language training. One of the tutoring lessons, the MicroWorld"]},{"title":"Lesson (see","paragraphs":["Figure 1) requires the capability of the language-learner to state domain-specific actions in a variety of different ways. For example, the language-learner might connnand the agent (pictured at the left in the graphical interface) to take the following action: Walt\" to the table and pick up the document. The same action should be taken if the user says: Go to the table and remove document, Retrieve the document from the table, etc. The LCS representation provides the capability to execute various forms of the same command without hardcoding them as part, of the graphical interface.","In another tutoring lesson, Question-Answering, the student is asked to answer questions about a foreign language text that they have read. Their answer is converted into an LCS which is matched against a prestored LCS corresponding to an answer typed in by a human instructor (henceforth, called the \"author\"). The prestored LCS is an idealized form of the answer to a question, which can take one of many forms. Suppose, for example, the question posed to the user is: Where did Jack put the book'? (or Addnde paso Jack el libro? in Spanish). The author's answer, e.g., Jack put the book in the trash, has been stored as an LCS by the tutoring system. If the student types Jack threw the book in the trash, or Jack moved the book from the table into the trash, the system is able to nautch against the prestored LCS and determine that all three of these responses are semantically appropriate.","We have developed an acquisition program-- LEXICALL--that allows us to construct LCS-based lexicons for the FLT system. This program is designed to be used for multiple languages, and also for other NLP applications (e.g., machine translation). One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relation between broad semantic classes (based on work by Levin (1993)) and LCS meaning components. We build on previous work, where verbs were classified automatically (Doff and .Jones, 1996:"]},{"title":"139","paragraphs":["Figure 1: MicroWorld Lesson in MILT","x~","#",",","~",".~ ~,a ~","~","~","~:':",":::",": Dorr, To appear) and tagged with thematic grid information (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995). We use these pre-assigned classes and thematic grids as input to LEXICALL. The output is a set of LCS's corresponding to individual verb entries in our lexicon.","Previous research in automatic acquisition focuses primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Wu and Xia, 1995) or extraction of syntactic constructions from online dictionaries and corpora (Brent, 1993). Others have taken a more knowledge-based (interlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mitamura, and Nyberg, 1995). Still others (Copestake et al.. 1995), use English-based grammatical codes for acquisition of lexical representations.","Our approach differs from these in that it exploits certain linguistic constraints that govern the relation between a word's surface behavior and its corresponding semantic class. We delnonstrate that-- by assigning a LCS representatioll to each semantic class--we can produce verb entries on a broad scale; these, in turn, are ported into multiple languages. We first show how the LCS is used in a FLT system. We then present an overview of the LCS acquisition process. Finally, we describe how LEXICALL constructs entries for specific lexical items."]},{"title":"2 Application of the LCS Representation to FLT","paragraphs":["One of the types of knowledge that must be captured in FLT is linguistic knowledge at the level of the lexicon, which covers a wide range of information types such as verbal subcategorization for events (e.g., that a transitive verb such as"]},{"title":"hit","paragraphs":["occurs with an object noun phrase), featural information (e.g., that the direct object of a verb such as"]},{"title":"frighlen","paragraphs":["is animate), thematic information (e.g., that"]},{"title":"Mary","paragraphs":["is the agent in"]},{"title":"Mary hie the ball),","paragraphs":["and lexical-semantic information (e.g., spatial verbs such as"]},{"title":"throw","paragraphs":["are conceptually distinct fi'om verbs of possession such as"]},{"title":"give).","paragraphs":["By modularizing the lexicon, we treat each information type separately, thus allowing us to vary the degree of dependence on each level so that we can address the question of how much knowledge is necessary for the success of the particular NLP application.","This section describes the use of the LCS representation in a question-answering component of the MILT system (Sains, 1993; Weinberg et al., 1995).

The thematic grid (_th_loc) indicates that the verb has two obligatory arguments, a theme and a location. 3 The !! in the LCS Template acts as a wildcard; it will be filled by a lexeme (i.e., a root form of the verb).

The dictionaries are based on a language-independent representation called lexical conceptual structure (LCS). Significant enhancements to LCS-based tutoring could be achieved by combining this representation with a mechanism for handling issues related to discourse and pragmatics. For example, Mthough the LCS processor is capable of determining that the phrase in the trash partially matches the answer to Where did John put the book?, a pragmatic component would be required to determine that this answer is (perhaps) more appropriate than the full answer, He put the book in the trash. Representing conversational context and dynamic context updating (Traum et al., 1996; Haller, 1996; DiEugenio and Webber, 1996) would provide a fl'ame-work for this type of response \"relaxation.\" Along","SWe have defined approximately 100 such mappings per language. For example, the mapping produces the following primitive representations for the English word to: (to loc (at loc)), (to poss (at poss)), (to temp (at temp)), (toward loc (at loc)), (toward poss (at poss)). We have similar mappings defined in Arabic and Spanish. For example, the following primitive representations are produced for the Spanish word a: (at loc), (to loc (at loc)), (to poss (at poss)), (toward loc (at lot))."]},{"title":"144","paragraphs":["these same lines, a pragmatic component could provide a mechanism for det, ermining that certain fully matched responses (e.g.,"]},{"title":"John hurled the book inlo the trash)","paragraphs":["are not. as \"realistic sounding\" as partially matched alternatives.","Initially, LEXICALL was designed to support the development of LCS's for English only; however, the same techniques can be used for nmltilingual acquisition. As the lexicon coverage for other languages expands, it, is expected that our acquisition techniques will help further in the cross-linguistic investigation of the relationship between Levin's verb classes and the basic meaning components in the LCS represent, ation. In addition, it is expected that verbs in the same Levin class may have finer distinctions than what we have specified in the current LCS templates.","We view the importation of LCS's from the English LCS database into Arabic and Spanish as a first, approxin~ation to the development of complete lexicons for these languages. The results have been hand-checked by native speakers using the class/grid/lexeme format (which is much easier to check than the flfily expanded LCS's). The lexical verification process took only two weeks by the native speakers. We estimate that, it would take at least 6 months to build such a lexicon from scratch (by human recall and data. entry alone), and in such a case, the potential for error would be a.t least twice as high.","One important benefit of using the Levin classification as the basis of our program is that, once the mapping between verb classes and LCS representations has been established, we can acquire the LCS representation for a new verb (i.e., one not in Levin) simply by associating it. with one of the 191 classes. We see our approach as a first step toward compression of lexical entries in that it allows lexicons to be stored in terms of the more condensed class/grid/lexeme specifications; these can expanded online, as needed, during sentence processing in the NLP application.","We conclude that, while human intervention is necessary for the acquisition of class/grid information, this intervention is virtually eliminated fi'om the LCS construction process because of our provision of a lnapping between semantic classes and primitive meaning components.
