This paper proposes a method for correcting Chinese repetition repairs and demonstrates the effects of repair processing in Chinese homophone disambiguation. The experimental results show that the precision rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90•65% can be achieved for the repair processing. At the same time, 50% of errors in the repairing segments can be reduced for Chinese homophone disambiguation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Repair is a very common phenomenon in spoken languages. Speakers usually repeat, add, replace, or even abandon some constructions in the utterances for some mental reasons. Typical repairs in Chinese spoken data' are shown in (1) and (2).","(i) • ..~2 ~ ~ t~ ~%-- I drink wine too SHI .. sometimes SHI","...(1.3)~__ ;̂~-- not too ..~F~ ~$fJ ~.\\ not too constrain-oneself particle (I am sometimes addicted to drinking.) The transcription system proposed by Bois, et al. (1992) is used to transcribe the spoken data.

(2) because eye","• .1~1~ -- N.\\ eye once close (Because eye .. Once (you) close your eyes .... )","Heeman and Allen (1994) describe that 25% of turns contain at least one speech repair in their corpus. In our study, 17% of turns contain at least one speech repair• Thus, the repair processing cannot be negligible and has influences to a certain extent.","Recently, text-first approach and speech-first approach have been proposed to touch on repairs in English. The text-first approach assumes the speech recognizer could provide a correct transcription. That is, it tries to detect and correct speech repairs automatically using text alone• Hindle (1983) adds rules to a deterministic parser to tackle the problem of correcting speech repairs. His parsing strategy depends on the successful disambiguation of the syntactic categories. Although syntactic categories can be determined well by local context, Hindle admits that speech repair disrupts the local context. Bear, et al. (1992) firstly try to parse the input sentence and then invoke a repair processing when the parsing fails• For repair processing, a simple pattern matcher finds the candidates based on the lexical cues at the first stage. Then the syntactic and semantic processing filters out the impossible candidates. Heeman and Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and corrects modification and abridged repairs. The algorithm uses some repair patterns to capture potential repairs. These patterns are built based on the identification of word fragments, editing terms 2, and word correspondences between the repaired segment 2 The editing terms can either be filled pauses (e.g., urn, un, er) or cue phrases (e.g., I mean, 1 guess, well). 57 and the repairing segment 3. The resulting potential repairs are then passed to a statistical filter that judges the proposal as either fluent speech or an actual repair.","The speech-first approach tries to identify speech repairs using acoustic and prosodic cues. Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993a; 1993b) investigate the detection of the interruption point of speech repairs based on this line. The cues that they found are the occurrence of a filled pause, the presence of a word fragment, the energy peaks in each word and other features such as accent. However, they do not address the problem of correcting speech repairs. In other words, they do not determine which words are undesired.","These approaches cannot be adopted to deal with Chinese speech repairs for the following reasons. First, a Chinese sentence is composed of a string of characters without any word boundaries. In other words, it is necessary to segment Chinese sentence before tagging and parsing (Chen and Liu, 1992; Sproat, et al., 1994; Chen and Lee, 1996). Repairs make segmentation and text-first approach more difficult. Second, Chinese repairs may not always have an editing terms between a repaired segment and a repairing segment. In other words, editing terms do not have much effect in Chinese repair processing. Third, duplicate constructions (e.g.,"]},{"title":"~'~['I~","paragraphs":["(bangl bangl mang2, help), ]i~:~]i~:,~ (yan2 jiu4 yah2 jiu4, study)) generated by repeating words or phrases in Chinese utterances are used very often, but they do not always initiate a repair. That is, a simple pattern matching mechanism cannot be workable. Forth, the Chinese speech repairs may be initiated at various syntactic environment (Chui, 1995), e.g., before the subject, during the subject, after the subject and before the verb, during the verb, during a direct object, during a prepositional phrase, during subordination, and so on. The variety makes the identification of Chinese speech repairs more troublesome.","Because the repairs introduce much noise in language processing, we cannot defer the task of repair processing to the latter stages. This paper employs acoustic and prosodic information to correct Chinese repetition repairs. The results are applied to Chinese homophone disambiguation. Section 2 defines four major types of speech repairs. Section 3 introduces the spoken corpus. Sections 4 and 5 describe the 3 A repair is composed of a repaired segment and a repairing segment which immediately follows the repaired segment. A repaired segment denotes the portion of the utterance which is being repaired, and a repairing segment denotes the portion which is accomplishing the repair (Fox and Jasperson, forthcoming). That is. the repaired segment is replaced by the repairing segment. baseline and the advanced models for repetition repairs, respectively. Section 6 demonstrates the effects of repair processing in Chinese homophone disambiguation. Section 7 concludes the remarks."]},{"title":"2 Types of Chinese Speech Repairs","paragraphs":["Heeman and Allen (1994) divide English speech repairs into three types: fresh start, modification repair and abridged repair.
