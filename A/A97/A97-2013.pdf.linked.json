The system contains demonstrated advancements in part-of-speech tagging, end-of-sentence detection, and coreference resolution. In addition, we believe that we have strong maximal noun phrase detection, and subject-verb-object recognition and a pattern matching language well suited to a range of tasks. Other features of the system include modularity and interchangeability of components, rapid component integration and a debugging environment. The demo will feature aspects of the system currently being used to develop a coreference resolution engine in preparation for MUC-7, in addition to an information extraction task done over the summer of 1996. Two aspects of the system will be featured prominently, a diagnostic tool for evaluating system output using SRA's discourse tagging tool (DTT) and the MOP pattern matching language. The diagnostic tool takes a coreference annotated text to be evaluated, an answer key assumed to be correct, and produces various diagnostics which evaluate system performance. Areas of evaluation include: • Classification of coreference links into correct, sins of commission(precision errors), sins of omission (recall errors) • Noun phrase detection errors • Filters on what sorts of links to evaluate • Support of system trace functions in the DTT • Fast implementation of MUC-6 scoring algorithm In addition, we present MOP (Mother of Perl), a pattern description language developed for use in an information extraction task and currently being used to do coreference. Patterns are described in MOP by left-to-right enumeration of components, with each component specifing at various levels of descriptive granularity. The patterns are compiled into Perl scripts, which perform back-tracking search on the input text. MOP also allows for rapid integration of a variety of analytical modules, such as part-of-speech taggers and parsers."]},{"title":"23","paragraphs":[]}],"references":[],"cites":[]}
