During patient-centered activities, utterances generated by a computer system intrude on patient management.

Utterances that would not make a clinically significant difference to patient management must be avoided.

Initial definitive management scopes a complex range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Resolving often conflicting demands for managing multiple injuries requires global reasoning that can exceed the restricted locality of rule-based systems. The modular architecture of the current system, TraumAID 2.0, consists of two complementary processes: (1) a rule-based reasoner able to draw diagnostic conclusions and identify what goals each of them implies; and (2) a planner that takes the set of currently relevant goals and constructs a management plan - a partially-ordered sequence of actions - that is most appropriate at that point in time.","TraumAID 2.0 has been retrospectively validated against actual trauma management plans for 97 nonpregnant adult patients presenting consecutively to the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP) Trauma Center with penetrating injuries to the chest and/or abdomen. A blinded comparison of management plans was carried out by a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons. They preferred TraumAID 2.0% plans to actual management to a statistically significant extent (Clarke et al., 1993).","A decision support system will not be clinically viable without solving its interface problems. For us, this means (1) getting TraumAID the information it needs for its reasoning and planning, and (2) getting the results of TraumAID's reasoning to the members of the trauma team (in particular, to the chief surgical resident) during the course of care.","To get information into TraumAID, we have developed an electronic version of a standard trauma flow sheet, so that information can be entered by the scribe nurse during the trauma resuscitation. 2 The electronic trauma flow sheet is implemented in HyperCard, supported by a FoxPro database. Relevant information entered by the scribe nurse is automatically passed to TraumAID 2.0.","The focus of this paper is the problem of delivering the results of TraumAID's deliberations, given an early pilot study that showed that physicians using TraumAID disliked the continuous presentation of its entire management plan. (Currently, this is displayed on the nurse's monitor in a separate window.) The reasons for physician dissatisfaction appear to be that (1) much of the time, TraumAID's recom-","2One member of the trauma team is a nurse who func-tions as a scribe, documenting all the findings, tests, and treatments in chronological order for the record. The multiple page trauma flow sheet has designated areas for specific information, such as demographics, mechanism of injury, physician response times, trauma score, Glasgow coma score, vital signs, location of wounds, results of primary assessment, intravenous therapy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, medications given, fluid in-take and output, and disposition. mendation coincided with the physicians' own plans, and (2) having the entire plan presented made it difficult for the physicians to determine what, if any-thing, they should focus on. To put it another way, presenting the entire plan violates Grice's Maxim of Relevance.","We decided to explore how TraumAID could restrict commentary to only those situations in which a comment would be clinically relevant in terms of its potential for making a clinically significant difference to patient management. We took advantage of the fact that actions that involve resources that need to be brought to the trauma bay or that can only be done elsewhere must be ordered. Since orders can be rescinded, comments pointing out problems with an order can potentially make a clinically significant difference to patient management. Our prototype interface for TraumAID produces commentary when an order differs significantly from what TraumAID would recommend. It also generates commentary when the physician fails to order something that TraumAID thinks should be done within the immediate time frame. The interface, TraumaTIQ (Gertnet, 1994; Gertner, 1994b), uses plan inference and plan evaluation to recognize both such errors of commission and errors of omission. In this paper, we de-scribe TraumAID's knowledge of management goals and actions that are used in plan inference and evaluation (Section 2), the plan recognition and evaluation strategies that allow TraumaTIQ to recognize clinically significant differences in patient management(Section 3), and the additional problems for plan recognition, plan evaluation and critique generation caused by a planner's ability to optimize plans through what Pollack has called \"overloading intentions\" (Pollack, 1991) (Section 4). We conclude with mention of our planned prospective evaluations of TraumAID and TraumaTIQ and a summary of our main points (Section 5). 2 The Representational Framework In TraumAID, a plan is a set of procedures, each of which comprises one or more actions. Procedures are used to address diagnostic and therapeutic management goals motivated by what is currently known about the patient. A particular action can participate in more than one procedure, and thus can be used in addressing more than one goal. As noted earlier, TraumAID uses a rule-based reasoner to derive a set of relevant goals from the currently available knowledge about the patient and a planner to choose appropriate procedures to address those goals and schedules the actions they involve.","TraumAID's reasoner controls information acquisition using a conservative, staged strategy for diagnosis and treatment (Rymon, 1993): expensive, definitive tests are not included in a plan until they are justified by less costly tests or observations, and 126 G1 (32 G1 G2 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A1 A2 A3 Shared Action Shared Procedure Figure h Three possible multiple GI"]},{"title":"q","paragraphs":["A1 A2 A3 G2 A4 A5 A6"]},{"title":"Independent","paragraphs":["goal-procedure-action configurations goals procedures actions definitive treatment is not recommended without the results of sufficient evidence from diagnostic tests. 3 These strategies are reflected in the knowledge base by the occurrence of related management goals, such as a goal to diagnose hematuria (blood in the urine), which if present, triggers a goal to diagnose bladder injury, which in turn can lead to a goal to treat bladder injury. Goals that do not participate together in a coherent strategy may still be connected by test results. For example, the goal of finding a bullet in the mediastinum leads to doing a lateral chest x-ray. While this might also reveal a fractured sternum, there is no strategic relationship between the goal of finding a bullet in the mediastinum and the goal of treating a fractured sternum.","Once a set of relevant goals has been determined, the planner's choice of how address each goal is based on both local and global considerations.

Less preferred procedures may be selected if they would result in a globally more optimal (less costly) plan. Figure 1 shows three possible configurations for a portion of a plan addressing two goals. (Section 4 discusses the consequences for plan recognition, evaluation and critiquing, of the ability to create plans in which actions and/or procedures are shared between goals.)","Actions are scheduled according to both logistical and clinical considerations. Logistical considerations mean that patients are only moved in one direction through the Trauma Center - from the emergency center, optionally to the radiology suite, then optionally to the operating suite, and finally to the","3The one case where this is not true is when a patient comes in near death, with catastrophic chest wounds.

TraumaTIQ interprets and evaluates these intentions, and generates a comment if it would be relevant to do so. TraumaTIQ also interprets the lack of an ordered action within an appropriate time frame as indicating the physician's lack of intention to perform that action and evaluates it as such. This approach is a form of critiquing, early examples of which are (Langlotz and Shortliffe, 1983; Miller, 1986).","TraumaTIQ's critiquing process is triggered whenever new information is entered by the scribe nurse and delivered to TraumAID. This information can be in the form of (1) bedside findings, (2) diagnostic test results (indicating both that a diagnostic action has been performed and what the results of that action were), (3) therapeutic actions performed, or (4) diagnostic or therapeutic actions ordered by the physician. TraumaTIQ interprets the physician's orders in a goal-directed manner, using TraumAID's representation of goals, procedures and actions, so that the critique can address the likely reasons underlying any discrepancies and can suggest alternative means of addressing a particular goal.

Like other members of the trauma team, TraumaTIQ must infer the plan incrementally based on what is known about the patient and what has been ordered so far.","Trauma management poses particular problems for plan recognition. First, there is no fully pre-set sequence in which actions are ordered and done. Secondly, multiple diagnostic and therapeutic goals may simultaneously be active, and a single action can often be used to address several related or un-related goals. In this domain, it would thus be incorrect to simplify search by minimizing the number of top-level goals in the inferred plan, as Kautz and others have proposed (Kautz, 1990). Third, a plan recognition strategy cannot assume that the physician's plan is correct: management of trauma patients must often be done late at night and under time pressure, conditions that can lead to less than optimal decision-making even in trained professionals. Since the number of possible incorrect plans is too large to encode"]},{"title":"a priori,","paragraphs":["we must make certain","assumptions about physicians' plans:","• The head of a trauma team will have expert or near-expert knowledge of trauma, and will usually develop plans that are similar to TraumAID's. Thus, if an action has been ordered that is also in TraumAID's plan, TraumaTIQ assumes that it is being done for the same reason(s). We call this giving the physician the \"benefit of the doubt.\"","• The physician is more likely to have appropriate goals but be addressing them in a sub-optimal way, than to be pursuing the wrong goals altogether.","• While TraumAID follows a conservative strategy for pursuing diagnosis and treatment from observations, physicians may proceed more rapidly, pursuing a goal that may be involved in a current strategy but for which TraumAID does not yet have enough evidence to conclude its relevance. An understanding of the strategic relationships between goals should help to recognize examples of this difference.","Reflecting these assumptions, the plan recognition algorithm works as follows:","1. When an action, a, is ordered by the physician, check whether ~ is currently a part of TraumAID's recommended plan as a means of satisfy-ing all or part of goal 7, or all or part of each member of a set of goals F. 2.

Section 2).","(c) If no relevant goal or strategy is found, leave the goal unspecified and add the intention to do a to the representation of the physician's plan with no goal attached. There is one exception to this rule:","(d) If the system only knows of one possible goal that would lead to performing c~, TraumaTIQ assumes that a is being done to address that goal, even though it does not consider the goal to be relevant. 3.2 Plan Evaluation After attempting to infer the goal(s) underlying the physician's actions, TraumaTIQ attempts to identify whether commentary is warranted on any aspects of his plan. Plan evaluation begins by comparing the plan attributed to the physician with the plan produced by TraumAID, looking for four types of discrepancies: 128"]},{"title":"TraumAtD 2.0 ]","paragraphs":["(~. patient \"~ (f actions .~_..~ ~lan~ I Generation [ ~ .... ~/ Figure 2: The TraumaTIQ module","• Omission: A goal that TraumAID considers relevant is not being addressed by the physician in a timely manner.

If a unique goal can be inferred to explain this discrepancy, that goal can be further categorized as to whether (1) it is unwarranted, (2) it is not fully proven, or (3) it has already been addressed.","• Procedure choice: A relevant goal is being addressed, but not using the procedure preferred by TraumAID.","• Scheduling: Actions are not being done in the order recommended by Traumaid, e.g., satisfy-ing urgent goals before non-urgent ones.","TraumaTIQ upholds the Maxim of Relevance by attempting to avoid comments that may later prove irrelevant. Errors of omission are not critiqued until a sufficient period of time has elapsed during which the physician might order the action. The amount of time allowed depends on the urgency of the goal that the action is intended to address - the rule of thumb TraumaTIQ uses is that a comment should be produced after approximately 10% of the time period has passed that is available to address the goal without significant consequences. Furthermore, comments are only made with respect to goals that cannot be made irrelevant by actions scheduled to be done before those goals are addressed.","Discrepancies of all types are then evaluated in terms of their potential clinical significance. Currently this is only a rough estimate based on approximate cost and whether or not a procedure is invasive. For example, an unnecessary chest x-ray is considered insignificant while an unnecessary (and invasive) laparotomy is considered clinically significant and worth drawing to the physician's attention. We are currently in the process of developing more objective criteria for classifying errors according to their potential impact on the outcome of the case. Each discrepancy will be classified as either: (1) tolerable, probably harmless, (2) non-critical, but potentially harmful, or (3) critical, potentially fatal. Anything in the second or third category will be considered significant enough to be reported in the critique, while tolerable errors will not be mentioned.","The output of plan evaluation is a set of communicative goals containing (1) a propositional content (PC) indicating the type of discrepancy and the particular TraumAID concepts involved, and (2) an illocutionary force (IF), such as URGE, INFOrtM or aEMIND, indicating how the information should be realized linguistically. For example, the goal:"]},{"title":"(SUGGEST","paragraphs":["(PROCEDURE-CHOICE GET-X-RAY-LAT-ABD GET-CT-SCAN-ABD 129 P~O-CoMPOUND-FRACTURE-LUMBAR-"]},{"title":"VERTESRA))","paragraphs":["would be produced in a situation in which the physician has ordered a CT-scan of the abdomen, which TraumaTIQ has inferred is intended to address the goal of diagnosing a compound fracture of the lumbar vertebra, which TraumAID has instead chosen to address with a considerably less costly, less time-consuming lateral abdominal X-ray. The illocutionary force of SUGGEST indicates that this is a noncritical error. Had it been evaluated as a critical error, the illocutionary force would have been URGE. 3.3 Critique Generation Critique generation serves to organize TraumaTIQ's communicative goals according to the management goals they address and to translate them into Natural Language utterances. This is currently the least sophisticated part of the process: each IF-PC pair indexes a sentential template with syntactically marked slots to be filled in with the appropriate phrasal translation of a TraumAID concept. For example, the template indexed by (SUGGEST, PROCE-DURE CHOICE) is: \"TraumAID suggests (ARG1 GERUN-DIVE) rather than (ARG2 GERUN-DIVE). The former is preferred for (ARG3 GERUNDIVE).\" The first and second slots are filled in with gerundive phrases corresponding to GET-X-RAY-LAW-ABD and GET-CT-SCAN-ABD, while the third slot is filled in with an untensed verb phrase corresponding to R,O-COMPOUND-FRACTURE-LUMBAR-VERTEBRA, resulting in the sentence: \"TraumAID suggests getting a lateral X-Ray of the abdomen rather than getting a CT-sean of the abdomen.

In other words, if an action ordered by the physician can be used to address two or more relevant goals, it is assumed that that is what the physician intends. This assumption makes sense because as long as both goals are being addressed, there is no need to produce a critique, even if the physician did not have both goals in mind.","If, on the other hand, there is a possibility for overloading that the physician does not exploit, it may be clinically relevant to mention it. For example, consider a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, loss of sensation in both legs, and hematuria (Figure 3a).
