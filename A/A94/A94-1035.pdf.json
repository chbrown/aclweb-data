In natural language processing, therefore, the study of adverbs has not developed very far to date.","Linguists have examined adverb grammatical functions and meanings in detail(Quirk et al., 1985) (Greenbaum, 1969). Our method is based on these studies about adverb grammatical functions and meanings. Other adverb studies by linguists include studies which handle the meanings of specific adverbs, such as \"even \", \"s~ill\" and \"already \" and temporal adverb studies which handle temporal semantics in sentences.","The main problems in adverb processing in Japanese to English machine translation(Ogura et al., 1993) are as follows: 1. the multiplicity of adverb meanings 2. differences in expression between Japanese and En-","glish for adverbial meaning 3. word ordering of English adverbs in English gener-","ation 4. representation of adverbs in a computer","In this paper, we focus our attention on the 3rd problem."]},{"title":"2 Classification of English Adverbs","paragraphs":["2.1 Position In our adverb position system for English adverb generation, 5 positions are provided. The first is initial position (IP), the beginning of the sentence. The second is medial position (MP), between the subject and predicate, or if auxiliary verbs are in-volved in the sentence just after the first auxiliary","1In this paper, adverbs include idiomatic adverbial phrase, such as \"on purpose\". verb. The third is end position (EP), after a predicate. Pre position (PreP) and post position (PostP) are provided for adverbs as modifiers. A pre position adverb comes before a modificant and a post position adverb comes after a modificant. 2.2 Classification Adverbs can roughly be divided into subjuncts, adjuncts, disjuncts and conjuncts by their grammatical function. We classify adverbs by specifying differences in meaning and preferred positions within sentences for each adverb. The classification is shown in Figure 1.","Subjuncts Viewpoint, Courtesy, Subject-orientation Item General","Volitional MP & EP Focusing Restrictive PreP & PostP, Additive PreP & PostP & EP & IP & MP, Emphasizers Prep & EP, Amplifiers PreP & PostP & EP, Downtoners PreP & EP,","Adjuncts Manner, Means, Instrument, Position, Direction, Time-position MP & EP, Span MP & EP, Time-frequency Definite, Indefinite MP & EP","Disjuncts Style, Content Value Judgment Non-subject,","Subject,","Degree of truth Conjuncts IP & EP Post Position Numeral Modifiers Figure 1: Adverb Classification"]},{"title":"3 Word Ordering Method for English Adverbs","paragraphs":["Adverbs usually have many meanings, especially adverbs which are used frequently in our daily life.

The sentences are translated by a human translator. We manually examined whether English adverbs in the translation would be generated correctly using the proposed method. The results of experiment 1 are shown in Figure 3. 4.2 Experiment 2 The second experiment had the Japanese to English machine translation system ALT-J/E translate Japanese sentences to test various English adverb functions. The goal was to confirm that this adverb ordering method could handle various types of English adverbs.","The experiment considered 200 arbitrary sentences which ALT-J/E was known to analyze correctly. This method was compared to a previous version of ALT-J/E which did not use adverbs' grammatical functions and meanings but only this preferred adverb positions. The result is as follows.","Table 1: Results of Experiment 2 Method Accuracy rate This Method 98% Previous Method 86% COS --- Correctly ordered sentences Improved Sentences: 27 (13.5%) Sentences changed for the worse: 3 (1.5%) COS 196 172 5 Conclusion A new adverb classification based on adverb grammatical functions, meanings and adverb preferred positions for English adverb generation in machine translation was proposed. The effectiveness of the English adverb ordering method in Japanese to English machine translation based on the adverb classification and the priority of the same adverb preferred positions is shown. The priority was decided by examining sentences with adverbs to generate English adverbs in Japanese to English machine translation. If correct English adverbs are selected after Japanese analysis and Japanese to English transfer, about 97% of adverbs can be put correct positions in sentences by this adverb ordering method. Compared with the previous adverb ordering method, the accuracy rate of the proposed method is improved 12%. The proposed method can also be used for adverbial prepositional phrases.","Examined Objects Japanese adverb entries: 362 words sentences: 1,906 sentences English adverbs translated from Japanese adverbs: 1,053","Accuracy rate 97.3%","Adverbs generated in incorrect positions 28(2.7%) absolutely incorrect position: 12 (1.1%) strange position: 16 (1.5%)","Figure 3: Results of Experiment 1","This experiment confirmed that the proposed word ordering method can handle large amount of adverbs correctly. 191 References S.
