These strengths concern the reuse of knowledge, the support for early drafts in several languages, the support for maintaining consistency when making changes, the support for producing alternative formulations, and the potential for producing higher quality outputs than machine translation. (The weaknesses concern the high-cost of building large, language-independent knowledge bases, and the dilficulty of producing high-quality. broad-coverage generation algorithms.)","From an economic perspective, the more a system can rely on language independent modules for the purpose of multilingual generatiom the better. If an MGEN system needs to develop language dependent knowledge bases, and language dependent algorithms for content selection, text planning, and sentence planning, it-is difficult to justify its economic viability. However, if most of these components are language independent and/or much of the code can be re-used, an MGEN system becomes a viable option.",".Many of the earl3 implementations of MGEN systems have adopted the perspective that text plan-ners can be implemented as language-independent modules (lordanskaja el, ;11., 1992: Goldberg et el., 1994), possibly followed by a hm:aricatwn stage, in which discourse l.rees are re-written to refleet~ language-specific constraints (R6sner and Stede. 1992; St,ede, 1999).

For example, Delin et al. (1994) noticed that sentences (1), (2), and (3), which were taken from a trilingual instruction manual for a step-aerobics machine, yield non-isomorphic Rhetorical Structure (Mann and Thompson, 1988) analyses in English, French, and German respectively (see Figure 1).

Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text spans. (There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as the CONTRAST relation that holds between unit [3] and span [4,.5] in the structure of the English text are multinuclear.) The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's intention than the satellite: and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa.

For these levels, it is difficult to explain the differences in terms of language-specific syntactic constraints. Rather, it seems more adequate to assume that there are significant differences with respect to the way information is organized rhetorically across languages. The experiment described in the next section estimates quantitatively this difference. 3 Experiment In order to assess how similar discourse structures are across languages, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding translations.

(Span [1,6] subsumes 2 sentences, so it is not sub-sentential.) The Japanese discourse tree has only 4 spans that could be matched in the same positions with English spans, namely spans [1,2]. [4,4], [5,5], and [1,5]. Hence the similarity between the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect to their discourse structure below the sentence level has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/ll (in Figure 2, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans).","In computing"]},{"title":"Position-Independent","paragraphs":["(P-I) recall and precision figures, even when a Japanese span \"floated\" during the translation to a position in the English tree that was different from the position in the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision figures are affected less than when computing Position-Dependent figures.

For instance, for the spans at the sub-sentential level in the trees in Figure 2 the position-independent recall is 6/10 and the position-independent precision is 6/11 because in addition to spans [1,2], [4,4], [5,5], and [1,5], one can also match Japanese spat, [1,1] to English spa,, [2,2] and Japanese spa,, [2,2] to Japanese span [1,1].

The results in Section 3 strongly suggest that if one is to build text plans in the context of a Japanese-English multilingual generation system, a language-independent text planning module whose output is mapped straightforwardly into sentence plans (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Goldberg et al., 1994) will not do. The differences between the rhetorical structures of Japanese and English texts are simply too big to support the derivation of a unique text plan, which would subsume both the Japanese- and English-specific realizations. If we are to build MGEN systems capable of generating rich texts in languages as distant as English and Japanese, we would need to use more sophisticated techniques. In the rest of this section, we discuss a set of possible approaches, which are consistent with work that has been carried out to date in the NLG field.","4.1 Use text plan representations that are more abstract than discourse trees Delin et al. (1994) have shown that although tile rhetorical renderings in Figure 1 are non-isomorphic. dmy are alt subsumed by one .commol~, more.abstract t.ext.-plan representation language that for-realizes the procedural relations of Generation and Enablement (Goldman, 1970). One caa~ conceive of. text plans being represented as sequences of actions or hierarchies of actions and goals over which one can identify Generation and Enablement relations that hold between them. In such a framework, text planning is carried out ill a language-independent manner. which is then followed by a rhetorical \"'fleshing out\". (Delin et al. (1994) have shown how Generation and Enablenlent relations are realized rhetorically in various languages using relations such as PURPOSE, 'SEQUENCE, CONDITION, and MEANS.)","Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) suggest that the variability present in Delin et al.'s Rhetorical Struc-21 ture analyses in Figure 1 can be explained by the inadequate mixture of intentional and semantic relations, at different levels of granularity. They propose that discourse phenomena should be accounted for at a more abstract level than RST relations and they present a classification system in terms","discourse-tree rewriting module capable of rewriting","P-specific discourse structures into O-specific dis-","course structures. When generating texts in lan-","guage P, the MGEN system works as a monolin-","gum generator.

Unfortunately, the research of Delin et al. (1994) and Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) cannot be applied yet to unrestricted domains. Generation and Enablement are only two of the abstract relations that can hold between actions and goals. And some texts, such as descriptions, are difficult to characterize only in terms of actions and goals. Building a \"complete\" taxonomy of such abstract relations and identifying adequate mappings between there relations and rhetorical relations are still open problems. 4.2 Derive a language-independent","discourse structure, and then linearize","it RSsner and Stede (1992) and Stede (1999) assume that a discourse representation g la Mann and Thompson imposes no contraints on the linear order of the leaves. For tile purpose of multilingual text planning, one can, hence, assume that a language-independent text planner derives first a language-independent rhetorical structure and then linearizes it, i.e., transforms it to make it language specific. The transformations that RSsner and Stede have applied concern primarily re-orderings of the children of some nodes and re-assignment of rhetorical relation labels. But given, for example, tile significant differences between the discourse structures in Figure 2, it is difficult to envision what the language-independent text plan might look like. It is deftnitely possible to conceive of such a text plan representation. However, the linearization module will need then to be much more sophisticated: it will need to be able to rewrite full structures, re-order constituents, aggregate_across possibly non-adjacent units, etc. 4.3 hnplement a text planning algorithm","for one language only. For all other","languages, devise discourse-tree","rewriting modules In this approach, the system developer assigns a preferrential status to one of the languages that are to be handled I) 3 ' the MGEN system. Lot's call this language P. The system developer implenlents text planning algorithms only for this language. For any other language O, the developer itnplements a 22 further with the sentence planning and realization stages. Marcu et al. (2000) present and evaluate a discourse-tree rewriting algorithm that exploits machine learning methods in order to map Japanese discourse trees into discourse trees that resemble English-specific renderings.","The advantage of such an approach is that the tree-rewriting modules can be also used in the context of machine translation systems in order to repackage and re-organize the input text rhetorically, to reflect constraints specific to the target language. The disadvantage is that, from an NLG perspective, there is no guarantee that such a system could produce better results than a system that implements language-dependent text planning modules. 4.4 Derive language-dependent text plans Another viable approach is to acknowledge that text plans vary significantly across languages and, therefore, should be derived by language-dependent planners. To this end, one could use both topdown (How, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993) and bottom-up (Marcu, t997; Mellish et al., 1998) text planning algorithms. The advantage of this approach is that it has the potential of producing trees that reflect tile peculiarities specific to any language. The disadvantage is that only the text planning algorithms are general: the plan operators and the rhetorical relations they operate with are language-dependent, and hence, more expensive to develop and maintain. 4.5 Discussion Depending oil tile languages and text genres it operates with, all MGEN system may get away with a language-independent text planner. However, for sophisticated genres and distant languages, implementing a language-independent planner that is straightforwardly'mapped i:nto sentence, plans does not appear to be a felicitous solution. We enumerated four possible alternatives for addressing the text planning problem in an MGEN system. Each of tile approaches has its own pluses and minuses. Which will eventually win in large-scale deployable MGEN systems remains an open question. References","John A. Bateman and Klaas Jan Flondliuis. 1997.
