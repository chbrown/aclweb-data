In this paper, instead of modifying some existing technique, or else proposing an entirely new approach, we decided to build a shallow parser using an off-the-shelf part-of-speech (POS) tagger. We deliberately did not modify the POS tagger's internal operation in any way. Our results suggested that achieving reasonable shallow-parsing performance does not in general require anything more elaborate than a simple POS tagger. However, an error analysis suggested the existence of a small set of constructs that are not so easily characterised by finite-state approaches such as ours. 2 The"]},{"title":"Tagger","paragraphs":["We used Ratnaparkhi's maximum entropybased POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

It consisted of the current tag tl, the next tag t2, the current chunk label cl, the last two letters of the next chunk label c2, the first two letters of the current word wl and the last four letters of the current word wl. This configuration was the result of numerous experiments and gave the best overall performance. The results can be found in Table 1. We remark upon our experiments in the comments section. 5 Error Analysis We examined the performance of our final model with respect to the testing material and found that errors made by our shallow parser could be grouped into three categories: difficult syntactic constructs, mistakes made in the training or testing material by the annotators, and errors peculiar to our approach. 2","Taking each category of the three in turn, problematic constructs included: co-ordination, punctuation, treating ditransitive VPs as being transitive VPs, confusions regarding adjective or adverbial phrases, and copulars seen as being possessives.","2The raw results can be found at: http://www.cog sci.ed.ac.uk/-osborne/conll00-results.txt The mis-analysed sentences can be found at: http://www.cogsci.ed. ac.uk/-osborne/conll00-results.txt. 146","Mistakes (noise) in the training and testing material were mainly POS tagging errors. An additional source of errors were odd annotation decisions.","The final source of errors were peculiar to our system. Exponential distributions (as used by our tagger) assign a non-zero probability to all possible events. This means that the tagger will at times assign chunk labels that are illegal, for example assigning a word the label I-NP when the word is not in a NP. Although these errors were infrequent, eliminating them would require 'opening-up' the tagger and rejecting illegal hypothesised chunk labels from consideration. 6 Comments As was argued in the introduction, increasing the size of the context produces better results, and such performance is bounded by issues such as sparse statistics. Our experiments suggest that this was indeed true.","We make no claims about the generality of our modelling. Clearly it is specific to the tagger used.","In more detail, we found that: • PPs seem easy to identify.","• ADJP and ADVP chunks were hard to identify correctly. We suspect that im-provements here require greater syntactic information than just base-phrases.","• Our performance at NPs should be improved-upon. In terms of modelling, we did not treat any chunk differently from any other chunk. We also did not treat any words differently from any other words.","• The performance using just words and just POS tags were roughly equivalent. However, the performance using both sources was better than when using either source of information in isolation. The reason for this is that words and POS tags have different properties, and that together, the specificity of words can overcome the coarseness of tags, whilst the abundance of tags can deal with the sparseness of words.","Our results were not wildly worse than those reported by Buchholz et al (Sabine Buchholz and Daelemans, 1999).

Im-provements might come from better modelling, dealing with illegal chunk sequences, allowing multiple chunks with confidence intervals, system combination etc, but we feel that such im-provements will be small. Given this, we believe that base-phrasal chunking is close to being a solved problem.
