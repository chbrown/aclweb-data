This paper advances the state of the art of designing an interlingua by showing how aspectual distinctions (telic versus atelic) can be derived from verb classifications primarily influenced by considerations of argument structure, and how these aspectual distinctions can be used to fill lexical gaps in the source language that cannot be left unspecified in the target language. Machine translation between any two languages often requires the generation of information that is implicit in the source language. In translating from Chinese to English, tense and other temporal information must be inferred from other grammatical and lexical cues.

This is unlike English, which much more rigidly distinguishes past from present tense through use of suffixes. Thus, in order to generate an appropriate English sentence from its Chinese counterpart, we need to fill in a potentially unexpressed tense.","Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sentences may contain implicit relations between clauses (temporal or otherwise) that must be made explicit in English. These multiple-clause sentences are often most naturally translated into English including an overt expression of their relation, e.g., the \"and\" linking the two clauses in (1), or as multiple sentences, as in (2)).","(1) 1 9 65 ~ ~ , ~ ,~ 1965 year before , our_country altogether only have 30 ten_thousand ton de"]},{"title":"~t ~2 , ~ ~ ~8","paragraphs":["shipbuilding capacity , year output is 8 ten_thousand ton Before 1965 China had a total of only 300,000 tons of shipbuilding capacity and the annual output was 80,000 ~ons."]},{"title":"(2)~ 8~ ~ ~ ~d Y","paragraphs":["this 8 ten_thousand ton actually include asp 517 cl , ship de tonnage is very low"]},{"title":"de","paragraphs":["This 80,000 tons actually included 517 ships.

The resulting Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) (3ackendoff, 1983), is a language-neutral representation of the situation (event or state), suitable for use as an interlingua, e.g., for machine translation. The LCS represents predicate argument structure abstracted away from language-specific properties of semantics and syntax. The 34 primitives of the interlingua provide for monotonic composition that captures both conceptual and syntactic generalities (Dorr et al., 1993) among languages. 1 The strength of the representation derives from the cross-linguistic regularities in the lexical semantics encoded in the LCS. The syntactic hierarchy (subject, object, oblique) is mirrored in the LCS hierarchy: for example THEMES are arguments of the LCS predicate, and AGENTS are arguments of the theme-predicate composition. Syntactic divergences (whether the object precedes or follows the verb, for example) are represented in language specific linearization rules; lexical divergences (whether the location argument is encoded directly in the verb, e.g. the English verb"]},{"title":"pocket","paragraphs":["or must be saturated by an exterfial argument) are stated in terms of the pieces of LCS struct-ure in the lexicon. SententiM representations derive from saturating the arguments required by the predicates in the sentence.","LCS rePresentations also include temporal information, where available in the source language: recent revisions include, for example (Dorr and Olsen, 1997a) standardizing LCS representations for the aspectual (un)boundedness ((A)TELICITY) of events, either lexically or sententially represented. Although at present the LCS encodes no supra-sentential discourse relations, we show how the lexical aspect information may be used to generate discourse coherence in temporal structure. Relations between clauses as constrained by temporal reference has been examined in an LCS framework by Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr and Gaasterland, 1995). They explore how temporal connectives are constrained in interpretation, based on the tense of the clauses they connect. While overt temporal connectives are helpful when they appear, our corpus contains many sentences with neither tense markers nor tense connectives. We must therefore look to a new source of information. We rely on the lexical information of the verbs within a sentence to generate both tense and temporal connectives.","Straightforward LCS analysis of many of the multi-clause sentences in our corpus leads to violations of the wellformedness conditions, which prevent structures with events or states directly modifying other events or states. LCS, as previously conceived, prohibits an event or state from standing in a modifier relationship to another event or state, without mediation of a path or position (i.e., as lexically realized by a preposition). This restriction reflects the insight that (at least in English) when events and states modify each other, the modification is either implicit, with the relevant events and states in separate sentences (and hence separate LCSs), as in the","1 LCS representations in our system have been created for Korean, Spanish and Arabic, as well as for English and Chinese. first sentence below, or explicit in a single sentence, as in the second sentence below. Implicit event-state modification (sentence 3) is prohibited.","* Wade bought a car. He needed a way to get to work.","* Wade bought a car because he needed a way to get to work.","* * Wade bought a car he needed a way to get to work.","It is exactly these third type that are permitted in standard Chinese and robustly attested in our data. If the LCS is to be truly an interlingua, we must extend the representation to allow these kinds of sentences to be processed. One possibility is to posit an implicit position connecting the situations described by the multiple clauses. In the source language analysis phase, this would amount to positing a disjunction of all possible position relations implicitly realizable in this language. Another option is to relax the wellformedness constraints to allow an event to directly modify another event. This not only fails to recognize the regularities we see in English (and other language) LCS structures, for Chinese it merely pushes the problem back one step, as the set of implicitly realizable relations may vary from language to language and may result in some ungrammatical or misleading translations. The second option can be augmented, however, by factoring out of the interlingua (and into the generation code) language-specific principles for generating connectives using information in the LCS-structure, proper. For the present, this is the approach we take, using lexical aspectual information, as read from the LCS structure, to generate appropriate temporal relations.","Therefore not only tense, but inter-sentential discourse relations must be considered when generating English from Chinese, even at the sentence level. We report on a project to generate both temporal and discourse relations using the LCS representation. In particular, we focus on the encoding of the lexical aspect feature TELICITY and its complement ATELIG-ITY to generate past and present tense, and corresponding temporal relations for modifying clauses within sentences. While we cannot at present directly capture discourse relations, we can garner aspectual class from LCS verb classification, which in turn can be used to predict the appropriate tense for translations of Chinese verbs into English."]},{"title":"2 Use of Aspect to Provide Temporal Information","paragraphs":["We begin with a discussion of aspectual features of sentences, and how this information can be used to provide information about the time of the situations"]},{"title":"35","paragraphs":["presented in a sentence. Such information can be used to help provide clues as to both tense and relationships (and cue words) between connected situations. Aspectual features can be divided into grammatical aspect, which is indicated by lexical or morphological markers in a sentence, and lexical aspect, which is inherent in the meanings of words. 2.1 Grammatical aspect Grammatical aspect provides a viewpoint on situation (event or state) structure (Smith, 1997). Since imperfective aspect, such as the English PROGRES-SIVE construction be VERB-ing, views a situation from within, it is often associated with present or contemporaneous time reference. On the other hand, perfective aspect, such as the English have VERB-ed, Views a situation as a whole; it is therefore often associated with past time reference ((Comrie, 1976; Olsen, 1997; Smith, 1997) cf. (Chu, 1998)). The temporal relations are tendencies, rather than an absolute correlation: although the perfective is found more frequently in past tenses (Comrie, 1976), both imperfective and perfective cooccur in some language with past, present, and fu-ture tense.","In some cases, an English verb will specify tense and/or aspect for a complement. For example, continue requires either an infinitive (3)a or progressive complement (3)b (and subject drop), while other verbs like say do not place such restrictions (3)c,d.","(3) a.

He said the asia-pacific region already is be-coming a focal point region 2.2 Lexical aspect While grammatical aspect and overt temporal cues are clearly helpful in translation, there are many cases in our corpus in which such cues are not present. These are the hard cases, where we must infer tense or grammatical aspectual marking in the target language from a source that looks like it provides no overt cues. We will show however, that Chinese does provide implicit cues through its lexical aspect classes. First, we review what lexical aspect is.","Lexical aspect refers to the type of situation de-noted by the verb, alone or combined with other sentential constituents. Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on three aspectual features: telicity, dynamicity and durativity. We focus on telicity, also known as BOUNDEDNESS. Verbs that are telic have an inherent end: winning, for example, ends with the finish line. Verbs that are atelic do not name their end: running could end with a distance run a mile or an endpoint run to the store, for example. Olsen (Olsen, 1997) proposed that aspectual interpretation be derived through monotonic composition of marked privative features [÷/0 dynamic], [.4-/0 durative] and [-t-/0 telic], as shown in Table 1 (Olsen, 1997, pp. 32-33).","With privative features, other sentential constituents can add to features provided by the verb but not remove them. On this analysis, the [.-I-durative, +dynamic] features of run propagate to the sentence level in run ~o the store; the [÷telic] feature is added by the NP or PP, yielding an accomplishment interpretation. The feature specification of this ¢ompositionally derived accomplishment is therefore identical to that of a sentence containing a telic accomplishment verb, such as destroy.","According to many researchers, knowledge of lexical aspect--how verbs denote situations as developing or holding in time-=may be used to interpret event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988). In particular, Dowty suggests that, absent other cues, a relic event is interpreted as completed before the next event or state, as with ran into lhe room in 4a; in contrast, atelic situations, such as run, was hungry in 4b and 4% are interpreted as contemporaneous with the following situations: fell and made a pizza, respectively."]},{"title":"(4)","paragraphs":["a. Mary ran into the room. She turned on her walkman. b. Mary ran. She turned on her walkman. c. Mary was hungry. She made a pizza.","Smith similarly suggests that in English all past events are interpreted as telic (Smith, 1997) (but cf. (Olsen, 1997)).","Also, these tendencies are heuristic, and not absolute, as shown by the examples in (5). While we get the expected prediction that the jumping occurs after the explosion in (5)(a), we get the reverse prediction in (5)(b). Other factors such as consequences of described situations, discourse context, and stereotypical causal relationships also play a role. (5) a. The building exploded. Mary jumped.","b.

The LCS framework consists of primitives (GO, BE, STAY, etc.), types (Event, State, Path, etc.) and fields (Loc(ational), Temp(oral), Foss(essional), Ident(ificational), Perc(eptual), etc.).","We adopt a refinement of the LCS representation, incorporating meaning components from the linguistically motivated notion of !ezical semantic template (LST), based on lexical aspect classes, as defined in the work of Levin and Rappaport Hovav (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995; Rappaport lttovav and Levin, 1995). Verbs that appear in multiple aspectual frames appear in multiple pairings between constants (representing the idiosyncratic meaning of the verb) and structures (the aspectual class). Since the aspectual templates may be realized in a variety of ways, other aspects of the structural meaning contribute to differentiating the verbs from each other. Our current database contains some 400 classes, based on an initial representation of the 213 classes in (Levin, 1993). Our current working lexicon includes about 10,000 English verbs and 18,000 Chinese verbs spread out into these classes.","Telic verbs (and sentences) contain certain types of Paths, or a constant, represented by ! !, filled by the verb constant, in the right most leaf-node argument.

Following the principles in (Dorr, 1993), lexical information and constraints on well-formed LCSes are used to compose an LCS for a complete sentence from a sentence parse in a source language. This composed LCS (CLCS) is then used as the starting points for generation into the target language, using lexical information and constraints for the target language.","The generation component consists of the following subcomponents:","Decomposition and lexlcal selection First, primitive LCSes for words in the target language are matched against CLCSes, and tree structures of covering words are selected. Ambiguity in the input and analysis represented in the CLCS is maintained (insofar as it is possible to realize particular readings using the target language lexicon), and new ambiguities are introduced when there are different ways of realizing a CLCS in the target language.","AMR Construction This tree structure is then translated into a representation using the Augmented Meaning Representation (AMR) syntax • of instances and hierarchical relations (Langkfide and Knight, 1998a); however the relations include information present in the CLCS and LCSes for target language words, including theta roles, LCS type, and associated features.","Realization The AMR structure is then linearized, as described in (Dorr et al., 1998), and morphological realization is performed. The result is a lattice of possible realizations, representing both the preserved ambiguity from previous processing phases and multiple ways of lineariz-ing the sentence.","Extraction The final stage uses a statistical bigram extractor to pick an approximation of the most fluentrealization (Langkilde and Knight, 1998b).","While there are several possible ways to address the tense and discourse connective issues mentioned above, such as modifying the LCS primitive elements and/or the composition of the LCS from the source language, we instead have been experimenting for the moment with solutions implemented within the generation component. The only extensions to the LCS language have been loosening of the constraint against direct modification of states and events by other states and events (thus allowing composed LCSes to be formed from Chinese with these structures, but creating a challenge for fluent generation into English), and a few added features to cover some of the discourse markers that are present. We are able to calculate telicity of a CLCS, using the algorithm in Figure 1 and encode this information as a binary teli¢ feature in the Augmented Meaning Representation (AMR).","The realization algorithm has been augmented with the rules in (6)","(6) a.

Evaluation is still tricky, since, in many cases, the interlingua analysis is incorrect or ambiguous in ways that affect the appropriateness of the generated translation. 8.1 Tense As mentioned above, evaluation can be very difficult in a number of cases. Concerning tense, our \"gold standard\" is the set of human translations,","generated tense","past present","human past 134 17","translation present 17 27 Table 2: Preliminary Tense Results previously constructed for these sentences. In many cases, there is nothing overt in the sentence which would specify tense, so a mismatch might not actually be \"wrong\". Also, there are a number of sentences which were not directly applicable for comparison, such as when the human translator chose a different syntactic structure or a complex tense. The newspaper articles were divided into 80 sentences. Since some of these sentences were conjunctions, this yielded 99 tensed main verbs. These verbs either appeared in simple present, past, present or past perfect('has or had verb-t-ed), present or past imperfective (is verb-l-lag , was verb--I--lag) and their corresponding passive (is being kicked, was being kicked, have been kicked) forms. For cases like the present perfect ('has kicked), we noted the intended meaning ( e.g past activity) expressed by the verb as well as the verb's actual present perfective form. We scored the form as correct if the system translated a present perfective with past tense meaning as a simple past or present perfective. There were 10 instances where a verb in the human translation had no corresponding verb in the machine translation, either due to incorrect omission or correct substitution of the corresponding nominalization. We excluded these forms from consideration. If the system fails to supply a verb for independent reasons, our system clearly can't mark it with tense. The results of our evaluation are summarized in Table 2.","These results definitely improve over our previous heuristic, which was to always use past tense (assuming this to be the default mode for newspaper article reporting). Results are also better than always picking present tense. These results seem to indicate that atelicity is a fairly good cue for present tense. We also note that 8 out of the 14 cases where the human translation used the present tense while the system used past tense are headlines. Headlines are written using the historical present in English (\"Man bites Dog\"). These sentences would not be incorrectly translated in the past (\"The Man Bit the Dog\") Therefore, a fairer judgement might leave only remaining 6 incorrect cases in this cell. Using atelicity as a cue for the present yields correct results approximately 65incorrect results 35worst case results because they do not take into account presence or absence of the grammatical perfective and progressive markers referred to in the introduction."]},{"title":"39","paragraphs":["8.2 Relationship between clauses Results are more preliminary for the clausal connectives. Of the 80 sentences, 35 of them are flagged as (possibly) containing events or states directly modifying other events or states. However, of this number, some actually do have lexical connectives represented as featural rather than structural elements in the LCS, and can be straightforwardly realized using translated English connectives such as since, after, and if.then. Other apparently \"modifying\" events or states should be treated as a complement relationship (at least according to the preferred reading in ambiguous cases), but are incorrectly analyzed as being in a non-complement relationship, or have other structural problems rendering the interlingua representation and English output not directly related to the original clause structure.","Of the remaining clear cases, six while relationships were generated according to our heuristics, in-dicating cotemporaneousness of main and modifying situation, e.g. (7)a,b, in the automated translations of (1) and (2), respectively. None were inappropriate. Of the cases where then was generated, indicat-ing sequential events, there were four cases in which this was appropriate, and three cases in which the situations really should have been cotemporaneous.

Furthermore, the lexical aspect represented in the LCS can help to provide the beginnings of cross-sentential discourse information. We have suggested applications in the temporal domain while, then. Causality is another possible domain in which relevant pieces encoded in sentence-level LCS structures could be used to provide links between LCSes/sentences.
