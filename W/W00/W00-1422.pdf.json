Our approach uses an attribute grammar to propagate missing information where needed in a tree that represents the text to be realized. This declaratively-specified grammar mediates be-tween application-produced output and the input to a generation system and, as a consequence, can easily augment an existing generation system. Endapplications that use this approach can produce high quality text without a fine-grained specification of the text to be realized, thereby reducing the burden to the application. Additionally, representations used by the generator are compact, because values that can be constructed from the constraints encoded by the grammar will be propagated where necessary. This approach is more flexible than defaulting or making a statistically good choice because it can deal with long-distance dependencies (such as gaps and reflexive pronouns). Our approach differs from other approaches that use attribute grammars in that we use the grammar to enrich the representations of the content to be realized, rather than to generate the text itself. We illustrate the approach with examples from our template-based text-realizer, YAG. 1 Introduction Typically, a text realization system requires a great deal of syntactic information from an application in order to generate a high quality text; however, an application might not have this information (unless it has been built with text generation in mind).

Attributes in their system assist the realization by propagating information down a tree that specifies the complete syntactic structure of the output text. By contrast, our work employs attribute grammars, not to realize a text, but to perform a generation gap analysis prior to actual realization. We use both inherited and synthesized attributes (i.e., propagating information both down and up a tree) to share information and to determine appropriate values for any missing features. 2 An Overview of YAG YAG (Yet Another Generator) (Channarukul, 1999; McRoy et al., 1999) is a template-based text-realization system that generates text in real-time. YAG uses templates to express text. structures corresponding to fragments of the target language. Templates in YAG are declarative and modular. Colnplex texts can be generated 173\" embedding templates inside other tenlplates.","Values for the tenlplates are provided by an application; inputs can include either,a conceptual representation of content or a feature structure. When an input is only partially specified, defaults defined in a template will be applied. Figure I shows an example of YAG's feature-structure based input; YAG would realize this example as \"Jack and I want his sister's dog to swim. \". This input is partially specified, and thus is more compact and easier for an application to specify, than a complete specification. Figure 2 shows the features that have been omitted and the defaults used t75 YAG to realize the sentence from tile input.","Although the input is already more compact than a full specification, further simplification of the input provided from an application would have been possible, if certain inferences could be made. For example, Figure 3 shows an input structure that could replace the one given in Figure 1. In Figure 3, it was not necessary for the application to specify that the conjunction of two noun phrases is a phlral noun phrase, nor that component noun phrases (proper nouns, pronouns, and possessives) should not, contain an article. In the case of conjunctions, there is no default that would provide the correct outputs in all cases, because the same conjunction template is used to conjoin adjectives and clauses. Instead, our approach uses an attribute grammar to make the appropriate inferences and enrich the feature struc-164 Template Name ] Template Slot Default Allowed VMues CLAUSE sentence NOUN-PHRASE mood process-type •mode tense future progressive perfective voice quality np-type person number gender definite regular-noun countable inflected pronominal YES DECLARATIVE type ASCRIPTIVE .nil \"PRESENT NO NO NO ACTIVE POSITIVE COMMON THIRD SINGULAR NEUTRAL NO YES YES YES NO YES, NO DECLARATIVE, YES-N0, WH, IMPERATIVE, T0-INFINITIVE ASCRIPTIVE, MENTAL, MATERIAL, COMPOSITE, POSSESSIVE, LOCATIVE, TEMPORAL, VERBAL, EXISTENTIAL ATTRIBUTI~E,,EQUATIVE,.CAUSATIVE PRESENT, PAST YES, NO YES, N0 YES, N0 ACTIVE, PASSIVE POSITIVE, NEGATIVE COMMON, PROPER FIRST, SECOND, THIRD SINGULAR, PLURAL NEUTRAL, MASCULINE, FEMININE YES, N0, NOART YES, NO YES, NO YES, NO YES, NO","POSSESSOR pronominal YES YES, NO","PRONOUN PERSONAL FIRST SINGULAR NEUTRAL person number gender PERSONAL, OBJECTIVE, REFLEXIVE, POSSESSIVE-PRONOUN, POSSESSIVE-DETERMINER, RELATIVE, DEMONSTRATIVE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD SINGULAR, PLURAL NEUTRAL, MASCULINE, FEMININE","CONJUNCTION sentence NO YES, NO Figure 2: Some Defaults from YAG's Syntactic Templates.","((template CLAUSE)","(process-type MENTAL)","(process \"want\")","(processor ((template CONJUNCTION)","(first ((template NOUN-PHRASE) (head \"Jack\") (np-type PROPER) (gender MASCULINE) ))","(second ((template PRONOUN)) )))","(phenomenon ((template NOUN-PHRASE)","(head \"dog\")","(possessor ((template NOUN-PHRASE)","(head \"sister\")","(gender FEMININE)","• ~(possessor<(template NOUN-PHRASE)","(head \"Jack\")","(np-type PROPER)","(gender MASCULINE)","(pronominal YES)) )))))","(rear-circum ((template CLAUSE) (mood T0-INFINITIVE) (process-type MATERIAL) (process \"swim\")) ) ) Figure 3: A (shorter) Feature Struclur() of the Sentence \"Jack and I want his ._zste7 s dog to swim.\". 165 ture input so that neither the application, nor the templates need to be altered to handle dependencies, like conjunctions, correctly. 3 Attribute Grammars An attribute grammar consists of a context-free grammar, a finite set of attributes, and a set of semantic rules. The ,.C-,on.~eezt-Free :Grammar (CFG) specifies the syntax of a language by expressing how to construct a syntax tree from non-terminal and terminal symbols defined in a language. The Attributes and Semantic Rules specify the semantics. A finite set of attributes is associated with each non-terminal symbol. Each of these sets is divided into two disjoint subsets, namely Inherited Attributes and Synthesized Attributes. Inherited attributes propagate down a syntax tree whereas synthesized attributes propagate upward. A semantic rule specifies how to compute the value of an attribute from others. This specification implicitly defines dependencies among attributes in an attribute grammar, locally (within a production) and globally (among productions). Attribute Evaluation is the process of computing values for every attribute instance in the tree according to the semantic rules defined for each production.","An example of an attribute grammar and its components is given in Figure 4 (adapted from (Alblas, 1991)). This attribute grammar consists of two non-terminals, two terminals, andthree production rules. The inherited attributes of the non-terminal A are a and b. Its synthesized attributes are x and y. No attributes are assigned to the non-terminal S. nonterminals: S, A. terminals: s, t. start symbol: S. description of attributes: a, b: integer, inh of A; x, y: integer, syn of A;","productions and semantic rules: 1) S -> A.

A.y := A.a; A.x := A.b Figure 4: An Example Attribute Grammar.","As mentioned earlier, semantic rules define dependencies among attributes• Figure 5 shows dependency graphs corresponding to the semantic rules of Figure 4.

In other words, we cannot know B before we know A.","4 Extending a Grammar to Enable Generation Gap Analysis To make a generation gap analysis possible, a grammar writer must first extend the grammar of his or her existing generator to capture the propagation semantics of a target language. This extension involves defining attributes (synthesized and inherited) and associated semantic rules. Next, a small program must be built to construct a tree from a given input and retrieve semantic rules and attributes from associated grammar units.","Attribute evaluation begins by instantiating each inherited attribute with values from the input and then the remaining attributes are evaluated. This process is incremental in the sense that new information gained from previous evaluations might lead to the discovery of additional information. When all attributes remain unchanged, or there is a conflict detected in the input, the process terminates. The generator then passes the enriched input to the realization component.","Consider the following fragment of input from Figure 3 that uses the CONJUNCTION template to join a noun phrase and a pronoun.","( (template CONJUNCTION)","(:first ((template NOUN-PHRASE)","(head \"Jack\")","(np-type PROPER)","(gender MASCULINE) ))","(second ((template PRONOUN)) ))","This fragment is the subject of the sentence, therefore features such as person and number would be required to enforce tile subject-verb agreement of English.

In particular, grammars in a template-based system are not restricted to syntactic text structure as they are in phrase-based systems, but mw include either syntactic specifications, semantic specifications, or a mixture of both. Therefore template-based grammars do not restrict derivations on the right side of a production to some specific non-terminals, as they would be in a phrase-based grammar.","In our approach, a template is equivalent to the non-terminal on the left side of a production. Template slots are equivalent to terminals and non-terminals on the right side depending on their value at the time of generation. Slots that are bound to a simple value are considered terminals, while those that are bound to a feature structure are considered non-terminals. The evaluation function of terminals is actually a constant function whose return value is the value to which the terminal has been bound.","We have defined a small language sufficient to specify attribute grammars in a template as given in Figure 10. Additional keywords are also defined. The keyword this refers to the current template. The keywords inh and syn indicate an inherited attribute and a synthesized attribute, respectively.","We have implemented an attribute grammar-based propagation analysis program in Lisp as an extension to YAG. Some templates have been augmented with semantic propagation rules. It was not necessary to define attributes for YAG's template-based grammar because template slots already served as attributes. The program has been able to identify missing information (using the defined semantic propagation rules) and to reject inputs that have a conflict.","Other generation systems that intend to use an attribute grammar approach to enrich their partially-specified input will need to analyze the characteristics of their grammar formalism. Basically, one needs to identify the smallest unit of a grammar (e.g., a category (cat) in FUF/SURGE), and then define semantic rules similar to those presented in this paper for each grammar unit. From a given input, a generator should be able to pick semantic rules associated with information provided in an illput. .~n attribute evaluation is then executed as described. 169 AttributeGrammar ::- EvalRules EvalRules ::- \"(\" EvalRule EvalRules \")\" I nil EvalRule ::- \"(\" Attribute Stmt \")\" Stmt ::- Expr [ CaseStmt [ IfStmt","Expr ::- Attribute [ constant [","\"( ....

Our approach is not intended to replace defaulting mechanisms used in the current generation systems. Instead it improves the quality of input to the generator for better realization. Defaults are still used if the analysis fails to discover useful information. Acknowledgement","The authors are indebted to John T. Boyland for his helpful comments and suggestions.
