These lexicons have been used as a domainindependent semantic resource as well as an evaluation criteria in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).","However, those lexicons are rather complex. For instance, WordNet (version 1.6) contains a total of over 120,000 words and 170,000 word senses, which are grouped into around 100,000"]},{"title":"synsets","paragraphs":["(synonym sets). In addition to the size, word entries in those lexicon are often polysemous. For instance, 20% of the words in Word-net have more than one sense, and the average number of senses of those polysemous words is around 3. Also, the distinction between word senses tends to be ambiguous and arbitrary. For example, the following 6 senses are listed in WordNet for the noun \"door\": 1. door - a swinging or sliding barrier 2. door - the space in a wall 3. door - anything providing a means of","access (or escape) 4. door - a swinging or sliding barrier that","will close off access into a car 5. door - a house that is entered via a door 6. door - a room that is entered via a door","Because of the high degree of ambiguity, using such complex semantic lexicons brings some serious problems to the performance of NLP systems. The first, obvious problem is the computational intractability: increased processing time needed to disambiguate multiple possibilities will necessarily slow down the system. Another problem, which has been receiving atten-tion in the past few years, is the inaccuracy: when there is more than one sense applicable in a given context, different systems (or human in-dividuals) may select different senses as the correct sense. Indeed, recent studies in WSD show that, when sense definitions are fine-grained, similar senses become indistinguishable to human annotators and often cause disagreement on the correct tag (Ng"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1999; Veronis, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1998b). Also in IR and IE tasks, difference in the correct sense assignment will surely degrade recall and precision of the systems. Thus, it is apparent that, in order for a lexicon to be useful as an evaluation criteria for NLP systems, it must represent word senses at the level of granularity that captures human intuition.","In Lexical Semantics, several approaches have been proposed which organize a lexicon based on"]},{"title":"systematic polysemy: 1","paragraphs":["a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable","ISystematic polysemy (in the sense we use in this paper) is also referred to as"]},{"title":"regular polysemy","paragraphs":["(Apresjan, 1973) or"]},{"title":"logical polyseray","paragraphs":["(Pustejovsky, 1995). 20 ways (e.g. ANIMAL and MEAT meanings of the word \"chicken\"). 2 In particular, (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998) identified systematic relations that exist between abstract semantic concepts in the WordNet noun hierarchy, and defined a set of underspecified semantic classes that represent the relations. Then he extracted all polysemous nouns in WordNet according to those underspecified classes and built a lexicon called CORELEX. For example, a CORELEX class AQU (which represents a relation between ARTIFACT and QUANTITY) contains words such as \"bottle\", \"bucket\" and \"spoon\".","Using the abstract semantic classes and organizing a lexicon based on systematic polysemy addresses the two problems mentioned above in the following ways. For the first problem, using the abstract classes can reduce the size of the lexicon by combining several related senses into one sense; thus computation becomes more efficient. For the second problem, systematic polysemy does reflect our general intuitions on word meanings. Although the distinction between systematic vs. non-systematic relations (or related vs. unrelated meanings) is sometimes unclear, systematicity of the related senses among words is quite intuitive and has been well studied in Lexical Semantics (for example, (Apresjan, 1973; Cruse, 1986; Nunberg, 1995; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995)).","However, there is one critical issue still to be addressed: the level of granularity at which the abstract classes are defined. The problem is that, when the granularity of the abstract classes is too coarse, systematic relations defined at that level may not hold uniformly at more fine-grained levels (Vossen et al., 1999). For instance, the CORELEX class AQU mentioned above also contains a word \"dose\" .3 Here, the relation between the senses of \"dose\" is different from that of \"bottle\", \"bucket\" and \"spoon\", which can be labeled as CONTAINER-CONTAINERFUL relation. We argue that human intuitions can distinguish meanings","2Note that systematic polysemy should be contrasted with homonymy which refers to words which have more than one unrelated sense (e.g. FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION and SLOPING_LAND meanings of the word \"bank\").","3Senses of \"dose\" in WordNet are: (1) a measured portion of medicine taken at any one time, and (2) the quantity of an active agent (substance or radiation) taken in or absorbed at any one time.

Most often, this procedure is done manually. For example, the current version of WordNet (1.6) encodes the similarity between word senses (or synsets) by a relation called cousin. But those cousin relations were identified manually by the WordNet lexicographers. A similar effort was also made in the EuroWordnet project (Vossen et al., 1999). However, manually inspecting a large, complex lexicon is very time-consuming and often prone to inconsistencies.","In this paper, we propose a method which automatically extracts systematic polysemy from a hierarchically organized semantic lexicon (WordNet). Our method uses a modification of a tree generalization technique used in (Li and Abe, 1998), and generates a tree-cut, which is a list of clusters that partition a tree. Then, we compare the systematic relations extracted by our automatic method to the WordNet cousins. Preliminary results show that our method discovered most of the WordNet cousins as well as some more interesting relations.","2 Tree Generalization using Tree-cut and MDL Before we present our method, we first give a brief summary of the tree-cut technique which we adopted from (Li and Abe, 1998). This technique is used to acquire generalized case frame patterns from a corpus using a thesaurus tree. 2.1 Tree-cut Models A thesaurus tree is a hierarchically organized lexicon where leaf nodes encode lexical data 21 (i.e., words) and internal nodes represent abstract semantic classes.

The best model is the one with the tree-cut [AIRCRAFT, ball, kite, puzzle] indicated by a thick curve in the figure. 3 Clustering Systematic Polysemy 3.1 Generalization Technique Using the generalization technique in (Li and Abe, 1998) described in the previous section, we wish to extract systematic polysemy automatically from WordNet. Our assumption is that, if a semantic concept is systematically related to another concept, words that have one sense under one concept (sub)tree are likely to have another sense under the other concept (sub)tree. To give an example, Figure 3 shows parts of WordNet noun trees for ARTIFACT and MEASURE, where subtrees under CONTAINER and C0NTAINERFUL respectively contain \"bottle\", \"bucket\" and \"spoon\". Note a dashed line in the figure indicates an indirect link for more than one level.","Based on this assumption, it seems systematic polysemy in the two trees can be extracted straight-forwardly by clustering each tree according to polysemy as a feature, and by matching of clusters taken from each tree. 6 To this end, the notion of tree-cut and the MDL principle seem to comprise an excellent tool.","However, we must be careful in adopting Li and Abe's technique directly: since the problem which their technique was applied to is fundamentally different from ours, some procedures used in their problem may not have any interpretation in our problem. Although both problems are essentially a tree generalization problem, their problem estimates the true probability distribution from a random sample of examples (a corpus), whereas our problem does not have any additional data to estimate, since all data (a lexicon) is already known. This difference raises the following issue. In the calculation of the data description length in equa-tion (6), each word in a cluster, observed or unobserved, is assigned an estimated probability, which is a uniform fraction of the probability of the cluster. This procedure does not have interpretation if it is applied to our problem. Instead, we use the distribution of feature frequency proportion of the clusters, and calculate the data description length by the following for-mula: k"]},{"title":"L(SIF, e) = - f(Ci)","paragraphs":["× log2P(Ci) (9) i=l where F = [C1,.., Ck], 0 = [P(C,),.., P(Ck)].

But before we apply the method, we must transform the data in Wordnet. This is because WordNet differs from a theaurus tree in two ways: it is a graph rather than a tree, and internal nodes as well as leaf nodes carry data, First, we eliminate multiple inheritance by separating shared subtrees. Second, we bring down every internal node to a leaf level by creating a new duplicate node and adding it as a child of the old node (thus making the old node an internal node).","After trees are transformed, our method extracts systematic polysemy by the following three steps. In the first step, all leaf nodes of the two trees are marked with either 1 or 0 (1 if a node/word appears in both trees, or 0 otherwise),","In the second step, the generalization technique is applied to each tree, and two tree-cuts are obtained. To search for the best tree-cut, instead of computing the description length for M1 possible tree-cuts in a tree, a greedy dynamic programming algorithm is used. This algorithm , called Find-MDL in (Li and Abe, 1998), finds the best tree-cut for a tree by recursively finding the best tree-cuts for all of its subtrees and merging them from bottom up. This algorithm is quite efficient, since it is basically a depth-first search with minor overhead for computing the description length.","Finally in the third step, clusters from the two tree-cuts are matched up, and the pairs which have substantial overlap are selected as systematic polysemy.","Figure 4 shows parts of the final tree-cuts for ARTIFACT and MEASURE obtained by our method. ~ In both trees, most of the clusters in the tree-cuts are from nodes at depth 1 (count-ing the root as depth 0). That is because the tree-cut technique used in our method is sensitive to the structure of the tree. More specifically, the MDL principle inherently penalizes a complex tree-cut by assigning a long parameter length. Therefore, unless the entropy of the feature distribution is large enough to make the data length overshadow the parameter length, simpler tree-cuts partitioned at abstract levels are preferred. This situation tends to happen often when the tree is bushy and the total feature frequency is low. This was precisely the case with ARTIFACT and MEASURE, where both","Tin the figure, bold letters indicate words which are polysemous in the two tree. 24 ARTIFACT 0,","STRUCTURE INSTRUMEN- ARTICLE TALITY"]},{"title":"/i\\ base","paragraphs":["!building J/ ~ MEDICINE~ 10.02 foot IMPLEMENT DEVICE CONTAINER / ~ TABLEWARE"]},{"title":"/\\","paragraphs":["UTENSIL ROD"]},{"title":"J\\","paragraphs":["mixer porcelain yard / '\"...

Then we evaluated those pairs in two aspects: related vs. unrelated relations, and automatic vs. manual clusters. 4.1 Related vs. Unrelated Clusters Of the cluster pairs we extracted automatically, not all are systematically related; some are unrelated, homonymous relations. They are essentially false positives for our purposes. Table 1 shows the number of related and unrelated relations in the extracted cluster pairs.","Although the results vary among category combinations, the ratio of the related pairs is rather low: less than 60% on average. There are several reasons for this. First, there are some pairs whose relations are spurious. For example, in ARTIFACT-GROUP class, a pair [LUMBER, SOCIAL_GROUP] was extracted. Words which are common in the two clusters are \"picket\", \"board\" and \"stock\". This relation is obviously homonymous.","Second, some clusters obtained by tree-cut are rather abstract, so that pairing two abstract clusters results in an unrelated pair. For example, in ARTIFACT-MEASURE class, a pair [INSTRUMENTALITY, LINEAR_UNIT] was selected. Words which are common in the two clusters include \"yard\", \"foot\" and \"knot\" (see the previous Figure 4). Here, the concept INSTRUMENTALITY is very general (at depth 1), and it also contains many (polysemous) words. So, matching this cluster with another abstract cluster is likely to yield a pair which has just enough overlapping words but whose relation is not systematic. In the case of [INSTRUMENTALITY, LINEAR_UNIT], the situation is even worse, because the concept of LINEAR_UNIT in MEASURE represents a collection of terms that were chosen arbitrarily in the his-25 Table 1: Related vs. Unrelated Relations Top relation class Related Unrelated ACTION-L0CATION ARTIFACT-GROUP ARTIFACT-MEASURE ARTIFACT-SUBSTANCE COMMUNICATION-PERSON 10 1 18 9 7 19 19 12 12 11","Total 66 52 Total 11 27 26 31 23 118 % of","related 90.9 66.7 26.9 61.3 52.2 55.9 tory of the English language. 4.2 Automatic vs. Manual Clusters To compare the cluster pairs our method extracted automatically to manually extracted clusters, we use WordNet cousins. A cousin relation is relatively new in WordNet, and the coverage is still incomplete. However, it gives us a good measure to see whether our automatic method discovered systematic relations that correspond to human intuitions.","A cousin relation in WordNet is defined between two synsets (currently in the noun trees only), and it indicates that senses of a word that appear in both of the (sub)trees rooted by those synsets are related, s The cousins were manuMly extracted by the WordNet lexicographers.
