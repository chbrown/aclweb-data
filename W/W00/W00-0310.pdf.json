In this paper, we show how speech generation can be more closely coupled with the dialogue manager of a working mixed-initiative spoken dialogue system. In particular, we use representations from the semantic interpretation, task model and dialogue strategy modules to better communicate the meaning of system replies through prosodically appropriate synthetic speech.","While dialogue prosody has been a topic of much study, our implemented concept-to-speech (CTS) system offers original proposals for specific couplings of dialogue computation with prosodic computation.

Below, we present the important fundamental definitions and principles of intonation underlying our CTS system. 2.1 Intonational System In our CTS system, the prosodic elements that are computed are based on the intonational system of Pierrehumbert (1980), who defined a formal language for describing American English intonation using the following regular grammar: Inton Phrase ---~ (Interm Phrase) + Bndry Tone Interm Phrase ~ (Pitch Acc)+ Phrase Ace Major phrases, or inlonational phrases, are made up of one or more minor phrases, or inlermediale phrases. Melodic movements in intermediate and intonational phrases are in turn expressed by three kinds of tonal elements. These include six pilch accents: a low pitch excursion (L*), a high pitch excursion (H*), or a combination of both low and high excursions (L*+H, L+H*, H*+L, It+L*); two phrase accents: a high (H-) or low (L-) tonal target that guides the interpolation of the melodic contour from final pitch accent to intermediate phrase ending; and two boundary lones: a high (H%) or low (L%) tonal target that guides interpolation from phrase accent to intonational phrase ending. 2.2 Intonational Meaning Theoretical work on intonational meaning has at-tempted to relate the grammatical elements of Pierrehumbert's system -- pitch accent, phrase accent and boundary tone, to interpretive processes at different levels of discourse and dialogue structure. Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) conjectured that the absence or presence of accentuation conveys discourse focus status, while the tonal properties of the accent itself (i.e. pitch accent type) convey semantic focus information."]},{"title":"48","paragraphs":["MIMIC:","User: MIMIC:","User: MIMIC: hello this is mimic the movie information system how can I help you where in hoboken is october sky playing october sky is playing at hoboken cinema in hoboken can I help you with anything else when is it playing there october sky is playing at hoboken cinema in hoboken at 3:45pm, 5:50pm, 7:lOpm, and lOpm can i help you with anything else Figure 1: A MIMIC dialogue.","In later work, pitch accent type was said to express whether the accented information was in-tended by the speaker to be \"predicated\" or not by the hearer (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990). Nompredicated-~forernation was said to bear low-star accentuation (L*-, L*+H, H+L*), while predicated information would be marked by high-star accents (H*, L+H*, H*+L). The theory further stated that L*+H conveys uncertainty or lack of speaker commitment to the expressed propositional content, while L+H* marks correction or contrast. The complex accent, H*+L, was said to convey that an inference path was required to support the predication; usage of H+L* similarly was said to imply an inference path, but did not suggest a predication of a mutual belief. Finally, phrase accents and boundary tones were said to reflect aspects of discourse structure."]},{"title":"3 Systems Foundations","paragraphs":["Our task is to improve the communicative competence of a spoken dialogue agent, by making recourse to our knowledge of intonational meaning, dialogue processing and relations between the two. Of course, a worthwhile CTS system must also outperform out-of-the-box text-to-speech (TTS) systems that may determine prosodic mark-up in linguistically sophisticated ways. As in (Nakatani, 1998), we take the prosodic output of an advanced research system that implements the Pierrehumbert theory of intonation, namely the Bell Labs TTS system, as our baseline experimental system to be enhanced by CTS algorithms. We embed the CTS system in MIMIC, a working spoken dialogue system representing state-of-the-art dialogue management practices, to develop CTS algorithms that can be eventually realistically evaluated using task-based performance metrics.","3.1 Dialogue System: Mixed-Initiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) The dialogue system whose baseline speech generation capabilities we enhance is the Mixed-Initiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) (Chu-Carroll, 2000). MIMIC\" provides movie listing information involving knowledge about towns, theaters, movies and showtimes, as demonstrated in Figure 1. MIMIC currently utilizes template-driven text generation, and passes on text strings to a stand-alone TTS system. In the version of MIMIC enhanced with concept-to-speech capabilities, MIMIC-CTS, contextual knowledge is used to modify the prosodic features of the slot and filler material in the templates; we are currently integrat-ing the algorithms in MIMIC-CTS with a grammar-driven generation system. Further details of MIMIC are presented in the relevant sections below, but see (Chu-Carroll, 2000) for a complete overview. 3.2 TTS: The Bell Labs System For default prosodic processing and speech synthesis realization, we use a research version of the Bell Labs TTS System, circa 1992 (Sproat, 1997), that generates intonational contours based on Pierrehumbert's intonation theory (1980), as described in (Pierrehumbert, 1981). Of relevance is the fact that various pitch accent types, phrase accent and boundary tones in Pierrehumbert's theory are directly implemented in this system, so that by generating a Pierrehumbert-style prosodic transcription, the work of the CTS system is done. More precisely, MIMIC-CTS computes prosodic annotations that override the default prosodic processing that is performed by the Bell Labs TTS system.","To our knowledge, the intonation component of the Bell Labs TTS system utilizes more linguistic knowledge to compute prosodic annotations than any other unrestricted TTS system, so it is reasonable to assume that improvements upon it are meaningful in practice as well as in theory."]},{"title":"4 MIMIC's Concept-to-Speech Component (MIMIC-CTS)","paragraphs":["In MIMIC-CTS, the MIMIC dialogue system is enhanced with a CTS component to better communicate the meaning of system replies through contextually conditioned prosodic features.

Even such minimal use of dialogue information can make a difference. For example, changing the default accent for the following utterance highlights the kind of information that the system is seeking, instead of highlighting the semantically vacuous main verb, like: 2 Default TTS: what movie would you LIKE MIMIC-CTS: what MOVIE would you like 4.2 Conveying Information Status using","the Task Model MIMIC performs a set of information-giving tasks, i.e. what, where, when, location, that are concisely defined by a task model.

For instance, a theater name may be inferred given a town name, if there is only one theater in the given town. OLD information is inherited from the discourse history, based on updating rules relying on confidence scores for attribute values. HEARER-NEW information (c.f. (Prince, 1988)) is that which is requested by the user, and constitutes the only new information on the scale. But note that KEY information, while given, is still clearly in discourse focus, along with HEARER-NEW information.","The next step is to map the information statuses, ordered from given to new, to a scale of pitch accent, or accent melodies, ordered from given to new as follows: L* L*÷H L+H* H*"]},{"title":"&ivan] [new]","paragraphs":["Table 1 summarizes this original mapping of information statuses to pitch accent melodies, and Figure 4 illustrates the use of this mapping in an example.

Instead, the principle is operationalized here in a practically motivated manner that is consistent with and perhaps illuminating of the theory.","4.3 Assigning \"Dialogue Prosody\" using Dialogue Strategies As in earlier CTS systems, special logico-semantic relations, such as contrast or correction, are effectively conveyed in MIMIC-CTS by prosodic cues. In MIMIC-CTS, however, these situations are not stipulated in an ad hoc manner, but can be determined to a large degree by MIMIC's dialogue strategy selection process that identifies appropriate dialogue acts to realize a dialogue goal. a","For example, the dialogue act ANSWER may be selected to achieve the dialogue goal of providing an answer to a successful user query, while the dialogue act NOTIFYFAILURE may be performed to achieve the dialogue goal of providing an answer in situations where no movie listing in the database matches the user query. The template associated with the dialogue act, NOTIFYFAILURE, when compared with that for ANSWER, contains an additional negative auxiliary associated with the key attribute responsible for the query failure, in an utterance conveying a contradiction in beliefs between the user and system (namely, the presupposition on the part of the user that the query can be satisfied).","Theoretical work on intonational interpretation leads us to prosodically mark the negative auxiliary, as well as the associated focus position (Rooth, 1985).

Together, MIMIC-CTS's computation of accentuation, pitch accent type and dialogue prosody constitutes the most general and complete implementation of a compositional theory of intonational meaning in a CTS system to date.","Nevertheless, elements of a handful of previous CTS systems support the approaches taken in MIMIC-CTS toward conveying semantic, task and dialogue level meaning. For example, the Direction Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a discourse structure for generated directions.

Ultimately; the value of MIMIC-CTS must be measured based on its contribution to overall task peformance by real MIMIC users. Such a study is under design, following (Chu-Carroll and Nickerson, 2000).","In conclusion, we have shown how prosodic computation can be conditioned on various dialogue representations, for robust and domain-independent CTS synthesis. -While some rules for prosody assignment depend on the task model, others must be tied closely to the particular choices of content in the replies, at the level of dialogue goals and dialogue acts. At this level as well, however, linguistic principles of intonation interpretation can be applied to determine the mappings. In sum, the lesson learned is that a unitary notion of \"concept\" from which we generate a unitary prosodic structure, does not apply to state-of-the-art spoken dialogue generation. Instead, the representation of dialogue meaning in experimental architectures, such as MIMIC's, is compositional to some degree, and we take advantage of this fact to implement a compositional theory of intonational meaning in a new concept-to-speech system, MIMIC-CTS.
