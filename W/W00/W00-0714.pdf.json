In order to incorporate long-distance information into the ME framework in a language model, a Whole Sentence Maximum Entropy Language Model (WSME) could be used. Until now MonteCarlo Markov Chains (MCMC) sampling techniques has been used to estimate the paramenters of the WSME model. In this paper, we propose the application of another sampling technique: the Perfect Sampling (PS). The experiment has shown a reduction of 30% in the perplexity of the WSME model over the trigram model and a reduction of 2% over the WSME model trained with MCMC. 1 Introduction The language modeling problem may be defined as the problem of calculating the probability of a string,"]},{"title":"p(w) = p(wl,..., Wn).","paragraphs":["The probability"]},{"title":"p(w)","paragraphs":["is usually calculated via conditional probabilities.

The first algorithm of the family of PS was presented by Propp and Wilson (Propp and Wilson, 1996) under the name Coupling From the Past (CFP) and is as follows: start a path in 80 every state of S at some time (-T) in the past such that at time n = 0, all the paths collapse to a unique value (due to the ergodicity). This value is a sample element. In the majority of cases, the state space is huge, so attempting to begin a path in every state is not practical. Thus, we can define a partial stochastic order in the state space and so we only need start two paths: one in the minimum and one in the maximum. The two paths collapse at time n = 0 and the value of the coalescence state is a sample element of ~-. The CFP algorithm first determines the time T to start and then runs the two paths from time (-T) to 0. Information about PS methods may be consulted in (Corcoran and Tweedie, 1998; Propp and Wilson, 1998). 4 Experimental work In this work, we have made preliminary experiments using PS in the estimation of the expected value (4) during the learning of the parameters of a WSME model. We have implemented the Cai algorithm (Cai, 1999) to obtain perfect samples. The Cai algorithm has the advantage that it doesn't need the definition of the partial order.","The experiments were carried out using a pseudonatural corpus: \"the traveler task \"1. The traveler task consists in dialogs between travelers and hotel clerks. The size of the vocabulary is 693 words. The training set has 490,000 sentences and 4,748,690 words. The test set has 10,000 sentences and 97,153 words.","Three kinds of features were used in the WSME model: n-grams (1-grams, 2-grams, 3grams), distance 2 n-grams (d2-2-grams, d2-3grams) and triggers. The proposal prior distribution used was a trigram model.","We trained WSME models with different sets of features using the two sampling techniques: MCMC and PS. We measured the perplexity (PP) of each of the models and obtained the percentage of improvement in the PP with respect to a trigram base-line model (see table 1). The first model used MCMC techniques (specifically the Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (IMH) 2) and features of n-grams and distance 2 n-grams. The second model used a 1EuTrans ESPRIT-LTR Project 20268 2IMH has been reported recently as the most useful","MCMC algorithm used in the WSME training process.

The base-line model is a trigram model (Trigram) PS algorithm and features of n-grams and distance 2 n-grams. The third model used the IMH algorithm and features of triggers. The fourth used PS and features of triggers. Finally, in order to compare with the classical methods, we included the trigram base-line model.","In all cases, the WSME had a better performance than the n-gram model. From the results in Table 1, we see that the use of features of triggers improves the performance of the model more than the use of n-gram features, this may be due to the correlation between the triggers and the n-grams, the n-gram information has been absorbed by the prior distribution and diminishes the effects of the feature of n-grams. We believe this is the reason why PS-T in Table 1 is better than PS. We also see how IMH and IHM-T shows the same improvement, i.e. the use of triggers does not seem improve the perplexity of the model but, this may be due to the sampling technique: the parameter values depends on the estimation of an expected value, and the estimation depends on the sampling. Finally, the PS-T has better perplexity than the IMH-T. The only difference between both of these is the sampling technique,neither of then has the correlation influence in the features, so we think that the improvement may be due to the sampling technique. 5 Conclusion and future works We have presented a different approach to the sampling step needed in the parameter estimation of a WSME model. Using this technique, we have obtained a reduction of 30% in the perplexity of the WSME model over the base-line 81 trigram model and an improvement of 2% over the model trained with MCMC techniques. We are extending our experiments to a major corpus: the Wall Street Journal corpus and using a set of features which is more general, including features that reflect the global structure of the sentence. We are working on introducing the grammatical information contained into the sentence to the model; we believe that such information improves the quality of the model significantly.","References","J.
