First, we describe some complexity aspects of spoken dialogue. It is shown that, given the internal set-ting of our dialogue system, it is im-possible to test even a small percentage of the theoretically possible utterances in a reasonable amount of time. An even smaller part of possible dialogues can thus be tested. Second, an approach for early testing of the dialogue manager of a dialogue system, without the complete system being put together, is described. 'C 1 Introduction On the one hand, it is important for the developers of a dialogue system that the system is robust (i.e., it does not fail or loop), easy to use and is efficient. On the other hand, the testing of a dialogue system is cumbersome and expensive. Factors like the effectiveness and naturalness of the system, as well as robustness are problematic to evaluate. While test suites for analysis components have been around for a while, their counterparts for dialogue managers (henceforth DM) are (to our knowledge) non existent. Evaluation as such has been target for a lot of rm3earch. Recently more or less automatic testing and evaluation","The authors wishes to thank Raft Engel for help with the ~plementation and Norbert Reithinger, Tilmau Becket, Christer Samuelsson and Thorsten Brantz for comments on earlier drafts and fruitful discussions. methods has been proposed (e.g. (Eckert et al., 1998; Scheffier and Young, 2000; Lin and"]},{"title":"Lee, 2000)).","paragraphs":["A special problem for the development and testing of a DM is that one often has to wait until the whole system (including speech recognizer(s) and synthesis, parser/generator etc.) has been integrated. Moreover, to test the complete system one usually has to put people (e.g. the system developers or beta testers) in front of the system, feeding it with \"appropriate input.\" Using the developers of the system as testers has the potential disadvantage that the system will just be tested with the type of phenomena or dialogues the developer has in mind. (S)he also has knowledge about the internals of the system and this can influence the testing in unpredictable ways (Araki and Doshita, 1997). Another important factor for the testing of DMs concerned with spoken input is speech recognition errors and their effects on the input.","As we started this project, the following goals and experiences guided us:","• It is cumbersome to test the DM with the complete system at hand. Although this testing is necessary, we would like to minimize the test effort necessary.","• We must reach a status of the DM where it is as error free as possible. There must not be any technical bugs in the program itseff as well as logical bugs, or put in other words: The DM must not fail on any input.","• People behave weird (Eckert etal., 1995). To us there is no hard borderline between legal moves and non legal 160 moves in a dialogue. Some moves make more sense than others, but can the user be obliged to say only certain things at a certain point in a conversation? We think not! A dialogue system should be able to react on any input, how weird it might be.","• Speech Recognizers makes errors. For our dialogue system with a large vocabnlary, the recognition rate drops to between 70 and 80% for certain problematic speakers. Consequently every fourth or fifth word can be wrong. An average user contribution contains 5 words in the application we refer to here (Ehrlich et al., 1997), not including single-word utterances in the calculation. Thus, every utterance may contain a falsely recognized word that may or may not be important for parsing or semantic construction.","To overcome some of the problems stated above and to find errors as early as possible during the course of developing a dialogue system, we have developed a validation tool - VALDIA - for the automatic testing of the DM. The overall goal we had in mind was to be able to obtain a status of the DM such that it at least does not contain any loops or other fatal (trivial) dialogue strategy errors. To be-come independent of the completion status of the overall system, we decided to peel the interfacing components (parser, generator,...) away from the DM. We now view the DM as a black box. This black box is then fed with random generated input in some interface language and we observe how the DM reacts on the given input. An important prerequisite is of course that the interface between the analysis component and the DM is defined.","At this point we would like to emphasize that our dialogue system is not modeled with \"finite state dialogue structure\" and \"allow-able syntax\" for each state as described in (Scheffier and Young, 2000). In our view such a system is simple to test, since the system will just recognize those utterances it is designed to process. In such a scenario one can use the dialogue model for, e.g., enumerating every possible dialogue or generate \"coherent\" dialogues. On the other hand, our system puts no limits on what is allowed to say at a certain point in the dialogue, which makes the task of automatic testing non-trivial.","Ideally one would want to perform an exhaustive testing the DM with, say, all possible dialogues, i.e., sequences of user contributions and the respective system reactions. User contributions are supposed to have a maximum length in terms of semantic items. An investigation of the complexity of the number of possible utterances (in terms of combinations of semantic expressions) and resulting possible dialogues showed that for our DM, the testing task is so complex that the universe of possible semantic expressions cannot be tested in a reasonable amount of time (see Section ??).","Looking at the complexity of the task one is tempted to ask - \"is it possible to exhaustively produce all possible dialogues of a certain length?\" Or maybe more interesting: \"can we feed the DM with all the generated dialogues?\" In (Levin and Pieracciui, 1997) a sketch of a method to find good dialogue strategies was put forward. The authors argue that a dialogue system can be modeled in terms of a state space, an action set and a strategy. They show how one could automatically find an optimal strategy by feeding the system with all possible dialogues, or in our terminology sequences of user contributions. We took the natural continuation of this: to automatically generate user contributions or dialogues and feed them to the system, and then let the system find the optimal strategy itself. In this paper we explore some aspects and limitations of such an approach by analyzing the complexity of dialogues. We will, for instance, show that even if a dialogue manager can process one or ten or even one hundred user contribution(s) per second we cannot find an optimal strategy based on exhaustive search - the search space is simply too large!","The paper starts with a brief description of the architecture of the DM and the test envi-161"]},{"title":"I Speaker ~I Aucllo ~ independent I wora l - xn Speech Lattice Recognition I -I Audlo Syn.t,h","paragraphs":[": Synthesis -"]},{"title":"Parsing enotion If","paragraphs":["Dialog Manager Figure 1: Schematic architecture for our dialogue system. ronment for VALDIA, and a description of its input format. We then discuss the complexity of an utterance, continuing with the complexity of dialogues. Finally, VALDIA is described in more detail and then the paper is closed by a discussion of relevant results and papers. 2 Architecture The dialogue system to which we first applied VALDIA (Heister~mp and McGlashan, 1996; Ehrlich et al., 1997) was designed for answer-ing questions about and/or selling insurances in the domain of car insurances. In case of .failure or problems with the dialogue, the system passes the customer to a human operator. The architecture of the system includes an HMM-based speaker independent speech recognizer, an island parser, DM, generator and synthesizer as depicted in figure 1. The system also includes a data base which is accessed for the retrieval of domain specific in-formation. It is important for this paper that the speech recognizer is not limited to \"allowed user contributions\" but outputs a word hypotheses lattice or the best; chain which is processed by an island parser. Thus, the input to the DM might, depending on recognition quality, consist of arbitrary sequences of semantic expressions. A basic requirement is that the DM is not allowed to fail on any of these inputs.","For testing, we peel the interfacing components away from the DM and regard the DM as a black box. It is assumed that we send a piece of input to the DM which then reacts in a way we can observe (for instance by returnlng/generating some output). We assume that the DM has no notion of time. This mean.q that to test the DM, we simply have to feed it with input and wait for it to acknowledge this by sending a responsive output request. In looking at the response, however, we have to be sensitive to effects like timeout (e.g., the DM is \"thinking\" too long) and/or loops (e.g., the DM outputs the same item all the time). Although in (Levin and Pieraccini, 1997) the utterances triggering the actions are not mentioned at all, this is very important. In general we don't know which utterance will trigger a certz.in action when the DM is in a certain state, or if the DM needs an utterante at all to perform another action. As the exhaustive validation criteria for the DM do not allow us to assume any insight into the DM itself, we have to simply feed it with all possible sequences of utterances.","Our test architecture is shown in figure 2. We connect to the DM at the same place as the analysis. We also watch the output sent to the generator. Additionally we watch the process status of the DM, that is we notice if the DM fails or breaks. In that case we can restart the DM and continue the testing. 3 Complexity This section puts forward some notes on the complexity of dialogue.

However, we were certainly surprised by the results ourselves and it has consequences for the degree of coverage and testing one can achieve. For our dialogue system the semantic representation formalism is simple. It consists of propositional content represented as sequences of semantic objects the SIL 1 representation language (McGlashan et al., 1994). Here is one example: \"Ein Audi 80 Avant Quattro mit ber 100 PS\" \"An Audi 80 Sta-tion Wagon Jx4 with over 100 hp\" [ [type :"]},{"title":"car_type,","paragraphs":["[l;hemake : manu£ acturer, value : aud£],"]},{"title":"[thetype: type_name, value: achtzig], [theversion: version_name, value: avant], [thespecial£eature :feature_name, value : quattro], def : indef], [type: power, themeasuretype : ps, thevalue: [type: number,","paragraphs":["cvalue:"]},{"title":"125, modus: [rel : above] ], modus : Ire1: with] ] ]","paragraphs":["This representation is motivated by the fact that the analysis component is an island 1 Semantic Interface Language parser (Hanrieder, 1996), and can thus find islands or sequences of semantic objects. 3.1 The complexity of an utterance The basic entity is a semantic object (S) which is an atomic item treated by the DM. The DM knows about (and thus can treat or react on) M different semantic objects. Examples of a semantic object are cmc_type, power, greeting, bye, integer, and year. We will not pay attention to the fact that a semantic item could be instantiated with, e.g., a street name - in the navigation domain there exist about 42,000 different names of cities in Germany, and Berlin has 11,500 different street names - but we could of course extend the discussion below (on the cost of complexity).","We call a user contribution an utterance. We assume that an utterance U is a (possibly empty) sequence of semantic objects. This can of course be relaxed to sequences or trees in some algebra, but for this discussion it sufrices to deal with sequences - as we will see, the complexity is \"complex enough\" with this assumption. A sentence can consist of max O number of semantic objects. An utterance is a multi-set in the real system, but for this discussion we assume an utterance is not.

To process all possible utterances we would need more than six years! ..:, Obviously, the current parameters of the system make the complexity of the number of utterances intractable in realistic settings. Figure 3 shows how different parameter set-ting affects the cardinality of utterances for different values of M. The (logarithmic) yaxis represents the cardinality of utterances, and the (linear) x-axis the maximal number of semantic items in one utterance. As can be seen, for our DM, we will have to limit, e.g., the number of semantic items to 6 per utterance if we want to test all utterances in one week. 3.2 The complexity of dialogue A dialogue can - at least theoretically - consist of a sequence of the same utterance. Many of the dialogues will of course be non-cooperative and very lmnatural or, put in other words, not legal. But, as indicated above, it is important to us tlhat the DM does not fail on any input.

While testing the DIALOGUE MANAGER with them we thereby encounter a certain number of (or even zero) errors, it is interesting to be able to say something about how error-free the DM is. For this discussion, it is important that by viewing the DM as a black box, we can not do anything more than assuming the errors to be distributed according to the norreal distribution. Moreover, we can only apply this reasoning if we do a large number of observations. The figures below may - depending on the theoretical number of dialogues - not be valid. By using the approxhnation of the normal distribution we know that if we tested N = 10000 dialogues and received errors in DM in, say, 250 of the dialogues (-,z f = 2so = 0.025), we can say Y~6 that the DM contains (with a degree of confidence of 95%) = = s* 1.96 × =","0.025 .1.96 × 0.025 :t: 0.003 percent errors.

It records both the input and the output to and from the DM and checks for special messages (e.g. end of dialogue), crashes, if the DM is emitting the same response all the time, or other events events that indicate erroneous behaviour of the DM. It also creates test pro-files and checkpoint files to enable interrup-tion and restart of test runs.","The interface handles the connection between VALDIA and the DM. It realizes a TCP/IP connection to and from the DM. In case parallel test runs are made, it can also handle different processes.","The motivation for the stochastic automaton editor and, at the same time, the main feature of VALDLA (see Figure 4) is that it allows for the design of utterances or even dialogues or utterance sequences, and thus test specific areas in the space of theoretically possible dialogues.

The arcs between the states are augmented with probabilities which guide state transitions in a stochastic m~uner, thus creating certain sequences by preference, without completely excluding others. In Figure 5 the left row contaius the basic semantic entities, the middle the probability, and the right one the number of occurrences for that particular semantic item in each utterance. For the semantic items the variable parts are linked to another window where the .... their instantiations are described. The constraints are semi-automatically derived from the definition of the interface specification for the DM. The reason for \"semi-automatically\" and not automatically is that we have had no time to write a generic function for this. But, basically the derivation is straightforward. Consequently we can design interesting utterance sequences, according to, e.g., experiences gained during WOZ-experhnents-166 Figure 5: Part of the constraints of an utterance","Finally, by using just one state and no constraints, we can, of course, produce completely arbitrary utterance sequences.","During the testing of the dialogue manager we can run the system in two modes. The first - exhaustive mode - generates all sequences of dialogues by enumerating all dialogues. This is based on the enumeration of all possible utterances in each state. The exhaustive mode can be used when we know that the complexity of the automaton (and utterances) is testable - VALDIA can compute the number of dialogues and compute an upper time limit based on the computational power of the DM. In the second mode - Monte Carlo mode - the utterance generation in each state as well as the change of state is random. In this way we randomly wa.lk~ the automaton and randomly generate utterance profiles. This has been proven useful in the cases where we number of possible dialogues to large is for exhaustive testing.","Notice that we can not pay any attention to legal moves. VALDIA has (i) no knowledge about what a legal move is, and (ii) no possibility to react on the response from the DM. Therefore the \"legal moves\" and \"cooperativeness\" is non existent concepts here. But, this is what we want: People behave weird! Our speech recognizer produces errors! And 167 most important: We have to live with this, and must not fail on any input! 5 First Results During the development of VALDIA we have detected several errors in the implementation of our DM. Most of the errors where logical errors of the kind \"Now that's a combination of things we didn't cover.\" e.g., the co-occurence of good_bye and request_repetition in a user utterance led to a goal conflict in the DM that caused it to hang, as did the non-exclusive handling of disjunction in"]},{"title":"\"It's older (or) younger than 5 years\",","paragraphs":["etc.","Additionally we discovered that the DM in some of the test runs crashed ~ffter about 500 (l) dialogues due to erroneous memory handling.

Consequently, we will have to develop functionality for condensing the trace information. 6 Conclusion -The project VALDIA has produced useful in-sights into the complexity of dialogue: Spoken dialogue is very complex! Exhaustive testing of a DM is for some scenarios/dialogue models impossible. The results were obtained during the development of a test program for a DM. Purpose of the testing was to be able to in-tegrate a DM into the dialogue system which contained as few errors as possible. We would like to highlight the following points:","• VALDIA has proven its usefulness in that it is able to detect errors in the implementation of DMs"]},{"title":"before',","paragraphs":["it is integrated into the complete dialogue system. During the testing we encountered, in addi-tion to logical bugs, errors which would never be detected during normal testing with the complete dialogue system.","• By including the automata into Vm.,- DIA it is possible to concentrate the testing on \"interesting utterance sequences\" and, despite the huge universe of theoretically possible dialogues, obtain a status of the DM which for certain tasks is well tested. It is simple to adapt for the testing of a new DM. Technically the only thing that has to changed is the definition/constraints of the definition utterances. This is at present a semi-automatic process. Conceptually the automata has to be defined, unless one wants to test in Monte Carlo mode. In the current implementation VALDIA uses about 10% of the processing time compared to the DM. Thus VALDIA can control between 5 and 10 instances of the DM depending on available resources in the net. VALDIA is platform independent. At our site, we are using a mixture of different types of computers, both PCs running under Windows/Linux and UNIX machines. Depending on load, we are flexible to utilize any of the free resources for the testing.","We are currently in the process of adapting VALDIA for a new scenario. For this DM input consists of grammatical structures, rather than sets of semantic objects. Since the VALDIA project started, interesting research results have emerged and there are lot of things that remain to be done. Amongst those, we will pay attention to at least the following topics: The current implementation of VALDIA has no means of react on the output from the DM. For intelligent testing this has to be incorporated into the system. Possible future directions are described in (Eckert et al., 1998), (Schefiler and Young, 2000) and (Lin and Lee, 2000).
