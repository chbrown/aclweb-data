We formalize it as the problem of combining the outcomes of several different classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints, and develop two general approaches for it. The first is a Markovian approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observations structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We also develop efficient algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing. 1 1 Identifying Phrase Structure The problem of identifying phrase structure can be formalized as follows. Given an input string O =< ol, 02,..., On >, a phrase is a substring of consecutive input symbols oi, oi+l,...,oj. Some external mechanism is assumed to consistently (or stochastically) annotate substrings as phrases 2. Our goal is to come up with a mechanism that, given an input string, identifies the phrases in this string, this is a fundamental task with applications in natural language (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Mufioz et al., 1999; Cardie and Pierce, 1998).","The identification mechanism works by using classifiers that process the input string and recognize in the input string local signals which * This research is supported by NSF grants IIS-9801638, SBR-9873450 and IIS-9984168.","1Full version is in (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000).","2We assume here a single type of phrase, and thus each input symbol is either in a phrase or outside it. All the methods we discuss can be extended to deal with several kinds of phrases in a string, including different kinds of phrases and embedded phrases. are indicative to the existence of a phrase. Local signals can indicate that an input symbol o is inside or outside a phrase (IO modeling) or they can indicate that an input symbol o opens or closes a phrase (the OC modeling) or some combination of the two. In any case, the local signals can be combined to determine the phrases in the input string. This process, however, needs to satisfy some constraints for the resulting set of phrases to be legitimate. Several types of constraints, such as length and order can be formalized and incorporated into the mechanisms studied here. For simplicity, we focus only on the most basic and common constraint - we assume that phrases do not overlap.","The goal is thus two-fold: to learn classifiers that recognize the local signals and to combine these in a ways that respects the constraints. 2 Markov Modeling HMM is a probabilistic finite state automaton used to model the probabilistic generation of sequential processes. The model consists of a finite set S of states, a set (9 of observations, an initial state distribution P1 (s), a state-transition distribution P(s[s') for s, # E S and an observation distribution P(o[s) for o E (9 and s 6 S. 3","In a supervised learning task, an observation sequence O --< ol,o2,... On > is supervised by a corresponding state sequence S =< sl, s2,. • • sn >. The supervision can also be supplied, as described in Sec. 1, using the local signals. Constraints can be incorporated into the HMM by constraining the state transition probability distribution P(s]s'). For example, set P(sV) = 0 for all s, s' such that the transition from s ~ to s is not allowed. aSee (Rabiner, 1989) for a comprehensive tutorial. 107","Combining HMM and classifiers (artificial neural networks) has been exploited in speech recognition (Morgan and Bourlard, 1995), however, with some differences from this work. 2.1 HMM with Classifiers To recover the most likely state sequence in HMM, we wish to estimate all the required probability distributions.

Therefore, to compute the most likely sequence, standard dynamic programming (Viterbi) can still be applied. 2.2 Projection based Markov Model In HMMs, observations are allowed to depend only on the current state and long term dependencies are not modeled. Equivalently, from the constraint point of view, the constraint structure is restricted by having a stationary probability distribution of a state given the previous one. We attempt to relax this by allowing the distribution of a state to depend, in addition to the previous state, on the observation.

For technical reasons it is easier to keep track of the constraints if the cases --1 o and --1 c are separated according to whether we are inside or outside a phrase. Consequently, each classifier may output three possible outcomes O, nOi, nOo (open, not open inside, not open outside) and C, nCi, nCo, resp. The state-transition diagram in figure 1 captures the order constraints. Our modeling of the problem is a modification of our earlier work on this topic that has been found to be quite successful compared to other learning methods attempted on this problem (Mufioz et al., 1999) and in particular, better than the IO modeling of the problem (Mufioz et al., 1999). Figure 1: State-transition diagramfor the phrase recognition problem.","The classifier we use to learn the states as a function of the observations is SNoW (Roth, 1998; Carleson et al., 1999), a multi-class classifter that is specifically tailored for large scale learning tasks. The SNoW learning architecture learns a sparse network of linear functions, in which the targets (states, in this case) are represented as linear functions over a common feature space. Typically, SNoW is used as a classifier, and predicts using a winner-take-all","4Another solution in which the classifiers' suggestions inside each phrase axe also accounted for is possible. mechanism over the activation value of the taxget classes in this case. The activation value itself is computed using a sigmoid function over the linear sum.

The data sets used are the standard data sets for this problem (Ramshaw and Maxcus, 1995; Argamon et al., 1999; Mufioz et al., 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) taken from the Wall Street Journal corpus in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).","For each model we study three different classifiers.

The NB (naive Bayes) and SNoW classifiers use the same feature set, conjunctions of size 3 of POS tags (+ words) in a window of size 6 around the target word.","The first important observation is that the SV task is significantly more difficult than the NP task. This is consistent for all models and all features sets. When comparing between different models and features sets, it is clear that the simple HMM formalism is not competitive with the other two models. What is interesting here is the very significant sensitivity to the wider notion of observations (features) used by the classifiers, despite the violation of the probabilistic assumptions. For the easier NP task, the HMM model is competitive with the others when the classifiers used are NB or SNOW. In particular, a significant improvement in both probabilistic methods is achieved when their input is given by SNOW.","Our two main methods, PMM and CSCL, perform very well on predicting NP and SV phrases with CSCL at least as good as any other methods tried on these tasks.

We attribute it to CSCL's ability to cope better with the length of the phrase and the long term dependencies.","Our methods compare favorably with others with the exception to SV in (Mufioz et al., 1999). Their method is fundamentally similar to our CSCL; however, they incorporated the features from open in the close classifier allowing to exploit the dependencies between two classifiers. We believe that this is the main factor of the significant difference in performance. 6 Conclusion We have addressed the problem of combining the outcomes of several different classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints, While the probabilistic approach extends standard and commonly used techniques for sequential decisions, it seems that the constraint satisfaction formalisms can support complex constraints and dependencies more flexibly. Future work will concentrate on these formalisms.","References","S. Argamon, I. Dagan, and Y. Krymolowski. 1999. A memory-based approach to learning shallow natural language patterns.
