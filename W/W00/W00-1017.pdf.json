One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.","To this end, several toolkits for building spoken dialogue systems have been developed (Barnett and Singh, 1997; Sasajima et al., 1999). One is the CSLU Toolkit (Sutton et al., 1998), which enables rapid prototyping of a spoken dialogue system that incorporates a finite-state dialogue model. It decreases the amount of the effort required in building a spoken dialogue system in a user-defined task domain. However, it limits system functions; it is not easy to employ the advanced language processing techniques developed in the realm of computational linguistics. Another is GALAXY-II (Seneffet al., 1998),","*Mikio Nakano is currently a visiting scientist at MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. which enables modules in a dialogue system to communicate with each other. It consists of the hub and several servers, such as the speech recognition server and the natural language server, and the hub communicates with these servers. Although it requires more specifications than finite-state-model-based toolkits, it places less limitations on system functions.","Our objective is to build robust and real-time spoken dialogue systems in different task do-mains. By robust we mean utterance understanding is robust enough to capture not only utterances including grammatical errors or self-repairs but also utterances that are not clearly segmented into sentences by pauses. Real time means the system can respond to the user in real time. The reason we focus on these features is that they are crucial to the usability of spoken dialogue systems as well as to the accuracy of understanding and appropriateness of the content of the system utterance. Robust understanding allows the user to speak to the system in an unrestricted way. Responding in real time is important because if a system response is delayed, the user might think that his/her utterance was not recognized by the system and make another utterance, making the dialogue disorderly. Systems having these features should have several modules that work in parallel, and each module needs some domain-dependent knowledge sources. Creat-ing and maintaining these knowledge sources require much effort, thus a toolkit would be helpful. Previous toolkits, however, do not allow us to achieve these features, or do not provide mechanisms that achieve these features without requir-ing excessive efforts by the developers.","This paper presents WIT 1, which is a toolkit IWIT is an acronym of Workable spoken dialogue lnter-150 for building spoken dialogue systems that integrate speech recognition, language understanding and generation, and speech output. WIT features an incremental understanding method (Nakano et al., 1999b) that makes it possible to build a robust and real-time system. In addition, WIT compiles domain-dependent system specifications into internal knowledge sources so that building systems is easier. Although WIT requires more domain-dependent specifications than finite-state-model-based toolkits, WIT-based systems are capable of taking full advantage of language processing technology. WIT has been implemented and used to build several spoken dialogue systems.","In what follows, we overview WIT, explain its architecture, domain-dependent system specifications, and implementation, and then discuss its advantages and problems."]},{"title":"2 Overview","paragraphs":["A WIT-based spoken dialogue system has four main modules: the"]},{"title":"speech recognition module, the language understanding module, the language generation module, and the speech output module.","paragraphs":["These modules exploit domain-dependent knowledge sources, which are automatically generated from the domain-dependent system specifications.

As the recogn/fion engine, either VoiceRex, developed by NTI\" (Noda et al., 1998), or HTK from Entropic Research can be used. Acoustic models for HTK is trained with the continuous speech database of the Acoustical Society of Japan (Kobayashi et al., 1992). This recognizer incrementally outputs word hypotheses as soon as they are found in the best-scored path in the forward search (Hirasawa et al., 1998) using the ISTAR (Incremental Structure Transmitter And Receiver) protocol, which conveys word graph information as well as word hypotheses. This incremental output allows the language understanding module to process recognition results before the speech interval ends, and thus real-time responses are possible. This module continuously runs and outputs recognition results when it detects a speech interval. This enables the language generation module to react immediately to user interruptions while the system is speaking.","The language model for speech recognition is a network (regular) grammar, and it allows each speech interval to be an arbitrary number of"]},{"title":"phrases.","paragraphs":["A phrase is a sequence of words, which is to be defined in a domain-dependent way. Sentences can be decomposed into a couple of phrases.

The understanding module utilizes ISSS (Incremental Significant-utterance Sequence Search) (Nakano et al., 1999b), which is an integrated parsing and discourse processing method. ISSS enables the incremental understanding of user utterances that are not segmented into sentences prior to parsing by incrementally finding the most plausible sequence of sentences (or significant utterances in the ISSS terms) out of the possible sentence sequences for the input word sequence. ISSS also makes it possible for the language generation module to respond in real time because it can output a partial result of understanding at any point in time.","The domain-dependent knowledge used in this module consists of a unification-based lexicon and phrase structure rules. Disjunctive feature descriptions are also possible; WIT incorporates an efficient method for handling disjunctions (Nakano, 1991). When a phrase boundary is detected, the feature structure for a phrase is computed using some built-in rules from the feature structure rules for the words in the phrase. The phrase structure rules specify what kind of phrase sequences can be considered as sentences, and they also enable computing the semantic representation for found sentences. Two kinds of sentenees can be considered; domain-related ones that express the user's intention about the reser-152 vafion and dialogue-related ones that express the user's attitude with respect to the progress of the dialogue, such as confirmation and denial. Considering the meeting room reservation system, examples of domain-related sentences are \"I need to book Room 2 on Wednesday\", \"I need to book Room 2\", and \"Room 2\" and dialogue-related ones are \"yes\", \"no\", and \"Okay\".","The semantic representation for a sentence is a command for updatingthe dialogue state. The dialogue state is represented by a list of attribute-value pairs. For example, attributes used in the meeting room reservation system include task-related attributes, such as the date and time of the reservation, as well as attributes that represent discourse-related information, such as confirmation and grounding."]},{"title":"3.3 Language Generation","paragraphs":["How the language generation module works varies depending on whether the user or system has the initiative of turn taking in the dialogue 2. Precisely speaking, the participant having the initiative is the one the system assumes has it in the dialogue.","The domain-dependent knowledge used by the language generation module is generation procedures, which consist of a set of dialogue-phase definitions. For each dialogue phase, an initial function, an action function, a time-out function, and a language model are assigned. In addition, phase definitions designate whether the user or the system has the initiative. In the phases in which the system has the initiative, only the initial function and the language model are assigned. The meeting room reservation system, for example, has three phases: the phase in which the user tells the system his/her request, the phase in which the system confirms it, and the phase in which the system tells the user the result of the database access. In the first two phases, the user holds the initiative, and in the last phase, the systern holds the initiative.","Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state. They can also shift the dialogue","2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of Chu-Carroll (2000). phase and change the holder of the initiative as well as change the dialogue state. When the dialogue phase shifts, the language model foi\" speech recognition is changed to get better speech recognition performance. Typically, the language generation module is responsible for database access.","The language generation module works as follows. It first checks which dialogue participant has the initiative. If the initiative is held by the user, it waits until the user's speech interval ends or a duration of silence after the end of a system utterance is detected. The action function in the dialogue phase at that point in time is executed in the former case; the time-out function is executed in the latter case. Then it goes back to the initial stage. If the system holds the initiative, the module executes the initial function of the phase. In typical question-answer systems, the user has the initiative when asking questions and the system has it when answering.","Since the language generation module works in parallel with the language understanding module, utterance generation is possible even while the system is listening to user utterances and that utterance understanding is possible even while it is speaking (Nakano et al., 1999a). Thus the system can respond immediately after user pauses when the user has the initiative. When the system holds the initiative, it can immediately react to an in-terruption by the user because user utterances are understood in an incremental way (Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1997).","The time-out function is effective in moving the dialogue forward when the dialogue gets stuck for some reason. For example, the system may be able to repeat the same question with another expression and may also be able to ask the user a more specific question."]},{"title":"3.4 Speech Output","paragraphs":["The speech output module produces speech according to the requests from the language generation module by using the correspondence table between strings and pre-recorded speech data. It also notifies the language generation module that speech output has finished so that the language generation module can take into account the tim-ing of the end of system utterance. The meeting room reservation system uses speech files of short 153 phrases."]},{"title":"4 Building Spoken Dialo~te Systems","paragraphs":["with WIT"]},{"title":"4.1 Domain-Dependent System Specifications","paragraphs":["Spoken dialogue systems can be built with WIT by preparing several domain-dependent specifications.

They also specify whether each feature is a head feature or a foot feature (Pollard and Sag, 1994). This information is used when constructing feature structures for phrases in a built-in process.","The following is an example of a feature definition. Here we use examples from the specification of the meeting room reservation system.

In the example below, month-phrase is the phrase category name and the remaining part is the network of word categories. opt means an option and or means a disjunction. For instance, a word sequence that consists of a word in the month category, such as 1-gatsu (January), and a word in the adraoninalparticle category, such as no (of), forms a phrase in the month-phrase category.","3In this section, we use examples of different description from the actual ones for simplicity.

Semantic-frame specifications define the attributes used in the frame. The meeting room reservation system uses task-related attributes. Two are start and"]},{"title":"end,","paragraphs":["which represent the user's intention about the start and end times of the reservation for some meeting room. It also has attributes that represent discourse information. One is confirmed, whose value indicates whether if the system has already made an utterance to confirm the content of the task-related attributes."]},{"title":"Rule Definitions:","paragraphs":["Each rule has one of the following two forms. ((rule name) (child feature structure)","•.. (child feature structure) => (mother feature structu_e)","(priority increase) ) ((role name) (child feature structure)","•.. (child feature structure) => (flame operation command)","(priority increase) ) These roles are similar to DCG (Pereira and Warren, 1980) rules; they can include logical variables and these variables can be bound when these rules are applied. It is possible to add to the rules constraints that stipulate relationships that must hold among variables (Nakano, 199 I), but we do not explain these constraints in detail in this 154 paper. The priorities are used for disambiguat-ing interpretation in the incremental understanding method (Nakano et al., 1999b).","When the command on the right-hand side of the arrow is a frame operation command, phrases to which this rule can be applied can be considered a sentence, and the sentence's semantic representation is the command for updating the dialogue state. The command is one of the following:","• A command to set the value of an attribute of the frame, • A command to increase the priority, Conditional commands (If-then-else type command, the condition being whether the value of an attribute of the flame is or is not equal to a specified value, or a conjunction or disjunction of the above condition), or","• A list of commands to be sequentially executed. Thanks to conditional commands, it is possible to represent the semantics of sentences contextdependently.","The following rule is an example. (start-end-times-command (time-phrase :from *start) (time-phrase (:or :to nil) *end) => (command (set :start *start)","(set :end *end))) The name of this rule is start-end-times-command. The second and third elements are child feature structures. In these elements, time-phrase is a phrase category, : from and ( : or : to nil ) are case feature values, and *start and *end are semantic feature values. Here :or means a disjunction, and symbols starting with an asterisk are variables. The right-hand side of the arrow is a command to update the frame. The second element of the command, (set :start *start), changes the :start atttribute value of the frame to the in-stance of *start, which should be bound when applying this rule to the child feature structures. Phase Definitions: Each phase definition consists of a phase name, a network name, an initiative holder specification, an initial function, an action function, a maximum silence duration, and a time-out function. The network name is the identifier of the language model for the speech recognition. The maximum silence duration specifies how long the generation module should wait until the time-out function is invoked.","Below is an example of a phase definition. The first element request is the name of this phase, \"frar_request\" is the name of the network, and move-to-reques t-phase and request-phase-action are the names of the initial and action functions. In this phase, the maximum silence duration is ten seconds and the name of the time-out function is request-phas e- t imeou t.","(request \"fmr_request\" move- to-reques t -phase request-phase-action 10.0 request-phase- t imeout ) For the definitions of these functions, WIT provides functions for accessing the dialogue state, sending a request to speak to the speech output module, generating strings to be spoken using surface generation templates, shifting the dialogue phase, taking and releasing the initiative, and so on. Functions are defined in terms of the Common Lisp program. Surface-generation Templates: Surface-generation templates are used by the surface generation library function, which converts a list-structured semantic representation to a sequence of strings. Each string can be spoken, i.e., it is in the list of pre-recorded speech files.","For example, let us consider the conversion of the semantic representation (date (date-expression 3 15) ) to strings using the following template. ( (date (date-expression *month *day)) ( (*month gatsu) (*day nichi) ) ) The surface generation library function matches the input semantic representation with the first element of the template and checks if a sequences 155 of strings appear in the speech file list. It returns (' '3gagsul5nichi'') (March 15th) if the string \"3gatsul5nichi\" is in the list of pre-recorded speech files, and otherwise, returns ( ' ' 3gatsu .... 15nichi' ' ) when these strings are in the list."]},{"title":"List of Pre-recorded","paragraphs":["Speech Files: The list of pre-recorded speech files should show the correspondence between strings and speech files to be played by the speech output module."]},{"title":"4.2 Compiling System Specifications","paragraphs":["From the specifications explained above, domain-dependent knowledge sources are created as indicated by the dashed arrows in Figure 1. When creating the knowledge sources, WIT checks for several kinds of consistency. For example, the set of word categories appearing in the lexicon and the set of word categories appearing in phrase deftnifions are compared. This makes it easy to find errors in the domain specifications."]},{"title":"5 Implementation","paragraphs":["WIT has been implemented in Common Lisp and C on UNIX, and we have built several experimental and demonstration dialogue systems using it, including a meeting room reservation system (Nakano et al., 1999b), a video-recording programming system, a schedule management system (Nakano et al., 1999a), and a weather information system (Dohsaka et al., 2000). The meeting room reservation system has vocabulary of about 140 words, around 40 phrase structure rules, nine attributes in the semantic frame, and around 100 speech files. A sample dialogue between this system and a naive user is shown in Figure 2. This system employs HTK as the speech recognition engine. The weather information system can answer the user's questions about weather forecasts in Japan. The vocabulary size is around 500, and the number of phrase structure rules is 31. The number of attributes in the semantic flame is 11, and the number of the files of the pre-recorded speech is about 13,000."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["As explained above, the architecture of WIT allows us to develop a system that can use utterances that are not clearly segmented into sentences by pauses and respond in real time. Below we discuss other advantages and remaining problems."]},{"title":"6.1 Descriptive Power","paragraphs":["Whereas previous finite-state-model-based toolkits place many severe restrictions on domain descriptions, WIT has enough descriptive power to build a variety of dialogue systems. Although the dialogue state is represented by a simple attribute-value matrix, since there is no limitation on the number of attributes, it can hold more complicated information. For example, it is possible to represent a discourse stack whose depth is limited. Recording some dialogue history is also possible. Since the language understanding module utilizes unification, a wide variety of linguistic phenomena can be covered. For example, speech repairs, particle omission, and fillers can be dealt with in the framework of unifica-tion grammar (Nakano et al., 1994; Nakano and Shimazu, 1999). The language generation module features Common Lisp functions, so there is no limitation on the description. Some of the systems we have developed feature a generation method based on hierarchical planning (Dohsaka and Shirnazu, 1997). It is also possible to build a simple finite-state-model-based dialogue system using WIT. States can be represented by dialogue phases in WIT."]},{"title":"6.2 Consistency","paragraphs":["In an agglutinative language such as Japanese, there is no established definition of words, so dialogue system developers must define words. This sometimes causes a problem in that the definition of word, that is, the word boundaries, in the speech recognition module are different from that in the language understanding module. In WIT, however, since the common lexicon is used in both the speech recognition module and language understanding module, the consistency between them is maintained."]},{"title":"6-3 Avoiding Information Loss","paragraphs":["In ordinary spoken language systems, the speech recognition module sends just a word hypothesis to the language processing module, which 156 speaker start end utterance","time (s) time (s) system: 614.53 615.93 user: 616.38 618.29 system: 619.97 620.13 user: 622.65 624.08 system: 625.68 625.91 user: 626.65 627.78 system: 629.25 629.55 user: 629.91 631.67 system: 633.29 633.57 user: 634.95 636.00 system: 637.50 645.43 user: 645.74 646.04 system: 647.05 648.20 Figure 2:"]},{"title":"donoy6na goy6ken desh6 ka","paragraphs":["(how may I help you?)"]},{"title":"kaigishitsu o yoyaku shitai ndesu ga","paragraphs":["(I'd like to make a reservation for a meeting room)"]},{"title":"hai","paragraphs":["(uh-huh)"]},{"title":"san-gatsujfini-nichi","paragraphs":["(on March 12th)"]},{"title":"hal","paragraphs":["(uh-huh)"]},{"title":"jayo-ji kara","paragraphs":["(from 14:00)"]},{"title":"hai","paragraphs":["(uh-huh)"]},{"title":"jashichi-ji sanjup-pun made","paragraphs":["(to 17:30)"]},{"title":"hai","paragraphs":["(uh-huh)"]},{"title":"dai-kaigishitsu","paragraphs":["(the large meeting room)"]},{"title":"san-gatsu jani-nichi, j~yo-ji kara, jashichi-ji sanjup-pun made, dai-kaigishitsu toyfi koto de yoroshf deshrka","paragraphs":["(on March 12th, from 14:00 to 17:30, the large meeting room, is that right?) \""]},{"title":"hai","paragraphs":["(yes)"]},{"title":"kashikomarimashitd","paragraphs":["(all right) An example dialogue of an example system must disambiguate word meaning and find phrase boundaries by parsing.

This leads to less expensive and better language understanding. 6.4 Problems and Limitations Several problems remain with WIT. One of the most significant is that the system developer must write language generation functions. If the generation functions employ sophisticated dialogue strategies, the system can perform complicated dialogues that are not just question answering. WIT, however, does not provide task-independent facilities that make it easier to employ such dialogue strategies.","There have been several efforts aimed at developing a domain-independent method for generating responses from a frame representation of user requests (Bobrow et al., 1977; Chu-CarroU, 1999). Incorporating such techniques would deo crease the system developer workload. However, there has been no work on domain-independent response generation for robust spoken dialogue systems that can deal with utterances that might include pauses in the middle of a sentence, which WIT handles well. Therefore incorporating those techniques remains as a future work.","Another limitation is that WIT cannot deal with multiple speech recognition candidates such as those in an N-best list. Extending WIT to deal with multiple recognition results would improve the performance of the whole system. The ISSS preference mechanism is expected to play a role in choosing the best recognition result. 7 Conclusion This paper described WIT, a toolkit for building spoken dialogue systems. Although it requires more system specifications than previous finite-state-model-based toolkits, it enables one to easily construct real-time, robust spoken dialogue systems that incorporates advanced computational linguistics technologies.
