Neurological data from patients with acquired dyslexias have been highlighted to support this claim. Models using a lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable of explaining these data. However, by selectively impairing its component parts, it is easily possible to account for phonological and surface dyslexias using a single-route model based upon pronunciation by analogy. 1 Introduction We have previously developed pronunciation by analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and as a method for automatic phonemisation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper, 1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand and Damper, 2000). We have also demonstrated (Damper et al., 1999) that the performance of PbA in producing correct pronunciations is vastly superior to manually-written rules and significantly better than the competitor data-driven techniques of back-propagation (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; McCulloch et al., 1987) and the IBloIG method based on information gain weighting (Daelemans et al., 1997). Although we cannot claim that PbA is absolutely the best method for pronunciation generation, it must be taken seriously. This view is clearly shared by other workers who are actively developing analogical methods for natural language processing tasks (Pirrelli and Federici, 1995; Jones, 1996; Yvon, 1996; 1997; Bagshaw, 1998; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999).","Explicit analogy (e.g., Dedina and Nusbaum, 1991; Damper and Eastmond, 1997) retains the lexicon in its entirety, typically as a list of words and their spellings. PbA requires a dictionary in which text and phonemics have been aligned, so that pronunciations corresponding to matching orthographic substrings can be identified. However, many of the necessary computational steps to assemble a pronunciation can be carried out in advance. Thus, in implicit analogy (e.g., Sullivan and Damper, 1993), the lexical database is precompiled to yield a generalised phonological knowledge base which is consulted during pronunciation generation. This done, the (explicit) dictionary can be discarded. Implicit analogy may also attempt to compress the training data, so that some proportion is discarded.","Here, we extend earlier work on modelling pronunciation by normal readers to impaired readers with acquired dyslexias. There are several forms of this: two of the most important are"]},{"title":"phonological","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"surface","paragraphs":["dyslexia. Cases of phonological dyslexia display good ability to read words (both regular and irregularlyspelled) aloud but poor nonword reading ability (Beauvois and D~rouesn~, 1979). In surface dyslexia, however, patients misread irregularly spelled words, which tend to be regularised in their pronunciation (Coltheart et al., 1983). To simulate these dyslexias, we use explicit PbA without compression. The approach is to damage the model and then to observe its ability to replicate the neuropsychological data. 2 Dual and Single Routes to Sound The nature of the cognitive processes underly-ing the act of reading aloud has spawned an important and controversial debate in psychology (Humphreys and Evett, 1985; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Coltheart et al., 1993; Plaut et al., 1996). One popular view is that there are 13 two routes from print to sound: a texical and a nonlexical route (Coltheart, 1978). The former involves access to lexical knowledge for familiar words. The second route concerns the pronunciation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable nonwords and is thought to operate on the basis of a set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules. The strong version of this dual-route theory claims that nonwords are segmented at the level of the grapheme and that the pronunciation of nonwords is not influenced by lexical information. A line of evidence generally held to support the model comes from neuropsychological studies of acquired dyslexia. For instance, the patient WB studied by Funnell (1983) is considered a particularly pure case of phonological dyslexia with good reading of words and poor reading of nonwords. This case appears to conform to one of the main predictions of dual-route theory: namely, that neurological damage could selectively impair either processing route, so that a patient may have impaired processing in one system but intact processing in the other.","Nonetheless, the dual-route model has been criticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980; Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shallice et al., 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985; McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who emphasise that nonword pronunciation can be subject to lexical influences and/or argue for \"multiple levels\" of processing. Two main alternatives have been proposed to counter these objections: a single-route framework and a modified dual-route model. The first claims that all print-to-sound conversion is realised through a lexical route. That is, oral reading involves processes that all operate on a lexical database so that words and nonwords can be produced by the same mechanism. However, there has some-times been a lack of clarity in defining such a single-route mechanism. Often, some kind of analogy process is posited, but its precise form has rarely been specified. Hence, informed commentators have most often been inclined to re-form and repair the dual-route theory by relaxing its strong assumptions, either to allow an interaction between routes (Reggia et al., 1988) or to extend the notion of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (Patterson and Morton, 1985) by introducing the notion of body-- the vowel-plus-terminal-consonant segment of monosyllabic words.","The dual-route model has been more recently questioned by a plethora of single-route computational models based on connectionist principles (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Hinton and Shallice, 1991; Plaut et al., 1996; Bullinaria, 1997; Ans et al., 1998; Zorzi et al., 1998). Less often has analogy been used as the basis of a single-route model. The idea that pseudowords can be pronounced by analogy with lexical words that they resemble has a long history (Baron, 1977; Brooks, 1977; Glushko, 1979). In place of abstract letter-to-sound rules in dual-route models we have specific patterns of correspondence in single-route analogy models. 3 Implementing PbA In PbA, an unknown word is pronounced by matching substrings of the input to substrings of known, lexical words, hypothesizing a partial pronunciation for each matched substring from the phonological knowledge, and assembling the partial pronunciations. Here, we use an extended and improved version of the system described by Dedina and Nusbaum (1991), which consists of four components: the (uncompressed and previously aligned) lexical database, the matcher which compares the target input to all the words in the database, the pronunciation lattice (a data structure representing possible pronunciations), and the decision func-tion, which selects the 'best' pronunciation among the set of possible ones. The lexicon used is Webster's Pocket Dictionary, containing 20,009 words manually aligned by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1987) for training their NETtalk neural network. Pattern Matching: An incoming word is matched in turn against all orthographic entries in the lexicon. For a given entry, assume the process starts with the input string and the dictionary entry left-aligned. Substrings sharing contiguous, common letters in matching positions are then found. Information about these matching letter substrings and their corresponding, aligned phoneme substrings in the dictionary entry under consideration is entered into a pronunciation lattice--see below. One of the two strings is then shifted right by one letter and the matching process repeated, until 14 some termination condition is met. This process can be alternatively seen as a matching between substrings of the incoming word, segmented in all possible ways, and the dictionary entries. Pronunciation Lattice: A node of the lattice represents a matched letter,"]},{"title":"Li,","paragraphs":["at some position,"]},{"title":"i,","paragraphs":["in the input.

Additionally, arcs are labelled with a 'frequency' count which is incremented each time that substring (with that pronunciation) is matched during the pass through the lexicon.

(Different paths can, of course, correspond to the same pronunciation.) Scoring of candidate pronunciation uses two heuristics. If there is a unique shortest path, then the corresponding pronunciation is taken as the output. If there are tied shortest paths, then the pronunciation corresponding to the best scoring of these is taken as the output.","This also offers a way of simulating the 'word segmentation' test of Funnell (1983), in which patients have to find words 'hidden' in letter strings. First, there is an initial segmentation in which the input string is segmented in all possible ways, as in 'regular' PbA. Then, if any of these substrings produces a lattice with a length-1 arc, this identifies a lexical word. A single-route connectionist model or abstract rules (or, for that matter, implicit PbA) can not do this without some extension to maintain explicit knowledge of lexical status. Of course, it is possible that a patient can perform the first of these steps, but not the second. This is the difference between our 'unconscious' and 'conscious' segmentations (see below) so-called be-cause, in the latter, the patient is aware that he/she has to find a hidden word.","This particular implementation of PbA does not guarantee an output pronunciation. A complete path through the lattice requires that all nodes on that path (except the first and last) are linked by at least one arc. Clearly, each arc must have a node at either end. Although an arc may have an empty label, a node cannot. Hence, the minimum matching segment length corresponds to a letter bigram. It may be that no matching bigram exists in some cases. So there with be no complete path through the lattice and no pronunciation can be inferred--the 'silence problem'. Recent Improvements: The implementation used here features several enhancements over the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&N) system (Marchand and Damper, 2000). First, we use 'full' pattern matching between input letter string and dictionary entries, as opposed to the 'partial' matching of D&N. That is, rather than starting with the two strings left-aligned, we start with the initial letter of the input string Z aligned with the last letter of the dictionary entry YV. The matching process terminates not when the two strings are right-aligned, but when the last letter of Z aligns with initial letter of ]/Y. Second, multiple (five) heuristics are used to score the candidate pronunciations. Individual scores are then multiplied together to produce a final overall score. The best-scoring pronunciation is then selected as output. Marchand and Damper show that this 'multi-strategy' approach gives statistically significant performance improvements over simpler versions of PbA. 4 Modelling Phonological Dyslexia By selective impairment of component parts of the PbA model, we have simulated reading data from the two phonological dyslexic patients (WB and FL) studied by Funnell (1983). (The reader is referred to this original source for specifications of the tests and materials.) While the first of these patients has often been cited as a key individual strongly supporting dual-route theory, we believe that FL (who has been largely ignored) is actually a counter-example. FL was unable to supply a sound for single letters (which argues that the abstract rule-based route is impaired) although she could read non-words normally (which contradicts the 15 Table 1: Reading performance of patient WB and versions of faulty and non-faulty PbA.

Version 1 supposes that brain damage has induced a partial loss of words from his mental lexicon (the 15% that he can not read aloud) and a total breakdown of his concatenation mechanism. Version 2 supposes that WB's impairment results from injury to one component only; namely, the process of segmentation into all possible substrings is partially damaged. In Version 2, we stress the distinction made earlier between this basic"]},{"title":"(unconscious)","paragraphs":["segmentation process and Funnell's"]},{"title":"(conscious)","paragraphs":["segmentation. The unconscious segmentation is that embodied in the PbA pattern matching when WB is asked to read some string. For this specific patient, we postulate damage to the segmentation component such that it can only process substrings of length between 5 and 7. The conscious segmentation is that used when WB is asked to find words within strings and to read them aloud. This process is assumed to be fully operational. For patient FL, a single 'faulty' version of PbA has been developed which postulates a deftciency of (unconscious) segmentation such that substrings of length less than three cannot be used in pattern matching.","Table 1 shows reading accuracy for patient WB for the various tests performed by Funnell together with the corresponding results of simulations of impaired and non-faulty PbA. Table 2 shows the results for patient FL reading aloud and the corresponding simulation of faulty and non-faulty PbA. Evidently, it is possible to reproduce quite well both patients' symptoms. Indeed, with Version 1, we can in-terpret WB's condition very directly: The concatenation process involved in nonword reading is completely destroyed but the mental lexicon is relatively spared.

KT was able to pronounce regular words and nonwords very well but had serious difficulty in reading irregular words, tending to produce regularisation errors. (Again, limitations of space mean we must refer the reader to the original source for details of the reading tests and materials.) Together with WB, these patients have been taken as almost an existence proof of dual routes which can be differentially damaged.","We suppose that KT's impairment results from injury to two components of the PbA model. First, as in phonological dyslexia, we assume that the process of segmentation into all possible substrings is partially damaged. More specifically, we postulate a deficiency concerning the size of the window involved in the pattern matching. Second, it is assumed that one or several (of the total of five) multi-strategies may be degraded.","The simulations were obtained for a model with damage in the third and fourth multi-strategies (see Marchand and Damper, 2000, for detailed specification) and only substrings of length between 2 and 4 can be segmented in pattern matching. Table 3 shows KT's mean reading accuracy over the various tests performed by McCarthy and Warrington together with our corresponding simulation results for impaired and non-faulty PbA. Clearly, it is possible to reproduce quite well the patient's cardinal symptoms: his ability to pronounce regular words much better than irregular ones. The incorrect pronunciations show a clear regularisation effect (not detailed here). 6"]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["Contrary to the claims of dual-route theorists, a single-route PbA model of reading is indeed able to explain both phonological and surface dyslexia, on the basis of selective impairment of its component parts."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["B.
