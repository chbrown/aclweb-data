An XML document is a mixture of structure (the tags) and surface (text between the tags). The structure reflects the choices made by the author during the top-down stepwise refinement of the document under control of a DTD grammar. These choices are typically choices of meaning which are independent of the language in which the document is rendered, and can be seen as a kind of interlingua for the class of documents which is modeled by the DTD. Based on this remark, we advocate a radicalization of XML authoring, where the semantic content of the document is accounted for exclusively in terms of choice structures, and where appropriate rendering/realization mechanisms are responsible for producing the surface, possibly in several languages simultaneously. In this view, XML authoring has strong connections to natural language generation and text authoring. We describe the IG (Interaction Grammar) formalism, an extension of DTD's which permits powerful linguistic manipulations, and show its application to the production of multilingual versions of a certain class of pharmaceutical documents. 1 Introduction The world of technical documentation is forcefully moving towards the use of authoring tools based on the XML markup language (W3C, 1998; Pardi, 1999). This language is based on grammatical specifications, called DTD's, which are roughly similar to context-free grammars 1 with an arbitrary number of non-terminals and exactly one predefined terminal called pcdata. The pcdata terminal has a special status: it can dominate any character st, ring (subject to certain restrictions on the characters allowed). Authoring is seen as a. top-down interactive process of step-wise refinement of the root nonterminal (corresponding to the whole document) where the author iteratively selects a rule for expanding a","lBut see (Wood, 1995: Prescod, 1998) for discussions of the differences. nonterminal already present in the tree and where in addition s/he can choose an arbitrary sequence of characters (roughly) for expanding tile pcdata node. The resulting document is a mixture of tree-like structure (the context-free derivation tree corresponding to the author's selections), represented through tags, and of surface, represented as free-text (PCDATA) between the tags.","We see however a tension between the structure and surface aspects of an XML document:","® While structural choices are under system control (they have to be compatible with the DTD), surface choices are not. 2","• Surface strings are treated as unanalysable chunks for the styling mechanisms that render the XML document to the reader. They can be displayed in a given font or moved around, but they lack the internal structure that would permit to \"re-purpose\" them for different rendering situations, such as displaying on mobile telephone screens, wording differently for a specific audience, or producing prosodically adequate phonetic output. This situation stands in contrast with the underlying philosophy of XML, which emphasizes the separation between content specification and the multiple situations in which this content can be exploited.",". Structural decisions tend t,o be associated wit, h choices of meaning which are independent of the language in which the document is rendered. Thus for instance the DTD for an aircraft main-tenance manual might distinguish between two kinds of risks: caution (material damage risk) and warning (risk to the operator). By selecting one of these options (a choice that will lead t,o further-t_owerdevel choices,), the::author takes a decision of a semantic nature, which is quite independent of the language in which the document is to be rendered, and which could be exploited to produce multilingual versions of the","2With the emergenceof schemas (W3C, 1999a), which permit some typing of the surface (float, boolean, string, etc.), some degree of control is becoming more feasible. 24 document. By contrast, a PCDATA string is language-specific.and ill-suited for multilingual applications.","These remarks point to a possible radical view of XML authoring that advocates that surface strings be altogether eliminated from the document content, and that author choices be all under the explicit control of the DTD and reflected in the document structure. Such a view, which is argued for in a related paper (Dymetman et el., 2000), emphasizes the link application of MDA to a certain domain of pharmaceutical documents."]},{"title":"2 Our approach to Multilingual Document Authoring","paragraphs":["Our Multilingual Document Authoring system has","the following main features:","First, the authoring process is monolingual, but","the results are multilingual.

This structure of choices is represented in a choice tree, which is viewed as the semantic representation for the document. 4 One single choice may be associated with text realizations of drastically different granularities: while in a pharmaceutical document the choice of an ingredient may result in the production of a single word, the choice of a \"responsabilitywaiver\" may result in a long stereotypical paragraph of text, the further analysis of which would be totally .counter-productive. 3 Interaction Grammars Let us now give some details about the formalism of Interaction Grammars. We start by explaining the notion of choice tree on the basis of a simple context-free grammar, analogous to a DTD. Context-free grammars and choice trees Let's consider the following context-free grammar for describing simple \"addresses\" in English such as \"Paris, France\": s address --> city, \",\",","country. country --> \"France\". country --> \"Germany\". city --> \"Paris\". city --> \"Hamburg\". city --> \"the capital of\",","country.","What does it mean, remembering the XML analogy, to author a \"document\" with such a CFG? It means that the author is iteratively presented with partial derivation trees relative to the grammar (partial in the sense that leaves can be terminals or non-terminals), and at each given authoring step both selects a certain nonterminal to \"refine\", and also a given rule to extend this non-terminal one step further: this action is repeated until the derivation tree is complete.","If one conventionally uses the identifier nonterminal~ to name the i-th rule expanding the nonterminal nonterminal, then the collection of choices made by the author during a session can be represented by a choice tree labelled with rule identifiers, also called combinators. An example of such a tree is addressl(city2,country2)","4This kind of semantic representation stands i-n contrast to some representations commonly used in NLP, which tend to emphasize the fine-grained predicate-argument structure of sentences independently of the productivity of such analyses .[or a given class of documents.","5For compatibility with the notacionsCo follow, we use lowercase to denote nonlerminals, aml quoted strings to denote terminals, rather than tile inore usna[ ul)pot'case lowercase convent ions. which corresponds to choices leading to the output \"Hamburg, Germany\". 6 In.practice, rather than using combinator names which strictly adhere to this numbering scheme, we prefer to use mnemonic names directly relating to the meaning of the choices. In the sequel we will use the names adr; fra, ger, par, ham, cap for the six rules in the example grammar. The choice tree just described is thus written adr(ham,ger). Making choice trees explicit As we have argued previously, choices trees are in our view the cen- . tral repositoi-y of documentc0ntent and we Want to manipulate them explicitely. Definite Clause Grammars represent possibly the simplest extension of context-free grammars permitting such manipula-tion. Our context-free grammar can be extended straightforwardly into the DCG: 7 address(adr(Co,C)) --> city(C), \",\"","country(Co). country(fra) --> \"France\". country(ger) --> \"Germany\". city(par) --> \"Paris\". city(ham) --> \"Hamburg\". city(cap(Co)) --> \"the capital of\",","country(Co).","What these rules do is simply to construct choice trees recursively. Thus, the first rule says that if the author has described a city through the choice tree C and a country through the choice tree Co, then the choice tree adr(Co,C) represents the description of an address.","If now, in this DCG, we \"forget\" all the terminals, which are language-specific, by replacing them with the empty string, we obtain the following \"abstract gram mar'l: address(adr(Co,C)) --> city(C), country(Co). country(fra) --> []. country(ger) --> []. city(par) --> []. city(ham) --> []. city(cap(Co)) --> country(Co).","which is in fact equivalent to the definite clause program: s","SSuch a choice tree can be projected into a derivation tree in a straightforward way, by mapping a combinator nonterminali into the monterminal name nontermin,:.l, and by 'introducing terminal material as required by the specific rules.","7According to the usual logic programming conventions, lowercase letters denote predicates and functors, whereas uppercase letters denote metavariables that can be instauciated with terms.","Sin the sense that rewriting the nonterminal goal address (adr (Co ,C)) to the empty string in the DCG is equivalent to proving the goal address(adr(Co,C)) in the program, 26 address(adr(Co,C)) :- city(C), country(Co). country (f ra). country (ger). city(par). city(ham). city(cap(Co)) :- country(Co).","This abstract grammar (or, equivalently, this logic program), is language independent and recursively defines a set of well-formed choice trees of different"]},{"title":"categories,","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"types.","paragraphs":["Thus, the tree adr(ham,ger) is .well-formed \"in\".. the. :typ~/add.~:r~s, ,End the .lice cap(fra) well-formed in the type city. Dependent Types In order to stress the type-related aspects of the previous tree specifications, we are actually using in our current implementa-tion the following notation for the previous abstract grammar:","adr(Co,C)::address --> C::city, Co : : country. fra: :country --> [] . ger: :country --> [] . par: :city --> [3 . ham: :city --> []. cap(Co)::city --> Co::country.","The first rule is then read: \"if C is a tree of type city, and Co a tree of type country, then adr(Co,C) is a tree of type address\", and similarly for the remaining rules.","The grammars we have given so far are deficient in one important respect: there is no dependency between the city and the country in the same address, so that the tree adr(ham,fra) is well-formed in the type address. In order to remedy this problena, dependent types (Ranta; Martin-L6f, 1984)can be used. From our point of view, a dependent type is simply a type that can be parametrized by objects of other types. We write:","adr(Co,C)::address --> C::city(Co), Co: :country. fra: :country --> [] . get: :country --> [] . par::city(fra) --> []. ham::city(ger) --> []. cap(Co)::city(Co) --> Co::country.","in which the type city is now parametrized by objects of type country, and where the notation par : : city(fra) is read as \"'paris atree of the type: city of fra'. 9 which is another way of stating the well-known duality between the rewriting and the goal-proving approaches to the interpretation of Prolog.","9In terms of the underlying Prolog implementation. \"::\" is simply an infix operator for a predicate of arity 2 which relates an object and its type, and both simple and dependent types are handled st raighforwardly.

In this paper, we have stressed the connections between these practices and current research in natural language generation and authoring. We have described a formalism which removes some of the limitations of DTD's when used for the production of multilingual texts and presented its application to a certain domain of pharmaceutical documents.
