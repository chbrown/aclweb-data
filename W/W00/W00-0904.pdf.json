We tested the predictions made by these measures about corpus difficulty in two domains -- news and molecular biology -- using the result of two well-used paradigms for NE, decision trees and HMMs and found that gain ratio was the more reliable predictor. made by these measures against actual system performance.","Recently IE systems based on supervised learning paradigms such as hidden Markov models (Bikel et al., 1997), maximum entropy (Borthwick et al., 1998) and decision trees (Sekine et al., 1998) have emerged that should be easier to adapt to new domains than the dictionary-based systems of the past. Much of this work has taken advantage of smoothing techniques to overcome problems associated with data sparseness (Chen and Goodman, 1996).","The two corpora we use in our NE experiments represent the following domains: 1 Introduction With the advent of the information society and increasing availability of large mounts of information in electronic form, new technologies such as information extraction are emerging to meet user's information access needs.

This is a result of the need to formalise the huge number of research results that appear in free-text form in online collections of journal abstracts and papers such as MEDLINE for databases such as Swissprot (Ban:och and Apwefler, 1997) and also to search such collections for facts in an intelligent way.","The purpose of our study is not to show a high level of absolute system performance. In fact since we use only the MUC-6 executive succession data set of 60 articles and a new MEDLINE data set of 100 articles we cannot hope to achieve performance limits. What we aim to do is to compare model performance against the predictions of corpus difficulty made by two different methods. In the rest of this paper we firstly introduce the NE models used for evaluation, the two corpora we 20 examined and then the difficulty comparison metrics. Predictive scores from the metrics are examined against the actual performance of the NE models. 2 Models Recent studies into the use of supervised learning-based modeels for the NE task in the molecular-biology domain have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Collier et al., 2000) and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999) are not only adaptable to this highly technical domain, but are also much more generalizable to new classes of words than systems based on traditional hand-built heuristic rules such as (Fukuda et al., 1998). We now describe two models used in our experiments based on the decision trees package C4.5 (Quiuian, 1993) and HMMs (Rabiner and Juang, 1986).","2.1 Decision tree named entity recogniser:NE-DT A decision tree is a type of classifier which has \"leaf nodes\" indicating classes and \"decision nodes\" that specify some test to be carried out, with one branch or subtree for each possible outcome of the test. A decision tree can be used to classify an object by starting at the root of the tree and moving through it until a leaf is encountered. When we can define suitable features for the decision tree, the system can achieve good performance with only a small amount of training data.","The system we used is based on one that was originally created for Japanese documents (Seine et al., 1998). It has two phases, one for creating the decision tree from training data and the other for generating the class-tagged text based on the decision tree. When generating decision trees, trigrams of words were used. For this system, words are considered to be quadruple features. The following features are used to generate conditions in the decision tree:","Part-of-speech information: There are 45 part-of-speech categories, whose definitions are based on Pennsylvania Treebank's categories. We use a tagger based on Adwait Ratnaparkhi's method (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).","Character type information: Orthographic information is considered such as upper case, lower case, capitalization, numerical expressions, symbols. These character features are the same as those used by NEHMM described in the next section and shown in Table 1.","Word lists specific to the domain: Word lists are made from the training corpus. Only the 200 highest fxequency words are used. 2.2 Hidden Markov model named entity","reco~.iser: NEHMM HMMs are a widely u~d class of learning algorithms and can be considered to be stochastic finite state machines. In the following model, summarized here from the full description given in (Collier et al., 2000), we consider words to be or-dered pairs consisting of a surface word, W, and a word feature, F, given as < W, F >. The word features themselves are discussed below. As is common practice, we need to calculate the probabilities for a word sequence for the first word's name class and every other word differently since we have no initial name-class to make a transition from. Accordingly we use the following equation to calculate the initial name class probability,","Pr(NC~[ < Wf~,t , Flli,,~ >)= aof(NC$,,s,[ < Wf,,,,,Ffi,,t >)+"]},{"title":"o~f(gcs~,,,I","paragraphs":["< -,Ff~,,, >) + a~f(NCfi,.,,)"]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["and for all other words and their name classes as follows: Fr(NCT~ I < Wt,Ft >,< W~-,,Ft-, >,NC~-i) = Aof(NGtl < W~,F~ >,< Wt-,,Ft-1 >,NG~-,) + Alf(NCtI < .,F~ >,< W~-I,F~-i >,NC~-i)+ A2f(NC~I < W,,F~ >, < .. F,-, >,NCt-x) + AsI(NG, I < .,Ft >,< _, F~-, >,NG,-,)+ A4f(NC, INC,-,) + Asf(NC,) (2) where f(I) is calculated with maximum-likelihood estimates from counts on training data. In our current system we set the constants Ai and al by hand and let ~ ai = 1.0, ~ Ai = 1.0, ao _> al > ~, ~o >_ A,... >_ As. The current name-class NCt is conditioned on the current word and feature, the previous name-class, NCt-1, and previous word and feature.","Equations 1 and 2 implement a linearinterpolating HMM that incorporates a number of sub-models designed to reduce the effects of data sparseness.

The final stage of our algorithm that is used after narae-class tagging is complete is to use a clean-up module called Unity. This creates a frequency list of words and name-classes and then re-tags the text using the most frequently used name class assigned by the HMM. We have generally found that this improves F-score performance by between 2 and 4%, both for re-tagging spuriously tagged words and for finding untagged words in unknown contexts that had been correctly tagged elsewhere in the text.","Table 1 shows the char~ter features that we used in both NEHMM and NE-DT. Our intuition is that such features will help the model to find similarities between known words that were found in the training set and unknown words and so overcome the unknown word problem. 3 Corpora We used two corpora in our experiments representing two popular domains in IE, molecular-biology (from MEDLINE) and newswire texts (from MUC-6). These are now described. 3.1 MUC-6 The corpus for MUC-6 (MUC, 1995) contains 60 articles, from the test corpus for the dry and for-malruns. An example canbe seenin Figure 1. We can see several interesting features of the domain such as the focus of NF.,s on people and organiza-tion profiles. Moreover we see that there are many pre-name clue words such as \"Ms.\" or \"Rep.\" indicating that a Republican politician's name should follow. 3.2 Biology In our tests in the domain of molecular-biology we are using abstracts available from PubMed's MEDLIhrE. The MEDLINE database is an online collection of abstracts for published journal articles in biology and medicine and contains more than nine million articles. Currently we have extracted a subset of MEDLINE based on a search using the keywords human AND blood cell AND transcription .factor yielding about 3650 abstracts. Of these 100 docmnents were NE tagged for our experiments using a human domain expert. An example of the annotated abstracts is shown in Figure 2. In contrast to MUC-6 each article is quite short and there are few pre-class clue words making the task much more like terminology identification and classification than pure name finding.","4 A first attempt at corpus comparison based on simple token frequency A simple and intuitive approach to NE task difficulty comparison used in some previous studies such as (palmer and Day, 1997) who studied corpora in six different languages, compares class to term-token ratios on the assumption that rarer classes are more difficult to acquire. The relative frequency counts from these ratios also give an in-direct measure of the"]},{"title":"granularity","paragraphs":["of a class, i.e. how wide it is. While this is appealing, we show that this approach does not necessarily give the best metric for comparison.","Tables 2 and 3 show the ratio of the number of different words used in NEs to the total number of words in the NE class vocabulary. The number of different tokens is influenced by the corpus size and is not a suitable index that can uniformly show the difficulty for different NE tasks, therefore it should be normalized. Here we use words as tokens. A value close to zero indicates little variation within the class and should imply that the class is easier to acquire. We see that the NEs in the biology domain seem overall to be easier to acquire than those in the MUC-6 domain given hxical variation.","The figures in the second columns of Tables 2 and 3 are normalized so that all numerals are replaced by a single token. It still seems though that MUC-6 is a considerably more eheJlenging domain than biology.

However, the distribution of the character types are quite different between these two types of documents as we can see in Table 5. We see through the gain-ratio score that character type information has a greater predictive power for classes in MUC~ than biology due to the higher entropy of character type and class sequences in the biology corpus, i.e. the greater disorder of this information. The result partially shows why identification and classification is harder in biological documents than in newspaper articles such as the MUC-6 corpus. 6.2 Part-of-speech Table 6 shows the entropy scores for part-of-speech (POS) sequences in the two corpora. We see through the gain ratio scores that POS information is not so powerful for acquiring NEs in the biology domain compared to the MUC-6 domain. 24","Table 5: Values of Entropy for character type Entropy MUC-6 Biology H(T) [[ 1.880 2.013 H(C)"]},{"title":"II 0.890 1.264 H(C,T) II 2.345 2.974 I(C;T) [I .0.425 0.302 GR(C;T) H 0.478 0.239","paragraphs":["Table 6: Values of Entropy for POSs Entropy MUC-6 Biology \"H(P) 4.287 4.037 H(C) 0.890 1.264 H(C,P) 4.750 5.029 I(C;P) 0.426 0.272 GR(C;P) 0.479 0.216 In fact POS information for biology is far less useful than character information when we compare the results in Tables 5 and 6, whereas POS has about the same predictive power as character information in the MUC-6 domain. One likely explanation for this is that the POS tagger we use in NE-DT is trained on a corpus based on newspaper articles, therefore the assigned POS tags are often incorrect in biology documents. 6.3 Lexical information Table 7 shows the entropy statistics for the two domains. Although entropy for words in biology is lower than MUC-6, the entropy for classes is higher leading to a lower gain ratio in biology. We also note that, as we would expect, in comparison to the other two types of knowledge, surface word forms are by far the most useful type of knowledge with a gain ratio in MUC-6 of 0.897 compared to 0.479 for POS and 0.478 for character types in the same domain. However, such knowledge is also the least generalizable and runs the risk of data-sparseness. It therefore has to be complemented by more generalizable knowledge such as character features and POS.","Table 7: Values of Entropy for words --Entropy MUC-6 Biology H(W) 9.570 8.89O H(C) 0.890 1.264 H(C,W) 9.662 9.232 I(C;W) 0.798 0.921 ~R(C;W)"]},{"title":"0.897 0.729","paragraphs":["Table 8: Values of Entropy for NEHMM features in the MUC-6 corpus GR 0.994 0.898 0.967 0.798 0.340 0.806 0.461 0.558 0.221 0.806 0.563 0.971 0.633 Cross Entropy 5.38(4.08-9.68) 7.69(6.97-9.32) 7.73(7.07-9.30) 4.38(4.12-.-4.82) 1.62(1.32-1.90) 7.65(7.11-8.65) 2.64(2.41-2.97) 7.91(7.25--8.99) 2.94(2.70-3.25) 7.65(7.11-6.65) 7.92(7.26-9.03) 5.42(4.10-9.70) 4.18(3.91-4.60)","Coverage o.44(o.34-o.78) O. 77(0.72-0.90) 0.79(0.73-0.90) 0.99(0.98-1.00) L00(1.00-L00) 0.65(0.81-0.93) 1.00(0.99-1.00) 0.83(0.79-0.92) 1.00(1.00-1.00) 0.85(0.81,-0.93) 0.83(0.79-0.92) 0.44 (0.34-O.75) 0.99(0.99--1.00) Features. for A0 for Al for A2 for As Ct-1 Wt Ft Wt-I F~-x Wt Fz W~-l F=-i Wt-l,~ F~-Lt Table in the biology corpus GR Cross Entropy 0.977 5.83(5.66-6.14) 0.793 7.93(7.77-8.08) 0.929 7.79(7.65-7.85) 0.643 5.07(4.95-5.21) 0.315 2.26(2.24--2.28) 0.694 7.64(7.52-7.78) 0.257 3.12(3.06--3.19) 0.423 7.99(7.62-8.08) 0.093 3.33(3.27-3,43) 0.694 7.64(7.52-7.78) 0.424 7.98(7.82-8.04) 0.904 5.96(5.78-6.24) 0.339 4.66(4.53-4,78) 9: Values of Entropy for NEHMM features","Coverage 0.49(0.48--0.52) o.6o(o.79-o.61) o.so(o.70-o.81) 0.98(0.98-0.98) 1.00(1.00-I.00) 0.89(0.87-0.89) 1.oo(1.OO-l.OO) 0.87(0.86-0.88) 1.00(1.00-1.00) 0.89(0.87-0,89) o.87(0.85-0.86) 0.50(0.49-0.52) 0.99(0.98-0.99) Features for ~to for A1 for ~t2 for As Ct- I W= Fe Wt Ft Wt-1 F,-z Wz-l,t F~-l,t 6.4 Comparison between the","comblnutlon of features In this section we show a comparison of gain ratio for the features used by both systems in each corpus.

These values are calculated for pairs of an NE class and features, and averaged for the n-fold experiments. In the MUC-6 corpus, 60 texts are separated into 6 subsets, and one of them is used as the test set and the others are put together to form a training set. Similarly, 100 texts are separated into 5 subsets in the biology corpus. We also show the coverage of the pairs on the 'Coverage' col,,mn. Coverage means that how many pairs which appeared in a test set also appear in a trainlug set.","In these columns, the greater the cross entropy between features and a class, the more different their occurrences between tr~iuing and test sets. On the other hand, as the coverage for class-features pairs increases, so does the part of the test set that is covered with the given feature set.","The results in both corpora for both systems show a drawback of surface words, since their coverage for a test set is lower than that of features like POSs and character types in both corpora Also, the coverage of surface words in the biology corpus is higher than in the MUC6 corpus as opposed to other features. The result matches our intuition that vocabulary in the biology corpus is relatively restricted but has a variety of types other than normal English words. 7 Conclusion The need for soundly-motivated metrics to compare the usefulness of corpora for specific tasks and systems is dearly necessary for the development of robust and portable information extraction systems.","In this paper we have shown that measures for comparing corpora based just on class-token ratios have difficulty predicting system performance and cannot adequately explain the difficulty of the NE task either generally or for specific systems.","While we should be cautious in ma~ng sweep-ing conclusions due to the small size of corpora in our study, our results from gain ratio and cross entropy indicate that counts from the features of both systems will be more useful in the MUC6 corpus than in the biology corpus. We can also see that while the coverage is limited, surface words play a leading role for both systems. Gain ratio statistics for surface words in the two domains were far closer than for any other type of feature, and given that this is also the dominant knowledge type this seems to be one likely reason that the performance of systems is about the same in both domains.","We have presented the results of applying two supervised learning based models to the named entity task in two widely different domains and explained the performance through class-token ratios, entropy and gain ratio. Measures such as entropy and gain ratio have been found to have the best predictive power, although the features used to calculate gain ratio are not sufficient to describe all the information that is necessary for the named entity task. In future work we intend to extend our study to new and larger NE corpora in various domains and to try to reduce the error factor in our calculations that is a result of corpus size. References","A.
