This paper addresses the reduction of parsing complexity by intra-sentence segmentation, and presents maximum entropy model for determining segmentation positions. The model features lexical contexts of segmentation positions, giving a probability to each potential position. Segmentation coverage and accuracy of the proposed method are 96% and 88% respectively. The parsing efficiency is improved by 77% in time and 71% in space. 1 Introduction Long sentence analysis has been a critical problem in machine translation because of high complexity. In EBMT (example-based machine translation), the longer a sentence is, the less possible it is that the sentence has an exact match in the translation archive, and the less flexible an EBMT system will be (Cranias et al., 1994). In idiom-based machine translation (Lee, 1993), long sentence parsing is difficult because more resources are spent during idiom recognition phase as sentence length increases. A parser is often un-able to analyze long sentences owing to their complexity, though they have no grammatical errors (Nasukawa, 1995).","In English-Korean machine translation, idiom-based approach is adopted to overcome the structural differences between two languages and to get more accurate translation. The parser is a chart parser with a capability of idiom recognition and translation, which is adapted to English-Korean machine tranalation. Idioms are recognized prior to syntactic analysis and the part of a sentence for an idiom takes an edge in a chart (Winograd, 1983). When parsing long sentences, an ambiguity of an idiom's range may cause more edges than the number of words included in the idiom (Yoon, 1994), which increases parsing complexity much. A parser of practical machine translation system should be able to analyze long sentences in a reasonable time.","Most context-free parsing algorithms have O(n 3) parsing complexities in terms of time and space, where n is the length of a sentence (Tomita, 1986). Our work is motivated by the fact that parsing becomes more efficient, if n becomes shorter. This paper deals with the problem of parsing complexity by way of reducing the length of sentence to be analyzed. This reduction is achieved by intra-sentence segmentation, which is distinguished from inter--sentence segmentation that is used for text categorization (Beeferman et al., 1997) or sentence boundary identification (Palmer and Hearst, 1997) (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). Intra-sentence segmentation plays a role as a preliminary step to a chart-based, context-free parser in English-Korean machine translation.","There have been several methods for reducing parsing complexities by intra-sentence segmentation. In (Lyon and Frank, 1995)(Lyon and Dickerson, 1997), they took advantage of the fact that the declarative sentences almost always consist of three segments: [pre-subject : subject:predicate]. The complexity could be reduced by decomposing a sentence into three sections. Pattern rules (Li et al., 1990) and sentence patterns (Kim and Khn, 1995) were used to segment long English sentences. They showed low segmentation coverage, which means that many of long sentences are not segmented by the pattern rules or sentence patterns. And they require much human efforts to construct pattern rules or collect sentence patterns. These factors may prevent them being applicable to practical machine translation sYstems.","This paper presents a trainable model for identifying potential segmentation positions 164 in a sentence and determining appropriate segmentation positions. Given a corpus annotated with segmentation positions, our model automatically learns the contextual evidences about segmentation positions, which relieves human of burden to construct pattern rules or sentence patterns. These evidences are combined under the maximum entropy framework (Jaynes, 1957) to estimate the probability for each position. By intra-sentence segmentation based on the proposed model, we achieve more improved parsing efficiency by 77% in time and 71% in space.","In Section 2 we introduce the maximum entropy model. Section 3 describes features incorporated into the model and the process of identifying potential segmentation positions. The determination schemes of segmentation positions are described in Section 4. Segmentation performance of the model is presented with the degree of contribution to efficient parsing by the segmentation in Section 5. We also compare our approach with other intra-sentence segmentation approaches. Section 6 draws conclusions and presents some further works. 2 Maximum Entropy Modeling Sentence patterns or pattern ruels specify the sub-structures of the sentences. That is, segmentation positions are determined in view of the global sentence structure. If there is no matched rules or patterns with a given sentence, the sentence could not be segmented. We assume that whether a word is a segmentation position depends on its surrounding context. We try to find factors that affect the determination of segmentation positions. Maximum entropy is a technique for automatically acquiring knowledge from incomplete information, without making any unsubstantiated assumptions. It masters subtle effects so that we may accurately model subtle dependencies. It does not make any unwarranted assumptions, which means that maximum entropy learns exactly what the data says. Therefore it can perform well on unseen data.","The idea is to construct a model that as-signs a probability to each potential segmentation position in a sentence.

A segmentation can be called safe segmentation that results in a coherent blocks of words. In English-Korean translation, safe segmentation is defined as the one which generates safe segments. A segment is safe, when there is a syntactic category symbol N P dominating the segment and the segment can be combined with adjacent segments under a given grammar. In Figure 1, (a) is an unsafe segmentation because the second segment cannot be analyzed into one syntactic category, resulting in parsing failure. By the safe segmentation (b), the first segment corresponds to a noun phrase and the second to a verb phrase, so that we can get a correct analysis result.

Thus intra-sentence segmentation is required as a means for reducing parsing complexity. This paper presents a method for intra-sentence segmentation based on the maximum entropy model. The method builds statistical models automatically from a text corpus to provide the segmentation appropriateness for safe segmentation.","In the experiments with 1800 test sentences, about 87% of them were benefited from segmentation. The statistical intra-sentence segmentation method can also relieve human of the burden of constructing information, such as segmentation rules or sentence patterns. Experiments suggest that the proposed maximum entropy models can be incorporated into the parser for practical machine translation systems.","Further works can be done in two directions. First, studies on recovery mechanisms for unsafe segmentation before parsing seem necessary since ungafe segmentation may cause parsing failures. Second, parsing control mechanisms should be studied that exploit the -characteristics of segmentation positions and the parallelism among segments. This will enhance parsing efficiency further.","References","D. Beeferman, A. Berger, and J. Lafferty. 1997. Text Segmentation using Exponential Models.
