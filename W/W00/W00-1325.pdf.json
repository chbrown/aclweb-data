However, the accuracy of the resulting lexicons shows room for improvement. One significant source of error lies in the statistical filtering used by some researchers to remove noise from automatically acquired subcategorization frames. In this paper, we compare three different approaches to filtering out spurious hypotheses. Two hypothesis tests perform poorly, compared to filtering frames on the basis of relative frequency. We discuss reasons for this and consider directions for future research. 1 Introduction Subcategorization information is vital for successful parsing, however, manual development of large subcategorized lexicons has proved difficult because predicates change behaviour between sublanguages, domains and over time. Additionally, manually developed sucategorization lexicons do not provide the relative frequency of different SCFs for a given predicate, essential in a probabilistic approach.","Over the past years acquiring subcategorization dictionaries from textual corpora has become increasingly popular. The different approaches (e.g. Brent, !991, 1993; Ushioda"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000) vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFS being extracted. Regardless of this, there is a ceiling on the performance of these systems at around 80% token recall 1","zWhere token recall is the percentage .of SCF to-kens in a sample of manually analysed text that were","The approaches to extracting SCF information from corpora have frequently employed statistical methods for filtering (e.g. Brent, 1993; Manning 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Lapata, 1999). This has been done to remove the noise that arises when dealing with naturally occurring data, and from mistakes made by the SCF acquisition system, for example, parser errors.","Filtering is usually done with a hypothesis test, and frequently with a variation of the binomial filter introduced by Brent (1991, 1993). Hypothesis testing is performed by for-mulating a null hypothesis, (H0), which is as-sumed true unless there is evidence to the contrary. If there is evidence to the contrary, H0 is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted.

Accord-ing to one account (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) the majority of errors arise because of the statistical filtering process, which is reported to be particularly unreliable for low frequency SCFs (Brent, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Manning and Schiitze, 1999). Lapata (1999) reported that a threshold on the relative frequencies produced slightly better results than those achieved with a Brent-correctly acquired by the system. 199 style binomial filter when establishing SCFs for diathesis alternation detection.

The system employs a shallow parser to obtain the subcategorization information. Potential SCF entries are filtered before the final SCF lexicon is produced. The filter is the only component of this system which we experiment with here. The three filtering methods which we compare are described below. 2.2 Filtering Methods 2.2.1 Binomial Hypothesis Test Briscoe and Carroll (1997) used a binomial hypothesis test (BHT) to filter the acquired SCFs.

A threshold, determined empirically, was applied to these probability estimates to filter out the low probability entries for each verb. ....","2See (Gorrell, 1999) for details of this\" method. 201 3 Evaluation 3.1 Method To evaluate the different approaches, we took a sample of 10 million words of the BNC corpus (Leech, 1992). We extracted all sentences containing an occurrence of one of fourteen verbs 3. The verbs were chosen at random, subject to the constraint that they exhibited multiple complementation patterns. After the extraction process, we retained 3000 citations, on average, for each verb. The sentences containing these verbs were processed by the SCF acquisition system, and then we applied the three filtering methods described above. We also obtained results for a baseline without any filtering.","The results were evaluated against a manual analysis of corpus data 4. This was obtained by analysing up to a maximum of 300 occurrences for each of the 14 test verbs in LOB (Garside et al., 1987), Susanne and SEC (Taylor and Knowles, 1988) corpora. Follow-ing Briscoe and Carroll (1997), we calculated precision (percentage of SCFS acquired which were also exemplified in the manual analysis) and recall (percentage of the SCFs exemplified in the manual analysis which were acquired automatically). We also combined precision and recall into a single measure of overall performance using the F measure (MA.nniug and Schiitze, 1999).","F = 2.precision. recall (5) precision + recall 3.2 Results Table 1 gives the raw results for the 14 verbs using each method. It shows the number of true positives (TP), .false positives (FP), and .false negatives (FN), as determined according to the manual analysis. The results for high frequency SCFs (above 0.01 relative frequency), medium frequency (between 0.001 and 0.01) and low frequency (below 0.001) SCFs are listed respectively in the second,","3These verbs were ask, begin, believe, cause, expect, find, give, help, like, move, produce, provide, seem, swing.","4The importance of the manual analysis is outlined in Briscoe and Carroll (1997). We use the same manual analysis as Briscoe and Carroll, Le. one from the Susanne, LOB, and SEC corpora. A manual analysis of the BNC data might produce better results. However, since the BNC is a heterogeneous corpus we felt it was reasonable to test the data on a different corpus, which is also heterogeneous. third and fourth columns, and the final column includes the total results for all frequency ranges.","Table 2 shows precision and recall for the 14 verbs and the F measure, which combines precision and recall. We also provide the baseline results, if all SCFs were accepted.","From the results given in tables 1 and 2, the MLE approach outperformed both hypothesis tests. For both BHT and LLR there was an increase in FNs at high frequencies, and an increase in FPs at medium and low frequencies, when compared to MLE. The number of errors was typically larger for LLR than BHT. The hypothesis tests reduced the number of FNS at medium and low frequencies, however, this was countered by the substantial increase in FPs that they gave. While BHT nearly always acquired the three most frequent SCFs of verbs correctly, LLR tended to reject these.","While the high number of FNS can be explained by reports which have shown LLR to be over-conservative (Ribas, 1995; Pedersen, 1996), the high number of FPs is surprising. Although theoretically, the strength of LLR lies in its suitability for low frequency data, the results displayed in table 1 do not suggest that the method performs better than BHT on low frequency frames.","MLE thresholding produced better results than the two statistical tests used. Precision improved considerably, showing that the classes occurring in the data with the high-est frequency are often correct. Although MLE thresholding clearly makes no attempt to solve the sparse data problem, it performs better than BHT or LLR overall. MLE is not adept at finding low frequency SCFS, however, the other methods are problematic in that they wrongly accept more than they correctly reject. The baseline, of accepting all SCFS, obtained a high recall at the expense of precision. 3.3 Discussion Our results indicate that MLE outperforms both hypothesis tests. There are two explanations for this, and these are jointly responsible for the results.","Firstly, the SCF distribution is zipfian, as are many distributions concerned with natural language (Manning and Schiitze, 1999).

The unconditional probability distribution uses the occurrence of scfi with any verb other than our target.","The binomial tests look at one point in the SCF distribution at a time, for a given verb. The expected value is determined using the unconditional distribution, on the assumption that if the null hypothesis is true then this distribution will correlate with the conditional distribution. However, this is rarely the case. Moreover, because of the zipfian nature of the distributions, the frequency differences at any point can be substantial. In these experiments, we used one-tailed tests because we were looking for cases where there was a positive association between the SCF and verb, however, in a two-tailed test the null hypothesis would rarely be accepted, because of the substantial differences in the conditional and unconditional distributions.","A large number of false negatives occurred for high frequency SCFs because the probability we compared them to was too high. This probability was estimated from the combination of many verbs genuinely occurring with the frame in question, rather than from an estimate of background noise from verbs which did not occur with the frame. We did not use an estimate from verbs which do not take the SCF, since this would require a priori knowledge about the phenomena that we were endeavouring to acquire automatically. For LLR the unconditional probability estimate (p2) was high, simply because this SCF was a common one, rather than because the data was particularly noisy. For BHT, R e was likewise too high as the SCF was also common in the Susanne data. The ANLT estimate went some-way to compensating for this, thus we obtained fewer false negatives with BHT than LLR.","A large number of false positives occurred for low frequency SCFs because the estimate for"]},{"title":"p(scf)","paragraphs":["was low.

For LLR, there was no mean~ to compensate for the fact that p2 was lower than pl.","In contrast, MLE did not compare two distributions. Simply rejecting the low frequency data produced better results overall by avoid-ing the false positives with the low frequency data, and the false negatives with the high frequency data. 4 Conclusion This paper explored three possibilities for filtering out the SCF entries produced by a SCF acquisition system. These were (i) a version of Brent's binomial filter, commonly used for this purpose, (ii) the binomial log-likelihood 204 ratio test, recommended for use with low frequency data and (iii) a simple method using a threshold on the MLEs of the SCFS output from the system. Surprisingly, the simple MLE thresholding method worked best. The BHT and LLR both produced an astounding mlmber of FPs, particularly at low frequencies.","Further work on handling low frequency data in SCF acquisition is warranted. A non-parametric statistical test, such as Fisher's exact test, recommended by Pedersen (1996), might improve on the results obtained using parametric tests. However, it seems from our experiments that it would be better to avoid hypothesis tests that make use of the unconditional distribution.","One possibility is to put more effort into the estimation of"]},{"title":"pe,","paragraphs":["and to avoid use of the unconditional distribution for this.

Nevertheless, the precision result was 14% worse for precision than MLE, though there was a 4% improvement in recall, making the overall performance 3.9 worse than MLE according to the F measure. Lapata (1999) also reported that a simple relative frequency cut off produced slightly better results than a Brent style BHT.","If MLE thresholding persistently achieves better results, it would be worth investigating ways of handling the low frequency data, such as smoothing, for integration with this method. However, more sophisticated smoothing methods, which back-off to an un-Conditional distribution, will also suffer from the lack of correlation between conditional and unconditional SCF distributions. Any statistical test would work better at low frequencies than the MLE, since this simply disregards all low frequency SCFs. In our experiments, ff we had used MLE only for the high frequency data, and BHT for medium and low, then overall we would have had 54% precision and 67% recall. It certainly seems worth employing hypothesis tests which do not rely on the unconditional distribution for the low frequency SCFS. 5 Acknowledgements We thank Ted Briscoe for many helpful discussions and suggestions concerning this work.
