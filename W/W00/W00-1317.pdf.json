Objects are represented as logical terms and are typed with a semantic category using logical functions applied to possibly ambiguous English constants (e.g."]},{"title":"stateid(Mississippi), riverid(Mississippi)).","paragraphs":["Relationships between objects are expressed using predicates; for in-stance, Ioc(X,Y) states that X is located in Y.","We also need to handle quantifiers such as 'largest'. We represent these using meta-predicates for which at least one argument is a conjunction ofliterals. For example, largest(X, Goal) states that the object X satisfies Goal and is the largest object that does so, using the appropriate measure of size for objects of its type (e.g. area for states, population for cities). Finally, an nn.qpeci~ed object required as an argument to a predicate can appear else-where in the sentence, requiring the use of the predicate const(X,C) to bind the variable X to the constant C. Some other database queries (or training examples) for the U.S. Geography domain are shown below: What is the capital of Texas? a nswer(C,(ca pital(C,S),const(S,stateid (texas)))). What state has the most rivers running through it? a nswer(S,most (S,R,(state(S),rlver(R),traverse(R,S)))). 2.2 Parsing Actions Our semantic parser employs a shift-reduce architecture that maintains a stack of previously built semantic constituents and a buffer of remaining words in the input. The parsing actions are automatically generated from templates given the training data. The templates are INTRODUCE, COREF_VABS, DROP_CON J, LIFT_CON J, and SttIFT. INTRODUCE pushes a predicate onto the stack based on a word appearing in the input and information about its possible meanings in the lexicon. COREF_VARS binds two arguments of two different predicates on the stack. DROP_CONJ (or LIFT_CON J) takes a predicate on the stack and puts it into one of the arguments of a meta-predicate on the stack. SHIFT simply pushes a word from the input buffer onto the stack. The parsing actions are tried in exactly this order. The parser also requires a lexicon to map phrases in the input into specific predicates, this lexicon can also be learned automatically from the training data (Thompson and Mooney, 1999).","Let's go through a simple trace of parsing the request \"What is the capital of Texas?\" A lexicon that maps 'capital' to 'capital(_,_)' and 'Texas' to 'const(_,stateid(texas))' su.~ces 134 here. Interrogatives like \"what\" may be mapped to predicates in the lexicon if necessary. The parser begins with an initial stack and a buffer holding the input sentence. Each predicate on the parse stack has an attached buffer to hold the context in which it was introduced; words from the input sentence are shifted onto this buffer during parsing.

Positive and negative examples are collected for each action by parsing each tralnlng example and recordlng the parse states encountered. Parse states to which an action should be applied (i.e. the action leads to building the correct semantic representation) are labeled positive examples for that action. Otherwise, a parse state is labeled a negative example for an action if it is a positive example for another action below the current one in the ordered list of actions. Control conditions which decide the correct action for a given parse state axe learned for each action from these positive and negative examples.","The initial CHILL system used ILP (Lavrac and Dzeroski, 1994) to learn Prolog control rules and employed deterministic parsing, using the learned rules to decide the appropriate parse action for each state. The current approach learns a model for estimating the probability that each action should be applied to a given state, and employs statistical parsing (Manning and Schiitze, 1999) to try to find the overall most probable parse, using beam search to control the complexity. The advantage of ILP is that it can perform induction over the logical description of the complete parse state without the need to pre-engineer a fixed set of features (which vary greatly from one domain to another) that are relevant to making decisions. We maintain this advantage by using ILP to learn a committee of hypotheses, and basing probability estimates on a weighted vote of them (Ali and Pazzani, 1996). We believe that using such a probabilistic relational model (Getoor and Jensen, 2000) combines the advantages of frameworks based on first-order logic and those based on standard statistical techniques. 3 The TABULATE ILP"]},{"title":"Method","paragraphs":["This section discusses the ILP method used to build a committee of logical control hypotheses for each action."]},{"title":"3.1 The","paragraphs":["Basic TABULATE"]},{"title":"Algorithm","paragraphs":["Most ILP methods use a set-covering method to learn one clause (rule) at a time and construct clauses using either a strictly top-down (general to specific) or bottom-up (specific to general) search through the space of possible rules (Lavrac and Dzeroski, 1994). TABULATE, 1 on the other hand, employs both bottom-up and top-down methods to construct potential clauses and searches through the hypothesis space of complete logic programs (i.e. sets of clauses called theories).

Each iteration of the loop attempts to refine each of the hypotheses in the current search queue. There are two cases in each iteration: 1) an existing clause in a theory is refined or 2) a new clause is begun. Clauses are learned using both top-down specialiT.~- tion using a method similar to FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) and bottom-up generalization using Least General Generalizations (LGG's). Advantages of combining both ILP approaches were explored in CHILLIN (ZeUe and Mooney, 1994), an ILP method which motivated the design of TABULATE. An outline of the TABULATE algorithm is given in Figure 2.","A noise-handling criterion is used to decide when an individual clause in a hypothesis is sufficiently accurate to be permanently retained. There are three possible outcomes in a refinement: 1) the current clause satisfies the noise-handling criterion and is simply returned (nextj is set to empty), 2) the current clause does not satisfy the noise-handling criteria and all possible refinements are returned (neztj is set to the refined clause), and 3) the current clause does not satisfy the noise-handling criterion but there are no further refinements (neztj is set to fai O. If the refinement is a new clause, clauses in the current theory subs-reed by it are removed. Otherwise, it is a specialization of an existing clause. Positive examples that are not covered by the resulting theory, due to specializing the clause, are added back into theory as individual clauses. Hence, the theory is always maintained complete (i.e. covering all positive examples). These final steps are performed in the Complete procedure.","The termination criterion checks for two conditions. The first is satisfied if the next search queue does not improve the sum of the metric score over all hypotheses in the queue. Second, there is no clause currently being built for each theory in the search queue and the last finished clause of each theory satisfies the noise-handling criterion. Finally, a committee of hypotheses found by the algorithm is returned. 3.2 Compression and Accuracy The goal of the search is to find accurate and yet simple hypotheses. We measure accuracy using the m-estimate (Cestnik, 1990), a smoothed measure of accuracy on the training data which in the case of a two-class problem is defined as:","accuracy(H) s + m. p+ = (1) n ,-I- rrt where s is the n-tuber of positive examples covered by the hypothesis H, n is the total number of examples covered, p+ is the prior probability of the class (9, and m is a smooth-ing parameter.","We measure theory complexity using a metric slmi]ar to that introduced in (Muggleton and Buntine, 1988).

The first is the U.S. Geography domain. The database contains about 800 facts about U.S. states like population, area, capital city, neighboring states, major rivers, major cities, and so on. A hand-crafted parser, GEOBASE was previously constructed for this domain as a demo product for Turbo Prolog. The second application is the restaurant query system illustrated in Figure 1. The database contains information about thousands of restaurants in Northern California, including the name of the restaurant, its location, its specialty, and a guide-book rating. The third domain consists of a set of 300 computer-related jobs automatically extracted from postings to the USENET newsgroup austin.jobs. The database contalus the following information: the job title, the company, the recruiter, the location, the salary, the languages and platforms used, and required or desired years of experience and degrees. 5.2 Experimental Design The geography corpus contains 560 questions. Approximately 100 of these were collected from a log of questions submitted to the web site and the rest were collected in studies in-volving students in undergraduate classes at our university. We also included results for the subset of 250 sentences originally used in the experiments reported in (Zelle and Mooney, 1996). The remaining questions were specificaUy collected to be more complex than the original 250, and generally require one or more meta-predicates. The restaurant corpus contaln~ 250 questions automatically generated from a hand-built grammar Constructed to reflect typical queries in this domain. The job corpus contains 400 questions automatically generated in a similar fashion. The beam width for TABULATE was set~ to five for all the domains. The deterministic parser used only the best hypothesis found. The experiments were conducted using 10-fold cross validation.","For each domain, the average recall (a.k.a. accuracy) and precision of the parser on disjoint test data are reported where: of correct queries produced Recall =","of test sentences","Precision = # of correct queries produced # of complete parses produced\" A complete parse is one which contains an executable query (which could be incorrect). A query is considered correct if it produces the same answer set as the gold-standard query supplied with the corpus. 5.3 Results The results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 3. By switching from deterministic to probabilistic parsing, the system increased the number of correct queries it produced. Recall increases almost monotonically with parsing beam width in most of the domains. I_mprovement is most apparent in the Jobs do-maln where probabilistic parsing signiBcantly outperformed the deterministic system (80% vs 68%). However, using a beam width of one (and thus the probabilistic parser picks only the best action) results in worse performance than using the original purely logic-based determlni~tic parser. This suggests that the probability esitmates could be improved since overall they are not indicating the single best action as well as a non-probabilistic approach. Precision of the system decreased with beam width, but not signi~cantly except for the larger Geography corpus. Since the system conducts a more extensive search for a complete parse, it risks increasing the number of incorrect as well as correct parses. The importance of recall vs. precision depends on the relative cost of providing an incorrect answer versus no answer at all. Individual applications may require emphasizing one or the other.","All of the experiments were run on a 167MHz UltraSparc work station under Sicstus Prolog. Although results on the parsing time of the different systems are not formally reported here, it was noted that the difference between using a beam width of three and the original system was less than two seconds in all domains but increased to a~r0und twenty seconds when using a beam width of twelve. However, the current Prolog implementation is not highly optimized. 139 Parsers \\ Corpora Geo250 Geo560 Jobs400 Rest250 Prob-Parser(12) Prob-Parser(8) Prob-Parser(5) Prob-Parser(3) Prob-Parser(1)","TABULATE Original CHILL","Hand-Built Parser","R P 80.40 88.16 79.60 86.90 78.40 87.11 77.60 87.39 67.60 90.37 75.60 92.65 68.50 97.65 56.00 96.40","R P 71.61 78.94 71.07 79.76 70.00 79.51 69.11 79.30 62.86 82.05 69.29 89.81","I~ P 80.50 86.56 78.75 86.54 74.25 86.59 70.50 87.31 34.25 85.63 68.50 87.54","R P 99.20 99.60 99.20 99.60 99.20 99.60 99.20 99.60 99.20 99.60 99.20 99.60 Table 1: Results For All Domains: R = % Recall and P = % Precision.

As a result, the recall did not always improve dramatically by using a larger beam width. Domain factors possibly affecting the performance are the quality of the lexicon, the relative amount of data available for calculat-ing probability estimates, and the problem of '~parser incompleteness\" with respect to the test data (i.e. there is not a path from a sentence to a correct query which happens when '7 = 0). The performance of all systems were basically equivalent in the restaurant domain, where they were near perfect in both recall and precision. This is because this corpus is relatively easier given the restricted range of possible questions due to the limited information available about each restaurant. The systems achieved > 90% in recall and precision given only roughly 30% of the training data in this domain. Finally, GEOBASE perfomed the worst on the original geography queries, since it is difficult to hand-crat~ a parser that handles a sn~cient variety of questions. 6 Conclusion A probabilistic framework for semantic shift-reduce parsing was presented. A new ILP learning system was also introduced which learns multiple hypotheses. These two techniques were integrated to learn semantic parsers for building NLI's to on|ine databases. Experimental results were presented that demonstrate that such an approach outperforms a purely logical approach in terms of the accuracy of the learned parser. 7 Ack~nowledgements This research was supported by a grant from the Daimler-Chrysler Research and Technology Center and by the National Science Foundation under grant n~I-9704943. 140 References","K.
