We use a simple genetic algorithm (GA) for this problem on two typical tasks in natural language processing: morphological synthesis and unknown word tagging. We find that GA feature selection always significantly outperforms the MBLP variant without selection and that feature ordering and weighting with CA significantly outperforms a situation where no weighting is used. However, GA selection does not significantly do better than simple iterative feature selection methods, and GA weighting and ordering reach only similar performance as current information-theoretic feature weighting methods. 1 Memory-Based Language","Processing Memory-Based Language Processing (Daelemans, van den Bosch, and Zavrel, 1999) is based on the idea that language acquisition should be seen as the incremental storage of exemplars of specific tasks, and language processing as analogical reasoning on the basis of these stored exemplars. These exemplars take the form of a vector of, typically, nominal features, describing a linguistic problem and its context, and an associated class symbol representing the solution to the problem.

The populations were evolved for a maximum of 200 generations or stopped when no change had occurred for over 50 generations. Parameter settings for the genetic algorithm were kept constant: a two-point crossover probability of 0.85, a mutation rate of 0.006, an elitist replacement strategy, and tournament selection. 2.1 Data The first task 3 we consider is prediction of what diminutive suffix a Dutch noun should take on the basis of its form. There are five different possible suffix forms (the classes). There are 12 features which contain information (stress and segmental information) about the structure of the last three syllables of a noun. The data set contains 3949 such instances. The second data set 4 is larger and contains 65275 instances, the task we consider here is part-of-speech (morpho-syntactic category) tagging of unknown words. The features used here are the coded POS-tags of two words before and two words after the focus word to be tagged, the","3Data from the CELEX lexical data base, available on CD-ROM from the LDC,"]},{"title":"http://ldc.upenn,","paragraphs":["edu. 4This dataset is based on the TOSCA tagged LOB","corpus of English. last three letters of the focus word, and information on hyphenation and capitalisation. There are 111 possible classes (part of speech tags) to predict. 2.2 Method We have used 10-fold-cross-validation in all experiments. Because the wrapper methods get their evaluation feedback directly from accuracy measurements on the data, we further split the trainfile for each fold into 2/3 sub-trainset and a 1/3 validation set. The settings obtained by this are then tested on the test set of that fold. 2,3 Results In Table 1 we show the results of our experiments (average accuracy and standard devia-tion over ten folds).

The different values for crossover ranged from 0.65 to 0.95, in steps of 0.05. The effect of changing crossover and mutation probabilities was tested for IBl-IG+GA-selection, for IB1 with CA weighting, for IGTREE+GA-selection, and for IGTREE with GA-weight settings. These experiments show considerable fluctua-tion in accuracy within the tested range, but different parameter settings could also yield same results although they were far apart in value. Some settings achieved a particularly high accuracy in this training regime (e.g. crossover: 0.75, mutation: 0.009). However, when we used these in the ten-fold cv setup of our main experiments, this gave a mean score of 97.4 (± 0.9) for IBi-IG with CA-selection and a mean score of 97.1 (± 1.1) for IGTREE with GA-selection. These accuracies are similar to those achieved with our default parameter settings. 2.5 Discussion Feature selection on the morphology task shows a significant increase in performance accuracy, whereas on the unknown words task the differences are less outspoken. To get some insight into this phenomenon, we looked at the average probabilities of the features that were left out by the evolutionary algorithm and their average weights.","On the morphology task this reveals that nucleus and coda of the last syllable are highly relevant, they are always included. The onset of all three syllables is always left out. Further, in all partitions the nucleus and coda of the second syllable are left out. 6 For part-of-speech tagging of unknown words all features appear to be more or less equally relevant. Over the ten partitions, either no omission is suggested at all, or the features that carry the pos-tag of n-2 word before and the n+2 word after the focus word are deleted. This is comparable to reducing the context window of this classification task to one word before and one after the focus. The fact that all features seem to contribute to the classification when doing POS-tagging (making selection irrelevant) could also explain why the IGTREE algorithm seems to benefit less from the feature orders suggested and why the non-weighted approach IB1 already has a high score on the tagging task. The IGTREE algorithm is more suited for problems where the features can be ordered in a straightforward way because they have significantly different relevance. 3 Conclusions and Related Research The issue of feature-relevance assignment is well-documented in the machine learning literature. Excellent comparative surveys are (Wettschereck, Aha, and Mohri, 1997) and (Wettschereck and Aha, 1995) or (Blum and Langley, 1997). Feature subset selection by means of evolutionary algorithms was in-vestigated by Skalak (1994), Vafaie and de Jong (1992), and Yang and Honavar (1997). Other work deals with evolutionary approaches for continuous feature weight assignment such as Wilson and Martinez (1996), or Punch and Goodman (1993).","The conclusions from these papers are in agreement with our findings on the natural language data, suggesting that feature selection and weighting with GA's significantly outperform non-weighted approaches. Feature selection generally improves accuracy with a reduc-","6This fits in with current theory about this morphological process (e.g. Trommelen (1983), Daelemans et al. (1997)). 105 tion in the number of features used. However, we have found no results (on these particular data) that indicate an advantage of evolutionary feature selection approach over the more classical iterative methods. Our experiments further show that there is no evidence that GA weighting is in general competitive with simple filter methods such as gain ratio. Possibly, a parameter setting for the GA could be found that gives better results, but searching for such an optimal parameter setting is at present computationally unfeasible for typical natural language processing problems.","References","Aha, D., D.
