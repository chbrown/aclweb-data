A set of automatic WSD techniques is described for linking Korean words collected from a bilingual MRD to English WordNet synsets. We will show how individual linking provided by each WSD method is then combined to produce a Korean WordNet for nouns. 1 Introduction","There is no doubt on the increasing importance of using wide coverage ontologies for NLP tasks especially for information retrieval and cross-language information retrieval. While these ontologies exist in English, there are very few available wide range ontologies for other languages. Manual construction of the ontology by experts is the most reliable technique but is costly and highly time-consuming. This is the reason for many researchers having focused on massive acquisition of lexical knowledge and semantic information from pre-existing lexical resources as automatically as possible.","This paper presents a novel approach for automatic WordNet mapping using word sense disambiguafion. The method has been applied to link Korean words from a bilingual dictionary to English WordNet synsets.","To clarify the description, an example is given. To link the first sense of Korean word \"gwan-mog\" to WordNet synset, we employ a bilingual Korean-English dictionary. The first sense of 'gwan-mog' has 'bush' as a translation in English and 'bush' has five synsets in WordNet. Therefore the first sense of 'gwan-mog\" has five candidate synsets. Somehow we decide a synset {shrub, bush} among five candidate synsets and link the sense of 'gwan-mog' to this synset.","As seen from this example, when we link the senses of Korean words to WordNet synsets, there are semantic ambiguities. To remove the ambiguities we develop new word sense disambiguation heuristics and automatic mapping method to construct Korean WordNet based on the existing English WordNet.","This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe multiple heuristics for word sense disambiguation for sense linking. In section 3, we explain the method of combination for these heuristics. Section 4 presents some experiment results, and section 5 will discuss some related researches. Finally we draw some conclusions and future researches in section 6. The automatic mapping-based Korean WordNet plays a natural Korean-English bilingual thesaurus, so it will be directly applied to Korean-English cross-lingual information retrieval as well as Korean monolingual information retrieval. 2 Multiple heuristics for word sense disambiguation","As the mapping method described in this paper has been developed for combining multiple individual solutions, each single heuristic must be seen as a container for some part of the linguistic knowledge needed to disarnbiguate the * This research was supported by KOSEF special purpose basic research (1997.9- 2000.8 #970-1020-301-3) Corresponding author 142 ambiguous WordNet synsets. Therefore, not a single heuristic is suitable to all Korean words collected from a bilingual dictionary. We will describe each individual WSD (word sense disambiguation) heuristic for Korean word mapping into corresponding English senses.","Korean word English word WordNet synset wsl = WS","2 ...","W$ n Figure 1: Word-to-Concept Association","Figure 1 shows the Korean word to WordNet synset association.

Each internal node of a decision tree is a choice point, dividing an individual method into ranges of possible values. Each leaf node is labeled with a classification (linking or disc~ding). The most popular method of decision tree induction, employed here, is C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).","Figure 4 shows a training phase in decision ,tree based combination method. In the training phase, the candidate synset ws k of a Korean word is manually classified as linking or discarding and get assigned scores by each heuristic. A training data set is constructed by these scores and manual classification. The training data set is used to optimize a model for combining heuristics.","//~ Heur,st,c 3 ~ ~K ~ Heuristic 4 ~ ('~'~\"~"]},{"title":"\\ 1 x -H Ig2 l I Oeoi oo","paragraphs":["[ Classfflcatzon I ~ -~\" [ tree learning Figure 4: Training phase Heuristic 2 Heuristic 3","n L=nklng or HeunsUc 4 Discarding Heunstlc 5 Heunst=c 6 Figure 5: Mapping phase","Figure 5 shows a mapping phase.

The synset classified as linking is linked to the corresponding Korean word. 4 Evaluation","In this section, we evaluate the performance of each six heuristics as well as the combination method. To evaluate the performance of WordNet mapping, the candidate synsets of 3260 senses of Korean words in bilingual dictionary was manually classified as linking or discarding.","We define 'precision' as the proportion of correctly linked senses of Korean words to all the linked senses of Korean words in a test set. We also define 'coverage' as the proportion of linked senses of Korean words to all the senses of Korean words in a test set.","Table 1 contains the results for each heuristic evaluated individually against the manually classified data. The test set here consists of the 3260 manually classified senses.","In general, the results of each heuristic seem to be poor, but are always better than the random choice baseline. The best heuristic according to 145 the precision is the maximum similarity heuristic. But it was applied to only 59.51% of 3260 senses of Korean words. The results of each heuristic are better than the random mapping, with a statistically significance at the 99% level.

This process is repeated nine times using each of the other nine parts as a validation set.","Table 2 shows the results of the other trials of the combination of all the heuristics. Summing is a way to simply sum all the scores of each heuristic. Then the candidate synset which has the highest summation of the scores is selected. Logistic regression, as described in (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989), is a popular technique for binary classification. This technique applies an inverse logit function and employs the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm. This technique determines the weight of each heuristic.","With the combination of the heuristics using summing, we obtained an improvement over maximum similarity heuristic (heuristic 1) of 9%, maintaining a coverage 100%. The decision tree is able to correctly map 93.59% of the senses of Korean words in bilingual dictionary, maintaining a coverage 77.12%.","Applying the decision tree to combine all the heuristics for all Korean words in bilingual dictionary, we obtain a preliminary version of the Korean WordNet containing 21654 senses of 17696 Korean nouns with an accuracy of 93.59% (-2-0.84% with 99% confidence). 5 Related works","Several attempts have been performed to automatically produce multilingual ontologies. (Knight & Luk 1994) focuses on the construction of Sensus, a large knowledge base for supporting the Pangloss Machine Translation system, merging ontologies (ONTOS and UpperModel) and WordNet with monolingual and bilingual dictionaries. (Okumura & Hovy 1994) describes a semi-automatic method for associating a Japanese lexicon to an ontology using a Japanese/English bilingual dictionary as a 'bridge'. Several lexical resources and techniques are combined in (Atserias et al., 1997) to map Spanish words from a bilingual dictionary to WordNet. In (Farreres et al., 1998), use of a taxonomic structure derived from a monolingual MRD is proposed as an aid to the mapping process.","This research is contrasted that it utilized bilingual dictionary to build monolingual thesaurus based on the existing popular lexical resources and used the combination of multiple unsupervided WSD heuristics. 6 Conclusion","This paper has explored the automatic construction of a Korean WordNet from pre-existing lexical resources - English wordNet and Korean/English bilingual dictionary. We presented several techniques for word sense disambiguation and their application to disambiguate the translations in bilingual dictionary. We obtained a preliminary version of the Korean WordNet containing 21654 senses of 17696 Korean nouns. In a series of experiments, we observed that the accuracy of mapping is over 90%.
