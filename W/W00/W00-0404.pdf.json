Most of the summarization work has focused on a single document. Tiffs paper focuses on multi-document summarization: broadcast news documents about the same topic. One of the major problems in the multi-document summarization task is how to identify differences and similza'ities across documents. This can be interpreted as a question of how to make a clear distinction between an e~ent mM a topic in docu= meats. Here, an event is the subject of a document itself, i.e. a writer wants to express, in other words, notions of who, what, where, when. why and how in a document. On the other hand, a topic in this paper is some unique thing that happens at some specific time and place, and the unavoidable consequences. It'becomes background among documents. For example, in the documents of :Kobe Japan quake', the event includes early reports of damage, location and nature of quake, rescue efforts, consequences of the quake, a~ld on-site reports, while the topic is Kobe Japaa~ quake. The well-known past experience from IR ~ that notions of who, what, where, when, why and how may not make a great contribution to the topic detection and tracking task (Allan and Papka, 1998) causes this fact, i.e. a topic and an event are different from each other 1 .","1 Some topic words can also be an event. Fbr instance: in the document shown in Figure 1: 'Japan: and =quake' are topic words and also event words in the document. However, we regarded these words as a topic, i.e. not be an event.","In this paper: we propose a. method fi)r extracting key paragraph for multi-document smnmariza-tion based on distinction between a topic and an event. We use a silnple criterion called domain dependency of words as a solution and present how the i.dea of domain dependency of words can be utilized effectively to identify a topic and an event: and thus allow multi-document summarization.","The basic idea of our approach is that whether a word appeared in a document is a topic (an event) or not, depends on the domain to which the document belongs. Let us take a look at the following document from the TDT1 corpus. (1-2) Two Americans known dead in Japan quake","1. The number of [Americans] known to have been killed in Tuesday's earthquake in Japan has risen to two, the [State] [Department] said Thursday.","2. The first was named Wednesday as Voni Lynn ~Vong~ a teacher from California. [State I [Department] spokswoman Christine Shelly declined to name the second: saying formalities of notifying the family had not been completed.","3. With the death toll still mounting, at least 4:000 people were killed in the earthquake which devastated the Japanese city of Kobe.","4. [U.S.] diplomats were trying to locate the sevcrM thousand-strong [U.S.] community in the area: and some [Americans] who had been made homeless were found shelter in the [U.S.] consulate there: which was only lightly damaged in the quake.","5. Shelly said an emergency [State] [Department] telephone number in Washington to provide information about private [American] citizens in Japan had received over 6,000 calls, more than half ot'Th-'e'm seeking direct assistance.","6. The Pentagon has agreed to send 57:000 blankets to Japan and [U.S.] ambassador to Tokyo ~Valter Mondale has donated a $25,000 discretionary fund for emergencies to the Japanese Red Cross, Shelly said.","7. Japan has also agreed to a visit by a team of [U.S.] experts headed by Richard Witt, national director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Figure 1: The document titled 'Two Americans l~lown dead in Japan quake' Figure I is the document whose topic is 'Kobe Japan quake', and the subject of the document (event"]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["words) is 'Two Americans known dead in Japan quake'. Underlined words denote a topic, and the words marked with '[ ]' are events. '1,,,7' of Figure 1 is paragraph id. Like Lulm's technique of keyword extraction, our method assumes that an event associated with a document appears throughout parm graphs (Luhn, 1958), but a topic does not. This is because an event is the subject of a document itself. while a topic is an event, along with all directly related events. In Figure 1, event words 'Americans' and 'U.S.', for instance, appears across paragraphs, while a topic word, for example, 'Kobe' appears only the third paragraph. Let us consider further a broad coverage domain which consists of a small number of sanaple news documents about the same topic, 'Kobe Japan quake'. Figure 2 and 3 are documents with 'Kobe Japan quake'. (l-l) Quake collapses buildings in central Japan","1. At lea.~t two people died and dozens were injured when a powerful earthquake rolled through central Japan Tue..~lay morning, collapsing buildings and setting off fires in the cities of Kobe and Osaka.","2. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the earthquake, which measured 7.2 on the open-ended Richter scale: rmnbled across Honshu Island from the Pacific Ocean to the Japan Sea. Figure 2: The document titled 'Quake collapses buildings in central Japan' (1-3) Kobe quake leaves questions about medical system","1. The earthquake that devastated Kobe in January raised serious questions about the efficiency of Japan's emergency medical system, a government report released on Tuesday said.","2. 'The earthquake exposed many i~ues in terms of quantity, quality, promptness and efficiency of Japan's medical care in time of disaster,' the report on-'ff'h-~alth and welfare said. Figure 3: The document titled 'Kobe quake leaves questions about medical system' Underlined words in Figure 2 and 3 show the topic of these documents. In these two documents, :Kobe' which is a topic appears in eveD\" document, while 'Americans' and 'U.S.' which are events of the document shown in Figure 1, does not appear. Our technique for making the distinction between a topic and an event explicitly exploits this feature of the domain dependency of words: how strongly a word features a given set of data.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides domain dependency of words which is used to identify a topic and an event for broadcast news documents. We then present a method for extracting topic and event words: and describe a paragraph-based summarization algorithm using the result of topic and event extraction. Finally~ we report some experiments using the TDT1 corpus which has been developed by the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) Pilot Study (Allan and Carbonell, 1998) with a discussion of evaluation. 2 Domain Dependency of Words The domain dependency of words that how strongly a word features a given set of data (documents) contributes to event extraction, as we previously reported (Fukumoto et al.: 1997). In the study, we hypothesi~d that the articles from the Wall Street Journal corpus can be structured by three levels, i.e. Domain, Article and Paragraph. It'a word is nil event in a given article, it satisfies the two conditions: (1) The dispersion value of the word in the Paragraph level is smaller than that of the Art.iele, since the .word appears throughout paragr~q~hs in the Paragraph level rather than articles in the Article level. (2) The dispersion value of the word in the Article is smaller than that of the Domain, as the word appears across articles rather than domains.","However, ~here are two problems to adapt it to multl-document summarization task. The first is that the method extracts only events in the document. Because the goal of the study is to summarize a single document, and thus there is no answer to the question of how to identi~' differences and similarities across documents. The second is that the performance of the method greatly depends on the structure of a given data itself. Like the Wall Street Journal corpus, (i) if a given data caal be structured by three levels, Paragraph, Article and Domain, each of which consists of several paragraphs, articles and domains, respectively, aaad (ii) if Domain consists of different subject domains, such as 'aerospace', 'environment' and 'stock market', the method can be done with satisfactoD' accuracy. However, there is no guarantee to make such an appropriate structure from a given set of documents in the multi-document summarization task.","The purpose of this paper is to define domain dependency of words for a number of sample documents about the same topic, and thus for multi-document summarization task. Figure 4 illustrates the structure of broadcast news documents which have been developed by the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) Pilot Study (Allan and Carbonell, 1998). It consists of two levels, Paragraph and Document. In Document level, there is a small number of sample news documents about the same topic. These documents are arranged in chronological order such as, '(l-l) Quake collapses buildings in central ,Japan (Figure 2)', '(1-2) Two Americans known dead in Japan quake (Figure 1)' and '(1-3) gobe quake leaves questions about medical system (Figure 3)'.

Our method assumes that aal event associated with a document appears across paragraphs, but a topic word does not. Then, we use domain dependency of words to extract event and topic words in document (1-2). Domain dependency of words is a measure showing how greatly each word features a given set of data.","In Figure 4.. let 'C)', 'A' and 'x' denote a topicl an event and a general word in document (1-2), respectively. We recall the example shown in Figure 1. 'A', for instance, 'U.S.' appears across paragraphs. However, in the Document level, :A' frequently appears in document, (1-2) itself. On the basis of this example, we hypothesize that if word i is an event, it\"satisfies the following condition:","[1] Word i greatly depends on a particular document in the Document level rather than a particular paragraph in the Paragraph. Next, we turn to identi~\" the remains (words) wit.h a topic, or a general word. In Figure 5; a topic of documents (1-1) ~ (1-3), for instance, :Kobe' aPpears in a particular paragraph in each level of Paragraphl, Paragraph2 and Paragraph3. Here, (1-1), (1-2) and (1-3) corresponds to Paragraph1, Paragraph2 and Paragraph3, respectively. On the other hand, in Document level, a topic frequently appears acros.~ documents.

This can be broken down into two observations: (i) whether a word appears across paragraphs (documents), (it) whether or not a word appears frequently. We represented the former by using dispersion value, and the latter by deviation value. Topic and event words are extracted by using these values.","The first step to extract topic and event words is to assign weight to the individual word in a document. We applied TF*IDF to each level of the Document and Paragraph, i.e. Paragraphl, Paragraph2 and Paragraph3.","N Wdit = TFdit * log Ndt (1) Wdit in formula (1) is TF*IDF of term t in the i-th document.

Basically, paragraphs which include not only event words but also topic words are considered to be significant paragraphs. The basic algorithm works as follows: 1. For each document: extract topic and event words. 2. Determine the paragraph weights for all paragraphs in the documents:","(a) Compute the sum of topic weights over the total number of topic words for each paragraph.","(b) Compute the sum of event weights over the total number of event words for each paragraph.

First, we have not found an existing collection of summaries of multiple documents. Second, the maamal effort needed to judge system output is far more extensive than for single document summarization. Consequently, we focused on the TDT1 corpus. This is because (i) events have been defined to support the TDT study effort, (ii) it was completely annotated with respect to these events (Allan and Carbonell, 1997). Therefore, we do not need the manual effort to collect documents which discuss about the target event.","We report the results of three experiments.

Distinction between a topic and an event improved the results of key paragraph extraction, as our method consistently outperforms the method which used only the extracted event words (see Figure 7)."]},{"title":"37","paragraphs":["6 Related Work The majority of techniques for summarization fall within two broad categories: Those that rely on template instantiation and those that rely on passage extraction.","Work in the former approach is the DARPA-sponsored TIPSTER program and, in particular, the message understanding conferences hag provided fer-tile groined for such work, by placing the emphasis of docunmnt analysis to the identification and extraction of certain core entities and facts in a document, while work on template-driven, knowledge. based summarization to date is hardly domain or genre-independent (Boguraev and Kennedy. 1997).","The alternative approach largely escapes this constraint, by viewing the task as one of identi~,ing certain passages(typically sentences) which, by some metric, are deemed to be the most representative, of the document's content. A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text: statistical techniques based oll word distribution (Kupiec et al., 1995), (Zechner, 1996), (Salton et al., 1991), (Teufell and Moens, 1997), symbolic techniques based on discourse structure (Marcu, 1997) and semantic relations between words (Barzil~v and Elhadad, 1997). All of their results demonstrate that passage extraction techniques are a useful first step in document summarization, although most of them have focused on a single document.","Some researchers have started to apply a single-document summarization technique to multi-document. Stein et. al. proposed a method for summarizing multi-document using single-document summarizer (Stralkowsik et al., 1998), (Stralkowski et al.. 1999). Their method first summarizes each document of multi-document, then groups the summaries in clusters and finally, orders these summaries in a logical way (Stein et al., 1999). Their technique seems sensible. However, as she admits, (i) the order the information should not only depend on topic covered, (ii) background information that helps clari~\" related information should be placed first. More seriously, as Barzilay and Mani claim, summarization of multiple documents requires information about similarities and differences across documents. Therefore it is difficult to identi~\" these information using a single-document summarizer technique (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997), (Barzilay et al., 1999).","A method proposed by Mani et. al. deal with the problem, i.e. they tried to detect the similarities and differences in information content among documents (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997). They used a spreading activation algorithm and graph match-ing in order to identify similarities and differences across documents. The output is presented as a set of paragraphs with similar and unique words highlighted.

One of the purpose of this study is to make a distinction between an event aald an event class using surprising features. Here event class features are broad news areas such as politics, death, destruction and ~,'~fare. The idea is considered to be necessary to obtain higti accuracy, while Allan claims that the surprising words do not provide a broad enough coverage to capture all documents on the event.","A more recent approach dealing with this problem is Barzilav et. al's approach (Barzilay et al., 1999). They used paraphrasing rules which are maaaually derived from the result of syntactic analysis to identify theme intersection and used language generation to reformulate them as a coherent, summary. While promising to obtain high accuracy: the result of summarization task has not been reported.","Like Mani and Barzil~,'s techniques, our approach focuses on the problem that how to identi~\" differences and similarities across documents, rather than the problem that how to form the actual sum-mar:,, (Sparck, 1993), (McKeown and Radev, 1995), (Radev and McKeown, 1998). However, while Barzilav's approach used paraphrasing rules to eliminate redmadancy in a summary, we proposed domain dependency of words to address robustness of the technique. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a method for extracting key paragraph for summarization based on distinction between a topic and an event. The results showed that the average accuracy was 68.1~ when we used the TDT1 corpus. TIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation (SUMMAC) proposed various methods for evaluating document summarization and tasks (Mani et al., 1999). Of these, participants submitted two summaries: a fixed-length summary limited to 10% of tile length of the source, and a summary which was not limited in length. Fu-ture work includes quantitative and qualitative evaluation. In addition, our method used single words rather thaaa phrases. These phrases, however, would be helpful to resolve ambiguity and reduce a lot of noise, i.e. yield much better accuracy. We plaal to apply our method to phrase-based topic and event extraction, then turn to focus on the problem that how to form the actual summary..
