University St. University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI 48109 radev@umi ch. edu Abstract We introduce CST (cross-document slructure theory), a paradigm for multi-document analysis. CST takes into aceount the rhetorical structure of clusters of related textual documents. We present a taxonomy of cross-document relationships. We argue that CST can be the basis for multi-document summarization guided by user preferences for summary length, information provenance, cross-source agreement, and chronological ordering of facts. 1 Introduction The Topic Detection and Tracking model (TDT) [Allan et al. 98] describes news events as they are reflected in news sources. First, many sources write on the same event and, second, the same source typically produces a number of accounts of the event over a period of time. Sixteen news stories related to the same event from six news sources over a two-hour time period are represented in Figure 1."]},{"title":"-i II I I I _ I ! I I, _1 I I _ I I I1!

In some cases, different sourees agree with each other, at other times, the information presented in them is contradictory. The same source sometimes adds new information as it becomes available and puts it in the context of what has already been discussed earlier. In other eases, to get a full picture of an event, one has to read stories from multiple sources as neither of them presents all relevant information. All these examples point to the existence of cross-document structure that is waiting to be exploited. Figure 2 illustrates how the same story can be told in several different ways.

CST assigns labels 74 such as subsumption, update, and elaboration to cross-document conceptual links. We argue that CST is essential for the analysis of contradiction, redundancy, and complementarity in related documents and for multi-document summarization (MDS). FoxNews: President Clinton announced Wednesday he will release funds to help New Englanders through the heating oil \"crisis\" and spoke on topics ranging from gun violence to his personal life and foreign policy. The president said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families who must rely on oil to heat their homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year. ABCN~s: President Clinton today ordered the release of millions of dollars in assistance for Northeastern families struggling with soaring fuel costs, saying Americans have together to help their fellow citizens in times of need.

CNN: Citing rising energy costs, President Clinton said Wednesday he is releasing $120 million in funds to help families buy home heating oil in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states. The president said lie decided the help was needed heeause steadily rising oil prices have slammed consumers dependent on home heating oil and have boosted the cost of,gasoline. MSNBC: AT A WASHINGTON, D.C. news conference, Clinton announced that he had ordered the release of the remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families in the Northeast hit hard by this year's cold weather and the soaring cost of home heating oil. Clinton said lie ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families who must rely on oil to heat their homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year. USA Today: President Clinton, saying too many families are being hurt by the soaring cost of heating their homes, announced Wednesday he will ask Congress for $600 million in emergency assistance to help people meet heating oil costs. He also released an additional $125 million for more immediate help to low-income families. NY Times: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 - President Clinton ordered the release today of another $125 million in government aid to help needy families pay the soaring costs of heating their homes this winter. The release, announced by Mr. Clinton at the start of a White House news conference this afternoon, comes only six days after the government made $130 million in home-heating aid available. Figure 2: Six different accounts of the same event 2 Related Work 2.1 Document structure Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann & Thompson 88, Mann 00] is a comprehensive theory of text organization. It is based on \"text coherence\", or the presence in \"earefuUy written text\" of unity that would not appear in random sequences of sentences. RST posits the existence of relations among sentences. Most relations consist of one or more nuclei (the central components of a rhetorical relation) and zero or more satellites (the supporting components of the relation). An example of an RST relation is evidence which is decomposed into a nuelens (a claim) and a satellite (text that supports the claim). RST is intentionally limited to single documents. With CST, we attempt to describe the rhetorical structure of sets of related documents. Unlike RST, CST cannot rely on the deliberateness of writing style. We can however make use of some observations of structure across documents which, while clearly not deliberate in the RST sense, can be quite predictable and useful. In a sense, CST associates a certain behavior to a \"collective document author\" (that is, the collectivity of all authors of the related documents). A pioneering study in the typology of links among documents is described in [Trigg 83, Trigg & Weiser 87]. Trigg introduces a taxonomy of link types across scientific papers. The 80 suggested link types such as citation, refutation, revision, equivalence, and comparison are grouped in two categories: Normal (inter-document links) and Commentary (deliberate cross-document links). While the taxonomy is quite exhaustive, it is by no means appropriate or intended for general domain texts (that is, other than scientific articles). 75 A large deal of research in the automatic induction of document and hyperdocument structure is due to Salton's group at Cornell [Salton et al. 91]. [Allan 96] presents a graph simplification technique for \"hyperlink typing\", that is, assigning link types from Trigg's list to links between sentences or paragraphs of a pair of documents. Allan tested his techniques on sets of very distinct articles (e.g. \"John F. Kennedy\" and \"United States of America\" from the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia). As the author himself admits, the evaluation in [Allan 96] is very weak and doesn't indicate to any extent whether the techniques actually achieve anything useful. More recently, [Salton et al. 97] introduced a technique for document structuring based on"]},{"title":"semantic hyperlinks","paragraphs":["(among pairs of paragraphs which are related by a lexieal similarity significantly higher than random).

The summarization techniques described in Salton et al.'s research are limited to single documents. One of the goals of CST is to extend the techniques set forth in Trigg, Salton, and Allan's work to cover sets of related documents in arbitrary domains. 2.2 Multi-document summarization SUMMONS [Radev & McKeown 98] is a knowledge-based multi-document summarization system, which produces summaries of a small number of news articles within the domain of terrorism. SUMMONS uses as input a set of semantic templates extracted by a message understanding system [Fisher et al. 96] and identifies some patterns in them such as chang e of perspective, contradiction, refinement, agreement, and elaboration. The techniques used in SUMMONS involved a large amount of knowledge engineering even for a relatively small domain of text (such as accounts of terrorist events) and is not directly suitable for domain-independent text analysis. The planning operators used in it present, however, the ideal first step towards CST. [Mani & Bloedorn 99] use similarities and differences among related news articles for MDS. They measure the effectiveness of their method in two scenarios: paragraph ahgnment across two articles and query-based information retrieval. None of these scenarios evaluates the generation of query-independent summaries of multiple articles in open domains.

The first stage, clustering, can be either query-independent (e.g., based on pure document 80 similarity [Allan et al. 98]) or based on a user query (in which case clusters will be the sets of documents returned by a search engine).

Its effect is to preserve only these nodes from the source MDG that are associated with the preferred cross-document links.

We are also currently building a system for automatic identification of relationships in document clusters as well as a library of summarization operators. User preferrenees are used to constrain the summarizers. For example, a user may prefer that in the event of same set of input documents contradiction, both sources of information should be represented in the summary. Another user may have preferences for a given source over all others and choose an operator which will only reflect his preferred source. We will facilitate the user's navigation in the space of all possible summarizers. By specifying their preferences, users will build their own summarizers and test them on a collection of documents and then refine them to fit their needs. 6.2 Conclusion We introduced a theory of cross-document structure based on inter-document relationships such as paraphrase, citation, attribution, modality, and development. We presented a taxonomy of cross-document links. We argued that a CST-based analysis of related documents can facilitate multi-document summarization. 82","References","James Allan. \"Automatic hypertext link typing\".
