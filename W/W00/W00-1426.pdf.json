We show how this constraint can be stated precisely, and present some counterexamples which seem acceptable even though they violate compatibility.

In the first stage, material is selected, perhaps from a knowledge base, and organized rhetorically. In the second stage, the rhetorical structure is realized by a text structure (or document structure), through which the material is distributed among sentences, paragraphs, vertical lists, and perhaps even diagrams. The RAtS (1999) proposal for a standard NLG architecture distinguishes tile outputs of these two phases by the data types l:l.hetRep (rhetorical representation) and DocRep (document representation).","We focus in this paper on the second stage of text planning -- the passage from RhetRep to DocRep. NLG researchers have addressed this issue in various ways, but everyone as-sumes some kind of structural compatibility between rhetorical structure and text structure. The most popular discourse framework in NLG is R ST (Mann a.nd Thompson. 1988). which makes the crucial distinction between nucleus, which is the most important part of a message, and satellite, which is the peripheral part of the message. Scott and Souza (1990) provide guidelines for the realisation of RST trees into a coherent text. One of them is to avoid dangling sentences, that is, to avoid putting \"information that is only weakly relevant to the message\" in a separate sentence because it will feel as if it has been introduced as an afterthought or as introducing a new topic which is then abruptly abandoned, disrupting the comprehensibility of the text. As an example, the authors provide the attributive satellite of an elaboration relation.","Marcu (1996), in order to build a valid text plan from a set of rhetorical assertions, uses the \"nuclearity principle\", that is the observa-tion in Mann and Thompson's framework that \"whenever two large text spans are connected through a rhetorical relation, that rhetorical relation holds also between the most important parts of the constituent spans\". Therefore, the resulting text plans are valid in the sense that they are isomorphic with one of the rhetorical structures that can be built from the rhetorical assertions using this nuclearity principle.","Our aim in this paper is to formulate more precisely a notion of structural compatibility which is necessary in order to describe the realisation of a RhetRep into various DocReps, and then .to discuss some examples (mostly taken from the domain of patient information leaflets) of apparently acceptable texts in which this no- .tion of compatibility is violated..:To discuss this issue clearly, an assmnption must be made about the kinds of information represented by rhetorical and text structure; we outline in section 2 the common assumption that these representations are trees, labelled respectively with rhetorical and textual categories, the rhetorical structure being unordered and the text struc-194 ture ordered. Section 3 then defines a notion of.structural compatibility that:is weaker than isomorphism; section 4 shows that we can find plausible counterexamples even to this weaker formulation, and discusses why these passages occur. Section 5 discusses some implications for NLG, and finally, section 6 raises further important issues."]},{"title":"2 Rhetorical structure and text structure","paragraphs":["To distinguish clearly between FthetRep and DocRep, we need to define the kinds of information that should be included in the two representations. Bateman and Rondhius (1997) compare several approaches to rhetorical representation, citing in particular RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (Asher, 1993). These approaches share the idea that rhetorical representations are composed of propositions linked by rhetorical relations; SDRT includes as well the logical apparatus of DRT, thus covering notions like necessity and logical scope which are missing from RST. For the most part, NLG applications have used the RST framework, adapted in various ways; the most common representation, proposed also as the RAGS standard, is that of a tree in which terminal nodes represent elementary propositions, while non-terminal nodes represent rhetorical relationships. This representation, proposed for example by Scott and Souza (1990), is illustrated by figure 1, which might be realized by the following passage:","(1) Elixir occasionally provokes a mild allergic reaction B, because it contains gestodene C. However, Elixir has no serious side-effects A .","Assuming an RST-based framework, an important issue is whether the rhetorical represen- . tation should already.imply a linear order. Most researchers have followed Scott and Souza in assuming that linear order should be left unspecified; it is during the transition to the document representation that the material is distributed among linguistic units (or perhaps diagrams, in a multimedia document) arranged in a specific order. Thus the cause relation in figure 1. for example, could be realized with nucleus first, or satellite first, or satellite embedded within nucleus:"]},{"title":"not(serious-side -e ffe~ts(elixir)) NU~EUS S,~LLITE B C possible(allergic-reaction(elixir)) contain(elixir, gestodene)","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Rhetorical representation","(2a) Elixir occasionally provokes a mild allergic reaction B, because it contains gestodene c.","(2b) Because it contains gestodene C, Elixir occasionally provokes a mild allergic reaction B.","(2c) Elixir, because it contains gestodene C, occasionally provokes a mild allergic reaction B .","In the RAGS proposal, which aims to extract a useful common approach from current work in NLG, the DocRep comprises an ordered tree corresponding roughly to the 'logical markup' in notations like HTML and LaTeX. More precisely, a distinction is made between abstract and concrete levels of representation, where the abstract representation corresponds to logical markup (e.g., concepts like 'paragraph' and :emphasis'), while the concrete representation also covers graphical markup (concepts like ~vertical space' and 'bold face'). In terms of this distinction, it is the AbsDocRep that is specified during text planning; graphical markup can be deferred to a later formatting stage.","Figure 2 shows two alternative document representations expressing the rhetorical content in figure 1.

A given rhetorical representation can be expressed by a variety of different document representations, in which the propositions occur in different orders, and in different text-category configurations, and the rhetorical relations are expressed by different connectives. This formulation of the problem raises an obvious question: how can we characterize the set of document representations that adequately realize a given rhetorical representation? Elsewhere (Power, 2000), we have argued that an adequate realization must meet three conditions:","Correct content: All propositions and nmst be expressed. rhetorical relations","Well-formed structure: General formation rules for document structure must be respected (e.g. a text-sentence cannot contain a paragraph, unless tile paragraph is indented).","Structural compatibility: The docmnent representation nmst organize the propositions in a way that is compatible with their organization in rhetorical structure. 196 The first two conditions are relatively straightforward, but what is meant,exactly .by 'structural compatibility'?","Assuming that we are comparing two trees, the strongest notion of compatibility is isomorphism, which can be defined for our purposes as follows: DocRep is isomorphic with RhetRep if they group the elementary propositions in exactly the same way. More formally, every set of propositions that is dominated by a node in DocRep should be dominated by a node in RhetRep, and vice-versa. Under this definition, the rhetorical representation in figure 1 is isomorphic with the document representation in figure 2a, but not with that in figure 2b:","* Proceeding top-down and left-to-right, the five nodes in figure 1 dominate the proposition sets {A,B, C}, {A}, {S,C}, {B}, and"]},{"title":"{c}.","paragraphs":["o Ignoring nodes that express discourse connectives, the nodes in figure 2a dominate the proposition sets {A,B,C}, {B,C}, {B}, {C} (twice), and {A} (twice). These are exactly the same sets that were obtained for figure 1.","* Tile corresponding sets for figure 2b are {A,B,C}, {C}, {B} (twice), and {A} (twice). Since the set {B,C} is missing from this list, there is a grouping in figure 1 that is not realized in figure 2b, so these representations are not isomorphic. Since structures like figure 2b are common, isotnorphism seems too strong a constraint; we have therefore proposed (Power, 2000) the following weaker notion of compatibility: DocRep is compatible with RhetRep if every grouping of the elementary propositions in Docgep is also found in R.hetRep.

Looking through our corpus of patient information leaflets, we have noticed some exceptions, especially in passages giving conditional instructions:","(4) If you forget to take your tablet A, take another as soon as you remember B or wait until it is time to take your next dose C. Then go on as before D. From the point of view of document structure, this passage is a paragraph comprising two text-sentences: thns the proposition D is separated from the other three propositions, which are grouped in tile .first sentence. However, rhetorically speaking, D belongs to the consequent of the conditional: it is the final step of the plan that should be activated .if_the patient forgets to take a dose (figure 3). Compatibility is violated because tile DocRep contains a node (the first text-sentence) dominating the proposition set {A, B, C}. which is not dominated by any node in figure 3.","Such examples might be explained as the result of loose punctuation or layout, perhal)S 197 through imitation of the patterns of conversa-tion, in which extra:.materi~! is_often ~tagged. on-as an afterthought. Thus proposition D remains grouped with B and C -- they occur consecutively -- but through a minor relaxation of normal punctuation it has been separated by a full-stop rather than a comma. However, this explanation fails to cover variations of the example in which the propositions in the consequent are not realized consecutively in the DocRep:","(5) Consult your doctor immediately A if a rash develops B. It might become seriously infected C.","In this example, A must be grouped rhetorically with C rather than with B, unless we take the radical step of allowing rhetorical structure to contradict logical structure. The proposition C cannot be logically conjoined with the conditional because it contains a hypothetical discourse referent (the rash) that is bound to the antecedent, and is therefore inaccessible outside the conditional.","If passages of this kind are not artifacts of loose punctuation, why do they occur? A plausible reason, we suggest, is that some complex rhetorical patterns cannot easily be realized in a way that maintains structural compatibility, usually because text-clauses are overloaded. Conditionals are especially prone to this problem because the only common discourse connective ('if') is a subordinating conjunction which can only link spans within a syntactic sentence (and thus within a text-clause). If either the antecedent or the consequent is complex, the author is faced with a tricky problem. We have found examples in patient information leaflets of conditional sentences so long that they are ahnost incomprehensible. More skilled authors, however, succeed in presenting the material clearly either by using layout (e.g., a complex antecedent is presented as an indented list), or by a trick of rhetorical reorganization that we will call"]},{"title":"eztraposition.","paragraphs":["It is this trick that introduces an incompatibility between RhetRep and DocRep.","Extraposition typically occurs when a rhetorical representation R contains a complex embedded constituent C.

The RAGS proposal (1999) allows for rhetorical transformations through a distinction between abstract and concrete rhetorical representations. The abstract representation AbsRhetRep expresses the rhetorical content of the underlying message, while the concrete RhetRep expresses the rhetorical structure directly realized in the text and corresponds to the representation used by Scott and Souza (1990) to discuss textual realisation.

For instance, suppose that we try extraposing the elaboration of a satellite when the main relation is not a conditional, but a concession. The following passages show two texts that might result, but in this case the second version sounds anomalous: even if they are not grouped together in the DocRep, the satellite and its elaboration at least need to be consecutive.","(10a) You should not stop taking Elixir, even though you might experience some mild effects.
