This paper describes corpus analysis and a psycholinguistic experiment regarding the acceptability of using non-restrictive NP modifiers to express semantic relations that might normally be signalled by 'because' and 'then'. The experiment tests several relevant factors and enables us to accept or reject a number of hypotheses. The results are incorporated into an NLG system based on a Genetic Algorithm. 1 Introduction To produce natural language text, an NLG system must be able to choose among possible paraphrases one that satisfies the highest number of constraints in a certain context. Paraphrases can use various constructions, for example, using nominalisation in-stead of a clause for event representation. We are particularly interested in the use of non-restrictive (NR) modifiers within a referring expression to express certain semantic relationQ other than object-attribute elaboration (in the sense defined in (Mann and Thompson, 1987)), for instance, causal relations, which are normally expressed by separate clauses connected by cue phrases (Knott, 1996) such as 'because '.","\"A non-restrictive component gives additional information to a head that has already been viewed as unique or as a member of a class that has been independently identified,-mud therefoee is not' essml; tial for the identification of the head\" (Quirk et al., 1985). This definition can be extended to account for modifiers of not only definite referring expressions, but also definite and indefinite NPs of various types. In this paper, an NR modifier refers to any NP modifying component that is not essential for identifying the object denoted by the head, including all modifiers of an NP that does not in-tend to identify (e.g. indefinite referring expressions and predicative phrases) (Kronfeld, 1990). Our discussion focuses on definite referring expressions including proper-names because of the dominance of such examples in our corpus. However, we would expect no difficulty in applying our observation to other types of NPs.","The semantic roles of NR modifiers, in particular NR clauses, are mentioned in many grammar and linguistics books. Quirk et al. (1985) point out that an NR clause in a referring expression is usually neutral in its semantic role (i.e. it provides descriptive information about its head), but sometimes it can contribute to the semantics of the main clause in a variety of ways. They summarise three types of semantic relations that can be expressed by an NR clause (examples are given in Figure 1):","® Causal, where the situation in the main clause is caused by that in the NR clause, e.g. (la).","® Temporal, where the two clauses form a time sequence, e.g. (lb).","® Circumstantial, where the NR clause sets a temporal or spatial framework for interpreting the main clause, e.g. (lc).","Halliday (1985) mentions that a subordinate clause can elaborate a part of its primary clause through restating, clarifying, refining or adding a descriptive attribute or comment (see (2) of Figure 1). Halliday's notion of elaboration is much more general than that in other coherence theories like RST (Maim \"andThompson; t987), and :the rdation expressed in (2) would not be treated as elaboration in most NLG systems.","Similar phenomena were observed from the MUSE corpus 2, a corpus of museum exhibit labels, which","l kVe are concerned with semantic (informational) relations in this paper• Argumentative {intentional) relations are be-yond the scope of this paper.","2This corpus is collected and annotated for the GNOME project (Poesio, 2000), which aims at developing general algorithms for generating nominal expressions. 108"]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["a. b.

For example, in (3) of Figure 1, the modifier French is not for identifying the name, but for establishing a concession relation between the main proposition and the subordinate phrase to increase the reader's positive regard for where Martin Carlin was born.","For the convenience of discussion, we define some terminology to be used throughout the paper:","An NR construction/sentence : a sentence that has a main clause and a subordinate NR modifier attached to one of its NPs (e.g. (4b) of Figure 2).","A hypotactic construction/sentence : a sentence that has a main clause and a dependent clause, connected by a cue phrase. This is a common way of expressing semantic relations such as causality (e.g. (4a) of Figure 2). In this syntactic category, we single out a subclass of sentences according to one possible semantic connection between the two clauses. It is defined below.","An elaboration realisation : a type of hypotactic construction where one clause elaborates the semantics of the other. We take cue phrases \"as for\" or \"what is more\" to signal elaboration relations 3 .","Previous research in NLG mainly focuses on using NR constructions to realise elaboration relations but not other semantic relations (e.g. (Scott and de Souza, 1990) and (Hovy, 1993)). The NR moditier usually adds a descriptive attribute to the object denoted by the head.","The linguistic research suggests for an NLG system the possibility to express certain semantic rela-cue phrases in most cases, and therefore could avoid using cues too heavily., This could be a better realisation under certain circumstances. Secondly, an NR construction enables a wider range of relations (especially those that are preferred to be expressed implicitly) to be selected for text structuring because the corresponding syntactic option is available.","To understand how to enable an NLG system to generate such modifiers, we are faced with two questions, which are not answered by linguistic research:","1. Can this type of modifier be identified by human subjects, i.e. can humans tell the difference between different NP modifier uses?","2. Under what circumstances can an NR construction be used in substitution of a hypotactic construction without changing the meaning dramatically and how close are the meanings conveyed by the two representations?","An NLG system must come up with some solutions, simple or complex, to these two questions in order to choose among paraphrases. In this paper, we use cue phrases ms a signal of semantic relations rather than try to identify the relations directly. We describe systematically controlled experiments aimed at finding out the factors related to the generation of this type of modifier in referring expressions. The result is intended to be reliable enough to be used by NLG systems in generating descriptive text.","2 Corpus annotation","To answer the first question, we annotated the","MUSE corpus, from which we have observed three","types of modifier uses in an NP: tions through NR constructions, which is important ....

Besides, our experiment does not heavily depend on these cue phrases. out these modifiers, the NP can denote more than one object/concept or sets of objects/concepts and is ambiguous in its interpretation, e.g. those in (6a). Such modifiers usually appear in phrases headed by the definite article 'the', which according to Loebner (1987) has the same meaning in all its uses, including in generic references and predicatives.

The effect of such modifiers is usually local to the heads they describe rather than to the main propositions as a whole, which is the main difference between this and the second type of modifier.","This type subsumes the modifiers normally generated by an aggregation module, in particular one using embedding (e.g. (Shaw and McKeown, 1997), (Cheng, 1998)).

Apart from other features, each modifier should be anno/atecl with a pragmatic function feature (PRAGM), which specifies why a modifier is used it: an NP. The possible values for this feature are unique, int and attr, corresponding to the three types of modifier uses described above (we will use the value names to refer to the different types of modifier in the rest of this paper). X.XlL was used as the markup language.","We' had -two trained annotators mark the NP modifiers in the MUSE corpus according to their understanding of the scheme. The agreement between them on the PRAGM feature by means of the Kappa statistic (Caxletta, 1996) is .734, which means that the distinctions we are trying to make can be identified by human subjects to some extent. The main ambiguity exists between int and attr modifiers. There seems to be a gradual difference between them and where to draw the line is a bit arbitrary.","In the MUSE corpus annotated so far, 19% of 1078 modifiers in all types of NPs axe identified as int. So this is not a trivial phenomenon. 3 An experiment We reduced the size of the problem of when to use an NR construction by focusing on two relations: a causal relation signalled by 'because' and a temporal relation signalled by 'then'. The reason for choosing these relations is that the possibilities of expressing them through NR constructions have already been shown by linguists. The two cue phrases are typical for the corresponding relations and can often substitute other cue phrases for the same relations. In the rest of this paper, we will still use the term causal or temporal relation, but what we actually mean is the specific relation signalled by 'because' or 'then'. 3.1 Independent variables and hypotheses From the generation point of view, our question is: given two facts and the semantic relation between them, what extra input do we need for making realisation decisions?","We collected examples of 'because' sentences from the MUSE corpus, and Wall .Street Journal source data, and transfered them to NR sentences by hand. Comparing the two constructions, we found some","~, .An~eresting..vaxiation.:. _Eor .example,:compaxing the sentences in Figure 2, we found intuitively that the meanings of (4a) and (4b) are much closer than those of (5a) and (5b).

A simiiar pa~ttern can be foun(i in a number of other collected sentences.","We claim that it is the degree ofinferrability of the relation between the semantics expressed through the two clauses that makes the difference. We define the inferrability of a causal/temporal relation as:","Given two separate ]acts, the likelihood of human subjects inferring from their world knowledge that a causal/temporal connection between the ]acts might plausibly exist.","In examples (4) and (5), the fact that Private Eye cannot afford the libel payment is very likely to directly cause the closure threaten, whereas a product occupying less space is not usually a cause of it being accepted by retailers according to common sense. Therefore, the two realisations in (4) can be used in substitution of one another whereas those in (5) cannot.","In]errability is dynamic and user dependent. Given two facts, people with different background knowledge can infer the relation between them with different ease. If a relation is easily recognisable according to general world knowledge, we say that the inferrability of the relation is globally strong, in which case a hypotactic and an NR construction can express the relation almost equally well (if not considering rhetorical effect). Context can also contribute to the inferrability of a relation. A relation not easily recognisable from world knowledge may be identified by a reader with ease as the discourse proceeds. In this case, we say that the inferrability of the relation is locally strong, where the two constructions can express the relation equally well only in a certain context. In this paper, we mainly consider the global aspect of a relation and we will describe how we decided the value of inferrability in the next section.","In Table 1, we summarise the factors (independent variables) that might play a role in the closeness judgement between the semantics of a hypotactie construction and an NR construction. The levels are possible values of these factors. Besides Relation and In]errability. Position gives the location of the NP that contains the NR modifier. It can be the first (initial) or the last (final) phrase in a sentenceS; Order gives the order of presentation; a hypotactic sentence to be compared with an NR sentence or vice versa, which is used to balance the influence of cue phrases on human judgement; Subordination specifies whether the nucleus or the satellite is realised as an NR clause6; and Cued/NoCue means using a cue phrase in the NR clause or not, which is only applicable to the temporal relation, for example,","(7) The health-care services announced the spinoff plan last January, which was then revised in May.","Based on our observation of human written sentences, we have the following hypotheses: Hypothesis ! For both causal and temporal relations, the inferrability of the relation between the semantics of two ]acts contributes significantly to the semantic similarities between a hypotactic construction and an NR construction.","In other words, if the in]errability of the relation between the two facts is strong, the semantic relation can be expressed similarly through an NR construction, otherwise, the similarity is significantly reduced. Hypothesis 2 For the causal relation, the satellite subordination bears significantly higher similarity m meaning to the hypotactic construction than the nucleus subordination does.","For example, (4b) would be preferred to \"Private Eye, which had been threatened with closure, couldn't afford the libel payment.\" Hypothesis 3 For the temporal relation, both the position of subordination and the use of an appropriate cue phrase in the NR clause make a significant difference to the semantic similarities between • a hypotactic and an NR construction. -","This hypothesis prefers Example (7) to the realisation that does not have 'then'.","5|n our implementation, we restrict ourselves to sentences with two NPs.","aWe assume that in the causal relation, the clause bearing 'because'is always the satellite. Since the temporal relation is a multinuclear relation, this factor does not apply. 111","Dependent Variables","Naturalness Similarity.","exactly the same _~ very similar","more similar than di~erent","N/A","natural","fairly natural","more different than similar so-so","very different fairly unnatural","totally different unnatural Table 2: Dependent variables and their values 3.2 The design of the experiment To assess a semantic similarity, which is thought to be influenced by the independent variables, we use human subjects to judge the following two dependent variables: Naturalness : how fluent a sentence is on its own.","Similarity : how similar the meanings of two sentences are without considering their naturalness.","The scales of the variables are selected such that all values on the scale have natural verbal descriptions that could be grasped easily by our subjects (see Table 2). Similar rating methods have been described in (Jordan et al., 1993) to compare the output of a machine translation system with that of expert humans.","Since we want to measure different groups of similarity judgement based on different in]errability, order or position levels, a between-groups design (Hatch and Lazaraton, 1991) seems to be most appropriate. The design we used is illustrated in Table 3, where all possible combinations of the independent variables are listed. In the table, paraphrases gives the types of alternative sentences each original sentence has. They should be scored by human subjects for their similarities to the original sentences and their naturalness.","We used a method similar to random selection to create a stratified random sample. The sample should contain 12 hypotactic sentences and 12 NR sentences: two for each combination of the causal relation and one for each combination of the temporal relation. These numbers were used to obtain as big a sample as possible which could still be judged by human subjects in a relatively short period of time (say less than 30 minutes).","Using cue phrases as- the indicators of'the se ..... mantic relations between clauses, we collected all the sentences containing 'because' or 'then' from the Wall Street Journal source data. and went through each of them to pick out those that actually signal the desired relations and can potentially have NR-realisations, i.e. where there is a coreference relation between the two NPs in the two clauses.

If it realised an unused factor combination, it was kept in the sample. This process was repeated until we collected the right number of test items which instantiated all combinations of properties in Table 3.","We asked two subjects to mark the 24 selected items with regard to their inferrability on a five-point scale: 5 for very likely, 4 for quite likely, 3 for possibly, 2 for .even less possibly and 1 for unknown.-We~took values of 4 and 5 as Strong ahd\"the others as weak. The subjects and an author agreed on 19 items, and the author's version was used for the experiment.","For the test items, we manually produced the corresponding paraphrases, which were then put into a questionnaire for human assessment of the two dependent variables for each paraphrase. 3.3 Results We had ten native English speakers evaluating tile similarity and naturalness on the sample. 3.3.1 Similarity Since the similarity data is ordinal data and departs significantly from a theoretical normal distribution according to One-Sample Komogorov-Smirnov Test, we chose Mann Whitney U, which is a test for comparing two groups on the basis of their ranks above and below the median. The result is summarised in Table 4, with statistically significant items in boldface (taking the conventional .05 p level). The Z scores tell how many standard deviations above or below the mean an observation might be. Means gives the means of the similarity scores with respect to the values of the independent variables in Table 1.","For the causal relation, there is a significant difference between the means of similarities of the two groups of different inferrabilities (P<.0005). So we have high confidence to accept part of Hypothesis 1. i.e. the strong inferrability of the causal relation between the semantics of two facts makes the semantic similarities between a hypotactic construction and an NR construction significantly higher than the weak case does. In the strong case, tile mean of similarity is 4.59, wilich is ,close to very similar.","We treated order as a factor to be balanced and did not expect it to have a significant effect, but it does (P=.008). An NR paraphrase shows much higher similarity to its corresponding hypotactic sen- .... tence (with a mean of 4.46) than the other way round (with a mean of 3.83), but the difference be-comes smaller for the strong inferrability case. This could be because the causal relations expressed in NR sentences generally sound weaker than those in hypotactic sentences and the cue phrase has a big influence on the perceptibility of a relation. 112","Independent Variables I Relation [ Order I inferrabflity I.Position causal temporal","strong initial","hypotactic vs. final","NR sentence weak initial","final","strong initial","NR sentence final","vs. hypotactic weak initial","final","strong initial","~ypot, actic vs ....... 5finAl","NR sentence weak initial","final","strong initial","NR sentence final","vs. hypotactic weak initial","final Paraphrases","nuc & sat subordination","NR sentence","nuc & sat subordination","NR sentence","causal & elaboration hypotactic • cued & not cued NR sentence","temporal & elaboration hypotactic Table 3: A between-groups Relation DependVar [ Factors causal (160 cases) temporal (80 cases) Similarity Similarity (cued) design","Means Z 2-tailed P Inferrability 4.59/3.70 -4.1015 <.0005 Order 4.46/3.83 -2.6400 .0083 Position 4.11/4.18 -.2136 .8308 Inferrability 4.88/5.00 -.1022 .9086 Order 5.08/4.80 -1.1756 .2398 Position 4.80/5.08 -2.0649 I .0389 Table 4: The output of Mann For the temporal relation,"]},{"title":"position","paragraphs":["is the only significant factor (P=.0389).
