We propose a novel approach to this issue, one based on statistical modeling and learning. We represent topics by means of word clusters, and employ a finite mixture model to represent a word distribution within a text. Our experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms a method that combines existing techniques. 1 Introduction -:We consider here the issue of 'topic analysis,' by which is determined a text's topic structure, which indicates what topics are included in a text and how topics change within the text. Topic analysis consists of two main tasks: topic identification and text segmentation (based on topic changes).","Topic analysis is extremely useful in a variety of text processing applications. For examplea it can be used in the automatic indexing of texts for purposes of information retrieval. With it, one can understand what the main topics and subtopics of a text are, and where those subtopics lie within the text.","To the best of our knowledge, however, no previous study has so far dealt with the topic analysis problem in the above sense. The most closely related are key word extraction and text segmentation. A keyword extraction method (e.g., that using tf-idf (Salton and Yang, 1973)) generally extracts from a text key words which represent topics within the text, but it does not conduct segmentation. A segmentation method (e.g., TextTiling (Hearst, 1997)) generally segments a text into blocks (paragraphs) in accord with topic changes within the text, but it does not identify (or label) by itself the topics discussed in each of the blocks.","The purpose of tMs paper is to provide a single framework for conducting topic analysis, i.e., performing both topic identification and text segmentation.","The key characteristics of our framework are 1) representing a topic by means of a cluster of words that are closely related to the topic, and 2) employing a stochastic model, called a .finite mixture model (e.g., (Everitt and Hand, 1981)), to represent a word distribution within a text. The finite mixture model has a hierarchical structure of probability distributions. The first level is a probability distribution of topics (topic distribution). The second level consists of probability distributions of words included within topics (word distributions). These word distributions are linearly combined to represent a word distribution within a text, with the topic distribution being used as the coefficient vector. Here-after we refer to a finite mixture model having this structure as a stochastic topic model (STM).","Before conducting topic analysis, we create word clusters (topics) on the basis of word co-occurrence in corpus data. We have developed a new method for word clustering using stochastic complexity (or the MDL principle) (Rissanen, 1996).","In topic analysis, we estimate a sequence of STMs that would have given rise to a given text, assuming that each block of a text is generated by an individual STM. We perform text segmentation by detecting significant differences between STMs and perform topic identification by means of estimation of STMs. With the results, we obtain the text's topic structure which consists of segmented blocks and their topics.","It is possible to perform topic analysis by combining an existing word extraction method (e.g., tf-idf) and an existing text seg-35 mentation method (e.g., TextTiling). Specifically, one can extract key words from a text using tf-idf, view these extracted key words as topics, segment the text into blocks using TextTiling, and estimate the distribution of topics (key words) within each block. Experimental results indicate, :however, that our method significantly outper~brms such a combined method in topic identification and outperforms it in text segmentation, because it utilizes word cluster information and employs a well-defined probability framework.","Finite mixture models have been employed in a number of text processing applications, such as text classification (e.g., (Li and Yamauishi, 1997; Nigam et al., 2000)) and information retrieval (e.g., (Hofmann, 1999)). As will be discussed, however, our definition of a finite mixture model and the way we use it here .differs significantly. 2 Stochastic Topic Model 2.1 Topic While the term 'topic' is used in different ways in different linguistic theories, we simply view it here as a subject within a text. We represent a topic by means of a cluster of words that are closely related to the topic, assuming that a cluster has a seed word (or several seed words) which indicates a topic. Figure 1 shows an example topic with the word 'trade' being the seed word."]},{"title":"I trade: trade export import tariff trader GATT protectionist","paragraphs":["I I Figure 1: Example topic 2.2 Definition of STM Let W denote a set of words, and K a set of topics. We first define a distribution of topics (clusters) P(k) : ~kEIK P(k) = 1. Then, for each topic k E K, we define a probability distribution of words P(wik) : ~,ew P(wlk) = 1. Here the value of P(wik) will be zeroif w is not included in k. We next define a Stochastic Topic Model (STM) as a finite mixture model, which is a linear combination of the word probability distributions P(w[k), with the topic distribution P(k) being used as the coefficient vector. The probability of word w in W is, then,","P(w) = ~ P(k)P(wlk ) we W. kEK Figure 2 depicts an example STM."]},{"title":"Figure 2: Example STM","paragraphs":["For the purposes of statistical modeling, it is advantageous to conceive of a text (i.e., a word sequence) as having been generated by some 'true' STMs, which we then seek to estimate as closely as possible. A text may have a number of blocks, and each block is assumed to be generated by an individual STM. The STMs within a text are assumed to have the same set of topics, but have different parameter values.","From the linguistic viewpoint, a text generally focuses on a single main topic, but it may discuss different subtopics in different blocks. While a text is discussing any one topic, it will more frequently use words strongly related to that topic. Hence, STM is a natural represen-tation of statistical word occurrence based on topics. 3 Word Clustering Before conducting topic analysis, we create word clusters using a large data corpus. More precisely, we treat all words in a vocabulary as seed words, and for each seed word we collect from the data those words which frequently co-occur with it and group them into a cluster. As one example, the word-cluster in Figure 1 has been constructed with the word 'trade' as the seed word.","We have developed a new method for reliably collecting frequently co-occurring words on the basis of stochastic complexity, or the MDL principle. For a given data sequence z m = xl...zm and for a fixed probability model M, 1 the stochastic complexity of x m relative to M, which we denote as SC(x m : M), is defined as the least code length required to encode x rn with M (Rissanen, 1996). SC(x m : M) can be interpreted as the amount information included in x n relative to M. The","1 Here, we use 'model' to refer to aprobability distnbution which has specified paxameters but unspecified parameter values. 36 MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle is a model selection criterion which asserts that, for a given data sequence, the lower a model's SC value, the greater its likelihood of being a model which would have actually generated the data. MDL has many good properties as a criterion for model selection. 2","For a fixed seed word s, we take a word w as a frequently co-occurring word if the presence of s is a statistically significant indicator of the presence of w.

Figure 3 shows an example topic structure as output with our method. The text has been segmented into five blocks, and to each block, a number of topics having high probability values have been assigned (topics axe represented by their seed words). The topic structure clearly represents what topics are included in the text and how the topics change within the text. 4.2 Outline Our topic analysis consists of three processes: a pre-process called 'topic spotting,' text segmentation, and topic identification. In topic","SNote that the quantity within [---] in (1) is (empirical) mutual inyormation, which is an effective measure for word co-occurrence calculation (cf.,(Brown et al., 1992)). When the sample size is small, mutual information values tend to be undesirably large. The quantity within {-..} in (1) can help avoid this undesirable tendency because its value will become large when data size is small. 37 ASIAI SXPOITERS PSAk DAEAOS Fit05 U.S.-IAPA| RIFT (25-HAE-1987) block 0 ........ trade-expor~-cari~t-impo:rt(O,12) Japan-Japa.l~ese(O.07) U$(0.06) 0 Sountin S trade friction between the U.:3. and $opau has raised fears amen S many of lsia*s exporting nations chat the row could inflict ... 1 They told Router correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. move against Japan might boost prote©tionist sentiment in she U.S. ~nd lead to ... 2 But some exporters said Chat while the conflict would hurt them in the lens-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. 3 The U.S. Xas said it sill ~apose 300 ~tn dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics seeds on April 17. in retaliation for Japa~*s ... 4 Unofficial Japanese ost~Jnates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlro and spokesmen for major electronics 1irma said they would ... 5 \"go wouldn't be able to do business,\" Isaid a spokesman for l.odin S ;apanese electronics ~irm Satanohita Electric Industrial ¢o Lad tlt. 6 \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a ~eg months it sill ~an the complete erosion of experts (o~ good8 subject ... block I ........ trade-export-ta~vif~-Impo:rt(O.lT) US(O.Og) Taiwan(O.05) dlrs(O.O$) T In Taigan. businessmen and officials ~re also worried. $ \"We ire agLre of the seriousness ot the U.5. threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to o|,\" said • senior Taiganese trade ... g Taiu&n had z trade trade surplus of 15~6 billion dire last year° gS pot of it uitb the U.$. 10 The surplus helped sgell 7aiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs. ninon S the world's largest. 11 \"Re must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut Import tariffs to allow imports o~ U.S. predicts, if ue want to de~nse ... 12 I senior officiL1 ef South [orea's tr~Lde promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. and Japan might also lead to ... 13 List year South |urea had a trade surplus ef 7.1 billion dlro uith the U.S.. np ~ron t.9 billion dlrs in 1985. 1~ In Halaysia. erode officers and businessmen said ~ou~h curbs against Japan might allen hard-hit producers o~ anuLicondnctors in third ... block 2 ........

We can indicate which topic is from which text or even which block of a text. Furthermore, we can indicate which topics are main topics of texts and which topics are subtopics (e.g., by displaying main topics in boldface, etc). In this way, users can get a fair sense of the contents of the texts simply by looking through the index. For a specific text, users can get a rough sense of the content by looking at the topic structure as, for example, it is shown in Figure 3.","Our method can also be useful for text min-ing, text summarization, information extraction, and other text processing, which require one to first analyze the structure of a text. 6 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has so far dealt with topic identification and text segmentation within a single framework.","A widely used method for key word extraction calculates the tf-idf value of each word in a text and uses those words having the largest tf-idf values as key words for that text (e.g., (Salton and Yang, 1973)). One can view these extracted key words as the topics of the text. No keyword extraction method by itself, how-ever, is able to conduct segmentation.","With respect to text segmentation, existing methods can be classified into two groups. One is to divide a text into blocks (e.g., TextTiling (Hearst, 1997)), the other to divide a stream of texts into its original texts (e.g.,(Allan et al., 1998; Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999; tteynar, 1999)). The former group generally employs unsupervised learning, while the latter supervised one. No existing segmentation method, however, has attempted topic identification.","TextTiling creates for each segmentation candidate two pseudo-texts, one preceding it and the other following it, and calculates as similarity the cosine value between the word frequency vectors of the two pseudo texts. It then conducts segmentation at valley points in a similar way to that of our method. Since the problem setting of TextTiling (in general the former group) is most close to that of our study, we use TextTiling for comparison in our experiments.","Our method by its nature performs topic identification and segmentation within a single framework. While it is possible with a combination of existing methods to extract key words from a given text by using tf-idf, view the extracted key words as topics, segment the text into blocks by employing TextTiling, estimate distribution of topics in each block, and identify topics having high probabilities in each block. Our method outper: forms such a combination (referred to here-after as 'Corn') for topic identification, because it utilizes word duster information. It also performs better than Com in text segmentation because it is based on a well-defined probability framework. Most importantly is that our method is able to output an easily understandable topic structure, which has not been proposed so far.","Note that topic analysis is different from text classification (e.g., (Lewis et al., 1996; Li and Yamanishi, 1999; Joachims, 1998; Weiss et al., 1999; Nigam et al., 2000)).

Note that the category labels of the training texts need not be used in clustering.","We next conducted a topic analysis on all the 3299 texts. The thresholds of l, h, and 0 were set at 20, 3, and 0.05, respectively, on the basis of preliminary experimental results. 7.3 Topic Structure We looked at the topic structures of the 3299 texts obtained by our method to determine how well they conformed to human intuition.","For topic identification in this experiment, clusters in each block were sorted in descending order of their probabilities, and the top 7 seed words were extracted to represent the topics of the block.","Figure 3 show results for the text with ID 14826; they generally agree well with human intuition. The text has been segmented into 5 blocks and the topics of each block is represented by 7 seed words. The main topic is represented by the seed-words 'trade-exporttariff-import.' The subtopics are represented by 'Japan-Japanese,' 'Taiwan,' 'Hong Kong,' etc. There were, however, a small number of errors. For example, the text should also have been segmented after sentences 11 and 13, but, due to limited sentence content, it was not. Furthermore, assigning subtopic of 'Button' (from 'Mr. Button') into block 3 (due to the high Shannon information value of the word 'Button') was also undesirable.

This is in contrast to the situation in most text classification experiments, in which labels are generally used both for training and for evaluation. It is not particularly meaningful, then, to compare the results for main topic identification obtained here with those for text classification.","With STM, clusters in each block were sorted in descending order of their probabilities, and the top k seed words were extracted to represent the topics of the block. Further-more, a seed word appearing in all the blocks of the text was considered to represent a main topic. When a text had not been segmented (i.e., has only one block), all top k seed words were considered to represent main topics.","Table 1 lists the largest 10 categories in the Reuters data. On the basis of the definition of each of the 10 categories, we assigned based on our intuition to each of them the identification words that are listed in Table 1.","For the evaluation, when the seed words for main topics contained at least one of the identification words, we considered our method to have identified the corresponding main topic equivalent to a human-determined category.","We then evaluated these in terms of precision and recall. Here, precision is defined as the ratio of the number of decisions correctly made to the total number of decisions made. Recall is defined as the ratio of the mrmber of decisions correctly made to the total number Table 2: Main topic identification results with respect to 7 top words category earn acq money-fx grain crude trade interest ship wheat corn","STM rec. pre.","Com rec. pre. 0.790 0.971 0.245 0.854 0.436 0.456 0.322 0.750 0.487 0.676 0.667 0.473 0.107 0.700 0.247 0.957 0.620 0.936 0.429 0.960 0.526 0.976 0.184 0.841 0.285 0.421 0.174 0.650 0.407 0.664 0.590 0.356 0.084 0.733 0.270 0.828 0.408 0.967 0.446 1.00","micro-average 0.515 0.824 0.365 0.774 Table 3: Main topic identification results with respect to 5 top words category earn acq money-fx grain crude trade interest ship wheat corn micro-average","STM rec. pre. 0.742 0.971 0.184 0.868 0.413 0.503 0.295 0.759 0.471 0.718 0.479 0.505 0.053 0.700 0.169 1.000 0.577 0.953 0.357 0.952 0.461 0.850","Corn rec. pre. 0.348 0.977 0.120 0.869 0.268 0.471 0.121 0.600 0.333 0.656 0.513 0.403 0.069 0.818 0.180 0.762 0.282 0.952 0.321 1.000 0.257 0.767 of decisions which should have been correctly made.","We also looked at the performance of Corn (cf., Section 6).

The comparison may be considered fair in that it requires each of the two methods to provide the same number of words to represent topics. Results indicate that STM significantly outperforms Corn, particularly in terms of recall.","The main reason for the higher performance achieved by STM is that it utilizes word cluster information. Figure 8 shows topic analysis results for the text with ID 15572 labeled with 'wheat.' The text contains only 15 content words (word types), thus all of the 15 words were extracted as key words and the text was not segmented by either method. Corn was unable to identify the main topic 'wheat,' because the probability of each of the relevant key words 'wheat' and 'flour' was low. In contrast, STM successfully identified the topic because the relevant key words were classified into the same cluster, and its probability was relatively high. 7.5 Segmentation and Subtopic","Identification We collected the 50 longest test texts (referred to here as 'seed texts') from each of the 10 categories, and combined each with a test text randomly selected from other categories to produce 500 pseudo-texts. Placement of the seed text within its pseudo-text (i.e., before or after the other text) was determined randomly.","We used both STM and Corn to segment each of the pseudo-texts into two blocks and identify subtopics.

With topic analysis, one can obtain a topic structure for a text.","Our method addresses topic analysis within a single framework. It has the following novel features: 1) it represents topics by means of word dusters and employs a finite mixture model (STM) to represent a word distribution within a text; 2) it constructs topics on the basis of corpus data before conducting topic analysis; 3) it segments a text by detecting significant differences between STMs; and 4) it identifies topics by estimating parameters 1°Here, k was set to 5 because the average length of a text was about 10 sentences. .... llWe will discuss the results in the full version of the paper. 43 Table 4: Text segmentation results category of seed text earn acq money-fx grain crude trade interest ship wheat corn Average STM 0.660 0.820 0.820 0.059 0.700 0.700 0.087 0.700 0.700 0.074 0.860 0.860 0.051 0.800 0.800 0.072 0.760 0.760 0.119 0.837 0.854 0.074 0.760 0.760 0.075 0.625 0.625 0.147","Corn","rec. pre. err. rec. pre. err.","0.660 0.167 0.640 0.640 0.171 0.740 0.740 0.085 0.660 0.660 0.121 0.660 0.660 0.076 0.820 0.820 0.066 0.800 0.800 0.081 0.820 0.820 0.084 0.816 0.833 0.084 0.640 0.640 0.130 0.650 0.650 0.105 0.725 0.726 0.100 0.752 0.754 0.092 of STMs.","Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms a method that combines existing techniques.
