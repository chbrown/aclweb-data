When such grammars are used in a restricted domain, it may be desirable to specialize them, in effect trading some coverage for a reduction in ambiguity. Grammar specialization is here given a novel formulation as an optimization problem, in which the search is guided by a global measure combining coverage, ambiguity and grammar size. The method, applicable to any unification grammar with a phrase-structure backbone, is shown to be effective in specializing a broad-coverage LFG for French. 1 Introduction Expressive grammar formalisms allow grammar developers to capture complex linguistic generalizations concisely and elegantly, thus greatly facilitating grammar development and maintenance. Broad-coverage grammars, however, tend to overgenerate considerably, thus allowing large amounts of spurious ambiguity. If the benefits resulting from more concise grammatical descriptions are to outweigh the costs of spurious ambiguity, the latter must be brought down. We here investigate a corpus-based compilation technique that reduces overgeneration and spurious ambiguity without jeopardizing coverage or burdening the grammar developer.","The current work extends previous work on corpus-based grammar specialization, which applies variants of explanation-based learning (EBL) to grammars of natural languages. The earliest work (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991) builds a specialized grammar by chunking together grammar rule combinations while parsing training examples. What rules to combine is specified by hand-coded criteria.","Subsequent work (Rayner and Carter, 1996; Samuelsson, 1994) views the problem as that of cutting up each tree in a treebank of correct parse trees into subtrees, after which the rule combinations corresponding to the subtrees determine the rules of the specialized grammar. This approach reports experimental results, using the SRI Core Language Engine, (Alshawi, 1992), in the ATIS domain, of more than a 3-fold speedup at a cost of 5% in grammatical coverage, the latter which is compensated by an increase in parsing accuracy. Later work (Samuelsson, 1994; Sima'an, 1999) at-tempts to automatically determine appropriate tree-cutting criteria, the former using local measures, the latter using global ones.","The current work reverts to the view of EBL as chunking grammar rules. It extends the latter work by formulating grammar specialization as a global optimization problem over the space of all possible specialized grammars with an objective function based on the coverage, ambiguity and size of the resulting grammar. The method was evaluated on the LFG grammar for French developed within the PAR-GRAM project (Butt et al., 1999), but it is applicable to any unification grammar with a phrase-structure backbone where the reference treebank contains all possible analyses for each training example, along with an indication of which one is the correct one.","To explore the space of possible grammars, a special treebank representation was developed, called a"]},{"title":"]folded treebank,","paragraphs":["which allows the objective function to be computed very efficiently for each candidate grammar. This representation relies on the fact that all possible parses returned by the original grammar for each training sentence axe available and the fact that the grammar specialization never introduces new parses; it only removes existing ones.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the initial candidate grammar and the operators used to generate new candidate grammars from any given one. The function to be maximized is introduced and motivated in Section 3. The folded treebank representation is described in Section 4, while Section 5 presents the experimental results. 2 Unfolding and Specialization The initial grammar is the grammar underly-ing the subset of correct parses in the training set. This is in itself a specialization of the grammar which was used to parse the treebank, since some rules may not show up in any correct parse in the training set; experimental results for this first-order specialization are reported in (Cancedda and Samuelsson, 2000). This grammar is further specialized by inhibiting rule combinations that show up in incorrect parses much more often than in correct parses.","In more detail, we considered downward unfolding of grammar rules (see Fig.l)3 A grammar rule is unfolded downwards on one of the symbols in its right-hand side if it is replaced by a set of rules, each corresponding to the expansion of the chosen symbol by means of an-other grammar rule. More formally, let G = (E, EN, S, R) be a context-free grammar, and let r,r' C R, k E .M + such that rhs(r) = aAfl, lal = k - 1, lhs(r') = A, rhs(r') = V. The rule adjunction of r I in the k th position of r is defined as a new rule RA(r, k, r ~) = r', such that: lhs(r\") = lhs(r) rhs(r\") = aVfl For unification grammars, we instead require lhs(r') U rhs(r)(k) lhs(r 1') = O(lhs(r)) rhs(r\") = O(oLTfl ) where rhs(r)(k) is the kth symbol of rhs(r), where X t3 Y indicates that X and Y unify, and where 0 is the most general unifier of lhs(r ~) and rhs(r)(k).","The downward rule unfolding of rule r on its k th position is then defined as: DRU(r, k) =","1The converse operation, upward unfolding, was not used in the current experiments.","{r'[3r\"[r' = RA(r, k, r\")]} if ¢ 0 = {r} otherwise","It is easy to see that if all r I E DRU(r, k) are retained then the new grammar has exactly the same coverage as the old one. Once the rule has been unfolded, however, the grammar can be specialized. This involves inhibiting some rule combinations by simply removing the corresponding newly created rules. Any subset X C_ DRU(r,k) is called a downward specialization of rule r on the k th element of its rhs.","Given a grammar, all possible (downward) unfoldings of its rules are considered and, for each unfolding, the specialization leading to the best increase in the objective function is determined. The set of all such best specializations defines the set of candidate successor grammars. In the experiments, a simple hill-climbing algorithm was adopted. Other iterative-refinement schemes, such as simulated annealing, could easily be implemented. 3 The Objective Function Previous research approached the task of determining which rule combinations to allow either by a process of manual trial and error or by statistical measures based on a collection of positive examples only: if the original grammar produces more than a single parse of a sentence, only the \"correct\" parse was stored in the treebank. However, we here also have access to all incorrect parses assigned by the original grammar. This in turn means that we do not need to estimate ambiguity through some correlated statistical indicator, since we can measure it directly simply by checking which parse trees are licensed by every new candidate grammar G. There are many possible ways of combining the counts of correct and incorrect parses in a suitable objective function. For the sake of sireplicity we opted for a linear combination. However, simply maximizing correct parses and minimizing incorrect ones would most likely lead to overfitting. In fact, a grammar with one large flat rule for each correct parse in the treebank would achieve a very high score during training, but most likely perform poorly on unseen data. A way to avoid overfitting consists in penalizing large grammars by introducing an appropriate term in the linear combination.

Acorr and Ainc are weights controlling the pruning aggressiveness: their ratio Acorr/Ainc intuitively corresponds to the number of incorrect trees a specialization must disallow for each disallowed correct tree, if the specialization is to lead to an improvement over the current grammar. The lower this ratio is, the more aggressive the pruning is. The relative value of ;~size with respect to the other As also controls the depth to which the search is conducted: most specializations result in an increase in grammar size, which tends to be more and more significant as the number and the size of rules grows; a larger Asize thus has the effect of stopping the search earlier. Note that only two of the three weights are independent. 4 Treebank Representation A folded treebank is a representation of a set of parse trees which allows an immediate as-sessment of the effects of inhibiting specific rule combinations. It is based on the idea of \"folding\" each tree onto a representation of the grammar itself. Any phrase-structure grammar can be represented as a concatenation/or graph -- a directed bipartite multigraph with an or-node for each symbol and a concatenation-node for each rule in the grammar. The present description covers context-free grammars, but the scheme can easily be extended to any unification grammar with a context-free backbone by replacing symbol eqality with unification.","Given a grammar G = (E, EN,"]},{"title":"S,R),","paragraphs":["we can define a relation ~ and a (partial) function ~?n: • ~/~ C EN × R s.t.

Recall is the same as coverage: the ratio between the number of correct parses produced by the specialized grammar and the total number of correct parses (equalling the total number of sentences in the test set). Precision is the ratio between the number of correct parses produced by the specialized grammar and the total number of parses produced by the same grammar.

Corpus-independent compilation techniques, although useful for increasing efficiency, do little in terms of reducing ambiguity.","In this paper we proposed a corpus-based technique for specializing a grammar on a do-main for which a treebank exists containing all trees returned for each sentence. This technique, which builds extensively on previous work on explanation-based learning for NLP, consists in casting the problem as an optimization problem in the space of all possible specializations of the original grammar. As initial candidate grammar, the first-order pruning of the original grammar is considered. Candidate successor grammars are obtained through the downward rule unfolding and specialization operator, that has the desirable property of never causing previously unseen parses to become available for sentences in the training set. Candidate grammars are then assessed according to an objecting function combining grammar ambiguity and coverage, adapted to avoid overfitting. In order to ensure efficient computability of the objective function, the treebank is previously folded onto the grammar itself. Experimental results using a broad-coverage lexicalfunctional grammar of French show that the technique allows effectively trading coverage for ambiguity reduction. Moreover, the parameters of the objective function can be used to control the trade off. specialization experiments.
