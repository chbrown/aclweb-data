University of Alicante. 03690 San Vicente del Raspeig. Aiicante, Spain.","{jperal, antonio} @dlsi.ua.es Abstract In this ~paper, we present the Interlingua system ISS to generate the pronominal anaphora into the Spanish and English languages. We also describe the main problems in the pronoun generation into both languages such as zero-subject constructions and number, gender and syntactic differences. Our system improves other proposals presented so far due to the fact that we are able to solve and generate intersentential anaphora, to detect coreference chains and to generate Spanish zero-pronouns into English, issues that are hardly considered by other systems. Finally, we provide outstanding results of our system on unrestricted corpora. Introduction One of the main problems of many commercial Machine Translation (MT) and experimental systems is that they do not carry out a correct pronominal anaphora generation. Solving the anaphora and extracting the antecedent are key issues in a correct generation into the target language. Unfortunately, the majority of MT systems do not deal with anaphora resolution and their successful operation usually does not go beyond the sentence level. In this paper, we present a complete approach that allows pronoun resolution and generation into the target language.","Our approach works on unrestricted texts unlike other systems, like the KANT interlingua system (Leavitt et al. (1994)), that are designed for well-defined domains. Although full parsing of these texts could be applied, we have used partial parsing of the texts due to the unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar. This is a main difference with the majority of the interlingua systems such as the DLT system based on a modification of Esperanto (Witkam (1983)), the Rosetta system which is experimenting with Montague semantics as the basis for an interlingua (Appelo and Landsbergen (1986)), the KANT system, etc. as they use full parsing of the text.","After the parsing and solving pronominal anaphora, an interlingua representation of the whole text is obtained. In the interlingua representation no semantic information is used as input, unlike some approaches that have as input semantic information of the constituents (Miyoshi et al. (1997), Castell6n et al. (1998), the DLT system, etc).","From this interlingua representation, the generation of anaphora (including intersentential anaphora), the detection of coreference chains of the whole text and the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English have been carried out, issues that are hardly considered by other systems. Furthermore, this approach can be used for other different applications, e.g. Information Retrieval, Summarization, etc. The paper is organized as follows: In section 1, the complete approach that includes Analysis, Interlingua and Generation modules will be described. These modules will be explained in detail in the next three sections. In section 5, the Generation module has been evaluated in order ! This paper has been partly financed by the collaborative research project between Spain and The United Kingdom number HB 1998-0068. 42 to measure the efficiency of our proposal. To do so, two experiments have been accomplished: the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English (syntactic generation module) and the generation of English pronouns into Spanish ones (morphological generation module). Finally, the conclusions of this work will be presented."]},{"title":"1 System Architecture","paragraphs":["The complete approach that solves and generates the anaphor is based on the scheme of Figure 1.

System architecture.","As can be observed in Figure 1, there are three independent modules in the process of generation: Analysis, Interlingua and Generation modules."]},{"title":"2 Analysis module","paragraphs":["The analysis is carried out by means of SUPAR (Slot Unification Parser for Anaphora resolution) system, presented in Femindez et al. (2000). SUPAR is a computational system focused on anaphora resolution. It can deal with several kinds of anaphora, such as pronominal anaphora, one-anaphora, surface-count anaphora and definite descriptions. In this paper, we focus on pronominal anaphora resolution and generation into the target language. In pronominal anaphora resolution in both the Spanish and English languages, the system has achieved an accuracy of 84% and 87% respectively.","A grammar defined by means of the grammatical formalism SUG (Slot Unification Grammar) is used as input of SUPAR. A translator that transforms SUG rules into Prolog clauses has been developed. This translator will provide a Prolog program that will parse each sentence. SUPAR allows to carry out either a full or a partial parsing of the text, with the same parser and grammar. Here, partial parsing techniques have been used due to the unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar and the use of unrestricted texts (corpora) as inputs.","These unrestricted corpora used as input for the partial parser contain the words tagged with their grammatical categories obtained from the output of a part-of-speech (POS) tagger. The word, as it appears in the corpus, its lemma and its POS tag (with morphological information) is supplied for each word in the corpus. The corpus is split into sentences before applying the parsing.","The output of the parsing module will be the Slot Structure (SS) that stores the necessary information 2 for Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem resolution. This SS will be the input for the following module in which NLP problems (anaphora, extraposition, ellipsis, etc.) will be treated and solved.","In Fernindez et al. (1998), a partial parsing 3 strategy that provides all the necessary information for resolving anaphora is presented. This partial parsing shows that only the following constituents are necessary for anaphora resolution: co-ordinated prepositional and noun phrases, pronouns, conjunctions and 2 The SS stores for each constituent the following information: constituent name (NP, PP, etc.), semantic and morphologic information, discourse marker (identifier of the entity or discourse object) and the SS of its subconstituents. 3 It is important to emphasize that the system allows to carry out a full parsing of the text. In this paper, partial parsing with no semantic information is used in the evaluation of our approach. 43 verbs, regardless of the order in which they appear in the text. The free words consist of constituents that are not covered by this partial parsing (e.g. adverbs).","After applying the anaphora resolution module, a new Slot Structure (SS') is obtained. In this new structure the correct antecedent (chosen from the possible candidates) for each anaphoric expression will be stored together with its morphological and semantic information. SS' will be the input for the lnterlingua system. 3 Interlingua system (ISS) As said before, the Interlingua system takes the SS of the sentence after applying the anaphora resolution module as input. This system, named lnterlingua Slot Structure (1SS), generates an interlingua representation from the SS of the sentence.","SUPAR generates one SS for each sentence from the whole text and it solves intrasentential and intersententiai anaphora. Then, 1SS generates the interlingua representation of the whole text. This is one of the main advantages of 1SS because it is possible to generate intersentential pronominal anaphora.","To begin with, 1SS splits sentences into clauses 4. To identify a new clause when partial parsing has been carried out, the following heuristic has been applied: H1 Let us assume that the beginning of a new clause has been found when a verb is parsed and a free conjunction is subsequently parsed.","In this particular case, a free conjunction does not imply conjunctions that join co-ordinated noun and prepositional phrases. It refers, here, to conjunctions that are parsed in our partial parsing scheme.","Once the text has been split into clauses, the next stage is to generate the interlingua representation for clauses. We have used a complex feature structure for each clause. In Figure 2 the information of the first clause of the example (1) is presented: (1) The boys of the mountains were in the garden. They were catching flowers. 4 A clause could be defined as \"a group of words containing a verb\".

Semantic roles that have been used in this approach are the following: ACTION, AGENT, THEME and MODIFIER that correspond to verb, subject, object and prepositional phrases of the clause respectively. The notation we have used is based on the representation used in KANT interlingua. To identify these semantic roles when partial parsing has been carried out and no semantic knowledge is used, the following heuristic has been applied: H2 Let us assume that the NP parsed before the verb is the agent of the clause. In the same way, the NP parsed after the verb is the theme of the clause. Finally., all the PP found in the clause are its modifiers. 5 Only the relevant attributes of each semantic role appear in a simplified way in the picture.

These omitted pronouns are usually named zero-pronouns. While in other languages, zero-pronouns may appear in either the subject's or the object's grammatical position, (e.g. Japanese), in Spanish texts, zero-pronouns only appear in the position of the subject. In English texts, this sort of pronoun occurs far less frequently, as the use of them are generally compulsory in the language. Nevertheless, some examples can be found: \"Ross carefully folded his trousers and ~.climbed into bed\". (The symbol ~ shows the position of the omitted pronoun).. Target languages with typical elliptical (zero) constructions corresponding to source English pronouns are Italian, Thai, Chinese or Japanese.","In order to generate Spanish zero-pronouns into English, they must first be located in the text (ellipsis detection), and then resolved (anaphora resolution). At the ellipsis detection stage, information about the zero-pronoun (e.g. person, gender, and number) must first be obtained from the verb of the clause and then used to identify the antecedent of the zero-pronoun (resolution stage). The detection process depends on the knowledge about the structure of the language itself, which gives us clues to the use of each type of zero-pronoun.","The resolution of zero-pronouns has been implemented in SUPAR. As we may work on unrestricted texts to which partial parsing is applied, zero-pronouns must also be detected when we do not dispose of full syntactic information. Once the input text has been split into clauses after applying the heuristic H1, the next problem consists of the detection of the omission of the subject from each clause.","If partial parsing techniques have been applied, we can establish the following heuristic to detect the omission of the subject from each clause: H3 After the sentence has been divided into clauses, a noun phrase or a pronoun is sought, for each clause, through the clause constituents on the left-hand side of the verb, unless it is imperative or impersonal. Such a noun phrase or pronoun must agree in person and number with the verb of the clause. Sometimes, gender information of the","pronoun can be obtained when the verb is","copulative. For example, in: (3) Pedroj vio a Anak en el parque. Ok Estaba muy guapa.","(Peterj saw Annk in the park. Shek was very beautiful.)","In this example, the verb estaba (was) is copulative, so that its subject must agree in gender and number with its object whenever the object can have either a masculine or a feminine linguistic form (guapo: masc, guapa: fem). We can therefore get information about its gender from the object, guapa (\"beautiful\" in its feminine form) which automatically assigns it to the feminine gender so the omitted pronoun would have to be she rather than he.","After the zero-pronoun has been detected, SUPAR inserts the pronoun (with its information of person, gender and number) in the position in which it has been omitted. This pronoun will be detected and resolved in the following module of anaphora resolution. After that, ISS generates the interlingua representation of the text.","In the example (3), two CLAUSES are identified. In the second CLAUSE the zero-pronoun is detected (third person, singular and feminine -she-) and solved (third person, singular and feminine -Ann-). So the AGENT of this CLAUSE is the PRONOUN she and it has a link to the ENTITY Ann (the chosen antecedent).","Now, the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English is easy because all the information that it is needed is located in the interlingua representatio.n. The English pronoun's information is extracted in the following way: number and person information are obtained from the PRONOUN and gender information is obtained from the Head of its antecedent. 47"]},{"title":"4.2 Morphological","paragraphs":["generation In the morphological generation we mainly have to treat and solve number and gender discrepancies in the generation of pronouns. 4.2.1 Number discrepancies This problem is generated by the discrepancy between words of different languages that express the same concept. These words can be referred to a singular pronoun in the source language and to a plural pronoun in the target language. For example, in English the concept .people is plural, whereas in Spanish is singular. (4) Tile stadium was full of peoplej. They~ were very angry withthe referee. (5) El estadio estaba /leno de gentei. ~stai estaba muy enfadada con el ~rbitro.","In (4), it can be observed that the name people in English has been replaced with the plural pronoun they, whereas in Spanish (5) the name gente has been replaced with the singular pronoun dsta (it). Gender discrepancies also exist in the translation of other languages such as in the German-English translation.","In order to take into account number discrepancies in the generation of the pronoun into the target language a set of morphological (number) rules is constructed.","In the generation of the pronoun They into Spanish in the example (4), the interlingua representation has a PRONOUN ('they', third person and plural) that it is linked to the ENTITY ('police', plural). For the correct generation into Spanish the following morphological rule is constructed: pronoun + third..person + plural + antecedent (~olice') ~ ~sta (pronoun, third person, feminine and singular)","The left-hand side of the morphological rule contains the interlingua representation of the pronoun and the right-hand side contains the pronoun in the target language.","In the same way, a set of morphological rules is constructed in order to generate English pronouns. Next, an example of these rules is shown: pronoun + third_person + singular + antecedent ('policla~ ~ they (pronoun, third person and plural) 4.2.2 Gender discrepancies English has less morphological information than Spanish. With reference to plural personal pronouns, the pronoun we can be translated into nosotros (masculine) or nosotras (feminine), you into ustedes (masculine/feminine), vosotros (masculine) or vosotras (feminine) and they into ellos or elias. Furthermore, the singular personal pronoun it can be translated into dl/dste (masculine) or ella/dsta (feminine). For example: (6) Women~ were in the shop. They~ were buying gifts for their husbands. (7) Las mujeresl estaban en la tienda. Ellasi estaban comprando regains pard sus maridos.","In Spanish, the plural name mujeres (women) is feminine and is replaced by the personal pronoun elias (plural feminine) (7), whereas in English they is valid for masculine as well as for feminine (6). \",","These discrepancies do not always mean that Spanish anaphors bear more information than English one. For example, Spanish possessive adjectives ~ casa) do not carry gender information whereas English possessive adjectives do (his~her house).","We can find similar discrepancies among other languages. For example, in the French-German translation, gender is assigned arbitrarily in both languages (although in French is not as arbitrarily as in German). The English-German translation, like English-Spanish, supposes a translation from a language with neutral gender into a language that assigns gender grammatically.","As commented, it is important to emphasize that the omission of the pronominal subject is very usual in Spanish. If we want to stress the subject of a clause or distinguish between different possible subjects, we will have to write the pronominal subject. Otherwise, pronominal subject could be omitted. We are interested, however, in the correct generation of pronouns, and therefore, they will never be omitted.","Thanks to the fact that our system solves only personal pronouns in third person, we have only studied gender discrepancies in the generation of the third person pronouns.

If we have a pronoun with the following attributes: masculine, singular and third person in the interlingua representation, this can be generated into the Spanish pron6uns he or it.

To do so, one experiment for each module has been accomplished. In the first one, the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English, using the techniques described above in subsection 4.1.2, has been evaluated 6. In the second one, the generation of English pronouns into Spanish ones has been evaluated. In this experiment number and gender discrepancies and their resolution, described above in section 4.2, have been taken into account.","With reference to the first experiment, our computational system has been trained with a 6 Syntactic discrepancies has not been evaluated due to the aim of this work is only the pronominal anaphora generation into the target language, so the evaluation of the generation of the whole sentence into the target language has been omitted. 49 handmade corpus 7 that contains 106 zero-pronouns.

After that, we have carried out a blind evaluation on unrestricted texts using the set of preferences and the generation techniques learned during the training phase. In this case, partial parsing of the text with no semantic information has been used.","With regard to unrestricted texts, our system has been run on two different Spanish corpora: a) a fragment of the Spanish version of The Blue Book corpus (15,571 words), which contains the handbook of the International Telecommunications Union CCITT, and b) a fragment of the Lexesp corpus (9,746 words), which contains ten Spanish texts from different genres and authors. These texts are taken mainly from newspapers. These corpora have been POS-tagged. Having worked with different genres and disparate authors, we feel that the applicability of our proposal to other sorts of texts is assured.","To evaluate the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English three tasks have been accomplished: a) the evaluation of the detection of zero-pronouns, b) the evaluation of anaphora resolution and c) the evaluation of generation. a) Evaluating the detection of zero-pronouns.","To do this, verbs have been classified into","two categories: 1) verbs whose subjects","have been omitted, and 2) verbs whose","subjects have not.

This lower success rate is","This corpus contains sentences with zero-pronouns made by different researchers of our Research Group. g By \"success rate\", we mean the number of verbs successfully classified, divided by the total number of verbs in the text. justified for several reasons. One important reason is the non-detection of impersonal verbs by the POS tagger. Two other reasons are. the lack of semantic information and the inaccuracy of the grammar used. It is important to note that 46% of the verbs in these corpora have their subjects omitted. It shows quite clearly the importance of this phenomenon in Spanish.","b) Evaluating anaphora resolution. In this task, the evaluation of zero-pronoun resolution is accomplished. Of the 1,599 verbs classified in these two corpora, 734 of them have zero-pronouns. Only 228 of them 9, however, are in third person and will be anaphorically resolved. A success rate of 75% was attained for the 228 zero-pronouns. By \"successful resolutions\" we mean that the solutions offered by our system agree with the solutions offered by two human experts.","c) Evaluating zero-pronoun generation. The generation of the 228 Spanish zero-pronouns into English has been evaluated. The following results in the generation have been obtained: a success rate of 70% in Lexesp and a success rate of 899'o in The Blue Book. In general (both corpora) a success rate of 75% has been achieved. The errors are mainly produced by fails in anaphora resolution and fails in the generation of pronouns he/she/it (some heuristics 10, which have failed sometimes, have been applied due to the used corpora do not include semantic information).

With reference to the choice of the gender of the antecedent's Head, an electronic dictionary has been used in order to translate the original English word into the Spanish one, and subsequently, the gender is extracted from the Spanish word. Several problems have occurred when using this electronic dictionary: 1) ' the word to be translated does not appear in","the dic-tionary, and therefore, a heuristic is","applied to assign the gender 2) the correct sense of the English word is not","chosen, and therefore, the gender could be","assigned incorrectly. Conclusion In this paper a complete approach to solve and generate pronominal anaphora in the Spanish and English languages is presented. The approach works on unrestricted texts to which partial parsing techniques have been applied. After the parsing and solving pronominal anaphora, an interlingua representation (based on semantic roles and features) of the whole text is obtained. The representation of the whole text is one of the main advantages of our system due to several problems, that are hardly solved by the majority of MT systems, can be treated and solved. These problems are the generation of intersentential anaphora, the detection of coreference chains and the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English. Generation of zero-pronouns and Spanish personal pronouns has been evaluated obtaining a success rate of 75% and 85.41% respectively. References","Appelo, L. and Landsbergen, J.
