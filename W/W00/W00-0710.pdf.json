Monadic class symbols are replaced by bit strings, which are learned by an ensemble of binary-valued classifiers (dichotomizers). In this study, the idea of ECOC is applied to memory-based language learning with local (k-nearest neighbor) classifiers. Regression analysis of the experimental results reveals that, in order for ECOC to be successful for language learning, the use of the Modified Value Difference Metric (MVDM) is an important factor, which is explained in terms of population density of the class hyperspace. 1 Introduction Supervised learning methods applied to natural language classification tasks commonly operate on high-level symbolic representations, with linguistic classes that are usually monadic, without internal structure (Daelemans et al., 1996; Cardie et al., 1999; Roth, 1998). This contrasts with the distributed class encoding commonly found in neural networks (Schmid, 1994). Error-correcting output codes (ECOC) have been introduced to machine learning as a principled and successful approach to distributed class encoding (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995; Ricci and Aha, 1997; Berger, 1999). With ECOC, monadic classes are replaced by codewords, i.e. binary-valued vectors. An ensemble of separate classifiers (dichotomizers) must be trained to learn the binary subclassifications for every instance in the training set. During classification, the bit predictions of the various dichotomizers are combined to produce a codeword prediction. The class codeword which has minimal Hamming distance to the predicted codeword determines the classification of the instance. Codewords are constructed such that their Hamming distance is maximal. Extra bits are added to allow for error recovery, allowing the correct class to be determinable even if some bits are wrong. An error-correcting output code for a k-class problem constitutes a matrix with k rows and 2 k-1-1 columns. Rows are the codewords corresponding to classes, and columns are binary subclassifications or bit functions fi such that, for an instance e, and its codeword vector"]},{"title":"C","paragraphs":["fi(e) = ~-i(c) (1) (~-i(v) the i-th coordinate of vector v).

From an information-theoretic perspective, classification with ECOC is like channel coding (Shannon, 1948): the class of a pattern to be classified is a datum sent over a noisy communication channel. The communication channel consists of the trained classifier. The noise consists of the bias (systematic error) and variance (training set-dependent error) of the classifier, which together make up for the overall error 55 of the classifier. The received message must be decoded before it can be interpreted as a classification. Adding redundancy to a signal before transmission is a well-known technique in digital communication to allow for the recovery of errors due to noise in the channel, and this is the key to the success of ECOC. From a machine learning perspective, an error-correcting output code uniquely partitions the instances in the training set into two disjoint subclasses, 0 or 1. This can be interpreted as learning a set of class boundaries. To illustrate this, consider the following binary code for a three-class problem. (This actually is a one-of-c code with no error-correcting capability (the minimal Hamming distance between the codewords is 1). As such it is an error-correcting code with lowest error correction, but it serves to illustrate the point.)","fl f2 f3 C1 0 0 1 C2 01 0 (2) C3 1 0 0 For every combination of classes (C1-C2, C1-C3, C2-C3), the Hamming distance between the codewords is 2. These horizontal relations have vertical repercussions as well: for every such pair, two bit functions disagree in the classes they select. For C1-C2, f2 selects C2 and f3 selects C1. For C1-C3, fl selects C3 and f3 selects C1. Finally, for C2-C3, fl selects C3 and f2 selects C2. So, every class is selected two times, and this implies that every class boundary associated with that class in the feature hyperspace is learned twice. In general (Kong and Dietterich, 1995), if the minimal Hamming distance between the codewords of an (error-correcting) code is d, then every class boundary is learned d times. For the error-correcting code from above this implies an error correction of zero: only two votes support a class boundary, and no vote can be favored in case of a conflict. The decoding of the predicted bit string to a class symbol appears to be a form of voting over class boundaries (Kong and Dietterich, 1995), and is able to reduce both bias and variance of the classifier. 2 Dichotomizer Ensembles Dichotomizer ensembles must be diverse apart from accurate. Diversity is necessary in order to decorrelate the predictions of the various dichotomizers. This is a consequence of the voting mechanism underlying ECOC, where bit functions can only outvote other bit functions if they do not make similar predictions. Selecting different features per dichotomizer was proposed for this purpose (Ricci and Aha, 1997). Another possibility is to add limited non-locality to a local classifier, since classifiers that use global information such as class probabilities during classification, are much less vulnerable to correlated predictions. The following ideas were tested empirically on a suite of natural language learning tasks.","• A careful feature selection approach, where every dichotomizer is trained to select (possibly) different features.","• A careless feature selection approach, where every bit is predicted by a voting committee of dichotomizers, each of which randomly selects features (akin in spirit to the Multiple Feature Subsets approach for non-distributed classifiers (Bay, 1999).","• A careless feature selection approach, where blocks of two adjacent bits are predicted by a voting committee of"]},{"title":"quadrotomizers,","paragraphs":["each of which randomly selects features.

The following linguistic tasks were used. DIMIN is a Dutch diminutive formation task derived from the Celex lexical database for Dutch (Baayen et al., 1993). It predicts Dutch nominal diminutive suffixes from phonetic properties (phonemes and stress markers) of maximally the 57 last three syllables of the noun. The STRESS task, also derived from the Dutch Celex lexP cal database, assigns primary stress on the basis of phonemic values. MORPH assigns morphological boundaries (a.o. root morpheme, stress-changing affix, inflectional morpheme), based on English CELEX data. The WSJ-NPVP task deals with NP-VP chunking of PoStagged Wall Street Journal material. GRAPHON, finally, is a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion task for English based on the English Celex lexical database. Numeric characteristics of the different tasks are listed in table 1. All tasks with the exception of GRAPHON happened to be five-class problems; for GRAPHON, a five-class subset was taken from the original training set, in order to keep computational demands manageable.

For feature selection-based ECOC, backward sequential feature elimination was used (Raaijmakers, 1999), repeatedly eliminating features in turn and evaluating each elimination step with 10-fold cross-validation. For dichotomizer weighting, error information of the dichotomizers, determined from separate unweighted 10-fold cross-validation experiments on a separate training set, produced a weighted Hamming distance metric. Error-based weights were based on raising a small constant ~ in the interval [0, 1) to the power of the number of errors made by the dichotomizer (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 1996). Random feature selection drawing features with replacement created feature sets of both different size and composition for every dichotomizer. 5 Results Table 3 lists the generalization accuracies for the control groups, and table 4 for the ECOC algorithms.

The ECOC algorithm based on feature selection and weighted Hamming distance performs best. Voting-based ECOC performs poorly on DIMIN and STRESS with voting per bit, but significant accuracy gains are achieved by voting per block, putting it on a par with the best performing algorithm. Regression analysis was applied to investigate the effect of the Modified Value Difference Metric on ECOC accuracy. First, the accuracy gain of MVDM as a function of the information gain ratio of the features was computed. The results show a high correlation (0.82, significant at p < 0.05) between these variables, indicating a linear relation. This is in line with the idea underlying MVDM: whenever two feature values are very predictive of a shared class, they contribute to the similarity between the instances they belong to, which will lead to more accurate classifiers. Next, regression analysis was applied to determine the effect of MVDM on ECOC, by relating the accuracy gain of MVDM (k=3) compared to 58 TASK £1 (I) g2(I) $3 (III) $4 (III) $5 (IV) $6 (IV) $7 (IV) g8 ($6) DIMIN 98.6=k0.4x/ 98.5=k0.4x/ 98.6:k0.6~/ 98.7::k0.6x/ 98.8::k0.5x/ 98.9::k0.4~/ 96.6:k0.9x 98.4=E0.4 STRESS 85.3::kl.Sx/ 86.3::k2.0X/ 88.2=hl.7x/ 88.8=t:1.7X/ 88.2:kl.7x/ 89.3::kl.9~/ 86.5=k2.3x 88.8::kl.7 MORPH 93.2:kl.6x/ 93.2=kl.5x/ 93.2=kl.3x/ 93.2=kl.3~/ 93.2=1=1.6~/ 93.2=kl.5~/ 93.0::kl.6x/ 93.4:t=1.5x/ NPVP t 96.8::k0.1~/ 96.9::k0.2x/ 96.8=E0.1 96.9:k0.1 96.8::k0.1 96.9=k0.1 96.8=h0.2x 96.8=t:0.2 GRAPHON 98.2=t=0.7 98.3=t=0.7 98.4:k0.6X/ 98.3=E0.5X/ 98.3::h0.6X/ 98.5::k0-5X/ 97.6=k0.7x 97.6:h0.8x Table 4: Generalization accuracies for feature selection-based ECOC (x/ indicates significant improvement over control group (in round brackets) , and x deterioration at p < 0.05 using paired t-tests).

The correlation between these two variables is very high (0.93, significant at p < 0.05), again indicative of a linear relation. From the per-spective of learning class boundaries, the strong effect of MVDM on ECOC accuracy can be understood as follows. When the overlap metric is used, members of a training set belonging to the same class may be situated arbitrarily remote from each other in the feature hyperspace. For instance, consider the following two instances taken from DIMIN: ......... d,A,k,je ........."]},{"title":"d,A,x,je","paragraphs":["(Hyphens indicate absence of feature values.)

Yet, these two instances have coordinates on the twelfth dimension of the feature hyperspace that have nothing to do with each other. The overlap treats the k-x value clash just like any other value clash. This phenomenon may lead to a situation where in-habitants of the same class are scattered over the feature hyperspace. In contrast, a value difference metric like MVDM which attempts to group feature values on the basis of class cooccurrence information, might group k and x together if they share enough classes. The effect of MVDM on the density of the feature hyperspace can be compared with the density obtained with the overlap metric as follows. First, plot a random numerical transform of a feature space. For expository reasons, it is adequate to restrict attention to a low-dimensional (e.g. two-dimensional) subset of the feature space, for a specific class C.

Results indicate that ECOC can be useful for datasets with features with high class predictivity. These sets typically tend to benefit from the Modified Value Difference Metric, which creates a condensed hyperspace of features. This in turn leads to a lower number of class boundaries to be learned per bit function, which simplifies the binary subclassification tasks. A voting algorithm for learning blocks of bits proves as accurate as an expensive feature-selecting algorithm. Future research will address further mechanisms of learning complex regions of the class boundary landscape, as well as alternative error-correcting approaches to classification.
