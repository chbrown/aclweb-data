A reduced vector space model calculated from co-occurrences of word pairs provides word co-occurrence vectors. The sum of word co-occurrence vectors represents tile context of a document, and the cosine similarity between the context vector and the word co-occurrence vectors represents the ]ong-distmlce lexical dependencies. Experiments on the Mainichi Newspaper corpus show significant improve-ment in perplexity (5.070 overall and 27.2% on target vocabulary) 1 Introduction Human pattern recognition rarely handles isolated or independent objects. We recognize objects in various spatiotemporal circumstances such as an object in a scene, a word in an uttermlce. These circumstances work as conditions, eliminating ambiguities and enabling robust recognition. The most challeng-ing topics in machine pattern recognition are in what representation and to what extent those circumstances are utilized.","In laalguage processing, a context--that is; a portion of the utterance or the text before the object--is ml important circumstmlce.

The articles of six years were used for the leanfing of word co-occurrence vectors, unigrams, bigrmns and trigrams; the articles of half a year were used as a held-out data for EM re-estimation of A's; the remaining articles (half a year) for computing test set perplexities.","Word co-occurrence vectors were computed for the top 50,000 frequent content words (excluding pronouns, numerals, temporal nouns, mad light verbs) in the corpus, and unigrmn: bigrmn and trigrmn were computed for the top 60,000 frequent words.","The upper part of Table 1 shows thecomparison results of the stmldard trigram model and the context language model. For the best parameters (marked by *), the overall perplexity decreased 5.0% and the perplexity on target vocabulary (50,000 content words) decreased 27.270 relative to the standard trigram model. For the best parameters, A's were adapted as follows:","A1 = 0.08, A2 = 0.50, A3 = 0.42","Acl = 0.03, ~c2 = 0.50, Xc3 = 0.30,"]},{"title":"Xcc =","paragraphs":["0.17 Afl = 0.06, ~f2 = 0.57, A f3 = 0.37","As for parazneter settings, note that performance is decreased by using shorter word co-occurrence vector size.

Here, the context language model is based on the bigrana model, that is, the terms concerning trigrmn in Figure 4 were eliminated. The result was similar, but the perplexity decreased a bit more; 5.7% overall and 28.9% on target vocabulary.","Figure 5 shows a test article in which the probabilities of content words by the trigram lnodel aald the context model are compared. If that by the context model is bigger (i.e. the context model predicts better), the word is boxed; if not, the word is underlined.","The figure shows that the context model usually performs better after a function word, where the trigram model usually has little prediction. On the other hand, the trigram model performs better after a content word (i.e. in a compound noun) because a clear prediction by the trigram model is reduced by paying attention to the relatively vague context co-occurrence probability (Acc is 0.17).","The proposed model is a constant interpolation of a trigram model and the context co- .0ccurrence probabilities. More adaptive interpolation depending on the N-gram probability distribution may improve the performance. 5 Related Work Cache language models (Kuhn mad de Mori, 1990) boost the probability of the words already seen in the history.","Trigger models (Lau et al., 1993), even more general, try to capture the co-occurrences between words. While the basic idea of our model is similar to trigger models, they handle co-occurrences of word pairs independently and do not use a representation of the whole context. This omission is also done in applications such as word sense dismnbiguation (Yarowsky: 1994; FUNG et al., 1999).","Our model is the most related to Coccaro mad Jurafsky (1998), in that a reduced vector space approach was taken and context is represented by the accumulation of word co-occurrence vectors. Their model was reported to decrease the test set perplexity by 12%, compared to the bigram nmdel. The major differences are:","1. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) was used to reduce the matrix which is common in the Latent Semaaltic Analysis (Deerwester et ai.; 1990), and","2. context co-occurrence probabilities were computed for all words, and the degree of combination of context co-occurrence probabilities and N-gram probabilities was computed for each word, depending on its distribution over the set of doculnents.","As for the first point, we utilized the computationally-light, iteration-based procedure. One reason for this is that the computational cost of SVD is very high when millions or more documents are processed. Furthermore, considering an extension of our nmdel with a cognitive viewpoint, we believe an iteration-based model seems more reasonable than an algebraic model such as SVD.","As for the second point, we doubt the appropriateness to use the word's distribution as a measure of combination of two models. What we need to do is to distinguish words to which semantics should be considered and other words. We judged the distinction of content words and function words is good enough for that purpose, and developed their trigram-based distinction as shown in Figure 4.","Several topic-based models have been proposed based on the observation that certain words tend to have different probability distributions in different topics. For example, Florian and Yarowsky (1999) proposed the following model: t"]},{"title":"(9)","paragraphs":["where t denotes a topic id.
