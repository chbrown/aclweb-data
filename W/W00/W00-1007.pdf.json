Then I present an adaptation to Danish of Eckert and Strube's algorithm for resolving anaphora referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues (Eckert and Strube, 1999b; Eckert and Strube, 1999a). The adapted algorithm is tested on four Danish dialogues from two dialogue collections and the results obtained are evaluated. .1 Introduction Many natural language processing applications involve the complex task of resolving anaphora. Different strategies for anaphora resolution have been proposed, some exclusively relying on the syntactic structure of discourse, some including semantic and pragmatic constraints, some based on statistical methods. One of the most popular approaches to anaphora resolution is centering (Grosz et al., 1995), henceforth GJW95, which accounts for the relation between the saliency of entities in discourse and the use of referring expressions, incorporating syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Centering fits into Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). In this model a discourse is composed of segments which exhibit"]},{"title":"global","paragraphs":["coherence. A discourse","1This work has been carried out under Staging, an on-going Danish project funded by the Danish Research Councils. segment, on the other hand, is composed of a sequence of utterances which exhibit"]},{"title":"local","paragraphs":["coherence. This latter phenomenon is accounted for by centering theory. Centering predicts that there is a connection between the coherence of a referring expression and the inference load necessary to resolve it. Although Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein recognize that many factors determine the prominence of entities in an utterance, in GJW95 this prominence is established simply by the linear order of the entities in the utterance. Different centering algorithms have been presented, spelling out the strategy described in GJW95, extending the theory to more linguistic phenomena or specifying the concept of prominence of discourse entities. Strube and Hahn (Strube, 1998; Strube and H~.hn, 1999) in particular, calculate prominence considering the information structure of the utterances (functional centering). 2 The prominence ranking they adopt does not exclusively rely on word order, which is language dependent. Moreover GJW95 only dealt with intersentential anaphora, while Strnbe and Hahn account for both intrasentential and intersentential, pronominal and nominal anaphora, a","Centering-based algorithms have been tested on written texts. Recently they have also been applied to written dialogues. Byron and Stent (1998), in particular, test centering on multi-party dialogues. They conclude that centering seems to be a valid theory also in this case, but it must be extended to ac-","2In (Strube and Hah~ 1996) a functional-based prominence ranking has been proposed.","SAn other extension of the centering framework to intrasentential anaphora has been proposed by Kameyama (1998). 56 count for dialogne-specific aspects such as the definition of utterance boundaries, the specification of a strategy for tackling partial utterances and including discourse participants in the list of relevant discourse entities.","Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), henceforth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolving anaphors referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues. The algorithm is based on rules for discriminating among the two types of anaphor based on the predicative contexts in which the anaphors occur. The individual anaphors are then resolved by the functional centering algorithm described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract anaphors are resolved with a different algorithm. ES99 test the approach on selected dialogues and obtain a precision of 63,6% for discourse deictics and 66,2% for individual anaphors. They report that most errors are due to the inability to distinguish between discourse deictics and pronouns which vaguely refer to concepts in the preceding discourse (vague anaphors). Another cause of error is the lack of information about abstract nominals. I believe that the strategy followed by ES99 is a good starting point for investigating how far one can go in resolving individual and abstract anaphors in dialogues on the basis of the local contexts in which the anaphors occur. I have adapted the algorithm so it accounts for Danish data and have applied it to Danish dialogues. 4","In section 2 I shortly present the original centering framework and functional centering as described in (Strube, 1998), $98.

Is have semantic content, while As are only used to ground the preceding I. Acknowledgments/Initiations (A/Is) are dialogue acts that have both the function of grounding the preceding I and that of establishing a new I. An I and the correspond-ing A, together with longer Is in the same turn-taking which do not need to be acknowledged, constitute a Synchronizing Unit (SU). Short Is which are not acknowledged are ignored by the resolution algorithms.","ES99 follow i.a. (Webber, 1991) in assum-ing that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves reference coercion and that only discourse sections adjacent to the anaphor or, using Webber's terminology, sections on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree, are available for discourse-deictic reference. Like (Asher, 1993) they assume that the type of abstract object is determined by the context in which the anaphor occurs. Anaphora referring to abstract objects are resolved using a list, the A-list. The A-list is only filled when discourse deictics occur and its elements remain for one I. The parts of the linguistic contexts are accessed in the following order: 1. the A-list; 2. in the same I the clause to the left of the clause which contains the anaphor; 3. within the previous I the rightmost main clause and subordinated clauses to its right; 4. within previous Is the rightmost complete sentence, if previous I is an incomplete sentence.","The anaphora resolution algorithm for third person singular neuter personal pronouns is the following (Eckert and Strube, 1999a):","case PRO is I-incompatible if"]},{"title":"resolveDiscourseDeictic(P RO ) then","paragraphs":["classify as discourse deictic else classify as vague pronoun;","case PRO is A-incompatible if"]},{"title":"resolveIndividual (PRO ) then","paragraphs":["classify as individual pronoun else classify as vague pronoun;","case PRO is ambiguous if"]},{"title":"resolveIndividual(PRO ) then","paragraphs":["classify as individual pronoun else if"]},{"title":"resolveDiscourseDeictic(PRO) then","paragraphs":["classify as discourse deictic else classify as vague pronoun;","The same algorithm is used for demonstratives, with the exception that the last two if constructions in the algorithm for pronouns are reversed reflecting the preference for demonstratives to be discourse deictics (Webber, 1991). 4 Danish Data In this section I shortly describe Danish third person personal and possessive pronouns and demonstrative pronouns.

They can also refer to a few common person nouns in neuter gender, such as barn (child) and menneske (person) if the sex of the person is unknown or irrelevant (syntactic agreement). In case the sex is known or relevant, the appropriate feminine or masculine pronouns are used (semantic agreement). The two cases are illustrated in the following examples: barnet var pd millimeter sd stort det skulle v,~re i l,~ngden og i hovedstcrrelsen og... (the child was precisely as high as it ought to be and its head was as big as it ought to and... ) sd ch... jeg kunne gd ud ]or jeg havde mit barnebarn reed pd tre et halvt dr sd..., kunne jeg jo bare holde hami hdnden (so oh...

In this case the choice between the singular den or det and plural de depends on whether the speaker focuses on the collective meaning or on the individuals. Det and in few idiomatic expressions den are also used as expletives.","In Danish the most frequently used discourse deictic is det which corresponds to it, this or that. Other discourse deictics are det her (this) and det der (that). These two deictics can be used in most of the same contexts as det, although there seems to be a preference for using them to refer to several clauses. The neuter demonstrative dette (this) has also a discourse deictic use, but is mostly used in written language. I did not found any occurrences of it in the three dialogue collections.","As discourse deictic det refers to an infinitive or a clause, as it is the case in the following examples: At ryge er ]arligt og det er ogsd dyrt (Smoking is dangerous and it is also expensive) A: Du skal rage en blodprcve (You have to take a blood test) B: Hvorffor det?"]},{"title":"(Why that.*)","paragraphs":["Det is also used as the subject complement of vmre (be) and blive (become) in answers.

Some examples are copula constructions like x er godt/ddrligt (x is good/bad), and objects of verbs such as elske (love), hade (hate), foretraekke (prefer). To partially accomodate this, I have added the following condition to the algorithm: in the above cases the anaphor is classified as A* incompatible unless the previous clause contain.~ a raising adjective construction in which case it is considered I* incompatible. Consider the fi)llowing two examples: Peter boede iet r~dt hus. Det hadede han. (Peter lived in a red house. He hated it.) Deter dcdsygt at sidde pd et vaskeri. Det hader jeg. (It is boring to be in a laundry. I hate it)","In the first example the algorithm chooses et r~dt hus (a red house) as the antecedent of det, while in the second example the algorithm chooses at sidde pd et vaskeri (being in a laundry) instead of et vaskeri. There are cases, similar to the first example, where it is impossible, without a deeper analysis of the discourse to determine whether an anaphor refers to an individual NP or an abstract object.","In the test I have taken into account the metaphorical uses of verbs encoded in a semantic lexicon, the Danish SIMPLE lexicon (Pedersen and Nimb, 2000).","From the analysis of anaphors in the considered dialogue collections I found that many individual anaphors refer back to entities which have not been evoked in the immediately preceding utterances (SUs) and thus they would not be on the S-list (the entities which are not evoked in the current SU are removed from the list). Thus I have extended the scope of resolution for all individual anaphors except the neutral singular. If an antecedent to an individual NP cannot be resolved by looking at the actual S-list, the elements on the S-lists for the preceding SUs are considered. 13 6 Evaluation of the Algorithm I have applied the modified ES99-algorithm to three randomly selected SL dialogues (6,305 words) and to one of the dialogues between native Danes recorded in the PID collection (5,367 words). It must be noted that in my test only one annotator (the author) identiffed dialogue acts, classified the anaphors in the dialogues, marked NPs and anaphor antecedents. In (Eckert and Strube, 1999a) these tasks have been accomplished by two annotators.","In dividing the three SL dialogues into discourse segments I have mainly used a parti-tion made by two researchers at the University of Copenhagen in an independent project.

Most of the instances of wrongly classified anaphors are due to the fact that the algorithm classifies vague anaphors as discourse deictics and then resolves the anaphor to a preceding predicate or clause. Few errors are due to the fact, already noticed by ES99, that the defined I* and A* predicates do not contain information about nominals referring to abstract objects. 15 These errors resulted in most cases in resolution errors.","Some errors are due to the inability to find 14The dialogue collections have been tagged. 15The semantic lexicon I used did not contain the","relevant nominals. an individual NP antecedent to the pronoun"]},{"title":"det,","paragraphs":["when this refers generally to an NP of different gender 16 and to wrongly resolved plural pronouns with complex NP antecedents or with no antecedent.

The latter kind of errors are chaining errors. In table 7 the occurrences of each type of error are reported. 7 Concluding Remarks The adapted ES99-algorithm has been tested on two kinds of dialogue, that have been classifted by one annotator. Although the types of dialogue in the Danish test is quite different from that used by ES99, the results reported in the previous section (6) indicate that the algorithm performs as well for Danish as for Enghsh. Because the use of Danish pronouns, especially those referring to abstract objects, is different from the English one, these results provide an interesting evaluation of the algorithm.","As noticed by ES99, adding more lexical knowledge to the algorithm could improve its performance.
