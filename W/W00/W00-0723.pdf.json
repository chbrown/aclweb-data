Universitat Polit~cnica de Catalunya Jordi Girona Salgado, 1-3 E-08034 Barcelona - Spain 1 Introduction The growing availability of on-line text has led to an increase in the use of automatic knowledge acquisition approaches from textual data. In fact, a number of Information Extraction (IE) systems has emerged in the past few years in relation to the MUC conferences 1. The aim of an IE system consists in automatically extract-ing pieces of information from text, being this information relevant for a set of prescribed concepts (scenario). One of the main drawbacks of applying IE systems is the high cost involved in manually adapting them to new domains and text styles.","In recent years, a variety of Machine Learning (ML) techniques has been used to improve the portability of IE systems to new domains, as in SRV (Freitag, 1998), RAPIER (Califf and Mooney, 1997), LIEP (Huffman, 1996), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995) and WHISK (Soderland, 1999) . However, some drawbacks remain in the portability of these systems: a) existing systems generally depend on the supported text style and learn IE-rules either for structured texts, semi-structured texts or free text , b) IE systems are mostly single-concept learning systems, c) consequently, an extractor (e.g., a rule set) is learned for each concept within the scenario in an independent manner, d) the order of execution of the learners is set manually, and so are the scheduling and way of combination of the resulting extractors, and e) focusing on the training data, the size of available training corpora can be inadequate to accurately learn extractors for all the concepts within the scenario 2. 1 http://www.muc.saic.com/ ~This is so when dealing with some combinations of","text style and domain.","This paper describes EVIUS, a multi-concept learning system for free text that follows a multi-strategy constructive learning approach (MCL) (Michalshi, 1993) and supports insufficient amounts of training corpora. EVIUS is a component of a multilingual IE system, M-TURBIO (Turmo et al., 1999).","2 EVIUS. Learning rule sets for a set of related concepts The input of EVIUS is both a partially-parsed semantically-tagged 3 training corpus and a description of the desired target structure. This description is provided as a set of concepts C related to a set of asymmetric binary relations, T~.","In order to learn set S of IE rule sets for the whole C, EVIUS uses an MCL approach integrating constructive learning, closed-loop learning and deductive restructuring (Ko, 1998).","In this multi-concept situation, the system determines which concepts to learn and, later, incrementally updates S. This can be relatively straightforward when using knowledge about the target structure in a closed-loop learning approach.

Thus, the system tries to improve recall by growing set g+ with artificial examples (pseudo-examples), as explained in 3.2. A new execution of FOIL is done by using the new g+. The resulting rule set 7~ is combined with T~0 in order to create 7¢1 by appending the new rules from T¢~ to 7¢0. Consequently, the recall value of 7~1 is forced to be at least equal to that of 7~0, although the accuracy can decrease. A better method seems to be the merging of rules from 7~ and TO0 by studying empirical subsumptions. This last combination allows to create more compact and accurate rule sets.","EVIUS uses an incremental learning approach to learn rule sets for each concept. This is done by iterating the process above while uncovered examples remain and the F1 score increment (AF1) is greater than pre-defined constant a: select g+ and generate g-7~0 = FOIL(g+,g -) $u + = uncover ed_ f r om ( 7~o )","= (7¢o) while $u + ~ 0 and AF1 > a do g+ = g+ U pseudo-examples($u +) T¢~ = FOIL(E+,g -) T~i+ l = combine_rules(7~i,T¢~) gu + = uncovered_f rom( TQ+ l )","= El(hi+l) - El(hi) endwhile if AF1 > a then return"]},{"title":"\"~i+1","paragraphs":["else return 7~i endi/ 3.1 Generating relevant negative","examples Negative examples can be defined as any combination of terminal nodes out of g+. However, this approach produces an extremely large number of examples, out of which only a small subset is relevant to learn the concept. Related to this, (Freitag, 1998) uses words to learn only slot rules (learned from text-relation examples) , selecting as negative those non-positive word pairs that define a string as neither longer than the maximum length in positive examples, nor shorter than the minimum.","A more general approach is adopted to define the distance between possible examples in the learning Space, applying a clustering method using positive examples as medoids s. The N nearest non-positive examples to each medoid can be selected as negative ones. Distance, in our case, must be defined as multidimensional due to the typology of occurring features. It is relatively easy to define distances between examples for word_X and lemma_X predicates, being 1 when X values are equal, and 0 otherwise. For isa_X predicates, the minimum of all possible conceptual distances (Agirre and Rigau, 1995) between X values in EWN has been used. Greater difficulty is encountered when defining a distance from a morpho-syntactic point of view (e.g., a pronoun seems to be closer to a noun than a verb). In (Turmo et al., 1999), the concept of 5-set has been presented as a syntactic relation generalization, and a distance measure has been based on this concept. 3.2 Creating pseudo-examples A method has been used inspired by the generation of convex pseudo data (Breiman, 1998), in which a similar process to gene-combination in genetic algorithms is used.","For each positive example c(A1,... ,An) 9 of concept c to be dealt with, an attribute vector is defined as ( word--X Bl ,. . . ,word._X B~ ,lemma-X sl ,..., lemma_X B~ ,sem-X B1 ,... ,sem_X B~ ,context) where B1,..., Bn are the unrepeated terminal nodes from A1,..., An, context is the set of all predicates subsumed by the syntactico-semantic structure between the nearest positive example on the left and the nearest one on the right, and sem_XB~ is the list of isa_X and has_hypernym_X predicates for Bi.","Then, for each example uncovered by the rule set learned by FOIL, a set of pseudo-examples is generated. A pseudo-example is built by combining both the uncovered example vector and a randomly selected covered one. This is done as follows: for each dimension, one of both possible values is randomly selected as value for the pseudo-example.
