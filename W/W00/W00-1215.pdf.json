Compared with others, this scheme can fully differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but hold different meanings due to their different word order or some involved function words, and capture the hierarchical conceptual structure of Chinese phrases, which underlies their main semantic information. We also give the guidelines for annotating various commonly used types of Chinese phrases."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Semantically annotated linguistic data are important resources for natural language processing, and have been used in many NLP areas, e.g., parsing, word sense disambiguation, co-reference resolution and information extraction, etc. But due to huge efforts needed in building them and general difficulties in dealing with semantic information, such resources are scarcely seen for most languages including Chinese, if not all.","In this paper, we focus on Chinese phrases and present a recursive graph based scheme for their semantic annotation. Compared with the same task for sentences, it only involves a relatively small data set and simple semantic information but has potential generality and application. One is at which goal the annotation is aimed. In our case, the goal is established to be to help disclose the correspondence between linguistic forms and meaning, which is also the primary goal in both traditional linguistic research (Chomsky, 1968) and natural language understanding (Allen, 1995).","The other problem is whether the annotation can significantly contribute to the established goal. In our case, the answer is of course positive. First, the phrases themselves are a specific kind of linguistic forms, thus their semantic annotation directly provides the correspondence between them and their meanings. Second, by some kinds of analogy rules, these annotated phrases can be examples for deriving the correspondence between new phrases and their meanings.

In general, semantic annotation of linguistic forms is to associate with them their 101 semantic information being represented in some formal languages or diagrams.

But the two content words can only form two dependent trees, listed in 6) and 7). 1 In this paper, whenever listing a Chinese word, we always list its Pinyin included within two symbols 7', and its English translation. For a Chinese phrase, we furthermore list its English translation when necessary."]},{"title":"6)","paragraphs":["~ (/qiche/, car)"]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["~L(/zousi/, smuggle)"]},{"title":"7)","paragraphs":[";~ ~ (/zousi/, smuggle)"]},{"title":"t (/qich , car)","paragraphs":["Obviously, these two dependent trees cannot code the three meanings listed in 3), 4) and 5).

Consider other two phrases 9) and 10)."]},{"title":"9)","paragraphs":["/zousi/ /jituan/ smuggle bloc smuggling bloc 10) /qiche/ /zousi/ /jituan/ car smuggle bloc car smuggling bloc Intuitively, the word :~l~/L(/zousi/, smuggle) in 2) holds the same meaning as the word in 10), which subsequently is equivalent with the same word in 9). On the other hand, there is no reason to treat the same word","~L (/zousi/, smuggle) semantically differently in 1) and 9), two typical noun 2 To differentiate the two words, we add one quotation mark. 102 phrases. Particularly, they are both followed by a typical noun in the two phrases.","The second problem for dependent tree to semantically annotate linguistic forms is that due to its tree nature, it cannot represent multi-dependence relationship, in which one node is controlled by several nodes. For example, consider 11). 11) /xihuan/ /ziji/ /de/ /ren/","like self of people the people who like oneself Conventionally, its dependent tree should be 12). 12) ~ (/ren/, people) gX (/xihuan/, like) ~ (/ziji/, self) But intuitively, there should be some dependence relationship between )k(/ren/, people) and fl ~ (/ziji/, self). If we add this relationship, it will become a graph. 2.2 Conceptual Graph Conceptual graph is another diagram for semantic annotation of linguistic forms, which comprises concepts and conceptual relationship denoted by linguistic forms (Eklund, 1996). Although it is claimed to be a directed graph in its original form, it is equivalent to an undirected graph in nature, with its relationship nodes and their directed edges replaced with an undirected edge to directly denote the relationship.","One problem with this diagram for semantic annotation is that it cannot code the information about head, if any, in a linguistic form, which intuitively specifies the main information carried by a linguistic form. This will lead to severe problems when using the graph to represent linguistic forms. For example, both phrases 1) and 2) with all three meanings 3), 4) and 5) would be represented by the same diagram as in 13) 3 .","13) ~/~ ~:~ (/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)","To differentiate the three meanings held by the two phrases, we suggest using the following two weighted graphs and one unweighted graph, i.e., 14), 15) and 16) to represent 3), 4) and 5) respectively.","14) ~$L ~ (/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)"]},{"title":"15, I I","paragraphs":["(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) 16) [ ~t~L ~ (/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) Here we basically use undirected graphs to annotate phrases, and introduce a rectangle to denote the head of a linguistic phrase, if any. Notice that we don't mark a head in 14), which means that we don't take the verb ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) as the head of the verb phrase as usual. In general, for most verb phrases like 14) in Chinese, they correspond with two modifier-center phrases like 15) and 16) that comprise the same content words but with different meanings. For such phrases, we generally use a headword to differentiate between the verb phrase and the two modifier-center phrases, and then use different headword to distinguish the two modifier-center phrases.","Another problem with conceptual structure is concerned with its ability to deal with hierarchical structures. Although nested conceptual structure is introduced to 3 Unless necessary, we don't list relationship in the conceptual graph. 103 describe nested belief, one particular kind of hierarchical structures (Genevirve, 1998), some simple hierarchical structures cannot be distinguished or annotated appropriately. As an example, consider 17) and 18).","17) ~ ~ ~L ~ /piaoliang/ /de/ /zousi/ /qiche/ beautiful of smuggle car beautiful smuggled cars","18) ~I~L ~., ~ ~ /zousi/ /piaoliang/ /de/ /qiche/ smuggle beautiful of car to smuggle beautiful cars Using conceptual graph, we can annotate both of them as 19), in which case the two phrases cannot be distinguished. 19) ~t~L~ ~~~ If based on undirected graph plus head, 17) can be annotated as 20)."]},{"title":"20,","paragraphs":["But there will be no appropriate annotation for 18), because on the one hand, ~(/qiche/,car) should be coded as a head due to its relationship with ~g~(/piaoliang/, beautiful), on the other hand, it's role as the object of the verb ~L(/zousi/, smuggle) makes it illegal to be a head.","To differentiate 17) and 18), we further suggest specifying the embedded structures in linguistic forms in some way, and use circles to denote them. In such opinion, 17) can be annotated as 21) and 22) respectively. 21) ~ In this diagram, the smaller rectangle denotes the head of the modifier-center phrase ~$/L~ (/zousiqiche/, smuggled cars), the circle codes the phrase as an embedded structure of the whole phrase, while bigger rectangle denotes the head of the whole phrase. 22) :xT~ ~L~ In this diagram, the circle denotes the embedded structure $~,;~~(/piaofiang de qiche/, beautiful cars), while the rectangle denotes the head of the embedded structure.

Recursive Graph","paragraphs":["One major concern for semantic annotation of linguistic forms is what semantic information will be coded, or more generally, what is their semantic information, which has long been a quite controversial question. From the point of view of concepts, linguistic forms including phrases semantically refer to concepts, which we think generally fall within four categories:"]},{"title":"a)","paragraphs":["preliminary concept.

Notice that the concepts within one situation themselves may be compositional concepts, subordinate concepts or subordinate features, so the concepts that linguistic forms including phrases denote generally presents a kind of hierarchical structure. In fact, this hierarchical structure in return represents the main semantic information of linguistic forms.","We introduce recursive graph as formal diagram to represent the hierarchical structure of linguistic forms.

Annotation Guidelines","paragraphs":["In general, Chinese phrases can roughly be classified into five categories, i.e., sub-predicate, verb-object, modifier-center, verb-complement, and coordinate.

This scheme can fully differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but with different meaning due to their different word order or some involved function words. It can also capture the hierarchical conceptual structures of Chinese phrases, which determine their main semantic information.","Now, we have annotated about 5,000 Chinese phrases using this scheme. One methodological issue is that we also choose multi-character Chinese words as candidate annotation phrases. The reason is that unlike western languages, there is no clear-cut between words and phrases in Chinese, for most multi-character Chinese words, their components may also be words, and the meaning of the multi-character words tends to be strongly related with that of their component words. In this sense, the words can be treated as basic phrases. More importantly, such basic annotation examples can be more complete in the sense of coverage.","Future work will extend to 50,000 Chinese phrases. Another future work is to learn the rules that dete~ne the mapping between linguistic forms and meanings based on this annotation, and apply the rules to new phrases and sentences. If this can be successful, we can develop a semantic analyzer for Chinese without any syntactic analysis. In particular, we can avoid part-of-speeches or syntactic structures that have long been difficult notions for Chinese languages."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I would like to thank Prof. Dong Zhendong and Prof. Huang Changning for their 107 insightful discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for their comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.Allen, Natural 'Language Understanding, Second Edition, the Benj arnirgCurnming Publishing Company, INC, 1995.
