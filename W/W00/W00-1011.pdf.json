Watson Research Center,","Hawthorne, NY 10532, USA","jchai@us.ibm.com Abstract The learning and self-adaptive capability in dialog systems has become increasingly important with the advances in a wide range of applications. For any application, particularly the one dealing with a technical domain, the system should pay attention to not only the user experience level and dialog goals, but more importantly, the mechanism to adapt the system behavior to the evolving state of the user. This paper describes a methodology that first identifies the user experience level and utility metrics of the goal and sub-goals, then automatically adjusts those parameters based on discourse history and thus directs adaptive dialog management. Introduction A new generation of dialog systems should be viewed as learning systems rather than static models (Jokinen, 2000). Close-world and static approaches have tremendous limitations and often fail when the task becomes complex and the application environment and knowledge changes. Thus, the learning capability of a dialog system has become an important issue. It has been addressed in many different aspects including dynamic construction of mutual knowledge (Andersen et al, 1999), learning of speech acts (Stolcker et al, 1998), learning optimal strategies (Litman et al, 1998; Litman et al, 1999; Walker et al, 1998), collaborative agent in plan recognition (Lesh et al, 1999), etc. This paper addresses the dynamic user modeling and dialog-goal utility measurement to facilitate adaptive dialog behavior. For any dialog system dealing with a technical domain, such as repair support (Weis, 1997), help-desk support, etc, it is crucial for the system not only to pay attention to the user knowledge and experience level and dialog goals, but more important, to have certain mechanisms that adapt the system behavior in terms of action planning, content selection, and content realization to user cognitive limitations. Dialog strategies and management should be adjusted to the evolving state of the user. Thus a better understanding and modeling of user cognitive process and human perception is desirable. In this paper, we propose a methodology that automatically learns user experience levels based on sub-goal utilities and characteristics observed during the interaction. Those user levels will further feedback to update utility metrics and direct different dialog strategies at each level of dialog management: action planning, content selection and content realization. The Help-Desk is our application domain. This is a work in progress. We have built a prototype system and are currently in the process of evaluation of our methodology and hypotheses. 1 System Overview The system components, shown in figure 1, consist of a problem space representation and a set of modules and agents that utilize this representation. The architecture supports a dynamic updating process for user level and sub-goal utility measurement, and thus allows the system to adapt its dialog behavior to the updated environment. 94 ~(~o r~nt ,~decdoll Iloa Lq4 -"]},{"title":"1 1","paragraphs":["r I i i"]},{"title":"Figure 1.

It can also be considered as a forest containing joint trees that have overlapped root nodes and internal nodes. Internal nodes correspond to sub-goals. A path traversed from a root to a particular node contains a potential solution to a goal or sub-goal related to that node. Given a root node, the ffurffier away from the root, the greater is the complexity of the goal (or sub-goal) represented by a node. Since multiple paths can lead to a node, there could be multiple solutions to a goal. Figure 2 is a fragment of an acyclic graph for solving problems pertaining to a Windows based PC. In this example, three paths correspond to three potential solutions to the problem about how to set the display resolution of a monitor.","A C Concept:.

Acyclie Problem Graph","paragraphs":["Each node in the graph has the following fields: Concept Name, Remedy, and Utility Metrics that include Reward, Punishment, Best-case timeout and Worst-case firneout. Concept Name represents an instruction corresponding to a particular goal or sub-goal during the problem solving. For example, the concept of \"Display Properties\" node deals with manipulating the display of the monitor. Remedy is the template that is used to generate natural language responses and explanations corresponding to a particular goal. It also contains phrases and key terms used for language generation. Reward and Punishment are the utility metrics corresponding to each sub-goal (Winlder,"]},{"title":"95","paragraphs":["1972) depending upon the ]hypothesis of uncertainty of understanding and the level of importance. Uncertainty of understanding implies the difficulty in following certain instructions or understanding certain concepts. For example, some technical terms require users to possess greater expertise in order to comprehend them. Some potential ways of initializing uncertainty of unders.tanding are by observation, analysis of previously logged data, or surveys. The level of importance indicates the importance of the sub-goal for understanding an instruction or a concept towards the realization of the overall goal of solving the problem. One good indication of such importance, for example, in the Acyclic Problem Graph, is the branch factor of each node. A more difficult concept has a greater level of uncertainty and hence would lead to less punishment if the user does not understand it. On the other hand, if a user correctly understands a concept that has a high degree of uncertainty, he would be rewarded highly. Reward and punishment can be predetermined and then re-adjusted later when the user and the group modeling progresses. Timeout metrics are used to indicate whether the user understands the instruction or the concept associated With the sub-goal within the expected period of time. The hypothesis is that when a user has no problem of understanding a system instruction, the user is very likely to respond to the system rapidly. However, when the user has difficulties, he/she tends to spend more time on thinking and asking for help. There are two timeouts: best-case and worst-case. Each timeout has a reward and a punishment. Best-case time is the time expected by the system, in the best ease, that a user would take to understaud the instruction. The user is rewarded when actual time spent is less than the best-case time. Similarly, the worst-case time is the system expectation for the worst ease. If the user still doesn't get the instruction after the worst-ease time period, he is punished for it. Again, these values are pre-set and will be dynamically reeadjusted. 3 Dialog Management The Dialog Manager can be broadly classified into two main modules: Content Selection and Content Realization. 3.1 Content Selection Module The Content Selection Module consists of four components: Level-Adjusting Agent, Utility-Updating Agent, Action Planner and Content Selector. & L1 The Level-Adjusting Agent There are three levels of user expertise that the dialog manager takes into consideration: Expert, Moderate and Novice. The agent controls the initial detection and dynamic shifting of user expertise level based on interactions with the user. If a user is using the system for the first time, a good indication of the initial user expertise level is the level of detail and technical complexity of the initial query. As user's interaction with the system continues, a profile of the user is constructed gradually. This profile could be re-used to set the initial user expertise when the user uses the system again. The dynamic shifting of user expertise level is of two kinds: local (i.e., temporary) shifting between local expertise levels and accumulated (i.e., long term) shifting between accumulated expertise levels. Local shifting adjusts the expertise level temporarily - by observing the user confirmation (currently an explicit user confirmation is expected) which indicates whether he/she understands a certain instruction. The reason for temporary adjustment is because we assume that the user is having trouble understanding only this particular instruction and not the overall solution. The accumulated shifting permauently adjusts the user expertise level depending upon two threshold values: EXPERTLEVEL and NOVICELEVEL. The user is considered an expert when his accumulated expertise level is above the EXPERTLEVEL and is considered 96 novice when that is below the NOVICE_LEVEL. The user is assumed to have moderate expertise if he lies between these two thresholds. An accumulated value (ACCUM_VALUE) is calculated based on the whole dialog history. If the ACCUiVLVALUE of a user crosses a threshold, the accumulated user expertise level changes long term as it is assumed that there is a change in the user's overall understanding of the solution. At any point of the interaction, the system maintains ACCUM VALUE for the user. This value is used to adjust the user expertise level. The ACCUM VALUE is calculated based on the following set of features associated with utility metrics in each node in the discourse history (Wies, 1997; Jameson et al, 1999): Sub-goal Complexity: More complex sub-goals have a greater level of importance and uncertainty of understanding, and thus have a high reward and a low punishment. Similarly, comparably simple sub-goals have a low reward and a high punishment. Accomplishing Time: this is perhaps the trickiest parameter as the chance of making an incorrect assumption is much higher. The user response time could be a good indication of user understanding. The longer the resolving of the user's problems lasts, the more unfavorable the evaluation is. Also if the user responds quickly, he is rewarded for it. To detect whether the user is distracted or not, if a series of timeouts occur continuously, the user is not paying attention to the system. Response Complexity: There is a reward and a punishment associated with each system response that reflects the complexity of the content and realization of the system responses. First of all, the content for response generation varies with different expertise levels. For novice users, all the content on the solution path will be generated as several turns of responses based on the number of sub-goals in the path. For expert users, only 40% content on the solution path (toward the final goal) is used for the generation as one response. Furthermore, for users with different expertise level, the Content Realization Module will generate system responses (in the prototype system, the system responses are mainly instructions that guide users to solve a help-desk problem) with different levels of syntactic complexity and technical details. For example, for novice users, the system tends to generate responses with single instruction corresponding to one sub-goal, while for expert users, the system tends to generate responses with single instruction corresponding to multiple sub-goals on the solution path. The response with multiple instructions will have higher reward and lower punishment than those are associated with single instruction. Thus the user who gives a positive confirmation to a more complex system response will be rewarded higher than those who understand a simple system response. Based on the above factors, the ACCUM VALUE can be calculated depending upon the conditions using the following formulae: ACCUM VALUE = ACCUlvLVALUE + f/response -complexity (reward, punishment), sub-goal(reward, punishmen0, timeout(reward, punishment)] In the prototype system, we have used the following: If a goal is accomplished by the user(indicated by positive user confirmation), ACCUM_VALUE = ACCUM...VALUE + [response-complexity(reward) * sub-goal(reward)] If a goal is not accomplished(indicated by negative user confirmation), ACCUM_VALUE = ACCUM. VALUE [response-complexity(punishment) * sub-goal(punishment)] If a goal is accomplished before best-time timeout value, ACCUM_VALUE = ACCUM_VALUE + [response-complexity(reward) * sub-goal(best-case timeout reward)]. If a goal is not accomplished before worst-time timeout value, ACCUMVALUE = ACCUM.VALUE - [response-complexity(punishment) * sub-goal(worst-ease timeout punislament)]. Other variations of the formula are expected to be explored in the future. 97 3.L 2 Action Planner and Content Selector The Action Planner identifies the final goal node in the Acyclic Problem Graph and finds the optimal path to it.

This algorithm recursively applies a divide and conquer mechanism to accomplish the final goal by resolving sub-goals. Two variables (i,e., local expertise level and accumulated expertise level) are maintained by the Level-Adjusting Agent for the automated level updating. The Action Planner identifies the goal node and the solution path to it depending on the expertise level of the user. Based on this level, the Content Realization Module will first select the content on the path to be presented and then use various response strategies to generate and display system instructions to the user. For novice users, all the content on solution path will be used; for moderate and expert users, only partial content on the path (toward the goal) will be used. In terms of generation, for novice and moderate expertise users, the system generates responses with single instruction corresponding to one sub-goal, while for expert users, the system tends to generate responses with single instruction corresponding to multiple sub-goals on the solution path. The syntax of the response becomes more complex as the expertise level increases.

This is because a decrease in accumulated user expertise level has taken place in step 5. Also, the style of the dialog is different at each level according to the expertise level of the user at that time. Conclusion This paper describes hypotheses, strategies and a methodology in building a dialog system that adapts itself to the evolving level of user expertise. Furthermore, the system allows automated sub-goal utility adjusmaent based on history of interactions with groups of users. We have implemented the algorithm described in this paper on a prototype system where the utility metrics have been initialized manually by a help-desk expert, based on his experiences of interaction with users. We are currently working on evaluation of hypotheses and the system. This work is still in its early stage. Our future work includes conducting evaluation of the hypotheses and the system and investigating machine learning techniques for improving utility adjustments.
