Here we discuss the architecture of an interactive editing tool that, on top of techniques common to most Translation Memory-based systems, applies the potential of SGML's DTDs to guide the process of bilingual document generation. Rather than employing just simple task-oriented mark-up, we selected a set of TEI's highly complex and versatile collection of tags to help disclose the underlying logical structure of documents in the test-corpus. DTDs were automatically induced and later in-tegrated in the editing tool to provide the basic scheme for new documents. 1 Introduction This paper discusses an approach to the architecture of an experimental interactive editing tool that integrates the processes of source document composition and translation into the target language. The tool has been conceived as an optimal solution for a particular case of bilingual production of legal documentation, but it also illustrates in a more general way how to exploit the possibilities of SGML (ISO8879, 1986) used extensively to annotate a whole range of linguistic and extralinguistic information in specialized bilingual corpora.","SGML is well established as the coding scheme underlying most Translation Memory based systems (TMBS), and has been proposed as the cod-it~g scheme for the interchange of existing Translation Memory databases Translation Meinories eXchange, TMX (Melby, 1998). The advantages of SGML have also been perceived by a large conmmnity of corpus linguistics researchers, and big efforts have been made in the development of suitable markup options to encode a variety of textual types and functions -as clearly demonstrated by the Text Encoding Initiative, TEI; (Burnard & Speberg-MacQueen, 1995). While the tag-sets employed by TMBS are simple and task-oriented, TEI has offered a highly complex and versatile collection of tags. The guiding hypothesis in our experi-ment has been the idea that it is possible to explore TEI/SGML markup in order to develop a system that carries the concept of Translation Memory one step further. One important leature of SGML is the DTD. DTDs determine the logical structure of documents and how to tag them accordingly. We have concentrated on the accurate description of documents by means of TEI conformant SGML markup. The markup will help disclose the underlying logical structure of documents. From annotated documentation, DTDs can be induced and these DTDs provide the basic scheme to produce new documents. We have collected a corpus of official publications from three main institutions in the Basque Autonomous Region in Spain, the Boletln Oficial de Bizkaia (BOB, 1990-1995), Botetln Oficial de Alava (BOA, 1990-1994) and Bolet{n Oficial del Pais Vasco (BOPV, 1995). Documents in the corpus were composed by Adnfinistration clerks and translated by translators. Both clerks and translators have been using a wide variety of word-processors, although since 1994 MSWord has been generalized as the standard editing tool. Administrative documentation shows a regular structure, and is rich • in*recurrent textual patterns. For each docu- ..... ment type different document tokens share a common global distribution of elements. Official document composers learn these global structures and apply them consistently. It is also the case that composers tend to reuse old 32 Document Type Orden Form Decreto..Foral =-- Resolucidn Extracto Acuerdo Norma Foral Anuncio"]},{"title":"% 53%","paragraphs":["..22%,;- 13% 5.4% 3.4% 1.9%"]},{"title":"0.4%","paragraphs":["documents, where the whole document may be considered the translation unit.

Good software packages for TM1 and TM3 already exist in the market, and hence their exploitation is Table I: document files when producing new documents of the same type. Despite the fact that no SGML software was used at the editing phase, texts in the corpus show regular logical structures and consistent distribution of text segments. Our main goal in tagging the corpus was to make all them explicit (Martinez, 1997). The most common type of document in the corpus, the"]},{"title":"Orden Foral,","paragraphs":["was chosen (see Table 1). We analysed some 100 tokens and hand-marked the most salient elements. The heuristics to identify these elements were later expressed in a collection of recognition routines in Perl and tested against a set of 400 tokens, including the initial 100. As a result of this process of automatic tagging of structural elements we produced a TEI/SGML tagged corpus with yet no corresponding overt DTD. In Section 2 we will explain how DTDs were later induced from the tagged corpus.","Once the corpus was segmented the next step was to align it. This was conducted at different levels: general document elements (DIV, SEG, P), as well as sentential and intra-sentential elements, such as S, ItS, NUM, DATE, etc. (Martinez, 1998b). Aligned in this way, the corpus becomes an important resource for translation. Four complementary language databases may be obtained at any time from the annotated corpus: three translation memory databases (TM1, TM2, and TM3) as well as a terminology database (termbase). The three TMs differ in the nature of the translation units they contain. TM1 consists of aligned sentences than can feed commercial TM software. TM2 contains elements which are translation segments ranging from whole sections of a document or multisentence paragraphs to smaller units, such as short phrases or proper names. TM3 simply hosts the whole collection of aligned bilingual","Types of documents in the corpus beyond our interest (Trados Translator's Work- ..... . bench, Star!s Transit,.,SDLX, D e'j£~fi,.

The originality of our editing tool lies in a design which benefits from joining the potentiality of DTDs and the elements in TM2, as will be shown in sections 4 and 5. 2 DTD abstraction SGML mark-up determines the logical structure of a document and its syntax in the form of a context-free grammar. This is called the Document Type Definition (DTD) and it contains specifications for:","® Names and content for all elements that are permitted to appear in a document.","o Order in which these elements must appear.","o Tag attributes with default values for those elements. DTDs have been abstracted away from the an-notations that were automatically introduced in the corpus. Similar experiments have been reported before in the literature. (Ahonen, 1995) uses a method to build document instances from tagged texts that consists of a de-terministic finite automaton for each context model. Subsequently, these automata are generalized and converted into regular expressions which are easily transcribed into SGML content models. (Shafer, 1995) combines docmnent instances with simplification rules. Our method is similar to Sharer's, but .with a.modification in the way rules reduce document instances. A tool to obtain a DTD for all document instances has been developed (Casillas, 1999). Given that source and target documents show some syntactic and structural mismatches, two different DTDs are induced, one for each language, and 33 Spanish Text: <div0> <divl> ... </divl> <seg9 id=9ES2 corresp=gEU2> Contra dicha <rs type=law id=LES12 corresp=LEU10> Orden Foral </rs>, que agota la vfa administrativa podr~i interponerse recurso contencioso-administrativo ante la <rs type=organization id=0ES9 corresp=0EUl i> Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tri- • bunal Superior de J usticia del Pais Vasco </rs >, en el plazo de dos meses, contado desde el d/a Basque Text: <div0> <divl> ... </divl> <seg9 i de9EU2 correspe9ES2> <rs type=law id=LEUi0 corresp=LESl2> Foru agindu </rs> horrek amaiera eman dio administrazio bideari; eta beraren aurka <rs type=organization id=0EU10> Administrazioarekiko </rs> auzibide-errekurtsoa jarri ahal izango zaio <rs type=organization id=0EUll corresp=0ES9> Euskal Herriko JustiziAuzitegi Nagusiko Administrazioarekiko Auzibideetarako Salari </rs>,","siguiente a"]},{"title":"esta~:m~t.~eaci~m~.sin~p~er~ui~i~deAu~,.~;.~aila~aetek~:~epea~;~4ja~d~mxazpen","paragraphs":["~hatl egiten","utilizacidn de otros medios de defensa que estime den egunaren biharamunetik zenbatuko da epe","oportunos. </seg9> hori; halo eta guztiz ere, egokiesten diren beste","defentsabideak ere erabil litezke. </seg9> <segl0 id=10ES1 corresp=10EUl> Durante el referido plazo el expediente BHI-<num num=10094> 100/94 </num>-P05-A quedar£ de manifiesto para su ex~imen en las dependencias de <rs type=place id=PES3 corresp=PEU2> Bilbao calle Alameda Rekalde </rs>, <num num=30> 30 </num>, <num num=5> 5.a </num> y <hum hum=6> 6.a </hUm> plantas. </segl0> </div0> <closer id=pESl3 corresp=pEUl3 > <name> El Diputado Foral de Urbanismo Pedro Hern£ndez Gonz~ilez. </name> </closer> <segl0 id=10EU1 corresp=10ESl> Epe hori amaitu arte BHI-<num num=10094> 100/94 </num>-P05-A espedientea agerian egongo da, nahi duenak azter dezan, <rs type=place id=PEU2 corresp=PES3> Bilboko Errekalde zumarkaleko </rs> <num num=30> 30.eko </num> bulegoetan, <num num=5> 5 </num> eta <num num=6> 6.</num> solairuetan. </segl0> </div0> <closer id=pEU13 corresp=pESl3> <name> Hirigintzako foru diputatua.

At present, we have six DTDs, one for each document type in each language (there are three document types; Figure 2 shows a part of one of these DTDs). By means of these paired DTDs, document elements in each language are appropriately placed. In the process of generating the bilingual document, a document type must first be selected. Each document type has an associated DTD. This DTD specifies which elements are obhgatory and.which are optional. With the aid of the DTD, the source document is generated. The target document will be generated with .the aid of the com~esponding target DTD. 3 Joining TM2 and DTD TM2 specifically stores a type of translation segment class, which we have tagged <segl>,"]},{"title":"<seg2>... <segn>,","paragraphs":["<title> and <rs>, and which is relevant to the DTD.

Segments tagged <rs> are referring expressions which have been recognized, tagged and aligned • and which correspond largely to proper names (Martinez, 1998a), (Martinez, 1998b). TM2 is managed in tile form of a relational database -where segments are stored, as records. .Each record in the database consists of four fields: the segment string, a counter for the occurrences of that string in the corpus, the tag and the attributes (type, id and corresp). Table 2 shows how the text fragment inside 34 <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT LEGE - - (TEXT)> TEXT - - (BODY)> BODY - - (OPENER, DIVO, CLOSER)> 0PENER - - (TITLE, NUM, DATE, NAME?, SEGI)> SEGI - - (SEGIi, (#PCDATAIRSIDATEINUM)+)> (SEGii, NUM, DATE, RS, NAME, TITLE) (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT [SEGI5)+, <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT <!ELEMENT (DIVO) - - ( (#PCDATA [RS INUM [DATE ISEG4[SEGS ISEG6[SEG7 ISEG8 ISEGI2 [SEGi4 SEG9?, SEGIO?)> (SEG4, SEG5, SEG6) (#PCDATA) > (SEG9, SEGiO, SEGT, SEG8, SEGi2, SEGi4, SEGi5) - - (#PCDATA[RS[DATE[NUM)+> (CLOSER) ii(PLACENAME?,DATE?, NAME?)> (PLACENAME) - : (RS)> <!ATTLIST RS TYPE (0RGANIZATION[ LAW[ PLACE[ UNCAT) UNCAT> Figure 2: Part of the DTD of the type document Orden Foral the </divl>...</div0> tags of Figure 1 renders three records in the database. Note how the content of the string field in the database maintains only the initial <segn> and <rs> tags. Furthermore, <rs> tagged segments inside <segn> records are simplified so that their content is dismissed and only the initial tag is kept (Lange et al., 1997). The reason is that they are considered variable elements within the segment (dates and numbers are also these type of elements). The strings Orden Foral of record 2 marked as <rs type=law> and Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Pais Vasco of record 3 <rs type=organization> are thus not in-cluded in record 1 <segg>, since they may differ in other instantiations of the segment. These internal elements are largely proper names that vary from one instantiation of the segment to another. The <rs> tag can be considered to be the name of the varying element. The value of the type attribute <rs type=law> constraints the kind of referential expression that may be inserted in that point of the translation segment. Table 2 shows that source and target records may not have straight one-to-one correspondences. Although this is by no means the general:case; only about 5.61%, (Martinez, 1998a), such one-to-N correspondences provide good ground to explain how the TM2 is designed. The asymmetry can be easily explained. The Spanish term recurso contencioso-administrativo has been translated into Basque by means of a category changing operation, where the Spanish adjective administrativo has been translated as a Basque noun complement Administrazioarekiko which literally means \"Administration-the-with-of' triggering its identification as a proper noun.","Table 3 shows the way in which source language units are related with their corresponding target units, which, as can be observed, can be one-to-one or one-to-N. This means that one source element can have more than one translation.","TM2 is created in three steps:","® First, non-pertinent tags are filtered out from the annotated corpus. Tags marking sentence <s> and paragraph <p> align-ment are removed because they are of no interest for TM2 'recall that they are registered in TM1).","• Second, translation segments <segn>, <title> phrases and referential expressions <rs> are detected in the source document and looked up in the database.","o Third, if they are not already present in the database, they are stored each in its database.and values of the id and corresp attributes-are~used to set the correspondence between source and target database. 4 Composition Strategy Every phase in tile process is guided by the markup contained in TM2 and the paired DTDs 35 Spanish Unit <seg9> Contra dicha <rs type=law>, que agota la via administrativa podr~i interponerse recurso contencioso-administrativo ante la <rs type=organization>, en el plazo de dos meses, contado desde el dla siguiente a esta notificacidn, sin perjuicio de la utilizaci6n","Basque Unit <seg9> <rs type=law> horrek amaiera eman dio","• - adrrrinistrazio'bideari; eta:beraren aurka: \" <rs type=organization> auzibide-errekurtsoa jarri","ahal izango zaio <rs type=organization>,","bi hilabeteko epean;","jakinarazpen hau egiten den egunaren","de otros medios de. defensa que estime oportunos, biharamunetik zenbatuko da epe hori;","que estime oportunos, hala eta guztiz ere, egokiesten diren beste","............

The composition process follows two main steps which correspond to the traditional source document generation and translation into the target document. The markup and the paired DTD guides the process in the following manner:","1. Before the user starts writing the source document, he must select a document type, i.e., a DTD. This has two consequences. On the one hand, the selected DTD produces a source document template that contains the logical structure of the document and some of its contents. On the other hand, the selected source DTD trigger:s .a target paired DTD, which will be used later to translate the document. There are three different types of elements in the source document template: ® Some elements are mandatory and are",".: A . . provided to the user, who must only choose its content among some alternative usages (s/he will get a list of alternatives ordered by frequency, for example <title>). Other obligatory elements, such as dates and numbers, will also be automatically generated.","o Some other elements in the template are optional (e.g., <seg9>). Again, a list of alternatives will be offered to the user.

It is the most variable part, and .the system lets the writer input text freely. It is when TM2 has nothing to offer that TM1 and TM3 may provide useful material. Given the recurrent style of legal documentation, it is quite likely that the user will be using many of the bilingual text choices already aligned and available in TM1 and TM3.","2. Once the source document has been completed, the system derives its particular logical structure, which, with the aid of the target DTD, is projected into the resulting target logical structure. 5 Evaluation Table 4 shows the number of words that make up the segments stored in TM2 from the source documents. There is a line for each document size considered. We can see that the average of segments contained in TM2 is 31.8%, on a scale from 34.91% to only 3.01%. The amount of segments dealt with in this way largely de-pends on the size of the document. Short documents (90.21) have about 35% of their text composed in this way. This figure goes down to 3% in documents larger than 1,000 words. This is understandable, in the sense that the larger the document, the smaller proportion of fixed sections it will contain.","Table 5. shows the Immber of words that are proposed for the target document. These translations are obtained from what is stored in TM2 complemented by algorithms designed to translate dates and numbers. We can see that the average of document translated is 34%.

On average, one third of the contents of thedocuments can be automatically accounted for. It must also be pointed out that the part being dealt with represents the core structure, lay-out and logical components of the text. The remaining two-thirds of untreated document can still be managed with the aid of sentence-oriented TMBS, filling in the gaps in the ore/all skeleton provided by the target template. Composers may also browse TM3 to retrieve whole blocks for those parts which are not determined by the DTD. One of the clear targets for the future is to extend the coverage of the corpus and to test structural taggers against other document types. A big challenge we face is to develop tools that automatically perform the recognition of documents from less restricted and more open text types. However, we are not sure of the extent of the practicality of such an approach. An alternative direction we are presently considering is to establish a collection of pre-defined document types, which would be validated by the institutional writers themselves. It is a process currently being implemented in the Basque administration to de-fine docmnent models for writers and translators to follow. What we have demonstrated is that paired DTDs, complemented with rich language resources of the kind defined in this paper, allow for the design of optimal editing environments which would combine both document composition and translation as one single process. All the resourcesneeded (DTDs.and TMs) . can be induced from an aligned corpus. 7 Acknowledgements This research is being partially supported by the Spanish Research Agency, project ITEM, TIC-96-1243-C03-01."]},{"title":"References H.
