When other learning techniques (symbolic or statistical) are widely used in Natural Language Learning, few applications use theory refinement (Abecker and Schmid, 1996), (Mooney, 1993). We would like to show that even a basic implementation of notions used in TR is enough to build an efficient machine learning system concerning the task of learning linguistic structures.","ALLiS relies on the use of background knowledge and default values in order to build up an initial grammar and on the use of theory refinement in order to improve this grammar. This combination provides a good machine learning framework (efficient and fast) for Natural Language Learning. After presenting theory refinement (Section 2) and a general description of ALLiS (Section 3), we will show how each step of TR is applying in the specific case of learning linguistic structures (non-recursive phrases). 2 About Theory Refinement Theory refinement (hereafter TR) consists of improving an existing knowledge base so that it fits more with data. No work using theory refinement applied to the grammar learning paradigm seems to have been developed. We would like to point out in this article the adequacy between theory refinement and Natural Language Learning. For a more detailed presentation of TR, we refer the reader to (Abecker and Schmid, 1996), (Brunk, 1996). (Mooney, 1993) defines it as: Theory refinement systems developed in Machine Learning automatically modify a Knowledge Base to render it consistent with a set of classified training examples. This technique thus consists of improving a given Knowledge Base (here a grammar) on the basis of examples (here a treebank). Some methods try to modify the initial knowledge base as little as possible. (Abecker and Schmid, 1996) presents the general algorithm as: 1.

These categorisation rules allow (partial) parsing. Unless (Brill, 1993), these rules can-not be directly used in order to parse a text. ALLiS uses an internal formalism in order to represent the grammar rules it has learned. This internal representation (Table 1) allows 95 the use of different systems in order to parse the structures. Each system requires a conversion of theses rules into its formalism. This use of \"intermediary\" formalism allows the separation of two different problems: the genera-tion of (linguistic) rules and the use of them. Unless Transformation-Based Learning (Brill, 1993) which modifies training data each time a rule is learned, ALLiS always uses the original training data. By this way you try to separate the problem of learning \"linguistic\" rules to the problem of parsing (the adequate use of these rules). The rules generated contains enough information (elements which compose the contexts, structures of these elements) so that we can correctly generate rules for a specific parser. We can note that, although rules have to be or-dered during the parse, this order does not depend on the order used during the learning step, but depends on the category of the element.","Context in(l) or out(2) Tag Left Right W L R VBG PRP$ 1 1 VBG POS 1 1 VBG JJ 1 1 VBG DT 1 1 VBG TO 1 2 VBG IN 1 2 VBG VBG 1 2 Table 1: Contexts generated for the categorisation of the category AL (NP).","Table 1 shows a part of the file generated concerning the categorisation of the tag VBG. The first line has to be read: when the tag VBG occurs after the tag PRP$ (left context) and when the tag PRP$ occurs in the structure (L=l(in)), the tag VBG is categorised as AL (left adjunct: see next section). In order to parse a text, a module automatically converts this formalism into appropriate formalisms which can be used by existing symbolic parsers. Several tools have been tried: the CASS parser (Abney, 1996), XFST (Karttunen et al., 1997)) and LT TTT (Glover et al., 1999). The TTT formalism seems to be the most appropriate (rules are easy to generate and the resulting parser is fast). The TTT rule corresponding to the first line of the table 1 is given table 2 <RULE name=\"AL\" targ_sg=\"© [CAT=' AL' ] \"> <REL match=\"W [C= ' PRP$ '","m_mod= ' TEST '"]},{"title":"S='NP']","paragraphs":["\"> </REL> <REL match=\"W[C='VBG'] \"> </REL>"]},{"title":"</RULE>","paragraphs":["Table 2: TTT formalism.","4 The Generation of the Initial Grammar The first step is to assign to each tag of the corpus a default category corresponding to its most frequent behaviour regarding the structure we want to learn. The result of its operation is a set of rules which assign a default category to each tag.","In general, the baseline is computed by giving an element its most frequent tag. ALLiS uses an initial grammar which is a little more so-phisticated: it uses the same principle with the exception that the default tag depends on contexts. Generally the chunk tagset is composed of three tags: B,I, and O. ALLiS uses a subcategorisation of the I category. It considers that a structure is composed of a Nucleus (tag N) with optional left and right adjuncts (AL and AR). These three classes (AL, N, AR) possess an attribute B 1 with the value +/-. Further-more, an element is considered as AL/AR iff it occurs before/after a nucleus. For this reason, a tag such as j j2 can be categorised as AL or O(outside) according to its context. Precision and recall of this initial grammar axe around 86%. An example of NP analyse provided by the initial grammar is:"]},{"title":"(i) [ It_PRP_N ] 's_VBZ_O [ traders_NNS_O ] squaring_VBG_O [ positions_NNS_N ] .

The general theory refinement algorithm given by (Abecker and Schmid, 1996) is: - Find revision points in theory - Create possible revisions - Choose best revision - Revise theory until no revision improves theory","The next sections now show how these operations are performed by ALLiS. 5.1 Revision Points Revision points correspond to errors generated by the initial grammar.

Some words in some contexts can have a behaviour which can not be detected at the tag level. If contextualisation is rather corpus in-dependent, lexicalisation generates rules which depend of the type of the training corpus. More details about these two operations can be found in (D@jean, 2000b). 5.3 The Generalisation After specialisation, some structures are still not recognised. If some revisions points can not be fixed using only local contexts, a generalisation (by relaxing constraints) in the definition of the structure can improve parsing. A structure is composed of a nucleus and optional adjuncts (Section 3). Such a structure can not recognise all the sequences categorised as NP in the training corpus.

In fact the number of rules can be reduced during the specialisation step. But a simplest way is to select some rules after specialisation and generalisation according to heuristics.","The heuristic we used consists first of select-ing the most frequent rules and then among them, those having the richest (longest) context (several rules can be obtained using only the criterion of frequency). In our case (learning linguistic structures), this heuristic provides good result, but a more efficient algorithm might may consist of parsing the corpus with the candidate rules and to select the most frequent rules providing the best parse.","We can note that these superfluous rules do not generally produce wrong analyses, even if some are not linguistically motivated. The fact that we try to get the minimal revised theory is computationally interesting since the reduction of rules eases parsing. 6 Results ALLiS was used in order to learn several structures (D6jean, 2000b). The table 5 shows results for VP and NP and results obtained by other systems 4. The best result is obtained by (Tjong Kim Sang, 2000) using a combination of NP representation. ALLiS offers the best score for the symbolic systems. 7 Conclusion We showed that even a simple implementation of TR provides good results (comparable to other systems) for learning non-recursive structures from bracketed corpora. The next steps","4More complete results are shown in (D6jean, 2000a) and (D6jean, 2000b). concern two directions. First the improvement of algorithms used by ALLiS (especially the selection of rules). The second step consists of applying ALLiS on other structures, especially the clause so that ALLiS can provide a more complete parsing.","References","Andreas Abecker and Klaus Schmid. 1996.
