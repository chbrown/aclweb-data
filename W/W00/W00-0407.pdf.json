The goal of summarization for such \"indicative\" use is to serve fast and accurate judgement. We have developed the concept of the \"at-a-glance\" summary, and its realization in the Japanese language - \"phrase-representation summarizatiola\" - to achieve this goal (Ueda, et al. 2000). We have conducted an evaluation experiment to verify the effectiveness of this summarization method.","There are two strategies for evaluating summarization systems: intrinsic and extrinsic (Jing, et al. 1998). Intrinsic methods measure a system's quality mainly by comparing the system's output with an \"ideal\" summary. Extrinsic methods measure a system's performance in a particular task. The aim of the phrase-representation summarization method is fast and accurate judgement in selecting documents in information retrieval. Thus, we adopted a task-based method to evaluate whether the goal was achieved. Task-based evaluation has recently drawn the attention in thq summarization field, because the assumption that there is only one \"ideal\" summary is considered to be incorrect, and some experiments on information retrieval were reported (Jing, et al. 1998) (Mani, et al. 1998) (Mochizuki and Okunura 1999). However, there is no standard evaluation method, and we consider that there are some shortcomings in the existing methods. Thus, we have developed an improved evaluation method and carried out a relatively large experiment.","In this paper, we first give an overview of the phrase-representation summarization method. We then consider the evaluation method and show the result of an experiment based on the improved method to demonstrate the effectiveness of phrase-representation summarization."]},{"title":"1 Phrase-Representation Summarization","paragraphs":["Most automatic summarization systems adopt the \"sentence extraction\" method, which gives a score to every sentence based on such characteristics as the frequency of a word or the position where it appears, and selects sentences with high scores. In such a way, long and complex sentences tend to be extracted. However, a long and complex sentence is difficult to read and understand, and therefore it is not a suitable unit to compose a summary for use in selecting documents.","To avoid the burden of reading such long and complex sentences, we have developed the phrase-representation summarization method, which represents the outline of a document by a series of short and simple expressions (\"phrases\") that contain key concepts.

The previous experiments gave only a short description of a topic.

Peninsula\") and assumed three questions. To indicate to the subjects, we set detailed situation including the motivation to know about that or the use of the information obtained for each question. This method satisfies the restriction \"to limit the variation in assessment between readers\" in the MLUCE Protocol (Minel, et ai. 1997)."]},{"title":"61","paragraphs":["For each topic, ten documents are selected from search results by major WWW search engines, so that more than five relevant documents are included for each question.

He said that one of his Chinese friends had given them to him. They rooked so new to us that we shared and ate them at a coffee break. Chinese eat moon cakes at the mid-autumn festival while Japanese have dumplings then. Someone asked a question why Chinese ate moon cakes, to-which nobody gave the answer. Some cakes tasted sweet as we expected; some were stuffed with salty fillings like roasted pork. Ms. B said that there were over fifty kinds of filling.

The only requirement for subjects is that they should be familiar with WWW search process."]},{"title":"3.3 Relevance Levels","paragraphs":["In the previous experiments, a subject reads a summary and judges whether it is relevant or irrelevant.

We will not examine dubious","documents if sufficient information is obtained","or we do not have sufficient time, and we will","examine dubious documents when an exhaustive","survey is required.

If these are applied to the case of the fare of","the Malay Railway, the criteria will be","interpreted as follows. L3:An expression like \"the berth charge of the second class is about RMI5\" is in a summary. L2: An expression like \"I looked into the fare of the train\" is in a summary.

There are two drawbacks to these measurements: (1) the variance of the subjects' assessment makes the measure inaccurate, and (2) performance of each summary sample is not measured.","Precision and recall are widely used to measure information retrieval performance.

The variance reduces the significance of the average precision and recall value. Because we introduced four relevance levels and showed the assessment criteria to the subjects, we can assume three kinds of relevance document sets: L3 only, L3 + L2, and L3 + L2 + L1. The set composed only of the documents with L3 assessment should have a high precision score. This case represents a user wants to know only high-probability information, for example, the user is hurried, or just one answer is sufficient. The set including L1 documents should get a high recall score. This case represents a user wants to know any information concerned with a specific question.","Precision and recall represent the performance of a summarization method for certain question, however they do not indicate the reason why the method presents higher or lower performance. To find the reasons and improve a summarization method based on them, it is useful to analyze quality and performance connected together for each summary sample. Measuring each summary's performance is necessary for such analysis. Therefore, we introduce the relevance score, which represents the correspondence between the subject judgement and the correct document relevance. The score of each pair of subject judgement and document relevance is shown in Table 3.","By averaging scores of all subjects for every sample, summary's performances are compared.

We then discuss advantages of our experimental method in Section 5.3, and language dependency of the experiment result in Section 5.4. 65 5.1 Comparison of Constituent Unit The units that constitute a summary may affect the judging process; if the unit is long, the number of units appeared in a summary may decrease and the summary contains fewer key concepts in the original document. We counted the number of the summaries that contain the clues to the given questions (see Table 4). The average numbers are 0.3, 2.0, 4.3 and 4.7 for (A) fixed-length characters, (B) sentences, (C) phrases and (D) words, respectively. The phrase-represented summary (C) and the keyword enumeration summary (D) widely cover the topics, and they are about twice as wide as the sentence extraction summary (B). The leading fixed-length characters (A) contain very few clues and this fact supports that this summary presents the worst performance (see Section 4.1).","In order to compare a summary's performance with a summary's quality, we calculate the average relevance score of summaries that contain clues. These scores are also shown in Table 4. The average score represents the informativeness of each summary. Table 4 shows that the sentence extraction summary (B) and the phrase-represented summary (C) get , relatively high scores, but vary with the question. This is because sentences and phrases are sufficiently informative in most cases, but sentences tend to contain unnecessary information, and phrases tend to lack necessary information. The keyword enumeration summary (D) gets a relatively low score. This is because a word is not sufficiently informative to enable judgement of whether it is clue to the answer, and relations among words are lacked.","These analyses support the two characteristics of the phrase-represented summaries described in Chapter 1, that is, adequate informativeness and wide coverage of topics. 5.2 Influence of Question and Document The most suitable summarization method may depend on the type of question and/or document. In the experiment results (see Section 4.1.2), the sentence extraction summary (B) and the phrase-represented summary (C) get the highest relevance score. Therefore, here we focus on those two summarization methods and consider the influence of questions and documents.","In selecting questions, we consider two factors may affect performance. One is which unit an answer is expressed in. Another is whether clue words easily come to mind.","If an answer is expressed as a relation of a predicate to its arguments, the phrase-representation summarization may be suitable. Question-a2 and Question-b are of this case. If an answer is expressed as compound relations, e.g., reason-consequence relations or cause-result relations, the sentence extraction summarization may be required. And, if an answer is expressed in complex relations of sentences, any summarization method of the four is not suitable. Questions that ask historical background or complicated procedures are examples of this kind, e.g., Question-al.","As for another factor, if clue words easily come to mind, the phrase-represented summary is suitable for any unit in which an answer is expressed. This is because the clues are found more easily in short phrases than in long sentences.","In selecting documents, whether a question is relevant to the main topic of a document affects the performance, because we use generic summaries. By sentence extraction summarization, the answer is extracted as a summary only when the question is relevant to the main topic. Phrase-represented summary is able to cover topics more widely, for example, one of the main topics or detailed description of each topic (see Section 5.1). Because the characteristic of the document is independent of the question, which summaries cannot be predicted, and thus the phrase-represented summary will give better results.","Through these discussions, we conclude that the phrase-representation summarization is suitable for various cases, while the sentence extraction summarization is for only some restricted cases. Though the samples of questions and documents are relatively few in our experiment, it is sufficient to show the effectiveness of the phrase-representation summarization. 66","5.3 Advantages of our Experimental Method Our experimental method has the following advantages. (1) More exact assessment (2)Serves precision/recall pairs for a variety of","situations (3)Helps further analysis of problems of a","summarization method 5.3.1 More Exact Assessment Our experimental method provides more exact relevance assessment in the following ways. (a) More detailed description of a question We asked the subjects to assess the relevance of full documents to each question after the experiment. Result shows that 93% of the subject judgements match the assumed relevance, while only 69% match in the same kind of assessment in SUMMAC. The percentage that all judgements per document agreed the assumed relevance is 33%, while only 17% in SUMMAC. This is because the subjects comprehended the questions correctly by given detailed information about the situation. (b) More subjects assigned per summary sample We assigned ten subjects to each summary sample, while only one or two subjects were used in SUMMAC. We examined the difference of judgement between the average of ten subjects and the first subject of the ten. Result \"shows that 47% of the first subject's judgement differ more than one level from the average. This proves that the assessment varies from one subject to another, even if a detailed situation is given. (c) Finer levels of relevance We introduced four levels of relevance, by which ambiguity of relevance can be expressed better. 5.3.2 Serves precision~recall pairs for a varie(F","of situations According to the four levels of relevance, we assume three kinds of relevance document sets. This enables to plot the PR curve.","In evaluation conferences like SUMMAC, various summarization methods that are developed for different purposes must be compared. Using such a PR curve, each method can be compared in a criterion that matches its purpose. 5.3.3 Helps further analysis of problems of a","summarization method We have introduced the relevance score, which allows each summary to be evaluated. Using this score, we can analyze the extrinsic evaluation result and the intrinsic evaluation result connected together, for example, an evaluation result based on information retrieval task and that based on Q & A task using the same questions. Through such analyses, the text quality of summaries or the adequate informativeness can be examined. We ourselves got a lot of benefit from the analysis to find problems and improve the quality of the summary. 5.4 Language dependency Though experiment method may be applied to any other languages, we must consider the possibility that our result depends on the language characteristics. Japanese text is written by mixing several kinds of characters; Kana characters (Hiragana and Katakana) and Kanji (Chinese) characters, and alphabetic characters are also used. Kanji characters are mainly used to represent concept words and Hiragana characters are used for function words. The fact that they play the different roles makes it easy to find the full words. Also Kanji is a kind of ideogram and each character has its own meaning. Thus, most words can be expressed by 1 to 3 Kanji characters to make short phrases (15 - 20 characters) sufficiently informative.","Though the basic algorithm to create phrase-represented summary itself can be applied to other languages by replacing its analysis component and generation component, similar experiment in that language is required to prove the effectiveness of the phrase-represented summary. Conclusion We proposed an improved method of task-based evaluation on information retrieval. This method can be used to evaluate the performance of summarization methods more accurately than is possible by the methods used in previous work. We carried out a relatively large experiment using this method, the results of which show that 67 phrase-representation summarization is effective to select relevant documents from information retrieval results.
