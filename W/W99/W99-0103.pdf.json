They often refer to the items signified by a gesture or by visual means. In this paper, we define two kinds of anaphora: screen anaphora and referring anaphora, and propose two general methods to resolve these anaphora. One is a simple mapping algorithm that can find items refetxed with/without pointing gestures on a screen. The other is the centering algorithm with a dual cache model, which Walker's centering algorithm is extended to for a multi-modal dialogue system. The extended algorithm is appropriate to resolve various anaphora in a multi-modal dialogue .because it keeps utterances, visual information and screen switching- ,.tim.e. In the experiments, the system. Correctly resolved 384 anaphora out of 402 anaphom in 40 dialogues (0..54 anaphom per utterance) showing 95.5% correctness. Introduction Human face<o-face communication is an ideal model for humm-computa- interface. One of the major features of face-to-face communication is its multiplicity of communication channels that acts on multiple modalities. By providing a number of channels through which information may pass between a user and a computer, a multi-modal dialogue system gives the user a • more convenient and natural interface than a language-only dialogue system. In the system, a user often uses a variety of anaphodc expressions like this, the red item, it, etc. User's intention is passed to the system through multiple channels, e.g., the auditory channel (carrying speech) and the visual channel (c~nrying gestures and/or facial expressions). For example, a user can say utterance (4) in Figure ! ! while touching an item on the screen. The user may also say utterance (8) without touching the screen when there is only one red item displayed on the screen. Moreover, the user can use anaphoric expression to refer to an entity in previous utterances as in utterance (10). (1) S: May I help you7 (2) U: I want to see some desks.

Figure 1: Motivational example I","Previous rescaw, h on a multi-modal dialogue system was focused on finding the relationship between a pointing gesture and a deictic expression (Bolt (1980), Neal et al. (1988), Salisbury et al. (1990.), Shimazu et al. (1994), Shimazu and Takmhima (1996))and on mapping a predefined symbol to a simple t S means a multi-modal dialogue system and U means a user. Our goal is developing a multi-modal dialogue system (Kim and Son (1997)). of which domain is home shopping and in which a user purchases furniture using Korean utC~',mccs with pointing gestures on a touch screw. 21 command (Johnston et al. (1997)). None of them, however, suggest methods of resolving deictic expressions with which pointing gestures are omitted: e.g.. the red item in utterance (8). These approaches do not consider resolving an anaphoric expression that refers an object mentioned in previous utterances or displayed on previous screens. It, however, is important also for a multi-modal dialogue system to resolve all of these anaphora so that the system should correctly catch his/her intention. In this paper, we propose general methods to resolve a variety of anaphoric expressions that are found in a multi-modal dialogue. We classify anaphora into two types: deictic expression with/without a pointing gesture and referring expression, and propose methods to resolve them.","To resolve deictic expression like this in utterance (4) which c~rs with a pointing gesture and the red item in utterance (8) which is uttered with no pointing gestures, the system counts the \"number of pointing gestures and the number of anaphoric noun phrases included in a user's utterance, and compares them. Then, the system maps the noun phrases to pointed items.","To resolve referring expression, one of the","well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Jo~hi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al. (1983)). The centering algorithm was further developed by Brennan, Friedman and Pollard for pronoun resolution (Brennan et al. (1987)) and was improved by Walker (Walker (1998)). However,' those centering algorithms are not applicable to resolve anaphora in a multi-medal dialogue because the algurithm excludes the gestures and facial","• expression of a dialogue partner, which are important clues to mgierstand his/her uttexances."]},{"title":"And. the algorithm cannot","paragraphs":["resolve complex"]},{"title":"anaphora like the previous selection","paragraphs":["in (10)beeanse it does not keep the time When the previous screen is switched to the current screen. To resolve inch anaphom, we extend Walker's centedng algorithm to the one with a dual cache model, which keeps the information displayed on a ~ With screen switching-time.","The rest of this paper begins with describing our approach in section !. After showing two methods to resolve anaphora in a rrmlti-modal dialogue system in section 2, we report experimental results on these methods in section 3. Finally. we draw some conclusions. 22 1 Our approach In this paper, we define two types of anaphora: screen anaphora and referring anaphora. Screen anaphora is an anaphoric noun phrase that refers to an entity on the present screen by a pointing gesture or through a visual channel. For example, th/s in uuerance (4) in Figure ! is the screen anaphora referred by a pointing gesture, and the red item in utterance (8) is the one referred through a visual channel. Referring anaphora is an anaphoric noun phrase that refers to an entity in previous utterances or on pre~,ions screens, For example, we call it in utterance (9) referring anaphora because the referred entity is the red item in the previous utterance (8). We also call the previous selection in utterance (10) referring anaphora because the refe~nt is the model 200 shown on the previous screen.","The screen anaphora resolution algorithm counts the number of pointing gestures and the number of anaphoric noun phrases included in the user's utterance and compares them. If the numbers are equal, the system maps the gestures to the phrases. Otherwise. the system uses some heuristics to map the gestures according to the priority of the phrases.","The referring anaphora resolution algorithm is based on the Walker's centering algorithm with a cache model. Centering is formulated as a theory that relates focus of attention, choice of referring expressions and perceived coherence of utterances; within a discourse segment. The centering algorithm (Ccnsz et al. (1983), Brennan et al. (1987), Walker et aL (1990)) consists of three main structures. Forward-looking Centers are entities which form a set of entities associated with each. utterance. Forward-looking Centers are ranked according to their relative salience. The highest ranged entity is called the Preferred Center. Backward-looking Center is a special member of this set. It is the highest ranked member of Forward-looking Centers of the previous utterance, which is also realized in the current utterance. The algorithm defines a set of constraints, rules, and transition states between a pair of utterances by the use of these structures. It incorlgntes these rules and the other linguistic constraints to resolve anaphoric expressions. In the past, it was integrated with a stack model because most researchers believed that the centers should exist within a discourse segment (Grosz and Sidner"]},{"title":"0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 O O","paragraphs":["(9} NtS 80.000 WOn. - {8} HOw much nt ff~' *~ steoO (~') We have s.,~se moOel$ citer*, ttm","feuee¢ ..> S'wffchit~l-fime","Cache Memory Figure 2: Walker's cache model • ~ m~ra~ sk~ ~maml slol lwmbll~ m~ m~t r,e~ m m~ JG~m~ Id~ ~a~ ~iw um~q W mb t~.~ ~./lehlno-lim~ Iffo.fg ft~ ~k~| {2} ~111, e so me ~ml O) Mwem,~u? Dual Cache Figure 3: Dual cache model Oual Memory (1986), Brennan et al. (1987), Walker (1989)). Walker replaced the stack model with a cache model because some objects were often referred in other discourse segments (Walker (1998)). The fundamental idea of the cache model is that the function of the cache when processing discourse is analogous to that of a cache when executing a program on a computer. In the cache model, the centers of an utterance are stored in the cache fill the cache is full. When it is full, the least ~ently accessed centet~ in the cache are replaced to main memory. Figure 2 shows a state of the cache and memory when we apply the cache model to Figure 1. In Figure 2, we have replaced the centers by the user's utterances for simpfifying the illustration, In Figme 2 and 3, the utterance with the highly ranked entities placed above the utterance with low ranked entities.","To resolve the amphora h'ke the"]},{"title":"previous","paragraphs":["selection Shown in utterance"]},{"title":"(I0) in Figure I, the system","paragraphs":["should refer to previous utterances.

To refer previous utterances and screens, the extended model keeps the centers of user's utterances, visual information, and screen switching-time, The visual information means the characteristics of the items on a screen, e.g.. model number, color, size, shape and so on. The screen switching-time means the time when the system changes the previous screen to the current screen to show new items. Figure 3 shows a state of the dual cache and memory when we apply the new model to Figure 1. To decide the priority of the utterances, we present a priority rule; the more kinds of information an utterance carries, the higher priority the utterance has. One of the heuristic roles is that utterances occurring with pointing gestures have the higher possibility to be focused in a future dialogue than those without pointing gestures. If uttemnc~ carry the same kinds of information, the recent utterance have higher priority than the earlier utterance in the stack model. For example, utterance (8) in Figure ! were spoken earlier than utterance (9). It has, however, higher rank than utterance (9) as shown in Figure 3 because it occurred with visual information. Utterance (7) haS higher rank 23 than utterance (8) because it occurred With gesture information such as the user's pointing gesture or the system's blinking gesture for the highlighted items as well as visual information. Now, if the dual cache model is applied to the system to find the referred entity of the previous selection shown in utterance (10) in Figure l. the system can get the correct referent, model 200 in utterance (4), because the model recognizes the time base of previous and searches centers in the utterance slot associated with the previous visual slot which includes model 200 and model 250 as shown in Figure 3. 2 Anaphora resolution algorithms 2.1 The screen anaphora resolution algorithm The screen anaphora resolution algorithm replaces screen anaphora in an utterance with the items referred with/without pointing gestures. For example, if a user says \"I'd like to buy this and the red cha/r.\" when pointingto an item on the screen, this in the utterance means the item that he/she points to and the red chair means the chair on the screen that is red. According to the number of anaphora and the number of gestures co-occun-ed with an utterance, we divide the algorithm into three cases. Case 1: The number of gestures and the number of anaphora are equal. Case 1 occurs most frequently in a multi-modal dialogue. In this case, the algorithm replaces the • anaphora with the pointed items according.to the order of occunence. For example; \"th/s in the utterance (4) in Figure I can bz resolved by this"]},{"title":"simple mapping. Case 2: The number of gestures is less than","paragraphs":["the number of anaphora. Case 2. occurs when a user omits a pointing gesture because heJshe can uniquely select an item on the screen with the anaphoric expression or when the~ are referring anaphom as well as screen amphora as in utterance (I0) in Figure I. In the former case, the algorithm can easily resolve the anaphora because it can uniquely decide the referred entity on the screen by visual information of the item. However, the algorithm cam~ot resolve the referring anaphora in this step because it needs to look at the previous utterances. The algorithm passes them to the referring anaphor a resolution algorithm. We will show the referring anaphora resolution algorithm in section 3.2. . Case 3: The number of gestures is greater than the number of anaphora. Case 3 occurs when a user omits all or part of the utterance. The omission consists of two types: partial omission and total omission. To process the former, the algorithm first checks for missing essential cases in the case-frame. If the algorithm finds the omitted one, it fills the omitted one up and generates the supplemented result of the semantic analysis. For example, if a user says \"How much.'?\" when he/she pointsto model i00 on the screen, the algorithm assumes that he/she omitted the theme it and generates the new semantic result like \"How much is it?\". Then, it processes the result according to the same method as Case 1. In the latter case, the algorithm assumes that the user uttered either • 'ol~ol~.ffhis, please.)\" or"]},{"title":"\"ol~-~ol~.","paragraphs":["(These, please.)\" because he/she just pointed to an item/ite.ms without an utterance. After restoring the omitted utteranc.e, it can easily resolve the anaphora as Case 1.","2.2 The referring anaphora resolution algorithm The referring anaphora resolution algorithm finds referents by using previous utterances and visual information. In utterance (10) in Figure I, the user says, \" I'd like to buy this and the previous selection.\" while he/she points to model 100. The system can resolve th/s using the screen armphora resolution algorithm. However, the system cannot find the referred entity of the previous selection. The referring anaphora resolution algorithm resolves these kinds of anaphom. The algorithm is based on an extended centering algorithm with the dual cache model. The dual cache model consists of two slots and time points: visual slot, utterance slot, and screen switching-times as shown in Figure 4. The visual slot contains the. visual infommtion, Le.., items displayed on a screen. The utterance slot contains the centers of the user's ul~.amtces. The screen switching-time, which is illustrated by an arrow, keeps the time when the previous screen is switched to the current screen.

So,. the priority between anchors is:","utterance + a pointing gesture > utterance + visual information > utterance with no other information Figure 5: The priority of utterances Fmward-lookin 8 Centers, and Cb is the Backward.looking Center. A pair of Cb and Cf is called an anchor.","In the case of a language-only dialogue • system, anchors stack up according to LIFO mechanism because the system processes only utterance without co-occurring information like a gesture. However, anchors in the dual cache model should not follow the mechanism because each utterance contains different kinds of information occurring with it. For example, utterance (4) in Figure 1 occurs with a gesture. and utterance (9) contains visual information. To decide the priorities among anchors, we propose a priority rule as shown in Figure 5. The rule means that utterances eccmring with pointing gestures have the higher possibility to be focused in a future dialogue than those without pointing gestures. If anchors occur with the same kinds of informadon, they follow the mechanism. The reason why the algorithm should keep Vk in the dual cache model is that there are some anaphora referring to items which a user does not utter on the previous screen. As shown in utterance (5) in Figure 6, if the system does not keep. the visual information, it cannot resolve the previous red item because the user saw the color of model 200 through the visual channel but never uttered about the red item until utterance (5).","(1) U: I'd like to see some desks.","(2) $: (displaying model 200 and model 250)","We have these.","(3) U: I'd like to see some chairs, too.","(4) S: (displaying mode/100 and model 150)","We have these.","• (5) u: (poindng to model/00)","I'd like to buy this and the pr~ioas red item.

For example, the referent of the previous selection in utterance (I0) in Figure I should be focused among the entities displayed in the previous screen. In.such case. Cb(UO should be realized in the utterance Ue~j, where Ut is the current visual slot, and j is decided by the priority rule in Figure 5. In other words, when the system detects a time base modifier such as the previous, first, it must decide the correct visual slot and then apply centering heuristics to decide Cb(UO. The 4th constraint shows that the user's current gesture must not be related to the previous utterances. We already adopted this constraint in the screen anaphora resolution algoritlun in section 3.1. This constraint should also be applied to filter out unlike candidates.

During this process, it chocks whether Cj~Uij and CJ~UP~) are satisfied with the agreements, the grammatical functions and selectionaI restrictions (Brennan et al. (1987), Walker (1998)). In other words, the potential anchors are generated for each referring expression in an utterance and are specified for the agreements, the grammatical functions and the seloctional restrictions. Then, it filters off unsuitable anchors using the extended filters in Figure 9, which are based on the constraints and rules in Figure 7. If an anchor remains, it is regarded as a pair of Cb and Cfin the present utterance. For each anchor in the current list of anchors, apply the following filters derived from the centering constraints and rules.

Since Korean is similar in structure to Japanese (i.e. it is a free word order, headfinal language, with morphemic marking for grammatical function and topic), it would be interesting to see if the Cf ranking method can enhance our system's performance in multi-modal dialogue environment.
