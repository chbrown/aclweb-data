For example, \"I went into an old house last night. The roof was leaking badly and ...\" indicates that \"The roof' is associated with \"an old house,\" which has already been mentioned. This kind of reference (indirect anaphora) has not been thoroughly studied in natural language processing, but is important for coherence resolution, language understanding, and machine translation. We propose a method that will resolve the indirect anaphora in Japanese nouns by using the relationship between two nouns.","When we analyze indirect anaphora, we need a case frame dictionary for nouns that contains information about the relationship between two nouns. For instance, in the above example, the knowledge that \"roof\" is a part of a \"house\" is required to analyze the indirect anaphora. But no such noun case frame dictionary exists at present. We considered using the example-based method to solve this problem. In this case, the knowledge that \"roof\" is a part of \"house\" is analogous to \"house of roofi\" Therefore, we use examples of the form \"X of Y\" instead. In the above example, we use linguistic data such as \"the roof of a house.\" In the case of verbal nouns, we do not use \"X of Y\" but a verb case frame dictionary. This is because a noun case frame is similar to a verb case frame and a verb case frame dictionary does exist.","The next section describes a method for resolving indirect anaphora."]},{"title":"2 How to Resolve Indirect Anaphora","paragraphs":["Anaphors and antecedents in indirect anaphora have a certain relationship.

We detect some elements which could be analyzed by indirect anaphora resolution using \"X no Y\" and a verb case frame dictionary. When a noun was a verbal noun, we use a verb case frame dictionary. Otherwise, we use examples of \"X no V.\" For example, in the following example sentences kaiseki (analysis) is a verbal noun, and we use a case frame of a verb kaiseki-surn (analyze) for the indirect anaphora resolution of kaiseki (analysis). The case frame is shown in Table 2. In this table there are two case components, the ga-case (subject) and the wo-case (object).

We take possible antecedents from topics or loci in the previous sentences. We assign them a certain weight based on the plausibility that they are antecedents. The topics/foci and their weights are defined in Table 3 and Table 4. For example, in the case of \"I went into an old house last night. The roof was leaking badly and ..., .... an old house\" becomes a candidate of the desired antecedent. In the case of \"analysis\" in example sentence 2, \"electronic detectors,\" \"physicists,\" and \"large amounts of data\" be-come candidates of the two desired antecedents of \"analysis.\" In Table 3 and Table 4 such candidates are given certain weights which indicate preference.","3. We determine the antecedent by combining the weight of topics and foci mentioned in step 2, the weight of semantic similarity in \"X no Y\" or in a verb case frame dictionary, and the weight of the distance between an anaphor and its possible antecedent.

In the ga-case (subject), of three candidates, \"electronic detectors,\" \"physicists,\" and \"large amounts of data,\" only \"physicists\" satisfies the semantic constraint, human, in the case frame of the verb kaiseki-suru in Table 2. So \"physicists\" is selected as the desired antecedent of the ga-case. In the wo-case (object), two phrases, \"electronic detectors\" and \"large amounts of data\" satisfy the semantic constraints, abstract and product. By using the examples \"value\" and \"data\" in the case frame, the phrase \"large amounts of data,\" which is semantically similar to \"data\" in the examples of the case frame, is selected as the desired antecedent of the wo-case.","We think that errors made by the substitution of a verb case frame for a noun case frame are rare, but many errors occur when we substitute \"X no Y\" for a noun case frame. This is because \"X no Y\" (Y of X) has many semantic relationships, in particular a feature relationship (ex. \"a man of ability\"), which cannot be an indirect anaphoric relationship. To reduce the errors, we use the following procedures.","1. We do not use an example of the form \"Noun X no Noun ¥\" (Y of X), when noun X is an adjective noun [ex. HONTOU (reality)], a numeral, or a temporal noun. For example, we do not use honton (reality) no (of) hannin (criminal) (a real criminal).","2. We do not use an example of the form \"Noun X no Noun Y\" (Y of X), when noun Y is a noun that cannot be an anaphor of an indirect anaphora. For example, we do not use \"Noun X no tsurn (crane),\" or \"Noun X no ningen (human being).\" We cannot completely avoid errors by introducing the above procedure, but we can reduce them to a certain extent.","Nouns such as ichibu (part), tonari (neighbor) and betsu (other) need further consideration. When such a noun is a case component of a verb, we use information on the semantic constraints of the verb. We use a verb case frame dictionary as shown in Table 5. takusan-no kuruma-ga kouen-ni tomatte,ita.

In this case, kate (he) and hune (ship) are written as examples of things which can be used in the case component. This indicates that the antecedent is semantically similar to kare (he) and hune (ship). Since takusan no kuruma (many cars) is semantically similar to hune (ship) in the meaning of vehicles, it is judged to be the proper antecedent.","When such a noun as tonari (neighbor or next) modifies a noun X as tonari no X, we consider the antecedent to be a noun which is similar to noun X"]},{"title":"33","paragraphs":["Table 5: Case frame of verb \"mukad' (go to) Surface case Semantic constraint Examples ga-case (subject) concrete kare (he), hune (ship) n/-case (object) place kouen (park), minato (port) in meaning. ojiisan-wa ooyorokobi-wo-shite ie-ni kaerimashita.

Antecedents are determined by heuristic rules for each noun from left to right in the sentences. Using these rules, our system gives possible antecedents points, and it determines that the possible antecedent having the maximum total score is the desired antecedent. This is because a several types of information are combined in anaphora resolution. An increase in the points of a possible antecedent corresponds to an increase of the plausibility of the possible antecedent.","The heuristic rules are given in the following form: Condition ~ { Proposal, Proposal, ... } Proposal := ( Possible-Antecedent, Point ) Surface expressions, semantic constraints, referential properties, for example, are written as conditions in the Condition part. A possible antecedent is written in the Possible-Antecedent part. Point refers to the plausibility of the possible antecedent.","To implement the method mentioned in Section 2, we use the weights W of topics and foci, the distance D, the definiteness P, and the semantic similarity S (in R4 of Section 3.2) to determine points. The weights W oftopics and foci are given in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively in Section 2, and represent the preferability of the desired antecedent. In this work, a topic is defined as a theme which is described, and a focus is defined as a word which is stressed by the speaker (or the writer). But we cannot detect topics and foci correctly. Therefore we approximated them as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The distance D is the number of the topics (foci) between the anaphor and a possible antecedent which is a topic (focus). The value P is given by the score of the definiteness in referential property analysis (Murata and Nagao, 1993). This is because it is easier for a definite noun phrase to have an antecedent than for an indefinite noun phrase to have one. The value S is the semantic similarity between a possible antecedent and Noun X of \"Noun X no Noun Y.\" Semantic similarity is shown by level in Bunrui Goi Hyou (NLRI, 1964). 3.2 Heuristics for determining antecedents We wrote 15 heuristic rules for noun phrase anaphora resolution. Some of the rules are given below:","R1 When the referential property of a noun phrase (an anaphor) is definite, and the same noun phrase A has already appeared, =¢, { (the noun phrase A, 30)} A referential property is estimated by this method (Murata and Naga~, 1993). This is a rule for direct anaphora.","R2 When the referential property of a noun phrase is generic, =¢, { (generic, 10)}","R3 When the referential property of a noun phrase is indefinite, { (indefinite, 10)}","R4 When a noun phrase Y is not a verbal noun, ==~ { (A topic which has the weight W and the distanceD, W-D+P+S), (A focus which has the weight W and the distanceD, W-D+P+S), (A subject in a subordinate clause or a main clause of the clause, 23 -t- P + S) where the values W, D, P, and S are as they were defined in Section 3.1.","R5 When a noun phrase is a verbal noun, =~ { (A topic which satisfies the semantic constraint in a verb case frame and has the weight W and the distance D, W-D+P+S), (A focus which satisfies the semantic constraint and has the weight W and the distance D, W-D+P+S),"]},{"title":"34","paragraphs":["kono dorudaka-wa kyoulyou-wo gikushaku saseteiru.

Figure 1 shows that the noun koutei buai (official rate) is analyzed well. This is explained as follows:","The system estimated the referential property of koutei buai (official rate) to be indefinite in the method (Murata and Nagao, 1993). Following rule R3 (ection 3.2) the system took a candidate \"Indefinite,\" which means that the candidate is an indefinite noun phrase that does not have an indirect anaphoric referent. Following R4 (Section 3.2) the system took four possible antecedents, nisidoku (West Germany), jikokutuuka (own currency), kyoutyou (cooperation), dorudaka (dollar's surge). The possible antecedents were given points based on the weight of topics and foci, the distance from the anaphor, and so on. The system properly judged that nisidoku (West Germany), which had the best score, was the desired antecedent. 4 Experiment and Discussion Before the antecedents in indirect anaphora were determined, sentences were transformed into a case structure by the case analyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). The errors made by the analyzer were corrected by hand. We used the IPAL dictionary (IPAL, 1987) as a verb case frame dictionary. We used the Japanese Co-occurrence Dictionary (EDR, 1995) as a source of examples for \"X no Y.\"","We show the result of anaphora resolution using both \"X no Y\" and a verb case frame dictionary in Table 6. We obtained a recall rate of 63% and a precision rate of 68% when we estimated indirect anaphora in test sentences.

We also tested the system when it did not have any semantic information. The precision and the recall were lower. This indicates that semantic information is necessary. The experiment was performed by fixing all the semantic similarity values S to 0.","We also estimated the results for the hypothetical use of a noun case frame dictionary.

But we would achieve get a higher accuracy rate if we could utilize a good noun case frame dictionary. Therefore we have to consider how to construct a noun case frame dictionary. A key is to get the detailed meaning of \"no (of)\" in \"X no Y.\" If it is automatically obtainable, a noun case frame dictionary could be constructed automatically. Even if the semantic analysis of \"X no Y\" is not done well, we think that it is still possible to construct the dictionary using \"X no Y.\" For example, we arrange \"noun X no noun Y\" by the meaning of \"noun Y,\" arrange them by the meaning of \"noun X\", delete those where \"noun X\" is an adjective noun, and obtain the results shown in Table 7. In this case, we use the thesaurus dictionary \"Bunrui Goi Hyou\" (NLRI, 1964) to learn the meanings of nouns. It should not be difficult to construct a noun case frame dictionary by hand using Table 7. We will make a noun case frame dictionary by removing aite (partner) in the line of kokumin (nation), raihin (visitor) in the line of genshu (the head of state), and noun phrases which mean characters and features. When we look over the noun phrases for kokumin (nation), we no-tice that almost all of them refer to countries. So we will also make the semantic constraint (or the semantic preference) that countries can be connected to kokumin (nation). When we make a noun case frame dictionary, we must remember that examples of \"X no Y\" are insufficient and we must add examples. For example, in the line of genshu (the head of state) there are few nouns that mean countries. In this case, it is good to add examples by from the arranged nouns for kokumin (nation), which is similar to genshu (the head of state).
