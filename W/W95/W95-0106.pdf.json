Both methods build upon a formalism we recently introduced called stochastic inversion transduction grammars. The first approach borrows a coarse monolingual grammar into our bilingual formalism, in order to transfer knowledge of one language's constraints to the task of bracketing the texts in both languages. The second approach generalizes the inside-outside algorithm to adjust the grammar parameters so as to improve the likelihood of a training corpus. Preliminary experiments on parallel English-Chinese text are supportive of these strategies."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A number of empirical studies have found bracketing to be a useful type of corpus annotation (e.g., Pereira & Schabes 1992; Black et al. 1993). Bracketed corpora have been available for some time in English, and to some extent other European languages, the best-known example being perhaps the Penn Treebank (Marcus 1991). However, at present bracketed corpora for Chinese are unknown, as is the case for many other languages. Moreover, even for better-studied languages, parallel bracketed texts are scarce.","The problem of bracketing such corpora is the focus of two new strategies described in this paper. The strategies build upon stochastic inversion transduction grammars (SITGs), a formalism that we have been developing for bilingual language modeling. Numerous experiments have shown parallel bilingual corpora to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al. 1990; Gale & Church 1991 ; Gale et al. 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan et al. 1993; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994). SITGs are a generalization of context-free grammars that have several desirable properties for parallel corpus analysis; a brief summary of these properties is given in Section 2.","Our first strategy is to expropriate a very simple, coarse monolingual grammar of English as the backbone for a bilingual English-Chinese SITG, which is then used for bracketing parallel text. The effect of this is to transfer knowledge of English syntactic constraints (or more precisely, probabilistic preferences) to the bilingual task. This is discussed in Section 3.","Our second strategy is to apply an unsupervised training algorithm to tune the probabilistic parameters of the SITG. For this purpose we have devised an EM-based algorithm, a bilingual generalization of the 69 inside-outside method, that iteratively improves the likelihood of the training corpus. This is discussed in Section 4.","It is important to stress at the outset that"]},{"title":"aparallel bracketed","paragraphs":["corpus is different from a bracketed parallel corpus.

That is, the bilingual SITG parsing algorithm can perform constituent identification and matching using only a generic, language-independent bracketing grammar.","Several earlier experiments (Wu 1995a) tested out variants of this hypothesis, using generic SITGs similar to the one shown in Figure 2, which employs only one nonterminal category.

However, there are of course inherent limitations of any approach that relies entirely on crossing- and fanout-constrained lexical matching. In particular, if the sub-constituents of any constituent appear in the same order in both languages, lexical matchings do not provide the discriminative leverage to identify the sub-constituent boundaries. This applies to both straight and inverted orientations; an example with inverted orientation is shown in Figure 3. In such cases, specific grammatical information about one or both of the languages is needed.","Grammatical information is far less easily available for Chinese than for English, however, with respect to part-of-speech lexicons as well as grammars. The SITG formalism offers another possibility: the generic bracketing grammar can be replaced with a context-free backbone designed for English.","It is critical under this approach that the English grammar be reasonably robust. It should also avoid being too specific, since to be effective at bracketing, its structure must accomodate Chinese to a reasonably broad extent. For these reasons it is best to employ a simple, coarse grammar, with fallback productions that simulate the generic bracketing grammar when the English productions are too inflexible.","As before, the lexical productions will constitute the bulk of the rules set. However, we can now distinguish between different part-of-speech nonterminals. Different part-of-speech nonterminals may generate the same words. We can accomodate the fact that no Chinese part-of-speech lexicon is available with noninformative distributions as follows:","1.

These approaches can encounter difficulties with incompatibilities between the monolingual grammars used to parse the texts. The grammars will usually be of unrelated origins, not designed to make interlingual matching easy. Furthermore, how to deal with ambiguities presents another serious problem. Most sentences in the corpus will have multiple possible parses. In a pure \"parse-parse-match\" approach, however, the monolingual parsers must arbitrarily select one bracketing with which to annotate the corpus. The resulting parse may be incompatible with the parse chosen for the other half of the sentence-pair, causing a matching error even though some alternative parse might in fact been compatible.","The coarse bilingual grammar approach proposed here solves these problems by choosing the parse a Of course, this assumes that adequate grammars are available for both languages, contrary to our present assumptions. 74 S ~ ul/v~ S ~ ui/E S ---~ E/v~ VB ~ ui / v~ VB ~ ui / e VB ~ elvj NN ~ ui/v~ NN ~ ui l e NN ~ e/vj NP ~ ui / v~ NP ~ uile NP ~ Elvj IN ~ u~/vj IN ~ ui / E IN ~ EIv s DT ~ ui/vj DT ~ ui/e DT ~ e/vj miscellaneous verbs, auxiliary verbs nouns, adjectives pronouns prepositions determiners Figure 5: Lexical productions of a stochastic constituent-matching ITG. structure for both sentences simultaneously with the interlingual constituent matching criteria. The weighting of the bracketing constraints and matching constraints is probabilistic. Even if a sentence pair's translations truly contain structural mismatches that are beyond syntactic accounts, the soft constraint optimization permits graceful degradation in the bilingual parse. The parser will attempt to match those constituents for which a partial decomposition and matching can be found, parsing the rest largely according to the English grammar backbone.","More sophisticated \"parse-parse-match\" procedures postpone ambiguity resolution until the matching stage (Kaji et al. 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman 1994). This tactic bears closer resemblance to our approach, but still requires ad hoc heuristics to determine exactly how the matching task influences the monolingual parses that are chosen. On the other hand, the present framework incorporates all these aspects within a single probabilistic optimization.","Another alternative approach discussed in Wu (1995b) is to first use a monolingual grammar to bracket only the English half of the text, followed by a SITG parallel bracketing procedure constrained by the English brackets. However, this hybrid approach is subject to the same incompatibility and ambiguity problems that arise for pure \"parse-parse-match\" procedures; thus the proposed coarse bilingual grammar approach is superior for the same reasons given above.","For our experiments, we employed the grammar shown in Figures 4 and 5, with only 50 syntactic productions and 13 nonterminal categories, including 6 part-of-speech categories. Each syntactic production occurs in both straight and inverted orientations, to model ignorance of the ordering tendencies of the corresponding Chinese constituents. The part-of-speech categories were designed by conflating categories in the Brown corpus tagset, under the following general principle: categories should be as broad as possible, while still maintaining reasonable discriminativeness for bracketing structure. Thus, notice that adjectives and nouns are conflated, since complex nominal phrases have largely similar parse structures regardless of 75 the difference between adjective and noun labels. Similarly, all verbs including auxiliaries are grouped to allow simple tail-recursive compounding. The S category (not to be confused with the start symbol SO) is a placeholder for miscellaneous items including punctuation and adverbs, and functions as a fallback category similar to the A nonterminal in the generic bracketing grammars.","Probabilities were placed on the syntactic productions uniformly, but all inverted productions were They are right to do so","SO[","so[","They/~ NP","Vl[","vo[ are/* VB V0<","right/~ VB","v0[","to/* VB","v0[","*/~ VB","vO[","do/~ VB","*/+~ v0","IV0","IV0","IV0 >v0","Iv0","so/* NP","]vl","]so","./o S0","]s0","The Authority will be accountable to the Financial Secretary","so[","so[","Ni<","Ni[ The/* DT Authority/~ NN","] N1","*/~ PP",">Ni","vl[","will/~ VB","Ni< Ni[","be/* DT","accountable/~ NN ]Ni PP[","to/* IN","Ni[","the/* DT","NO [","*/~ NN","NO [","Financial/~ NN","Secretary/* NO","]NO","]NO","]Ni ]PP",">Ni","]Vl","IS0","./o S0","]SO Figure 6: Sample outputs with a coarse bilingual grammar. 76 assigned a slightly smaller probability in order to break ties in favor of straight matchings. Probabilities were placed on the lexical productions as discussed above, with the following additional provisions. The translation lexicon was automatically learned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994). The latter stage gives us the lexical translation probabilities. The translation lexicon contained approximately 6,500 English words and 5,500 Chinese words, and was not manually corrected for this experiment, having about 86% translation accuracy. The English part-of-speech lexicon with relative frequencies was derived from the English portion of our corpus as tagged by Brill's (1993) tagger.","Our preliminary experiments show improved parsing behavior in general, compared to generic bracketing grammars. Examples of the output are shown in Figure 6. The latter example shows problematic behavior on the example given earlier in Figure 3 of sentence pairs without sufficient ordering discrimination. Although an attempt is made in this case to fit the English constraints, the main difficulty is that the translation \"so/~ ~\" was missing from the automatically-learned lexicon; also, the simple grammar lacks infinitival clauses."]},{"title":"4 An EM Algorithm for Training SITGs","paragraphs":["An unavoidable consequence of using more structured, complex grammars--coarse though they may be--is that the bilingual matching process becomes more sensitive to the syntactic production probabilities than under the earlier generic bracketing grammar approaches. Performance therefore suffers if the probabilities are not appropriate, a serious problem given that the syntactic production probabilities above are manually, and arbitrarily, set to be uniform.","It therefore becomes desirable to find means to tune the syntactic production probabilities automatically, so as to be optimal with respect to some training data set. Note that we do not expect the parallel training corpus to be parsed or otherwise syntactically annotated beforehand. To this end we present an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm for iteratively improving the syntactic production parameters of a SITG, according to a likelihood criterion. The method is a generalization of the inside-outside algorithm for SCFG estimation (Baker 1979; Lari & Young 1990).","A few notational preliminaries: we will denote the sentence pairs by (E, C) where the English sentence E -- el,..., eT and the corresponding Chinese sentence C = cl,... , ev are vectors of observed symbols (that is, lexemes or words).
