Current algorithms for bilingual lexicon compilation rely on occurrence frequencies, length or positional statistics derived from parallel texts. There is little correlation between such statistics of a word and its translation in non-parallel corpora. On the other hand, we suggest that words with productive context in one language translate to words with productive context in another language, and words with rigid context translate into words With rigid context. Context heterogeneity measures how productive the context of a word is in a given domain, independent of its absolute occurrence frequency in the text. Based on this information, we derive statistics of bilingual word pairs from a non-parallel corpus. These statistics can be used to bootstrap a bilingual dictionary compilation algorithm."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Building a domain-specific bilingual lexicon is one significant component in machine translation and machine-aided translation systems. These terms are often not found in standard dictionaries. Human translators, not being experts in every technical or regional domain, cannot produce their translations effectively. Automatic:compilation of such a bilingual lexicon in specific domains is therefore highly desirable.","We present an algorithm in finding word correlation statistics for automatic bilingual lexicon compilation from a non-parallel corpus in Chinese and English. Most previous automatic lexicon compilation techniques require a sentence-aligned clean parallel bilingual corpus (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al. 1993; Wu & Xia 1994). We have previously shown an algorithm which extracts a bilingual lexicon from noisy parallel corpus without sentence alignment (Fung & McKeown 1994; Fung 1995). Although bilingual parallel corpora have been available in recent years, they are still relatively few in comparison to the large amount of monolingual text. Acquiring and processing of parallel corpora are usually labour-intensive and time-consuming. More importantly, the existence of a parallel corpus in a particular domain means some translator has translated it, therefore, the bilingual lexicon compiled from such a corpus is at best a reverse engineering of the lexicon this translator used. On the other hand, if we can compile a dictionary of domain-specific words from non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts, the results would be much more meaningful and useful.","This research is partly supported by the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 173","As demonstrated in all the bilingual lexicon compilation algorithms, the foremost task is to identify word features which are similar between a word and its translation, yet different between a word and other words which are not its translations. In parallel corpora, this feature could be the positional co-occurrence of a word and its translation in the other language in the same sentences (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al. 1993; Wu & Xia 1994) or in the same segments (Fung & Church 1994; Fung 1995). In a non-parallel corpus, there is no corresponding sentence or segment pairs, so the co-occurrence feature is not applicable. In Fung & McKeown (1994); Fung (1995), the word feature used was the positional difference vector. Whereas this is more robust than sentence co-occurrence feature, the matching between two positional difference vectors presumes the two texts are rough translations of one anther. Moreover, whereas the occurrence frequency of a word and that of its translation are relatively similar in a parallel corpus, they have little correlation in non-parallel texts. Our task is, therefore, to identify a word feature correlating a pair of words even if they appear in texts which are not translations of each other. This feature should also be language and character set independent, i.e. it should be applicable to pairs of languages very different from each other. We propose that"]},{"title":"context heterogeneity","paragraphs":["is such a feature."]},{"title":"2 A Non-parallel Corpus of Chinese and English","paragraphs":["We use parts of the HKUST English-Chinese Bilingual Corpora for our experiments (Wu 1994), consisting of transcriptions of the Hong Kong Legislative Council debates in both English and Chinese. We use the data from 1988-1992, taking the first 73618 sentences from the English text, and the next 73618 sentences from the Chinese text. There are no overlapping sentences between the texts. The topic of these debates varies though is to some extent confined to the same domain, namely the political and social issues of Hong Kong. Although we select the same number of sentences from each language, there are 22147 unique words from English, and only 7942 unique words from Chinese."]},{"title":"3 Some Linguistic Characteristics of Chinese","paragraphs":["We have chosen Chinese and English as the two languages from which we will build a bilingual dictionary. Since these languages are significantly different, we need to develop an algorithm which does not rely on any similarity between the languages, and which can be readily extended to other language pairs.","It is useful to point out some significant differences between Chinese and English in order to help explain the output of our experiments: Chinese texts have no word delimiters. It is necessary to perform tokenization on the text by using a Chinese tokenizer. Since the tokenizer is not perfect, the word translation extraction process is affected by this preprocessing. Chinese part-of-speech classes are very ambiguous; many words can be both adjective or noun, noun or verb. Many adjectives can also act as adverbs with no morphological change. Chinese words have little or no morphological information. There are no inflections for nouns, adjectives or verbs to indicate gender, number, case, tense or person (Xi 1985). There is no capitalization to indicate the beginning of a sentence. There are very few function words in Chinese compared to other languages, especially to English. Moreover, function words in Chinese are frequently omitted. 174","5 A vast number of acronyms are employed in Chinese, which means many single words in Chinese can be translated into compound words in English. Hong Kong Chinese use many terms borrowed from classical Chinese which tend to be more concise. The usage of idioms in Chinese is significantly more frequent than in English.","Points 3,4, and 5 contribute to the fact that the Chinese text of our corpus has fewer unique words than in English."]},{"title":"4 Context Heterogeneity of a Word","paragraphs":["In a non-parallel Corpus, a domain-specific term and its translation are used in different sentences in the two texts. Take the example of the word air in the English text. Its concordance is shown partly in Table 4. It occurred 176 times. Its translation ~ occurred 37 times in the Chinese text and part of its concordance is shown in Table 4, They are used in totally different sentences. Thus, we cannot hope that their occurrence frequencies would correspond to each other in any significant way.","On the other hand, air/~ are domain-specific words in the text, meaning something we breathe, as opposed to of some kind of ambiance or attitude. They are used mostly in similar contexts, as shown in the concordances. If we look at the content word preceding air in the concordance, and the content word following it, we notice that air is not randomly paired with other words. There are a limited number of word bigrams (x, W) and a limited number of word bigrams (W, y) where W is the word air; likewise for ~. The number of such unique bigrams indicate a degree of heterogeneity of this word in a text in terms of its neighbors.","We define the context heterogeneity vector of a word W to be an ordered pair (x, y) where: a","left heterogeneity x = -; c b","fight heterogeneity y = -; c","a = number of different types of tokens immediately preceding W in the text; b = number of different types of tokens immediately following W in the text; c = number of occurrences of W in the text;","The context heterogeneity of any function word, such as the, would have x and y values very close to one, since it can be preceded or followed by many different words. On the other hand, the x value of the word am is small because it always follows the word I.","We postulate that the context heterogeneity of a given domain-specific word is more similar to that of its translation in another language than that of an unrelated word in the other language, and that this is a more salient feature than their occurrence frequencies in the two texts.","For example, the context heterogeneity of air is (119/176, 47/176) = (0.676, 0.267) and the context heterogeneity of its translation in Chinese, ~ is (29/37, 17/37) = (0.784, 0.459). The context heterogeneity of the word (~k~/adjournment, on the other hand, is (37/175, 16/175) = (0.211, 0.091). Notice that although air and (~k~ have similar occurrence frequencies, their context heterogeneities have very different","i 175 values, indicating that air has much more productive context than (~N. On the other hand, gg~ has more similar context heterogeneity values as those of air even though its occurrence frequency in the Chinese text is much lower.

This is because in most Asian languages, there are very few function words compared to Indo-European languages. Function words in Chinese or Japanese are frequently omitted. This partly contributes to the fact that there are far fewer Chinese words than English words in two texts of similar lengths.","Since these functions words such as the, a, of will affect the context heterogeneity of most nouns in English while giving very little information, we filter them out from the English text. This heuristic greatly increased the context heterogeneity values of many nouns. The list of function words filtered out are the, a, an, this, that, of, by, for, in, to. This is by no means a complete list of English function words. More vigorous statistical training methods could probably be developed to find out which function words in English have no Chinese correspondences. However, if one uses context heterogeneity in languages having more function words such as French, it is advisable that filtering be carried out on both texts."]},{"title":"7 Experiment 1: Finding Word Translation Candidates","paragraphs":["Given the simplicity of our current context heterogeneity measures and the complexity of finding translations from a non-parallel text in which many words will not find their translations, we propose to use context heterogeneity only as a bootstrapping feature in finding a candidate list of translations for a word.","In our first experiment, we hand-compiled a list of 58 word pairs as in Tables 3 and 4 in English and Chinese, and then used 58 by 58 context heterogeneity measures to match them against each other.

Chinese tokenization is a difficult problem and tokenizers always have errors. Most single Chinese characters can be joined with other character(s) to form different words. So the translation of a single Chinese character is ill-defined. Moreover, in some cases, our Chinese tokenizer groups frequently co-occurring characters into a single word that does not have independent semantic meanings. For example, (~/-th item, number.
