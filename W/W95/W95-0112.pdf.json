However, annotating a corpus is time-consuming and difficult. We propose that conceptual patterns for information extraction can be acquired automatically using only a preclassified training corpus and no text annotations. We describe a system called AutoSlog-TS, which is a variation of our previous AutoSlog system, that runs exhaustively on an untagged text corpus. Text classification experiments in the MUC-4 terrorism domain show that the AutoSlog-TS dictionary performs comparably to a hand-crafted dictionary, and actually achieves higher precision on one test set. For text classification, AutoSlog-TS requires no manual effort beyond the preclassified training corpus. Additional experiments suggest how a dictionary produced by AutoSlog-TS can be filtered automatically for information extraction tasks. Some manual intervention is still required in this case, but AutoSlog-TS significantly reduces the amount of effort required to create an appropriate training corpus."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In the last few years, significant progress has been made toward automatically acquiring conceptual patterns for information extraction (e.g., [Riloff, 1993; Kim and Moldovan, 1993]). However, previous approaches require an annotated training corpus or some other type of manually encoded training data. Annotated training corpora are expensive to build, both in terms of the time and the expertise required to create them. Furthermore, training corpora for information extraction are typically annotated with domain-specific tags, in contrast to general-purpose annotations such as part-of-speech tags or noun-phrase bracketing (e.g., the Brown Corpus [Francis and Kucera, 1982] and the Penn Treebank [Marcus"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1993]). Consequently, a new training corpus must be annotated for each domain.","We have begun to explore the possibility of using an untagged corpus to automatically acquire conceptual patterns for information extraction. Our approach uses a combination of domain-independent linguistic rules and statistics. The linguistic rules are based on our previous system, AutoSlog [Riloff, 1993], which automatically constructs dictionaries for information extraction using an annotated training corpus. We have put a new spin on the original system by applying it exhaustively to an untagged but preclassified training corpus (i.e., a corpus in which the texts have been manually classified as either relevant or irrelevant). Statistics are then used to sift through the myriad of patterns that it produces. The new system, AutoSlog-TS, can generate a conceptual dictionary of extraction patterns for a domain from a preclassified text corpus. 148","First, we give a brief overview of information extraction and the CIRCUS sentence analyzer that we used in these experiments. Second, we describe the original AutoSlog system for automated dictionary construction and explain how AutoSlog was adapted to generate patterns from an untagged corpus.

Information extraction systems are domain-specific because they extract facts about a specific domain and typically ignore information that is not relevant to the domain.: For example, an information extraction system for the terrorism domain might extract the names of perpetrators, victims, physical targets, and weapons associated with terrorist events mentioned in a text. The information extraction task has received a lot of attention recently as a result of the message understanding conferences (MUCs) [MUC-5 Proceedings, 1993; MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992; MUC-3 Proceedings, 1991].","The systems described in this paper use a conceptual sentence analyzer called CIRCUS [Lehnert, 1991].

A few systems have been developed recently to build dictionaries for information extraction automatically, such as AutoSlog [Riloff, 1993] and PALKA [Kim and Moldovan, 1993]. These systems generate extraction patterns automatically using a set of associated answer keys or an annotated training corpus.

For example, consider the sentence \"John Smith was kidnapped by three armed men.\" To identify \"John Smith\" as the victim of a kidnapping, we must recognize that he is the subject of the passive verb \"kidnapped.\" Similarly, to identify \"three armed men\" as the perpetrators, we must recognize that \"three armed men\" is the object of the preposition \"by\" and attaches to the verb \"kidnapped.\" It is impossible to look at an isolated noun phrase such as \"John Smith\" and determine whether he is a perpetrator or a victim without considering local context. annotated corpus"]},{"title":"!","paragraphs":["World Trade Center source texl \"The World Trade Center was bombed by terrorists.\""]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["(~ ~ World Trade Center (~ (:°ncept N°des: l ~lb was bombed ~ ~ x> was bombed : by terrorists Figure 2: AutoSlog flowchart","AutoSlog uses simple domain-independ.ent linguistic rules to create extraction patterns for a given set of noun phrases in a text corpus. Figure 2 shows the steps involved in dictionary construction. As input, AutoSlog requires a set of annotated texts in which the noun phrases that need to be extracted have been tagged. 1 For each \"targeted\" noun phrase, AutoSlog finds the sentence in which it was tagged 2 and passes the sentence to CIRCUS for syntactic analysis.","1Alternatively, a set of answer keys that list the relevant noun phrases (e.g., the MUC-4 answer keys) could be used (e.g., see [Riloff, 1993]).","2If AutoSlog does not know which sentence the noun phrase came from, it searches for the first sentence in the text that contains the noun phrase. We adopted this strategy in earlier experiments that used the MUC-4 answer keys as input [Riloff, 1993]. 150 I CIRCUS separates each sentence into clauses and identifies the subject, verb, direct object and prepositional phrases in each clause. AutoSlog then determines which clause contains the targeted noun phrase and whether it is a subject, direct object, or prepositional phrase.","Next, AutoSlog uses a small set of heuristics to infer which other words in the sentence identify the role of the noun phrase. If the targeted noun phrase is the subject or direct object of a clause then AutoSlog infers that the verb defines the role of the noun phrase. AutoSlog uses several rules to recognize different verb forms. In the subject case, consider the sentence \"John Smith killed two people\" and the targeted noun phrase \"John Smith\" tagged as a perpetrator. AutoSlog generates a concept node that is triggered by the verb \"killed\" and activated when the verb appears in an active construction; the resulting concept node recognizes the pattern \"X killed\" and extracts X as a perpetrator. Given the sentence \"John Smith was killed\" with \"John Smith\" tagged as a victim, AutoSlog generates a concept node that recognizes the pattern \"X was killed\" and extracts X as a victim.","In the direct object case, the sentence \"the armed men killed John Smith\" produces the pattern \"killed X.\" If the targeted noun phrase is in a prepositional phrase, then AutoSlog uses a simple pp--attachment algorithm to attach the prepositional phrase to a previous verb or noun in the sentence which is then used as a trigger word for a concept node. For example, \"the men were killed in Bogota by John Smith\" produces the pattern \"killed by X.\" It should be noted that, although we are using a simple phrase-like notation for the patterns, they are actually concept nodes activated by an NLP system so the words do not have to be strictly adjacent in the text.

The heuristics are divided into three categories depending upon where the targeted noun phrase is found. The location is indicated by the bracketed item (subject, direct-object, noun-phrase in a PP).

The underlined word represents the trigger word, the bracketed item represents the type of information that will be extracted by the concept node, and the remaining words represent the required context.","In previous experiments, we used AutoSlog to construct a dictionary for the MUC-4 terrorism domain using 772 relevant texts from the MUC-4 corpus. AutoSlog created 1237 concept node definitions, but many of these concept nodes represented general expressions that will not reliably extract relevant information. Therefore, we introduced a human-in-the-loop to weed out the unreliable definitions. A person manually reviewed all 1237 definitions and retained 450 of them for the final dictionary. The resulting dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of a dictionary that was hand-crafted for the MUC-4 terrorism domain [Riloff, 1993].","One of the main differences between AutoSlog and previous lexical acquisition systems is that AutoSlog creates new definitions entirely from scratch. In contrast, previous language learning systems (e.g., [Jacobs and Zernik, 1988; Carbonell, 1979; Granger, 1977]) create new definitions based on the definitions of other known words in the context. That is, they assume that some definitions already exist and use those definitions to create new ones. The structures created by AutoSlog are also considerably different than the lexical definitions created by most systems, although the PALKA system [Kim and Moldovan, 1993] creates similar extraction patterns. The main difference between PALKA and AutoSlog is that PALKA is given the set of keywords associated with each concept (essentially its \"trigger words\") and then learns to generalize the patterns surrounding the keywords. In contrast, AutoSlog infers the trigger words and patterns on its own but does not generalize them."]},{"title":"3.2 AutoSlog-TS:","paragraphs":["Automated Dictionary Construction Without Text Annotations As described in the previous section, AutoSlog requires an annotated training corpus in which the noun phrases that should be extracted have been tagged. Creating an annotated corpus is much easier than building a dictionary by hand. However, the annotation process is not trivial. It may take days or even weeks for a domain expert to annotate several hundred texts. 5 But perhaps even more importantly, the annotation process is not always well-defined; in many cases, it is not clear which portions of a text should be annotated. Complex noun phrases (e.g., conjunctions, appositives, prepositional phrases) are often confusing for annotators. Should the entire noun phrase be tagged or just the head noun? Should modifiers be included? Should prepositional phrases be included? Conjuncts and appositives? These issues are not only frustrating for a user, but can have serious consequences for the system. A noun phrase that is incorrectly annotated often produces an undesirable extraction pattern or produces no extraction pattern at all.","To bypass the need for an annotated corpus, we created a new version of AutoSlog that does not rely on text annotations..The new system, Autoslog-TS, can be run exhaustively on an untagged but preclassified corpus. None of the words or phrases in the texts need to be tagged, but each text must be classified as either relevant or irrelevant to the targeted domain. 6 Figure 4 shows the steps involved in dictionary construction. The process breaks down into two stages:","5In a preliminary experiment, a user annotated 160 texts in about 8 hours.","6It is important for the training corpus to be representative of the texts expected in the future. For text classification tasks, the irrelevant texts should reflect the types of texts that will need to be distinguished from relevant texts. For example, many of the irrelevant texts in the MUC-4 corpus describe military actions so the resulting AutoSlog-TS dictionary is especially well-suited for discriminating texts describing military incidents from those describing terrorist incidents. 152 preclassified texts"]},{"title":"Stage 1 1 (Concept Nodes: ) ~S: World Trade Center","paragraphs":["fA~utoSIo~\"N I"]},{"title":"J V: was bombed","paragraphs":["~I~ ~ Heurixt~.e"]},{"title":"~ll~] <x> was bombed PP: by terrorists ~ ~bombed by <y>","paragraphs":["preclassified texts Stage 2"]},{"title":"x> was bombed 87%","paragraphs":["( Concept Node ~ =~$1P'~ [bombed b y.<y> 84% / \" Dictionary: ~ I <w> was ~culez | ~ ~<z>saw 63% 1 49% J ]<w> was killed |<x> was bombed |bombed by <y> \\<z> saw Figure 4: AutoSlog-TS flowchart Stage 1: Generating Concept Nodes . Given a corpus of preclassified texts, a sentence analyzer (CIRCUS) is applied to each sentence to identify all of the noun phrases in the sentence. For example, in Figure 4, two noun phrases are identified: \"The World Trade Center\" and \"terrorists.\" . For each noun phrase, the system determines whether the noun phrase was a subject, direct object, or prepositional phrase based on the syntactic analysis produced by the sentence analyzer. . All of the appropriate heuristics are fired. For example, in Figure 4 \"The World Trade Center\" was identified as the subject of the sentence so all of the subject patterns are fired (patterns #1-5 in Figure 3). Pattern #3 is the only one that is satisfied, so a single concept node is generated that recognizes the pattern \"X was bombed.\" It is possible for multiple heuristics to fire; for example, patterns #1 and #2 may both fire if the targeted noun phrase is the subject of an active verb and takes a direct-object. After processing the training texts, we have a huge collection of concept nodes. The second stage involves collecting statistics to determine which concept nodes represent domain-specific expressions. Stage 2: Statistically Filtering the Concept Nodes","1. All of the newly generated concept nodes are loaded into the system and the training corpus is run through the sentence analyzer again.

We calculate the"]},{"title":"relevancy rate","paragraphs":["of each concept node (i.e., the number of occurrences in relevant texts divided by the total number of occurrences), and the frequency of each concept node (i.e., the total number of times it was activated in the corpus).","After Stage 1, we have a large set of concept node definitions that, collectivelyl can extract virtually 7 every noun phrase in the corpus. Most of the concept nodes represent general phrases that are likely to occur in a wide variety of texts (e.g., \"X saw\"). However, some of the concept nodes represent domain-specific patterns (e.g., \"X was bombed\"). Stage 2 is designed to identify these concept nodes automatically under the assumption that most of them will have high relevancy rates. In other words, if we sort the concept nodes by relevancy rates then the domain-specific patterns should float to the top.","One of the side effects of this approach is that the statistics provide feedback on which heuristics are most appropriate. In previous work with AutoSlog, we found that some domains require longer extraction patterns than others [Riloff, 1994]. In particular, we found that simple verb forms usually suffice as extraction patterns in the terrorism domain (e.g., \"X was killed\"). But in the joint ventures domain, good extraction patterns often require both verbs and nouns (e.g., \"X formed venture\" is better than \"X formed\"). For this reason, we found it necessary to run AutoSlog with slightly different rule sets in these domains. In contrast, AutoSlog-TS simply allows all applicable heuristics to fire s , often producing multiple extraction patterns of varying lengths, and lets the statistics ultimately decide which ones work the best. For example, \"X formed\" would presumably have a much lower relevancy rate than \"X formed venture\" in the joint ventures domain. The original version of AutoSlog could have applied multiple heuristics as well, but its dictionary had to be manually filtered so it was preferable to keep the dictionary small. Since AutoSlog-TS uses statistical filtering, we don't have to worry as much about the number of concept nodes generated and therefore don't need separate rule sets.","However, determining which concept nodes are ultimately \"useful\" depends on how one intends to use them. We are interested in using the concept nodes for two tasks: information extraction and text classification. These tasks place different demands on the concept node dictionary.","A good dictionary for information extraction should contain patterns that provide broad coverage of the domain. In general, useful patterns fall into one of two categories: (a) patterns that frequently extract relevant information and rarely extract irrelevant information or (b) patterns that frequently extract relevant information but often extract irrelevant information as well. Patterns of type (a) should have high relevancy rates. Patterns of type (b) are more difficult to identify but will occur with high frequency in relevant texts. Section 4.2 presents experiments with concept node filtering techniques for the information extraction task.","A good dictionary for text classification should contain patterns that frequently occur in relevant texts but rarely occur in irrelevant texts.

Roughly 50% of the texts are classified as relevant. AutoSlog-TS produced a dictionary of 32,345 unique concept nodes. To reduce the set of patterns down to a manageable size, we eliminated all concept nodes that were proposed exactly once, under the assumption that a pattern encountered only once is unlikely to be of much value. AutoSlog-TS often proposes the same pattern multiple times and keeps track of how often each pattern is proposed.

The AutoSlog-TS dictionary achieved higher recall (up to 100%), which makes sense considering that the AutoSlog-TS dictionary is much bigger than the hand-crafted dictionary. But the hand-crafted dictionary achieved higher precision at recall levels above 60-65%. This is probably because the hand-crafted dictionary was filtered manually, which ensures that all of its concept nodes are relevant to the domain (although not all are useful as classifiers). In contrast, the AutoSlog-TS dictionary was not filtered manually so the statistics are solely responsible for separating the relevant concept nodes from the irrelevant ones.

For example, AutoSlog-TS produced 158 concept nodes that have a relevancy rate > 90% and frequency > 5. Only 45 of these concept nodes were in the original AutoSlog dictionary. Figure 10 shows a sample of some of the new concept nodes that represent patterns associated with terrorism. 16 was assassinated in X assassination in X X ordered assassination was captured by X capture of X X managed to escape was exploded in X damage in X X expressed solidarity was injured by X headquarters of X perpetrated on X was kidnapped in X targets of X hurled at X was perpetrated on X went_off on X carried_out X was shot in X X blamed suspected X was shot_to_death on X X defused to protest X X was hit X injured to arrest X Figure 10: Patterns found by AutoSlog-TS but not by AutoSlog","These results suggest that combining domain-independent linguistic rules with simple filtering techniques is a promising approach for automatically creating dictionaries of extraction patterns. Although it may still be necessary for a human to review the resulting patterns to build an information extraction system, this approach eliminates the need for text annotations and relies only on preclassified texts."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["AutoSlog-TS demonstrates that conceptual patterns for information extraction can be acquired automatically from only a preclassified text corpus, thereby obviating the need for an annotated training corpus. Generating annotated corpora is time-consuming and sometimes difficult, though the payoffs are often significant. General purpose text annotations, such as part-of-speech tags and noun-phrase bracketing, are costly to obtain but have wide applicability and have been used successfully to develop statistical NLP systems (e.g., [Church, 1989; Weischedel"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1993]). Domain-specific text annotations, however, require a domain expert and have much narrower applicability.","From a practical perspective, it is important to consider the human factor and to try to minimize the amount of time and effort required to build a training corpus. Domain-specific text annotations are expensive to obtain, so our goal has been to eliminate our dependence on them. 15As we stated in Section 3.1, it took a person only 5 hours to review the 1237 concept nodes produced by","AutoSlog [Riloff, 1993]. 16The connected words represent phrases in CIRCUS' lexicon. 160 We have shown that a more coarse level of manual effort is sufficient for certain tasks. We have shown how a preclassified training corpus can be combined with statistical techniques to create conceptual patterns automatically. We believe that it is much easier for a person to separate a set of texts into two"]},{"title":"piles","paragraphs":["(the relevant texts and the irrelevant texts) than to"]},{"title":"generate","paragraphs":["detailed text annotations for a domain.
