By using efficient data structures, we extend the notion of PST to unbounded vocabularies. We also show how to use a Bayesian approach based on recursive priors over all possible PSTs to efficiently maintain tree mixtures. These mixtures have provably and practically better performance than almost any single model. Finally, we evaluate the model on several corpora. The low perplexity achieved by relatively small PST mixture models suggests that they may be an advantageous alternative, both theoretically and practically, to the widely used n-gram models."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Finite-state methods for the statistical prediction of word sequences in natural language have had an important role in language processing research since Markov's and Shannon's pioneering investigations (C.E. Shannon, 1951). While it has always been clear that natural texts are not Markov processes of any finite order (Good, 1969), because of very long range correlations between words in a text such as those arising from subject matter, low-order alphabetic n-gram models have been used very effectively for such tasks as statistical language identification and spelling correction, and low-order word n-gram models have been the tool of choice for language modeling in speech recognition. However, low-order n-gram models fail to capture even relatively local dependencies that exceed model order, for instance those created by long but frequent compound names or technical terms. Unfortunately, extending model order to accommodate those longer dependencies is not practical, since the size of n-gram models is in principle exponential on the order of the model.","Recently, several methods have been proposed (Ron et al., 1994; Willems et al., 1994) that are able to model longer-range regularities over small alphabets while avoiding the size explosion caused by model order. In those models, the length of contexts used to predict particular symbols is adaptively extended as long as the extension improves prediction above a given threshold. The key ingredient of the model construction is the prediction suffix tree (PST), whose nodes represent suffixes of past input and specify a predictive distribution over possible successors of the suffix. It was shown in (Ron et al., 1994) that under realistic conditions a PST is equivalent to a Markov process of variable order and can be represented efficiently by a probabilistic finite-state automaton. For the purposes of this paper, however, we will use PSTs as our starting point.","The problem of sequence prediction appears more difficult when the sequence elements are words rather than characters from a small fixed alphabet. The set of words is in principle unbounded, since 95 in natural language there is always a nonzero probability of encountering a word never seen before. One of the goals of this work is to describe algorithmic and data-structure changes that support the construction of PSTs over unbounded vocabularies. We also extend PSTs with a wildcard symbol that can match against any input word, thus allowing the model to capture statistical dependencies between words separated by a fixed number of irrelevant words.","An even more fundamental new feature of the present derivation is the ability to work with a mixture of PSTs. Here we adopted two important ideas from machine learning and information theory. The first is the fact that a mixture over an ensemble of experts (models), when the mixture weights are properly selected, performs better than almost any individual member of that ensemble (DeSantis et al., 1988; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 1993). The second idea is that within a Bayesian framework the sum over exponentially many trees can be computed efficiently using a recursive structure of the tree, as was recently shown by Willems et al. (1994). Here we apply these ideas and demonstrate that the mixture, which can be computed as almost as easily as a single PST, performs better than the most likely (maximum aposteriori -- MAP) PST.","One of the most important features of the present algorithm that it can work in a fully online (adaptive) mode. Specifically, updates to the model structure and statistical quantities can be performed adaptively in a single pass over the data. For each new word, frequency counts, mixture weights and likelihood values associated with each relevant node are appropriately updated. There is not much difference in learning performance between the online and batch modes, as we will see. The online mode seems much more suitable for adaptive language modeling over longer test corpora, for instance in dictation or translation, while the batch algorithm can be used in the traditional manner of n-gram models in sentence recognition and analysis.","From an information-theoretic perspective, prediction is dual to compression and statistical modeling. In the coding-theoretic interpretation of the Bayesian framework, the assignment of priors to novel events is rather delicate. This question is especially important when dealing with a statistically open source such as natural language. In this work we had to deal with two sets of priors. The first set defines a prior probability distribution over all possible PSTs in a recursive manner, and is intuitively plausible in relation to the statistical self-similarity of the tree. The second set of priors deals with novel events (words observed for the first time) by assuming a scalable probability of observing a new word at each node. For the novel event priors we used a simple variant of the Good-Turing method, which could be easily implemented online with our data structure. It turns out that the final performance is not terribly sensitive to particular assumptions on priors.","Our successful application of mixture PSTs for word-sequence prediction and modeling make them a valuable approach to language modeling in speech recognition, machine translation and similar applications. Nevertheless, these models still fail to represent explicitly grammatical structure and semantic relationships, even though progress has been made in other work on their statistical modeling. We plan to investigate how the present work may be usefully combined with models of those phenomena, especially local finite-state syntactic models and distributional models of semantic relations.","In the next sections we present PSTs and the data structure for the word prediction problem. We then describe and briefly analyze the learning algorithm. We also discuss several implementation issues. We conclude with a preliminary evaluation of various aspects of the model On several English corpora. 96 i"]},{"title":"2 Prediction Suffix Trees over Unbounded Sets","paragraphs":["Let U C E* be a set of words over the finite alphabet ~E, which represents here the set of actual and future words of a natural language. A prediction suffix tree (PST) T over U is a finite tree with nodes labeled by distinct elements of U* such that the root is labeled by the empty sequence e, and if s is a son of s' and s' is labeled by a 6 U* then s is labeled by wa for some w 6 U. Therefore, in practice it is enough to associate each non-root node with the first word in its label, and the full label of any node can be reconstructed by following the path from the node to the root. In what follows, we will often identify a PST node with its label.","Each PST node s is has a corresponding.prediction function 7s : U' --+ [0, 1] where U' C U U {¢} and ¢ represents a novel event, that is the occurrence of a word not seen before in the context represented by s. The value of 7, is the next-word probability function for the given context s. A PST T can be used to generate a stream of words, or to compute prefix probabilities over a given stream. Given a prefix wl...wk generated so far, the context (node) used for prediction is found by starting from the root of the tree and taking branches corresponding to Wk, wk-1, • • • until a leaf is reached or the next son does not exist in the tree. Consider for example the PST shown in Figure 1, where some of the values of% are: 7'andthefirst'(world) = 0.1, 7'andthefirst'(time) = 0.6 , 7,andthefirst,(boy) = 0.2 , 7,andthefirst,(~b) ---- 0.i . When observing the text ~... long ago and the first', the matching path from the root ends at the node 'and the first'. Then we predict that the next word is time with probability 0.6 and some other word not seen in this context with probability 0.1. The prediction probability distribution 7s is estimated from empirical counts. Therefore, at each node we keep a data structure to track of the number of times each word appeared in that context.","A wildcard symbol, '*', is available in node labels to allow a particular word position to be ignored in prediction. For example, the text '... but this was' is matched by the node label 'this"]},{"title":"*',","paragraphs":["which ignores the most recently read word 'was'.

A trigram model, for instance, is a PST of depth two, where the leaves are all the observed bigrams of words. The prediction function at each node is the trigram conditional probability of observing a word given the two preceding words."]},{"title":"3 The Learning Algorithm","paragraphs":["Within the framework of online learning, it is provably (see e.g. (DeSantis et al., 1988; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 1993)) and experimentally known that the performance of a weighted ensemble of models, each model weighted according to its performance (the posterior probability of the model), is not worse and generally much better than any single model in the ensemble. Although there might be exponentially many different PSTs in the ensemble, it has been recently shown (Willems et al., 1994) that a mixture of PSTs can be efficiently computed for small alphabets. 97 3 2 Figure 1: A small example of a PST of words for language modeling.

After predicting 99 the next word the counts are updated simply by increasing by one the count of the word, if the word already exists, or by inserting a new entry for the new word with initial count set to one. Based on this scheme several n-gram estimation methods, such as Katz's backoff scheme (Katz, 1987), can be derived. Our learning algorithm has, however, the advantages of not being limited to a constant context length (by setting D to be arbitrarily large) and of being able to perform online adaptation. Moreover, the interpolation weights between the different prediction contexts are automatically determined by the performance of each model on past observations.","In summary, for each observed word we follow a path from the root of the tree (back in the text) until a longest context (maximal depth) is reached. We may need to add new nodes, with new entries in the data structure, for the first appearance of a word. The likelihood values of the mixture of subtrees (Equation 8) are returned from each level of that recursion up to the root node. The probability of the next word is then the ratio of two consecutive likelihood values returned at the root.","For prediction without adaptation, the same method is applied except that nodes are not added and counts are not updated. If the prior probability of the wildcard, j3, is positive, then at each level the recursion splits, with one path continuing through the node labeled with the wildcard and the other through the node corresponding to the proper suffix of the observation. Thus, the update or prediction time is in that case o(2D). Since D is usually very small (most currently used word n-grams models are trigrams), the update and prediction times are essentially linear in the text length.","It remains to describe how the probabilities, P(wls ) = 7s(w) are estimated from empirical counts. This problem has been studied for more than thirty years and so far the most common techniques are based on variants of the Good-Turing (GT) method (Good, 1953; Church and Gale, 1991). Here we give a description of the estimation method that we implemented and evaluated. We are currently developing an alternative approach for cases when there is a known (arbitrarily large) bound on the maximal size of the vocabulary U.","Let nl,n2,..s s . ,nr,S respectively, be the counts of occurrences of words wl, w2, • .., w~, at a given context (node) s, where r\" is the total number of different words that have been observed at node s. The total text size in that context is thus n\" = ~1 n~. We need estimates of 7,(wl) and of 7,(w0) the probability of observing a new word w0 at node s. The GT method sets 7,(w0) - t_~- , -- ns , where tl is the total number of words that were observed only once in that context. This method has several justifications, such as a Poisson assumption on the appearance of new words (Fisher et al., 1943). It is, however, difficult to analyze and requires keeping track of the rank of each word. Our learning scheme and data structures favor instead any method that is based only on word counts. In source coding it is common to assign to novel events the probability ~+r\" In this case the probability 7,(wl) of a word that has been observed n~ times is set to n~ As reported in (Witten and Bell, 1991), the performance of this method is similar to the GT estimation scheme, yet it is simpler since only the number of different words and their counts are kept.","Finally, a careful analysis should be made when predicting novel events (new words). There are two cases of novel events: Ca) an occurrence'of an entirely new word~ that has never been seen before in any context; (b) an occurrence of a word that has been observed in some context, but is new in the current context.","The following coding interpretation may help to understand the issue. Suppose some text is communicated over a channel and is encoded using a PST. Whenever an entirely new word is observed (first case) it is necessary to first send an indication of a novel event and then transfer the identity of that word (using a lower level coder, for instance a PST over the alphabet E in which the words in U are written. In the second case it is only necessary to transfer the identity of the word, 100 by referring to the shorter context in which the word has already appeared. Thus, in the second case we incur an additional description cost for a new word in the current context. A possible solution is to use a shorter context (one of the ancestors in the PST) where the word has already appeared, and multiply the probability of the word in that shorter context by the probability that the word is new. This product is the probability of the word.","In the case of a completely new word, we need to multiply the probability of a novel event by an additional factor"]},{"title":"Po(wn)","paragraphs":["interpreted as the prior probability of the word according to a lower-level model.

Thus, a PST being build online may only need to store information about those words for a short period. It may then be advantageous to prune PST nodes and remove small counts corresponding to rarely used words. Pruning is performed by removing all nodes from the suffix tree whose counts are below a threshold, after each batch of K observations. We used a pruning frequency K of 1000000 and a pruning threshold of 2 in some of our experiments.","Pruning during online adaptation has two advantages. First, it improves memory use. Second, and less obvious, predictive power may be improved. Rare words tend to bias the prediction functions at nodes with small counts, especially if their appearance is restricted to a small portion of the text. When rare words are removed from the suffix tree, the estimates of the prediction probabilities at each node are readjusted reflect better the probability estimates of the more frequent words. Hence, part of the bias in the estimation may be overcome.","To support fast insertions, searches and deletions of PST nodes and word counts we used a hybrid data structure.

Further experiments using longer maximal depth and allowing comparisons with existing n-gram models trained on the full (280 million word) NAB corpus will require improved data structures and pruning policies to stay within reasonable memory limits."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Further Work","paragraphs":["PSTs are able to capture longer correlations than traditional fixed order n-grams, supporting better generalization ability from limited training data. This is especially noticeable when phrases longer than a typical n-gram order appear repeatedly in the text. The PST learning algorithm allocates a proper node for the phrase whereas a bigram or trigram model captures only atruncated version of the statistical dependencies among words in the phrase.","Our current learning algorithm is able to handle moderate size corpora, but we hope to adapt it to work with very large training corpora (100s of millions of words). The main obstacle to those applications is the space required for the PST. More extensive pruning may be useful for such large training sets, but the most promising approach may involve a batch training algorithm that builds a compressed representation of the PST final from an efficient representation, such as a suffix array, of the relevant subsequences of the training corpus. 104"]},{"title":"Tezt Mazimal Depth Perplezity","paragraphs":["(or = 0.5)"]},{"title":"Perplezity","paragraphs":["(MAP Model) Bible","(Gutenberg Project) Paradise Lost","by John Milton Brown Corpus 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 411.3 172.9 149.8 141.2 139.4 139.0 861.1 752.8 740.3 739.3 739.3 739.3 564.6 407.3 396.1 394.9 394.5 394.4 411.3 172.9 150.8 143.7 142.9 142.7 861.1 752.8 746.9 747.7 747.6 747.5 564.6 408.3 399.9 399.4 399.2 399.1 Table 2: The perplexity of PSTs for the batch mode.","Negative Log.
