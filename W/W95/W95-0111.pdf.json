INTRODUCTION As we are facing the growing amount of on-line text, the use of text analysis techniques to access information from electronic sources has become more popular and, at the same time, more difficult. Currently, the effectiveness of such techniques is evaluated not only on how easily they can be applied to text sources to extract information and represent it in a systematic format (Walker 1983), but also on whether they can be applied to large text corpora of several tens of thousand of words. One of the applications of text analysis is to identify and extract significant terminology from running text. Choueka (1988), for example, describes an experiment for locating interesting collocational expressions from large textual databases. A collocational expression, as Choueka defines it, is =sequences of words whose unambiguous meaning cannot be dedved from that of their components\". Other representative collocation research can be found in Church and Hanks (1990) and Smadja (1993). Though all statistically-based, their definitions of collocations are different from one another. Unlike Choueka (1988), Church and Hanks (1990) identify as collocations both interrupted and uninterrupted sequences of words. Unlike Church and Hanks (1990), Smadja (1993) goes beyond the \"two-word\" limitation and deals with \"collocations of arbitrary length\". 131 The primary goal of collocation research is to build a comprehensive lexicographic toolkit, or to assist automatic language generation applications. Therefore, the focus is on the extraction of all Interesting word pattems without distinction of domain specificity. Identifying domain-specific terminology is another research effort. Gierl and Frost (1992) descdbe their approach to extracting terminological knowledge from medical texts. Following Church and Hanks (1990), they use mutual information to select significant two-word patterns, but, at the same time, a lexical inductive process is incorporated which, as they claim, can improve the collection of domain-specific terms. Justeson and Katz (1993) introduce an algorithm by which technical terms in running text can be identified. Prior to the development of their algorithm, they performed a thorough study on the linguistic properties of technical terminology. They report that, structurally, technical terms make heavy use of noun compounds. In technical terminology, word constituents are limited to adjectives, nouns and occasionally prepositions. Verbs, adverbs, or conjunctions are extremely rare. At the discourse level, technical terms tend to be repetitive. With these observations in mind, they developed an algorithm which has proved to be effective and domain independent. In this paper, a preliminary experiment is presented in automatically suggesting significant terms for a predefined topic. The general method is to compare a topic focused sample based on the predefined topic with a larger and more general base sample. A set of statistical measures are used to identify significant word units in both samples. Identification of single word terms is based on the notion of word intervals. Two-word terms are identified through the computation of mutual information, and an extension of mutual information assists in capturing multi-word terms. Once significant terms of all these three types are identified, a comparison algorithm is applied to differentiate terms across the two samples. If significant changes in the values of certain statistical variables are detected, associated terms are selected from the focused sample as being topic-oriented and included in a suggested list. To check the quality of the suggested terms, we compare them against terms manually determined by a domain expert. Though the numbers of matches vary, we find that our automatic suggestion process provides more terms (than the manual process) that are useful for describing the predefined topic. 2. METHODOLOGY 2.1 Manual versus Automatic Term Suggestion TO manually select significant terms for a predefined topic, the domain expert first creates a topic focused sample from one specific source or a combination of sources. Then, he or she reads the documents, providing a relevance judgment (i.e. a reader-assigned score) to each document. By carefully examining relevant documents in the focused sample, a list of terms that are deemed to be significant for the definition of the topic is identified. In many cases, it is possible that the domain expert would introduce some terms based on his or her own professional knowledge about the topic. These terms may be highly prominent for the topic, yet may not necessarily occur in the focused sample. 132 For automatic suggestion of topical terms, initial attempts were made using the sample documents the domain expert created. The results were not impressive. The statistical Information generated from the sample documents was not rich and sufficient enough for any discriminative judgment. Our experience showed that, to draw terms that are reflective of a given topic, a much larger and more general base sample is required. Such a base sample should be randomly sampled from the same source as the focused sample and it should contain an array of different topics. Once the baseline statistics are generated from both data collections, a meaningful comparison could spot terms that occur with unusual frequency in the focused sample. These terms would constitute good candidates for topically sensitive terminological units (Steier and Belew 1994)."]},{"title":"2.2 Focused Sample and Base Sample","paragraphs":["For our experiments of automatic term suggestion, we selected a predefined topic called \"European Politics and Business\". The focused sample was originally created by the domain expert using the 1988 United Press International (UPI). Table 1 presents statistical information about this dataset. After reading each of the relevant documents found in the focused sample, the domain expert manually determined 347 topical terms. Table 2 provides the statistical breakdown of these terms. Table 1: Focused and Base Samples Data File Source/Name Size (bytes) Unique Words Focused Sample Sample from 1988 UPI 1,015200 12,065 (5,045\")","Base Sample Sample from 27,322,598 73,583 (33,114\") 1987,1988,1989 UPI * only words which occur more than 3 times were used in the experiments Table 2: Predefined Topic and its Manually Determined Topical Terms","Predefined Topic one-word two.word multi.word total terms i European Politics & Business 276 36 35 347 Since the focused sample was drawn from the source of 1988 UPI, the construction of its corresponding base sample was also initiated from the same source of the same year. Our experiments demonstrated that, in order to obtain a random assortment of topics to be included in the base sample, it may be meaningful to sample documents from the time pedod before and after the focused documents. Therefore, the final base sample was created by randomly drawing documents from the years of 1987, 1988 and 1989. The size of this dataset is about 27 times larger than the sample data file (see Table 1 ). 133 Though the ratio between the focused and base samples was arbitrary, in order to generate meaningful statistics, we felt that the base sample should be at least 20 times larger in size than the focused sample. (For the sake of discussion, hereafter, we may sometimes refer to the focused sample as \"focused\" and the base sample as \"base\".)"]},{"title":"2.3 Experimental Procedure","paragraphs":["The general method we adopted is as follows. First, we identified statistically significant terms from both samples. Next, a comparison algorithm was applied to these two sets of terms to single out those that were common to both samples, yet whose patterns of occurrences differed between these two samples. Finally, we analyzed and presented this set of terms as content odented candidates for the predefined topic, in this case \"European Politics and Business\". The terms suggested are split into three categones: single word terms, two-word terms and multi-word terms (or phrases). The following three sections descnbe in detail the methods for generating each of the three categories."]},{"title":"2.4 Suggesting Single Word Terms","paragraphs":["Automatically suggesting single word terms as being topically oriented has been most challenging. Our experiments indicated that the ffirst order\" statistics, probability and entropy alone, are not sufficient for gathering information about the topicality of a word in running text. The information in both measurements is essentially equivalent since entropy is just the log inverse of probability. We found that the \"second-order\" statistics, such as vadance or standard deviation of term frequencies across documents, provide greater insight into topicality. We selected the interval between the occurrences of a word as the basis for analysis. Our intuitions led us to believe that topical single words should appear more frequently and more regularly, i.e. at approximately even intervals, in the focused sample than in the base sample. The focused sample represents, more or less, a topical sublanguage set while the base sample a general language set. Unlike probability and entropy statistics which yield average scores for the whole document, the use of interval makes it possible to get an \"instantaneous\" measure at any location in the document. More specifically, an interval can be measured \"instantaneously\" at any point in the text between the occurrences of a particular word. Though using interval alone might still not be sufficient for identifying word topicality, it allowed us to measure the vadance which would help identify words that were always changing in their rate of occurrences. Thus, three scores were generated for each word: the mean log interval, the standard deviation of the mean log interval, and the normalized standard deviation of the mean log interval. The use of a log scale for these measurements is to minimize the effect of unduly large variations in words with long mean intervals. The normalized standard deviation is produced by simply dividing the raw standard deviation by the mean log interval. In most cases, raw standard deviation is found to be larger for words having long mean intervals. In order to compare the standard deviations across words of different intervals, we found this normalization process quite useful. 134 i After scores were generated for all the words in both the focused sample and the base sample, score comparisons between the two samples were carried out in two ways: comparing the intervals and comparing the standard deviations. To compare the intervals, the =base\" mean log interval was subtracted from the \"focused\" mean log Interval and divided by the raw standard deviation from the base sample. The result represents the change of mean log intervals. More explicitly, it yields the number of standard deviations that the \"focused\" mean log interval is different from the =base\" mean log interval. The more negative;the value, the more significant the change, and the more prominent the word would appear in the focused sample. To compare the standard deviations, the normalized =base\" standard deviation was subtracted from the normalized \"focused\" standard deviation. The difference symbolizes how the word is distributed in ~e focused sample. The more negative the value is, the more \"bursty\" the word is distributed, and the more likely it is content oriented since \"content words tend to appear in 'bursts\" (Church and Mercer 1993). If a single word term is found in both data samples and it receives negative scores from both interval and standard deviation comparisons, it would be included in the suggested list as being topical onented."]},{"title":"2.5 Suggesting Two-Word Terms","paragraphs":["The method for suggesting two-word terms tumed out to be much simpler than that for single word terms though the same techniques are equally applicable. Here, the traditional mutual information score was used. As stated in Church, et al. (1991) and elsewhere, the mutual information measurement can be expressed as:",". (:p(WlW2)) l(WlW2) = lÂ°g~,p(wl)p(w2) where"]},{"title":"p(wlw2)","paragraphs":["is the frequency in the data collection of the two-word compound (wl ,w2); and"]},{"title":"p(wl)","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"p(w2)","paragraphs":["the frequency of the word constituents. The highest mutual information score indicates that the individual probabilities are low while the two words occur together frequently. Two steps led to our automatic suggestion of topic-oriented two-word terms. First, the mutual information score was computed for each pair of words that occur in each of the two samples. To capture topicality, we were only interested in pairs of words with high mutual information scores. Therefore, any pair which contained =closed class\" words, such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, or single letters, digit numbers, or overly common verbs like \"give\", \"take\", etc., were excluded. Such an exclusion not only helped getting pairs of words with high mutual information scores, but also sped up computation significantly. A threshold value was also set such that if any two-word unit occurred less than 3 times in the sample or received a mutual information score lower than 6.0, it was eliminated and would not participate in the next comparison measurement. 135 With the mutual information scores in hand, a \"delta\" score was generated by subtracting the \"base\" mutual information score from the ffocused\" mutual information score. Topically, prominent two-word terms normally have lower scores in the focused sample that is \"keyed\" to their topic. This is because the constituent words distribute in wider range of contexts. The probability of them occurring separately increases relative to the probability of them occurring together (Steier and Belew 1994). Therefore, the more negative the \"delta\" score, the more topically sensitive the two-word term is. If a two-word term occurs in both data samples and receives a negative \"delta\" score, it would be included in the suggested list as being topically onented."]},{"title":"2.6 Suggesting Multi-Word Terms","paragraphs":["When automatically suggesting content two-word terms, we looked at the mutual information scores for adjacent words. For multi-word terms, the mutual information score was calculated for non-adjacent words. Our intuitions led us to believe that if there is a significant statistical linkage, i.e. a high mutual information score, between such a pair of words, it is highly possible that they belong to a larger linguistic component. Our first step was to compute mutual information scores for a word unit separated by a distance of two (i.e. having one unspecified word separating them). Two cdteda apply when selecting \"interesting\" word units. Their mutual information score must be 10 or greater. Following the observations by Steier and Belew (Steier and Belew1994), we only selected pairs which received lower mutual information score in the focused sample than in the base sample. Once an \"interesting\" word unit of distance two was selected, a concordance was built of all sentences containing that word unit. These sentences were compared for matching text. If a stdng of text was found to include that word unit and, at the same time, occur most frequently in the concordance, its leading and trailing \"closed-set\" words (if any) were chopped off. The remaining text stdng was presented as a suggested multi-word term. 3. RESULTS and DISCUSSION 3.1 Suggested Single"]},{"title":"Terms","paragraphs":["The focused sample drawn from the 1988 UPI data contains 12,065 unique words. Among them, 5,045 are frequent enough (occurring 3 times or more) to calculate statistics for our experiments (refer to Table 1). The comparison algorithm identified 2,010 suggested terms based on the fact that they received negative scores for both \"change of mean log interval\" and \"distribution burstiness\" comparisons. These negative scores indicate that these single word terms have shorter intervals and more regular occurrences in the focused sample. We compared the suggested list against the single word terms manually selected by the domain expert. The results are summarized in Table 3. 136 Table 3: Statistics of the Suggested Single Word Terms suggested 2,010 Comparison of Suggested and Manual Terms","total manual 276","not possible* 129","no statistics* 91 possible* 56 hits 42 percent included 75% * not possible: terms not existing In the focused sample * no statbtics: terms which have less than 3 occurrences in the focused sample * possible: targeted terms Of the 276 topical single terms determined by the domain expert, 129 terms do not exist in the focused sample. As explained earlier, these are the terms intellectually introduced by the domain expert. Almost half of these terms are geographical names in Europe, such as albania, albertville, andorra, barcelona, belarus, belorus, bosnia, byelorussia, chancellors, comecon, cp, croatia, erm, eurocurrency, eurofed, europeanization, europeanwide, europeenne, europewide, gaullist, gaullists, gilbraltar, greenland, guemsey, kazakhstan, kirghizia, kirgizia, kyrgystan, kzakhstan, labour, liechtenstein, moldavia, moldova, monaco, nc, nib, nicosia, nuuk, pentagonale, reunify, reykjavik, salzburg, sicily, slovenia, svalbard, tadzhikistan, tajikistan, tajikstan, tirana, tirane, tories, torshavn, turkmenia, turkmenistan, uk, ussr, uzbekistan, vaduz, valletta, weu Of the remaining 147 actually occurring terms, 91 are not frequent enough to be included in our experiments.

Further analysis of the missing 14 terms reveals that they were not found in the suggested list due to the statistical constraints we established for our experiments. As shown in Table 4, 13 of these terms received negative scores either for \"change of mean log interval\" or for \"distribution burstiness', but not for both. We believe that their inclusion is possible since they represent what we would call \"border-line\" suggested terms. 137 Table 4: =Missed\" single word terms single.word term dgtl dgt2 dgt3 dgt4 dgt5 dgt6 dgt7 dgt8 portugal 10 13.75 0.26 16.86 0.23 3.83 -0.81 0.03 europeans 23 12.55 0.35 15.64 0.32 4.98 -0.62 0.03 eec 3 15.49 0.39 19.28 0.32 6.21 -0.61 0.06 luxembourg 12 13.49 0.42 17.06 0.36 6.07 -0.59 0.07 !copenhagen 3 15.49 0.47 18.54 0.34 6.23 -0.49 0.14 i ;~ cyprus 6 14.49 0.44 18.28 0.43 7.89 -0.48 0.01 yugoslavia 12 13.49 0.47 15.33 0.37 5.66 -0.32 0.10 finland 10 13.75 0.51 15.52 0.46 7.19 -0.25 0.05 kgb 5 14.75 0.57 16.41 0.44 7.29 .-0.23 0.13 sweden 13 13.38 0.48 14.26 0.44 6.33 -0.14 0.03 turkey 11 13.62 0.53 14.47 0.50 7.25 -0.12 0.03 czechoslovakia 9 13.91 0.09 13.70 0.46 6.29 0.03 -0.36 switzerland 9 13.91 0.21 13.81 0.47 6.48 0.01-0.26","Statistics Measurements (dgt = digit) dgtl: number of occurrences On the focused sample) dgt2: mean log interval (in the focused sample) dgt3: normalized SD of mean log interval (in the focused sample) dgt4: mean log interval (in the base sample) dgtS: normalized SD of mean log interval (in the base sample) dgt6: raw SD of mean log interval (in the base sample) dgt7: ((2nd digit - 4th digit) / 6th digit)) dgtS: (3rd digit.

CONCLUSION This paper presents a preliminary experiment in identifying significant terminological units from running text. By comparing a focused sample randomly drawn for a predefined topic against a larger and more general base sample, we can automatically suggest topic-oriented terms based on the detection of significant changes in some statistical measurements. Our experiment on one predefined topic demonstrated that, compared to the manual selection of the topical terms, our suggested lists do contain more useful terms that can be used to descdbe the topic. We also found that the method is efficient enough for applications to very large textual corpora. Our next step is to further refine the methods by carrying out more experiments across different topics. We mentioned a number of times that our methods were developed based on our intuitive assumptions or hypotheses. More experiments on more topics will prove whether we can obtain positive and consistent results. Identification of significant terms from running text can be very useful in building intelligent information management systems. Terms identified are good candidates for key word indexing of electronic sources. Topic specificity can assist in grouping or clustering on-line documents. For an information retrieval system, terms identified for a pre-determined subject can be used to develop specialized libraries or files for targeted user groups. Our experiment demonstrated that the methods described can identify vadous people names, organization enlJties and other proper names. Those special text tokens are important for constructing text extraction systems."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["This research was done while the second author worked at LEXIS-NEXIS dudng the summer of 1994.
