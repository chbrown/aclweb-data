Each couplet consists of two phrases, called hemistichs. Syllables in all of the hemistichs of a given Ghazal follow the same pattern of heavy and light syllables. Such a pattern introduces a musical rhythm, called metre. Metre is one of the most important properties of Persian poems and the reason why usual Persian grammar rules can be violated in poems, especially the order of the parts of speech. There exist Figure 1: Elements of a typical Ghazal (by Hafez, calligraphed by K. Khoroush). Note that Persian is right to left in writing. about 300 metres in Persian poems, 270 of which are rare, the vast majority of poems composed only from 30 metres (Mojiry and Minaei-Bidgoli, 2008).","Ghazal traditionally deals with just one subject, each couplet focusing on one idea. The words in a couplet are thus very correlated. However, depending on the rest of the couplets, the message of a couplet could often be interpreted differently due to the many literature techniques that can be found in Ghazals, e.g. metaphors, homonyms, personifica-tion, paradox, alliteration.","For this study, we downloaded from the Ganjoor poems website1",", with free permission to use, a Ghazal collection corresponding to 30 poets, from Hakim Sanai (1080) to Rahi Moayyeri (1968), with a total of 17, 939 Ghazals containing about 170, 000 couplets. The metres, as determined by experts (Shamisa, 2004), are also provided for most poems.","1","http://ganjoor.net/. 23","We put a lot of effort into the preprocessing, so as to provide more informative input to the modeling step. For this, we built a lexicon supporting both modern and ancient Persian, as explained in Section 2. In addition, we developed several preprocessing tools for Persian and adapted them to poems, as detailed in Section 3. In the analysis step, exploiting Probabilistic Topic Models (Blei, 2012), promising results were obtained as described in Section 4: strong correlation between poets and topics was found by the model, as well as relevant patterns in the dynamics of the topics over years; good correlation between topics and poem metre was also observed."]},{"title":"2 Modern and Ancient Persian Lexicon","paragraphs":["This section presents the Persian lexicon we built, which supports both modern and ancient Persian words and morphology and provides lemmas for all forms. This lexicon could thus be useful to many research projects related to both traditional and modern Persian text processing. Its total size is about 1.8 million terms, including the online version2 of the largest Persian Dictionary today (Dehkhoda, 1963). This is quite large in comparison with e.g. the morphological lexicon provided by Sagot & Walther (2010), of about 600k terms in total. 2.1 Verbs Taking advantage of the verb root collection provided by Dadegan group (Rasooli et al., 2011), we conjugated all of the regular forms of the Persian verbs which exist in modern Persian using grammars provided by M. R. Bateni (1970), and added them with their root forms (lemmas) to the lexicon. We also added ancient grammatical forms, referring to ancient grammar books for Persian (Bateni, 1970; P. N. Xan￿lari, 2009).","Persian verb conjugation seems to be simple: normally each verb has two roots, past and present. In each conjugated form, the corresponding root comes with some prefixes and attached pronouns in a predefined order. However, phonological rules introduce some difficulties through so-called mediators. For instance, the verb نتسارآ (ârâstan, meaning ”to decorate” or ”to attire”) has ارآ (ârâ) as present root 2 http://www.loghatnaameh.org/. and تسارآ (ârâst) as past root. Its injunctive form requires it to be preceded by ـِب (be), leading to اراب (beârâ). However, according to phonological rules, when a consonant attaches to آ (â), a ـی (y) is introduced as a mediator. So the correct injunctive form is ارايب (byârâ, “decorate!”).","Mediators occur mainly when a consonant comes before â or when a syllable comes after â or و (u). But the problem is slightly more complicated. For instance, the present verb for نتسج (jostan, “seek-ing”) is وج (ju). Thus when the pronoun مَـ (am, “I”) is attached, the conjugated form should be میوج (juyam, “I seek”), with a mediator. However, the root ju has also a homograph jav (also written وج ) which is the present root of ندیوج (javidan, “chew-ing”). Since here و is pronounced v, not u, there is no need for a mediator and the final form is موج (javam, “I chew”). Therefore, naively applying the above mentioned simple rules is wrong and we must proceed more specifically. To overcome this kind of problem, we studied the related verbs one by one and introduced the necessary exceptions.","In poems, things are becoming even more complicated. Since metre and rhyme are really key parts of the poem, poets sometimes waives the regular structures and rules in order to save the rhyme or the metre (Tabib, 2005). For instance, F. Araqi in one of his Ghazals decided to use the verb form یانم (mi-nâyi, “you are not coming”) which does not follow the mediator rules, as it must be یاینم (mi-naâyayi). The poet decided to use the above form, which still makes sense, to preserve the metre.","The problem of mediators aside, the orders of parts in the verb structures are also sometimes changed to preserve the metre/rhyme. For instance in the future tense, the compound part of compound verbs has normally to come first. A concrete example is given by the verb درپس دهاوخ ناج (jân xâhad sepord means “(s)he will give up his spirit and will die”), which is written by Hafez as: ناج درپس دهاوخ (xâhad sepord jân). To tackle these variations, we included in our lexicon all the alternative forms mentioned by Tabib (2005).","As already mentioned, the considered poem collection ranges from 1080 to 1968. From a linguistics point of view some grammatical structures of the language have changed over this long period of time. For instance, in ancient Persian the prefix for 24 the continuity of verb was مه (hami); today only م (mi) is used. Many kinds of changes could be observed when ancient grammars are compared to the modern one. The relevant structures to the mentioned period of time were extracted from a grammar book of ancient Persian (P. N. Xan￿lari, 2009) and included in our lexicon.","Starting from the 4,162 infinitives provided by Dadegan group (Rasooli et al., 2011) and considering ancient grammars, mediators, and properties of poetic forms, we ended up with about 1.6 million different conjugated verb forms. The underly-ing new structures have exhaustively been tested by a native Persian graduate student in literature and linguistics. This validation took about one hundred hours of work, spot-checking all the conjugations for random selected infinitives. 2.2 Other words (than verbs) The verbs aside, we also needed a complete list of other words. The existing usual Persian electronic lexica were insufficient for our purpose because they are mainly based on newspapers and do not necessarily support ancient words. For our purpose, the ongoing effort of Dehkhoda Online Dictionary3","looked promising. Dehkhoda dictionnary (Dehkhoda, 1963) is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27,000 pages), entailing over 45 years of efforts by Aliakbar Dehkhoda and other experts and it is still ongoing. The Dehkhoda Online Dictionary Council fortunately approved our request to use their work which currently contains 343,466 entries (for 234,425 distinct forms).","Besides the Dehkhoda Online Dictionary, we added the free Virastyar Persian lexicon4",". Although the is size is one tenth of Dehkhoda’s, it contains several new imported words, not found in Dehkhoda. All together, we ended up with a lexicon of 246,850 distinct surface forms. For each surface form, we also provide the list of corresponding roots (lemmas). 3 http://www.loghatnaameh.org/. 4 http://www.virastyar.ir/data/."]},{"title":"3 Preprocessing","paragraphs":["Preprocessing is an essential part in NLP which usually plays an important role in the overall performance of the system. In this work, preprocessing for Persian Ghazals consists of tokenization, normalization, stemming/lemmatization and filtering. 3.1 Tokenization The purpose of tokenization is to split the poems into word/token sequences. As an illustration, a hemistich like","نانهد نیریش ورسخ نادق داشمش هاش is split into the following tokens: نانهد / نیریش / ورسخ / نادق / داشمش / هاش.","The tokenization was done using separator characters like white spaces, punctuation, etc. However, half-spaces made this process quite complicated, as most of them appeared to be ambiguous.","Half-space is a hidden character which avoids preceding letters to be attached to the following letters; the letters in Persian having different glyphs when attached to the preceding letters or not.","For instance, تفرم (mi-raft, “was going”), here written with a half-space separating its two parts, mi (م) and raft (تفر) would be written تفریم without the half-space (notice the difference in the middle).","Half-spaces carry useful information, e.g. for recognizing compound words. However, they were not reliable enough in the poem collection used.","The main challenges we had to face related to half-spaces were related to continuous verbs. In Persian, continuous verbs have a prefix mi (م)which should be separated from the rest of the verb by a half-space. However, it was sometimes written using full-spaces and sometimes even without any space at all. For instance mi-goft (“was saying”) should be written with a half-space: تفگم but was sometimes written using a full space: تفگ م, and even sometimes without any separator: تفیم. The problem of identifying continuous verbs is even more complicated in poems because the prefix (mi) is the homograph of a word meaning “wine” (mey: م), quite frequent in Persian poems.","For dealing with continuous verbs, we apply the following heuristic: in the structure of continuous verbs, the prefix mi comes before the root of verbs, thus, if a root of a verb comes just after a mi, then we 25 can consider it as a continuous verb. However, many mi’s meaning wine would be considered as prefixes using this too simple heuristic, because the most frequent letter in Persian آ (â) is also a verb root. For instance, in phrase mey-e-âsemâni: نامسآ م , mey means “wine” and the second part نامسآ means “related to heaven” (as an adjective, not a verb). To consider mi as a prefix, we thus constrained the token after it to start with a root longer than 2 letters.","The mentioned rule improves the process of tokenization. However, there are still some cases which are really complicated even for a human to decide. For instance, mi-âlud: دولآ م (“was polluting”) and mey-âlud: دولآ م (“polluted with wine”) are homographs in Persian; whose precise tokenization requires contextual information or even metre to decide which one is more suited. As a simple solution we can consider mey-âlud and any other known compound forms of mey as compound words and add them to our lexicon. Taking the advantages of this solution for such ambiguous words, we can identify if there is any ambiguity and given that there is some, we can pass all of them to the next processing steps, not deciding too soon.","Continuous verbs aside, present perfect verbs, prefix verbs, and compound verbs have also two parts which might be separated with half-space or full white-space. For instance, rafteh-am (“have gone”) might appear with a half-space: ماهتفر , without any separator: ماهتفر , or with a full space: ما هتفر.","Since the tokenization was complicated and requires linguistic knowledge, especially to properly handle half-spaces, we designed it in two steps: first a basic version to bootstrap the process before character normalization (next subsection), and later a refinement of the basic tokenization, taking advantage of the rich Persian lexicon we built.","As a first tokenization step, we took the advantage of the fact that the number of tokens in a hemistich is intuitively between four and ten, because of Ghazals’ metre rules. We thus decided that when full-space tokenization had less than four tokens, then both full-and half-spaces must be considered as separators. If the number of tokens obtained this way is more than four, the tokenization is forwarded to the next step. Otherwise, if there is still less than four tokens, the hemistich is marked for manual checking. The number of hemistichs that required manual fixation was very low, about 40 out of 340,000. 3.2 Normalization In Persian fonts, several letters have more than one form, because of different writing style related to different pronunciations; for instance âmrika: ایرمآ, emrika: ایرما (“America”); and of different characters encoding of Arabic letters; for instance anâr (“pomegranate”) might be written رانا or رانأ.","We get rid of these meaningless variations by normalizing the characters. This normalization has to come after basic tokenization because of the unreliable half-spaces, to be handled first, that interfere with the written form of some letters.","We first used both Arabic and Persian normalizers of Lucene5",": in the Persian version, most of the cases are considered except different alefs (first letter of Persian alphabet), which are properly handled by the Arabic normalizer. We furthermore added the following rules to Lucene modules: • Normalization for vâv and ye: There are two different forms of vâv: وor ؤ , which is rather Arabic, not preferred in Persian. For instance, word mo’men (“believer”) could be written نموم or نمؤم. We have a similar case with ye which might be written ـئ or ـي. For instance, âyine (“mirror”) might be written هنییآ or هنیئآ.","• Some characters exist which are optional in Persian writing for instance light vowels, tašdid (sign of emphasis: ّ in دمحم ), and tanvins, three signs could be attached at the end of some words, e.g. ً in ًاروضح . Some of them were implemented in Lucene Arabic normalizer, some in the Persian normalizer and some in none of them.","• Removal of the optional hamze sign ء at the end of word, for instance: ءلاما.","• Removal (without any change in the meaning) of some Arabic characters that do not normally appear in Persian but were present in the corpus, e.g. ٍ (tanvin kasre), ٌ (tanvin zamme). 5 http://lucene.apache.org/. 26","• Removal (without any change in the meaning) of adornment (calligraphy) characters, e.g. dashes, ْ (sokun), and ٓ (mad).","As explained in the former subsection, the final tokenization was postponed due to the difficult ambiguities introduced by half-/full-space confusions. To finalized it after character normalization, taking the advantage of our lexicon, we considered all bigrams, trigrams and 4-grams of tokens obtained and checked whether they correspond to a valid form in the lexicon. Out of 2,876,929 tokens, we had 330,644 (valid) bigrams, 12,973 trigrams and 386 4-grams. 3.3 Stemming/Lemmatization The purpose of stemming/lemmatization6","is to re-group (using the same writing) words of similar root, in order to reduce (hopefully the non-significant part of) the variability of the documents processed.","Although a free Persian stemmer PerStem exists (Jadidinejad et al., 2009)7",", its limitations we observed (see below) encouraged us to build our own stemmer.","Since Persian is an affixive language, lemmatization is achieved by removing plural signs, attached pronouns, prefixes and suffixes to obtain the root. We thus collected a list of these and enriched it using affixes provided by Adib Tousi (1974) and by Tabtabai (2007). Then we designed a flowchart to iteratively remove the unwanted parts from the normalized token until we get a simple word contained in the lexicon or a word with a length of less than 4 letters. The experiences showed us it is more appropriate to remove prefixes first, then suffixes. Even in suffix removal, the removal order is a crucial issue. Since some words have more than one suffix and the set of suffixes is not a prefix-free set, a wrong removal order can leads to removing a wrong suffix and might result in finishing the removal too early, where there still exist some letters to be removed. For instance, the word ناشیاهباتک (ketâbhâyešân, “their books”) should be reduced","6","Stemming reduces words to their stems, using rather crude algorithms and basic morphological rules, while lemmatization uses more advanced morphological analysis and lexical resources to find the root form, named lemma.","7","http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~jonsafari/ persian_nlp.html. to باتک (ketâb, “book”). It has three suffixes اه (hâ, plural marker), ی (ye, mediator) and ناش (šan, “their” as a attached pronoun). However, šan has two prefixes which are also suffixes: ن (N, infinitive mark) and نا (ân, plural mark for nouns). Such cases are not considered in PerStem, and the affixes removal is stopped too early. In order to overcome this problem in our stemmer, we generated all of the possible combinations of affixes and add them to our affixes collection. Then the largest possible one is removed from the token at each step.","We then checked for the term in the lexicon and return its lemmas when matched. If we could not find any matched term in the lexicon, we manually check the token. Doing so, we realized that because of the missing/wrong spaces, most of these tokens wrongly attached to conjunctions. For this specific purpose, we partially modified the list of affixes and applied the stemmer again on these out of vocabulary forms, ending up with the proper information.","In the case of homographs, for instance تسشن that could be read as nešasti (“you sat”) or as našosti (“you did not wash”), we pass all possible interpretations to the next processing step. For instance, the result of the lemmatization of تسشن is “’to sit’ or ’to wash’”, i.e. both lemmas. 3.4 Filtering In order to reduce even further the input variability, some filtering has been performed based both on frequencies and on a standard list of “stop-words”, some extremely common words which are normally meaningless (at least independently).","The general strategy for determining stop-words is to sort the terms by their frequencies in the collection, consider the most frequent ones and then filter them manually with respect to the domain. Doing so, we found stop-words well suited for the poem collection considered, which is slightly different from stop-words in normal Persian text (poem specific, and typographical error occurred in the corpus used). We also combined this set with a (manually chosen) subset of stop-words provided by K. Taghva (2003)."]},{"title":"4 Topic Modeling","paragraphs":["After preprocessing, we studied the correlations among words in Ghazals using “probabilistic topic 27","                  ","               Figure 2: Probabilistic distribution over the topics (learned in an unsupervised manner) for one specific couplet: the horizontal axis stands for the topics and the vertical axis for the probability of each topic for the couplet considered. Notice how only a few topics are used in the couplet. The most probable words for the five most probable topics for this couplet are also provided on the right. On top, an example of a possible assignment of these topics to the words in the couplet considered is provided. Each color represents one of the 5 most probable topics. models” (Buntine, 2002; Blei, 2012), more precisely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003)8",". We looked into correlation between topics and poets, as well as between topics and metres, and obtained very interesting results. 4.1 Model Probabilistic topic models are unsupervised generative models which represent documents as mixtures of topics, rather than (only) collections of terms (Blei, 2012). “Topics” are nothing else but probability distributions over the vocabulary that are learned in an unsupervised manner. Probabilistic topic models allow us to represent documents at a higher level (topics rather than words) with much fewer parameters. A typical example is given in Figure 2.","Taking advantage from conditional cooccurrences through topics, these models are able to take both polysemy and synonymy into account. To illustrate how such models behave, we could for instance consider the polysemic term","8","We used Mallet software, version 2.0.7; http://mallet. cs.umass.edu/. 0 500 1000 1500 20007.5 8 8.5 9 9.5 10 Number of iterations S c o r e 10.5 Figure 3: Learning score w.r.t number of iterations.

Two topics presented in Table 1 are showing different contexts that can include širin as a keyword. Topic 413 appeared to refer to contexts related to sweetness, whereas topic 337 appeared to refer to a famous Persian tragic romance, “Khosrow and Shirin”, a.k.a. “Shirin and Farhad”.","Furthermore, since ambiguity (homonymy) is a literature technique, sometimes poets use širin somewhere that can refer to both contexts. That could be the reason why رش (šekar, “sugar”), represented in green, appears in frequent terms of both topics.","One key issue using these kind of models regards the choice of the number of topics. To decide the appropriate number, we measured the model quality with held-out log-likelihood (estimated on validation set) using 1x10-fold cross validation (Wallach et al., 2009; Buntine, 2009).9","We ran each fold for 2000 iterations (convergence checked; see Figure 3) doing hyper-parameter optimization (Wallach et al., 2010) after 200 iterations. We observe that the log-likelihood decreases, and stabilizes around 400/500 topics (see Figure 4). We thus considered 500 topics to be a good order of magnitude for this corpus. 9","Note that the evaluation method implemented in Mallet is the biased method provided by Wallach (2009) and not the proper methods suggested by Buntine (2009). 28","Table 1: 10 Most probable terms chosen from three topics (among 500 topics).

To investigate this correlation further, the joined probability of topics and poets is measured and the results are shown in Figure 5. It can be observed that there is a strong correlation between poets and topics. Some general topics (used by all the poets) also appear (as vertical darker lines).","Another good illustration of this correlation is given in Figure 6 which illustrates the proportions of four different topics for the 30 poets ordered by their lifetime. Some relevant patterns can be observed. For instance, the topic related to “Joseph” (blue) and the one related to “Mirror” (violet) are correlated. In Persian literature, Joseph is the symbol of beauty and    Figure 5: Correlation between (automatically found) topics and poets: the joint probability P (topic, poet) is plotted in dark shades; the darker the shade, the higher the probability. The dark mark along the diagonal thus illustrates a very good correlation (conditional probability, in fact) between topics and poets.

X-axis shows the middle of lifetime of the poets. 29 beauty can be perceived by means of the mirror. This is the reason why these two topics are somehow cor-related. Moreover, the “Mirror” topic has an independent peak around 1700 A.D. This corresponds to Bidel Dehlave, so-called ”poet of mirrors” (Kadkani, 2007), who very often refers to mirrors in his poems.","Another pattern relates to drinking, which in Persian mystical literature refers to a grace from heaven. The main era of mystical literature is between 1300 and 1400 AD. As it can be observed from Figure 6, “Praying” and “Drinking” topics have similar curves in this time period, as expected. The independent peak corresponds to the poet Awhadi Maraghai who uses words related to drinking very much. 4.3 Correlation between Topics and Metre There is supposed to be a relation between the happiness or sadness of the words in a poem and its melody (metre). Vahidian Kamyar (Kamyar, 1985), for instance, provides a list of metres and their corresponded feeling.","We thus also wanted to investigated whether there was any correlation between the metres and the topics learned in an unsupervised manner. To answer this question, we encoded the 30 metres provided in the original corpus as a (new random) term each, and then added the corresponding “metre term” once to each couplet. Then a topic model has been estimated.","The results obtained confirmed Kamyar’s observations. For instance, the topics that have as probable term the “metre term” corresponding to the metre Kamyar associates to requiem, parting, pain, regret and complain (نتلاعف نتلاعف نتلاعف نلعف ) are presented in Table 2. As you can see all of the three topics presented are showing a kind of sadness."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["With this study, we show that we can fruitfully an-alyze Persian poems, both for modern and ancient Persian, using NLP tools.
