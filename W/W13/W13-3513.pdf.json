Specifically, while compositional models deal with the recursive nature of the language, providing a way to address its inherent ability to create infinite sentences from finite resources (words), they leave words as unexplained primitives whose meanings have somehow already been set before the compositional process. On the other hand, distributional models have been especially successful in providing concrete representations for the meaning of words as vectors in a vector space, created by taking into account the context in which each word appears. Despite its success for smaller language units, the distributional hypothesis does not naturally lend itself to compounds of words. Hence these models do not canonically scale in tasks requiring the creation of vector representations for text constituents larger than words, i.e. for phrases and sentences.","Given the complementary nature of those two semantic models, it is not surprising that consider-able research activity has been dedicated on combining them into a single framework that would benefit from the best of both worlds in a unified manner: Mitchell and Lapata (2008) experiment with intransitive sentences, applying simple compositional models based on vector addition and point-wise multiplication in a disambiguation task; Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Guevara (2010) use regression models in order to build vectors for adjective-noun compounds; Erk and Padó (2008) work on transitive sentences using structured vector spaces; Socher et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) use neural networks to combine vectors following the grammatical structure; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a,b) apply the categorical framework of Coecke et al. (2010) on the disambiguation task of Mitchell and Lapata (2008); and Kartsaklis et al. (2012) and Grefenstette et al. (2013) build upon previous implementations by adding specific algebraic operations and machine learning techniques to further improve the concrete abilities of the abstract categorical models.","A common strand in all of the above models is that they are based on “ambiguous” vector representations, where a polysemous word is represented by a single vector regardless of the number of its actual senses. For example, the word ‘bank’ has at least two meanings (financial institution and land alongside a river), both of which will be fused into a single vector representation. And, although it is generally true that compositional models following the formal semantics view of Montague do not care about disambiguation (meanings of words in such models are represented by logical constants explicitly set before the compositional process), the story changes when one moves to a vector space model with ambiguous vector representations. The main problem is that, when acting on ambiguous vector spaces, compositional models 114 seem to perform two tasks at the same time, composition and disambiguation, leaving the resulting vector hard to interpret: it is not clear if this vector is a proper meaning representation for the composed compound or just a disambiguated version of one of the words therein. This problem escapes the evaluation schemes, especially when disambiguation tasks are used as a criterion for evaluating compositional models—a common practice in current research for compositional-distributional semantics. Indeed, Pulman (2013) argues that although disambiguation can emerge as a welcome side-effect of the compositional process, it is not clear if compositionality is either a necessary or sufficient condition for disambiguation to happen. On the contrary, it seems that the form of most current vector space models and the compositional operations used on them (quite often some form of vector point-wise multiplication) mainly achieve disambiguation, but not composition.","The purpose of this paper is to further investigate the potential of a compositional-distributional model based on disambiguated vector representations, where each word can have one or more distinct senses. More specifically, we aim to show that (a) compositionality is not a necessary condition for disambiguation, so the quite common practice of using a disambiguation task as a criterion for evaluating the performance of compositional-distributional models is question-able; and (b) the introduction of a separate disambiguation step in the compositional process of distributional models can be indeed beneficial for the quality of the resulting composed vectors.","We train our models from BNC, a 100-million words corpus created from samples of written and spoken English. We perform word sense induction by following the generic algorithm of Schütze (1998), in which the senses of a word are represented by distinct clusters created by taking into account the various contexts in which this specific word occur in the corpus. For the actual clustering step we use a combination of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and the Caliński-Harabasz index (Caliński and Harabasz, 1974). The parameters of the models are fine-tuned on the noun set of SEMEVAL 2010 Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation task (Manandhar et al., 2010).","Equipped with a disambiguated vector space, we use it on a verb disambiguation experiment, similar in style to that of Mitchell and Lapata (2008), but applied on a more linguistically motivated dataset, based on the work of Pickering and Frisson (2001). We find that the application of a simple disambiguation algorithm, without any compositional steps, is proven more effective than a number of compositional models. We consider this as an indication for the necessity of separating disambiguation from composition, since it implies that the latter is not necessary for achiev-ing the former. Next, we demonstrate that a compositional model based on disambiguated vectors can indeed produce composite vector representations of better quality, by applying the model on a phrase similarity task (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010). The goal here is to evaluate the similarity of short verb phrases, based on the distance of their composite vectors."]},{"title":"2 Composition in distributional models","paragraphs":["The transition from word meaning to sentence meaning, a task easily done by human subjects based on the rules of grammar, implies the existence of a composition operation applied to primitive text units in order to build compound ones. Various solutions have been proposed with different levels of sophistication for this problem in the context of vector space models of meaning.","At one end of the spectrum the simple models of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) address composition as the point-wise multiplication or addition of the involved word vectors. This bag-of-words approach has been proven a hard-to-beat baseline for many of the more sophisticated models. At the other end, composition in the work of Socher et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) is served by the advanced machinery of recurring neural networks, where the output of the network is used again as input in a recurring fashion, for composing vectors of larger constituents. Following a different path, the categorical framework of Coecke et al. (2010) exploits a structural homomorphism between grammar and vector spaces in order to treat words with special meanings, such as verb and adjectives, as functions (tensors of rank-n) that apply to their arguments. This application has the form of inner product, generalising the familiar notion of matrix multiplication to tensors of higher rank.","Regardless of their level of sophistication, most of the models which aim to apply compositionality on word vector representations fail to address the problem of handling the polysemous nature of words. Even more importantly, many of the models are evaluated on their ability to disambiguate the meaning of specific words, following an idea first introduced by Kintsch (2001) and later adopted by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and others. For example, in this latter work the au-115 thors test their multiplicative and additive models as follows: given an ambiguous intransitive verb, say ‘run’ (with the two senses to be those of mov-ing fast and of a liquid dissolving), they examine to what extent the composition of the verb with an appropriate subject (e.g. ‘horse’ or ‘colour’) will disambiguate the intended sense of the verb within the specific context. Each row in the dataset consists of a subject (e.g. ‘horse’), a verb (‘run’), a high-similarity landmark verb (‘gallop’), and a low-similarity landmark verb (‘dissolve’). The subject is combined with the main verb to form a simple intransitive sentence, and the vector of this sentence is then compared with the vectors of the landmark verbs. The goal is to evaluate the degree to which the composed sentence vector is closer to the high landmark than to the vector of the low landmark, and this is considered an indication of successful composition.","However, although it is generally true that multiplying −−→run with −−−→","horse will filter out most of the components of −−→run that are irrelevant to ‘dissolve’ (since the ‘dissolve’-related elements of","−−−→","horse should have values close to zero) and will produce a disambiguated version of this verb under the context of ‘horse’, it is not at all clear if this vector will also constitute an appropriate representation for the meaning of the intransitive sentence ‘horse runs’. In other words, here we have two tasks taking place at the same time: (a) disambiguation of the ambiguous word given its context; and (b) composition that produces a meaning vector for the whole sentence. The extent to which the latter is a necessary condition for the former remains unclear, and constitutes a factor that complicates the evaluation and assessment of such systems. In this paper we argue that as long as the above distinct tasks are interwoven into a single step, claims of compositionality in distributional systems cannot be reliably assessed. We therefore propose the addition of a disambiguation step in the generic methodology of compositional-distributional models."]},{"title":"3 Related work","paragraphs":["Although in general word sense induction is a popular topic in the natural language processing literature, little has been done to address polysemy specifically in the context of compositional-distributional models of meaning. In fact, the only works relevant to ours we are aware of are that of Erk and Padó (2008) and Reddy et al. (2011). The structured vector space of Erk and Padó (2008) is designed to handle ambiguity in an implicit way, showing promising results on the Mitchell and Lapata (2008) task. The work of Reddy et al. (2011) is closer to our research: the authors evaluate two word sense disambiguation approaches on the noun-noun compound similarity task introduced by Mitchell and Lapata (2010), using simple multiplicative and additive models for composition. The reported results are also promising, where at least one of their models performs better than the current practice of using ambiguous vector representations.","Compared to both of the above works, the scope of the current paper is broader: it does not solely aim to demonstrate the positive effect of a “cleaner” vector space on the compositional process, but it also proceeds one step further and relates this issue with the current evaluation practice, showing that a number of verb disambiguation tasks that have been invariantly used for the assessment of compositional-distributional models might be in fact based on a wrong criterion."]},{"title":"4 Disambiguation scheme","paragraphs":["Our word sense induction method is based on the effective procedure first presented by Schütze (1998). For the ith occurrence of a target word wt in the corpus with context Ci = {w1, . . . , wn}, we calculate the centroid of the context as −→ci = 1 n (−→w1 + . . . + −→wn), where −→w is the lexical (or first order) vector of word w as it is created by the usual distributional practice (more details in Section 5). Then, we cluster these centroids in order to form a number of sense clusters. Each sense of the word is represented by the centroid of the corresponding cluster. Following Schütze, we will refer to these sense vectors as second-order vectors, in order to distinguish them from the lexical (first-order) vectors. So, in our model each word is represented by a tuple ⟨−→w , S⟩, where −→w is the 1st-order vector of the word and S the set of 2nd-order vectors created by the above procedure.","We are now able to disambiguate the sense of a target word wt given a context C by calculating a context vector −→c for C as above, and then comparing this with every 2nd-order vector of wt; the word is assigned to the sense that corresponds to the closest 2nd-order vector. That is,","−−→spref = arg min","−→","s ∈S d(−→s , −→c ) (1) where S is the set of 2nd-order vectors for wt and d(−→u , −→v ) the vector distance metric we use.","For the clustering step, we use an iterative bottom-up approach known as hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).

Compared to k-means clustering, this approach has the major advantage that it does not require us to define in advance a specific number of clusters. Compared to more advanced probabilistic techniques, such as Bayesian mixture models, it is much more straightforward and simple to implement, yet powerful enough to demonstrate the necessity of factoring out ambiguity from compositional-distributional models.","HAC is a bottom-up method of cluster analysis, starting with each data point (context vector in our case) forming its own cluster; then, in each iteration the two closest clusters are merged into a new cluster, until all points are finally merged under the same cluster. This process produces a dendrogram (i.e. a tree diagram), which essentially embeds every possible clustering of the dataset. As an example, Figure 1 shows a small dataset produced by three distinct Gaussian distributions, and the dendrogram derived by the above algorithm. Implementation-wise, the clustering part in this work is served by the efficient FASTCLUSTER library (Müllner, 2013). Choosing a number of senses In HAC, one still needs to decide where exactly to cut the tree in order to get the best possible partitioning of the data. Although the right answer to this problem might depend on many factors, we can safely assume that the optimal partitioning is the one that provides the most compact and maximally separated clusters. One way to measure the quality of a clustering based on this criterion is the Caliński/Harabasz index (Caliński and Harabasz, 1974), also known as variance ratio criterion (VRC). Given a set of N data points and a partitioning of k disjoint clusters, VRC is computed as follows: V RCk = trace(B) trace(W ) × N − k k − 1 (2)","Here, W and B are the intra-cluster and inter-cluster dispersion matrices, respectively: W = k ∑ i=1 Ni ∑ l=1","(−→xi (l) − x̄i)(−→xi (l) − x̄i)T (3) B = k ∑ i=1","Ni( x̄i − x̄)( x̄i − x̄)T (4) where Ni is the number of data points assigned to cluster i, −→xi (l) is the lth point assigned to this cluster, x̄i is the centroid of ith cluster (the mean), and x̄ is the data centroid of the overall dataset. Given the above formulas, the trace of B is the sum of inter-cluster variances, while the trace of W is the sum of intra-cluster variances. A good partitioning should have high values for B (which is an indication for well-separated clusters) and low values for W (an indication for compact clusters), so the higher the quality of the partitioning the greater the value of this ratio.","Compared to other criteria, VRC has been found to be one of the most effective approaches for clustering validity—see the comparative studies of Milligan and Cooper (1985) and Vendramin et al. (2009). Furthermore, it has been previously applied to word sense discrimination successfully, returning the best results among a number of other measures (Savova et al., 2006). For this work, we calculate VRC for a number of different partition-ings (ranged from 2 to 10 clusters), and we keep the partitioning that results in the highest VRC value as the optimal number of senses for the specific word. Note that since the HAC dendrogram already embeds all possible clusterings, the cutting of the tree in order to get a different partitioning is performed in constant time."]},{"title":"5 Experimental setting","paragraphs":["The choice of our 1st-order vector space is based on empirical tests, where we found out that a basis with elements of the form ⟨word, class⟩ presents the right balance for our purposes among simpler techniques, such as word-based spaces, and more complex ones, such as dependency-based approaches. In our vector space, each word has a distinct vector representation for every word class under which occurs in the corpus (e.g. ‘suit’ will have a noun vector and a verb vector). As our basis elements we use the 2000 most frequent content words in BNC, with weights being calculated as the ratio of the probability of the context word given the target word to the probability of the context word overall. The context here is a 5-word window on both sides of the target word.","The parameters of the clustering scheme are optimized on the noun set of SEMEVAL 2010 Word 117 Sense Induction & Disambiguation Task (Manandhar et al., 2010). Specifically, when using HAC one has to decide how to measure the distance between the clusters, which is the merging criterion applied in every iteration of the algorithm, as well as the measure between the data points, i.e. the individual vectors. Based on empirical tests we limit our options to two inter-cluster measures: complete-link and Ward’s methods. In the complete-link method the distance between two clusters X and Y is the distance between their two most remote elements:","D(X, Y ) = max x∈X,y∈Y d(x, y) (5)","In Ward’s method, two clusters are selected for merging if the new partitioning exhibits the minimum increase in the overall intra-cluster variance.

The metrics were chosen to represent progressively more relaxed forms of vector comparison, with the strictest form to be the euclidean distance and correlation as the most relaxed. For sense detection we use the disambiguation algorithm described in Section 4, considering as context the whole sentence in which a target word appears. The distance metric used for the disambiguation process in each model is identical to the metric used for the clustering process, so in the Ward/euclidean model the disambiguation is based on the euclidean distance, in complete-link/cosine model on the cosine distance, and so on.

Compare this, for example, with the best-performing system that achieved a V-measure of 0.21, a score that was largely due to the fact that the model assigned the unrealistic number of 11.54 senses per word on average (since V-measure tends to favour higher numbers of senses, as the baseline 1 cluster/instance shows in Table 1).1","Table 2 provides an example of the results, showing the senses for the noun ‘keyboard’ learnt by the best model of Ward’s method and correlation measure.

Versions of this task can be found, for example, in Mitchell and Lapata (2008), 1","The results of SEMEVAL 2010 can be found online at http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval2010_WSI/task_14 _ranking.html. 118 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 keyboard (single/cosine) (a) Single-link 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 keyboard (average/cosine) (b) Average-link 0 1 2 3 4 5 keyboard (ward/cosine) (c) Ward’s method 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 keyboard (complete/cosine) (d) Complete-link Figure 2: Dendrograms produced for word ‘keyboard’ according to 4 different linkage methods. Erk and Padó (2008), Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a,b), Kartsaklis et al. (2012) and Grefenstette et al. (2013). We briefly remind that the goal is to assess how well a compositional model can disambiguate the meaning of an ambiguous verb, given a specific context. This kind of evaluation involves two distinct tasks: the composition of sentence vectors, and the disambiguation of the verbs. And, although the evaluation of a model against human judgements provides some indication for the success of the latter task, it leaves unclear to what extent the former has been achieved. In this section we perform two experiments in order to address this question. The first of them aims to support the following argument: that although disambiguation can emerge as a side-effect of a compositional process, compositionality is not a necessary condition for this to happen. The second experiment is based on a more appropriate task that requires genuine compositional abilities, and demonstrates the good performance of a compositional model based on the disambiguated vector space of Section 5.","As our compositional method for the following tasks we use the multiplicative and additive models of Mitchell and Lapata (2008). Despite the simple nature of these models, there is a number of reasons that make them good candidates for demonstrating the main ideas of this paper. First, for better or worse “simple” does not necessarily mean “ineffective”. The comparative study of Blacoe and Lapata (2012) shows that for certain tasks these “baselines” perform equally well or even better than other more sophisticated models. And second, it is reasonable to expect that better compositional models would only work in favour of our arguments, and not the other way around. 6.1 Evaluating disambiguation One potential problem with the datasets used for the disambiguation task of Section 2, similar to the one of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a), is that ambiguous verbs are usually collected from a corpus based on some automated method. And, although they do exhibit variations in their senses (as most verbs do), in many cases these meanings are actually related—for example, the meanings of ‘write’ in G&S dataset are spell and publish. To overcome this problem, we used the work of Pickering and Frisson (2001), which provides a list of genuinely ambiguous verbs obtained from careful manual selection and ranking from human evaluators. The evaluators assessed the relatedness of each verb’s different meanings using a scale of 0 (totally unrelated) to 7 (highly related). From these verbs, we picked 10 with an average mark < 1. An example is ‘file’, which means ‘smooth’ in ‘file nails’ and ‘register’ as in ‘file an application’. For each verb we picked the 10 most occurring subjects and objects from the BNC (5 for each landmark). In the case of verb ‘file’, for example, among these were ‘woman’ and ‘nails’ for landmark ‘smooth’, and ‘union’ and ‘lawsuit’ for landmark ‘register’. Each subject and object was modified by its most occurring adjective in the corpus. This resulted in triples of sentences of the following form:","(1) main: young woman filed long nails high: young woman smoothed long nails low: young woman registered long nails","(2) main: monetary union filed civil lawsuit high: mon. union registered civil lawsuit low: mon. union smoothed civil lawsuit","The main sentence was paired with both high and low landmark sentences, creating a dataset2","of 200 sentence pairs (10 main verbs × 10 contexts × 2 landmarks)3",". These were randomly presented to 43 human annotators, whose duty was to judge the similarity between the sentences of each pair. The human scores were compared with scores produced by a number of models (Table 3).","The most successful model (M1) does not apply any form of composition. Instead, the comparison of a sentence with a “landmark” sentence is simply based on disambiguated versions of the 2","The dataset will be available at http://www.cs.ox. ac.uk/activities/compdistmeaning/. 3","As a comparison, the Mitchell and Lapata (2008) dataset consists of 15 main verbs × 4 contexts × 2 landmarks = 120 sentence pairs, while the Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) dataset has the same configuration and size with ours. 119 verbs alone. Specifically, the main verb and the landmark verb are disambiguated given the context (subjects, objects, and adjectives that modify them) according to Equation 1; this produces two 2nd-order vectors, one for the main verb and one for the landmark. The degree of similarity between the two sentences is then calculated by measuring the similarity between the two sense vectors of the verbs, without any compositional step. The score of 0.28 achieved by this model is impressive, given that the inter-annotator agreement (which serves as an upper-bound) is 0.38.","A number of interesting observations can be made based on the results of Table 3. First of all, the ‘verbs-only’ model outperforms the two baselines (which use composition but not disambiguation) by a large margin, and indeed also the other compositional models. This is an indication that this kind of disambiguation task might not be the best way to evaluate a compositional model. The fact that the most important condition for success is the proper disambiguation of the verb, means that the good performance of a compositional model demonstrates only this: how well the model is able to disambiguate an ambiguous verb. This is different from how well the composed representation reflects the meaning of the larger constituent; that is, it has very little to say about the extent to which an operation like −−−−−→woman⊙−−→","f ile⊙","−−−→","nails (⊙ denotes point-wise multiplication) results in a faithful representation of the meaning of sentence ‘woman filed nails’.","M2 to M5 represent different versions of the compositional models that use disambiguation in a distinct step. All these models compose both the main verb and the landmark with a given context, and then perform the comparison at sentence level. In M2 and M3 all words are first disambiguated prior to composition, while in M4 and M5 the 2nd-","Disambig.

The most impressive observation here is that the separation of disambiguation results in a tremendous improve-ment for the additive model, from 0.04 to 0.21. This is not surprising since, when using magnitude invariant measures between vectors (such as cosine distance), the resulting vector is nothing more than the average of the involved word vectors. The introduction of the disambiguation step before the composition, therefore, makes a great difference since it provides much more accurate starting points to be averaged.","On the other hand, the disambiguated version of multiplicative model (M2) presents inferior performance compared to the “ambiguous” version (B1). We argue that the reason behind this is that the two models perform different jobs: the result of B1 is a “mixing” of composition and disambiguation of the most ambiguous word (i.e. the verb), since this is the natural effect of the point-wise multiplication operation (see discussion in Section 2); on the other hand, M2 is designed to construct an appropriate composite meaning for the whole sentence. We will try to support this argument by the experiment of the next section. 6.2 A better test of compositionality Although there might not exists such a thing as the best evaluation method for compositional-distributional semantics, it is safe to assume that a phrase similarity task avoids many of the pitfalls of tasks such as the one of Section 6.1. Given pairs of short phrases, the goal is to assess the similarity of the phrases by constructing composite vectors for them and computing their distance. No as-sumptions about disambiguation abilities regard-ing a specific word (e.g. the verb) are made here; the only criterion is to what extent the composite vector representing the meaning of a phrase is similar or dissimilar to the vector of another phrase. From this perspective, this task seems the ideal choice for evaluating a model aiming to provide appropriate phrasal semantics. The scores given by the models are compared to those of human evaluators using Spearman’s ρ.","For this experiment, we use the “verb-object” part of the dataset presented in the work of Mitchell and Lapata (2010), which consists of 108 pairs of short verb phrases exhibiting three degrees of similarity.

However, the verb-object part serves the purposes of this paper much better, for two reasons.

Second, this part of the dataset allows us to do some meaningful comparisons with the task of Section 6.1, which is again around verb structures. The results are shown in Table 4.","This time, the disambiguation step provides solid benefits for both multiplicative (M2) and additive (M3) models, with differences that are statistically significant from the best baseline B1 (with p ≤ 0.07 and p ≤ 0.06, respectively). Note that the ‘verbs-only’ model (M1), which was by a large margin the most successful for the task of Section 6.1, now shows the worst performance. For comparison, the best result reported by Mitchell and Lapata (2010) on a 1st-order space similar to ours (regarding dimensions and weights) was 0.38 (“dilation” model)."]},{"title":"7 Discussion","paragraphs":["This paper is based on the observation that any compositional operation between two vectors is essentially a hybrid process consisting of two “components” that, depending on the form of the underlying vector space, can have different “magnitudes”. One of the components results in a certain amount of disambiguation for the most ambiguous original word, while the other one works towards a composite representation for the meaning of the whole phrase or sentence. The tasks of Section 6 are designed so that each one of them as-sesses a different aspect of this hybrid process: the task of Section 6.1 is focused on the disambiguation aspect, while the task of Section 6.2 addresses the compositionality part. One of our main arguments is the observation that, in order the get better compositional representations, it is essential to first eliminate (or at least reduce as much as possible the magnitude of) the disambiguation “component” that might show up as a by-product of the compositional process, so that the result is mainly a product of pure composition—this is what the “unambiguous” models do achieve in the task of Section 6.2. Based on the experimental work conducted in this paper, our first concluding remark is that the elimination of the ambiguity factor can be essential for the quality of the composed vectors.","But, if Table 4 provides a proof that the separation of disambiguation and composition can indeed produce better compositional representations, what is the meaning of the inferior performance of all “unambiguous” models (M2 to M5) compared to verbs-only version (M1) in the task of Section 6.1? Why disambiguation is not always effective (as in the case of multiplicative model) for that task? These are strong indications that the quality of composition is not crucial for disambiguation tasks of this sort, whose only achieve-ment is that they measure the disambiguation sideeffects generated by the compositional process. In other words, the practice of evaluating the quality of composition by using disambiguation tasks is problematic. As the topic of compositionality in distributional models of meaning increasingly gains popularity in the recent years, this second concluding remark is equally important since it can contribute towards better evaluation schemes of such models."]},{"title":"8 Future work","paragraphs":["A next step to take in the future is the application of these ideas on more complex spaces, such as those based on the categorical framework of Coecke et al. (2010). The challenge here is the effective generalization of a disambiguation scheme on tensors of rank greater than 1. Additionally, we would expect this method to benefit from more robust probabilistic clustering techniques. An appealing option is the use of a nonparametric method, such as a hierarchical Dirichlet process (Yao and Van Durme, 2011)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Daniel Müllner for his comments on the use of FASTCLUSTER library, as well as the three anonymous reviewers for their fruitful suggestions.
