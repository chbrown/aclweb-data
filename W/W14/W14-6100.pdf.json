SPMRL-SANCL is endorsed by the ACL SIGPARSE interest group and provides a forum for research in parsing morphologically-rich languages and non-canonical language, with the goal of identifying crosscutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology, in the face of more flexible word order and/or higher word-form variation, or lexical sparseness and ad-hoc structures than English newspaper text. SPMRL has also been host to discussions on realistic and appropriate evaluation methods that can be applied in the face of morphological and/or segmentation ambiguities; these discussions have culminated in the first shared task for parsing morphologically-rich languages, co-located with SPMRL 2013, and the second shared task for semi-supervised parsing of morphologically-rich languages, co-located with SPMRL 2014. The proceedings include nine contributions to the workshop as well as one system description from the shared task. The workshop included a keynote talk by Joakim Nivre (Uppsala). We would like to thank all submitting authors for their contributions, the program committee for their fine work on reviewing the submissions, the participants of the shared task for their contributions and of course our invited speaker. For their precious help preparing the SPMRL 2014 Shared Task and for allowing their data to be part of it, we warmly thank and the Linguistic Data Consortium, the Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew (MILA), the Ben Gurion University, Columbia University, Institute of Computer Science (Polish Academy of Sciences), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, University of the Basque Country, Uppsala University, University of Stuttgart, University of Szeged, University Paris Diderot (Paris 7), University of Marne La Vallée, and University of Tübingen. We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Språkbanken and the University of Gothenburg for providing the PAROLE corpus and the help of Dr. Jungyeul Park and Prof. Key-Sun Cho for the KAIST annotated news corpus. Finally, we would also like to thank the ACL SIGPARSE interest group for their endorsement, for the support of INRIA’s Alpage project, and everybody who participated in the workshop and contributed to the discussions.
