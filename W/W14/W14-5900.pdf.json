SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. We consider three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. Through this workshop, we anticipate to provide a platform for research outcome presentation and head-to-head discussion in the area of SocialNLP, with the hope to combine the insight and experience of prominent researchers from both NLP and social computing domains to contribute to the area of SocialNLP jointly. Also, selected and expanded versions of papers presented at SocialNLP will be published in two follow-on Special Issues of Springer Cognitive Computation (CogComp) and the International Journal of Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (IJCLCLP). The submissions to this year’s workshop were again of high quality and we had a competitive selection process. We received 18 submissions, and due to a rigorous review process, we only accepted 6 of them. Thus the acceptance rate was 33%. We also have 2 invited papers. The workshop papers cover a broad range of SocialNLP-related topics, such as aspect extraction, multi-lingual sentiment analysis, sentiment feature selection, online rating prediction, sentiment sequence recognition, automatic identification, verbal behavior and persuasiveness analysis, and user classification. We had a total of 18 reviewers. We warmly thank our PC members for the timely reviews and constructive comments. We are delighted to have Prof. Paolo Rosso, from Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, as our keynote speaker. We especially thank the Workshop Committee Chairs Dr. Jennifer Foster, Prof. Dan Gildea, and Prof. Tim Baldwin, and Local Co-Chair Dr. John Judge. We hope you enjoy the workshop!
