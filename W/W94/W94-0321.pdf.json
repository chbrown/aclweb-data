A system that provides interactive explanations and advice must be able to distinguish pertinent questions from questions that digress. It must also be able .to recognize questions that are incoherent. These types of questions require different treatment. Pertinent questions must be answered to achieve the discourse ~ phr~ ~ pose. If the user asks a digressive question, the sys-Â• tem may need to shift the focus of the discussion back ' to the original-purpose. Incoherent questions signal a more serious misunderstanding that requires clarifica-tion and repair. The Interactive Discourse Planner (IDP) is designed to plan text to describe and/or justify a domain plan interactively. As a testbed, IDP plans text to discuss driving routes. IDP uses questions from the user to recognize how to extend its own text plan in a way that both satisfies its listener and achieves the system's discourse goal. In the process of recognizing ways to expand its own text plan, IDP can detect three types of digressions that the user can initiate with a question. 1 Characterizing Digressions Grosz and Sidner define a digression as a type of :interruption [4]. An interruption is a discourse segment with a purpose that does not contribute to the achievement of the current discourse purpose. They describe three kinds. A true interruption has a discourse purpose that is unrelated to the interrupted discourse segment. For example, if a speaker says","\"John came by and dropped off the groceries Stop that","you kids. and I put them away after he left.\" the italized portion of text is a true interruption.","Speakers use a second type of interruption, the flashback or filling ~n missing places to bring objects and propositions into the discussion that aid in comprehension of the current discourse segment. This type of interruption provides back-ground knowledge. However, it does not contribute directly to the current discourse purpose. For example in","*I would like to thank my advisor, Stuart C. Shapiro, and the members of the SNePS Research Group in the Computer Science Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Their advice and comments are reflected in the research that this paper describes. \"OK. Now how do I say that Bill is Whoops I forgot about ABC. I need an individual concept for the company ABC... Now back to Bill. How do I say that Bill is an employee of ABC?\" the speaker sets aside her current purpose to discuss a pre-","Â•. requisite that should have been introduced earlier.","We are concerned with a third type of interruption that Grosz and Sidner describe as a digression. A digression con-","Â• tams a reference to some entity that is salient in both the interruption and the interrupted segment. The digression's PUrpose is not unrelated to the purpose of the interrupted segment (as in a true interruption), but neither is it a prerequisite (as in a flashback). As an example of a digression, Grosz and Sidner note that if while discussing Bill's role in company ABC, a conversational participant interrupts with","Speaking of Bill, that reminds me, he came to dinner","last week, Bill remains salient, but the discourse purpose changes.","In the IDP model, the system's purpose (or intent) is expressed by its discourse goal and the text plan that the system formulates and executes to try to achieve it. IDP detects a digression when the user asks a question about a discourse entity or a proposition that is part of the system's text plan, and the answer to the question cannot be ir/corporated into the text plan.","IDP Operates in a cooperative interactive mode in which the System is the primary speaker and the user is the primary listener. Henceforth, I refer to the user as the listener. In this interactive mode, IDP controls the discussion to make its own intentions clear and to try to achieve them. 2 Digression Types The first and simplest kind of digression that IDP can detect is when the listener asks a direct question about a proposition that was expressed by the system earlier in the discourse. The following interaction demonstrates this kind of digression and how the system responds to it. 1 i Â̧.","1All demonstrations given in courier font are actual interactions with IDP. 181 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994","Demonstration I:","L: Should I take Maple or Sheridan to go to the Eastern Hills Mall?","IDP: if now there was light traffic, you could take Sheridan however, now there is heavy traffic. you should take Maple. since taking Maple there are fewer businesses than taking Sheridan, taking Maple avoids heavy traffic.","L: Why is there heavy traffic now? *","IDP: since now is rush hour, as I was saying taking Maple avoids heavy traffic. As part of IDP's advice, it has expressed a proposition that lets the listener know circumstances that motivate the advice. In particular, IDP has told the listener that now there is heavy traf:fic. The system identifies the listener's question about this statement (marked with an as-terisk) as a digression from the discussion purpose. There-fore, after answering the question, IDP shifts the discussion back to its recommendation.","A second kind of digression that IDP can detect is when the listener questions a proposition that was never expressed, but that can be inferred from a proposition that has been presented. The following demonstration illustrates this digression type. ~he listener's line of questioning keeps referring to the last proposition that was expressed. This eventually leads to an explanation that does not address IDP's original purpose. The following interaction illustrates digressions of this kind.","Demonstration 3:","L: Should I take Maple or Sheridan to go to the Eastern Hills Mall7","IDP: take Maple.","L: Why7","IDP: taking Maple avoids heavy traffic.","L: Why?","IDP: taking Maple there are fewer businesses than taking Sheridan.","L: Why? *","IDP: since taking Maple is a newer route than taking Sheridan. anyways, taking Maple avoids heavy traffic. Unlike the first two questions, the listener's third why-question requires an answer that cannot be incorporated into the IDP's text plan, a plan for trying to convince the listener to use the Maple Road route. Therefore, the system detects a digression. 3 Related Work","Demonstration 2: L: Should I take Maple or Sheridan to go to","the Eastern Hills Mall7","IDP: take Maple. L: Why take Maple?","IDP: taking Maple avoids heavy traffic. L: Why?","IDP: since taking Maple there are fewer","businesses than taking Sheridan. L: Why is there heavy traffic now? *","IDP: since now is rush hour,","as I was saying taking Maple avoids","heavy traffic.","IDP uses its text plan to detect that the listener's third","question, unlike the listener's first two questions, initiates a","digression. This is notwithstanding the fact that the system","never expressed the proposition that the listener questions.","The listener's digressive question relies on an inference that","she made from the proposition that IDP conveyed in its","second response.","IDP does not analyze every question as a digression. Demonstration 2a:","L: Should I take Maple or Sheridan to go to","the Eastern Hills Mall?","IDP: take Maple.","L: Why is there heavy-traffic now? *","IDP Huh? In this example, IDP fails to make any coherent connection between the question and the text plan that they system has used so far. Note that the answer to this question does not fall outside the system's expertise. In Demonstration 2, IDP analyzed this question as a digression, and responded to it.","A third type of digression that the system detects is when Moore and Swartout note that prior to their work on the EES Text Planner, little work had been done on using a sYstem's goals and plans as a model of the discourse and its purpose [11, 12]. The EES Text Planner records its discourse goals and the plans that it formulates to achieve them in a"]},{"title":"dialogue history.","paragraphs":["When the user asks a follow-up question, the system uses the goal structure of its text plan, assumptions that have been made during generation, and alternative plans that it did not use to disambiguate the question and select a perspective for the answer to it.

Each text plan in the stack has a pointer to a goal (called the"]},{"title":"global contex 0","paragraphs":["that the text plan has been constructed to achieve. However, the stack ordering is the only relationship among the text plans and their respective goals. There is no representation of the overarching goal for the interaction nor how the plan for each exchange contributes to it. Therefore, the system cannot detect when the user's follow-up question results in planning for a discourse goal that does not contribute to the original discussion purpose.","The IDP model treats the system's text plan as a richer source of information. To produce answers to follow-up questions, IDP replans or expands a single text plan that has an overarching discourse goal. In this respect, IDP is similar to the Explanatory Discourse Generator (EDGE) [2]. EDGE plans tutorials by formulating a single text plan in advance and then executing it incrementally. EDGE uses feedback from the listener to monitor the success of its plan thereby making decisions to prune or extend parts of it that have not been used yet.","Planning text ahead is appropriate when a system plans tutorials. In this situation the system has a structure of 182 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 preset goals for the interaction. In contrast, IDP is designed for domains where there is no agenda for what the listener will come to know as a result of the interaction. IDP plans text to give advice and answer questions until the listener is satisfied. Therefore, like the EES Text Planner, IDP plans only in reaction to foll0w-up questions. However, to keep track of where the interaction is going, each plan that IDP constructs extends a single text plan that is formulated to achieve an overarching discourse goal. 4 Text Plan Operators 4.1 The Planning Formalism IDP's text plan operators (TP-operators) are based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [9] and are written using the SNePS Actor planning formalism [16].

IDP's DGs are unachieved system goals that have to do with the attitude or abilities of the listener toward a domain plan.

In this context, the appropriate measure of coherence is the degree to which a new TP-expansion contributes to the achievement of the system's goal. Discourse expecta-tion constrains IDP's choices to the growth points in the DTPs along the active path. An important heuristic in selecting a TP-expansion is the degree to which the proposed expansion highlights the system's intent as realized by the DTP-level portion of its TP. Therefore, IDP considers the growth points for the DTPs on the active path in the following order: 1. DTPs that replan a DTP 2. CTPs that expand a DTP IDP prefers DTPs that replan a DTP over CTPs that expand a DTP. This encodes a preference for plans that highlight the system's intent over plans that supply additional information.","In the first phase, IDP analyzes why-questions in relation to its own intent as represented by the DTPs along the active path. The Analyzer starts with the most recently executed DTP (the last DTP on the active path), and the localized unknowns associated with it. It tries to find another way to expand a DTP along the active path that lets the listener know a localized unknown. The Analyzer backs up the active path testing each DTP in turn. If this fails, in the second phase, the Analyzer considers augmenting the existing DTP at the informational level. This level is reflected in the CTPs. The Analyzer examines the most focussed DTP on the active path to see if it can he expanded with a CTP to let the user know a localized unknown.

The TP has been formulated to achieve the DG of having the listener adopt the plan to take Maple Road. The high-level plan is a DTP which can decompose into other DTPs and CTPs. The TP always bottoms out in the primitive act, say. The argument to the say act is a text message which includes a proposition as the content to be expressed.","In the TP, the checks (x/) mark the active path. Note that the plan for motivating the listener has not been executed in the order indicated by the sequencing act snsequence (see Figure 2(a))i In particular, to make the initial recommendation the planner selected a simple plan (advise, indicated by a dashed line) over a more complex plan (motivate). In response to the listener's first why-question, IDP replanned the recommendation with the more complex motivate act. Since its recorded TP indicated that it had just used the advise act, the only act in the plan for the motivate act that must be executed is the say act. This act conveys the satellite proposition ~that counts as the motivation for the advice.","The second act in the plan for motivate, circumstantiate expands to an optional CTP.

First, the Analyzer tests to see if the feedback has the correct form and content for one of three kinds of digressive questions that the system can detect. If one of the three tests succeeds, it will return a proposition that is the topic (topic) for the digression. The topic is the proposition that the listener questions in her digressive question.","In the second stage, if there is a topic, the Analyzer collects CTPs (ctps) that use the topic as a nuclear proposi-Figure 4: Detecting Digressive Questions from the Listener's Feedback IS-DIGRESSION-TYPE-1 (fb)","If fb = \"Why\" {\"not\" } proposition and DONE(system, say(proposition))","Then return(proposition)","Else return('nil) Figure 5: Test 1: For Detecting Digressive Questions Based on What the System Said Previously tion. It also collects domain reasoning that the system has performed that is related to the topic (related-reasoning). The Analyzer tests each CTP and removes any CTPs that have the effect of letting the listener know a proposition that she knows already. It also removes a CTP if its effect is not one of the related reasoning propositions. If there is still more than one candidate CTP, the Analyzer picks the simplest (ctp-to-expand). If a CTP has been found that meets all of the requirements, the Analyzer posts its effect as a CG and returns it for the Planner-Actor to expand to answer the question. If there is no such CTP, then the digression test fails. 6.1 Detecting Digressive Questions About","What has been Said The simplest kind of digression that IDP can detect is when the listener asks a direct question about a proposition that was expressed as part of the system's TP. The Analyzer uses the first digression test, IS-DIGRESSION-TYPE-I, that is described in Figure 5. If the feedback (fb) is a question in the form \"Why\" {\"not\"} proposition and the system has said the proposition as part of its TP, then the proposition is returned as the topic for the digression. Otherwise, the first test fails.","The first test is used to detect the digression in Demonstration i. Figure 6 gives IDP's TP just before the listener asks the digressive question in that example. When the listener asks Why is there heavy traffic now?, the Analyzer tries to find a way to expand the DTP-portion of its 185 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 TP on the active path (Section 5.3). This involves searching the growth points in the DTPs for motivate, concede, and recommend. When this fails, the Analyzer tries to process the feedback as a digressive question.","Testing for a digression (Figure 4) with the first digression rule (Figure 5), the Analyzer checks the TP in Figure 6 to see if the proposition in the listener's question was said by the system. The Analyzer finds that it has been said (Figure 6 in boldface). Therefore, the first digression test succeeds, and the following proposition is returned as the topic of the digression:","OBJ-PROP(now, heavy-traffic) The Analyzer finds another CTP that uses the topic as a nucleus:","circumstantiate(OBJ-PROP(now, heavy-traffic)) and collects reasoning that is related to the topic","ACT-PLAN(avoid(heavy-traffic), *Maple-plan)","OBJ-PROP(now, rush-hour))","SECO N DARY-GOAL-ACT(avoid(heavy-traffic)) The CTP's effect,","KNOW(listener,","OBJ-PROP(now, rush hour)) lets the listener know a new satellite proposition: now is rush hour. Since (he listener model does not assert that the listener knows this proposition, and since this proposition is related by domain reasoning to the topic, the CTP remains as a candidate for expansion. So that IDP's Planner-Actor can instantiate a plan for this CTP, its effect is made a CG. Then the CTP is returned for the Planner-Actor to expand into the TP. This leads to the restatement found in the last line of IDP's response in Demonstration 1. 6.2 Detecting Digressive Questions About","Inferred Propositions In Demonstration 2, IDP never expressed the proposition that the listener questions. Therefore, the listener must have inferred it. In this case, the system cannot determine that the question is digressive simply because the answer is something that the listener does not know. Such a rule would not distinguish digressive questions from incoherent ones.","To test for digressive questions about propositions that the listener has inferred, the Analyzer uses the second test, IS-DIGRESSION-TYPE-2, that is described in Figure 7. The Analyzer checks to see if the feedback is a why-question about a proposition (proposition) that has not been expressed by the system, but that can be inferred (IS-INFERABLE) from what has been said. If the proposition satisfies these requirements, then, as in the previous case, the proposition is returned as the topic for the digression. Otherwise, the second test fails.","A question is coherent only if the listener has inferred it correctly from something that the system has said. Figure 8 describes the test, IS-INFERABLE, that the Analyzer uses to determine if the questioned proposition is inferable. First, the Analyzer gathers all the propositions that IDP has said as the content of a say act (expressed-props). For each expressed proposition (prop), the Analyzer collects propositions that are within two reasoning steps of IS-DIGRESSION-TYPE-2(fb) fb = \"Why\" {\"not\"}"]},{"title":"proposition","paragraphs":["and not(DONE(system, say(proposition))) and IS-INFERABLE(proposition)","Then return(proposition)","Else return('nil) Figure 7: Test 2: For Detecting Digressive Questions that the Listener has Inferred IS- INFEI~AB LE(proposition)","Let expressed-props := get-said-props","Loop-for-each prop in expressed-props Let inferable-props:=","union(get-reasoning(2, expressed-props), inferable-pr0ps)","Endlo0p","Let inferable-props :=","remove(expressed-props, inferable-props)","If member(propositlon, inferable-props) Then return('true) Else return('nil) Figure 8: Determining if a Proposition is Inferable each expressed proposition.

Therefore, after collecting the inferable propositions, the Analyzer removes any proposition that is also one of the expressed propositions. FinMly, the Analyzer checks to see if the proposition that the listener has questioned is among those that are unsaid, but inferable, from what IDP has said previously. If it is, the test succeeds.","In Demonstration 2, the second digression test is used to help determine that the listener's question is digressive.

Therefore, analyzing the question to recognize a way to extend IDP's TP fails.","Next, the Analyzer attempts to process the question as a digression (Section 6). IDP answered this question in Demonstrations 1 and 2. In Demonstration 2a, the questioned proposition has not been expressed previously. Therefore, the first digression test fails immediately. The third digression test also fails because the question is not a simple why-question. In the second digression test, the utterance satisfies the first two conjuncts. That is, it has the correct form, and it has not been expressed by the system. However, it is not inferable from what has been said so far. At the point in the discourse where the question is asked, the only proposition that IDP has expressed is","DO(listener, *Maple-plan) Since this proposition is not a true fact in the knowledge base, no propositions are inferable from it. Therefore, the Analyzer determines that the questioned proposition is not a digression. Having failed all the tests, IDP responds with Huh?.","Note that in Demonstration 2a, the proposition that the listener questions","OBJ-PROP(now, heavy-traffic) and the answer to it","OBJ-PROP(now, rush-hour) are among the localized unknowns (Section 5.1) that can be associated with the TP at the point in the discourse where the question is asked. This means that the information that the listener refers to with her question is highly relevant domain information. In spite of this, the question is incoherent. This suggests that discourse focus and purpose are more important factors for determining the coherency of a question than the domain structure. 7 The System Implementation In the knowledge base, the several sources of information that the system needs to analyze and plan the discourse are all represented uniformly using the Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS) [17]. This includes knowledge of the text plan operators, the domain plans, entities in the domain, the user model, the discourse plan executed so far, and rules for reasoning about all of the above. The SNePS Actor models a cognitive agent operating in a single-agent world. It integrates inference and acting by representing beliefs, plans, and acts as structured intensional entities in the network formalism. Because the agent's world and planning knowledge is represented uniformly, the agent can discuss, reason about, formulate, and also execute its plans.","Based on the TOUR model [8], the various driving routes that my system can discuss are represented as preconstructed plans that are composed of two types of actions: going and turning. The domain plans are represented at various levels of detail and, as conceptual entities, can have properties. Whenever the system reasons about the domain, the reasoning that leads to deductions is recorded in the knowledge base along with the deductions themselves and is available as content for explanatiol,s.","References","[1] s.
