In these languages, word order variation is used to convey distinctions in meaning that are not generally captured in the semantic representations that have been developed for English, although these distinctions are also present-in somewhat less obvious ways in English. In the next section, I present a summary of the linguistic data on Turkish word order variations. Section 3 describes the categorial formalism I propose to model the syntax, semantics, and pragmatic information in Turkish sentences. To capture the syntax of free word order languages, I present an adaptation of Combinatory Categorial Grammars, CCGs (Steedman-85; Steedman-91), called {}-CCGs (set-CCGs). Then, I integrate a level of information structure, representing pragmatic functions such as topic and focus, with {}-CCGs to allow pragmatic distinctions in meaning to influence the word order of the sentence in a compositional way. In Section 4, I discuss how this strategy is used within a generation system which produces Turkish sentences with word orders appropriate to the context, and include sample runs of the implementation."]},{"title":"2 Free Word Order in Turkish","paragraphs":["The most common word order used in simple transitive sentences in Turkish is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), but all six permutations of a transitive sentence can be used in the proper discourse situation since the subject and object are differentiated by case-marking. 1","*I would like to thank Mark Steed.man and the anonymous referees for their valuable advice.

Often intonational phrase boundaries do not correspond to traditional phrase structure boundaries. However, by using the CCG type-raising and composition rules, CCG formalisms can produce nontraditional syntactic constituents which may match the intonational phrasing. These intonational phrases often correspond to a unit of planning or presentation with a single discourse function, much like the information structure components of topic, neutral, focus, and background in Turkish sentences. Thus, the ambiguity that CCG rules produce is not spurious, but in fact, necessary to capture prosodic and pragmatic phrasing. The surface structure of a sentence in CCGs can directly reflect its information structure, so that different derivations of the same sentence correspond to different information structures.","In the previous section, we saw that ordering of constituents in Turkish sentences is dependent on pragmatic functions, the information structure of the sentence, rather than on the argument structure of the sentence as in English. Moreover, information structure is distinct from argument structure in that adjuncts and elements from embedded clauses can serve a pragmatic function in the matrix sentence and thus be a component of the information structure without taking part in the argument structure of the matrix sentence. This suggests an approach where the ordering information which is dependent on the information structure is separated from the the argument structure of the sentence. In section 3.1, I describe a version of CCGs adapted for free word order languages in (Hoffman-92) to capture the argument structure of Turkish, while producing a flexible surface structure and word order. In addition, each CCG constituent is associated with a pragmatic counterpart, described in section 3.2, that contains the context-dependent word order restrictions. 3.1"]},{"title":"{}-CCG","paragraphs":["Multi-set Combinatory Categorial Grammars, {}-CCGs, (Hoffman-92) is a version of CCGs for free word order languages in which the subcategorization information associated with each verb does not specify the order of the arguments.

For instance, a transitive verb has the following category Sl{Nn , Na} which defines a function looking for a set of arguments, nominative case noun phrase (Nn) and an accusative case noun phrase (Na), and resulting in the category S, a complete sentence, once it has found these arguments. Some phrase structure information is lost by representing a verb as a function with a set of arguments. However, this category is also associated with a semantic interpretation. For instance, the verb \"see\" could have the following category where the hierarchical information among the arguments is expressed within the semantic interpretation separated from the syntactic representation by a colon: S : see(X,Y)]{Nrt : X, Na : Y}.

All Turkish verbs are assigned the ordering category seen in the orderfeature in Figure 1; this is a function which can use the categorial application rules to first combine with a focused constituent on its left, then a neutral constituent on its left, then a topic constituent on its left, and then a background constituent on its right, finally resulting in a complete utterance. This function represents the template mentioned in example 2 for assigning discourse functions according to their positional relation to the verb following (Erguvanli-84). However, it is more flexible than Erguvanh's approach in that it allows more than one possible information structure. The parentheses around the arguments of the ordering category indicate that they are optional arguments. The sentence may contain all or some or none of these information structure components. It may turn out that we need to restrict the optionality on these components. For instance, if there is no topic found in the sentence-initial position, then we may need to infer a topic or a link to the previous context. In the current implementation, the focus is an obligatory constituent in order to ensure that the parser produces the derivation with the most likely information structure first, and there is an additional ordering category possible where the verb itself is focused and where there are no pre-verbal elements in the sentence.","Categories other than verbs, such as nouns, determiners, adjectives, and adverbs, are associated with an ordering category that is just a basic element, not a function. In Turkish, the familiarity status of entities in the discourse model serves a role in determining their discourse function. For example, discourse-new entities cannot occur in the post-verbal or sentence initial positions in Turkish sentences. Thus, discourse-new elements can be assigned ordering categories with the feature-attribute focus or neutral with their semantic properties as the feature-value, but they cannot be associated with background or ¢opic ordering categories. There are no such restrictions for discourse-old entities; thus they can be assigned a variable which can unify with any of the information structure components.","During a derivation in parsing or generation, two constituents can combine only if the categories in their category features can combine using the {}-CCG rules presented in the previous section, and the categories in their order features can combine using the following rewriting rules.

A lexical entry roughly matches the input if its semantic key-predicate is a member of the list of semantic properties given in the input. After a rough match using term-unification, find-lex-cat unifies the DAGs containing all of the known syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information for the most embedded result of the lexical category and the result of the input, e.g. Figure 4, to find the lexical","8Note that order and concat-phons must be called after we have lexically instantiated both Arg and LexDag to avoid infinite loops.

In addition, a separate algorithm, perhaps Centering Theory (Grosz/etal-83), is needed to keep track of the salience of discourse entities and resolve the reference of empty pronouns, or in the case of generation, to determine what must be realized and what can be dropped in the utterance. In future research, I would also like to extend this same approach to generate certain stylistic constructions in English such as topicalization, it-clefts, and right dislocation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.
