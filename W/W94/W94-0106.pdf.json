We identify four different types of slufllow linguistic knowledge that are applicable to this system, and we quantify the performance gained by incorporating each such knowledge module, We perform experiments for different corpus sizes and different inputs (sets of adjectives to group), collect clam on the usaful.ness of each linguistic module, assess the statistical significance of the results, and compare the contributions of the linguistic knowledge sources against each other. We also assess the overall effect linguistic knowledge has in our system. Our results show that linguistic knowledge causes a significant increase in the performance of the system. We conclude by discussing how these positive restdts can be generalized to other problems in statistical NLP. 1. INTRODUCTION","The idea of integrating statistical and knowledge-based approaches for natural language problems, has been. recently. . gainin$ ground, in. the computational lingmsucs commumty, as it is expected that a combined approach will offer significantly better performance over either methodology alone. This paper supplements this intuitive belief with actual evaluatzon data, obtained when several linguistics-based modules were integrated in a statistical system.","We used a system we previously developed for the separation of adjectives into semantic groups [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993] as the basis for our comparative analysis. We identified several different types of shallow linguistic knowledge that can be efficiently introduced into our system. We evaluated the system with and 43 without each such feature, obtaining an estimate of each feature's positive or negative contribution to the overall performance. By matching cases where all system parameters are the same except for one teature, we assess the statistical significance of the differences found. Also, a statistical model of the system's performance in terms of the active features for each run offers a view of the contributions of features from a different angle, contrasting the significance of linguistic features (or other modeled system parameters) against each other.","Our analysis of the experimental results showed that many forms of li%.uistic knowledge have a significant positive conmbution to the performance of the system. We attribute to the combined effect of the linguistic knowledge modules the ability of our system to perform fine-tuned classification of adjectives into semantic classes. Other statistical systems that address word classification probleans do not emphasize the use of linguistic knowledge and do not deal with a specific word class[Brown et al., 1992], or do not exploit as much linguistic knowledge as we do [Pereira et al., 1993]. As a result, a coarser classification is usually produced. In contrast, by limiting the system's input to adjectives, we can take advantage of specific syntactic relationships and additional faltering procedures that apply only to ,particular word classes. These sources of lingmstic knowledge provide in turn the extra eedgc for discriminating among the adjectives at the semantic level.","Our\" adjective grouping system can be used for applications such as natural lansuage generation (where knowledge of the semanuc groups and of the ordering of the elements within them allows the precise lexiealization of semantic concepts [Elhadad, 1991]) and computational lexicography (by automatically eompifing domain-dependent lists of synonyms and antonyms). The produced groups can also help correct erroneous usage of multiple qualifiers that are superfluc~ts or contradict each other, a phenomenon that has been observed in medical reports 1. But in addition to the immediate applications of word classification, many other sfatistical NLP applications can be cast in a similar framework. Therefore, the positive effects of linguistic knowledge on our system indicate that the incorpo/'ation of linguistic knowledge will probably result in similar b~efits for other applications as well.","In what follows, we briefly review our adjective grouping system, and then present the !ingui.'s - tic features we explored and the alternatives tor each of them. In Section 5 we give the results of our evaluation on different combinations of features and we analyze their significance. We also ~rresent these results in a predictor-response","amework, and we conclude by discussing the applicability of our results to other NLP problems.","2. AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADJECTIVE GROUPING SYSTEM","Our adjective grouping system [Hatzivassilogiou and McKeown, 1993] starts with a set of adjectives to be clustered into semantically related groups. Ideally, we want highly related words such as synonyms, antonyms, and hyponyms to be the only ones placed in the same group. The system is given ~e number of groups to form as an input parameter 2, and has access to a text corpus. No semantic information about the adjectives is available to the system. The system operates by extracting pairs of modified nouns for each adjective, and, optionally, pairs of adjectives that we can expect to be semantically uurelated on linguistic grounds 3. From the estimated distribution of modified nouns for each adjective, a similarity sccxe is assigned to each possible pair of adjectives. This is based on KendaLl's x, a nonparametric, robust estimator of correlation [Kendall, 193811 Using the similarity scores and, optionally, the established relationships of nonrelatedness, a non-hierarchical clustermg method [Spath, 1985] assigns the adjectives to groups in a way that maximizes the within-group similarity (and therefore also maximizes the between-group dissimilarity).","IWe thank Johanna Moore for pointing out this application to us.","2Determining this number from the data is probably the hardest problem in cluster analysis in general; see [Kaufman and Rousseeuw. 1990].","J~hese are adjectives that either modify the same noun in the same NP (e.g. big white house) or one of them modifies the other (e.g. light blue coat); see [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown. 1993] for a detailed analysis. 44 1. deadly fatal 2. capitalist socialist Â• 3. clean dirty dumb 4. hazardous toxic 5. insufficient scant 6. generous outrageous unreasonable 7. endless protracted &plain 9. hostile unfi~endly I0. delicate fragile unstable 1 I. affluent impoverished prosperous 12. brilliant clever energetic smart stupid 13. communist leftist 14. astonishing meager vigorous 15. catastrophic disasm3ns harmful 16. dry exotic wet 17. chaotic turbulent 18. confusing misleading 19. dismal gloomy 20. dual multiple pleasant 21. fat slim 22. affordable inexpensive 23. abrupt gradual stunning 24. flexible lenient rigid strict stringent","Figure 1: Example clustering found by the system using all linguistic modules.","To evaluate our system, we have developed extended versions of the standard information retrieval measures precision, recell, and fallout. These extended versions score the grouping produced .by the system against a set of model groupings (mstead of just one) for the same adjecfives, supplied by humans. In the experiments reported m this paper, we employ 8 or 9 human-constructed models for each adjective set. We base our comparisons on and report the F-measure scores [Van Rijsbergen, 1979] which combine precision and recall in a single number. In addition, since the correct number of groupings is something that the system cannot yet determine (and, incidentally, something that human evaluators disagree abou0, we run the system for the five ceases m the range -2 to +2 around the average number of clusters employed by the humans and average the results. This smoothing operation prevents an accidental hilgh or low score being reported when a small variauon in the number of clusters produces very different scores.","It should be noted here that the scores reported should not be interpreted as linear percentages. In other words, a score of 40 is not just twice as good as a score of 20, and going from 30 to 40 is much harder than goin$ from 20to 30. The latter is true for most applicanons, but the problem of interpret-ing the scores is exacerbated in our context because of the structural constraints imposed by the clustering and the presence of multiple models. Furthermore, even the best clustering that could be produced would not receive a score of 100, because of disagreement among humans on what is the correct answer. To el,~ the meaning of the scores, we accompany them with lower and _upper bounds for each adjective set we examine. These bounds are obtained by the performance of a system that creates random groupings (averaged over many runs) and by the average score of the human-produced partitions when evaluated against the other human models respectively.","Figure 1 shows an example clustering produced by our system for one of the adjective sets analyzed in this paper.","3. THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES BEING TESTED","We have identified several sources of linguistic knowledge that can be incorporated in our system, augmenting the statistical component. Each such source represents a parameter of the system, i.e. a Ieature that can be present or absent or more generally take a value from a predefined set. We selected features that can be effficienfly computed in a completely automatic way for unrestricted text and do not require extensive amounts of knowledge to be available to the system. Almost all of these features can be ~generalized to other applications as well, as we discuss in Section 6. In this section we discuss first one of these parameters that can take several values, namely the method of extracting data from the corpus, and then several other bina~-valued features."]},{"title":"45 3.1 Extracting data from the corpus","paragraphs":["Our adjective clustering system determines the distribution of related (modified) nouns for each adjective and eventuaUy the similarity between adjectives from pairs of the form (adjective. modified noun)observed in the corpus. Direct information about incompatible adjectives (in the form of appropriate adjective-adjective pairs) cart ~lso be collected from the corpus. Therefore, a tWst parameter of the st, stem and a possible dimen-sion for comparisons ts the method employed to identify such pairs in free text. This is hardly a unigue feature of our system: all word-based statistical systems must fwst collect data from the corpus about the words of interest, on which the subsequent statistics operate 4 .","There are several alternate models for this task of data collection, with different degees of linguistic sophistication. A first model Is to use no linguistic knowledge at all: we collect for each adjective of interest all words that fall within a window of some predetermined size. Naturally. no negative data (adjective-adjective pairs) can be collected with this method. However, the method can be implemented easily and does not require the identification of any linguistic constraints so it is completely general. It has been used for diverse problems such as machine translation and sense disambiguation [Gale et al., 1992, Schiltze, 1992].","A second model is to restrict the words collected to the same sentence as the adjective of interest and to word elass(es) that we expect on linguistic grounds to be relevant to adjectives. For our application, we collect all nouns in the vicinity of an adjective without leaving the current sentence. We assume that these nouns have some relationship with the adjective and that semantically different adjectives will exhibit different collections of such nouns. This model requires only part-of-speech information (to identify nouns) and a method of detecting sentence boundaries. It uses a window of fixed length to define the neighborhood of each adjective. Such a model incorporates minimal linguistic knowledge. namely in determining what constitutes the informative class(es) of words collected (nouns in our problem). Again, negative knowledge such as incompatible adjective pairs cannot be collected with this model. Nevertheless, it has also been widely used, e.g. for collocation extraction [Sm~ja, 1993] and sense disambiguation [Liddy and Park, 1992].","A third model uses a simple linguistic rule to identify pairs of interest that is even more restrictive and informative than the \"nouns in vicinity\"","4Although frequently details of the statistical model employed receive more consideration. approach. Since we are interested in .nouns modified by adjectives, such a rule is to correct a noun immediately following an adjective, assum-ing that this implies a modification relationship. Pairs of consecutive adjectives Can also be collected.","Up to this point we have successively restricted the collected pairs on linguistic grounds, so that less but cleaner data is collected. For the","fourth model, we extend the simple rule given above, using linguistic information to catch more valid pairs without sacrificing accuracy. We employ a pattern matcher that retrieves any sequence of one or more adjectives followed by any sequence of zero or more nouns. These sequences are then analyzed with heuristics based on linguistics to obtain pairs. For example, it can be shown that all adjectives in such a sequence must be semantically unrelated, and that it is best to attach all the adjectives to the final noun.","The regular expression and pattern matching rules of the previous model can be extended further, forming a grammar for the constructs of interest. This approach can detect more pairs, and at the same time address known problematic cases not detected by the previous models.","We imp.lemented the above five data extraction models, using typical window sizes for the first two methods (50 and 5 on each side of the window respectively) which have been found useful in other problems before. For the fifth model, we developed a finite-state grammar for NPs which is able to handle both predicative and attributive modification of nouns, conjunctions of adjectives, adverbial modification of adjectives, quantifiers, and apposition of adjectives to nouns or other adjectives 5. Unfortunately, the resources required to perform our tests for the first model were too great (e.g. 12,287,320 pairs in a 151 MB file were extracted for the 21 adjectives in our smallest test set) so we dropped that model from further consideration and we use the second model as the baseline of minimal linguistic knowledge. Other researchers have also reported similar problems of excessive resource demands with the \"collect all neighbors\" model [Gale et al., 1992]. 3.2 Other linguistic features","In addition to the data extraction method, we identified three other areas where linguistic knowledge can be introduced in our system. F'trst, we can employ morphology to convert plural","5For efficiency reasons we did not consider a more powerful formalism. antitrust new big old economic political financial potential foreign real global serious international severe legal staggering little technical major unexpected mechanical Figure 2: Test set 1; from an earlier corpus. nouns to the corresponding singular ones and adjectives in comparative or superlative degree to their base form. Almost all adjectives and nouns that appear in multiple forms have no semantic difference from their base form except for the number or deg'e e feature. This conversion combines counts of similar pairs, thus raising the expected and estimated fr~,quencies of each pair in any statistical model.

We solve this"]},{"title":"problem ~ counting","paragraphs":["me occurrences of each candidate form in our corpus and selecting the one with non-zero frequency.","Another potential application of linguistic knowledge is the use of it spell-checking procedure, combined with a word list, to eliminate typographical errors from the corpus. Such en'ors can produce wrong estimates for the frequencies of modified nouns for an adjective, but most important!y introduce \"unique\" nouns appea~'ing only with one adjective, skewing the comparison of noun distributions. We implemented this component using the Unix spell program and associated word list, with extensions for hyphenated compounds. Uni~ortm~tedy, since a fixed and domgiu independent lemcon is used for this process, some valid but overspecialized words may be discarded too.","Finally, we can use additional sources of knowledge which supplement the primary similarity relationships and are justified on linguistic grounds. We identified several potential sources of additional knowledge that can be extracted from the corpus (e.g. conjunctions of adjectives). In this comparison study we implemented and consider the significance of one of these knowledge sources, r~medy the negative examples offered by adjective-adjective pairs. 46"]},{"title":"4. THE COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS","paragraphs":["In the previous section we identified four parameters of the system, the effects of which we want to analyze. But in addition to these parameters that can be directly varied and have predetermined possible values, several other variables can affect the performance of the system.","First, the performance of the system depends naturally on the adjective set that is to be clustered. Presumably variations in the adjective set can be modeled by several parameters, such as size of the set, number of semantic groups in it, and strength of semantic relatedness among its members, plus several parameters describing the properties of the adjectives in the set in isolation, such as frequency, specificity, etc.","A second variable that affects the clustering is the corpus that is used as the main knowledge source, through the observed cooeeurrence patterns. Again the effects of different corpora can be separatecl into several factors, e.g. the size of the corpus, its generality, the genre of the texts, etc.","Since in this paper we are interested in quantifying the effect of the linguistic knowlcdse in our system, or more precisely of the linguistic knowledge that we can explicitly control through the four parameters discussed above, we did not attempt to model in detail the various factors entering the system as a result of the choice of adannual negative big net chief new commercial next current old daily past different positive difficult possible easy pre-tax final previous future private hard public high quarterly important recent initial regional international senior"]},{"title":"likely","paragraphs":["significant local similar low small military strong modest weak national Figure 3: Test set 2; high frequency words. .~ective set and"]},{"title":"corpus.","paragraphs":["However, we are interested in measuring the effects of the linguistic parameters in a wide range of contexts, and m correlating these effects with variables originating from the choice of corpus and adjective set.

GENERALIZING TO OTHER APPLICATIONS","In the previous section, we showed that the introduction of linguistic knowledge in our system produces a performance difference, which is not only statistically observable but also quantitatively significant (cf. Table 4). We believe that these positive results should also apply to other corpus-based NLP systems that employ statistical methods. Many of the linguistic components of our system, including the extraction model that was shown to be the most important linguistic parameter, are not specific to the word grouping problem. They can thus be directly incorporated in systems designed for other problems but essentially following the same basic architecture as ours.","Many statistical approaches share the same basic methodology with our system: a set of words is preselected, related words are identified in a corpus, the frequencies of words and of pairs of related words are estimated, and a statistical model is used to make predictions for the original words. Across appfications, there are differences in what words are selected, how related words are defined, and what kind of predictions is made. Neverthe-less, the basic components stay the same. For example, in our appfication the original words are 1. catastrophic harmful 2. dry wet 3. lenient rigid strict stringent 4. communist leftist 5. flexible hostile protracted unfriendly","6. abrupt chaotic disastrous gradual turbulent vigorous","7. affluent affordable inexpensive prosperous 8. outrageous 9. capitalist socialist lO. dismal gloomy pleasant","11. generous insufficient meager scant slim 12. delicate fragile 13. brilliant energetic 14. dual multiple stupid","15. hazardous toxic unreasonable unstable 16. plain 17. confusing 18. clever 19. endless 20. clean dirty impoverished 21. deadly fatal 22. astonishing misleading stunning Â• 23. dumb fat smart 24. exotic","Figure 5: Example clustering found by the system using no linguistic modules. the adjectives and the predictions are their groups: in machine translation, the predictions are the translations of the words in the source languag~ text; in sense disambiguation, the predictions are the senses assigned to the words of interest; in part-of-speech tagging or in classification the predictions are the t,~s or classes assigned to each word. Because of this underlying similarity, the comparative analysis presented m the paper is relevant to all these problems.","For a concrete example, we examine the case of collocation extraction that has been addressed with statistical methods in the past. Smadja [1993] describes a system that imtially uses the \"nouns in vicinity\" extraction model to collect cooccurrence information about words, and then identifies collocations on the basis of distributional criteria. A later component falters the retrieved collocations, removing the ones where the participat-ing words are not used consistently in the same syntactic relationship. This post-processing stage doubles the precision of the system. We believe that using from the start a more sophisticated extraction model to collect these pairs of related words will have similar positive effects. Other linguistic components, such as a morphology module that combines frequency counts, should also improve the performance of the system, In this way, we can benefit from linguistic knowledge without having to use a separate filtering process after expending the effort to coUeet the collocations.","Similarly, the sense disambiguation problem is typically attacked by comparing the distribution of the neighbors of a word's occurrence to prototypical distributions associated with each of the word's senses [Gale et al., 1992, Schtltze, 1992]. Usually, no explicit linguistic knowledge is used in defining these neighbors, which are taken as all words appearing within a window of fixed width centered-at the word being disambiguated. Many words unrelated to the word of interest are collected in this way. In contrast, identifying appropriate word classes that can be expected on linguistic grounds to convey significant information about the original word should increase the performance of the disambiguation system. Such classes might be modified nouns for adjectives, nouns in a subject or object position for verbs, etc. As we have showed in Section 5, less but cleaner information increases the quality of the results.","An interesting topic is the identification of parallels of our fingulstic modules for these applications, at least for those modules which, unlike morphology, are not ubiquitous. Negative knowledge for example improves the performance of our system, supplementing the positive information provided by adjective-noun pairs. It could be useful for other systems as well if an appropriate application-dependent method of extractmg such information is identified. 51 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK","We have showed that all lin$uistic features considered in this study had a posiuve contribution to the performance of the system. Except for ~spell-checking, all these contributions were both statistically significant and large enough to make a differencce in practical situations. Furthermore, the results can be expected to generalize to a wide variety of corpus-based systems for different applications.","The cost of incorporating the linguistics-based modules in the system is not prohibitive. The effort needed to implement all the linguistic modules was about 5 person-months, in contrast with 7 person-months needed to develop the basic statistical system. Furthermore, the run-time overhead causedby the linguistic modules is not significant. Each takes from lto 7 minutes on a Sun SparcSta-tion 10 to process a million entries (words or pairs) and all except the negative knowledge module need process a corpus only once, reusing the same information for different adjective sets. This should be compared to the approximately 15 minutes needed by the statistical component for grouping about 40 adjectives.","In the future, we plan to extend the results discussed in this paper by an analysis of the dependence of the effects of each parameter on the values of the other parameters. We are currently stratifying the experimental data obtained to study trends in the magnitude of parameter effects as other parameters vary in a controlled manner, and we will examine the interactions with corpus size and specificity of clustered adjectives. We are also interested in providing similar quantitative results for other applications, to corroborate our belief in the generality of the importance of easily obtainable linguistic knowledge for statistical systems.
