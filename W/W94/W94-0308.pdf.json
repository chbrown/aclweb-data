The reader is expected to pull down the white plastic tray, remove that tray: and then unpack the cable. Current studies of instructional text (e.g.. RSsner and Stede, 1992; Vander Linden, 1993) typically represent the relationship found here in a simple multi-dependent structure such as that provided by the Sequence schenla in Mann and Thompson:s Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (1988) (see figure 1A). This rhetorical structure, which represents three sequential actidns, directly matches the grammatical forms used in the actual text.

The English version is perhaps best characterised as a Means relation, whereas the French is a Purpose relation and the German a Circumstance.","The problem examples such as these raise for generation is twofold: (a) how do we endow our systems with the necessary flexibility to generate alternative expressions of the same basic information and (b) given this flexibility., how do we determine which of the available expressions are appropriate? The root of these problems is that, to date, research in the generation of instructions has failed to take account of the precise procedural relations that underlie the texts. In this paper, we make an excursion into the philosophical literature on Action Theory and the AI literature on plan recognition to find solidly defined procedural relations which can capture the underlying semantics of actions and their relationships in a way that will prove useful for our generation task: building multilingual instructional text generation systems. We present the results of part of an ongoing investigation of the utility of the Gene~ution and Enablement relations in contributing to our stated goal.","Procedural Relations The philosopher Alvin Goldman identified two basic procedural relations; Generation and Enablement~ that apply between actions in a task (GoMman: 1970). These have been formalised within the Planning community and shown to be useful constructs for plan recognition (Pollack, 1986; Balkanski: 1993). In this section we re-view the definitions of Genelution and Enablement and describe how we have applied them in our analysis of a corpus of instructional texts in English, French and Portuguese. The Generation Relation A simple test of Generation holding between action pairs is whether it can be said that by performing one of the actions (a); the other (/3) will automatically occur (Pollack: 1986); if this is the case then it can be said that (a) gene~utes (/3). According to Goldman, Generation is a relation applying between two aet-token.~ in certain well-defined situations. For purposes of producing instructions, however, we find it necessary to view Generation as hohting between act-types: since we are dealing with actions that have not yet taken place; we are able to do this without distorting the general theory that Goldman presents (cf. Pollack. 1986). Here are some canonical examples of this relation taken from Goldman: (6~a) John flips the switch. (cQ (b) John turns on the light. (/~) where flipping the switdl generates turning on the light and (7~a) John moves his queen to king-knight-seven. (cr) (b) John checkmates his opponent. (/3)","where moving the queen to king-knight-seven generates","checkmating the opponent. Following Goldman, Generation holds in cases where:","Â• the actions concerned are performed by the same agent (e.g., John). For reasons that will become dearer later on, we have found it necessary to qual-if)' and extend this part of the definition to actions performed or perceived to be pelJolTned by the same human agent.","Â• the relation is asymmetric: if the agent does /3 by doing a' then he does not do a' by doing/3 (e.g., the switch cannot be flipped by turning on the light).","Â• neither action is subsequent to the other (e.g.; the light does not come on after the switch is flipped, or ~rice versa) l . A useful linguistic test for this is the invalidity of the expression '% and then i3\".","Â• the actions are not co-temporal. Simply stated, if a and 3 are co-temporal, then one could validly say \"c~\" while also /3\" and vice versa: for example, \"John strummed the guitar while also wriggling his toes\". These actions are co-temporal, but not related by Generation. One could not validly say that John flipped on the switch while also turning on the light, or moved his queen to king-knight-seven while also checkmating his opponent.","Â• if the agent had not done a, then he would not have done/3;","Â• there is a (set of) condition(s) \"i (say, George making sure that the light bulb was screwed in) such that","According to Goldman, this holds even if the light does not come on for a few seconds at'ter the switch was flipped. 62 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994"]},{"title":"A.

Consider the following semantically equivalent instructions:","(8) Checkmate your opponent by moving your queen to king-knight seven. (9) Move your queen to king-knight seven to check, rate your opponezkt. (10) I~ you want to checkmate your opponent, move your queen to king-knight seven.","Two points are worthy of note here. The first is that although causation plays a key r61e in GeneTution, /3 is not in a strict sense caused by a'; rather,/3 is the action of (to use Goldman:s term) 'bringing about' the state that is the direct result of performing cr under specific conditions (7)- Referring back to example 6: John's flipping of the switch causes the event of the light coming on; John's 'bringing about' of this event can be captured by the expression 'turning on the light:.","The second point to be noted is that in the domain of instructions for mechanical and electronic objects there is also a hidden agent the machine itself, as an agent acting on behalf of the user. This leads to the possibility of equivalence of expressions such as ':I deleted the file\" and ':My coml)uterdeleted the file\". 'We consider these to be equally valid expressions of the generated part of a Generation relation. For example, we also count instructions such as the following (for using a cooking utensil)","(11) Imprimez un mouvement de rotation \"~","Impart a movement of ~vtation to","la garniture: elle se d~.nlonte.(Darty)","the plate, it itself removes. as instances of Generation. Expressions of generated actions with non-human agents are relatively uncommon in English instructions but (as will be discussed later) this is not true of all languages. The Enablement Relation Instructions also inchtde expressions such as the folh)wing:","(12) You must restart your Macintosh to use your new software.(Mierosoft)","(13) Before using your data cartridge: allow it to acch:- mate to your operating environment for eight hours or fo7\" the amount of time it has been exposed to dis-similar conditions whichever is less.(3M)","(14) 2 Double-click tl~e Installer icon with the mouse button. The installer displays an introductory screen. 3 Click the OK button.(Microsoft)","(15) In order to operate remote control: you m,u, st first have noted or\" memorised your code.(BeU)","These are clearly not instances of Generation, since the execution of any member of the action pair does not 'automatically ~ result in the execution of the other. In each case: some intermediating action(s) is required. Following Goldman (1970), this type of relation between action pairs is most commonly referred to as Enablement (Pollack, 1986; Balkanski: 1993; Di Eugenio, 1992). Goldman does not provide a formal definition of this relation, but Pollack gives a useful general definition: \" ... when a enables/3, then the agent needs to do some-thing more than o to guarantee that/3 will be done.\" (Pollack, 1986: page 40). A more detailed definition is provided by Balkansld: ': ... Action Ai enables action A3 if and only if there is a set of conditions: C, such that one of the conditions in C: Ci: holds as a result of the performance of Ai: and either there is a third action A~ such that A2 conditionally generates A3 under C; or C is the executability condition of A3.\" (Balkansld: 1993, page 41).","Enablement applies to all four examples above because in them: one action brings about conditions that are necessary: but not necessarily sufficient for the subsequent performance of the other. In eexample 12: the reader must restart the Macintosh in order to be in a position to be able to use the new software. There are in fact other actions necessary for the use of the software, but they are not mentioned. Acclimating the cartridge in example 13 is not sufficient to make it in use. Similarl)~ in example 14, clicking on the Installer icon only brings about a set of conditions (in this case, the appropriate menu), for the user to click the OK button. In example 63 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 15: the reader nmst know the code in order to be able to operate the remote control: although knowing the code is not enough.","Note that in some cases of Enablern.ent (e.g.: in 12 and 13)~ the intermediate action can in fact be performed in the absence of the enabling condition; the result will simply be that the enabled action will not occur. In others however (e.g.: examples 14 and 15), the intermediate action is impossible to perform when the enabling condition does not hold.","An important property of Enablement which distinguishes it from Generation is that the enabled and enabling actions can be carried out by different human agents. Goldman alludes to this in his discussion of example 6: where he introduces a necessary condition for the Generation of John turning on the light: George's screwing the bulb into the socket.","As in the case of some of the Generation examples we saw before, actions in Enablement relations can be expressed as an activity carried out by a human agent or by. say: a machine or in terms of the associated state of the agent. For example, example 15 could equally have been expressed as the following:","(16) In order teJ operate remote control: you must know your code.","(17) For the remote control to operate, you must first have noted or memorised your code. A Formalisation From our discussion so far, it is clear that the relations of Gene,ution and Enablement should be identifiable aspects of plans for perfornfing procedures. We employ a plan formalism that is a simple extension of STRIPS-styled operators developed by Fikes (1971) and expanded in the NOAH system (Sacerdoti: 1977). In our representation, plans comprise:","goal(s): an action (or set of actions) which motivate(s) the use of the plan;","constraints: states which nmst hoht before a plan can be employed. Constraints cannot be achieved through planning;","side-effects: states which arise as unplanned effects of carrying out a plan;","a body: an action or action complex which executes the plan; if these are not l/rimitive: they can them-selves be achieved through another plan;","preconditions: an action or action complex which, when carried out, leads to conditions necessary for the successful execution of the plan; i.e: the body will be executable but its execution will not generate the goal (even if the constraints hold) unless the precondition is realisable. Preconditions can be planned for}","-\"This type of preconditions relates to Pollack's (1986) g~neration-enablin.q ~:ondition. Plans must minimally have a body and goal. Actions: in turn, comprise:","constraints: these have the same properties as the con-","straints on plans;","side-effects: these also have the same properties as the","side-effects on plans;","effects: states which arise from the bringing-about of","the action;","preconditions: like the preconditions of plans; these are either an action or an action complex and can be planned for. Unlike the preconditions of plans, however, their effects must hold before the action can take place (i.e., the action cannot result if the precondition does not hold). 3 Actions must minimally have an effect. Finally: states can have evidences. These are phenomena which signify that the state holds.","As in all STRIPS-based planning formalisms, plans in our representation can have associated sub-plans. In our case: sub-plans arise through the body of a plan: the preconditions of a plan: or through the preconditions of an action.","Having set out this scheme, we can now proceed to identify instances of Generation and Enablement within our representation for instructions: a generates ~ iff a' is the body of a plan e whose goal is B. a enables/) if a is a precondition of a plan e and is the goal of plan e: or if/3 is the body of e and a' is a precondition of/3.","Figure 3 shows graphically the relationship between the notion of a plan and the Generation and Enablement relations.","Generation and Enablement in","Instructions \\'Ve have shown through examples that Generation and Enablement can be expressed in a variety of ways. In instruction generation, it is clearly important to signal the correct relationship between actions, since failure to do so could lead to situations where the user diligently carries out the action without achieving the desired effect. For example, if the following Enablement relation","(18) To clean the case: disconnect the power plug.(Microsoft) is misperceived as Generation (as it might be were it to be expressed as \"Clean the case by disconnecting the power plug\"): the user would believe that by disconnecting the plug she would be guaranteed to achieve her goal of cleaning the case; this would only result in frustra-tion, bewilderment and a still dirty case.

Why are Gene,ution relationships so infrequently expressed using sequences of clauses, and never expressed using before clauses? This clearly follows from the definition of Generation that neither action can be subsequent to the other, a relationship that is strongly implied by sequences. There are cases where sentence sequences are used to express Generation, but these are infrequent and occur in very specific syntactic situations (Vander Linden, 1993). In general; grammatical forms which typically function as expressions of sequence should be avoided when expressing Generation relationships because they tend to mislead the reader by suggesting the performance of two distinct actions.","Concerning the question of identifying the contexts in which the imperative + by, the to"]},{"title":"infinitive,","paragraphs":["and the for phrase arise, it has been observed that syntactic constraints and lexical availability appear to motivate the use of the imperative + by form and the for phrasal forms (Vander Linden, 1993)."]},{"title":"Expressing Enablement in English","paragraphs":["Enablement relations tend, in 89% of the cases, toward before conditions: one of a set of sequence forms; imperative + to infinitive and other for phrasal types.

It seems inappropriate, for instance, to express the actions in example 24 as \"Place calls by returning to your seat\" because it tends to imply that returning to your seat is all you have to do to achieve the goal.

In French it is common to achieve agent deletion by using a reflexive verb whose syntactic subject is the semantic theme of the corresponding fifll transitive verb. Although there is no explicit agent of the action, agency is readily inferred and the spirit of Goldman;s definition is preserved. More-over: the word \"automatically\" is in a sense redundant, serving to emphasize the fact that the result is achieved with no filrther action on the part of the agent.","Agent deletion may also be achieved by de-verbal nominalization: as in the following examples from manuals for a cooking utensil and for do-it-yourself home improvement:","(28) La pouss6e du ressort interne d6gage","The push of the spring inteTnal releases","le poussoir.(Darty)","the push button.

A good example of this is shown in the following: taken from a manual for a garden tractor:","(40) A CADA 100 HORAS: EveT'y 100 hour.% drene o resto de combust~vel quando drain the rest of the fuel when o n~vel estiver no mmmlo the level is at the minimum para retirar a ~igua e impurezas to get rid of the water and impurities contidas no tanque contained in the tank para n$o sobrecarregar o filtro to not overload the filter e dar nlelhor durabilidade na bomba and give better endurance in the pump injetora e bico injetor, injector and jet, resultando em consequ~ncia: em melhor ~esulting in consequence, in better funcionamento do motor.(Tobatta) performance of the motor.","Sentences such as these: with long chains of Generation relations; are not unique in Brazilian Portuguese 4. As noted; the preferred signal of the Generation relation is \"para\". For stylistic reasons (i.e.: to avoid using the same connective to link the four instances of Generation within this sentence): the author has chosen to introduce some elegant variation. The third connective \"e\" (':and\") appears as a Sequence: but what is in fact happening here is that the author has elided the \"para\" from the expression % para\" ('Sand to\"). Sequence is in fact reserved for Enablement~ but here the \"e\" (a typical example of a Sequence marker) is not misleading: since the reader has been primed by the 'rhythm: of the preceding sequence of \"para's to interpret it as yet another one. Similarly: the choice of the expression resultando em conseq~ncia seems to be motivated by the desire to avoid using yet another para. This expression of Generation on its own would be extremely awkward:","(41) ?? N~o sobrecarregue o filtro","Do not overload the filter\" resultando em conseqii6ncia em melhor resulting \"in consequence in better funcionamento do motor. pe~forw~ance of the motor.","4This example demonstrates the trazasitivity feature of Generation, discussed by Goldman (19701}. 69 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 Ex~pressing Enablement in Portuguese The 8 Portuguese manuals we report on here contained many fewer instances of Enablement than Generation. Interestingly, although para is normaUy also the default expression of Enablement, we found no instances of it in our data: presumably because this form is such a strong marker of Generation. Instead, we find Enablement to be expressed through signals of the temporal ordering of the actions involved. This we refer to as Sequence: a string of imperatives, either in consecutive sentences, or within a sentence and linked by the conjunction \"e\" (\"and\").","(42) Recoloque o filtro de p6 e monte","Re-put the filter of dust and mount","novamente o aparelho.(Dustbnster)","once again the appliance. or Antes/Depois Conditions, sequential steps signaled by the use of \"antes de\" (':before\") or \"depois de\" (':after\") or their equivalents (e.g. \"diante\" (\"before\") or \"ap6s\" (\"after\")):","(43) Antes de us~-lo leia atentamente as","Before using it read carefully the","ins t ruq.Ses.(Dustbuster)","mstruct.i.or~ :","(44) Ap6s colocar o plugue na tomada,","After to put the plug in the outlet,","pressione para baLxo a tecla do","press downwaTds on the key of the","interruptor.(Caf6 Quatro coffee machine)","inte,~'uptor.","As in the French examples: the use of expressions such as antes de tend to arise in cases where the writer appears to be attempting to preempt rather than provoke a rash action, as in the following: Desligue a serra da tomada: antes de Unplug the saul from the outlet, heloT, fazer qualquer ajuste.(Black~Decker) to make whatever adjustment."]},{"title":"Discussion","paragraphs":["Our study so far provides some important guidelines for representing and expressing Generation and Enablement: which we are soon to begin implementing in our system for generating multilingual drafts of instructions for software use and for carrying out administrative procedures. The Generation and Enablement relations have proved here to be a valuable means for capturing, in a language-independent form: some of the deep semantic relationships underlying procedures. The data analysis we report on has suggested the range of appropriate syntactic expression of Generation and Enablement in English: French and Portuguese, and regions of potential amlfiguity. For example, the imtications are that Pour in:finitive expressions in French shcmhl be avoided where possil)le (except where fldlowed by \"pourvoir\"); as should be expressions in English which use the To infinitive despite the fact that they are I.) 3, far the most frequent form of Generation in our English corpus.","Clearly, the results we present here are only indicative; as we increase the size of our corpus we expect to gain a clearer picture of the relationships between the procedural relations and their linguistic expressions. So far we have not examined the influence of the wider context in which the instances of Generation and Enablement occur in the corpus, and although we are informed on the allowable and preferable mappings from Generation and Enablement to language, we are not yet in a position to identify the influences affecting the selection of the most appropriate expression for a given instance of Generation or Enablement in a particular context. In addition, the rSle of RST in our final architecture is still not clear; we suspect that if a rSle exists, it will be to inform the choice of expression from within the allowable set.
