This system is an editor's workbench for preparation of the publication of an art history encyclopedia (the Macmillan Dictionary of Art), which is itself part of an integrated pub!ication environment being developed at GMD-IPSI. We show how an editor's tasks can be facilitated by the use of NLP (natural language processing) systems and suggest the important role of text generation in future electronic publications as products. In both cases, we focus on text generation as providing an essential new mode of information presentation. Text generation provides a quality gain in which the flexibility of the electronic product is augmented; in particular, views on knowledge expressed as text, possibly in different languages are incorporated. The major prerequisite for making this possible is an explicit and systematic representation of genres or text types combined with a general interfacing method for specific domain knowledge. 1 Overview of the paper The function of this paper is two fold. First, we present an example of a new application area for text generation: support tools for electronic publishing. Second, we provide a brief overview of a new generation architecture based closely on the 'stratified context' systemic-functional linguistic model of [Martin, 1992]. The aim of the latter introduction is primarily to promote discussion of this kind of architecture, since the details that can be presented in the space of this paper are necessarily limited. The architecture is also highly experimental at this time. The simultaneous presentation of an application emphasizes the systemic-functional lin-","*The research described in this paper was supported in part by the European ESPRIT Basic Research Action DAN: DELION (EP6665) and by the US National Science Founda-tion Grant IRI-9003087.

This editor's workbench [MShr and Rostek, 1993, Rostek et at., 1994] is part of an integrated publication environment, which has been used as a framework for the design of an electronic newspaper [Haake et al., 1993]. We are currently involved in adding natural language processing capabilities to this system--including most relevantly for this paper, multilingual text generation. This is being used both to further the theoretical specification and practical implementation of the text generation system and to enable us to concretely propose the application of text generation both in the electronically-assisted construction of encyclopedic works and in the electronic version of the electronic publication as product.","In this paper, we concentrate particularly on the use of the text generation system in order to bring a new functionality to the editor's workbench. The text generation component supports a range of flexible presentation styles tailored to the editor's requirements. The applicability of the text generation system is supported by two crucial capabilities:","* the knowledge of genres or text types, which are taken to be the ultimate constraining factor for the realization of views on domain knowledge as text,","* a methodology for building a generic interface to domain knowledge. We suggest how both these aspects have been strongly supported by a version of the systemic-functional linguistic model employing a stratified view of context.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our view of the role of natural language processing in electronic publication and introduces our application scenario. We outline here the editor's workbench and describe the necessary application of NLP components, focussing on text generation. We further show how the specific linguistic paradigm we are working with, systemic-functional linguistics, supports the integrated publication scenario. Section 3.1 presents the text generation component in more detail. We argue that the 153","7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 newly gained flexibility (views on domain knowledge expressed as text) can only be made possible in practice if the genre of the text to be produced is explicitly represented. Section 4 gives an example of generation. We conclude the paper with a summary of the new opportunities offered for electronic publishing and electronic and print publications when automatic text generation is made available in the way proposed (Section 5)."]},{"title":"2 Electronic publication and NLP","paragraphs":["Electronic publishing is an application domain in which the acquisition, representation and presentation of knowledge are major tasks which are to be fulfilled by an editor. State-of-the-art electronic publishing technology offers a number of possibilities both to facilitate these tasks and to improve on the quality of print and of electronic publications. In publishing in general, the document or text plays a central role in that it is both source and product of the publication process. Many of the tasks of an editor in this process are of a highly recursive character and are subject to a number of publisher-specific standards an editor must use. For example, the header of a biography text usually adheres to some specified standard of what information must be included and at which place. Typically, the header first gives the name or pseudonym of the artist, then his/her place and date of birth (an-d death), and possibly his/her main activity (painter, sculptor, architect etc). Such highly standardized information is currently automatically classified into a net of domain knowledge by applying pattern match-ing methods (see [Rostek et at., 1994] for examples and the methods employed).","The construction of a taxonomic inheritance hierarchy that this allows already offers new opportunities for accessing the information included and can be used to assist some of the above mentioned tasks of an editor. If, however, one would like to be able to apply these methods improving information access and assisting the editor's tasks to other kinds of information that are less standardized, the question arises of how to acquire these and integrate them in an object net.. For example, in a biography article, the typical information included is the artist's education, influences on his/her work by other artists and art styles, his/her major works etc. This is information that can appear in any place in the text-- or even in several texts--and can be realized linguistically in various ways. Extracting such information from source texts requires more sophisticated methods and representations that reflect the facts contained in the source text. The most adequate way to acquire this knowledge is automatic NL text analysis.","For an example of how this enriches the information represented in the object net see Figure 1, taking the example of the main activities and creations of the architect Peter Behrens3 This is mostly a network obtained by the KONTEXT analysis system for German [Haenelt,","1Domain-independent 'meaning model' (see below) upper structure types are given in light grey ellipses; named, unique objects and domain-specific objects are given in dark grey ellipses; instances are given in boxes. :.~.~::~:'...?-;~_~ ~, ,~r,~-..,.:-~:-~:,~ ... ~ ~j!-~z~ _ ~--~ Figure h Knowledge acquired by NL text analysis 1994], although some nodes and arcs have been left out or duplicated here for presentation purposes.","We assume that information of this kind and degree of complexity will become increasingly common in knowledge-based systems. We also assume that systems that previously worked with full-texts will increasingly become knowledge-based systems. However, hav-ing made available such a rich variety of potentially relevant information in this way, the complementary problem of presenting that information again to the user becomes the limiting factor. In our present case, the editor's workbench already offers a number of presentation styles for the information contained, such as the net or parts of the net (as shown in Figure 1, internal definitions associated with a node, article text associated with a node and cross-references to other objects, etc. Representation of complex information in the net style, how-ever, quickly becomes too complex to be generally appropriate (as the rather simple example of Figure 1 probably already demonstrates). With a net augmented both in types of information and in quantity, other presentation styles as views on the information contained are essential for enabling an editor to deal with such complex information. One such presentation style that can flexibly express retrieved information is automatically generated text. Information including that displayed in Figure 1 (and other information not shown) is better expressed as the following text.","Sample Text 1 Behrens' principal activities were industrial design and architecture. He designed prototype flasks and electrical appliances. As an architect, he built the turbine factory and the high tension plant for AEG (.1908-10). For the workers of AEG he built a housing area in Henningsdorf. Behrens created a number of monumental buildings, such as the Mannesmann administration building in Dfisseldorf and the German embassy in St. Petersburg.","For further examples and motivations for using text generation in this kind of electronic publishing scenario, 154","7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine ° June 21-24, 1994 see [Teich and Bateman, 1994]. 3 The text generation architecture 3.1 Origins For the kind of functionality set out in the previous section to be both achievable in theory and worthwhile in practise, we consider two features of a text generation component to be decisive. First, the text generation system must achieve a high degree of domain-independence in order to maximally re-use its resources. Such resources are too expensive to develop to allow redesign for different applications. And second, it must make provision for the systematic representation of genres and text types that it will be called to generate. The representation of genre not only offers a major constraint on the text generation process, including its access to domain knowledge, but also allows highly restricted fine-tuning of a system's generation capabilities.","The generation system being used in our application scenario is one under development in two continuing directions. First, it is multilingualin the extreme sense defined by [Bateman et al., 1991a, Bateman et al., 1991b]. The system thus supports extensive linguistic resource sharing on a functional basis. Second, it is intended to incorporate sensitivity to register as targetted by [Bateman and Paris, !989, Bateman and Paris, 1991]. The system processes are based on the PENMAN generation system [Mann and Matthiessen, 1985] as extended for multilinguality by [Zeng, 1992], and includes work on multilinguality and text planning undertaken within the KOMET project [Bateman et al., 1993]. The resulting system therefore has the working title KPML (KOMEW-Penman multilingual).","The primary difference between the KOMET-PENMAN system and PENMAN is that KPML attempts to apply systemic-functional linguistic results at all levels of operation, following through some of the proposals for interaction between systemic linguistics and computational models made in [Bateman, 1988]. It therefore includes linguistic resources at various strata such as:","• the systemic functional grammar NIGEL for English [Matthiessen, 1992] and the KOMET grammars for German [Teich, 1992] and for Dutch [Degand, 19931,","• a merged upper model [Henschel, 1993] appropriate for generation with all three grammars,","• systemic-functional networks for register, based on [Martin, 1992],","• system-functional networks for genre, also based on [Martin, 1992]. Work on discourse semantics, in the sense defined in [Martin, 1992], is also in progress 2 Realization is captured in terms of relational constraints holding across features and structures defined by the networks of adjacent strata. These are still partially implemented in","2Particularly in the context of the DANDELION basic research project. terms of Penman-style 'preselection', althoush nondirectional relations such as those suggested in [Bateman et al., 1992] are both necessary and under investigation. 3.2 Genre and Register: the global-level","textual resource According to systemic-functional theory (SFL), the ultimate constraints on all linguistic expression are the extra-linguistic contexts of culture and situation. Especially in a multilingual application this must be taken into account since it is only in these extra-linguistic contexts that commonalities and differences between languages can ultimately be rooted. In early work on text in context such as [Hasan, 1978], the cultural context is reflected in language in terms of text as the linguistic category of genre. Genre is a culture-specific category textually encoding a situation as it can typically occur in a culture or linguistic community. Thus, it is at the interface between what is linguistic and what is non-linguistic knowledge. The particular view on genre and context that we instantiate in the KOMET-PENMAN architecture 3 is that proposed in [Martin, 1992]. Here context is divided into two strata, register and genre. Both are fully represented in our model.","Genre is represented in SFL by generic structure potential (GSP), specifying the potential typically occurring stages according to which a text belonging to a particular genre develops [Hasan, 1978]. As a brief example of a GSP and its application, a typical field (one of the parameters of register; cf. below) in the domain of arts is information about an artist's life. A typical situation in terms of field involves all kinds of activities and events a particular artist is or was involved in in his/her career and the circumstances under which these events take or took place. It is not possible from this information alone to construct any particular text. Only when a particular text type has been selected is it possible to determine what information from the field is relevant and how it is to be presented. One genre that usefully expresses such a typical situation is the biography. A typical GSP for a biography text then has the following stages, of which not all are obligatory: GSP stages Names, birth and death Education, development of career Major activities, major works Influences, analogies to other artists Impact Uncovering such generic structures is a large empirical task that needs to be addressed in text generation: a system such as KPML can then be seen as one candidate way of noting the results of such studies in an immediately usable fashion.","Following [Martin, 1992], we provide a systemic account of genre using the same representational means as for grammatical descriptions (system networks). This permits generic structures to be constructed according to the selection of genre features in exactly the same","3For further detailed motivations for this selection, see [Bateman and Paris, in preparation]. 155 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994","biography ( instant tat e","Particular (v / Mea-Person)) (stage Name) ( inst ant tat e","Name (v / Mea-Named","actee Particular) ) (stage Birth) (instantiat e","Birth (v / Mea-Birth-Event","actor Particular) ) ( int er-pr e s elect -feature","Birth reconstruction) (int er-Pres elect-f eature","Birth activity) (stage Education) Figure 2: Realization statements for the genre [biography] way that grammatical structures are constructed in our grammars--i.e., by means of the selection of grammatical features in system networks. The GSPs that result then condition the further realization of register selections in the linguistic system proper. Thus situation types are related to the linguistic system in particular ways by the selection of particular genres. The systemicization of genre specifications also ensures that there can be maximal re-use of existing genre specifications when new genres, slightly differing from already treated ones, are considered.","Furthermore, as noted by [Matthiessen, 1988], generic structures are in many ways similar to [McKeown, 1985]'s rhetorical schemas. They can also be used, therefore, in order to pre-structure the information to be expressed in a text. Particular kinds of information go together with particular stages of the GSP. The specification of this information--in our case as constraints in the genre network concerning appropriate selections of field features and structures-7-provides the content for information retrieval inquiries that are passed on to the editor's workbench for instantiation. An example of such a specification is shown in the instantiate realizations for the genre-feature [biography] given in Figure 2. The realization constraints stage introduce generic stages in a GSP; the constraints inter-preselect-feature constrain a given generic stage to be realized by a particular register feature selection.","The use of GSPs for knowledge selection is further enhanced by our requirement that domain information is already classified according to a general conceptual hierarchy for organizing domain information that is specified by KOMET-PENMAN internally. This guarantees that the retrieved information is in a form which can be readily interpreted by the other resources of the linguistic system maintained internally to KOMET-PENMAN. This provides the definitions for the semantic types used in the SPL-like second parameter to the 'instantiate' constraints shown in Figure 2. At present, information is retrieved from the editor's workbench which matches the these second parameters. Work in progress is exploring more sophisticated information retrieval operations.","The representation of genre therefore offers a major constraint on the text generation process, including its access to domain knowledge. As mentioned before, not all of the stages of a GsP are obligatory. This gives rise to a number of subtypes of the biography genre. For example, a short biographical entry, as it typically occurs in an encyclopedia realizes all stages and tends to be activity-focussed and timeline organized. Our sample text 1, on the other hand, did not realize all stages; it presents more the roles Behrens took on as an artist (designer, architect) and his major works in one of these roles (the text therefore focuses on activities of creation and the results of these creative processes and is not explicitly timeline organized). Both kinds of texts are, however, useful for an editor (and for an information seeker) in particular contexts and so both should be available presentation styles. Unless the text generation component allows the ready definition of such genres and their linguistic realizations with maximal re-usablity of existing resources, such flexibility will be compromised.","The next strata in the system, register, is further described in terms of the three parameters of field, tenor and mode. Field describes the states and events and participants occurring in a particular situation. Tenor refers to the roles and statuses of the participants in a particular situation. Mode refers to the symbolic organization of the situation as text, including the channel of communication and the rhetoric goals [Halliday and Hasan, 1989, p12]. Specific sets of values that realize field, tenor and mode bring about situation types or registers. Particular situation types accordingly constrain the kind of language that may occur in those situations.","Certain aspects of register are constrained by the situation that the text generator is to understand itself as being in--thus, whether the text is to be written or spoken, whether the relationship between the hearer and the speaker/writer is distant or close, etc. must be selected externally. The provision of such features in the register specification automatically provides a high degree of parameterization. Moreover, the field information provides a natural home for many aspects that would traditionally be included under 'domain knowledge'. This information is quite removed from its expression in natural language. In order to interface with such information, however, we provide a general subsumption hierarchy analogous to previous usages of the upper model within PENMAN"]},{"title":"(cf.","paragraphs":["[Bateman, 1990]). Further details of the motivation and development of this hierarchy are given in [Bateman et al., 1994]. This (domain-independent) 'upper structure' of the domain knowledge is motivated by the semantics defined by our NLP components (e.g. [Kunze and Firzlaff, 1993, Bateman et al., 1990, Henschel, 1993]). We see examples of the use of the hierarchy in Figure 1 in the net objects prefixed by Mea-.","The hierarchy can in general be considered to be a system network with realization constraints (further conditionalized by the contributions of feature selections from the mode and tenor hierarchies) effecting 156","7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 the possible semantic and grammatical realizations that may be adopted. However, the interfacing with domain knowledge is further supported by allowing the mixing of KOMET-PENMAN internally specified system networks and externally specified resource organizations, such as, e.g., that for domain knowledge. Most of the upper structure for the domain knowledge is therefore represented externally in SFK (the 'Smalltalk FFrameKit' [Fischer and Rostek, 1993]), which is the implementation language for the editor's workbench. This is linked back to a KOMET-PENMAN internal portion of the hierarchy which directly attaches to the top-most field features and positions the combined field hierarchy with respect to tenor and mode. When an external field feature has consequences for linguistic realization, it is 'imported' into the KOMET-PENMAN internal systemic network by means of external-system definitions. These function entirely analogously to internal systems as far as the connectivity of the network is concerned, but the selection of features in such systems is linked directly to the state of the corresponding external representation. In practice this permits modUles of external 'system networks' to be incorporated in the text generation process.","The constraints of the genre specification as GSP and register on local-level discourse organization of the text are manifold. For example, with a GSP for a biography text as sketched above, the thematic development is typically taking'the person the text is about as macro-theme. Also, very often biography texts are organized along a time line -- circumstantials of time such as dates, years or time adverbials are therefore often thematic or part of theme. We are currently extending the set of such constraints based on further analysis of text types that are useful in our application context.","Finally, as already noted, there can also be subtypes of the biography genre that do not have all of the stages listed above, but focus on one or two of them, leav-ing out others (see again sample text 2). They therefore realize only parts of the information available in the field of context (i.e. the domain knowledge). This contributes to the formation of distinct views on the information maintained in the editor's workbench and electronic publications: The organization of the possible genres in terms of a systemic classification hierarchy then guarantees that we are able to capture similarities between related genres and to represent the constraints they share in an efficient fashion."]},{"title":"4 Example of generation","paragraphs":["In this section we present a very brief example of generation in the context of the editor's workbench.

The text generation process is then started with the constraint that some set of genre features hold; in addition, some set of register features are also selected in order to characterize the communicative situation. The text generation component then constructs a full GSP specification for the text type. This sets up staged sets of constraints on knowledge to be selected from the domain. That information is retrieved and classified according to the complete register classification network. This establishes * a set of constraints for the semantics and grammar,","• a set of pools of contextual information that are to be realized linguistically. The latter are then organized rhetorically, thematically, ideationally, etc. according to the constrained semantics, which results in sets of rhetorically organized semantic specifications that can be passed to the constrained grammar for final realization.","More specifically, the text generation component carries out the following operations. First, the editor's workbench provides a focus for the textual summary that is to be constructed for the internal information represented and triggers generation. A specific genre must also be selected at this point: for example, one classified by the set of genre features: {activity-focused partial-biography third-person-recount particularized factual-genre). These features give rise to the concrete GSP: (DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES)","Each of these stages has particular information needs, which are then instantiated with respect to the knowledge base. For example, for the stage ACTIVITIES, the information needed consists of events and activities the artist dealt with is involved in as actor or causer. This is specified in an SFK retrieval pattern with the artist (Behrens) as starting point and providing the slot path along which the retrieval takes place; this is shown in Figure 4.","An example of the result of this information request is as follows: (SFK-337 / MEACREATION","ACTOR","(SFK-338 / (BEHRENS MEAOBJECT 157 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 Figure 3: Generation architecture respecting genre MEANAMEDMEAMALE)) TARGET (SFK-339 / (MEAOBJECT DECOMPHOUSINGAREA)) SPATIALLOCATION (SFK-340 / (MEA-THREEDIMENSIONALOBJECT","HENNINGSDORF)) BENEFICIARY (SFK-341 / (MEAPERSON PERWORKERMEAPARTOF)","PARTOF","(SFK-342 / (AEGMEAOBJECT","MEANAbIED))))","Here a number of domain instances (SFK-337, etc.) with particular types (e.g., MEACREATION, MEAOBJECT, etc.) are returned. These types are as defined in the field conceptual hierarchy. In-stances with particular types also have associated roles (e.g., ACTOR, TARGET, PARTOF). The instance specification as a whole represents a partial register-stratum structure. This partial structure is then filled out to a maximal description by traversing the register-stratum classification networks. This traversal is partially constrained by the GSP, by the instantial domain structure, and the specified context of generation. The result of this traversal is a full set of register features, and a set of corresponding constraints on the semantic and discourse realization of the generic stage. An extract from a register 'profile' resulting from such a traversal is shown in Figure 5.","These constraints are then applied during the further lexicogrammatical expression of the information retrieved from the knowledge base in order to construct an appropriate text. This is mediated by the local-discourse semantics that groups the information of the generic stage into rhetorically organized semantic specifications. These specifications consist of a statement of the propositional content, plus discourse constraints. An example is shown in Figure 6.","The final (English) text then generated is, in this case, as follows.","\" -- Behrens's principal activities were architecture and industrial design. -- He made electrical appliances and prototype flasks. -- He built the high tension plaxLt aa~d the turbine factory for AEG in 1908 - 1910. -- He built a housing area for the workers of AEG in Henningsdorf. -- He created a number of monumental buildings, such as the administration building of Mannesmann in Duesseldorf and the German embassy in St. Petersburg.\"","The text could clearly be improved in a number of ways, many of which form active areas of research.
