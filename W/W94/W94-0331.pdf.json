A lot of CL orientated NLP (including NLG) has concentrated on either trying to formulate universal theories that cover all aspects of languagh or developing very restricted theories which model smal! areas. The utilisation or expansion of these ideas to realistic systems which are not highly restricted by their t~k or domain has proved a great problem. Problems associated with other engineering disciplines which have to be considered in NL are: Scale: The size of systems (e.g., grammar coverage, vocabulary size, word senses) must be sufficient for realistic large-scale applications. Integration: Components of a system must not make unreasonable assumptions about other parts. This is of-ten the case when specific NLP problems are tackled in isolation. Components should be designed and implemented so that they assist other components. Flexibility: The ability to modify systems for different tasks in different domains. Feasibility: For example, hardware requirements must aot be too great and execldtion speeds must be acceptable. This process I incorporates making the system and its components efficient. Maintainability:: How useful the system is over a long period of time. The maintenance of a large system has proved to be an important aspect of the software lifecycle [6]. Usability: The system must be able to support the applications end users want and be user-friendly. Robustness: This is a critical aspect of large-scale systems. To quote [1] \"while it [robustness] may not be a serious problem for any individual application, it has to be faced up to in general\". This aspect concerns not only the linguistic scope of the system but how it deals with input which falls outside of this scope.","The fact that there are a large number of systems and projects with very restrictive aims and few that can claim to successfully address these issues suggest that they have associated intrinsic research problems of their own.","The NLE method has foundations in the belief that it is not necessary to wait for complete linguistic theories covering all the problems associated with NL (which do not exist at present) before large, realistic and useful NL systems can be built. Instead a full array of AI techniques is employed ranging from using well-developed linguistic and logic global theories (where they exist) to more localised theories, corpora, knowledge based heuristics, adaptive techniques and at the lowest level ad-hoc rules. Incorporating this wide range of methods means that the development of the system does not get stuck due to the difficulty in following a particular logical or linguistic theory while the benefits of such well established theories can still be enjoyed. The result is a practical, working solution."]},{"title":"2.2 The LOLITA system","paragraphs":["The LOLITA system has been developed over the last eight years at Durham University. It belongs to only a small group of systems which can claim to have addressed most of the properties required of large engineered systems as described above. The rarity of systems such as LOLITA is exemplified by the fact that NL system terminology defined in [1] has to be extended to define LOLITA's status; it is more than a generic system as it is not restricted to a single task type, but it is not, as it stands, a general purpose machine which can be used for any task in any domain. We extend the terminology by defining LOLITA as a general purpose base. Although demonstration prototypes have been built using LOLITA 241 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 for various tasks and domains (e.g., template building, dialogue analysis and generation, interactive query, machine translation, chinese tutoring [2]), no polished final application has yet been developed. This is because our research resources have been concentrated on the 'base' of the system and thus the task-dependent development has not resulted in such systems.","LOLITA is built around an original kind of conceptual graph (a logically precise form of semantic network, see for example [12]) which is accessed, modified and manipulated by the other system components (including the generator). This representation, which holds world information and data as well as some of its linguistic data, currently comprises over 30,000 nodes (capable of more than 100,000 inflected word forms). It is presently being integrated with Princeton's WordNet [11] which will increase its size to more than 70,000 nodes. LOLITA can parse text, semantically and pragmatically analyse its meaning and add relevant information to the semantic network. It has been built to cope with"]},{"title":"full","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"serious","paragraphs":["text [1] (e.g. newspaper articles), as well as text containing errors.","LOLITA is implemented in the functional language Haskell.

This approach has led to researchers making some unlikely assumptions as to the input to their generators. For example, some generators assume the existence of a set of clause-size predicates from which the generator must choose, organise and realise [3].","The LOLITA generator has been developed as a part of a complete NL system. It has been built in tandem with the semantic network representation from which it generates and each component has influenced the development of the other (e.g. the recent improvement in the semantic representation of time and location was implemented with the requirements of the generator module in mind). This highly integrated approach prevents the problem of lack of expressibility found in other systems [10]. Workers have found that the input representation they use or assume is not isomorphic with the linguistic realisation resources they employ. This 'generation gap' problem does not arise in LOLITA as the semantic network representation is always expressible in surface NL.","Although pieces of semantic network are always directly realisable, the generation allows"]},{"title":"flexibility","paragraphs":["and high"]},{"title":"usability","paragraphs":["by performing transformations on the representation to allow generation to be tailored for different tasks.

The separation of the grammar is to be investigated in the near future and it is believed that this will improve the maintainability and grammatical coverage of the generator.","A full description of the LOLITA generator cannot be presented here but, by way of example, two transformations which operate on the semantic network during the generation process are now outlined. 242 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 KEY: ~:~ o:Ot~a:t ~Acliol * Dim~ ......... • J~l~ Figure 1: Example of a verb/instrument specialisation transform 3.1 Abstract Transformations"]},{"title":"I I ~ ~\"n /~ ~ I ( -===~","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Simplified portion of semantic network for the realisation example Abstract transformations are low-level transformations which act on the :semantic network immediately before realisation. Associated with each abstract transformation are theoretical issUes on why particular normal forms are chosen, rules which allow us to move away from these normal forms and' effects the transform has on the final utterance (apart from the obvious one that variations are more natural).","Abstract transformations can act on and produce variations for events with, for example, antonym verbs, copula verbs, complemented verbs, verbs which have de-lexical structures, verbs which can be either specialised or generalised and events with multiple subjects. In each case the procedure is tO disconnect arcs from particular nodes and reconnect them to different ones (which might already exist or have to be constructed in the network). Figure 1 is an example network portion showing how a verb specialisation: transform can be applied. The verb in the original sentence 'Jack wounded Jill with a gun' may be specialised: into 'shot' because firearms (of which guns are specialisa~ions) usually wound by shooting. Furthermore as 'guns' are considered to be the most common specialisation of firearms, the instrument clause can (as-suming no special Context or high precision flag is set) be dropped leaving 'Jack shot Jill'. This abstract transformation relies on a certain amount of plausible inference: if a high precision flag has been set (according to the required style of output) then the output may be modified, e.g., 'It is likely that Jack shot Jill'.","As in the LOLITA system, Jacob's KING generator [4] uses a knowledge intensive semantic network to move from normal forms of representation to alternative forms. However Jacob's method requires special entries in the semantic network (e.g., a special entry representing 'hug giving' is required to produce the delexical structure 'to give a hug'). 3.2 Realisation Realisation is the final step in the generation hierarchy and involves the traversal of the semantic network to produce sentences. Higher levels in the generation module (planning and dialogue analysis) pass down instructions which indicate which events and relations should be in-cluded in the utterance (i.e the content). The textual organisation of the utterance has to be decided by .the realisation module using the constraints passed down fi'om above. The general operation of the realiser module is to follow the arcs starting from the input node to find further nodes and their associated information. According to the type of these nodes (e.g., if this node is itself an event node with many links) this process may be continued recursively.","The realiser combines both the deep and surface realisation of the network. Choices between, for example, passive and active, or dative and non-dative, sentences are passed to the realiser as parameters. In a sense the 243 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 grammar of the output is hardwired into the code, but variation and flexibilty is allowed through the use of these parameters. This setup has proved sufficient for all the applications for which prototypes have been built.","Figure 2 shows a (much simplified) portion of the semantic network containing an example event El. The realiser operates by following arcs (e.g., subject, action, object etc) from this event to other nodes in the network and recursively generating expressions for these nodes. If the default parameters are being used the events will be generated in the active voice and the default rhythm is to allow one relative clause for each object. The output produced in this example is \"If Roberto knew that the woman whom he loves owned the big fast motorbike that I gave him then he would like it.\" An umsimplified portion of the semantic network will of course be more richly populated. There may, for example, be many more arcs from the node representing Roberto which link to more information about him. If planning instructions indicate that this information should be expressed it is likely that the realiser will have to split the utterance into separate sentences. Events which are encountered by the realiser which cannot be immediately expressed (because the resulting sentence will be too long) are placed on a stack so that they cg.n be expressed as separate sentences. Heuristics are used to order this stack of events so that coherent focus and decipherable anaphoric references are maintained (the development of these heuristics is ongoing).","Stylistic variations can be produced by altering the realiser parameter settings and passing different nodes to the realiser so the text is realised from a different angle. Example parameter switches are Passive/Active, Dative/Non-Dative, Colour, Rhythm, Length, De-lexical transformations, Copula transformations, Complement transformations, Synonyms transformations, Verb Antonym transformations, Verb Specialisation, Verb Generalisation."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has given a brief outline of the LOLITA system and some aspects of its generation component.
