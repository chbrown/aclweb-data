Srinivas Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA {joshi, srini} @linc.cis.upenn.edu Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we pursue the idea that by making the descriptions of primitive items (lexical items in the linguistic context) more complex, we can make the computation of linguistic structure more local 1. The idea is that by making the descriptions of primitives more complex, we can not only make more complex constraints operate more locally but also verify these constraints more locally. Statistical techniques work better when such localities are taken into account 2 Of course, there is a price for making the descriptions of primitives more complex. The number of different descriptions for each primitive item is now much larger than when the descriptions are less complex. For example, in a lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (LTAG), the number of trees associated with each lexical item is much larger than the number of standard parts-of-speech (POS) associated with that item. Even when the POS ambiguity is removed the number of LTAG trees associated with each item can be large, on the order of 10 trees in the current English grammar in the XTAG system s. This is because in LTAG, roughly speaking, each lexical item","1 Let ~ be the alphabet consisting of the names of elmentary trees in an LTAG.

This, of course, increases the local ambiguil.y for the parser. The parser has to decide which complex description (LTAG tree) out of the set of descriptions associated with each lexical item is to be used for a given reading of a sentence, even before combining the descriptions together. The obvious solution is to put the burden of this job entirely on the parser. The parser will eventually disambiguate all the descriptions and pick one per object, for a given reading of the sentence. This is what the parser is expected to do for disambiguating the standard POS, unless a separate POS disambiguation module is used (Church, 1988). Many parsers, including XTAG, use such a module ('alh'd a POS tagger.","LTAGs present a novel opportunity to reduce the amount of disambiguation done by the parser. We can treat the LTAG trees associated with each lexic'al item as more complex parts-of-speech which we call supertags. In this paper, we report on some experiments on direct supertag disambiguation, without parsing in the strict sense, using lexical preference and local lexical dependencies (acquired from a corpus parsed by the XTAG system). The information extracted from the XTAG-parsed corpus contains, for each item and its supertag, a probability distribution of the distances of other items and their supertags that are expectcd by it..

For example, the Waltz algorithm (Waltz, 1975) for la-I)eling vertices of polygonal solid objects can be thought of in these terms, although it is not usually described in this way. There is no statistical computations in the Waltz algorithm, however. The supertag disambiguation experiments, as far as we know, are the first to use these ideas in the linguistic context. Of course, we :ds(~ show how the supertag disambiguation naturally lends itself to the application of statistical techniques. I1, tl,, lbllowing sections we will briefly describe our approach and some preliminary results of supertag disambiguation as an illustration of our main theme: the relationship of the complexity of descriptions of primitives to local statistical computations. A more complete analysis of this technique and experimental results will eventually be reported elsewhere."]},{"title":"Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars","paragraphs":["l,exicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is a lexicalized tree rewriting grammar formalism (Schabes, 1990). The primary structures of LTAG are called EL-EMEN'FARY TREES. Each elementary tree has a lexical item (anchor) on its frontier and serves as a complt~x description of the anchor. An elementary tree provides a domain of locality larger than that provided by CFG rules over which syntactic and semantic (predicate-argument) constraints can be specified. Elementary trees are of two kinds: INITIAL TREES and AUXI,,IARY TREES. Examples of initial trees (as) and ~u]xi[iary trees (,Ss) are shown in Figure 1. Nodes on th(. frontier of initial trees are marked as substitution sites by a '~', while exactly one node on the frontier ~)[\" an auxiliary tree, whose label matches the label of the root of the tree, is marked as a foot node by a '.'. 'l'hv other nodes on the frontier of an auxiliary tree are marked as substitution sites. LTAG factors out recursi()n f,-om the statement of the syntactic dependencies.

Substitution inserts elemenl;iry I.i',.,~s at the substitution nodes of other elementary trees. Adjunction inserts auxiliary trees into elementary trees at the node whose label is the same as the root label of the auxiliary tree. As an example, the component trees ( as, c~2, aa, c~4,/38, as, as), shown in Figure 1 can be combined to form the parse tree for the sentence John saw a man with the telescope 4 as follows: 1. ors substitutes at the NP0 node in a2.","2. aa substitutes at the DetP node in c~4, the result of which is substituted at the NP1 node in c~.","3. a5 substitutes at the DetP node in as, the result of which is substituted at the NP node in/3s.","4. The result of step (3) above adjoins to the VP node of the result of step (2). The resulting parse tree is shown in Figure 2.","The process of combining the elementary trees that yield a parse of the sentence is represented by the derivation tree, shown in Figure 2. The nodes of the derivation tree are the tree names that are anchored by the appropriate lexical item. The composition operation is indicated by the nature of the arcs-broken line for substitution and bold line for adjunction-while the address of the operation is indicated as part of the node label. The derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency graph with unlabeled arcs between words of the sentence as shown in Figure 2.","We will call the elementary trees associated with each lexical item super part-of-speech tags or supertags.","4The parse with the PP attached to the NP has not been shown. 54 NP DetP $ N John Sr V NIp"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["C~2 DetP"]},{"title":"I D J","paragraphs":["I ~3 NP","DetP,I, N NS A P NIg"]},{"title":"I I mn .kh","paragraphs":["~4"]},{"title":"~01","paragraphs":["DetP"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["D"]},{"title":"I the","paragraphs":["of 5 NP DetP $ N"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["telescope N,"]},{"title":"]","paragraphs":["John Sr","~t]~ vp HA"]},{"title":"IA I","paragraphs":["maw ~7 DetP r D"]},{"title":"D~Pp I i A ~ HA P NK I","paragraphs":["Det P • D DetPf"]},{"title":"I the","paragraphs":["N, N tele~:ope"]},{"title":"~7","paragraphs":["N"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["John 0C8"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["v ~"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["DetP"]},{"title":"A D Dd, I 8 I","paragraphs":["N"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["m vP IT P NI~I,"]},{"title":"I wUh","paragraphs":["DetP"]},{"title":"I the","paragraphs":["0~9 ~10 O~ll ~8 ~12 NP"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["N"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["telescope Or18 Figure 1: Elementary trees of LTAG 55 S, NP"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["N"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["John VP V NP mw DetP N"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["D ~n"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["i PP P NIP with I~tP N"]},{"title":"I I I","paragraphs":["d~ ~..,2[Mw] a_8[John] (1) p~8[with] (2) a_4[man] (2.2)"]},{"title":"I ! a_6[telescope] (2.2) a.fl[a] (1) I I","paragraphs":["a_S[the] (1) Parse Tree Derivation Tree MW"]},{"title":"J-----7-----------....

However, since dependencies between supertags do not occur in a fixed sized window, the n-gram model is unsuitable for supertagging. This limitation can be overcome if no a priori bound is set on the size of the window, but instead a probability distribution of the distances of the dependent supertags for each supertag is maintained. A supertag is dependent on another supertag if the former substitutes or adjoins into the later.","paragraphs":["Experiments.and Results Table (1) shows the data required for the dependency model of supertag disambiguation. Ideally each entry would be indexed by a (word, supertag) pair but, due to sparseness of data, we have backed-off to a (POS, supertag) pair. Each entry contains the following information. • POS and Supertag pair.","• List of + and -, representing the direction of the dependent supertags with respect to the indexed supertag. (Size of this list indicates the total number of dependent supertags required.) • Dependent supertag.","• Signed number representing the direction and the ordinal position of the particular dependent supertag mentioned in the entry from the position of the indexed supertag.","• A probability of occurrence of such a dependency. The sum probability over all the dependent supcrt:ags at all ordinal positions in the same direction is one.","For example, the fourth entry in the Table 1 reads that the tree a2, anchored by a verb (V), has a left, and a right dependent (-, +) and the first word to the left (-1) with the tree as serves as a dependent of the current word. The strength of this association is represented by the probabilit3/0.300.","The dependency model of disambiguation works as follows. Suppose a2 is a member of the set of supertags associated with a word at position n in the sentence. The algorithm proceeds to satis|~ the dependency requirement of a2 by picking up the dependency entries for each of the directions. It picks a dependency data entry (fourth entry, say) from the database that is indexed by a2 and proceeds to sct up a path with the first word to the left that has the dependent supertag (as) as a member of its set of supertags. If the first. word that has as as a member of its set of supertags is at position m, then an arc is set up between c~ and as.. Also, the arc is verified so that it does not kitestring-tangle s with any other arcs in the path up to a2. The path probability up to a2 is incremcntcd by log0.300 to reflect the success of the match. The path probability up to as incorporates the unigram probability of as. On the other hand, if no word is found that has as as a member of its set of supertags then the entry is ignored.

However, increasing the complexity of descriptions greatly increases the number of such descriptions for the primitive object. In a lexicalized grammar such as LTAG each lexical item is associated with complex descriptions (supertags) on the average of 10 descriptions. A parser for LTAG, given a sentence, disambiguates a large set of supertags to select one supertag for each lexical item before combining them to derive a parse of the sentence. We have presented a new technique that performs the disambiguation of supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies as an illustration of our main theme of the relationship of complexity of descriptions of primitives to local statistical computations. This technique, like POS disambiguation, reduces the disambiguation task that needs to be done by the parser. After the disambiguation, we have effectively completed the parse of the sentence and the parser needs 'only' to complete the adjunctions and substitutions."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Kenneth Ward Church. 1988.
