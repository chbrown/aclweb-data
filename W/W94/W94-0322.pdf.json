We present the approach to generation used in our implemented system for generating and interpret~ing indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. Generation of a discourse plan is performed in two phases: content planning and plan pruning. During content planning, stimulus conditions are used to trigger speaker goals to include appropriate extra information wit h the direct answer. Plan pruning determines what parts of this full response do not need to be stated explicitly - resulting in, in appropriate discourse contexts, the generation of an indirect answer. 1. Introduction J Imagine a discourse context for (1) in which R's use i of just (ld) is intended to convey a No, i.e., that R is not going shopping tonight. (By convention, square brackets indicate that the enclosed text was not explicitly stated.) The part of R's response consisting of (ld) - (le) is what we 'call an indirect answer to a Yes-No question, and if (lc) had been uttered, (lc) would have been called a direct answer.","l.a. O: I need a ride to the mall. b. Are you going shopping tonight? c. R: [no] d. My car's not running. e. The timing belt is broken.","According to one study of spoken English [Ste84], 13 percent of responses to Yes-No questions were indirect answers. Thus, the ability to interpret indirect answers is required for robust dialogue systems. Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating indirect answers in a dialogue system. First, a direct yes or no alone may be misleading if extra information is needed to qualify the answer. Second, an indirect answer may contribute to a more efficient dialogue. For example, in addition to providing the requested information, it may anticipate a follow-up question from Q, or it may allow R to respond immediately without asking for clarification of the question. That is, the increased efficiency is more the result of avoid-ing the follow-up question or clarification subdialogue than the result of omitting the direct answer. Third, an indirect answer may be preferable for politeness considerations, as in (1).","We have developed a computational model for the interpretation and generation of indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. More precisely, by a Yes-No question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q (the questioner) that R (the responder) convey R's evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. An indirect answer implicitly conveys via one or more utterances R's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition p, i.e. that p is true, that p is false, that there is some truth to p, that p may be true, or that p may be false. Our model presupposes that Q's question has been understood by P~ as intended by Q, that Q's request was appropriate, and that Q and I:t are engaged in a cooperative goal-directed dialogue. Both the interpretation and generation components have been implemented in Common Lisp on a Sun SPARCstation.","A language user's pragmatic knowledge of how language is used to answer Yes-No questions in English can be used to constrain the problem of generating and interpreting indirect answers. This knowledge is encoded in our model as a set of domain-independent discourse plan operators and a set of coherence rules, described in section 2.1 Our system is reversible in that the same pragmatic knowledge is used by the generation and interpretation modules. Generation is modeled as discourse plan construction and interpretation as discourse plan inference. The output of generation is a discourse plan which can be realized by a tactical generation component [McK85], and the output of interpretation is the speaker's inferred discourse plan. We found that while the above pragmatic knowledge is sufficient for interpretation, it is not sufficient for the","1 Our main sources of data were previous studies [Hir85, Ste84], transcripts of naturally occurring two-person-dialogue lAme92], and constructed examples. 189 7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 problem of content-planning during generation.

Playing a key role in content determination, stimulus conditions describe conditions motivating a speaker to include a satellite during plan construction. They can be thought of as triggers which give rise to new speaker goals. In order for a satellite to be included, all of its applicability conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions must be true. While stimulus conditions may be derivative of deeper principles of cooperativity [Gri75a] or politeness [BL78], they provide a level of precompiled knowledge which reduces the amount of reasoning required for content determination.","Our methodology for identifying stimulus conditions was to survey linguistic studies (described be-low), as well as to analyze the possible motivation of the speaker in the examples in our corpus. According to StenstrSm [Ste84], the typical motivation for providing extra information is to answer an implicit wh-question. Other reasons cited are to provide an explanation justifying a negative answer, to qualify the answer, or \"social reasons\". Levinson [Lev83] claims that the presence of an explanation is a structural characteristic of dispreferred responses, such as refusals and unexpected answers. Brown and Levinson [BL78] show how various uses of language are motivated by politeness. For example, use of conversational implicature is one strategy for a speaker to avoid doing a face-threatening act, s and as we discuss in section 6, an indirect answer conversationally implicates the direct answer. Hirschberg [Hir85] claims that an indirect scalar response, rather than a Yes or No answer, is necessary in certain cases to avoid misleading the hearer.","In the rest of this section, we describe each of the stimulus conditions used in our system.

Further, Hirschberg claims that in a particular discourse context, there may be a partial ordering of values which the discourse participants mutually believe to be salient, and that the ranking of ei and ej in this ordering can be used to describe the ranking of pi and pj.

The expanded plan is represented as a tree of discourse acts. The goal of this phase is to make the response more concise, 17 i.e., to determine which of the planned acts can be omitted while lstill allowing Q to infer the full discourse plan. To do this, the generator considers each of the acts in the frontier of the tree from right to left. (This ensures that a satellite is considered before its related nucleus.) The generator creates a trial plan consisting of the original plan minus the nodes pruned so far and minus the current node. Then, using the interpretation imodule, the generator simulates Q's interpretation of a response containing the information that would be given explicitly according to the trial plan.

Therefore, it would consider the primitive acts specified in the full plan in the order (d), (c), (b). Since (d) is not inferrable from any other act, it would be automatically retained in the plan. Next, a trial plan with (c) pruned from it would be considered. Interpretation of the response consisting of (b) and (d) is simulated. Since the full plan could be inferred, (c) would be pruned. Next, another trial plan would be considered, where, in addition to (c), (b) has been pruned. Since the full plan could be inferred from the resulting trial response consisting of just (d), (b) would be pruned too. Thus, the output of phase two would be the plan shown in Figure 4 with (b) and (c) marked as pruned. 5. Other factors in generation The primary focus of our research has been on 1) use of pragmatic knowledge which is common to both the interpretation and generation of indirect answers, i.e. the so-called reversible knowledge, and 2) identifying stimulus conditions. In this section, we give a brief description of some other factors in generating indirect answers.","First, note that we made the simplifying assump-tion that R's only initial goal is to answer the question (accurately, efficiently, and politely). However, it is possible for R to construct an indirect answer which satisfies multiple initial goals of R. For example, R might have decided to give the answer in (12c) not only as an explanation, but also as background for R's request in (12d).","12.a. q: Are you going to the lecture? b. R: [no] c. I have to get my brakes fixed. d. Can you recommend a garage near","c ampus ?","Second, stylistic goals may affect the generation of indirect answers. In addition to affecting syntactic and lexical aspects of discourse [Hovg0, MG91, DH93], stylistic goals may affect which and how much information is given. For example, elaboration can be used to make an answer more lively, as shown in (13).","13,a. Q: Do you have a car? b. R: [yes] c. I bought a British-racing-green","Austin-Healey 3000 last week. Also, extra information that entails the direct answer (e.g. repetitions and generalizations) may be given for emphasis. Further, a stylistic goal of terseness may override the stimulus conditions we have provided for indirect answers. For example, depending upon the degree of Q's interest in R's affairs, the indirect answer in (14c) - (14f) may provide Q with more than Q cares to know.","14.a. Q: Are you going to the movies tonight? b. R: [no] c. I can't afford to. d. I spent $900 on my car last week. e. It needed a new transmission. f. The car is 15 years old.","Third, certain syntactic forms for expressing Yes-No questions require more than just"]},{"title":"yes~no","paragraphs":["to make clear whether R is confirming or disconfirming that a proposition p holds [Ste84].

Related research Our work differs from most previous work in cooperative response generation in that, in our model, the information given in an indirect answer conversationally implicates [Gri75a] the direct answer. I-Iirschberg [Hir85], who provided general rules for identifying when a scalar conversational implicature is licensed, claimed that speakers may give indirect responses to Yes-No questions in order to block potential incor-rect scalar implicatures of a simple Yes or No. She implemented a system which determines whether the Yes/No 2° licenses any unwanted scalar implicatures, and if so, proposes alternative scalar responses which do not. This type of response is similar, in our model, to a speaker's use of Use-contrast motivated by clarify-extent-indicated, as illustrated in (9). (As noted earlier, our coherence rules for the relation cr-contrast as well as our axioms for clarify-extent-indicated make use of the notion of a salient partial ordering which was elucidated by Hirsehberg.) However, Hirschberg's model does not account for quite a variety of types of indirect answers which can be generated using the other operators in our model, nor for other motives for using Use-contrast.","Rhetorical or coherence relations [Gri75b, Hal76, MT87] have been used in several text-generation systems to aid in ordering parts of a text (e.g.[Hov88]) as well as in content-planning (e.g. [McK85, MP93]). The discourse plan operators based on coherence relations in our model (i.e. the operators used as satellites of top-level operators)play a similar role in content-planning of an indirect answer. When coherence relations are used for content-planning, it is necessary to constrain the information which thereby may be selected. McKeown [McK85] uses discourse focus constraints. In [Moo89], plan selection heuristics are used that maximize the heater's presumed familiarity with the concepts in the text, prefer general-purpose to less general operators, and minimize verbosity. Maybury's [May92] system uses \"desirable\" preconditions, pre-conditions that are not inecessary preconditions, to prioritize alternative operators. In contrast to the above, by the use of stimulus conditions, our model is able to trigger new, opportunistic speaker goals.","Moore and Pollack [MP92] show the need to distinguish the intentional and informational structure of discourse, where the latter is characterized by the","2°Hirschberg did not addresss other possible types of direct answers, represented by the Answer-Hedged, Answer-Maybe, and Answer-Maybe-Not operators in our model. sort of relations classified as subject-matter relations in RST. Note that in our interpretation component [GC94], informational relations (i.e. plausible coherence relations holding between indirect answers and candidate direct answers) are used to infer the speaker's goal to convey a particular answer. Moore and Paris [MP93] argue that it is necessary for generation systems to represent not only the speaker's top-level intentional goal, but also the intentional subgoals that a speaker hoped to achieve by use of a rhetorical relation so that, if a subgoal is not achieved, then an alternative rhetorical means can be tried. In our model, the operators used as satellites of top-level answer discourse plan operators are based on RST's subject-matter relations. The primary goals of these operators are similar to the effect fields of the corresponding RST relation definitions. As Moore and Paris argue, goals based on these relation definitions are rhetorical goals, not intentional goals. However, in our model, it is possible to determine the intentional subgoals by checking which stimulus conditions motivated the speaker to include a particular satellite operator. For example, if explanation-indicated motivates R to include a Use-cause satellite, then one can view R as having the implicit intentional goal of giving an explanation. Thus, our model provides the information necessary to recover from the possible failure of (all or part of) an indirect answer.","Finally, our use of simulated interpretation during plan pruning has some similarity to previous work. In Horacek's approach to generating concise explanations [I-Ior91], a set of propositions representing the full explanation i s pruned by eliminating propositions which can be derived from the remaining ones by contextual rules. Jameson and Wahlster [JW82] use an anticipation feedback loop algorithm to generate elliptical utterances."]},{"title":"7. Conclusion","paragraphs":["An indirect answer to a Yes-No question conversationally implicates the speaker's evaluation of the truth of a questioned proposition. The generation of indirect answers is important if a dialogue system is to respond efficiently, accurately, and politely. This paper has presented the approach to generation used in our implemented system for generating and interpreting indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. Ours is the first system to generate a wide range of types of indirect answers (as well as full answers). The system is reversible in that the same pragmatic knowledge is used in generation and interpretation. Generation is performed in two phases: content planning and plan pruning. During content planning, stimulus conditions are used to trigger speaker goals to include appropriate extra information with the direct answer. Plan pruning determines what parts of this full response do not need to be stated explicitly - resulting in, in appropriate discourse contexts, the generation of an indirect 197"]},{"title":"7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 answer.
