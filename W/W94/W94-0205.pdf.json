After describing the LexPhon system and indicating how it may be set to represent alternative language descriptions within LP, its potential application in the characterisation of speech style contrasts is demonstrated through a small-scale study.","paragraphs":["1. INTRODUCTION","The theory of lexical phonology (LP) seeks to explain the inter-relationships between morphology and phonology by allocating some of the phonological processes to the dictionary or lexicon in which the morphemes reside. The functions of brackets and boundary symbols found in other phonological representations are subsumed into the framework of the system. The domains of both morphological and phonological rules within the lexicon are subdivided into strata which define both the type of morphological process applicable and the mode of operation (i.e. whether cyclic or non.cyclic) of the associated phonological rules. Processes applied on early strata are invisible to those of later strata through the application of the \"Bracket Erasure Convention\".","A computational system, LexPhon, has been devised to demonstrate the principles of LP. LexPhon comprises a level-ordered phonological interpreter and a set of linguistic tools for reformulating the stratum control, developing phonological rule sets and for devising phoneme inventories, including natural class categorisation tools for making explicit the conjunctive relationships between the elements of the inventories derived.","Aspects of LP incorporated into LcxPhon are the Strict Cyclicity Condition, Bracket Erasure and both cyclic and noncyclic control mechanisms. Syllabification is based on the Maximal Onset Principle and fully-specified underlying representations are assumed. The number of strata and attribution of each stratum to either cyclic or noncyclic control is variable by the user. Ordered sets of phonological rules are allocated to strata.","LexPhon is used for comparison of potential structures for the level-ordered frameworks within which the phonological rules operate and for alternative formulations and assignments of the rules themselves. Conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of each from the broad phonemic transcriptions resulting from applying any given setting of the system to large quantities of data and from the processing traces also provided.","An example is given of the application of LexPhon to the study of speech style, using data from reported studies of English and Mexico City Spanish and its ability to model the alternative surface forms evidenced by the data, through the re-allocation of the same set of phonological rules to different strata, is evaluated. 2. LEXlCAL PHONOLOGY (LP)","Lexical phonology (Kiparsky, 1982; 1982b; Halle and Mohanan, 1985, Booij and Rubach, 1987; and many others) is a recent approach to generative phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968) in which the application of the phonological rules, which map from the abstract, underlying form of a word to its surface, phonetic realisation, is tied to the morphological word formation ~ processes taking place.","Morphological and phonological rules are seen as part of the lexicon and are grouped into strata. The order of interaction between morphological and phonological components 43 is stratum-depndant. Thus, LP ties the application of phonological rules to morphological structure in a particularly close way. It provides a highly structured framework in which to develop and evaluate the rules and representations for phonological transformations. However, while there is considerable support for the theory of stratification of morphological rules and the cyclic nature of the application of some phonological rules, opinion is divided as to the number of strata required and the level(s) to which each of the identified phonological rules is assigned in any given language and further, as to whether such higher level control structures are universal (Booij and Rubach, 1987) or language specific (Kiparsky, 1982, Halle and Mohanan, 1985).","In addition to linear representations, LP accounts of linguistic phenomena are frequently formulated within the formats provided by autosegmental and metrical, or nonlinear phonology (for examples see Tranel, 1987; van der Hulst and Smith, 1982; Halle and Vernaud, 1982; Leben, 1982; etc.). LP descriptions usually adopt the two principle tiers from autosegmental phonology, the melody and the skeleton, to represent the data. Further layers and/or the hierarchical representations of metrical phonology may be introduced when required.","The melody corresponds roughly to the linear representation of segments whereas the skeleton carries the positional or timing information in x-slots. The x-slots, sometimes further distinguished as C and V slots, generally correspond one-to-one with the segments and are anchored to elements of the melody tier. However, in the case of long vowels, for instance, two skeletal slots may be attached to the same vowel. Empty slots and floating segments are also permitted by this theory.","Both morphological and phonological higher level structures may be attached to the skeleton tier allowing other levels of organisation, such as onset and rime within syllables, to be represented, if required.","Nonlinearity of both morphology and phonology is incorporated into LP through the structuring of the lexicon and the independence of syllabification from the word-formation process. For LexPhon, the concept of timing slots has influenced the choice of multiple segment descriptions for long vowels and diphthongs. 44","Syllabification, where needed, is derived from the current segmental representation which thus reflects both the melody and skeleton tiers.","However, by permitting features and their domains to be independent of the segment, autosegmental phonology also allows for the description of feature and tonal units smaller than a single segment. This aspect has not been utilised in the current system. 3. THE LEXPHON SYSTEM","LexPhon is implemented in Prolog, using LPA MacPROLOG and is based on principles of lexical phonology.","LexPhon is a collection of interactive linguistic tools comprising a phonological processor, or interpreter, sets of processes for creating and updating ph onem e inventories, phonological rule-sets and LP control structures and investigative tools for exploring relationships within the phoneme inventory.","The phonological processor takes as input the underlying forms of the morphemes believed to contribute to a particular word and produces, as output, a broad phonemic transcription of the resulting word. To do this, the processor applies sets o f phonological rules to the developing word string, at each level, or stratum, of morphological development, in order to demonstrate the transformations required to produce the attested surface representations of the utterance.","LexPhon allows the user to experiment with underlying forms, the structure of the rules to be applied, the ordering of the rules, their application within cyclic or noncyclic stratum control and the definitions of the segments to be manipulated. The investigative tools allow the segment definitions of the phoneme inventory to be interrogated to find groups of segments answering particular feature descriptions and to find alternative descriptions of specified groups of segments.","All the software implemented for configuring the processor, updating the databases, investigating the properties of the selected phoneme inventory and applying the processor to the phonological data has been collected into a single system which, in common with most other Prolog software, is of a hierarchical structure. In general, only the predicates at the leaves of the hierarchy perform direct actions on the data, the intermediate levels being present to select the appropriate action to be taken. The top level of the hierarchy is accessible to the user via a pull-down top-bar menu containing five sections of commands which control the application of the system. Fig. 1.

Also, if the application of a phonological rule involves a transformation upon a segment which results in the creation of a new segment not listed in the current phoneme inventory, segment descriptors may remain in the working string at the end of processing. In either of these cases, an appropriate message will be generated and the working string will be displayed in its list form in place of the phonemic transcription which results from a completely successful application of the system.","e.g."]},{"title":"Unresolved atoms in t h e final working string [wordboundary,compbounda ry,s,p,o,o,n,s,compboundary, f,u,l,compboundary,wordbou ndary]","paragraphs":["The phonological rules are applied, in numerical order, in blocks defined by the stratum definition predicates. These blocks must each contain a contiguous set of rules from the current data-base, the only restriction being that the last rule number specified must be the same as or higher than the first rule number. Thus, blocks may overlap and the rules attached to a later stratum need not be defined later than those attached to earlier strata. Although rules are applied ordinaily within each stratum, there is no requirement that a rule must be defined for every number within the range of that stratum. 3.3.1 Control Mechanisms","Cyclic and noncyclic Stratum Control Mechanisms are defined and govern the ordering of morphological affixation and phonological transformation phases for each stratum.","For cyclic application, the relevant rules for the stratum are applied to any appropriate contexts in the current working string, subject to the SCC condition which prevents application of any rule which has been marked for SCC, on this cycle, and then the appropriate morphological affixation process is invoked. For interactive use, an interface is provided to elicit and validate the data in the correct format. Data supplied from a datafile is validated and checked against the stratum information to ensure that the current stratum is an appropriate level at which to incorporate it into the word string. Following every subsequent affixation at the same stratum, the phonological rules assigned to that stratum are reapplied.","In non-cyclic strata, all affixation takes place before the associated block of phonological rules is applied, once only, to the outcome of the affixation process.","To complete the implementation of the control strategies described in the Halle and Mohanan paper, for stratum 3, the compounding level, the cyclic control mechanism has been expanded for the default model. If compounding takes place then stratum 2 is re-invoked to test for further morphological affixation before completing stratum 3 and, if this occurs, both the morphological and phonological components of stratum 2 are re-applied. In 49 the Halle and Mohanan model, the only possible morphological process at stratum 3 is compounding.","However, in order to make the system as flexible as possible, the 'hmspecial' predicate set, which controls the order of application of morphological and phonological processes, has been extended to include all types of affixation normally possible, in parallel with the normal cyclic control mechanism. Only compounding causes the loopback mechanism to be invoked even if other classes of affixation have been authorised at stratum 3. The loopback mechanism returns the current working string unchanged if no affix is found but invokes the phonological rule predicate followed by the normal 'cyclerule' predicate if affixation has been successful. This enables further affixation to take place, if necessary, cycling through stratum 2 for each affixation process.","As this is an extension to the stratum 3 affixation process, no bracket erasure takes place between the two strata during the looping process. A single application of the bracket erasure predicate is invoked only on final completion of stratum 3, i.e. when there is no further compounding and no further stratum 2 affixation to be processed. This means that all the 'new' conjunction atoms introduced at both stratum 2 and stratum 3 are available throughout this operation.","This mechanism raises many theoretical problems. However, the objective of its implementation in LexPhon was to ascertain the closest possible correspondence to the descriptions provided by Halle and Mohanan (1985) in order to explore its consequences, so it is sufficient to note here that practical demonstrations (Williams, 1993) indicate that the loopback mechanism is unnecessarily cumbersome and does not achieve the consequences predicted for it.","The Halle and Mohanan description was chosen as the default model as it is both the most complex and the most completely specified model of LP available. Other descriptions of LP were taken into account in trying to make LexPhon sufficiently flexible to be utilised in contrasting a wide variety of approaches to LP.","In addition to being a tool for developing linguistic descriptions, it is intended that the processor should itself be a model of the control structures of LP.","Although the system has not yet been applied extensively to languages other than English, one of the fundamental tenets common to the various approaches to LP is that the mechanisms which apply the rules are language independent but that the phoneme inventory, the morphological and phonological rules and the number and cyclicity of the strata are language dependent (Kiparsky, 1982; Halle and Mohanan, 1985; but see also Booij and Rubach, 1987, for universal model of stratification). The system has been developed to reflect this view with the modules which represent the phoneme inventory, the rulebase and the stratum definitions being independent and interactively changeable. This also facilitates comparisons between alternative models of the same language.","3.4 Summary of the LexPhon default model.","The default phonological interpreter is based on Halle and Mohanan's (1985) detailed description of LP which provides for a framework of five strata, four of which operate within the lexicon. The postlexical and second lexicai strata are noncyclic, all other strata being cyclic in application. Although fundamentally cyclic, stratum 3, the level at which compounding takes place, has a much more complex structure allowing for backtracking to stratum 2 under specific circumstances. LexPhon can b e reconfigured by the user to provide for potentially any number of strata, each of which must be designated as cyclic or noncyclic.","The default databases of the LexPhon system comprise the phoneme inventory containing the 42 phonemes listed above, 24 of the rules suggested by Halle and Mohanan (1985) and the five stratum model also proposed by Halle and Mohanan. Descriptions of the current state of each database can be invoked from the LexPhon system menus. The default definitions are summarised in the tables below.","The segment label /y/appears in the defailt phoneme inventory so that the Halle and Mohanan rule specifications could be matched as closely as possible for the default rule set.

SPEECH STYLE STUDY","The term \"speech style\" usually refers to intra-speaker variation although there is not as yet any consensus as to its scope (Llisterri, 1992). Definitions and categorisations may relate to the context in which the speech occurred (formal/ informal); to the task involved in producing the speech (read/descriptive/conversational); to the speed at which the speech is produced (rapid/slow); or to the amount of attention 52 believed to be directed to the speaking process (casual/careful). Stylistic variations may be restricted to prosodic, phonetic and phonemic contrasts or extend to syntax, choice of lexical items or even choice between different languages (Milroy, 1987). Thus, speech style may be seen as a single continuum along which each of the contributory factors may be ranged (Labov,"]},{"title":"1981)","paragraphs":["or as a set of distinct categories within which there can be intra-style variation (Milroy, 1987). Further, different factors can result in the same phonemic or phonetic contrasts (Kreidler, 1989).","Harris (1969) presented a study of Hispanic phonology in which he contrasted the regular variations in pronunciations which occurred, relative to the speed at which each utterance was produced. He identified four different speeds which could be characterised for the Mexico City dialect of Spanish under study. These comprised: Largo, slow and also described as overprecise; Andante, not quite so slow and considered typical of natural careful speech; Allegretto, somewhat faster and typical of natural casual speech; and Presto, extremely fast and unconstrained.","The styles are distinguished b y differences in nasal and sibilant assimilations as well as by other variants. The assimilation phenomena seem to be at least partially dependent on differences in the level of boundaries which must be specified in the phonological rules. This suggests that the level ordering of LP might enable a simpler characterisation of speech style contrast be formulated.","Although Harris defines style in terms of speech speed he assumes a direct correlation between this and the level of attention or carefulness applied to speaking. Both the amount of care taken and the degree of precision with which an utterance is formed are hypothesised to decrease with increases in the rate at which the utterances are produced. Hence, this comparison explores variations in the pronunciation of the same utterances under varying conditions of speech speed and/or carefulness. It is contrasted with a similar study of reported casual versus more careful and/or formal forms in British English."]},{"title":"4.1. The Hispaoic Study","paragraphs":["The nasal-assimilation and s-voicing rules suggested by Harris (1969) are applied to underlying forms in the context of a level-ordered LP of Spanish, together with the vowel-glide transformation rule which feeds the nasal and sibilant assimilation rules in certain contexts. Thus, certain adjustments to the Phoneme Inventory were required. In addition to language-specific differences in the phoneme inventory, Harfis's treatment of the Mexico City data explicitly rescinds the distinction between phonemic and phonetic levels. The voiced velar fricative is needed and Harris posits several additional nasal symbols to support his account. In total, he suggests three underlying nasal segments and an additional four nasal variants which appear in surface forms of the Mexico City data. 4. I. I The Hispanic Phoneme Inventory","In principle, there is no limit to the size of the phone/phoneme inventory in LexPhon. However, in the current system the feature set from which the phonemic segments are created is fixed and some processes can only operate upon Single character labels. In addition to 'coronal', 'anterior' and 'back', Harris employs the feature 'distributed' to distinguish between the Hispanic nasals. This is not currently available in LexPhon. Thus, the full set of nasal segments available for the Spanish speech study, and the features over which they vary, were as follows: Table 4: The Hispanic nasals","rn n fi q fi coronal ÷ ÷ anterior + + back - + [high ! +","where /m/,/n/ and /fi/ are the underlying nasals and/q/ and/fi/ are respectively the velar nasal and the additional '+coronal', '-anterior' nasal, hypothesised by Harris, to be present and distinct although acoustically indistinguishable from the alveolar/n/. Each of these has been allocated a single character label whose appearance in the LexPhon display font is the corresponding IPA character.","The phoneme inventory was updated first to ensure that any segments which might be required for rule definitions would be available. This is important as the rule interpreter has data validation mechanisms so that, at the time of input, all segment labels must refer to segments within the current phoneme inventory. 4.1.2 The Hispanic Rules","Since rules in cyclic strata must relate to derived forms, whereas rules in non-cyclic strata are not permitted to refer to embedded boundaries, two forms of the s-voicing and nasal-assimilation rules were derived.","The vowel-glide transformation rule must be formulated with respect to new derivation at the start of its context, so only one formis required as it is neither cross-boundary nor word-formation independent in its action and can therefore apply at any stratum. It must precede both nasal-assimilation and s-voicing, as it feeds both rules.","I I = [ -consonantal, +high, - tense] -> [-syllabic] / &_ [+syllabic].","Harris provides a series of possible definitions for the nasal assimilation rule. The rule context includes various alternative boundaries or optional boundaries at different speech speeds. Additionally, for fast speech (e.g. Allegretto), Harris requires extra constraints on the nasals to ensure that / m/ is unaffected before /n/, and to account for nasal assimilation to word-onset glides.","14 = [nasal] -> [ixcoronal,","13anterior, 1~back, 6high] /_","& [-sonorant, ixcoronal,","~anterior, ~back, fihigh]. 22 = n -> [txcoronal, 5high, - 13anterior, Kback] / _ [- 53","syllabic, o<coronal, 13high, • 3back].","Fors-voicing, Harris provides only one form which varies with speech speed, only in whether boundaries or optional boundaries need to be defined. 16 = s -> [voiced] /_ & [- syllabic, voiced].","24 = s -> [voiced] / _ [-","syllabic, voiced].","The Hispanic Rule database was formed by first selecting the \"Delete Phon Rules\" option from the top-level menu, to clear the database and then adding each of the above rule formulae interactively via the \"Add a Rule\" dialogue selected from the \"Change Phon Rules\" menu. 4.1.3 The Hispanic Data","As Harris had identified a style-dependent variation between article-noun boundaries and the boundaries between less primitive constituents, it was necessary to represent this in the data and adapt LexPhon to cope with utterance construction beyond word level. In this case, as the lowest level word boundaries involved only monomorphemic definite and indefinite articles, it was derided to treat these as an additional word-internal level and reserve the word boundary symbol to designate phrase boundaries and higher level constituent boundaries.","As the plural morpheme consistently occurs after other possible suffixes, I have assumed at least two word-internal levels. Thus, most word internal affixes were designated type 1, inflectional affixes were designated type 2, definite and indefinite articles were designated type 3 and phrase boundaries were identified by the word boundary symbol.","Three sets of data were selected to include as many cases as possible of nasal and As/ segments in contexts selected to contrast the same underlying phoneme string with different boundaries for as many different phoneme sequences as possible.","A total of 76 words or short phrases were included • in the databases tested on all five settings of the system. They were selected Io provide as many contrastive contexts as possiblc with examples for each level of boundary wherever possible. A selection of these are shown below. 54 Table 5: Examples of Hispanic data [word(s) [ underlying form"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["translation","wb,d,t,s,d,c,Wb since desdefiar wb.d¢,1.a.t.n.orl.wb to distain los dientes wb,los$,q,x,c,n,t,c,s2,wb the teeth hasta wb,h,a,|,t,a.wb dest~r wb,dts I .t,lc,§,lr I ,wb","wb,los3.l,a.g,o,s2,wb,d,¢,wb loslagos de los lagos a rancho wb,los3,I,a,g,o,s2,wb,a,wb wb,r,o,n,~,o,wb","inmenso wb,lnl,m,c,n,s,o,wb wb,a,n,k,a,wb wb.o,a,n,g,a,wb ganga","ajenjo","nieto","WbpilpN,t,fl,N~O,Wb","wb,n,ldC,t,o,wb un hielo wb,un3,x,c,i,o,wb nuevo wb,n,u,c,v,o,wb un huevo wb,un3,u,c.v.o,wb UI'I OSO wb,un3,o,s,o,wb","wb,kon l,p,a,d,r,c,wb"]},{"title":"mr, e","paragraphs":["con padre wb,kon3,p,a,d,r,c,wb until to discolour the lakes of the lakes at ranch huge haunch bargain absinth grandson a frost new an e~8 abear aquaintanee with father 4.1.4 The Control Structure","Optional boundaries are dealt with within the theory of LP by assuming that no boundary is specified in the rule and the rule is either attached to several strata (Halle and Mohanan, 1985) or to the first stratum following the resolution of all boundaries across which it may apply (Booij and Rubach, 1987). Following Booij and Rubach, I assumed that normal derivation up to word level would take place within a three stratum model consisting of cyclic, postcyclic and post lexical strata and therefore selected a five stratum model to begin the investigation (one for each level of affixation, plus one to ensure that rules could be applied after all word-formation processes were complete, including bracket erasure). The word formation processes were assigned in order with type 1 processes at stratum 1, type 2 at stratum 2, type 3 at stratum 3 and word boundaries at stratum 4.","Five contrastive settings of the model, which varied only in the assignment of phonological rules to strata, were prepared: Table 6: The Hispanic Control settings Stratum C1 C2 c3 c4 c5 1 10-16 10-16 10-16 10-16 10-16 2 25-49 20-49 II-ll I1-11 II-II 3 50-59 50-59 20-59 11-11 I1-11 4 60-69 60-69 60-69 20-69 I1-11 5 90-99 90-99 90-99 90-99 20-99","Rule-sets allocated to strata may include \"empty sets\" if no rules have been allocated to any of the rule numbers assigned 4.1.5 The Results","Results are shown examples in Table 5. for each of the Table 7: Example Results (Hispanic study) r","Cl C2/C3 dcsdE dczd~ dzzdzfior C4 Iosdzcntcs Iozdxznl¢s hasto dcstcflir Ioslagosdc Ioslagosa rondo xnmcnso imm~nso ank8 genoa ON~OHO nx~lo Unlt|O DUEUO aQka gaQQe aacQXo unuzvo Inzlagosd¢ Iozla~ose Uf~W£VO C5 Iozlagozdz unogo kompadr¢ konpadrc kompadr¢","The broad phonemic transcriptions resulting from the three data sets indicate a correspondence from the slow to fast speech with the re-assignment of the phonological rules from low to high strata. However, within this progression, the detailed analysis of the data presented by Harris demonstrates some anomalies. It is not possible to assign the settings CI-C5 to the speech styles Largo, Andante, Allegretto and Presto on a one-to-one (or even many-to-one) basis. At each level there may be forms which Harris assigns to contrasting styles. This may be partially due to the imperfect assignment of structure to the data items examined.","For the Mexico City dialect, Largo speech roughly corresponds to settings C1-C2 of the LP control system proposed here for Spanish, Andante to C2-C3, Allegretto to C4-C5 and Presto may correspond to C5. Thus, the LP model, implemented in LexPhon, appears to give a reasonably good approximation to the data available."]},{"title":"4.2. The English Study","paragraphs":["A more modest study of English style contrast data is included to examine whether similar stratum assignment of phonological rules can account for the casual/careful style contrasts found in standard British English. Again the Booij and Rubach model (1987) has been extended to investigate furlher aspects of the data through the inclusion of an additional stratum and the re-allocation of rules to strata.","Descriptions of English style contrasts tend to be less well structured than the Harris (1969) study of the Mexico City dialect. The most common contrasts applied to spontaneous utterances are between careful and casual speech or between formal and informal speech. These two styles are sometimes, but not always, assumed to correspond. In either case, study is not limited to a comparison of binary alternations but usually relates to a series of utterance forms varying from one extreme of the style to the other. Laver (1991), for example, cites seven possible utterance forms for the single word 'actually' varying from most formal to most informal style in educated Southem British English.","Kreidler (1989) lists vowel reduction, vowel loss, consonant loss and assimilation among the processes of reduction which contrast formal with informal or rapid English speech. Stress assignment is an important factor in identifying the contexts to which these apply and less formal speech may exhibit some or all of these processes. However, Kreidler suggests that apart from phonemic context, the familiarity of a particular word or phrase may also affect the amount of reduction which it may undergo. Although listing contrastive most careful and most casual forms, Kreidler too states that there may be one or more intermediate pronunciations.","The Phonological Rules and Phoneme Inventory used here are the default databases provided for LexPhon, mainly derived from Halle and Mohanan's (1985) description of LP. Four strata were derived by adding an additional noncyclic stratum to the Booij and Rubach (1987) model and again 5 contrastive settings were used in which blocks of the 24 ordered rules are progressively allocated to later strata to reflect more casual speech. The original rule-ordering is maintained throughout. Table 8: Control Settings for English Style Stratum C!

Word-internal assimilations involving y-insertion and palatalization have taken place. At the fourth setting, in which many of the noncyclic rules are attached to the final stratum and are applied after all word-formation is complete, a number of assimilations involving palatalization and y-insertion take place across word boundaries as well as word-internally.","Further variations are demonstrated between the fourth and fifth settings. At the fifth setting all post-cyclic rules operate within the final, post-word-level, stratum causing spimntization to apply to contexts spanning word-boundaries.","The variations resulting from the first three settings generally reflect a relatively formal, carefully pronounced speech style, although certain reductions characteristic of spoken rather than written English have not taken place (e.g. 'will not' rather than 'won't'). Some reductions found at the fourth setting in such partial clauses as 'unless you' and 'did you' are attested by Kreidler (1989) as casual speech forms. However, I have found no evidence in the literature for other reductions found at the fourth setting, nor for the further fricative reductions found at the fifth setting. These latter appear to be more typical of \"slurred\" speech than casual speech.","Much of the style-related variation reported by Laver and Kreidler does not occur as a result of the LexPhon settings tested above. However, the variations which they reported are characterised by phonological rules such as fricative assimilation (Kreidler, p257) and cluster reductions, not required (or not yet implemented in LexPhon) for the derivation of the standard forms of the utterances. Thus, the model provides a partial but inadequate description of careful/casual contrasts found in British English. 5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS","LexPhon, a computational framework for models of lexical phonology, has been described and an example application of one potential use of such a system has been presented.","Using LexPhon, contrastive L P structures were applied to Spanish and English data in the context of language-dependant Phoneme Inventories and Phonological Rule sets.","A hypothesis was tested that intm-speaker style variation might be the result of applying the same rules to the same underlying forms but at different stages of the utterance formation process. In the case of the Spanish data for the Mexico City dialect, allocation of rules to strata appears to account for a substantial proportion of the attested variation between the speech speed styles. For the contrastive study of English careful versus ~tsual style data, re-allocation of rules to strata appears to account for a smaller proportion of the variation attested, in spite of the use of a much more comprehensive rule set.","Although the studies presented here are not conclusivei they provide evidence which gives support to the theory that aspects of style variation may be attributable to the level of word-formation at which phonological rules are applied, rather than necessarily to differences in the formulation of the rules themselves. This supports the LP hypothesis that complex surface phonology of languages may be the result of interactions between relatively simple morphological and phonological processes taking place within a simple framework.","Further, the application of LexPhon to a problem requiring alternative phoneme inventory, phonological rulebase and LP control framework demonstrates the flexibility which the system can offer to comparative studies in lexical phonology.
