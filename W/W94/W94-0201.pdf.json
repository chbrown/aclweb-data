Birdied. ac. uk Abstract In this paper I report on an investigation into thc problem of assigning tones to pitch contours. The proposed model is intended to serve as a tool for phonologists working on instrumentally obtained pitch data from, tone languages. Motivation and exemplification for the model is provided by data taken from my fieldwork on Bamileke Dschang (Cameroon). Following recent work by Liberman and others, l provide a parametrised F0 prediction fuuction ~o which generates F0 values from a tone sequence, and I explore the asymptotic behaviour of downstel,. Next., i observe that transcribing a sequence X of pitch (i.e. F0) values amounts to findil~g a tone sequence T such that P(T) ~ X. This is a combimttorial optimisation problem, for which two non-deterministic search techniques are provi-d~d: a genetic algorithm and a simulated annea-Iblg algorithm. Finally, two implementations-- Oll,~ for each technique~are described and then co,npared using both artificial and real data for s~.quences of up to 20 tones. These programs can be adapted to other tone languages by adjusting tiw F0 predh:tion function. INTRODUCTION Tim wealth of literature on tone and intonation has amply demonstrated that voice pitch (F0) in sp,~ech is umier independent linguistic control. In English, w,h'e pitch alone can signal the distincthm bctwccu a st~ttement and a question. Similarly, in many tone languages,voice pitch alone siglmls the tense of a verb. Phonologists usually d,~scribe a pitclf contour nmch as they describe sp~ech more generally, namely as a sequence of discrete units (i,e. a transcription). This is illustrated in Figure 1, where L indicates a low tone a~Jd ~.H indicates a downstepped high tone. The question addressed in this paper concerns how we should relate pitch contours to tone sequences.","This paper is divided into four main sections, smnmarised in turn below.","Tone Transcription In this section I present the problem of relating sequences of F0 values to ton~ transcriptions. I argue that Hidden Markov Models are unsuited to the task and I demonstrate the importance of having a complltational tool which allows phonologists to experiment with F0 scaling parameters.","Fo Scaling This section gives a mathematical basis for a general approach to F0 scaling which, it is hoped, will be applicable to any tone language. I derive an F0 prediction function from first, principles and show how the model of Liberman et al. (1993) for tile Nigerian iangu:~ge Igbo is a special case.","Tone and Fo in Bamileke Dschang Here I present some data from my own fieldwork and give a statistical analysis, using the same technique used by Liberman et al. I then show how the general model of the previous section is instantiated for this language. This demonstrates the versatility of the general model, since it can be applied to two very different tone languages.","Imphunentatlons This section provides two non-deterministic techniques for transcribing an F0 string. The first method uses a genetic algorithm while the second method uses simulated annealing. The performance of both implementations is evaluated and compared on a range of artificial and real data. Finally, I give some examples of multiple, automatically-generated transcriptions of the same F0 data. TONE TRANSCRIPTION Generation and Recognition A prot nising way of generating contours from tone sequences is to specify one or more pitch targets per tone and then to interpolate between the targets; the task then becomes one of providing a suitable sequence of targets (Pierrehumbert & Beckman, 1988). It is perhaps less clear how we should go about recognising tone sequences from pitch contours.

Moreover, the same section of a pitch contour may correspond to either H or L tones. For example, a H between two Hs looks just like an L between two Ls. There is no principled upper bound on the amount of context that needs to be inspected in order to resolve the ambiguity, lea(ling to a multiplication of state information required by the HMM and problems for training it.","In the present context, the emphasis is not on automatic speech recognition but on a tool to support phonologists working with tone. As we shall see in the next section, once the phonologist has identified the salient location to measure the 'F0 value' of a syllable (or some other phonological unit), the task will be to automatically map a string of these values to a string of tones. A Tool for Phonologists Connell and Ladd have devised a set of heuristics for identifying key points in an F0 contour to record F0 values (Connell & Ladd, 1990, 21If). In the absence of a program which enshrines these heuristics, it was decided to develop a system for producing a tone transcription from a sequence of F0 values. Apart from the obvious benefits of automating the process, such as speed and accuracy, it ~'ould show up cases where there is more than one possible tone transcription, possibly with different parameter settings for the F0 scaling function. Having the set of tone transcriptions that are compatible with an utterance has consideral,le value to an analyst, searching for invariances in I.he tonal assignments to individual morphenaes.","To exemplify this point, it is worth consktering a recent example where an alternatiw~ transcription of some data proved valuable in providing a fresh analysis of the data. In their analyses of tone in Bamileke Dschang, Hyman gives tile transcription in (la) while Stewart gives the one in (lb), for the phrase meaning machete of dogs.","(1) a. flJai mSmSbhd -- (Hyman, 1985, 50) b. J~Jai't' SmSmbh6- (Stewart, 1993, 2(10) These two possibilities exist because of different F0 scaling parameters. These parameters deternfine the way in which the different tones are scaled relative to each other and to the speaker's pitch range. This is illustrated in (2), adapting Hyman's earlier notation (Hyman, 1979). (2) a. Hyman: flJli m~m,l.bhti .fl pl f mo $ mbhfi L L H L ./. It 3 3 l 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 1 3 2 b.

Immediately below the two rOWS of tOllC'S we see a row of inllnbers corresponding to the tones. For Hyman, L=3 and H=I, while for Stewart, 1,=2 and H=I. Observe in HynllUi'S example that a rising tone.--synlbolised by a wedge abow: the i .--.is modelled as all btl scquencl: in keeping with standard practice in African tone analysis.","The second row of numbers corresponds to downstep (.1.) and upstep ('1\"). For Hymart's model, this row begins at 0 and is increased by 1 for each downstep encountered. For Stewart's model, this row begins at. 1 and is increased by 1 for each downstep encountered and decreased by 1 for each upstep encountered. The two rows are summed vertically to give the last row of numbers. Observe that the last rows of Stewart's and Hyman's models are identical.","The parameter which distinguishes the two approaches is partial vs. total downstep. Hyman treats Dschang as a partial downstep language, i.e. where .I.H appears as a mid tone (with respect to the material to its left). Stewart treats it as a total downstep language, i.e. where ~H appears as an I, tone (with:respect to the material to its left).","While Hyman and Stewart present rather different analyses of rather different looking transcriptions, we can see that they are really analyzing the same data, given the above interpretation function. Therefore, phonologists who do not wish to limit themselves to the transcriptions which resuit from certain parameter settings in the phonetic interpretation function would be better off w,,rkiug directly with number sequences like the last row in (2). This paper describes a tool which lets them do just that. Fo SCALING C, onsider again the F0 contour in Figure 1. In particular, ilote that the F0 decay seems to be to a non-zero asymptote, and that H and L appear to have different asymptotes which we symbolise as h and I respectively. These observations are clearer in Figure 2, which (roughly speaking) displays the peaks and valleys from Figure 1.","Although this is admittedly a rather artificial ex:unple, it remains true that there is no princip-h,,I upper limit ou the number of downsteps that C;i.II oCcllr in an utterance (C.]eluents, 1979, 540), lul, I so the a.sytnptotic behaviour off Fll scaling still IIC,'ds I.o I)c addressed.","NOw Sul)pose tllat we have a sequence T of t(mcs where ti is the ith tone (H or L) and a sequence X of F0 values where xi is the F0 value corresponding to ti.

Then we have: xi -- l -- C","xi-x - h More generally, suppose that we have a sequence of two arbitrary tones. Ignoring the possibility of downstep for the present, we have a static two-tone system where HH and LL sequences are level and sequences like HLHLHL are realised as simple oscillation between two pitches.

Notice also that if 7~T(X) = x for all x and if f0 = t-~ then RT = 1. These results will be useful in the next section.","Finally, it is worth comparing ~ with Hyman's and Stewart's interpretation functions which were illustrated in (2). As pointed out already, Hyman's is a partial downstep model while Stewart's is a total downstep model. Partial and total downstep can be visualised as follows, where the dotted lines indicate the abstract register inside which tones are scaled, and where downstep corresponds to lowering of the register. Partial downstep Total downstep : n ....... : H - : H :. ............. Observe that for partial downstep, it. is necessary to have two downsteps before a high tone is at the level of a preceding low, while for total downstep, it is only necessary to haw, a single downstep for a high tone to be at the same level as the preceding low. We can express these observations about partial and total dowustep in the model as follows. For partial downstep, we have 'Pt.$tt4U(Z) = x while for total downste i) we have 'PL~.H(X) = x. For both of these equations we :ire forced to have h = I which does not semn to be empirically justifiable in view of the data in Figur, l. It might be argued that this indicates a flaw iu I.he model being presented here, since partial and total downstep are widely attested in the literature on tone languages. Unfortunately, it is not possible in general to provide a model for partial or total downstep which permits distinct asymptotes for It and LJ Therefore, to the extent that Figure I is typical of tone languages in having dilferent H a.d L asymptotes, one must conclude that total and partial downstep are qualitative tern,s only. Ihrwever, they may yet re-emerge in the ,nodel under a different guise, as we shall see later.","The effect of the distinction between partial and total downstep is to allow different transcriptions of the same string, as we saw in (2).

In the next section i shall investigate the phonetic interpretation of tone in Bamileke Dschang, and determine the values of R for this language.","tTo see why this is so for the case of total downstep, suppose that such a model did exist, and so I < h. Let x E [1, h), a valid F0 value for a low tone. Now, whatever interpretation function 'P' we use, wc still require that \"PL4H(X) = x by definition of total downstep, which means that there is now a high tone with a F0 value less than h. But h is tile asymptote below which no high tones should ever be realised, and so we have a contradiction.

However, rather than asking the informant to imagin,: speaking to a subject at different distances, I controlled the volume by having the informant wear headphones and played white noise from a detuned radio. Thus, I could set the informant's voice pitch by using the volume control on my radio. My hypothesis is that this technique produces more consistent volume (and hence, pitch scaling) over long utterances and may make informants less self-conscious about speaking loudly than simply asking them to imagine speaking to subjects at various distances away.

Fortunately, these figures are sufficient to determine the R values for all other pairs of tones in Barnileke Dschang.","A further observation is that Bamileke Dschang does not have downdrift, and so there is no F0 difference across HLH and LHL sequences. This is evident in Figure 5. Therefore, we can write PHLH(X) = X, and by a result we showed above, RHL.RLH = 1.

This raises an interesting question. Suppose we have two tone sequences T = t0...t, and 7 '~ = t~...t~, and two interpretation functions \"it:' and P' based on R and R ~ respectively. Then under what circumstances is the phonetic interpretation of both sequences the same under their respective interpretation fimc-tions?

A possible characterisation of total vs. partial downstep now arises: if RHL = 1 then we have total downstep, but if RHL = d < 1 then we have partial downstep. However, the interpretation of these terms must necessarily be different from the standard interpretation, since I have shown that the standard interpretation is not compatible with the present model.","This concludes the discussion of F0 scaling in Bamileke Dschang.

In what follows, I explain some of the I)arameters of annealing search as used in the curreut implementation.","temperature At the start of the search the temperature, t is set to 1. During the search, the temperature is reduced at a rate set by the 'cocrling rate' parameter, until it reaches a valne loss than 10 -Â¢ .","perturbation At each step of the search, the cu r-rent state is perturbed by an amount which depends on the temperature. The temperature determines the fraction of the search space that is covered by a single perturbation step.

If the energy difference A between an old and a new state is less than the available energy, then the transition is accepted.

The ou-ter loop simply iterates through the temperature range, beginning with a temperature of 1 and steadily decreasing it until it gets very close to zero. The nested loop performs the task of reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature. The first step is to perturb the previous transcription to make a new one. Notice that the temperature t is a parameter of the perturb function. Next, the difference £x between the old and new evaluations is calculated. If the new transcription has a better evaluation than the old one, then £x is negative. Next, the program accepts the new transcription if (i) A is negative or (ii) A is positive and there is sufficient free energy in the system to allow the worse transcription to be accepted. Finally, we check if the new transcription is better than the best transcription found so far (BestTrans) and if so, we set BestTrans to be the new transcription. Once equilibrium is reached, the current transcription is set to be the best transcription found so far, and the search continues. Performance Results Both the genetic and annealing search algorithms have been implemented in CA-+. In this section, the performance of the two implementations is compared. Performance statistics are based on 1,200 exe-100 80 60 40 20 5 10 15 20 Figure 6: Performance results (no upstep) cutions of each program. Search parameters were set so that each execution took around 5 seconds on a Sun Sparc 10. Three performance trials were undertaken.","Trial 1: Artificial Data. In the first trial, both programs generated random sequences of tones, then computed the corresponding F0 sequence using P, then set about transcribing the F0 sequence. Since these sequences were ideal, the best possible evaluation for a transcription was zero. The performance of the programs could then be measured to see how close they came to finding the optimal solution. Each program was tested on F0 sequences of length 5, 10, 15 and 20. For each length, each program transcribed 100 randomly-generated sequences. The results are displayed in Figure 6. Each pair of bars corresponds to a given transcription length. The left member of each pair is for the genetic search program, while the right member is for the annealing search program.","The heavily shaded bars corresponding to evaluations less than 1 are the most important. These indicate the number of times out of 100 that the programs found a transcription with an evaluation less than 1. This evaluation means that the average of the squared difference between the predicted F0 values and the actual F0 values was less than 1Hz. Observe that the annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases. Note that the mutation operation in the genetic search program treats each bit in the parameter encodings equally, while the perturbation operation in the annealing search program is sensitive to the distinction between more significant vs. less significant bits. This may explain the better convergence behaviour of the annealing search.","Notice also in Figure 6 that performance"]},{"title":"lOOL • <o., [] <,","paragraphs":["[] <10 [] <100 100I • <4 [] <7 [] <10 [] <20 80 80 60 60 40 40 20 20 5 10 15 20 Figure 7: Performance results (upstep) 1 2 3 4 Figure 8: Performance results for actual data does not degrade with transcription length as the length doubles from 10 to 20. This is probably because a randomly generated sequence will contain downsteps on every second tone (on average) causing a general downtrend in the F0 values and severely limiting the combinatorial explosion of possible transcriptions. Trial 2: Artificial Data with Upstep. Trial 2 was the same as trial 1 except that this time upstep was permitted as well. The results are displayed in Figure 7. Again the annealing program fares better than the genetic program. Consider again the bars corresponding to evaluations less than 1. For both programs, however, observe that the performance degrades more uniformly than in trial 1, probably because the inclusion of upstep greatly increases the number of possible transcriptions (and hence, the number of local optima). Trial 3: Actual Data. The final trial involved real data, including data from the utterance given in Figure 1. This trial involved four subtrials. The first and second had F0 sequences of length 10, while the third and fourth had length 18 and 19. The first and second sequences were taken by extracting the initial 10 F0 values from the third and fourth sequences, thereby avoiding the asymptotic behaviour of the longer sequences. The data is tabulated below, and it comes from the sentences in (5).","Trial F0 sequence","1 219,168,183,150,160,136,144,123,131,I 15","2 205,224,16'7,200,156,175,136,156,127,140","3 219,168,183,150,160,136,144,123,131,115,","122,107,113,105,118,100,113,95","4 205,224,167,200,156,175,136,156,127,140,","118,129,109,119,103,120,102,111,95 Performance results are given in Figure 8.

I provided an F0 prediction function 'P which estimated the F0 value of a tone, given the F0 value of the previous tone a.nd the identities of the two tones. I presented instrumental data from Bamileke Dschang and showed how the function could be specialised for this language. The function was then incorporated into the evaluation functions of two implement~,d non-deterministic search algorithms. The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate the proraise of automated tone transcription.
