It can denote a possessive relationship, as in, I had a car, or endow a quality, as in, I had anxiety. Further, have can describe an act of creation, as in, I had a baby, or an undertaking, as in, I had lunch. Broadly, all uses of have either denote a state, i.e., a situation that is not dynamic, or an event, i.e., a dynamic occurrence that entails change or activity. This semantic distinction, stativity, is fundamental to many domainR, e.g., distinguishing symptoms and diagnoses from procedures in the medical domain.","Stativity is the first distinction for the semantic hierarchy of verb phrases known as aspect. This hierarchy is linguistically established to enable reason-ing about time, i.e., temporal reasoning. Aspectual classification further distinguishes events according to completedness (i.e., telicity), which determines whether an event reaches a culmination point in time at which a new state is introduced. For example, I made a fire is culminated, whereas, I gazed at the sunset is non-culminated.","Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain language interpretation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks. Aspectual classification is a diflqcult problem because many verbs, like have, are aspectually ambiguous.","In this paper, I demonstrate that verbs can be disambiguated according to aspect by the semantic category of the direct object. To this end, WordNet, the largest publicly available on-line lexical database (Miller et al., 1993), is used to provide semantic categories for direct objects. When applied over a corpus of medical reports, I show that WordNet categories correlate with aspectual class. Furthermore, I develop a rule for aspectual classification by the WordNet category of the direct object. This rule is specialized for the verb have, which presents a more prevalent disambiguation problem in medical reports than any other verb. The design of this rule is guided by both linguistic and statistical analysis. The rule is evaluated over an unrestricted set of nouns. WordNet categories are also shown to improve a system that performs aspectual classification with linguistically-based numerical indicators.","The following section further discusses the semantic entailments of aspect and Section 3 discusses the problem of aspectual ambiguity. Section 4 describes the corpus used for this study, and Section 5 describes our approach to disambiguating have. Section 6 then evaluates this approach and Section 7 describes the use of WordNet for linguistic indicators. Finally, Section 8 provides conclusions and describes future work."]},{"title":"2 Aspect in Natural Language","paragraphs":["Aspectual classification is a key component of models that assess temporal constraints between clauses (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1991; Dorr, 1992; Hitzeman et al., 1994).

For example, shaw denotes a state in, H/$ lumbar puncture showed evidence of white cells, but denotes an event in, He showed me the photographs. This ambiguity presents a di~culty for automatically classifying a verb because the aspectual class of a clause is a function of several clausal constituents in addition to the main verb (Dowry, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Pustejovsky, 1991).

In the medical domain, have occurs as the main verb of clauses frequently (8% of clauses) and is aspectually ambiguous, occurring 69.9% of the time as a state, and 30.1% of the time as an event. Most other ambiguous verbs are more highly dominated by one sense in this domain (Siegel, 1998).","In this section, I examine factors contributing to aspectual ambiguity. First, I exam the interaction between a verb and its arguments in determining aspectual class. The semantic category of open class words plays a large role in this process. And second, I describe a semantic hierarchy of statively ambiguous verb. This hierarchy groups together verbs that tend to interact with their arguments in similar ways. 3.1 How Clausal Constituents Contribute","to Aspectual Class The presence, syntactic categories, lexical heads, and plurality of a verb's arguments influence aspectual class. This is illustrated in Table 2, which shows example clausal features that influence aspectual class. The effect of each feature is illustrated by showing two similar sentences with distinct aspectual classes.","The number of ways in which clausal constituents interactively influence aspect is ,mknown. However, syntax alone is not sufficient, and the lexical head of multiple constituents (e.g., the verb phrase and the direct object) are often factors.

This is because many verbs with related meanings combine with their arguments in similar ways. In general, there is a correlation between a verb's subcategorization frame and semantic class (Levin, 1993), and this applies to aspect in particular.","For example, look and weigh can each appear as events, e.g.,","I looked at the baby. (event)","I we/ghed the baby. (event) and can also appear as states, as in,","The baby ~ heavy. (state)","The baby weighed a lot.

As a linguistic test for marking, each clause was tested for readability with, What happened was... In a separate study, a comparison between two human markers using this test to classify clauses over all verbs showed an agreement of approximately 91% (Siegel, 1998). The marked clauses, divided equally into training and testing sets of 103 clauses each, were used to develop and evaluate our approach, respectively. 5 Applying WordNet I have manually designed a rule for classifying have-clauses according to stativity by the WordNet category of the direct object. To design this rule, the following were observed: • Distributions of objects of have over the corpus. • Linguistic intuition regarding WordNet cate-","gories and aspectual class.","• Correlations between the WordNet category of the direct object and stativity over the supervised training data.","To accumulate this information, WordNet was queried for each direct object of the parsed corpus. In particular, each noun was placed into one of the 25 categories at the top of WordNet's semantic hierarchy, listed in Table 4. Many nouns have multiple entries corresponding to multiple senses. As an initial approach, we take the first WordNet category listed, i.e., the most f~equent sense. Pronouns such as him and it were assigned their own category, pronoun.","As shown, in Table 5, the most frequent objects of have are primarily specific to the medical domain. This table shows the high level semantic category assigned by WordNet and the classification of have-clauses with each noun as a direct object. WordNet is able to handle this technical domain since 89.1% of have-clauses have direct objects that are widely-known medical terms and non-technical terms.","The rule shown in Table 6 classifies have-clauses based on the semantic category of their direct object. In particular, clauses with direct objects that belong to the categories event, act, phenomenon, communication, possession and food are classified as events, and all others are classified as states.","Linguistic insights guided the design of this rule. For example, if the direct object of have denotes an event, such as seizure, the clause describes an event. For this reason, it is clear why the WordNet categories event, act, phenomenon and communication each indicate an event clause.

This difference in recall is more dramatic than the accuracy improvement because of the dominance of stative clauses in the test set. A favorable tradeoff in recall with no loss in accuracy presents an advantage for applications that weigh the identification of nondominant instances more heavily (Cardie and Howe, 1997). For example, it is advantageous for a medical system that identifies medical procedures to identify event clauses, since procedures are a type of event.","There are several problematic cases that illustrate limitations to our approach. In particular, lexical ambiguity is mi.qleading for the task of classifying have-clauses. For example, The paticnt had Med/c~/d denotes a state, but WordNet categorizes Med/ca/d as an act. Similarly, PET, EMUand CATare categorized as animal, as shown in Table 6. This would be solved by recognizing these as proper nouns or acronyms due to capitalization. However, other ambiguous objects are more difficult to address. For e~Ample, The patient had an enema describes an event, but WordNet lists enema as artifacl; be-fore act. As another example, The patient had a urine culture is an event, but WordNet's first sense of cu/tuw is group. Furthermore, the direct object of 10.9% of have-clauses in the medical reports are un-known to WordNet (\"N/A\").

Therefore, it is necessary to produce a specialized lexicon for each domain.","One statistical approach is to measure linguistic indicators over a corpus (Siegel, 1998). These indicators measure how frequently each verb appears with markers such as those in Table 1. For example, a verb that appears more frequently in the progressive is more likely to describe an event than a state (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992). However, this approach attempts to classif T verbs independent of their context.","Incorporating additional constituents of a clause could alleviate this problem.
