Preliminaries: the Corpora, Classification Tasks, and Learning Algorithm","paragraphs":["The classification tasks used in this study are drawn from three different corpora: Reuters-21578, USENET, and the Digital Tradition (DigiTrad). Both Reuters and USENET have been the subject of previous studies in machine learning (see [Koller & Sahami 97] for a study of Reuters and [Weiss et al. 96] for a study of USENET). In keeping with previous studies, we used topic headings as the basis for the Reuters classification tasks and newsgroup names as the basis for the USENET tasks. The third corpus, DigiTrad is a public domain collection of 6500 folk song lyrics [Greenhaus 96]. To aid searching, the owners of DigiTrad have assigned to each song one or more key words from a fixed list. Some of these key words capture information on the origin or style of the songs (e.g. \"Irish\" or \"British\") while others relate to subject matter (e.g. \"murder\" or \"marriage\"). The latter type of key words served as the basis for the classification tasks in this study. Not all types of text are equally difficult to classify. Reuters consists of articles written purely as a source of factual information. The writing style tends to be direct and to the point, and uses a restricted vocabulary to aid quick comprehension. It has been observed that the topic headings in Reuters tend to consist of words that appear frequently in the text, and this observation has been exploited to help improve classification accuracy [Rodtguez et al. 97]. DigiTrad and USENET are good examples of the opposite extreme. The texts in DigiTrad make heavy use of metaphoric, rhyming, unusual and archaic language. Often the lyrics do not explicitly state what a song is about. Contributors to USENET often vary in their use of terminology, stray from the topic, or"]},{"title":"46","paragraphs":["use unusual language. All of these qualities tend to make subject-based classification tasks from DigiTrad and USENET more difficult than those of a comparable size from Reuters. From the three corpora described above, six binary classification tasks were defined, as shown in table 1. The tasks were chosen to be roughly the same size, and cover cases in which the classes seemed to be semantically related (REUTER2 and USENET2) as well as those in which the classes seemed unrelated (REUTER1 and USENETI). In all cases the classes were made completely disjoint by removing any overlapping examples, t The machine learning algorithm chosen for this study was Ripper, a rule-based learner developed by William Cohen [Cohen 95]. Ripper was specifically designed to handle the high dimensionality of bag-of-words text classification by being fast and using set-valued features [Cohen 96]. Table 1 shows that our intuitions about the difficulty of the three corpora for bag-of-words classification are valid in the case of the Ripper algorithm. Error rates over lO.fold cross-validation 2 for the Reuters tasks were under 5%, while error rates for the other tasks ranged from approximately 19% to 38%. We believe that with the growing applications of text classification on the Internet, it is likely that the kinds of texts to be automatically classified will share many features with the kinds of texts that are difficult for the bag-of-words approach. It is worth noting that difficult classification tasks for Ripper are not necessarily difficult for humans. We classified 200 examples from each of the SONGI and SONG2 by hand (with no special training phase) and compared our classifications to those from DigiTrad. i USENET articles that were cross-posted or tagged as follow-ups were excluded so that the remaining articles reflected a wide variety of attempts to launch discussions within the given topics. Non-text objects such as uuencoded bitmaps were also removed from the postings. z In n-foM cross-validation the articles in the corpus are split into n partitions. Then the learning algorithm is executed n times. On the k ~h run, partition k is used as a testing set and all the other partitions make up the training set. The mean error-rate (percentage of the testing set wrongly classified) on the n runs is taken as an approximate measure of the real error-rate of the system on the given corpus."]},{"title":"I I I I I I","paragraphs":["Task Name REUTERI REUTER2","SONGI","SONG2 USENET1 USENET2 Source","Reuters-21578","Reuters-21578 Di[[iTrad Di[iTrad USENET USENET Table 1: Information on the class~","Classes Size Balance Words Error","livestock I ~old 224 98/126 154 1.75","corn I wheat 313 1301183 173 3.87 murder I marriage 424 2001224 331 30.23 politicall religion 432 1941238 241 32.64","soc.history 249 791170 166 19.92 misc. taxes, moderated bionet.microbiology 280 1171163 152 37.86 bionet.neuroscience ication tasks discussed in this paper. \"Size\" refers to total number","of texts in each task. \"Balance\" shows number of examples in each class. \"Words\" shows the","average length of the documents in each task. \"Error\" show the average percentage error rates for","each task using Ripper with bag-of-words and lO-fold cross-validation.

Clearly the background knowledge and linguistic competence humans bring to a classification task enables us to overcome the difficulties posed by the text itself. 3. The Hypernym Density Representation The algorithm for computing hypernym density requires three passes through the corpus. a) During the first pass, the Brill tagger [Brill 92] assigns a part of speech tag to each word in the corpus. b) During the second pass, all nouns and verbs are looked up in WordNet and a global list of all synonym and hypernym synsets is assembled. Infrequently occurring synsets are discarded, and those that remain form the feature set. (A synset is defined as infrequent if its frequency of occurrence over the entire corpus is less than 0.05N, where N is the number of documents in the corpus.) c) During the third pass, the density of each synset (defined as the number of occurrences of a synset in the WordNet output divided by the number of words in the document) is computed for each example resulting in a set of numerical feature vectors. The calculations of frequency and density are influenced by the value of a parameter h that controls the height of generalization. This parameter can be used to limit the number of steps upward through the hypernym hierarchy for each word. At height h=O only the synsets that contain the words in the corpus will be counted. At height h>O the same synsets will be counted as well as all the hypernym synsets that appear up to h steps above them in the hypernym hierarchy. A special value of h=max is defined as the level in which all hypernym synsets are counted, no matter how far up in the hierarchy they appear. In the new representation, each feature represents a set of either nouns or verbs. At h=max, features corresponding to synsets higher up in the hypernym hierarchy represent supersets of the nouns or verbs represented by the less general features. At lower values of h, the nouns and verbs represented by a feature (synset) will be those that map to synsets up to h steps below it in the hypernym hierarchy. The best value of h for a given text classification task will depend on characteristics of the text such as use of terminology, similarity of topics, and breadth of topics. It will also depend on the characteristics of WordNet itself. In general, if the value for h is too small, the learner will be unable to generalize effectively. If the value for h is too large, the learner will suffer from overgeneralization because of the overlap between the features. Note that no attempt is made at word sense disambiguation during the computation of hypernym density. Instead all senses returned by WordNet are judged equally likely to be correct, and all of them are included in the feature set. The use of the density measurement is an attempt to capture some measure of relevancy. The learner is aided by the fact that many different but synonymous or hyponymous words will map to common synsets, thus raising the densities of the \"more relevant\" synsets. In other words, a relatively low value for a feature indicates that little evidence was found for the meaningfulness of that synset to the document. (In the [Rodrfguez et al. 97] text classification paper, word sense disambiguation was performed by manual inspection. This approach was feasible in the context"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["47 of that study because of the small number of words involved. In the current study, the words number in the tens of thousands, making manual disambiguation unfeasible. Automatic disambiguation is possible and often obtains good results as in [Yarowski 95] or [Li et al. 95], but this is left as future work.) Clearly the change of representation process leaves a lot of room for inaccuracies to be introduced to the feature set. Some sources of potential error are: a) the tagger, b) the lack of true word sense disambiguation, c) words missing from WordNet, and d) the shallowness of WordNet's semantic hierarchy in some knowledge domains."]},{"title":"4. Experiments and results 4.1. Accuracy","paragraphs":["The new hypernym density representation differs in three important ways from the bag-of-words: a) all words are discarded except nouns and verbs, b) filtered normalized density vectors replace binary vectors, and c) hypernym synsets replace words. To show convincingly that improvements in accuracy are derived solely from the use of synsets, two normalizing experiments were performed using the following representations: a) bag-of-words using only nouns and verbs, and b) filtered normalized density vectors for nouns and verbs. The results of these runs were compared to the bag-of-words approach using 10-fold cross-validation (see table 2) and in no case was any statistically significant difference found, leading to the conclusion that any improvements in accuracy derive mainly from the use of hypernyms. For the main experiments, average error rates over 10-fold cross-validation were compared for all six classification tasks using hypernym density representations with values of h ranging from 0 to 9 and h--max. For each classification task the same 10 partitions were used on every run so the results could be tested for significance using a paired-t test. Table 3 shows a comparison of three error rates: bag-of-words, hypemym density with h=max, and finally hypernym density using the best value for h. In the case of the Reuters tasks, no improvements over bag-of-words were expected and none were observed.

Rule induction systems like Ripper are known for producing more comprehensible output than, say multi-layer perceptrons. A systematic investigation of the comprehensibility of rules produced using hypernym density versus bag-of-words is beyond the scope of this work. However, we often see evidence of the better comprehensibility of the rules produced from the hypernym density representation. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the rules learned by Ripper on the USENETI data set. The results for both bag-of-words and h=max hypernym density are shown for the same fold of data.

For the remaining three folds, the possession hypernym appeared along with other synsets in slightly different rules. The hyponyms of possession include words such as ownership, asset, and liability - the sorts of words often used during discussions about taxes, but rarely during discussions about history. On the other hand, the rules learned on the bag-of-words data seem less comprehensible: they are more elaborate and less semantically clear. Furthermore, the rules tended to vary widely across the 10 folds, suggesting that they were less robust and more dependent on the specifics of the training data. 4.3 Discussion Hypernym density has been observed to greatly improve classification accuracy in some cases, while in others the improvements are not particularly spectacular. In the case of the Reuters tasks, the lack of improvement is not a particular worry. It is very unlikely that any change of representation could have improved on the accuracy of bag-of-words for these tasks. But the cases of the SONG2 and USENET2 tasks are worth looking at in more detail. In the SONG2 task, the main problem seems to be that the classes (political and religion) are more closely semantically related than their class labels suggest. Visual inspection of these songs revealed that many of the political songs contain statements about religion, make references to religious concepts, or frame their messages in religious terminology. 49 This was the source of the higher error rate reported in section 2 when these songs were classified by hand. Inspection of Ripper's output revealed that bag-of-words rules make heavy use of religious words such as Jesus, lord, and soul, while the hypernym density rules at h=max mostly contained highly abstract political synsets such as social group and political unit. It is possible that overgeneralization occurred when subtle differences in religious terminology (for instance between gospel hymns and political parodies of religion) were mapped to common synsets in WordNet. In the case of USENET2 the problem is two-fold. The classes are semantically closely related (microbiology and neuroscience) and the writers tend to use highly technical terms that are not found in WordNet 1.5. Some examples of missing words include neuroscientist, haemocytometer, HIV, kinase, neurobiology, and retrovirus 3. An attempt was made to add the missing words manually into the WordNet hierarchy, but even then the extended semantic hierarchy was not fine-grained enough to allow meaningful generalizations. Because of the shallowness of the hierarchy, overgeneralization quickly becomes a problem as the height of generalization increases. This is why the best error rate for USENET2 using hypernym density was found at h=2. Clearly the change of representation to hypernym density works best only with an appropriate value for the parameter h. We have introduced a new parameter into the learning task that must somehow be set by the user. This is certainly not unheard of in the machine learning community. All currently available machine learning systems contain a large number of parameters. The only difference is that h modifies the feature set rather than the learning algorithm itself. Nevertheless, it is worth addressing the question of how this parameter could be set in practice. [Kohavi & John 95] describe a \"wrapper\" method for learning algorithms that automatically selects appropriate parameters. In their system, the set of parameters is treated as a vector space that can be searched for an optimal setting. The sets of parameters are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on the training data, and a best-first search strategy is employed to search for the parameter set that minimizes the average error rate. This system 3 Some of these terms do appear in WordNet 1.6"]},{"title":"I I i i I I i i I i I","paragraphs":["could easily be adapted to include a parameter such as h that modifies the feature set.

It is not likely to work well for text that is guaranteed to be written concisely and efficiently, such as the text in Reuters-21578. In particular, hypernym density is more likely to perform well on classification tasks involving narrowly defined and/or semantically distant classes (such as SONGI and USENETI).
