Recently, we conducted several experiments aimed at comparing various methods of incorporating a cross-linguistic capability to existing information retrieval (IR) systems. Our results indicate that translating queries with off-the-shelf machine translation systems can result in relatively good performance. But the results also indicate that other methods can perfonn even better. More specifically, we tested a probabilistic translation model of the kind proposed by Brown & al. [2]. The parameters of that system had been estimated automatically on a different, unrelated, corpus of parallel texts. After we augmented it with a small bilingual dictionary, this probabilistic translation model outperformed machine translation systems on our cross-language IR task. 1. Introduction Adequate text processing systems have become widely available for most natural languages. While English remains the dominant language on the Intemet, the relative share of other languages now appears to be on the rise. The network has become truly multilingual. This situation has created an acute need for tools capable of performing language-sensitive search in multilingual databases. In particular, there is a need for tools capable of performing cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), that is, of matching an information query written in one particular language with documents that may be written in one or several different languages. Given such a need, the solution that immediately comes to mind is to translate the information query using a machine translation (MT) system, and to feed the resulting translation into a classical monolingual IR system. However, it should be stressed that MT and IR have widely divergent concerns. First, observe that MT systems are expected to produce syntactically correct translations and that they tend to spend a lot of effort trying to attain that rather elusive goal. On the other hand, current IR systems tend not to care about grammar : for them texts are mostly viewed as vectors of content words. Second, note that MT systems are expected to select one of the many translations that words may have. For example, in translating the English word \"organic\" the MT process will be led to select between the French words \"organique\" and\"biologique\". Generally speaking, this selection process is very difficult and MT systems often end up selecting the wrong target language equivalent. Here again what the MT system is expected to do turns out to be unnecessary and maybe undesirable from an IR point of view. As a case in point, classical IR systems often perform a"]},{"title":"query expansion","paragraphs":["process by which certain query terms/words are mapped onto several equivalent or related index terms. Not surprisingly, such a process could well make provision for mapping the query word \"organique\" onto the two index terms \"organique\" and \"biologique\" so as to account for (partial) synonymy between these words. In other words, MT systems attempt to systematically eradicate translational ambiguity instead of taking advantage of it to capture synonymy relations. At the opposite end of the spectrum, MT is replaced with a simple bilingual dictionary lookup. To that end, one can use either an ordinary general-purpose dictionary, a technical terminology database, or both. Because of the fact that in any sizable dictionary most words receive many 18 translations, the dictionary approach will in effect subject the query to a rather massive expansion process. The resulting target language query is likely engender a lot of noise (irrelevant documents that get retrieved), mostly due to the fact that in each dictionary entry some of the translations can correspond to different meanings of the source language word. For example, the English word \"drug\" is translated in French as \"drogue\" (an illegal substance) or as \"mgdicament\" (a legal medicine) depending on the context. There is most often no explicit clue in the query that would allow one to choose the appropriate meaning. Yet another approach is to determine translational equivalence automatically, on the basis of a corpus of parallel texts (that is, a corpus made up of source texts and their translations). One way of doing this is to start by establishing translation correspondences between units larger than words, typically sentences. There are now well-known methods for aligning the sentences of parallel corpora (Gale & Church [6], Simard, Foster 8~ Isabelle [10]). Then, the translational equivalence of a given pair of words can be estimated by their degree of co-occurrence in parallel sentences. Compared to the previous approaches, this has the following advantages: - There is no need to acquire or to compile a","bilingual dictionary or a complete MT","system. - Word translations are made sensitive to the","domain, as embodied by the training corpus. - As we will see below, it is relatively easy to","obtain a suitable degree of query expansion","based on translational ambiguity. In the next section, we describe the structure of a probabilistic translation model that can calculate pule), the probability of observing wordfj as part of the translation of sentence e. Given a query e, we can then select the n best-scoring values offj as the set of index terms in the target language. This method will be compared to the other two mentioned above."]},{"title":"2. A Probabilistie Translation Model","paragraphs":["Any source language input e can usually be translated in a great many different ways. Machine translation systems are expected to select but one particular translation f for each input. In the current state of the art, unaided MT is generally unable to produce high-quality translations: human translators remain mostly unchallenged. Moreover, it has been shown repeatedly that human translators seldom find it practical to post-edit MT output: the machine has just made too many wrong or questionable decisions. If the goal is to help human translators, it is advisable to stop short of producing a full-blown automatic translation. There is no point in having the machine spontaneously propose a detailed target language syntactic structure unless there is at least a reasonably good chance that the translator will want to use it. Similarly, there is no point in having the machine select target language equivalents for all source language words unless most of these equivalents are likely to be retained by the translator. In recent years it has been shown that existing MT techniques can produce useful results when they are applied to tasks that amount to somewhat less than translation proper. In previous work, we have shown that probabilistic translation models such as those of Brown et al. [2] could be used as the key component of various translation support tools. Specifically, our work on the TransTalk project [1, 4] has established that such models could become instrumental in improving the process of automatically transcribing a spoken translation. And our ongoing work on the TransType project [5] indicates that models of the same kind can drive typing aids for translators. A key feature of such applications is that they do not expect the machine to volunteer a fullfledged translation on its own. Rather, the machine is only expected to restrict the range of possible translations so as to make it easier to guess what the intentions of the human translator are. Â• For example, in certain incarnations of the TransTalk system, the translation model is used as a means of answering the following question: given a source language sentence e, what is the likelihood of observing the word f in any target language sentence f that constitutes a valid translation of e? If e is an English sentence that contains the word \"horses\", then the likelihood that \"chevaux\" (the most direct equivalent for \"horses\") will appear in a French translation ff of e is much 19 greater than the a priori likelihood of observing \"chevaux\" in a random French sentence. In contrast, there is no reason to expect that the likelihood of observing \"cheveux\" (an acoustically close word that means \"hair\") in f will be significantly altered: p(chevaux E f I horses ~ e) > p(chevaux ~ f) p(cheveu x ~ f I horses ~ e) =p(cheveux ~ f) TransTalk makes use of this fact to help resolve the acoustic ambiguity between t]he French words \"chevaux'\" and \"cheveux\". From the point of view of translation support, doing somewhat less than full-blown MT is likely to achieve more. In this paper, we want to argue that CLIR is facing a similar situation in that subjecting the source language query to a process that stops short of producing a full-blown target language query can result in a good retrieval performance. For the purpose of CLIR, our goal is to obtain a set of words that are the best translations of an original query. This goal may be achieved by using probabilistic translation models of the kind used in our TransTalk and TransSearch. By translation model, we mean a mechanism which associates to each source language sentence(or query) e a probability distribution p(fle) on the sentences (or queries) f of the target language. A precise description of a family of such models can be found in Brown & al. [2]. The model we will be using for the experiments reported here is basically their \"Model 1\". In this model, a source e and !its translation f are connected through an alignment a, that is a mapping of the words of e onto those of f. If e = e 1, e r .... e t and f =.f, f2, .... f. then aj will be used to refer to the particular position in e that is connected with position j in f (for example, a 2 = 4 expresses the fact thatf~ is connected with e,) and e, will be used to refer to the word in e at position a r The probability p(fle) is decomposed as a sum over all possible alignments:"]},{"title":"p(fle) = ~a~ Ap(f, ale)","paragraphs":["The conditional probability of f under alignment a given e can be analysed as follows:","p(f, ale)= p(fla,e)p(ale) = Ke,r p(fla,e) The latter equality stems from the fact that in model 1, all alignments are considered equiprobable (see below). Consequently p(ale) is a"]},{"title":"constant Kel","paragraphs":["equal to 1 over the total number of alignements.

In other words, the probability of observing a particular word in a given position in f is established as the total of the lexical contributions of each word of e. The parameters of our translation model are estimated from a bilingual parallel corpus in which each sentence has been aligned with the corresponding sentence(s) of the other language. Such alignments can be produced using algorithms such as the one described in [10]. Given such alignments we can estimate reasonable values for the parameters t(~le) using the Expectation Maximization algorithm, as described in [2]. The model used in the experiments reported here has been trained using 8 years of the Canadian Hansard (parliamentary debates), that is, approximately 50 million words in each language. Obviously, a translation model in which all alignments are considered equiprobable, like Model 1, can only be a very coarse model. The lexical translation probabilities t~le) are independent from the positions offj and e i. As a result, for any j, j', the model assigns the 20 same value to p~le) and to pf~.le). In other words, the model is completely blind to syntax. This means that it is much too weak to generate full-blown translations on its own. At the very least, one would need to use it in tandem with a language model p(f) capable of capturing some constraints on acceptable sequences of words in the target language. Notwithstanding its weaknesses Model 1 does capture some non trivial aspects of the translation relationship as we observe it across natural languages. For example, it is indeed a property of that model that a relatively unambiguous source language word (say, the English \"chimney\") will reinforce its equivalents in a stronger way than a very ambiguous word. An ambiguous word like \"drug\" will reinforce each of its equivalents (\"mrdicament\" and \"drogue\") according to a translation probability estimated from the training corpus. While the model only operates at the level of simple word (as opposed to complex terms), it should be observed that it nonetheless captures some non-trivial contextual effects. For example, if the training corpus contains many occurrences of the expression \"drug traffic\" translated as \"trafic de drogue\", the presence of the English word \"traffic\" will thereafter tend to reinforce the French word \"drogue\" (in this instance, more than the French word \"mrdicament\"). And given the fact that the intended application is not MT but CLIR, the use of a \"weak\" translation model turns out to be, in some respects, sufficient. In our IR system queries and documents are reperesented as vectors of weighted terms. Given any query e, our translation model will calculate a value for p(t~le), the probability of observing wordfj in the translation of e. It turns out to be straightforward to reinterpret this probability distribution as a vector of weighted terms.- 3. Cross-Language"]},{"title":"information","paragraphs":["retrieval After a brief description of the principal functions of an IR system, we report our experiments on CLIR. 3.1. The tasks of an IR system An IR system performs three main tasks [9] : Â• document indexing Â• query indexing Â• matching the query and the documents Document indexing creates an internal representation (for example, a vector) for each document. Before indexing can be accomplished. We proceed the following preprocessing:","Morphological analysis: each word is transformed into a canonical, citation form. For example, nouns and (French) adjectives are transformed into their masculine singular form, and verbs are transformed into their infinitive forms. This neutralization of irrelevant differences in form often reduces retrieval silence. - Elimination of grammatical words: words that are more or less semantically empty are useless for IR. Such words are eliminated in order to reduce the size of the index and speed up the search process. For the indexing process, each document is represented as a set or a vector of weighted terms (words in canonical form). Term weight is determined by the following two factors: Â• ((term frequency): the relative frequency of the term in the document; and Â• idf(inverse document frequency): a measure of the non uniformity of the distribution of term across documents of the collection. The terms that rank best within a document d are those that are at the same time frequent within d and distributed unevenly in the collection of documents. The tt'*idf weigthing schema combines these two criteria [3, 9].

Experiments Our experiments are conducted on a French corpus used in TREC-6 (Text Retrieval Conference) [8]. The corpus contains a collection of articles from a Swiss newspaper - SDA (Schweizerische Depeschen Agentur) - French edition, published between 1988 and 1990. There are 141,656 documents, for a total size of 87 megabytes. TREC-6 data includes 25 queries, each written in English, French and German versions. Manual evaluations for 22 of these have been made available by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Our evaluations are based on this data: the French documents and the French and English queries. We compared five different approaches: 1. Monolingual French query-French documents IR. This is not CLIR, but is used as a reference point with which CLIR performance is compared. In the other approaches, the English query is translated into a French query using various tools. The translated queries are then used to retrieve French documents in the same way as in monolingual IR. We tested the following translation approaches : 2. Using MT systems (two of them: LOGOS and SYSTRAN) ; 3. Using a bilingual dictionary only; 4. Using a probabilistic translation model; 5. Combining 3 and 4.

In the case of the first query, the missing word Waldheira will still be considered during indexing because there are French documents that happen to contain it (fortunately, proper names tend to be preserved intact in translations). In other cases, words that the MT system did not know will end up being ignored at indexing. For example, one of our queries contained the rare word \"reusage\" which none of our MT systems knew.","As stated earlier, the (sometimes questionable) quality of translations with respect to syntactic structure has little effect on IR effectiveness. What is important is the choice of correct target language equivalents. 22 Both LOGOS and SYSTRAN produced several instances of inappropriate choice. For example, one of our queries contained \"drug traffic\"; while SYSTRAN correctly translated this term as \"trafic de drogue\", LOGOS incorrectly translated it as \"circulation de mrdicament\". The same query contained the word stem used as a verb and SYSTRAN mistranslated it as the noun \"tige\" (\"tree stem\"). Such errors lead to retrieving irrelevant documents.","Because MT systems choose a unique equivalent for each source language term, the resulting query sometimes misses documents containing different but related words. For example, the meaning of \"drug\" in the sense of Query 3 may be expressed as \"drogue\" or \"stuprfiant\" in French. By choosing to translate \"drug\" only by \"drogue\", documents describing \"stuprfiant\" cannot be retrieved. Despite these problems, the translations produced by LOGOS and SYSTRAN scored relatively high: an average precision of 28.66% with LOGOS and 27.63% with SYSTRAN. These results appear very good in\" comparison with comparable tests conducted in TREC-6 [6, 7]: typically, the average precision of this method was only about Â1⁄2 - 2/3 as high as monolingual IR.

For the same queries, we obtained 31.96% and 28.90% using LOGOS and SYSTRAN respectively. These performances are significantly better than other systems presented at TREC6."]},{"title":"CLIR using a bilingual dictionary","paragraphs":["We obtained from the Ergane project a bilingual dictionary which contains 7898 citation forms in English.

We tested a very simple approach: each word of an English query was replaced by all the French equivalents listed in the dictionary.

From the above examples, we can observe the following facts: In some cases, our dictionary lookup only produces inappropriate translations.

We also observe that the dictionary is not well distributed in the sense that less important words (from the IR point of view) may have more translations than more important ones. For example, in query 2, the word \"marriage\" 23 has only one translation, whereas the word \"increase\" has 10 translations. As a consequence, documents containing a word meaning \"increase\" will have a higher chance to be retrieved than a document about \"marriage\". Bilingual dictionaries do not seem to reflect the notion of importance that is relevant for IR. Our test queries contained few words that were missing from our dictionary, despite its limited size. No doubt, this is because the queries were mostly about general topics. Our dictionary-translated queries scored an average precision of 18.33%, that is, about 50% of our monolingual score. A variant of this approach consists in using a bilingual terminology database instead of a bilingual dictionary. In contrast with dictionaries, terminology databases tend to contain a lot of complex terms. Moreover, the terms are usually classified into domains. Consequently, one would expect terminology databases to provide a better basis on which to choose accurate indices for IR queries. We tested this approach using the \"Banque de Terminologie du Qurbec\" (Terminology database of Quebec - BTQ). This database contains over 500 000 terms in English and French, classified into about 160 domains. Most terms are highly specialized. Thus, the database is very rich in domain-specific information. On the other hand, words and expressions of everyday language are often missing. For example, in Query 1 \"Reasons for controversy surrounding Waldheim's World War II actions\", only the following words are found in BTQ: surround, if, action. In addition, matched words are assigned very idiosyncratic meanings in different specialized domains. In Query 2 \"are marriages increasing worldwide ?\", none of the words is found. Replacing the original query with BTQ matches does not result in anything close to a reasonable translation. As a result, our average precision was only about 8%, a performance well below our dictionary approach. We conclude that a highly specialized terminology database such as BTQ is not appropriate for general CLIR."]},{"title":"CLIR using a probabilistic translation model","paragraphs":["Query translation is performed as follows. An English query e is submitted to the probabilistic model as a single sentence so as to calculate p0~le), the probability that word fj will occur in any translation f of e. Since fj ranges over a very large vocabulary (all the French words observed in our training corpus), we want to retain only the best scoring words. This is because: 1) The longer the word list, the longer the time for the retrieval process. So a restriction in length leads to an increase in retrieval speed. 2) As the translation model is not perfect, the list is sometimes noisy. This is especially true when the source language query contains words whose frequency was low in our training corpus: probability estimations are then notoriously unreliable. By limiting the resulting list to an appropriate length, the amount of noise may be reduced. Thus, our \"translation\" of a query e will be simply made up of the n words f~ for which p(~le) is highest. We will experiment with several values of n in order to assess how this parameter affects IR effectiveness. The following lists show the first 20 words in the translations of the first 3 queries of our test corpus and their probabilities.

This has little impact because they are ignored during query indexing. We plan to remove them altogether in our future experiments. Some interesting facts may be observed in these lists: I) The word translations obtained reflect the pecularities of our training corpus. For example, the word \"drug\" is translated by, among others, \"m4dicament\" et \"drogue\", and a higher probability is attributed to \"mrdicament\". This is because in the Hansard corpus, the English \"drug\" refers more often to the sense \"m~dicament'\" than to \"drogue\". 2) This dependence on the training corpus sometimes leads to odd translations. For example, the word \"bille\" is considered as a French translation of \"logging\" in the English query \"effects of logging on desertification\". This translation comes from the fact that in the Hansard corpus \"log\" in English is often translated as \"bille de bois\" in French. 3) Some words are rare or even absent in our training corpus, and this leads to unreliable translations. For example, there was only one occurrence of \"acupuncture\" in the training corpus. Because of that, the model fails to assign a higher probability to the French \"acuponcture\" than to other semantically unrelated words that appeared in the same sentence. 4) The model sometimes fail to distinguish the real translation from noise induced by simple statistical associations. For example, the word \"prendre\" appears in the translations of queries 1 and 3. It is attributed with even higher probabilities than the true translation words of the query such as \"second\", \"action\" and \"stup4fiant\". Statistics alone may prove insufficient for tackling this problem correctly. Despite these problems, we observe that real translations and associated words tend to score relatively high and appear at the top of the list. When the probabilities are incorporated into the query vector used to retrieve documents, the documents containing these words will be retrieved in priority. What use should we make of the probabilities that our translation model associates to each word? Should we use them directly as the weights appearing in our query vector? Should we rather combine them with other information? Notice that the probabilities assigned by the translation model are related to the tf (term frequency) criterion of IR: our definition of p(~ le) is such that each individual occurrence of a word e~ in the query e will reinforce the f~'s that are likely translations for e,. However, our translation model has little to say about the other criterion that is so important in IR:"]},{"title":"idf","paragraphs":["(inverse document frequency).

However, when the length becomes too high (100), the effectiveness declines. This phenomenon may be explained as follows: the more words we retain in the translation: 1) the more related words get to be included; but 2) the more unrelated words get to be included as well. A good compromise is needed.

We thought it might help to incorporate additional evidence of a true translation relationship if any such evidence was available. It is often the case in IR that combining different sources of evidence increases IR effectiveness. This is why we tried combining our probabilistic translation model with the bilingual dictionary mentioned above."]},{"title":"Combining the probabilistic translation model with a bilingual dictionary","paragraphs":["A problem arises in such a combination due to the different nature of each element: one is weighted and the other is not. In other words, the question is the following: if a French word is a translation of an English word in the bilingual dictionary, how much should we increase the weight (probability) of this translation in the probabilistic model ? Our goal was not to provide a theoretically well founded answer to that question but simply to see if a simple-minded solution would prove useful in practic e . We tested the following approach: when a French translation is stored in the bilingual dictionary, its probability is increased by a"]},{"title":"default value,","paragraphs":["a constant determined manually. The new \"probability\" is used to obtain the transformed weight for the query vector as before. We tested several default values, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05.

This strongly confirms our intuition that combining two sources of information should produce better results. In many of the tested cases the combined approach outperform the MT systems. In the case where the default value is 0,02, and 50 translation words are retained, we obtained the best effectiveness 29,85% (among all the tested cases). It may be claimed here that there are better tools for CLIR than MT systems. For the 13 queries used in the TREC-6 tests, we obtain 34.26% and 30.49% for the cases where the default value is set at 0.02, and the lengths at 20 and 50. These performances are excellent in comparing with the best systems at the TREC-6 conference (24.35%). Although the improvements in effectiveness of the combined approach over MT systems obtained so far are still small, we think that 26 this approach may be further improved by 1) using a better training corpus; 2) using a more complete bilingual dictionary; and 3) a better method of combination. It is also possible to combine our probabilistic translation model with an MT system. As these two methods are based on different knowledge sources, the results could well prove superior too. We plan to examine this combination in the future."]},{"title":"4. Conclusions","paragraphs":["MT systems are considered by many as appropriate tools for CLIR. In this paper, we showed that there are better tools for CLIR than MT. We investigated the possibility of using a probabilistic translation model built automatically from a parallel corpus. In comparison with MT, this approach is more flexible. It may be used for any pair of languages for which an appropriate parallel corpus is available. When applied to CLIR, MT systems (LOGOS and SYSTRAN) can give a relatively good performance. Simpler approaches based only on bilingual dictionaries or terminology databases like BTQ lead to much poorer performance. Our probabilistic translation model almost rivals the performance of the MT systems, despite the fact that our training corpus is not closely related to the test corpus. In our experiments, we observed different advantages and disadvantages for different approaches to translate queries from a language to another. They often have complementary properties, and may be successfully combined. In this study, we combined our probabilistic translation model with a bilingual dictionary. This combination outperformed the MT systems, leading us to the conclusion that there are better approaches to CLIR than MT.","In all cases, the performance of CLIR remains substantially lower than that of monolingual IR. Thus there is still a lot of room for further improvement. There may not be any single translation method that will fill the bill. We believe that progress is likely to come from combining various sources of translation knowledge and we intend to continue testing such methods in our future research."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1.
