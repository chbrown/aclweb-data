Basically, I accept the ideas of 'cyclic CON-EVAL loop' and 'locally encoded finite candidate set' proposed by Hammond (1995, 1997b). However, in order to treat some features of Korean accented English such as vowel epenthesis, segment modification (stop voicing, devoicing, nasalization, etc.), and ambisyllabicity, I suppose that the input string of phonemes be linked to two templates of candidate grid sets; one for syllable position, and the other for (finite) possible output segments for each input segment. I will also use the ALIGN family of constraints to treat the Korean coda neutralization phenomena effectively."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In a second language acquisition, one of the most important factors in learner errors is first language transfer (Kenworthy, 1987; Major, 1994). Many Korean speakers, for example, mispronounce 'pick me up' as [phi!lmip̂] (stop nasalization) and 'stop it' as [swtha_bit] (vowel epenthesis and voiceless stop voicing), since they tend to transfer Korean phonology to their English IL.","Ellison (1994), Tesar (1995), Eisner (1997), Hammond (1995, 1997b), etc. propose how to implement OT. However, their implementation is usually based on basic syllable structure constraints such as *PEAK/C, *MARGIN/V, PARSE, FILL, ONSET, NoCoda, *COMPLEX, etc. Accordingly, it is hard for such implementation to cover the syllabification of real language data properly, since most languages including IL of Korean learners of English are not simple enough to be governed by only such constraints.","In the next section, I will present the salient features of Korean phonology and IL phonology of Korean speakers of English [IL-K-E] in terms of OT. In Section 3, I will propose how to implement an OT-based generator of IL-K-E. In Sections 4, I will mention contribution and future work of this project. Section 5 is the conclusion. * The generator in this paper is a subsystem of my Korean Accented English Pronunciation Simulator [KAEPS] system, which is part of the Ph.D. dissertation I am writing. The KAEPS system is implemented in PERL and deals with pronunciation not only of word-level but also of phrase-level English orthographic representations. The output of the KAEPS is three types of English pronunciations: 1) a phoneme-based English pronunciation, 2) a desirable allophone-based English pronunciation, and 3) one or some possible Korean accented English pronunciation(s).

Of course, all errors or mistakes in this paper are mine, ] Selinker (1969, 1972) proposed and elaborated the term \"interlanguage\" to explain the unique utterance of L2 learners. It is regarded as a separate linguistic system which results from a learner's attempts to produce a target language norm. 1"]},{"title":"2. IL Phonology of Korean Speakers of","paragraphs":["English [IL-K-E] Korean has three distinctive types of voiceless stops as phonemes: aspirated/ph, t h, kn/, fortis/p*, t*, k*/, and lenis /p, t, k/. Voiced stops do not exist as phonemes but exist as allophones, because lenis stops become voiced between two (voiced) sonorant sounds. Thus, unlike English, aspiration is a phonemic feature and voicing in stops is an allophonic one in Korean. Many Koreans tend to accept English voiceless stops as Korean aspirated stops, so they pronounce school as [stukhul]. In this project, the input of an English voiceless stop is regarded as an aspirated stop.","There are three salient features of Korean syllable structure. First, consonant clusters are not allowed. When speaking an English word with consonant clusters, many Koreans tend to insert a vowel as shown below:","(1) a. school [sw.khul] b. mint [rain.thin] In English, *COM should be lower-ranked than MAX or DEP.","In IL-K-E, vowel epenthesis occurs not only in consonant clusters but also in syllable-final fricatives or affricates or even stops preceded by a diphthong (Ahn, 1991; H-B Park, 1992; Broselow & H-B Park, 1995; Tak, 1996) as shown below:","(6) a. kiss [kais_m_] b. push [p~uJ'_i] c. tight [thaithw]. This is related to the second feature of Korean syllable structure that only seven consonants [p, t, k, m, n, q, 11 can occur in the coda position in Korean. Labial and velar stops are neutralized as a homorganic lenis stop (/ph, p., p/ ~ [p]; /k h, k*, k/ ~ [k]), and all coronal obstruents as [t] (It h, t*, t, t~ h, ~*, t~, s, s*/~ [t]). To deal with this coda neutralization phenomenon, I propose the following Feature Alignment Constraints, revising Hong (1997): 2 Let us see how such IL pronunciation is obtained in terms of OT. First of all, the following OT constraints are to be considered:","(2) *.'_COMPLEX [*COMI (P&S) No more than one C or V may associate to any syllable position node.","(3) MAX (McCarthy, 1995a) Every element of S 1 has a correspondent in $2.

(no insertion of a segment) The constraint ranking seems to be {*COM, MAX} >> DEP as depicted in (5):","(5) mint /mintn/ min mint h min.thtu *COM MAX DEP *! *! 2 Adopting McCarthy & Prince's (1993) General Alignment and It6 & Mester's (1994) concept of CodaCond, Hong (1997) proposes the following:","Align-Left ([larygeal], G) . This is based on Lombardi's (1995a,b) proposal of laryngeal neutralization. That is, laryngeal features such as aspiration or voicing appears only in the syllable-initial position. However, the scope of Korean coda neutralization is not limited only to laryngeal neutralization, since alveolar fricatives and alveopalatal affricates are also neutralized as a plain lenis alveolar stop It/ as described above. Furthermore, a voiced stop can occur in an ambisyllabic coda position by means of Lenis Stop Voicing as shown in (19) later."]},{"title":"2","paragraphs":["(8) !DENT-IO [F] (McCarthy, 1995a) Correspondent elements in S 1 and $2 have identical values for feature [F].

Syllable Generation of Korean Accented English in OT 3.1 Problems According to Hammond (1997b), the greatest problem in OT-based implementation is the possibility of the infinite candidate set when epenthesis (violation of DEP) or deletion (violation of MAX) are allowed, since Gen can produce infinitely any candidates. Even if there is no epenthesis or deletion, assuming that any segment can be syllabified as an onset, peak, coda or unparsed element, a word with n elements may have 4\" possible syllabifications, which is an exponential problem. In addition, each candidate has to be tested by each constraint. That is, the combination of the number of candidates times the number of constraints must be considered, which is an arithmetic but still nontrivial problem.","To solve these problems, he proposes: I) implementation of syllabification is made by a form of a parser, which does not need to consider epenthesis nor deletion; 2) syllabification is encoded locally; and 3) a cyclic CON-EVAL loop is applied constraint by constraint.","The problems of implementation of IL-K-E in OT are more complicated than those raised by Hammond, since ambisyllabicity, epenthesis, and segment modification should be considered. The allow epenthesis, even if the final segment is a voiced stop. More experimental research is required on this issue, and I will skip this in this paper. system dealing with such syllabification cannot be a parser but a generator. 7 3.2 Korean accented English Generator I assume that the initial candidate set produced by Gen can be predictable and finite, following the previous researches (Ellison, 1994; Tesar, 1995; Eisner, 1997; Hammond, 1995, 1997b). I adopt the concept of local encoding (Hammond, 1995, 1997b) developed from the concept of finite state automata (Ellison, 1994) and that of dynamic programming (Tesar, 1995). Unlike Hammond, however, since the role of this generator is not only syllabifying the input segments but also modifying them into suitable output segments, I suppose there are two templates of candidate grids: one representing syllable positions, and the other representing potential segment output forms.","Supposing the input is a phrase like stop it, whose string of phonemes is/s t h a ph # i th/, the grids look like below:","(22) Grid A (for syllable position) s t h a ph # i t h O O O O O O O n n n n n n n nn nn an nn nn nn nn C C C C C C C CO CO CO CO CO CO CO on on on on on on on U U U U U U U (23) Grid B (for output segments 8) 7 Hammond differentiates, \"The generator would start with an input form, generate candidate syllabifications, and apply constraints to produce a syllabified output. A parser would start with an unsyllabified output, generate candidates, and produce a syllabified output\" (p.6). s In producing candidates for segments, only those which may become optimal forms in some situations are considered. The number of candidates for S t h a ph # i t h S t h .a ph # i t\" t p ~ t d b d","n m n s w t n w ph w t h w As shown in (22), each segment can be an onset, a nucleus, two nuclei, 9 a coda, an ambisyllabic coda-onset, an onset + a nucleus (due to epenthesis), or an unparsed segment. Deletion is not considered in the current project. Constraints (cyclic CON-EVAL) prune away disfavored candidates cyclically. If there is only one member left in the candidate set, it should not be pruned away by any constraint. Grid A (22) is treated first, and then Grid B (23) is treated.","There are constraints such as NUC requiring a nucleus in a syllable, and *MARGIN/V saying a vowel cannot be an onset or a coda, and *PEAK/C saying a consonant cannot be a nucleus. So, if a segment is a vowel, all candidates but 'nn' (for a diphthong) or 'n' (for another vowel) are removed, and if a consonant, 'n' and 'nn' is removed as shown in (24) (the removable candidate is italicized and underlined): (24) NUC, *MARGIN/V, *PEAK/C s t\" a p\" # i t\" o o _o o o p_ o n_ _n n n_ n n _n n n n_.n_ nn nn nn nn nn c c _c c c g c co co c._.Q, co co c._..Q co on on o_v_ on on o__v_ on u u _u u u _u I u segments depends on the types of segments.

Conclusion This paper deals with an OT-based generator for Interlanguage phonology of Korean speakers of English. Hammond (1997b) insists that OT-based syllabification be made as a parser which does not need to consider epenthesis or deletion. However, in order to syllabify Korean accented English, not only epenthesis but also segment modification such as stop voicing/devoicing or stop nasalization should be considered.","I adopted the basic ideas proposed by Hammond and others: finite candidate set, cyclic CON-EVAL and local encoding. I proposed two templates of candidate sets: one representing syllable positions (onset, nucleus, two nuclei, coda, ambisyllabic coda-onset, onset + epenthesized vowel, and unparsed position), the other representing potential output forms for each segment. Under the basic syllable constraints, the optimal candidates in the syllable position grid are selected. The result is used to generate the potential output segments which can be revised from the original input segments under the constraints basically applicable to Korean phonology.","9"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ahn, Sang-Cheol. 1991.
