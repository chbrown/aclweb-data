Researchers of this field have an approach to language acquisition in which learning is visualized as developing a generative, stochastic model of language and putting this model into practice (Marcken, 1996).","Automatic word categorization is an important field of application in statistical natural language processing where the process is unsupervised and is carried out by working on n-gram statistics to find out the categories of words. Research in this area points out that it is possible to determine the structure of a natural language by examining the regulaxities of the statistics of language (Finch, 1993).","It is possible to construct a bottom-up unsupervised algorithm for the categorization process. In our paper named \"A Method for Improving Automatic Word Categorization\"(Korkmaz&Uqoluk, 1997) such a method, using a modified greedy-type algorithm supported by the notions of fuzzy logic, has been proposed. The distance metric used to measure the similarities of linguistic elements in this research is the Manhattan Metric. This metric is based on the absolute difference between the corresponding values of vector components. The components of the vectors correspond to bigrarn statistics of words for our case. However words from the same linguistic category in natural language may have to-tally different frequencies. So using a distance metric based on only the absolute differences may not be so suitable for the linguistic categorization process. In this paper various distance metrics are analyzed with the same algorithm in order to find out the most suitable one that could be used for linguistic elements. Comparisons are made for the results obtained using different metrics.","The organization of this paper is as follows. First the related work in the area of word categorization is presented in section 2. Then a general descrip-tion of the categorization process and our proposed algorithm is given in 3 section, which is followed by presentation of different distance metrics that can be used with the algorithm. In section 5 the results of the experiments and the comparisons between the metrics are given. We discuss the relevance of the results and conclude in the last section."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Usually unigram and the bigram statistics are used for automatic word categorization.

Different distance metrics are proposed for the distance between vectors. The usage of a distance metric forms the main discussion point of this paper. In next section first the algorithm used for categorization will be presented and in section 4 these metrics and their usage for linguistic categorization will be discussed. 3.2 The Algorithm for Categorization Having a distance function, it is possible to start the clustering process. The first idea that can be used is to form a greedy algorithm to start forming the hierarchy of word clusters. If the lexicon space to be clustered consists of"]},{"title":"{wl,w2,...,wn},","paragraphs":["then the first element from the lexicon space w~ is taken and a cluster with this word and its nearest neighbor or neighbors is formed. Then the lexicon space is {(wl, ws~, ..., w~), wi, ..., w,} where (wl, ws~, ..., ws~) is the first cluster formed. The process is repeated with the first element in the list which does not belong to any set yet (wi for our case) and the process iterates until no such word is left. The sets formed will be the clusters at the bottom of the cluster hierarchy. Then to determine the behavior of a set, the frequencies of its elements axe added and the previous process this time is carried on the sets rather than on single words until the cluster hierarchy is formed, so the algorithm stops when a single set is formed that contains all the words in. the lexicon space.","In the early stages of this research such a greedy method was used to form the clusters. However, though some clusters at the low levels of the tree seemed to be correctly formed, as the number of elements in a cluster increased towards the higher levels, the clustering results became unsatisfactory.","Two main factors were observed as the reasons for the unsatisfactory results.","These were: • Shortcomings of the greedy type algorithm.","• inadequacy of the method used to obtain the set behavior from the properties of its elements.","The greedy method results in a non optimal clustering in the initial level. To make this point clearer consider the following example: Let us assume that four words wl,w2, w3 and w4 axe forming the lexicon LEXICON SPACE 2 Figure 1: Example for the clustering problem of greedy algorithm in a lexicon space with four different words. Note that d~2.~ s is the smallest distance in the distribution. However since wl is taken into consideration, it forms setl with its nearest neighbor w2 and w3 combines with w4 and form set2, although w2 is nearer. And the expected third set is not formed. space. Furthermore, let the distances between these words be defined as dw~,wj. Then consider the distribution in Figure 1. If the greedy method first tries to cluster Wl, then it will be clustered with w2, since the smallest dwl,w, value is d~l,~ 2. So the second word will be captured in the set and the algorithm will continue the clustering process with w3. At this point, though w3 is closest to w2, it is captured in a set and since w3 is closer to w4 than the center of this set is, a new cluster will be formed with members w3 and w4. However, as it can be obviously seen visually from Figure 1 the first optimal cluster to be formed between these four words is the set","The second problem causing unsatisfactory clustering occurs after the initial sets axe formed. According to the algorithm, the clusters behave exactly like other single words and participate in the clustering just as single words do. However to continue the process, the bigram statistics of the clusters should be determined. This means that the distance between the cluster and all the other elements in the search space have to be calculated. One easy way to determine this behavior is to find the average of the statistics of all the elements in a cluster. This method has its drawbacks. If the corpus used for the process is not large, the proximity problem becomes severe. On the other hand the linguistic role of a word may vary in contexts in different sentences. Many words axe used as noun , adjective or falling intosome other linguistic category depending on the context. It can be claimed that each word initially shall be placed in a cluster according to its dominant role. However to determine the behavior of a set the dominant roles of its elements should also be used. Somehow the common properties (bigrams) of the elements should be always used and the deviations of each element should be eliminated in the process."]},{"title":"Korkmaz and G6kt~rk O~oluk 113 Choosing,4 Distance Metn'c for Word Categorization 3.2.1 Improving the Greedy Method","paragraphs":["The clustering process is improved to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks. To overcome the first problem the idea used is to allow words to be members of more than one cluster. So after the first pass over the lexicon space, intersecting clusters are formed. For the lexicon space presented in Figure 1 with four words, the expected third set will be also .formed. As the second step these intersecting sets are combined into a single set. Then the closest two words in each combined set (according to the distance function) are found and these two closest words are taken into consideration as the centroid for that set. After finding the centroids of all sets, the distances between a member and all the centroids are calculated for all the words in the lexicon space. Following this, each word is moved to the set where the distance between this member and the set center is minimal. This procedure is necessary since the initial sets are formed by combining the intersecting sets. When these intersecting sets are combined the set center of the resulting set might be far away from some elements and there may be other closer set centers formed by other combinations, so a reorganization of membership is appropriate. 3.2.2 Fuzzy Membership","As presented in the previous section the clustering process builds up a cluster hierarchy. In the first step, words are combined to form the initial clusters, then those clusters become members of the process themselves. To combine dusters into new ones their statistical behavior should be determined. The statistical behavior of a cluster is related to the bigrams of its members. In order to find out the dominant statistical role of each cluster the notion of fuzzy membership is used.","The problem that each word can belong to more than one linguistic category brings up the idea that the sets of word clusters cannot have crisp border lines and even if a word seems to be in a set due to its dominant linguistic role in the corpus, it can have a degree of membership to the other clusters in the search space. Therefore the concept of fuzzy membership can be used for determining the bigram statistics of a cluster.","Researchers working on fuzzy clustering present a framework for defining fuzzy membership of elements. Gath and Geva (Gath, 1989) describe such an unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering. They present the K-means algorithm based on minimiza-tion of an objective function.

We were able to get an initial success rate of about 90% with the Manhattan Metric when we discarded this large faulty cluster. However with the other metrics this success rate has been obtained for all the lexicon space.","The second problem encountered for the categorization process appears while combining the initial clusters into larger ones• Although it is possible to obtain some local successful combinations with the first metric, the overall performance in combining these initial clusters is not so satisfactory. So different metrics presented in section 4 have been tested on the algorithm. Unfortunately, although the proposed metrics were able to overcome the first problem of having a large faulty cluster, the progress obtained in combining initial clusters into larger ones was not so significant. This has been the factor triggering the idea that a metric taking into consideration both of the approaches for linguistic similarity would be more suitable for our case. So the fifth metric, the Combined Metric, has been constructed. The main progress obtained with this fifth metric is on the second problem described.","In table 2 the hierarchies obtained using different metrics are presented. When the properties presented in this table are examined, the hierarchy formed by the Manhattan Metric has the minimum number of initial clusters. This is due to the large faulty cluster formed with this metric. The properties of the hierarchies presented in table 2 seem to be similar to each other. Only the depth of the tree formed with the Angle Metric differs from the other ones. This is because more initial clusters are combined on the second level in the hierarchy obtained with this metric. This brings in an increase in the number of ill-structured clusters on the second level over-combining distinct linguistic categories. 5.1 Empirical Comparison The main progress for the clustering hierarchy is obtained by the Combined Metric. It seems suitable to examine this metric in detail and compare the results with the initial organization obtained by the Manhattan Metric.","Some linguistic categories inferred by the algorithm using the Combined Metric are listed below:","• professor opposite church hall least present once last baby prisoner doctor wind gate village sun country • earth forest garden truth river • picture case glass","• captain servant book horse meeting situation circumstances summer afternoon evening night morning day future early","• large new small great very strange certain good fine few little • slight man's sudden thousand hundred different","• rich fair secret blue soft cold bright quick frightened surprised plain clear true greater worse better tall dead living wrong • notice cry hold touch influence act account form effect care","• meant ought wanted used enough back began tried turned came • enter pass follow carry call give bring tell do let forgive • impossible possible necessary • calm pale warm simple sweet quiet busy hot angry ill • aunt uncle sister husband's • duty attention desire turning coming close • listening ready trying going • died fallen drawn learned written gone • known taken brought given • shoulders neck pocket hat chair shoulder arm mouth • person girl lady woman gentleman man fellow else thing","• affairs age speech action marriage questions ideas looks silence society love experience","• between towards upon against after before like about round off away up • under into through on at over","• during near toward beside within around behind gave told took • shall should may will must would might i • won't cannot can can't are didn't don't Korkmaz and G6ktark Ugoluk 117 Choosing,4 Distance Metric for Word Categorization","J Combined Manhattan","Metric Metric","Nouns","Largest ~ of words 94 co!!~eed","S,,~qs Rate 91.5% # of initial 15","clusters connected","Verbs (present perfect~ 111 94.6% 6","--Largest ~ of words 67","collected Success Rate 100%","of initial 12","clusters connected","Verl~s (past perfect)","Largest ~ of words 16","collected Success Rate 100% ~# of initial 5","clusters connected","45 73.3%","2 100%","Larlgest ~ of words collected","of initial clusters connected 68 17","92.6% 100% 7","Largest ~ of words","collected S ,,~x~ Rate","of initial","clusters connected","Adverbs 9 4 100% 100% 1 1","LargeSt ~ of words","collected Success Rate","of initial","clusters connected","I, ar~est ~ of words","enll*cted S~MS Rat®","of initial","clusters connected","Auxiliaries 7 9 100% 100% 1 1","~)etecmlners 16 10 100% 100% 1 1 Table 3: Comparison made between Combined Metric and Manhattan Metric based on the largest number of elements combined in a cluster. • anybody everyone nobody everybody everything","• exactly finding hearing watching all leaving seeing giving keeping knowing","• those these our an a this his their the your my her any no some not such its","The ill-placed members in the clusters above are shown using bold font. The above initial clusters represent the linguistic categories with a success rate of 90.2%. Also the plural nouns in singular noun clusters are shown in italics. If we consider those placements as faulty ones also, the calculated success rate would fall to 88.1%. This success rate seems to be similar to the results obtained with other distance metrics. However as explained above the main progress obtained with this Combined Metric is on the process of combining these initial clusters into larger ones in the upper levels of the duster hierarchy.","Two examples from the cluster hierarchy obtained with this metric are given in tables 4 and 5. In table 4 94 nouns coming from different initial clusters are combined in the same part of the cluster hierarchy. Only one cluster seems to be misplaced in this region. This is an adjective cluster. In table 5 67 different verbs are collected. They are all present tense verbs and no misplaced word exists in tiffs part of the hierarchy. This is another well-formed part of the cluster organization. It is believed that this is an important improvement compared to earlier results, since there is an increase in the number of successfully connected initial clusters.","Table 3 exhibits the improvement obtained using the Combined Metric. Maximum number of words correctly classified for some linguistic categories are shown in this table. Obviously there are other clusters having dements from the same linguistic categories in different parts of the hierarchy. This table makes a comparison of the maximum numbers of words successfully collected in order to analyze the improvement obtained. Gathering nouns and auziliaries seems to be carried out better with the Manhattan Metric. However if we consider the number of initial clusters forming these largest ones, a signilicant progress seems to exist for the Combined Metric. There is a big difference for these numbers between the two. For instance 12 present perfect verb classes are combined successfully when the Combined Metric is used, but only 8 of them were combined with the Manhattan Metric. For adjectives this is 7 to 2, for past perfect verbs 5 to 1 and although number of nouns collected by the Manhattan Metric is larger, number of initial clusters suecessfully combined by the Combined Metric is still larger.","It can be claimed that there is a significant progress in the process of successfully combining the initial clusters when the new metric is used. This was the main problem encountered with the Manhat'tan Metric and the other ones. This is denoted as the progress obtained by using the Combined Metric trying to represent both of the two approaches that can be taken into account for the similarity of linguistic dements."]},{"title":"6 Discussion And Conclusion","paragraphs":["This research has focussed on the usage of distance function for an unsupervised, bottom-up algorithm for automatic word categorization.

Though it was not possible to to combine these initial clusters into exact linguistic categories, the cluster hierarchy obtained with Combined metric is encouraging. The faulty placements axe mainly due to the the very complex structure of natural language. The fact that many words can be used with different linguistic roles in natural language sentences produces deviations in the information given by the bigrams. Using fuzzy logic and a suitable distance metric is a way to decrease these deviations, however it was not possible to remove them totally. Korkmaz, E. E. and G.
