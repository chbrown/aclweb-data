Its purpose is to offer a detailed analysis of some verb classes so that the reader may grasp the main ideas guiding our methodology for constructing verb predicates using the WordNet lexicon. We plan to publish a complete listing of all our predicates and subpredicates for all WordNet verb classes, once they have been fully tested. In (Gomez, 1998), the reader can find a detailed description and evaluation of the semantic interpreter algorithm that uses the lexical entries defined here. This paper complements (Gomez, 1998) in which, for space reasons, only one predicate could be analyzed.","The hierarchical decomposition of predicates plays a central role in our methodology. A generic predicate subsumes all its subpredicates in a similar way in which the generic concept \"book\" subsumes all its subconcepts. A subpredicate inherits thematic roles and inferences from its super-predicate. From the point of view of the lexicographer, inheritance comes with an added bonus because it allows her/him to handle a large number of verbs by just defaulting their lexical entry to its super-predicate. In a subsequent analysis, the lexical entries can be refined by mapping some verbs which were just defaulted to a superpredicate into their own subpredicates. This top down approach and the WordNet lexicon makes possible to define predicates for every English verb in a \"reasonable\" amount of time. The mapping of","Q","XThis paper contains some material published aa report UCF-CS-TR-97-03 January-4-1997 with the same title. 58 WordNet verb classes into generic predicates has required to define new classes and to reclassify and/or redefine some WordNet classes and subclasses. The WordNet ontology for nouns also has been reorganized and redefined in some respects in order to con-form with the entries in the thematic roles of the predicates. (See (Gomez, 1998) for some details.) Two major consequences derive from anchoring verb classes in abstract semantic predicates: coalescing several WordNet synsets into a predicate, and mapping the same WordNet synset into distinct predicates.

A similar view has been presented in (Pustejovsky, 1995). Semantic interpretation is delayed until the end of a clause. For every verb in a clause, WordNet provides a list of verb synsets for which we have defined predicates. These predicates are contenders for the meaning of the verb. For every syntactic relation in the clause, the interpreter checks each predicate in order to see if the predicate has a thematic role which is realized by the syntactic relation. The interpreter records this fact and gets the next syntactic relation. The predicate that realizes the most syntactic relations in the sentence is selected as the meaning of the verb. In case of ties, the predicate that has more thematic roles realized is selected. 2"]},{"title":"The syntax of roles","paragraphs":["The syntax of roles in the predicates that will be defined below is ~ven by the cfg grammar on the next page.

The thematic roles of the predicates are connected to WordNet ontology for nouns and to the syntactic relations that realize them. Our approach to building verb meaning is based on the decomposition of a predicate into subpredicates. Subpredicates inherit not only thematic roles, but also inferences as explained in (Gomez, 1996). Inferences will be defined for generic predicates and subpredicates subsuming a large class of verb forms. The final product will be a network of predicates linked by subsumption, and inferences, and connected to the WorcbNet ontology for nouns and to grammatical relations. As of this writing we have defined predicates for 70% of WordNet verb forms.","We are using the term \"inference\" to refer to both entailments and non-monotonic inferences, also called defeasible inferences. The term \"entailment\" is used in the sense of analytic implication (Quine, 1960). A sentence, say sl, entails sentence s2 if s2 is true in every world in which sl is true. An example of entailment is \"if Peter killed the roach, the roach is dead.\" An example of non-monotonic inference is \"if Peter likes apples, he eats them.\" Of course, it is very important to bear in mind that the difference between non-monotonic inferences and entailments is a question of degrees as Quine (Quine, 1953) has argued convincely. See (Gomez, 1996) for a discussion.","Our work differs from the semantic role list approaches (Fillmore, 1968) in several essential as-pects. First of all in our method, the semantic roles are not defined independently of the meaning of the verb and are not semantically unanalyzable. In addi-tion, the number of thematic roles depends on each predicate, and not on some general criteria saying which thematic roles there will be, irrespective of each predicate. Any thematic role in a predicate corresponds to a meaning relation from which inferences specific to that predicate or subpredicates must be established. Consider the sentence \"These birds fly 11,000 miles from their breeding grounds to their winter home in the Antarctic.\" What is the thematic role corresponding to the NP \"11,000 miles?\" Some semantic relation needs to be recognized so that inferences such as \"there is a distance of 11,000 miles between the breeding grounds of these birds and their winter home\" can be established. We have recognized that semantic relation by creating the role"]},{"title":"distance","paragraphs":["meaning the distance traveled by an animate agent in a"]},{"title":"change-of-location","paragraphs":["predicate (Gomez, 1998).

Because the NP \"11,000 miles\" is not a subcategorized argument of \"fly,\" why call it a \"role\" and not an \"adjunct\"?

It makes sense to say \"She eats/studies/writes/.., quickly,\" but not \"She eats 20 miles.\" Thus from our point of view, an \"adjunct\" is a role that is inherited by every subpredicnte of action.","This approach does not lead to a propagation of roles since their number and nature depend on the generic predicate and its subpredicates. The critique of \"role fragmentation - the subdivision of a single role into many subroles as result of subsequent analysis (Dowry, 1991) - is valid ff the entailments are based exclusively on the role, but not if they are an-chored on the role and the predicate. The roles that we have used throughout our analysis have differences in meaning across diverse generic predicates, or verb classes. For instance, the meaning of the role theme in a change of state verb, say \"break,\" is different from its meaning in a transfer of information verb, say \"tell.\" Hence, if the entailments are based only on the role, one would be compelled to recognize several types of theme (Dowty, 1991), but because the entailments are based on the predicate and on the role, this is not necessary. Role entailments are shared by subpredicates of a generic predicate not across generic predicates.","Our approach also differs from those analyses that attempt to reduce the verb semantic analysis to a small set of notions e.g., Jackendoff'localist hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1990), Dowty-Vendler's aspectual hypothesis (Vendler, 1967), Dowty (Dowry, 1979), or to a small set of primitives (Schank, 1975). Our major critique to reductionist analyses are Quinean (Quine, 1960) in nature, namely meaning is holistic. Trying to reduce verb meaning to a small set of notions is going to fail because verb meaning is intersentential. One may take some verbs whose meaning can be reduced to some few principles, or notions. Verbs of change of location fit very well within the localist hypothesis, while verbs of creation seem to support the aspectual hypothesis. But, if you consider a verb like \"graduate\" the situation is rather different because many sentences mediate to form its meaning. One may say that it is an accomplishment verb, but that is not saying much. Trying to provide a CD representation (Schank, 1975) for it seems hopeless. The key point here is that the representation needs to make possible the inferences normadly associated with such verb. For instance, that if one is asked which school Clinton attended, one should say \"Yale\" upon reading that Clinton grad-64 uated from Yale. Hierarchical predicate decomposition and inferences shared by subpredicates of the same generic predicate is the solution that we offer. However, we always keep in mind that meaning is a question of degrees. It can be approximated, but not fully grasped. Fortunately, approximation is all we need for the task of natural language processing.","References","D. R. Dowty. 1979. Word Meaning and Montague Grammar.
