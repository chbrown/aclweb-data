The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics 1 presentations about complex, quantitative information. The goal of the current implementation of the system is to produce analyses and summarizations of the quantitative data output by a transportation scheduling program.","In our approach [Kerpedjiev etal.1997a, Kerpedjiev et al.1997b, Green et a1.1998,","This work was supported by DARPA contract num-","ber DAA-1593K0005.","le.g., charts, tables, maps, rather than pictorial forms","of representation. 69 Kerpedjiev et ai.1998], the content and organization of a presentation is first planned at a media-independent level using a hierarchical planner [Young1994]. In this way, a high-level presentation goal, such as to assist the user to evaluate a transportation schedule created by the scheduling program, is ultimately decomposed into media-independent subgoals, whose content is represented in the content language. The content language also is used to represent the content of the media-independent communicative acts, e.g., Assert and Recommend, selected by the planner to satisfy these subgoals. 2 Content language expressions are constructed by the plan constraint functions of the presentation plan operators during planning.","The content language in the presentation plan is used by the system's two media-specific generators, one for text and one for information graphics. A media allocation component decides which parts of the plan shall be realized by each generator. The text generator transforms its assigned parts to sentence specifications, for realization by a general-purpose sentence generator (SURGE) [Elhadad and Robin1996]. The graphics generator transforms its assigned parts of the plan to a sequence of user tasks which a graphic must support in order to satisfy the presentation goals. The tasks are then input to a graphic design system (SAGE)","2In other words, the content language describes that which is to be asserted, recommended, believed, etc., rather than the types of communicative acts to be performed or propositional attitudes which the acts are intended to achieve. [Roth and Mattis1990, Roth et a1.1994] which automatically designs and realizes a graphic supporting the tasks.","One of the requirements for our content language is the ability to represent complex descriptions of quantitative database attributes, such as total port capacity of all ports and 90~ of the total weight of the cargo arriving by clay 25. In addition to application-specific concepts such as port capacity, such descriptions involve the specification of applicationindependent quantitative relations (e.g., 90~ of ...), aggregate properties of sets (e.g., total ... of all ... ), and time-dependent relations (e.g., increase from ... to ... during the interval ...). Thus, we would like for the language to be able to express a wide range of quantitative and temporal relations and aggregate properties, rather than just those required for the current domain of transportation scheduling.","Another requirement is for the content language to represent these descriptions compositionally. A compositional representation should facilitate the work of the text and graphics generators, as well as media coordination.","A third requirement for the content language is the ability to represent subtle differences in communicative intention with respect to the same data. To give an example in the domain which will be used for illustration in the rest of the paper, the same data 3 could underly either the assertion that Three newspapers that are circulated in Pittsburgh carry only national news or the assertion that Three newspapers that carry only national news are circulated in Pittsburgh. However, while conveying the same facts about the three newspapers, the two assertions are not interchangeable. The first assertion would be more effective than the second in an argument such as Be careful which newspaper you read to find out what is going on locally. The","3All data used in the paper is fictitious. However, many of the examples were inspired by a naturally occuring example about the numbers of readers of newspapers read in Pittsburgh. We have selected this domain for illustration because it requires minimal background knowledge. 70 Post-Gazette covers both national and local news, but three newspapers that are circulated in Pittsburgh carry only national news. while the second would be more effective than the first in Pittsburghers are interested in national affairs. In fact, three newspapers that carry only national news are circulated in Pittsburgh. As will be shown later in the paper, the content language enables related assertions such as these to be differentiated.","A final requirement is for the representation scheme to be media-independent in order to provide a common input language for the media-specific generators. We assume that such a common language will facilitate the difficult problem of media coordination. On the other hand, the language must satisfy the needs of both the text and information graphics generators.","In the rest of the paper, first we describe the content language, focusing on aspects of the content language which are applicable to other domains. Next, we illustrate how subtle varia-tions in communicative intention can be represented in the content language, and give examples of how they can be expressed in text and information graphics. Finally, we describe some related work."]},{"title":"2 Content Language","paragraphs":["In order to ensure that the language would be applicable to a variety of quantitative domains, we first performed a corpus analysis, the results of which are summarized in the next section. Then we describe the syntax we adopted to satisfy the requirements given in the introduction. 2.1 Corpus Analysis We have collected samples of presentations with integrated natural language and graphics in order to describe and analyze the vocabulary and structure of such presentations. To ensure generality, the corpus includes presentations from different disciplines (Economics and Medicine) and intended for different audiences. 4 It also includes samples from collections of presentations compiled by others, such as [Tufte1983, Tufte1990, Tufte1997, Kosslyn1994], and prescriptive examples found in books on how to design effective presentations [Zelazny1996, Kosslyn1994].","The analysis of this corpus contributed directly to the development of a vocabulary for the content language. To describe the content of the presentations in the corpus, we distinguish three different sets of predicates with associated modifiers, as follows: 5","Â• Comparison Predicates: [much] Greater, Lower I Highest, Lowest I [very] Far-from, Close-to I [almost I exactly ] Equal, n-Times.Comparison Predicates apply to any quantitative attribute of individuals or sets, e.g., On this measure Central Europe's stockmarkets are still puny compared with those of fast-growing Asian countries.","Â• Global Predicates: [widelylslightly] Vary [:from :to], Constant. Global Predicates apply to quantitative attributes of sets, e.g., Sales representative performance is uneven.","Â• Trend Predicates: Remain-constant I [considerably I slightly] Increase, Decrease [:from :to] I Drop, Fall, Rise [:from :to] I Reach-a-Plateau I Fluctuate, Trend Predicates apply only to time series (a set of data ordered chronologically), e.g., Production of television sets in Russia fell from 4.5m units in 1991 to fewer than lm in 1995. 2.2 Syntax The first three requirements described in the In-troduction (representing quantitative and temporal relations and aggregate properties, com-","4Economics: The Economist (March-August 1996).

The features of RQFOL most useful for our purposes are (i) that it permits pragmatic distinctions to be made among expressions which are semantically equivalent, and (ii) that it supports the compositional specification of complex descriptions of discourse entities [Webber1983].","A pragmatic distinction supported in RQFOL and our content language is the distinction between the main predication of an expression and information to be conveyed about the objects of the main predication. For example, although (la) and (lb) are semantically equivalent with (lc), they are not interchangeable in their effectiveness for achieving different communicative intentions (as was demonstrated in the Introduction.) In (la) the main predication is about news coverage, whereas in (lb) it is about newspaper circulation.","(la) Three newspapers that are circulated in Pittsburgh carry only national news.","(lb) Three newspapers that carry only national news are circulated in Pittsburgh.","(lc) There is a set of three newspapers such that for every newspaper in the set, it is circulated in Pittsburgh and carries only national news.","To represent this distinction in the content language, a communicative act has the form, (Act Proposition Referents), where Act specifies the type of action (such as Assert), Proposition is a quantifier-free FOL formula describing the main predication, and Referents is a list describing the arguments of the main predication. (It is assumed that the agent performing a communicative action is the system, and that the audience is the user.) For example, (la) and (Ib) can be analyzed ass realizing the assertions (2a) and (2b), respectively. In (2a), the main predication is (has-coverage ?dl National-only); the variable ?dl is further described as three newspapers that are circulated in Pittsburgh. 6 In (2b), the main predication is (has-circulation ?dI Pittsburgh); the variable ?dl is further described as three newspapers whose coverage is national news only.","(2a) (Assert (has-coverage ?dl National-only) ((?dl (for (cardinal 3) ?x newspaper","(has-circulation ?x Pittsburgh)))))","(2b) (Assert (has-circulation ?dl Pittsburgh) ((?dl (for (cardinal 3) ?x newspaper","(has-coverage ?x National-only)))))","In general, each element of the Referents list has the form (term description), where term is a variable or a database object identifier; and term denotes a discourse entity. If provided, description specifies information about term that is required to achieve the goal(s) of the communicative act, as opposed to information whose only function is to enable the audience to identify the entity. Only descriptions with an attributive function are specified in the presentation plan. Referential descriptions, whose function is only to enable the audience to identify an entity, are constructed by the media-specific generators. (For information about the different roles of attributive and referential descriptions in our system, see [Green et a1.1998].) In general, description is of the form (for quantifier variable class restriction). (In (2a) and (2b), quantifier is the cardinal 3, the class is newspaper, and the restriction is (has-circulation ?z Pittsburgh) and (has-coverage ?x National-only), respectively.)","Complex descriptions can easily be expressed in a compositional manner in the content language. For example, (3a) is a possible realization in text of the assertion given in (3b). (A graphic realizing (3b) is shown in (3c) of Figure 1.) In (3b), the main predication, (gt ?dl ?d2), is that ?dl is greater than ?d2. ?dl is to be described as the unique integer ?x such that ?x is the number of readers of SPPG.

One goal of this exercise is to illustrate what distinctions can be expressed graphically, but not what information should be expressed in graphics. (The problem of deciding which media to use, media allocation, is beyond the scope of this paper.) Thus, the examples of graphics are minimal in the sense that they have been designed to convey the information to be asserted and as little as possible other information. However, in some cases it is not possible not to convey more in graphics than was intended.","For example in (3c) in Figure 1, which realizes (3b), the graphic also conveys information about relative numbers of readers of each of the newspapers, e.g., that the Post-Gazette has about one-third more than the sum of the others, and that the others have about the same number of readers each.

In this case, it conveys additional information about the relative numbers of readers among the newspapers with national coverage only, and the fact that there are three of those newspapers.

The COMET [Feiner and McKeown1991] and WIP [Wahlster et ah1993] systems generate in-structions for operating physical devices, and [Maybury1991] describes a system that designs narrated or animated route directions in a cartographic information system. These systems represent content about complex sequences of actions the user can perform on the physical device and their effects, as well as spatial con-74 cepts. However, this work is not relevant to information graphics generation.","The multimedia system whose focus is closest to ours, PostGraphe [Fasciano and Lapalme1996], is a system that generates multimedia statistical reports consisting of graphics and text. However, there are some fundamental differences with our approach. First, in Postgraphe it is assumed that a presentation is about the entire dataset, whereas our content language can be used to describe subsets and individuals in the dataset. Second, in Postgraphe graphics are generated directly from its knowledge representation language; then text is generated based upon the graphics. Thus, it is not clear whether the language is truly media-independent, i.e., whether it could be used to generate text directly. Also, Postgraphe's language of intentions is less general than our approach of generating presentation plans for achieving communicative goals. For example, in Postgraphe the language can be used to specify the intention to compare two variables of a dataset in a way that emphasizes an increase. In our approach, complex arguments can be planned."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["This paper describes a media-independent knowledge representation scheme, or content language, for describing the content of communicative goals and actions. The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics presentations about complex, quantitative information. To ensure that the language will be applicable to a variety of quantitative domains, it is based upon a corpus analysis of integrated natural language and graphics presentations.
