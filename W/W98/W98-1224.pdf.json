Memory-based learning algorithms do not invest effort during learning in abstract-ing from the tr-lnlng data, such as eager-learning (e.g., decision-tree algorithms, rule-induction, or connectionist-learning algorithms, (Qululan, 1993; Mitchell, 1997)) do. Rather, they defer investing effort until new instances axe presented. On being presented with an instance, a memory-based","*This research was done in the context of the \"Induction of Linguistic Knowledge\" research programme, partially supported by the Foundation for Language Speech and Logic (TSL), which is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). Part of the first author's work was performed at the Department of Computer Science of the Unlversiteit Maastricht. learning algorithm searches for a best-matching instance, or, more generically, a set of the k best-matching instances in memory. Having found such a set of h best-matching instances, the algorithm takes the (majority) class with which the instances in the set axe labeled to be the class of the new instance. Pure memory-based learning algorithms implement the classic k-nearest neighbour algorithm (Cover and Hart, 1967; Devijver and Kittler, 1982; Aha, Kibler, and Albert, 1991); in different contexts, memory-based learning algorithms have also been named lazy, instance-based, exemplar-based, memory-based, case-based learning or reason-ing (Stanfdl and Waltz, 1986; Kolodner, 1993; Aha, Kibler, and Albert, 1991; Aha, 1997))","Memory-based learning has been demonstrated to yield accurate models of various natural language tasks such as grapheme-phoneme conversion, word stress assignment, part-of-speech tagging, and PP-attachment (Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997a). For example, the memory-based learning algorithm ml-IG (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daclemans, Van den Bosch, and We~jters, 1997b), which extends the well-known ml algorithm (Aha, Kibler, and Albert, 1991) with an information-gain weighted similaxity mettic, has been demonstrated to perform adequately and, moreover, consistently and significantly better than eager-lea~'ning algorithms which do invest effort in abstraction during learning (e.g., decision-tree learning (Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997b; Quinlan, 1993), and connectionist learning (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, 1986)) when trained and tested on a range of morphophonological tasks (e.g., morphological segmenta-tion, grapheme-phoneme conversion, syllabitlcation, and word stress assignment) (Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux, 1994; Van den Bosch, Daelemans, and We~jters, 1996; Van den Bosch, 1997). Thus, when learning NLP tasks, the abstraction oeeurnng in decision trees (i.e., the explicit forgetting of information considered to be redundant) and in conneetionist networks (i.e., a non-symbolic encoding and decoding in relatively small numbers of connection van den Bosch and Daelemans 195 Memory-Based Learning of Word Pronunciation Antal van den Bosch and Walter Daelemans (1998) Do Not Forget: Full Memory in Memory-Based Learning of Word Pronunciation. In D.M.W. Powers (ed.) NeMLaP3/CoNLL98: New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, ACL, pp 195-204. weights) both hamper accurate generalisation of the learned knowledge to new material.","These findings appear to contrast with the general assumption behind eager learning, that data representing real-world classification tasks tends to contains (i) redundancy and (ii) exceptions: redundant data can be compressed, yielding smaller descrip-tions of the original data; some exceptions (e.g., low-frequency exceptions) can (or should) be discarded since they are expected to be bad predictors for classhying new (test) material. However, both redundancy and exeeptionality cannot be computed trivially; heuristic functions are generally used to estimate them (e.g., functions from ixLformation theory (Qnlnl~m, 1993)). The lower generalization accuracies of both decision-tree and eonnectionist learning, compared to memory-based learning, on the abovementioned NLP tasks, suggest that these heuristic estimates may not be the best choice for learning NLP tasks. It appears that in order to learn such tasks successfully, a learning algorithm should not forget (i.e., explicitly remove from memory) any information contained in the learning material: it should not abstract from the individual instances.","An obvious type of abstraction that is not harmful for generalisation accuracy (but that is not always acknowledged in implementations of memory-based learning) is the straightforward abstraction from tokens to types with frequency information. In general, data sets representing natural language tasks, when large enough, tend to contain considerable numbers of duplicate sequences mapping to the same output or class. For example, in data representing word pronunciations, some sequences of letters, such as ing at the end of English words, occur hundreds of times, while each of the sequences is pronounced identically, viz. /llJ/. Instead of storing all individual sequence tokens in memory, each set of identical tokens can be safely stored in memory as a single sequence type with frequency information, without loss of generalisation accuracy (Daeleroans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997b). Thus, forgetting instance tokens and replacing them by instance types may lead to considerable computational optlmi~ations of memory-based learning, since the memory that needs to be searched may become considerably smaller •","Given the safe, performance-preserving"]},{"title":"optlmi-e~-","paragraphs":["tion of replacing sets of instance tokens by instance types with frequency information, a next step of investigation into optlmlsing memory-based learning is to measure the effects offorge~ing instance types on grounds of their exceptionality, the underlying idea being that the more exceptional a task instance type is, the more likely it is that it is a bad predictor for new instances. Thus, exceptionality should in some way express the unsuitability of a task instance type to be a best match (nearest neighbour) to new instances: it would be unwise to copy its associated classification to best-matching new instances. In this paper, we investigate three criteria for estimating an instance type's exceptionality, and removing instance types estimated to be the most exceptional by each of these criteria. The criteria investigated are 1. typicality of instance types; 2. class prediction strength of instance types; 3. fi-iendly-neighbourhood size of instance types; 4. random (to provide a baseline experiment).","We base our experiments on a large data set of English word pronunciation. We briefly describe this data set, and the way it is converted into an instance base fit for memotT-based learning, in Section 2. In Section 3 we describe the settings of our experiments and the memory-based learning algorithm IBI-Io with which the experiments are performed. We then turn to describing the notions of typicality, class-prediction strength, and friendly-neighbourhood size, and the functions to estimate them, in Section 4. Section 5 provides the experimental results. In Section 6, we discuss the obtained results and formulate our conclusions. 2 The word-pronunciation data Converting written words to stressed phonemic transcription, i.e., word pronunciation, is a well-known benchmark task in machine learning (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Shavlik, Mooney, and Towell, 1991; Dietterich, Hild, and Baklri, 1990; Wolpert, 1990). We define the task as the conversion of fixed-sized instances representing parts of words to a class representing the phoneme and the stress marker of the instance's middle letter. To genexate the instances, windowing is used (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987). Table I displays example instances and their classifications generated on the basis of the sample word booking. Classificatious, i.e., phonemes with stress markers (henceforth PSs), are denoted by composite labels. For exampie, the first instance in Table 1, -_book, maps to dass labd /b/l, denoting a/b/ which is the first phoneme of a syllable receiving primary stress. In this study, we chose a fixed window width of seven letters, which offers sufficient context information for adequate performance, though extension of the window decreases ambiguity within the data set (Van den Bosch, 1997).","The task, henceforth referred to as Qs (Grapheme-phoneme conversion and stress assignment) is similar to the NBTTALK task presented by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1986), but is performed on a laxger corpus, of 77,565 English word-pronunciation pairs, extracted from the cBr.Bx lexical data base (Burnage, 1990).

While these studies point at back-propagation learning (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, 1986), using distributed output code, as the better pet-former as compared to ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), a symbolic inductive-learning decision tree algorithm (Dietterich, Hild, and Bakid, 1990; Shavllk, Mooney, and Towel], 1991), unless IV3 was equipped with error-correcting output codes and additional manual tweaks (Dietterich, Hild, and Bakiri, 1990). Systematic experiments with the data also used in this paper have indicated that both back-propagation and decision-tree learning (using either distributed or atomic output coding) ate consistently and significantly outperformed by memory-based learning of gmpheme-phoneme conversion, stress assignment, and the combination of the two (Van den Bosch, 1997), using atomic output coding.

In addition to these four experiments, we performed an additional eight experiments using the same percentages, and editing on the basis of (i) instance types' typicality (by ordering them in reverse order) and (il) their in-difference towards typicality or atypicality (i.e., the closeness of their typicality to 1.0, by ordering them in order of the absolute value of their typicality subtracted by 1.0). The experiments with removing typical and boundary instance types provide interesting comparisons with the more intuitive editing of atypical instance types.","Table 2 provides examples of four atypical, boundary, and typical instance types found in the training set.

Several functions for computing class-prediction strength have been proposed, e.g., as a criterion for removing instances in memory-based (k-nn) learning algorithms, such as m3 (Aha, Kibier, and Albert, 1991) (cf. earlier work on edited k-nn (Wilson, 1972; Voisin and Devijver, 1987)); or for weighting instances in the Each[ algorithm (Salzberg, 1990; Cost and Salzberg, 1993). We chose to implement the straightforward class-prediction strength function as proposed in (Salzberg, 1990) in two steps. First, we count (a) the number of times that the instance type is the nearest neighbour of another instance type, and (b) the number of occurrences that when the instance type is a neareat neighbour of another instance type, the classes of the two instances match. Second, the instance's class-prediction strength is computed by taking the ratio of (b) over (a). An instance type with class-prediction strength 1.0 is a perfect predictor of its own class; a class-prediction strength of 0.0 indicates that the instance type is a bad predictor of classes of other instances, presumably indicating that the instance type is exceptional.","We computed the class-prediction strength of all instance types in the training set, ordered the instance types according to their strengths, and created edited training sets with 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the instance types with the lowest class prediction strength removed, respectively. In Table 3, four sample instance types axe displayed which have elass-prediction strength 0.0, i.e., the lowest possible strength. They are never a correct nearest-ncighbour match, since they all have higher-frequency counterpart types with the same feature values. For example, the letter sequence _ algo occurs in two types, one associated with the pronunciation /'~/ (via., primary-stressed /re/, or lm in our labelling), as in algorithm and algorithms; the other associated with the pronunciation /'~/(viz. secondary-stressed /~/ or 2se), as in algorithmic. The latter instance type occurs less frequently than the former, which is the reason that the class of the former is preferred over the latter.

Given a training set of instance types, for each instance type a ranking can be made oral] of its nearest neighbours, ordered by their distance to the instance type. The number of neaxest-neighbouz instance types in this ranking with the same class, henceforth refe~ed to as the frendly-neighbourhood size, may range between 0 and the total number of instance types of the same class. When the friendly neighbourhood is empty, the instance type only has neaxest neighbouts of different classes. The argumentation to regard a small friendly neighbourhood as an indication of an instance type's exceptionality, follows f~om the same argumentation as used with e!~s-prediction strength: when an instance type has nearest neighbours of different classes, it is vice versa a bad predictor for those classes. Thus, the smaller an instance type's friendly neighboaxhood, the more it could be regarded exceptional.","To illustrate the computation of frend]yneighbou~hood size, Table 4 lists fou~ examples of possible neaxest-neighbou~ zankings (truncated at ten nearest neighbours) with their respective number of friendly neighbours.

The upward curve of the line graph denoting the experiments with random selection indeed shows degrading per-formanee with increasing numbers of left-out instance types. The relative decrease in generalisation accuracy is 2.0% when 1% of the training material is removed randomly, 3.8% with 2% random removal, 10.7% with 5% random removal, and 20.7% with 10% random removal.","Surprisingly, the only experiments showing lower performance degradation than removal by random selection are those with class-prediction strength; the other criteria for removing exceptional instances lead to worse degradations. It does not matter whether instance types are removed on grounds of their typicality: apparently, a markedly low, neutral, or high typicality value indicates that the instance type is (on average) important, rather than removable. The same applies to friendly-neighbourhood size: instances with small neighbourhood sizes appear to contribute significantly to performance on test material. It is remarkable that the largest errors with 1% and 2% removal are obtained with the friendly-neighbourhood size criterion: it appears that on average, the instances with few or no nearest neighbours are important in the classification of test material.","When using class-prediction strength as removal criterion, performance does not degrade until about 5% of the instance types with the lowest strength are removed from memory. The reason is that c|_~ss-prediction strength is the only criterion that detects minority ambiguities, i.e., instance types with prediction strength 0.0, that cannot contribute to classification since they are always overshadowed by their counterpart instance types with majority classes, even for their own classification. In the tralni~g set, 9,443 instance types are minority ambiguities, i.e., 4.2% of the instance types (accounting for 3.8% of the instance tokens in the original token set).","Thus, among the tested methods for reducing the memory needed for storing an instance base in memory-based learning, only two relatively trivial methods are performance-preserving while account-ing for a substantial reduction in the amount of","memory needed by IB 1-IG:","1. Replacing instance tokens by instance types accounts for a reduction of about 63% of memory needed to store instances, excluding the memory needed to store frequency information. When frequency information is stored in two bytes per instance type, the memory reduction is about 54%.",". Removing instance types that are minority ambigulties on top of the type/token-reduction accounts only for an additional memory reduction of 2%, i.e., for a total memory reduction of 65%; 56% with two-byte frequency information stored per instance. 6 Discussion and future research As previous research has suggested (Daelemans, 1996; Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997a; Van den Bosch, 1997), keeping full memory in memory-based learning of word pronunciation strongly appears to yield optimal generalisation accuracy. The experiments in this paper show that optimi~tion of memory use in memory-based learning while preserving generalisation accuracy can only be performed by (i) replacing instance tokens by instance types with frequency information, and (ii) removing minority ambiguities. Both optimi~tions can be performed straightforwardly; minority ambiguities can be traced with less effort than by using class-prediction strength. Our implementation of IB1-I6 described in (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997b) already makes use of this knowledge, albeit partially (it stores class distributions with letter-window types).","Our results also show that atypicality, non-typicality, and typicality (Zhang, 1992), and friendly-neighbourhood size are all estimates of exceptionality that indicate the importance of instance types for classification, rather than their removability. As far as these estimates of exeeptionality are viable, our results suggest that exceptions should be kept in memory and not be thrown away. van den Bosch and Daelemans 201 Memory-Based Learning of Word Pronunciation 12.0 11.0"]},{"title":"o~","paragraphs":["v 10.0 (D tO 9.0 ._~ v 8.0, t- (D 7.0 6.0","atypical o • typical ......","non-typical --~ ....","small neighbourhood .* ......","low prediction strength ....... \" / x","• random -.. .... ._.~ ........ :::::::::::::::::::::::::..","......................... : ..... ~:::::~-. ......","......","...","\"","I","...0..",".o\"",".","....",".","......",".",".............. 5 00 10000 15000 20000 number of removed instances types Figure 1: Generallsation errors (percentages of incorrectly classified test instances of TRIBL-IG, with increased numbers of edited instances, according to the tested exeeptionality criteria atypical, typical, boundary, small neighbourhood, low prediction strength, and random selection.

Lazy vs. eager; not stable vs. unstable","F~om the results in this paper and those reported eatlier (Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997a; Van den Bosch, 1997), it appeats that no compromise can be made on memory-base learning in terms of abstraction by forgetting without los-ing generalisation accuracy. Consistently lower per-formances axe obtained with algorithms that forget by constructing decision trees or connectionist networks, or by editing instance types. Generalisation accuracy appears to be related to the dimension lazy-eager leaxning; for the Gs task (and for many other language tasks, (Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijtezs, 1997a)), it is demonstrated that memory-based lazy leatning leads to the best generalisation accuracies,","Another explanation for the difference in performance between decision-tree, connectionist, and editing methods versus pure memory-based leaxning is that the former generally display high ~ar/- ance, which is the portion of the generalisation error caused by the u~tabili~/of the learning algorithm (Breiman, 1996a). An algorithm is unstable when small perturbations in the learning material lead to large differences in induced models, and stable othezwise; pure memory-based learning algorithms axe said to be very stable, and decision-tree algorithms and conneetionist learning to be unstable (Breiman, 1996a). High variance is usually coupled with low bias, i.e., unstable leaxning algorithms with high vaziance tend to have few limitations in the fxeedom to approximate the task or function to be leaxned) (Bzeiman, 1996b). Breiman points out that often the opposite also holds: a stable classitiez with a low variance can display a high bias when it cannot represent data adequately in its available set of models, but it is not cleat whether or how this applies to pure memory-based leatning as in ml-IG; its success in representing the Gs data and other language tasks quite adequately would rather suggest that IB 1-I6 has both low vatiance and low bias. Apatt fzom the possibility that the lazy and eager leatning algorithms investigated here and in eatllez work do not have a strongly contrasting bias, we conjecture that the editing methods discussed here, and some specific decision-tree leaxning algorithms investigated eaxlier (i.e., IGTItEE (Daclemuns, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997b), a decision tree learning algorithm that is an approximate optimisation of IBI-IG) have a slmilat vatia~lce to that of IB1-IG; they axe virtually as stable as ~I-IQ. We base this conjecture on the fact that the standard deviations of both decision-tree learning and memory-based learning trained and tested on the GS data axe not only very small (in the order of 1/10 percents), but also hatdiy different (cf. (Van den Bosch, 1997) for details and examples). Only counectionist networks trained with back-propagation and decision-tree leaxning with pruning display latger standard deviations when accuracies ate averaged over exper-van den Bosch and Daelemans 202 Memory-Based Learning of Word Pronunciation"]},{"title":"II II I I I I I I l I I I I I I l / / / / / / l / / / / A","paragraphs":["iments (Van den Bosch, 1997); the stable-unstable dimension might play a role there, but not in the difference between pure memory-based learning and edited memory-based learning.","Future research","The results of the present study suggest that","the following questions be investigated in future re-","search:",", The tested criteria for editing can be employed as instance weights as in EACH (Salzberg, 1990) and PEI3LS (Cost and Salzberg, 1993), rather than as criteria for instance removal.

Different data sets of different sizes may contain different portions of atypical instances or minority ambiguities. Moreover, data sets may contain pure noise. While atypical or exceptional instances may (and do) return in test material, the chances of noise to return is relativdy minute. Our results generalise to data sets with approximately the characteristics of the Gs dataset. Although there are indica-tions that data sets representing other language tasks indeed share some essential characteristics (e.g., memory-based learning is consistently the best-performlng algorithm), more investigation is needed to make these characteristics explicit.
