We first introduce a database system called FreeNet that facilitates the description and exploration of finite binary relations. We then describe the design and implementation of Lexical FreeNet, a semantic network that mixes WordNet-derived semantic relations with data-derived and phonetically-derived relations. We discuss how Lexical FreeNet has aided in lexical discovery, the pursuit of linguistic and factual knowledge by the computer-aided exploration of lexical relations. 1 Motivation This paper discusses Lexical FreeNet, a database system designed to enhance lexical discovery. By this we mean the pursuit of linguistic and factual knowledge with the computer-aided exploration of lexical relations. Lexical FreeNet is a semantic network that leverages WordNet and other knowledge and data sources to facilitate the discovery of nontrivial lexical connections between words and concepts.","A semantic network allied with the proper user interface can be a useful tool in its own right. By organizing words semantically rather than alphabetically, WordNet provides a means by which users can navigate its vocabulary logically, establishing connections between concepts and not simply character sequences. Exploring the WordNet hyponym tree starting at the word mammal, for instance, reveals to us that aardvarks are mammals; exploring WordNet's meronym relation at the word tv, mr*al reveals to us that mammals have hair. From these two explorations we can accurately conclude that aardvarks have hair.","Lexical exploration need not be limited to one step at a time, however. Viewing a semantic network as a computational structure awaiting graph-theoretic queries gives us the freedom to demand services be-yond mete lookup. \"Does the aardvark have hair?\", or \"What is the closest connection between aardvarks and hair?\" or \"How interchangably can the words aardvark and anteater be used?\" are all reasonable questions with answers staring us in the"]},{"title":"135","paragraphs":["face. Of course, the idea of finding shortest paths in semantic networks (through so-called activationspreading or intersection search) is not new. But these questions have typically been asked of very limited graphs, networks for domains far narrower than the lexical space of English, say. We feel that formalizing how WordNet can be employed for this broader sort of lexical discovery is a good start. We also feel that it is necessary first to enrich the network with information that, as we shall see, cannot be easily gleaned from WordNet's current battery of relations. The very large electronic corpora and wide variety of linguistic resources that today's comput-ing technology has enabled will in turn enable this.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We shall first describe in Section 2 the FreeNet database system for the expression and analysis of relational data. In Section 3 we'll describe the design and construction of an instance of this database called Lexical FreeNet. We'll conclude by providing examples of applications of Lexical FreeNet to lexical discovery. 2 FreeNet FreeNet, an acronym for finite relation expression network, is a system for describing and exploring finite binary relations. Here we mean relation in the mathematical sense, i.e. a set of ordered pairs. We concern ourselves with finite sets of pairs of tokens drawn from a finite set of tokens, or vocabulary. 2.1 Tokens and relations A token in FreeNet is simply a normalized string of characters drawn from a finite vocabulary. The vocabulary might be a dictionary of English words, a set of movie titles, or a set of names of researchers. The system is assumed to implement normalization as a function from input strings to strings.","A relation in FreeNet is a finite set of ordered pairs of tokens, or links. Each relation has a name that, like a token, is simply a normalized string of characters drawn from a finite vocabulary (which we shall do better to call an alphabet, for reasons made clear below.)","Use of the FreeNet system can be seen to consist of three distinct processing phases: the relation computation stage, in which a set of relations is derived from some knowledge or data source and transduced to an explicit set of labeled ordered pairs; the graph construction stage, in which this set of labeled pairs Is transduced to an efficient multigraph representation; and the query stage, in which a user can interact with the system to find paths in the multigraph that match a certain specification.","FreeNet consists of software to do the second and third phases. Implementation of a specific instance of FreeNet requires the user to write software to do the first phase, but support software exists for an optional filtering substage that constrains the input pair set in certain ways--eliminating pairs that contain stopwords, enforcing limits on the fanout of tokens, and enforcing strength thresholds, for instance.","The second phase, graph building, simply entails providing a set of triples {two tokens and a relation) to the system. The order in which the triples appear in the input does not matter, as it is the program's responsibility to reorder the links as necessary and to store the graph efficiently.","The third phase, querying, is the chief novel contribution, and is described below. 2.2 Regular expressions The power behind FreeNet lies in the user's ability to compose primitive relations to build more complex relations that it may use in its queries.","The primary mechanism for building complex relations is the regular expression over the alphabet of relation names. Just as a regular expression over ASCII characters specifies a regular set of strings recursively in terms of other sets, so too can a regular expression over relation names specify a set of ordered pairs recursively in terms of other sets and various operators.","The following grammar specifies allowable regular expressions in FreeNet. regexp \"","<re1> (relation name) I (regexp) (parenthesization) regexp regexp (concatenation) regexp J regexp (union) regexpk regexp (conjunction) regexp, (transitive closure) regexp' (inverse) regexp- (complement) regexpX (sibling)","These regexp-building operators are described below. Concatenation The concatenation operator is used to compose two relations directly. The expression rl r2 denotes the set of pairs (a,b) such that for some token c, (a,c) E rl and (c,b) E r2. For example, a network implementing a genealogy database might of-fer primitive parent and brother relations. In that case, the relation denoted by the regular expression {parent brother) is what we know of as the uncle relation. 136 Conjunction Conjunction takes the intersection of two relations: plainly, the intersection of their respective pair sets. The expression rl • r2 denotes the set of pairs (a, b) such that (a, b) E rl and (a, b) E r2.","Supposing that in a lexical semantic net we have the relations required_by and requires, then a symmetric symbiotic_with relation might be implemented as their conjunction. Union The union operator is used to join two relations. The expression rl I r2 denotes the set of pairs (a,b) such that (a,b) E rl or (a,b) E r2. In an ErdSs-number like application, for example, two authors may be \"related\" if they have coauthored a paper or if one has cited the other. Transitive closure We commonly reason about the transitive closure of relations. The transitive closure operator implements homogeneous reachability--is there a path between the tokens using links only of a certain type? Namely, let r'l denote the relation r and r'i for i > 1 denote the relation (r r'(i-1)). Then r* denotes the union of all r'i as i ranges from 0 to infinity. (Note that since we assume finite relations, this set is always finite.) In the genealogy example, paxenc* would be what we consider the \"ancestor\" relation. Inverse, Complement, and Sibling A few more unary operators are minor conveniences in building relations. The inverse operator swaps every pair: r- denotes the set of pairs (a,b) such that (b.a) E r. Taking the union of a relation with its inverse produces a new relation that is guaranteed to be symmetric.","The complement operator produces a set contain-ing all pairs but those in a certain relation, r' denotes the set of pairs (a, b) such that (b, a) ~r. (The vocabulary is assumed to be fixed after the graph is built, and so the universe is well-defined.)","The sibling operator produces pairs that have in common their relation with a certain other token. rX denotes the set of pairs (a, b) such that a ~ b and there exists a c such that (a,c) E r and (b,c) E r. Thus (parent-)~, relation is the genealogical sibling relation formed by applying the inverse operator and then the sibling operator to the \"parent\" relation. Note A simple structural induction can be used to prove that any relation built from these operators is also a relation. Additional operators to support set addition and subtraction of constant pair sets are also available. 2.3 Queries Queries in FreeNet are path specifications expressed as a sequence of tokens or token variables with interleaved relation regexps. More precisely, every query is ofthe form (W <regexp>)* W. where W is either a"]},{"title":"i I","paragraphs":["/.i-"]},{"title":"I I I I I","paragraphs":["-y constant token or a variable wi, and <regexp> is a regular expression over relations, as defined above.","FreeNet returns a shortest path (or all paths) in the multigraph that match the query, binding the variables in the query to concrete tokens. The output includes the names of all of the primitive relation links traversed.","Queries in the Internet version of FreeNet can take one of four forms, each parameterized by one or two tokens; but these demonstrate what are expected to be common queries. Below, the \"ANY\" regexp is the union of all available (or selected) primitive relations. The comma (\",') represents the universal relation, linking all pairs of tokens; the comma relation can thus be used in FreeNet queries to implement conjunction of clauses.","• Shortest path: This query takes two arguments s and t, and outputs the result of the query \"s ANY* t'. This finds a shortest path, using any of the selected relations, between the source and the target.","• Fanout: This query takes a single argument s and outputs the result of \"s ANY wz\". This simply shows all words related in some way to the source.","• Intersection search: This query takes two arguments s and t and outputs the result of \"s AI~ wl , t t.tlY wt'. This is useful for finding what two tokens \"have in common\" in terms of primitive relationships with other tokens. The two relations involved in such a path need not be identical.","• Coercion: This query takes two arguments s and t, two relations rel and re2, and outputs the result of\"s rot wt re2 w2 ret t\". This is useful for a wide variety of constraint-solving, such as, in the lexical semantic net case, pun and rhyme generation. 2.4 Implementation issues A FreeNet multigraph is stored sparsely for efficient ofltine (disk) access as a list of variable-length adjacency lists. Each element in an adjacency list is a single 32-bit word that describes an arc by combining its destination token ID and relation ID; the source token ID for an arc is implicit in its row. An index of offsets into the list is precomputed and stored together with hash tables for the token and relation namespaces. At no point in query processing is more than a single line of the list (equivalently, a set of links emanating from the same source node) in memory at once. Graph construction A number ofoptimizations in the layout of the multigraph on disk are essential if arbitrary searches over large multigraphs are to be efficient. Of particular concern is disk seek time, because traversing the graph entails accessing different rows of the adjacency list representation in rapid succession. One simple preprocessing step is to sort each row of the'","137 representation by the word identifier's row location, so that all of the nodes emanating from a fixed source can be accessed wixth a unidirectional sweep.","A trickier concern is the ordering of the rows themselves. We desire to order the rows so that related words tend to appear near each other so that seek time between them is minimized. We can for-malize this problem by asking for an ordering that minimizes the average offset difference between a randomly chosen edge in the multigraph. This problem is at least as computationally hard as the wellstudied, NP-complete bandwidth problem in graph theory (Papadimitriou, 1076), which is to find a linear ordering of the vertices of a given graph such that the maximum difference in the ordering between any two adjacent vertices is minimal. We are studying approximation algorithms (Blum et al., to appear) that allow this preprocessing step to be carried out efficiently during database construction. Querying Supporting arbitrary FreeNet queries that allow the full range of regular expression operators, is a nontrivial data structures problem, because it is prohibitively expensive to add new links with the occurrence of a new regexp. Instead, the graph is static. Each relation in the \"alphabet\" of relations is converted to an ASCII character, and stock regexp .processing software is used to convert each regexp m a query to a state machine. A query is converted to a single state machine by concatenating its constituent regexp state machines, interleaving \"constraint points\" that enforce the identity of multiple bindings of the same variable. A dynamic set of state IDs and backtrace IDs is associated with each token to support breadth-first search.","The query templates above are implemented without all this machinery, by simply performing breadth-first-search on the graph, maintaining a single backtrace ID for each node, and allowing or prohibiting certain relations as specified by the user. Coercion is implemented as a hard-coded path constraint."]},{"title":"3 Lexical FreeNet","paragraphs":["Lexical FreeNet is an instance of FreeNet supporting a range of lexical semantic applications.

To allow users to cross the dimensions of sound and meaning in their queries, two phonetic relations are added to the mix in Lexical FreeNet.

This is perhaps best described as a \"wormhole\" in lexical space. Extensions A portion of the wealth of WordNet was discarded in Lexical FreeNet--the verb entailment relation, for instance.

One approach (Richardson, 1997; Richardson et al., 1993) bootstraps a parser to induce many unconventional semantic relations from dictionary data. A link grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1991) applied to data can conceivably be used to extract some in-teresting relations that live at the syntax/semantics interface. 4 Lexical discovery A World Wide Web interface to Lexical FreeNet, depicted in Figure 3, is available and has become a popular online resource since its release in late January, 1998.:. The program allows the user to issue one of the four template queries to the database do scribed in Section 2.3. One of these query templates (\"Fanout\") requires only a single source token as input, and this has become a popular lookup tool, providing some of the functionality of a thesaurus and rhyming dictionary. The other query functions require source and target tokens to be specified. Each token can itself contain spaces in the case of phrasal inputs, which are normalized to the underscore character in processing. The four basic queries allow the user to specify a subset of the ten primitives relations to permit in the output paths by clicking a series of checkboxes. Upon submission, the state of the checkboxes sets the ANY relation to be the union of checked relations.","An additional \"Spell check\" query mode allows the user to find database tokens that have similar (or exact) spelling to a given input token, where similarity is measured by an orthographic edit distance.","Upon submission, the system finds and displays the path or paths resulting from the query with arrow glyphs representing the various relations. Queries typically finish within an acceptable time window of three to ten seconds. The results screen summarizes the query and allows the user to resubmit it with modifications, improving the ease of database \"navigation\" over having to return to the title screen.","Feedback from the Web site indicates that the system has been used as an aid in writing poetry and lyrics; devising product names; generating puzzles for elementary school language arts classes; writing greeting cards; devising insults and compliments; and, above all, just exploring. Following are selected examples of the system's output in various configurations. Shortest path queries The shortest path query is the primary vehicle for establishing connections between words and concepts:","• Shortest path queries that allow all lexical relations can be used to aid in generating puns 2See http://~w.link.cs.cmu.edu/lexfn/"]},{"title":"I I L=xical FreeNet","paragraphs":["Lee ~'m I~ ~ me e~:e ~I '---~- I-'F\"----~,--~------,-, - Figure 3: The front page of the Web interface to Lexical FreeNet and quips involving the two endpoint concepts. For example, below is the shortest path between Clinton and Lewinsky using all relations:","CLINTON ~ HOUSE ~ CABIN KACZYNSKI ~:~ LEWINSKY","• Shortest path queries allowing only the hyponomy relations can connect any two nouns in the WordNet hyponymy tree through their least common ancestor. For example, animals can be connected taxonomically, as in the shortest path between porto and langur using only the specialization (:~) and generalization (~:~) and relations:","POTT0 ~ LEMUR ~ PRIMATE ~ MONKEY OLD_WORLD_MONKEY :~ LANGUR","• Shortest path queries allowing only the meronomy relations can connect many noun pairs. For example, geographical connections can be made between place names to find the largest enclosing region, as in the shortest path between Saskatoon and Winnipeg using only the comprise (~::~) and part-of (=~;) relations:","SASKAT00N ~ SASKATCHENAN ~ CANADA MANITOBA ~ WINNIPEG","• It is counter-intuitive but true that most common words can be connected using only the synonym relation (~*::~).
