Each theory in it may contain axioms, definitions, theorems along with proofs, as well as proof methods, and Control rules how to apply proof methods.","• A proof of a theorem is represented in a hierarchical data structure called proof plan data structure :(PDS). The PDS makes explicit the various levels of abstraction by providing several justifications for a single proof node, where each justification belongs to a different lexiel of abstraction. The least abstract level corresponds to a proof in Gentzen's natural deduction (ND) calculus [Gentzen, 1935]. Candidates for higher levels are:proof plans, where justifications are mainly given by more abstract proof methods that belong to the theorem's mathematical theory or to an ancestor theory thereof. An example for a PDS is given below on the left. Each line consists of four elements (label, antecedent, succedent, and justification) and describes a node in the PDS. The label is used as a reference for the node. The antecedent is a list of labels denoting the hypotheses under which the formula in the node, the succedent, holds, a This relation between antecedent and succedent is denoted by F-.
