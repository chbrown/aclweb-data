In general, the goals are to convey important generalisations (e.g. \"Organic jewellery tends to have natural themes\") and to dispel important misconceptions (e.g. \"Jewellery tends to be made of expensive materials\").• These important points have to be brought in appropriately during the description of the exhibits which are selected by the visitor.","• In order to see how a human being tackles such complex goals, we performed a \"CuratOr of Oz\" experiment, • in which we chose an arbitrary sequence of exhibits:in the 20th Century Jewellery gallery of the National Museum of Scotland and asked the curator to give Us a commentary. The curator intro~luced general points/themes suggested by the Objects, moving from the objects to the general issues surrounding them, using the objects merely as an excuse to introduce these topics, for instance as in the following (\"V\" indicates the visitor and \"C\" the curator): V: \"There's a set of three objects here?' C: \"What these symbolise for me are the preoccupations of the 1980's with .... \" She reinforced points from the past, exploiting an excuse to come back to an important point that has already been made and show its relevance in a new situation: _~ V: C: She also \"This one here...\" \"Yes, you've made a link with the first piece that we looked at, which is the idea of a jewel which is also a work of art and a sculpture...\" made links to previous items, thereby improving the continuity of the discourse:","C: \"... and it was work like this which directly inspired work like the Roger Morris brooch on the stand which we looked at earlier.\" : 29 All of these can be regarded as ways of exploiting opportunities offered by the situation.","There is nothing like a conventional schema structure to the descriptions produced. The approach looks a lot more like puttingtogether arbitrary pieces of interesting material subject to only very loose retrictions. This may not be the best way to produce a carefully-argued'written text, and clearly the result is not always fluent according to stringent criteria. In some but not all--respects, it resembles the Unplanned discourses discussed by [Ochs 79]. Furthermore, in the interactive and•relatively informal setting of a museum tour, it works.","We thus decided that ILEX should have a whole set of goals about things tosay.

Basically the ILEX task agenda at each point consists of the facts that the system knows which have not yet been conveyed to the user. Each of these 'tasks' has an opportunity value (its educational value, assumed interest to the reader and contribution to coherence). At each point of the discourse, we 'perform tasks' (include facts) which provide the highest opportunity gain. 3.1 The Content Potential The facts of our knowledge base are interconnected in various ways, and to facilitate content selection and structuring, we organise the facts into a content potential - a graph of facts interconnected in terms of thematic and rhetorical relations. The content potential is an intermed.iary stage between the knowledge base and text, motivated in a similar way to DRSs [Kamp 81] by the desire explicitly to represent the selection of possible knowledge structures that can be reflected linguistically. ;As Figure 1 shows, the content potential forms a three-tiered structure of entities, • facts and relations. There are links between items in adjoining tiers, but no links within a tier or between entities and relations. We now discuss the three tiers in turn. 3.1.1 Entities Entities are the participants in facts (things and qualities in terms of Penman's Upper Model). Entities may be of two kinds: specific entities - such as an individual jewel or person; and gener/c entities - an entity representing some class of entities, such as Scottish jewellers, or art-deco brooches. Generic entities are treated essentially in the same way as specific entities in the content potential, for purposes such as the tracking of focus, anaphor generation, and so on. 3.1.2 Facts Facts represent the relations between entities, in both events (e.g., X made Y), and states (e.g., X owns Y). In ILEX, we have assumed that all facts are binary (simple relations between two entities), e.g., made-by(J-9999, K±ng01) represents the fact that the designer King made item • 31 • E~'ITIES"]},{"title":"I ojo o, ,o,ol I","paragraphs":["~'~ dcco jcwcl Ito be mad¢ ofe..m¢~ made of enamct S~tcllitc'k _-'Prccond ~:---. /Nuclcus . RELATIONS Figure 2: The Concession Relation J-9999. The binary assumption simplifies our architecture, allowing quicker text generation. At a later stage, we may allow more complex fact-representation. Complex sentences can be formed through aggregating together these binary facts. Each fact has the following fields: 2 Pred : The name of the Predicate connecting the two entities.","Argl : The entity in the relationship which the fact is primarily about. For instance, \"J-999 was designed by •Jessie King\" is primarily about J-999, not about King.","Arg2 : The other entity in the relationship. This is sometimes another thing (such as \"Jessie King\") and Sometimes a quality. Various other fields exist which detail the polarity, defeasibility, interest, importance and assimilation Of the •fact. Facts representing general principles or negations of general misconceptions are expressed using generi c entities and can be included in a text just like any other facts. • 3.1.3 Relations • • Relation nodes represent relations between facts.

The content potential represents the information we can express, and the interconnectivity of information. When we receive the resquest for an entity description, the planner sets that entity as the global focus of the current page. Opportunistic planning then commences: The facts directly Connected to that entity represent opportunities: the system can coherently include these facts in the text. •If any of these facts are actually selected, then new opportunities are created in two ways: Entity-based moves: From the fact, we go to the argument which we didn't enter the fact from. We then select anew fact reachable from this node. See Figure 3. If we followed the Arg2 role of a fact, then we are in a sense selecting a new focus (local focus). The facts we generate about this entity should have the new entity as the • focus. Thus in the example, King becomes the Theme of the second sentence.

These values are moderated by a third fact annotation:","Assimilation. the degree to which the fact is assumed known to the user, either from general knowledge, or through prior mentions in the web interaction (these values change dynamically).","The three values interest, importance and (1 - assimilation) are multiplied together to calculate the local score of each fact. The overall opportunity value of a fact is the product of the local score of the fact, the overall opportunity value of the parent (the node through which it was reached) and a weight for the relation between them. It is the overall opportunity values that axe used to select which textual opportunities to follow. We have no special theory about where interest and importance come from, though the above examples suggest that there may be domain- and user-type-specific rules that can be used to derive some of them.","In Summary, content-determination in ILEX is seen as the task of optimising the selection of opportunities that are offered by the topic of the text, subject to not moving too far from that topic. The result of content-determination is a connected subgraph of the content potential (Figure 5). The use of interest and importance in ILEX is analogous to theuse of \"salience\" in [McDonald and Conklin 82]. Because the process is seen as a graph traversal problem, there are als0 similarities with work on generating text from semantic networks [Simmons and Slocum 72, Sibun 92]. In a sense, our work aims to combine the best of both. 3.3 Text Planning Although the process of content determination has worked through a number of moves that may be made in the generated text, the result is not the kind of tree structure that one needs for realisation and also has been influenced only by local considerations of coherence. Text planning therefore requires the following two steps:","I. Extend the subgraph to a complete subgraph that includes all the relations linking the selected fact nodes.","34 •","•",".",".. .o~o,~a.. q o. q \" a, m ux • 11 I ~TITIES FACTS R£L~TIONS Figure 5: Result of Content Determination","2.

Again this involves exploiting opportunities. For in-","•stance, in order to avoid an awkward focus shift at some point, one might attempt to include a selec-","ted fact about a new entity immediately after another one that mentions the same entity. Other text","• planning operations that are opportunistic in nature include aggregation [Dalianis and Hovy 96]","and redundancy suppression [McDonald 92], though we will not consider these here. The second step described above is exactly that described by [Marcu 97]. That is, one is given","a set of facts all of which should be included in a text and a set of relations between facts, some","of which can be included in the text. The task is to produce a legal RS tree using the facts and","some relations (or the \"best\" such tree). Marcu's approach first of all attempts to find the best","ordering 0f the facts. For every relation that could be indicated, constraints are generated saying","what the order of the two facts involved should be and that the facts should be adjacent. The","Constraints are weighted accord!ng to attributes of rhetorical relations that have been determined","empirically. A standard constraint satisfaction algorithm is used to find the linear sequence such","that the total weight of the satisfied constraints is maximal. Once the sequence of facts is known,","a general algo~thm is used to construct all possible RS trees based on those facts. We could use Marcu's methods directly, but are exploring more widely because we would like","to take into account a wider range of preference criteria, develop algorithms that treat entity-based","elaborations rather differently from other rhetorical relations [Oberlander et al 98] and investigate","heuristic approaches that wilt scale up better. We are currently experimenting with •three different","algorithms for building an RST tree. These are all opportunistic in nature, rather than being","strongly goal-directed or schema-based:","1. The RS tree (realised depth-first) is built to directly reflect the tree of nodes explored (breadth=first) in the content potential.","2. The best trees up to a fixed depth using relational moves are constructed; these are \"glued ''• together using entity based moves [Oberlander et al 98].","3. A genetic algorithm is used to search for a legal tree that is of as high quality as possible [Mellish et al 98].
