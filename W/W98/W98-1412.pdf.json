Their effects emerge from the pragmatic model of the generation system so that the generated text s satisfy these maxims. The texts should be a true characterization of a state of affairs, they should be as informative as possible, relevant, and perspicuous. While the first three maxims are related to what is said, the last maxim is related to how it is said. The category of perspicuity principles includes constraints on avoiding obscurity and ambiguity, or being brief and orderly. It is anything but clear how these principles should be interpreted precisely. Several attempts have been • made to remedy this in computational work on generating texts that best satisfy these maxims, especially with respect to the generation of referring expressions (e.g. [Dale et al. 95]).","However, there is•more to pragmatics than satisfying Gricean maxims. In particular, the category of perspicuity principles does not usually cover the important fact that texts are tailored toa specific addressee, not only in content,• i.e., with respect to her or his informational needs, but also in the linguistic form, i.e., word order, syntactic constructions, the choice of lexical items, and eventually prosodic information. This tailoring of the linguistic form to the listener is termed \"information structuring\". In generating texts, information Structuring requires, among other things, the use of some listener model, which may include information about the listener's knowledge, goals, properties, etc.","LinguiStic approaches to describing the principles of information structuring have sometimes characterized information structure as an instruction to the listener about how to construct a model of the communicated state of affairs [Prince 81]~ In AI and Computational Linguistics, tailoring the message to the","• - .

Suppose the purpose of a generation system is to describe a spatial scenario. One of the sentences might be (1) Behind the town hall is a BAKERY. with \"bakery\" the prosodically most prominent constituent"]},{"title":"(the focus exponent).","paragraphs":["In this sentence; the prepo- \" sitional phrase \"behind the town hall\" functions as topic and the noun phrase \"a bakery\" is in focus, we will ignore aspects of focus and its role in language generation, especially since selecting the focus exponent is better understood as being part of utterance planning, and are limiting our attention to the topic/comment-structure only. The topic provides familiar discourse referents whose properties are further illuminated by the sentence; the relation between these discourse referents and the sentential predication is also referred to as an aboutness-relation. Many languages possess special topicalization constructions or morphological markers to single out the topic in a sentence. In German (and probably English as well), referring phrases provide topicreferents, and the clause-initial position is their preferred position. Thus clause-initial positioning is the most important topic-relevant feature in generation. 2","The same propositional content expressed by (1) can be realized with different information structures and, therefore, different sentence forms, as the following English examples demonstrate: (2) A bakery is behind the town hall. (3) Behind the town hall, there is a bakery. (4) As for the town hal!, behind it is a bakery.","Discourse referents functioning as topics must be identifiable for the listener. This is the reason why","topics are usually packaged as definite noun phrases, or as prepositional phrases that contain definite noun","~hrases. Topic candidates will be selected from the set of discourse referents that the listener knows accord-","ing to a topic acceptance scale. [Lambrecht 94] proposes the following scale: .","(5) active > accessible (textually, situationally, or inferentially) > unused > brand-new anchored > brand-new unanchored Active referents are those that are currently lit up; they are in the center of attention. They are the most acceptable topics because the listener's mental effort needed for processing the respective sentence is-minimal as compared with the effort needed to identify and anchor an unfamiliar or inactive topic referent. We consider the candidates below the accessible referents to be inappropriate as topics in most instances, and we limit our attention to a scale with three regions: active referents, accessible referents, and inaccessible referents.","To summarize, the first task in generating texts with sentences with appropriate topic/comment structures is to determine for each sentence the topic discourse referent. This referent should be identifiable for the listener and as high on the topic acceptance scale as possible. The phrase expressing the topic should I Depending on one's theoretical background and/or affiliation with different schools, terminology differs considerably. 2[Ahmann 81, 150] gives ~?ome counterexamples to this default.

Hence, we need a mechanism to handle this kind of uncertainty.","This is of course not the whole story of topic-hood. In addition to selecting topic referents, we have to • solve the problem of how one and the same topic/comment structure can be realized by-different syntactic structures. German examples resembling the previous three ones are:","(6) Die Vitrine steht rechts vonder Lampe. \" ~ 'The Showcase is standing to the fight of the lamp.\" (subject realization)","(7) Die Vitrine, die steht rechts yon der Lampe. \"The showcase, it is standing to the right of the lamp?

All.three examples express the same propositional content, viz. the localization of a uniquely identifiable showcase with respect to a uniquely identifiable •lamp. Furthermore, all three examples exhibit the same topic/comment structure: \"the Showcase\" functions as topic, i.e., the anchor for the proposition, and the rest of the clause comments on certain aspects of the showcase.

We propose an abductive setting in the spirit of [Hobbs et al. 93] as a framework for integrating the diverse knowledge sources involved in the generation and interpretation of sentential information structure. The basic idea is 6a view generating a single proposition as finding the best proof for why a sentence and its information structure is congruent with the listener model.

For present purposes we assume that thepropositional content of a sentence has already been established. What remains to be done is to construct a pragmatically appropriate sentence that conveys the new and informative part of this propositional information to the listener.

To make precise what counts as a good explanation, one introduces a preference criterion by which alternative explanations can be compared. A preferred explanation for an observation might be the least specific one, the most specific one, the one with the lowest proof costs, etc. Abductive explanation is classically characterized as follows (C f. [Mayer et al. 96]): a knowledge base K, the usual consequence relation ~, and an observation E to be explained, such that K t~ E, are given.

Recently, abductive reasoning has also• been proposed for use in generation, partly for planning [Lascarides et al. 92, Thomason et al. 96], and as a framework for both the interpretation and the generation of discourse [Thomasonet al. 97]. The basic idea behind these approaches is to find the best way to obtain a communicative goal state by modifying the conversational record, which roughly corresponds to our listener model, with applicable operators. The plan is the set of hypotheses discovered by an abductive proof of the proposition that the goal state has been achieved.","What remains open in these approaches is to make precise the relation between the planned propositional content of an Utterance and an appropriate sentence form. only very simple example sentences 111"]},{"title":"!

If that were the case, one would call the abductive meta-interpreter with the goal instantiated deriving the assumed","• literals during interpretation, while forgeneration the opposite instantiation pattern would be used. BUt for the latter case this amounts to requiring that all literals must be assumed in the proof, which is clearly too strong since some of them might be derivable from the knowledge base. Instead we only specify which literals may be assumed, leaving open the possibility that some of them are provable from the knowledge base.","Also note that since we do not use weighted abduction, the problem of assigning different assumption costs for generation and interpretation (cf. [Thomason et al. 97]) is avoided. On the other hand, what should we use as a preference criterion? A sequence of several criteria is used. First, proofs are preferred for the number of provable literals used,the more the better. In the cases we consider, there, seems to be a loose correspondence between this criterion and the Gricean maxims of relevance and quality. Second, proofs are preferred compared to other proofs if they involve less assumptions. The number of assumptions made is determined by the cardinality of the set that is the reduction of the multiset foundduring an abductive proof. Third, everything, else being equal, we prefer proofs with the highest amount of assumption re-use. This is determined by the difference between the cardinalities of the multiset of assumptions and of its corresPonding set.
