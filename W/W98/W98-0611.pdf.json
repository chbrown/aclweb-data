We describe here practical tools that allow construction of an FST database which describes and then to retrieve nominal phrases composed with a sequence denoting an occupation and a proper noun, 1 Introduction To be able to retrieve information in a text, one must be able to describe in details the forms under which this information is expressed.

We are thus talking about linguistic \"information\". We have shown in (1998a), how descriptions of occupations and proper noun phrases could be processed by finite state transducer (FST). In a French daily newspaper, one sentence out of two contains such a noun phrase, thus, one cannot attempt to parse texts without recognizing such sequences. The recognition at this stage, should be accurate:"]},{"title":"minister of.finance and the minister, Mr Jones, for Scottish affairs are","paragraphs":["well-formed nominals, but"]},{"title":"minister for .finance","paragraphs":["is not. The syntactic and semantic description relies on the same basis: we must be able to fully enumerate such nominals.

Second, if we are able to handle without problem a dozen of rules, when their number increase (to several thousand), processes become rapidly difficult to check and to understand, because interactions between rules are not treated. We present here practical methods that allow to create dynamically, to maintain and to debug a large database of finite state transducers.

We could go on, but the size of the automaton becoming larger, it is more and more difficult to handle it on one screen.

Two main ideas should be kept in mind about clustering methodology: - homogeneous semantic sub-categories in an automaton should be put in a sub-automata, and - an automaton containing two semantic notions that we can separate, should be transformed into a more simple automaton containing only one semantic category. This clustering has many advantage:","82 with different level first, it allows a better readibility of automata, second, it factorizes homogeneous semantic units that we could use for other purposes. And third, it is very useful for processing, as we will show later. Now we have established the main structure: we must complete the different automata and dictionaries.

The final automaton may recognize sequences that are not stylistically or semantically perfect, but that are always well-formed, and their presence will not generate any noise. We skip a few stages to arrive to the proper noun description. Contrary to the French case, where the full name is always put in an external apposition of the occupation noun phrase, in English both can be mixed, we find in Our corpus for example: General Jean Cot of the French Army said the idea of... ... the French commander of troops there. General Jean Cot, Genera3 Jean Cot. the French Army GrAter who commands the And as Genenal John Shali&ajh~l~ has said, the Partnership... 83 We describe these four different structures (left and right apposition, proper nouns and occupations mixed, and only proper noun) in a simplified way 3 (to keep small automata for the presentation) by the automaton of figure 8.

The final number of recognized items is 863 (to compare with the 85 that we started ~om, and that were in majority used in another context (economic)). The number of the potential recognized sequences, as compared to the effectively recognized sequences is a guarantee that, on a totally new corpus, we will obtain instantly a good coverage and new potential SurName and FirstName (and this, with a rate proportional to the size of existing dictionaries). 5 Software The needed tools for such a methodology are:","1. Graph editor. The first tool (included in INTEX (1994)) is a graphic graph editor. This editor allows to create, copy and align parts of them. It handles input and output of transducers. It allows: by simple clicking, to open a sub-automaton.","2. Index-based parsing algorithm. A key feature of the text-based automaton construction, is in the possibility to have immediate concordances. It is hardly think-able parse sequentially a 10 million word corpus. Moreover, with many levels of automata (sometimes more than 20): the size of the developed main automaton becomes quickly huge, that we cannot re-compute for each concordance. Thus, we have chosen to index each sub-automaton independently, with a dependency graph (cf be-low) like makefile, we only re-compute, the modified graph, and those depending on it. The index parsing algorithm is described in (Senellart, 1998a). It allows us, to obtain concordances on the whole corpus, in a mean time less than ls on a average personal computer.","3. Concordance manager. We have shown during all along this paper: that the way the concordance are sorted has a great importance. Under INTEX, we can sort concordances according to the recognized sequence, to the right, or left context, and any combination of the three parameters. Moreover, when we put variables in the automaton, we must are able to validate recognized sequence linked to the variable in","84 Figure 9: Dependency graph of O~cer automaton a click.","4. Debugging tools. Maintaining a large number of automata is not simple: some automata depend on others of which, the exact name and the exact function must be recalled. Exactly as in compiling programs with a large number of source files, we can compute and represent (graphically) the dependencies between the different automaton. For example the graph of figure 9, represents the dependent sub-automaton used in the O~icer automaton, and the same for each of the sub-automaton. The depth in this graph is four. 6 Conclusion The simplicity with which we created the O.~- cer automaton is not based on new theoretical algorithms or formalism. It is totally based on useful tools elaborated at LADL. I have built for French a database of large coverage for proper nouns and occupations. This database includes more than 200 kinds of different main automata, proper noun dictionaries of towns, surnames, each with several thousand entries. This is a practical result, and I think that this is the case of almost all linguistic phenomena. We can describe them theoretically, but in practice the number of the different cases, and the links between them make impossible to list them without appropriate tools. The bootstrap method we present is a very general methodology, that make use of the text in an efficient way, to construct a local grammar.","References","J. Senellart. 1998a.
