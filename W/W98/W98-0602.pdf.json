The solution to be proposed is based on the assumption that non-stative verbs denote changes. Changes can be conceived of in two different ways, either as objects which bring about a particular result or as relations between states. A dynamic structure of events, intervals and states is defined in which both perspectives can be expressed by means of sorting the universe D. The basic idea is to augment a transition system for Dynamic Logic (DL) by a further domain of events such that programs from DL can be described either as objects or relations between states. The interpretation of verbs is based on the second perspective: they denote (generalized) relations between states. The interpretation of nominalized expressions uses the first perspective: they denote changes as objects.

The intuitive notion of a change comprises at least the following two aspects which are complementary to each other.","(i) something (an object) which brings about the change","(ii) something (a result) which is brought about by the change which did not hold before the change occurred -The notion of a change that is used in (i) and (ii), respectively, refers in each case to the other aspect. In (i) 'change' is understood as the result that is brought about, i.e., in the sense that is captured by (ii), whereas in (ii) 'change' is meant as the object that brings about the result.","The second aspect can be described as a transformation of state. Before the change occurred, the world was in a particular state, say s, in which some condition (property) d~ did not hold, 11 whereas after the change has occurred, the world is in a state s' in which ~ does hold. This perspective is captured in Dynamic Logic (DL). Some in-put-state s in which -~Â¢ holds is transformed into an output-state s' in which Â¢ holds. Program-letters ~ are interpreted as binary relations on the domain S of states: [r~] c S x S. The elements of [r~] (pairs of states) can be interpreted as particular executions of the program. Each program letter defines an accessibility relation such that DL is a polymodal logic. The fact that (s,s') ~ [~1 means that state s' can be reached (or is accessible) from state s by executing the program rc in s. It is therefore possible to view the program letter n as a label by which transitions between states can be decorated: s ---~(rc) s' holds just in case (s,s') [rc] and is to be read as 'by executing rc in state s state s' is reached'.","The disadvantage of the perspective which underlies DL is that changes are only derived objects, i.e. pairs of states or relations between states, that are defined in terms of the domain S of states. There is no separate domain E the elements of which are interpreted as bringing about the transformations of a state s to a state s' denoted by re. It is therefore not possible to interpret r~, when it is used to label a transition, as the object that brings about this transition because it is not interpreted as an independent object. What is not captured in DL, therefore, is the first perspective mentioned above in (i) according to which a change can be understood as an object which brings about a particular result. This perspective is captured, among others, in event-semantics (ES), Kfifka (1992), where events are interpreted as elements of a separate domain E. What is missing in ES is the second perspective of a change as a state-trans-former according to which events effect changes by bringing about some result ~.","The two perspectives can be combined in the following way. Each event e is of a particular type Pv where the index v corresponds to some (non-stative) verb from English, say eat or run. The elements of the event-type Pv are characterized by bringing about (or effecting) a change with respect to some property. For instance, events of type eat bring about changes with respect to the mass of an object. This object is denoted by the internal argument of eat, say an apple in eat an apple. The result ~ that holds with respect to this property upon termination of the event is that the mass is zero, i.e., the object has vanished. Events of type run, on the other hand, bring about a change with respect to the location of the object that is denoted by the external argument, e.g. John in John ran. The location of the object at the end of the event is different from its location at the beginning of the event (to be precise, the change need not always consist in a change of location. Events of type run around the park are possible counterexamples. Rather, the object traverses a non-empty path. Whereas the path is empty when the event is started, it is non-empty at its end).","Events of type eat differ from those of type run in the way the result d~ is brought about. This can be illustrated by means of the notion of a nucleus-structure (Moens/Steedman (1988)). A nucleus-structure consists of three parts: the incep-tion-point (IP), the development-portion (DP) and the culmination-point (CP). Nucleus-Structure","e S S' ........................................... [ IP DP CP Figure 1 The result Â¢ is evaluated at each part of the nucleus-structure. (Sequential) events of type eat and run agree on how ~ is evaluated at the IP and at the CP: it is false at the IP and true at the CP. They differ with respect to the DP. Whereas ~b is constantly false on the DP for events of type eat, it continuously holds for events of type run. From this it follows that for events of type eating ~ only holds at the CP and is therefore true at exactly one point of the nucleus-structure, whereas for events of type running ~ is false at only one point of the nucleus-structure, namely at the IP. The distinction between events of type eat and those of type run is therefore made in terms of how the result ~ is evaluated at intermediate states of an occurrence. Aspectually it is therefore not the mere input-output behaviour that is important but also what happens in between the beginning and the end of an occurrence.","From a procedural perspective the nucleus-structure can be interpreted as the execution-sequence ~ of some program n. The IP corresponds 12 to the input-state s, the CP to the output-state s' and the DP to the set of intermediate states s\" in between s and s': s < s\" < s' (where < is the ordering on G or some global ordering induced on the domain S). Thus, to each event e corresponds its execution-sequence G (= (s,s')) such that each event-type P, induces a binary relation R,, on S such that each element of R.v is the execution sequence of a (completed) event e e P~. The binary relation R~ is the result of applying a so-called dynamic mode to a property of states Q. The dynamic modes corresponding to an accomplishment-verb like eat and an activity-verb like run are given in (8a) and (8b), respectively."]},{"title":"(8)","paragraphs":["a. Con-BEC mode: ~,Q~.ss'[-~Q(s) A Q(s') A","Vs\"[s < s\" < s' -> Q(s\")]]","b. Min-BEC mode: ~Q~.ss'[~Q(s) A Q(s') ̂","Vs\"[s < s\" < s' -> -~Q(s\")]] In (8) Q is a property of states corresponding to the result that an event of type P~ is supposed to bring about. Not all events of type P~ will satisfy OPv(Q) (for OPt the dynamic mode assigned to P~) on their execution-sequence but only a certain subset, namely the completed sequential ones (for details see Naumann (1998) and section (2.1) below). The MIN-BEC-mode (partly) characterizes the class of accomplishments. This means that a verb-type v which belongs to this class is assigned this mode. Activity-verbs like push are assigned Con-BEC, the mode characterizing the class of activities. Other aspectual classes are characterized by different modes, Naumann (1997a,b), Naumann/Moil (1998). The dynamic mode assigned to an event-type P~ determines therefore the way in which a change effected by an event of this type is basically brought about. On this view events are a sort of 'reification' of particular executions of the program ~. In terms of ~ as a label of transitions this means that instead of s -o(r0 s' one now has s--o(e) s' such that e ~ P~ and (s,s') e R~ (= Ire]) where R~ is the binary relation induced by P,. In contrast to the DL-perspective the label e can be interpreted as the object that brings about the transition from s to s'. 13 DL-perspective I .........................

As the simplified definition does have no negative consequences for the analysis, it will be chosen for the sake of simplicity. The {Rv, } v' ~ VERB s are n+2-ary relations on D\" x S x S (for variable n) which are used to interpret stative verbs.

A change can be viewed either as an object or as a transformation of state. The first perspective is related to the eventuality structure E whereas the second perspective is linked to the dynamic transition structure S. These two complementary perspectives will be used for the interpretation of verbs and derived/ingofnominals. In principle, each of the two perspectives can be used for the interpretation of both verbs and defived/ingofnominals. In ES the first perspective is chosen for the interpretation of verbs. An n-place verb v is interpreted as the n+lplace relation (9). (9) ~.x I ... XxnXe[P,(e ) 0̂1(e,xl) ̂... ̂0n(e,x,) ] In contrast to ES, the translation of verbs in the present approach will be based on the second perspective of a change. This decision is based on two reasons. First, 'ordinary', i.e. non-derived nouns, like man for instance, are usually analyzed as denoting sets of objects of the basic domain D. Using type-theory, this means that they are translated as expressions of type <e,t> (where D, = D). From this it follows that derived and ingofnominals should be interpreted as denoting sets of basic entities too. In the present framework there are five basic domains: O,E,I,T and S. It is therefore possible to distinguish between five different (nonlogical) sorts of basic expressions because each domain can be taken to be the domain for expressions of a corresponding sort 13 where 8 is either o, E, i, tp or s, i.e. the sort of objects, events, intervals, time-points or states. Above D was defined as the union of the basic domains. The sorting of the universe D can be used at the level of types of expressions by letting each expression of type <B,t> for g e {o,e,i,s,tp} be also of type <e,t>. It is then possible to translate nouns uniformly as expressions of type <e,t>, i.e. as denoting sets of elements from D, which can be further subclassifled according to the sorts o, e, i, tp and s. For in-stance, the translation of man will be an expression of type <o,t>, denoting sets of 'ordinary' objects (that is, elements from O). Derived nouns like performance of the song by the soprano and ingof nominals like performing of the song by the soprano are translated as expression s of type <e,t> which denote sets of events. The second reason has to do with the distinction between the translations of verbal and nominal expressions. On the present account, an n-place verb will be translated as an expression of type <(z~..., <ctn,<s,<s,t>>>...>, where the ct i, l_<i_<n, are the types of the (translations of the) subcategodzed ('ordinary') arguments. From this it follows that the translations of sentence radicals like John run or Mary eat an apple are of type <s,<s,t>>. They denote binary relations on S and, consequently, no sets of basic objects. This is in contrast to nominal expressions the translations of which are of type <ctn,<13,t>> for (x n a (possibly empty) sequence of types and 8 a basic type. After the first n arguments have been discharged, nominal expression like man or performing of the song by the soprano therefore denote sets of elements of some basic domain D B. Thus, verbal expressions are semantically distinguished from nominal ones. Whereas (the dynamic components of) the latter denote sets of entities, the (dynamic components of) former denote binary relations on S. The main task consists in showing how the nonrelational perspective can be derived from the relational perspective that is used for the interpretation of verbs in the lexicon.","Each event e of type P, for some v is related to an n+2 tuple <x 1 ..... xn,s,s'> of objects (individuals): 'v'e ~ Pv3xl...xn3ss'[(e,xl) ~ 01 ̂... (e,xn) 0 n A x*(e) = (s,s')] by means of the functions ix*, 13\", ~: and ~*. The pair (s,s') is the execution-sequence of e. The xi are the values for e of the thematic relations for which the event-type Pv is defined according to ~:. From this it follows that each Pv induces an n+2-ary relation Rv defined in (lo). 15 (10) a. b. Rv(X~)...(x~)(s)(s') = 1 iff there is an e Pv such that (i) ~Â¢*(P,)(e) = <x~ ..... x~> (ii) ct*(e) = s (iii) B*(e) = s' Rv = {<x~,...x,,s,s'> ~ D n x S x S I 3e[e","Pv A (e,xi) ~ 0 i A x*(e) = (s,s')]} The condition (i) requires that the value for e of each e-role for which Pv is defined is an argument of the relation and that the i-th argument of R is the value of e for the i-th e-role assigned to Pv. The second requirement implies that (e,x~) ~ 0 i. In (10b) and the definitions that follow condition (i) will therefore be reduced to (e,x~) ~ 0 i.","Let {Rv} v ~ VERB~ be the set of (induced) binary relations corresponding to (10). Rv will be used in the interpretation of the verb v in the lexicon although this relation itself cannot be taken as the denotation of the verb. Rather, v denotes a subset of Rv, namely that subset such that (s,s') OP(Q) with OP = ~P~) and Q = 8(P0. Recall that on the present account each transformation of states is supposed to be brought about by some event e of a particular type Pv. For a particular v, the change is brought about in some specific way determined by the dynamic mode ~Pv) with respect to the property Q (= 8(Pv)). For instance, events of type eating bring about a change with respect to the mass of an object that is denoted by the internal argument and the property Q is that the mass be zero. An attempt to bring about Q by eating can fail. For instance, if only half of the object is eaten, Q does not hold in the final state of the execution. At the program-level the execution is a non-completed one which is a proper prefix of a completed one, where a completed execution is an execution (s,s') such that (s,s') ~ ~P,)(8(P~)). If Â• ~P) = Min-BEC, no proper prefix of an execution-sequence that is an element of the program is itself an element of the program. Yet these non-completed execution-sequences too are transforma-tions of states that are brought about by an event e' of type eating but they are not denoted by eat because 8(Pv) does not hold in their final states.","Events e of type Pv the execution-sequences of which satisfy ~Pv)(8(P,)) are denoted by expressions where the arguments are non-mass and singular like John eat the apple or The student push the cart to the station. From a programming perspective, these transitions correspond to (executions of) a sequential program. If the arguments are plural as in eat three apples or eat apples, the program must be executed for each apple separately such that one gets a parallel program that consists of three (or n) sequential subprograms each of which is of type ~P,)(8(Pv)). The execution sequence of the parallel program need not satisfy ~P0(8(Pv)) which is exactly what is required witness the well-known aspectual contrast between eat three apples and eat apples. As shown in Naumann (1997a, 1998), given 8 and y, it is possible to calculate the dynamic mode for the result Q' (which is a function of the results for the sequential subprograms).

Similarly to R,, it is determined by ~Â¢, ~Â¢*, ~* and, additionally, by 8 and y. According to (11), a non-stative verb in the lexicon denotes a (generalized) relation between states, i.e., it is an expression of sort <ct,<s,<s,t>>> where Â¢x is a (non-empty) sequence of basic sorts, as required at the beginning of this section.

The analysis of gerundive nominals is based on a third perspective. Whenever an event e of some type P occurs, a corresponding sequence 6 is (partially) realized on the run-time \"t(e) of e, namely that sequence t~ such that x(e) = i and p*(i) = (s,s') (i.e. x*(e) = (s,s')). The occurrence of e therefore partly determines the world when it occurs by bringing about ~(P) in the way corresponding to 7(P). Thus, each event e can be said to leave some trace behind. This trace concerns the property that is changed by the event, e.g. the location of some object. The trace of an event can be defined as a pair <i, OP(Q)> and thus as a property of intervals. Properties of intervals can be taken to be states of affairs (SOAs), i.e., partial constellations the world is in during some period. SOAs as properties of intervals are a third perspective in which a change can be described. It will be argued that gerundive nominals denote SOAs. 17","First, intervals are objects which are neither slow or sudden nor can they be said to take a long time. Second, on the existential reading it is the occurrence of an event which is surprising. But whenever an event has occurred, a corresponding SOA has been realized.

What is surprising about e's run-time interval is the fact that OP(Q) is realized on it.

Fourth, as the domain D is structured such that E,I, and O are subsets of D and gerundive nominals are of sort <i,t>, each expression of this sort is also of sort <e,t>.

Fifth, not only traces of events are states of affairs but any property of intervals for some OP, including HOLD, such that there are no aspectual restrictions on gerundive nominals. Therefore, the notion of a SOA not only comprises changes as intervals on which a change of some property Q occurred but also intervals on which Q continuously holds (as a result of some change brought about by an event e). The state of affairs that OP(Q) has been realized is defined in (17). (17) SOAop(Q ) = {ieII [p*(i) e OF(Q)]} SOAop(Q ) is that property which an interval i has just in case OP(Q) is realized on it in the sense that the corresponding sequence p*(i) satisfies this property.

First, the set of those intervals which are the run-time of an event e which brings about OP(Q): SOA~.op(Q ), (18a). The events corresponding to SOA~.op(Q ) need not all belong to the same type P, because OP(Q) can be brought about by events of different types.

(i) Non-stative verbs denote changes (ii) The notion of change comprises different","aspects From (i) it follows that any theory must admit to model the intuitive notion of change. This seems to require some form of Dynamic Logic or some other form of programming logic in which the development of something going on in time can be represented. The second assumption seems to require the use of a (many-) sorted model such that the domains corresponding to the different sorts are systematically related to each other. Each domain must be equipped with some structure. The different aspects that the notion of change comprises are then linked to the different domains and their corresponding structures. Thus, besides sorting the universe, there must be enough structure in order that the different aspects can be modeled in an adequate way. This makes it necessary to use some form of a decompositional analysis of verbs. In the present approach the decomposition is done first with respect to the argument structure: n-place verbs are analyzed as denoting n+2-ary relations, and second with respect to the semantic content of a verb. This content is split into a dynamic and a static component. The dynamic component denotes some type of transition between states which is brought about by an event. This component is therefore closely related to the first decompositional component. The static component concems the relationship between the arguments that are introduced by the decompositional analysis and the 'ordinary', subcategorized arguments. This relationship is expressed by thematic relations."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Krifka, M. (1992) Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Thematic Relations, in: Sag, I. et al.
