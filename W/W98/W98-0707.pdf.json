Despite WordNet's large coverage, which comprises some 100,000 concepts lexicMi~.ed by approySmately 120,000 word forms (strings) and is comparable to that of a collegiate dictionary, it contains relatively little figurative language. WordNet includes a w~mber of multi-word strings, such as phrasal verbs, but many idiomatic verb phrases Like smell a rat, know the ropes, and eat humble pie, are mi~ging. Idioms and metaphors abound in everyday language and are found in texts spanning many genres (see, e.g., (Jackendoff, 1997) for a numerical estlm~te of the frequency of idioms and fixed expression). Clearly, a dictionary that in-dudes extended senses of words and phrases is likely to yield more successful NLP applications. On the one hand, no system wants to retrieve the string bucket from the idiom kick the bucket. On the other hand, MT and WSD efforts need to distinguish the sense of ropes in phrases like know~learn/teach someone the ropes from the sense meaning \"strong cords\"; selecting the latter sense in any of the idiomatic phrases leads to failure. An IR query is likely to be interested only in the \"strong cord\" reading. When this sense is to be retrieved with the aid of a lexicon intended for multiple applications, the figurative sense must be successfully recognized and excluded from a text that may contain instances of the string ropes with both meanings.","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending WordNet to accommodate figurative meanings in the English lexicon. While much 52 h~.~ been written on figurative language, there is no agreement on the boundary between literal and non-literal language, see e.g. (Moon, 1986). Criteria that are commonly accepted include semantic non-compositionality and syntactic constraints on internal modification (such as adjective and adverb insertion) and movement transformations. Our purpose here is not to attempt a clear delimitation or definition of non-literal language, but to examine how extended senses of words and phrases from different syntactic and lexical categories-or conforming to none of the standard categories-are compatible with the network structure of a relational lexicon like WordNet and its particular way of represent-ing words and concepts. Our discussion will focus on, but not be limited to, idiomatic verb phrases. 2 A simple Classification An inspection of idiom dictionary sources such as (Boatner et al., 1975) suggests a three-fold distinction among idioms for our purposes. 3 Constructions First, some idiomatic constructions are simply too complex to be integrated into WordNet and must be excluded at this point. We have in mind constructions of the kind studied by (Fillmore et al., 1988) and (Jackendoff, 1997),(Jackendoff, 1997). Examples are the more the merrier and she can't write a letter, let alone a novel These structures comprise discontinuous constituents and morpheme chunks that are governed by special syntactic and semantic rules. Thus, the X-er the Y-er allows the insertion of a wide variety of adjectives. Fillmore et al. discuss let alone and show that its syntactic properties require an amazing amount of description of facts absent from the standard"]},{"title":"I i I I I I I i t I I I I I I i I I I","paragraphs":["grammar. A full account of these constructions goes far beyond the lexical level, and therefore we need to exclude them, at least for now, in a database like WordNet that does not in-dude much syntax and whose relational semantics cannot accommoda~ the kind of semantic facts observed by Fillmore et al. and Jackendoff. 4 Idioms as a kind of polysemy By contrast, the second kind of idiomatic structure is unprobl~matic for WordNet. WordNet contains not only simple verbs and no-na but also more complex verb and noun phrases like show the way and academic gown. Strings like stepping stone, kick the bucket, hit the bottle, and come out of the closet therefore correspond to categories already represented in the database, and can be included when they are considered as partie, lar manifestations of polysemy. Polysemy in WordNet is represented by membership of the polysemous string in different synonym sets; synonym sets (synsets) in WordiNet represent concepts that are lexicalized by one or more strings (synonyms). In other words, the synsets contain different words forms with the same meaning, and a word form with more than one meaning appea~ in as many different synsets as it has meanings.","For example, the string fish occurs as a verb in two different synsets, and has thus two distinct senses in WordNet. One expresses the concept \"catch, or try to catch, seafood;\" the other sense is ~seek indirectly,\" as in the phrases fish for compliments and fish for information. Note that such a representation does not in fact attempt to answer the question as to whether or not the second sense of fish is indeed an \"extended\" one or not, but simply treats them as different meanlngs of the same word form.","Figurative senses can be seen as homophones rather than polysemes in that there is no discernible relation between the \"literal\" and the \"extended\" senses. WordNet does not formally distinguish between polysemy and homophony but treats these two phenomena of multiple meanings alike under the label of polysemy.","In all cases of polysemy, membership in two different synsets entails a different location in the semantic network and relatedness to distinct concepts for each sense. Thus, the first sense of 53 fish is a subordinate of catch and is further related to more semantically specified senses (troponyms) including flyfish, net fish, trawl, and shrimp. The second, arguably extended, sense h~_q as its superordinate concept the synset containing the strings search and look .for. The different locations in the network of the two senses offish, together with the difference in the kinds of noun objects they select are the sort of information exploited in NLP applications, and they will suffice in most cases to distinguish the two senses in such cases where the senses are homophones rather than polysemes.","Some phrases consisting of more than one word can be treated in a similar manner. For example, the idiomatic verb phrases kick the bucket, chew the fat, and take a powder can be considered as single units. Their constituents never occur in an order different from the cited one because these idioms are syntactically completely frozen. They not tolerate the insertion of an adjective or adverb, nor do they undergo passivization, clefting, or any movement trans-formation that would change the order of the individual strings.1","The system therefore needs only to recognize the string that is part of the lexicon. If the strings kick, bucket, powder, fat, etc., occur outside of the idiom order, they do not receive the idiomatic interpretation and must be considered as carrying different meanings.","Some compound nouns have extended senses as well, such as stepping stone, straight arrow, and square shooter. We classify these as instances of non-literal language, because the head (the rightmost noun) is not the superordinate concept for the figurative reading: a stepping stone is not a kind of stone; a straight arrow is not a type of arrow, and a square shooter is not a specific shooter. By contrast, nouns like limestone, gravestone, and gemstone, and sharpshooter and trapshooter are linked to their superordinates senses, one or more senses of stone and shooter, respectively; similarly, a broad arrow is a subordinate of arrow. Many NLP applications using WordNet for determin-","lOaly the verb changes in that it shows the usual in-flectional endings; this should not pose a major problem for English idioms where the verb is virtually always the first constituent in a Verb Phrase (VP) idiom and can thus be easily recognized."]},{"title":"I I i 1 I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["ing discourse coherence, finding malpropisms (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), and word sense disambiguation (Voorhees, 1998); (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) identify related word senses by means of links such as between super- and subordinates. When searching a text, such systems could easily recognize (and discard as potentlaUy related senses) figurative compounds such as stepping stone and straight shooter because these are not linked to nouns correspondtug to their heads. 2","Moreover, literal and figurative senses are often in very different WorclNet files: an arrow (and its hyponyms broad arrow and butt shaft) are classified as noun.artifacts; while a straight arrow is found in the noun.person file.","Frozen VP idioms and metaphoric noun compounds can be integrated into the WordNet database and distinguished from literally referring expressions in many cases. But much of what is commonly considered to be figurative language presents more serious problems for a semantic network like WordNet and applications relying on its particular design. The remainder of this paper will be devoted to a discussion of the third category of idioms, which includes verb phrases like learn the ropes and hide one's light under a bushel. These cannot automatically be integrated into WordNet, but we offer some proposals for adding them to the lexicon.","5 Some challenging idioms for WordNet The integration into WordNet of many idioms that do not fall into one of the categories discussed above is problematic for a variety of reasons. 6 Formal problems First, there are formal problems. Some idiom strings have surface forms that do not conform to any of the syntactic categories included in WordNet. For example, many idioms must occur with a negation: the VP give a hoot loses its (figurative) meaning in the absence of negation; the same is true for the VP hold a candle","2In this respect, idiomatic compounds resemble exoeestric compounds like lot~-life and sea~ata, which are not kinds of lives or latum, either, nor ate they found in the vicinity of these concepts in the semantic net. 54 to. The negation must therefore be considered part of the idioms. But a verb phrase headed by negation is not a constituent recognized in WordNet.","Consider also the string eat one's cake and have it, too: here, two verb phrases are adjoined and are often followed by an adverb. Moreover, the second clause contains a pronoun coreferent with the noun in the first clause. Again, such a string does not fit in with WordNet's entries. Some idioms are entire sentences. Wild horses could not make me do that and the cat's got your tongue are not compatible with any of WordNet's noun, verb, adjective, or adverb component. WordNet does not contain sentences, and at present we see no way of integrating these into the lexical database. The problem should be addressed in the future, because an NLP system would simply attempt to treat each constituent in these idioms separately, with undesirable consequences.","In some cases, idioms whose syntactic shape does not correspond to any of the categories in WordNet could be accommodated nevertheless when they are synonymous with strings that are represented in an existing synset. For example, the negation-headed phrase not in a pig's eye and the clauses when hell freezes over and when the cows come home are all synonymous with never, which is included among Word.Net's ad-verbs. If such strings are completely frozen, as they tend to be, they can be included as synonymous members of existing WordNet synsets and the fact that they do not conform to any of WordNet's syntactic categories can be ignored. Such idioms do not pose problems for automatic processing because they do not admit of any phrase-internal variation or modification.","Another formal (syntactic) problem pertains to the fact that the fixed parts of many VP idioms are not continuous. For example, a number of expressions contain nouns that resemble inalienable possessions, such as body parts, and a possessive adjective that is bound to the subject. Examples are hold one's light under a bushel, blow one's stack, and flip one's wig. In other idioms with a similar structure, the possessive is not bound to the subject but refers to another noun (got someone's number). And expressions like cook one's goose allow for both bound and unbound genitives."]},{"title":"I I I ! I i I I I I | I I ! i I I","paragraphs":["These idioms cannot be treated as single strings because the genitive slot can be filled by any of the possessive adjectives, or by a noun in the case of the unbound genitive. One solution would be to enter these strings into the lexicon with a placeholder, such as a metacharacter, in place of the genitive. This would make for a somewhat unfelicitous entry. But a rule could be added to a preprocessor for a syntactic tagger that allowed the placeholder be substituted with either a pronoun from a finite list (for the bound cases) or any noun from WordNet (for the unbound cases); the preprocessor would then be able to recognize the idiom as a unit and match the WordNet entry and the actual string. Currently, we do not have a preprocessor that is able to recognize discontinuous constituents, but given the large number of VP idioms and their frequency in the language, the development of such a tool seems desirable. 3 7 What kinds of concepts axe these? In the previous section, we considered idioms whose syntactic form does not comply with any of the categories N(P), V(P), Adj(P), or Adverbial(P) represented in Word.Net or whose syntax poses problems for the creation of a neat dictionary entry. However, such idioms could easily be added to the lexical database when they are synonymous with strings that fit into WordNet's design and organization. But many such syntactically idiosyncratic idiom strings raise a second problem having to do with their conceptual-semantic rather than their syntactic nature. They express concepts that cannot be fitted into WordNet's web structure either as members of existing synsets or as independent concepts, because there are no other lexicalized concepts to which they can be linked via any of the WordNet relations. In fact, if one examines idioms and their glosses in an idiom dictionary, one quickly realizes that almost all idioms express complex concepts that cannot be paraphrased by means of any of the standard lexical or syntactic categories. Consider such examplea as fish or cut bait, cook one's/somebody's 9oose, and drown one's sorrows/troubles. These","~A related phenomenon is that of phrasal verbs, many of which allow particle movemeat. In the cases where the verb head and the particle are not contiguous, they e~nnot currently be adjoint by the preprocessor and they are therefore not matched to an entry in Word.Net. 55 idioms carry a lot of highly specific semantic information that would probably get lost if they were integrated into WordNet and attached to more general concepts.","The problems for WordNet posed by syntactically or semantically idiosyncratic idioms would be reduced if these could be broken up, that is, if the individual content words in the idioms could be treated as referring expressions and be assigned meanings that are similar to concepts already represented in the lexicon. Some traditional dictionaries decompose a number of such idioms and attempt to give an interpretations to their individual parts. This may seem justifiable particularly in cases where the idioms are syntactically variable, indicating that speakers assign meanings to some of their components. For example, the American Heritage dictionary defines one sense of the noun ice as \"extreme unfriendliness or reserve.\" This entry seems motivated by the apparent semantic transparency of the noun (in contrast to strings like bucket in Idck the bucket, which seems to have no referent at all, let alone a transparent one). But synsets of the kind ice, extreme unfriendliness or reserve seem undesirable for a computationally viable dictionary like WordNet, because ice cannot be used freely and compositionally with the proposed meanings. This is evident in sentences like the following: (a) I felt/resented his unfriendliness/reserve/*ice. (b) His unfriendliness/reserve/*ice melted away. (c) Our laughter broke the .unfriendliness/reserve/","ice.","A language generation system (or a learner of English) relying on WordNet's lexicon could not be blocked from producing the ungrammatical sentences above, if they are exploiting on the close similarity and usage of the members of the synset. Moreover, automatic attempts at word sense disambiguation that rely on syntactic taggers could probably not identify the correct sense of ice in this phrase, because they could not recognize that the noun is a part of an idiom if the dictionary entry contains this noun in isolation, outside of its idiomatic context. Only when one entry for ice lists the specific environment (break and the definite determiner) can a program recognize the idiom and assign the proper meaning."]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["Consider a second example. The American Heritage Dictionary contains an sense of ropes that is glossed as \"specialized procedures or details.\" This sense of ropes is the one in the expressions know/learn/get/teach the ropes. To assume a compositional reading here seems more justified than in the case of ice, because this idiom is more flexible than break the ice and can undergo some internal modification as well as passivization (he never learnt the ropes~he taught Fred the ropes/Pfed was taught the ropes). Moreover, ropes co-occurs with more verbs than just one. In fact, the verbs for which it can serve as an argument are compatible with the meaning assigned to ropes by the American Heritage Dictionary. A word sense disambiguation system that relied on the semantics of the contexts of the ambiguous word (such as","• the verbs a noun co-occurs with), would probably choose the correct sense of rope, because the contexts of \"specialized procedures n or \"details ~ do not seem to overlap with the contexts in which ropes is found with the sense of \"strong cords.\"","Yet despite their shared verb contexts, the distribution of ropes is far more narrow than that of specialized procedures or details. Again, a language generation system or a learner of English might overgenerate and produce incomprehensible sentences like I forgot the ropes or Tell me the ropes. Therefore, an optimal solution might be to enter the idiom as a string but with a placeholder instead of the verb; a separate rule in the lexicon would list the verbs that are compatible with the idiomatic reading of the string.","The proposed solution for the idioms Like teach/%arn/get the ropes and those that contain a possessive genitive might suggest a huge amount of work. However, a survey of English idioms suggests that most are frozen and could therefore simply be entered as entire strings, without the need for specifying a list of selected verbs.","Another type of VP idiom that does not readily fit into WordNet is that whose meaning can be glossed as be or become Adj. These idioms have the form of a VP but express states: hide one's light under a bushel and hold one's tongue mean \"be modest\" and \"be quiet, ~ respectively; flip one's wig;, blow one's stack/a fuse, and hit the roof/ceiling all mean \"become angry,\" and 56","get the axe means be fired/dismissed. Simi-","laxly, the phrase one's heart goes out (to) can","be glossed by means of the verb .feel and the","adjective phrase \"sorry or sympathetic (for).\"","Such idioms pose a problem for integration into","WordNet, not because of their form but because","of the kinds of concepts they express. In Word-","Net, verbs (including eopular verbs) and adjec-","tives are strictly separated because they express","distinct kinds of concepts. This separation is of","course desirable and even necessary when one","deals with non-idiomatic language, where the","meaning of a phrase or sentence is composed of","the meanings of its individual parts. Copular or","copula-like verbs like be and .feel combine with a","large number of adjectives and there is no point","in entering specific combinations into a lexicon. 4 While the separation of verbs and the adjec-","tives they select accounts for the large num-","ber of possible combinations allowed in the lan-","guage, it also means that there exist no concepts","like \"feel sorry/sympathetic (for)\" or \"become","angry\" in WordNet, and idioms like one's heart","goes out (to} and hit the roof are presently ex-","cluded from the lexicon. Yet these strings need","to be added if the lexicon is to serve NLP appli-","cations of real texts, where idiomatic language is","pervasise.

Some idioms pose formal, syntactic problems and express complex concepts that are not expressible by mean.q of the standard lexical and syntactic categories, including those represented in WordNet. Other idioms are formally uaremarkable but express concepts","4There are some de-adjectival verbs that express specillc concepts with meanings \"be or become Adjective,\" such as pa/e or redden. Idioms that express the same concepts as such verbs could be added as synonyms, but these cases are very few."]},{"title":"!

Perhaps one function of idioms (and one reason for their frequency and their persistence over time) is to provide for the pre-coded lexicalized expression of complex concepts and ideas that do not exist as units in the language and would have to be composed by speakers. Their frequent occurrence in the language seems to show that many idioms refer to salient concepts and must be considered an important part of the lexicon. We have made some proposals for their integration into WordNet that should benefit in particular the kinds of NLP applications that rely on this lexical resource.
