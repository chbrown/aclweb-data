The set of words from these grammatically heterogeneous classes that can signal coherence relations we call discourse markers. For example, :the CONCESSION relation in English can be signalled with the subordinator although, the adverb Still, the preposition despite, and a number of other words.","For most coherence relations, language offers quite a variety of such markers, as several studies Of individual relations have demonstrated (see references in Section 2). Accordingly, from the generation perspective, a serious choice task arises if the produced • text is not only to simply signal :the coherence relation, but moreover to reflect pragmatic goals, stylistic considerations, and the different connotations markers have. The importance of these factors was stressed by Scott and de Souza [1990], who gave a number of informal heuristics for when and how to signal the presence of coherence relations in text. Fleshing out the choice task in order to come up with a computational model, though, reveals two sources of difficulty.","For one thing, in addition to syntactic variety, the precise semantic and pragmatic differences between similar markers can be quite difficult to determine. For instance, the CONCESSION markers although and even though differ merely in emphasis; the CAUSE markers because and since differ in whether they mark the following information as given or not; the German CAUSE markers weil and denn differ in the illocution type of the conjuncts (proposition versus statement).

However , these are all isolated studies, geared towards a particular application. There is at present no overall framework that supports informed and motivated marker generation for more than a small set of markers and relations. The broadest overview on discourse markers to our knowledge is the descriptive work of Knott and Mellish [1996], but it does not specifically address the NLG perspective. Moser and Moore [1995] and DiEugenio et al. [1997] also take a broader view on marker production in that they try to determine general factors that influence the use of markers in text, and in that they consider more than pairs of propositions.• However, they are largely • concerned with marker occurrence and placement, not with marker selection."]},{"title":"3 Sentence planning","paragraphs":["The traditional §plit of NLG systems in a content determination/what-to-say component and a realization/how-to-say component was in recent years •supplemented by an intermediate stage: sentence planning, sometimes called"]},{"title":"micro-planning","paragraphs":["(e.g., Rambow and Korelsky [1992]). The primary motivation for this step is to relieve the text planner from language-specific knowledge, • and to relieve the realization component from any planning or decision-making that potentially • 129. affects the mean.ing of the utterance. Hence, better control of the overall generation process is gained. We do not elaborate the advantages further here; see, for example, [Panaget 1994].","What are the specific decisions to be made by the sentence planner? We think it is important to separate the format{re decisions from the motivations that lead to the particular choices. Following Wanner and Hovy [1996], a sentence planner has tomake the following decisions: Fine-grained discourse structuring, including discourse marker choice; sentence grouping and sentence content determination; clause-internal structuring; Choice of referring expressions; lexical choice} Two groups of considerations are important for these tasks: First, the motivating factors such as stylistic choices, semantic relations, intentions, theme development, focusing, discourse history. Second, the interactions with other desicions, because different formative decision may realize the same motivation. In contrast to present NLG systems, which realize the production of marker choices as a mere consequence of other sentence level decisions, we think that sentence planning interactions ough t to be respected for discourse markers, too, as the following examples illustrate:","• Ordering of related clauses (cause-effect vs. effect-cause) \" . Because he was unhappy, he asked to be transferred, vs. He asked to be transferred, for he was unhappy, vs. • For he was unhappy, he asked to be transferred.","• Aggregation He has quarrelled with the chairman. He resigned from his post. vs. He has quarrelled with the chairman and resigned from his post.","• Delimit individual sentences They fought a battle. Afterwards, it snowed, vs. After they fought a battle, it snowed.","• • Clause-internal structuring (hypotaxis vs. parataxis) Although he has tried hard, he failed, vs. He tried hard, but he failed.","• Lexical choice (to know vs. ignorance) She died, because she didn't know the rules, vs. She died through ignorance of the rules.","• Realizing negation He will not attend unless he finishes his paper, vs. He will attend if he finishes his paper. Due to these interdependencies, any fixed order of making decisions in sentence planning wiil impose limitations on the expressiveness of the system. Accordingly, we advocate a flexible order of decisiommaking, as it can be realized in a blackboard-based architecture such as proposed by DIOGENES [Nirenburg et al. 1989] and HealthDoc [Wanner and Hovy 1996]. Moreover, the individual modules or knowledge sources should rely on declarative representations as much as possible; otherwise the control process becomes extremely complicated. And one of the declarative sources of information, we feel, should be a lexicon that assembles •specifically the information associated with discourse markers."]},{"title":"4 ••The Discourse marker lexicon","paragraphs":["4.1 Discourse markers as lexical entities The traditional clistinction between content words and function words (or open-Class and closed-class items) relies on the stipulation that the former have their \"own\" meaning independent of the","1How exactly these tasks axe to be accomplished depends on the nature of the input and output representations, and thus on the architecture of the generator.

Then, content words are assigned to the realm of the lexicon, whereas function words are treated as a part of grammar. For dealing with discourse markers, we do not regard this distinction as particularly helpful, though. These words can carry a wide variety of semantic and pragmatic overtones, which render the task of selecting a marker meaning-driven, as opposed to a mere consequence of structural decisions.","Furthermore, notice that a number of lexical relations customarily used to assign structure to the universe of \"open Class\" lexical items can be applied to discourse markers as well. For instance, the German words obzwar and obschon (both more formal variants of obwohl = although) are at least very close to being synonyms. As for plesionyms (near-synonyms), although and though, according to Martin [1992], differ in formality, and although and even though differ in terms of emphasis. If and unless can be seen as antonyms, as they both express conditionality, but with opposite polarity. Some markers are more specific than others, thus display hyponymy. E.g., but can signal a general CONTRAST or a more specific CONCESSION. Finally, other than being more or less specific, some markers can signal quite different relations; e.g., while can be used for TEMPORAL CO-OCCURRENCE, and also for CONTRAST. Hence, the marker is polysemous.","For these reasons, discourse markers should be described by a dedicated lexicon that provides a classification of their syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features and characterizes the relationships between similar markers. This will be a lexicon whose main grouping criterion is function rather than grammatical category; not surprisingly, this is motivated by the production perspective, where the parameters governing the generation decisions play the central role. 4.2 Methodology Methodological considerations pertain to the two tasks of determining the set of words we regard as discourse markers, and determining the lexical entries for these words.","Finding the \"right\" set of discourse markers is not an easy task, since the common lexicographic practice of having syntactic behaviour as the criterion for inclusion does not apply. Knott and Mellish [1996] provide an apt summary of the situation. Their 'test for relational phrases' is a good start, but geared towards the English language (we are investigating German as well), and furthermore it catches only items relating clauses; in Despite the heavy rain, we went for a walk it would not detect a cue phrase. To identify more markers, we worked with traditional dictionaries and with grammars like Quirk et al. [1972] and Helbig and Buscha [1991]. The resulting set of markers is further validated by investigating coherence relations and their possible realizations; here, we can draw on our earlier work [RSsner and Stede 1992, Grote et al. 1997].","As for the shape of the lexical entries, there are two tasks: First, determining the distinguishing features and classifying markers according to these features, and second, finding appropriate computational representations. At present, we axe mostly concerned with the first step, but in section 5, we make an initial proposal for representations.","Regarding the set of features, our goal can be characterized as finding a synthesis of two different perspectives on marker description, between which there has been little overlap in the research literature: Text linguistics considers markers as a means to signal coherence, and provides us with insights on the semantic and pragmatic properties of marker Classes, hence approaches the matter \"top-down\". On the other hand, grammars and style guides provide syntactic, semantic and stylistic properties of individual markers, thus look \"bottom-up\".","Specifying the distinctions within sets of similar markers can be quite subtle. In addition to drawing on our earlier work cited above, we employ techniques such as paraphrasing, Knott's substitution test [Knott and Mellish 1996], analysis of typical distributions using corpora, and contrastive studies. Extracting features in this way seems justified since at this stage we arc unlike 131 feature unless for however even though notwithstanding syntactic part-of-speech connection type scope of marker position linear ordering semantic semantic relation polarity functional order nuclearity pragmatic formality emphasis discourse relation subordinator hypotaxis S simple front N S condition act negated any N: act standard none PRECONDITION subordinator hypotaxis any front NS cause any effect-cause N: effect standard none VOL.CAUSE adverb intersent. any front/mid/end SN concession any conceding-conceded N- conceded standard none CONCESSION subordinator hypotaxis S simple front any concession any any N: conceded standard intensified CONCESSION preposition intraclausal N and S simple front any concession any any N: conceded formal none CONCESSION Table 1: Sample lexicon entries for some English markers DiEugenio et al. [1997J--not concerned with the predictive power of individual features but rather with decomposing markers into features that are relevant for integrating marker choice into sentence planning. 4.3 The shape of the lexicon The initial set of features we have thus obtained can be grouped in the traditional categories:","Syntactic features are the part-of:speech of a marker and the type of connection it establishes (prepositions link constituents within a clause; conjunctions build a paratactic or hypotactic structure, but some can also function as intersentential linkers). The scope of a marker is the complexity of the segments it can combine (complex subtree or simple propositions). The linear ordering of the conjuncts can differ from marker to marker (e.g., with the connective for, the subordinate clause is always postponed ) as well as the marker's position within the segment (e.g., prepositions always occur at the beginning of a segment; adverbs like however can occur in front-, mid- and end-position).","Semantic features are foremost the semantic relation established (e.g. causal or temporal link). Some markers show a particular behaviour towards negation, which is related to polarity (e.g., ffversus unless). Further, we observe that Certain markers impose what we term a functional ordering, for instance, for requires the order effect-cause.","Pragmatic features include the discourse relation expressed by the marker and the type of illocutionary acts it conjoins (e:g., German well links propositions, denn links judgements). Some markers differ in terms of presuppositions and the assignment of given/new (e.g., because versus since). Stylistic features represent dimensions like formality and emphasis.","To illustrate how these features discriminate between markers, table 1 gives five preliminary sample entries. N is a shorthand for nucleus in the RST sense, S for satellite. Notice that table 1 is merely an illustration, and not all the features introduced above are actually required for classification. Issues of lexical representation, including dealing with polysemy and homonymy in some inheritance-based formalism, will be addressed in a later stage of the project. 132"]},{"title":"~N'D.","paragraphs":["I~~ II01 II11. i141 1151 131 141 171 St CE 181 191 Figure 1: Input structure to sentence planner"]},{"title":"5 The discourse marker lexicon in sentence planning","paragraphs":["Having outlined the discourse marker lexicon as a general resource, we now turn to the question of using it in sentence planning. Even though the lexicon is still under development, we will illustrate with several prototypical representations how a sentence planner can exploit the various realization options offered by the lexicon.","We assume the following framework: a discourse structure tree loosely based on RST [Mann and Thompson 1988] serves as input to the sentence planner. RS-trees comprise a set of propositions as leaf nodes; the internal nodes represent coherence relations holding between the daughter nodes. The tree is encoded in the description logic LOOM [MacGregor and Bates 1987], and the propositions are represented following the ontology used in the MOOSE system [Stede 1996]. The nature Of these representations need not concern us here, but it is important thatthey are all \"grounded\" in a knowledge base so that type checking via subsumption can take place.","The output of the sentence planning module is a sequence of lexicalised sentence-semantic specifications (SemSpecs), based on SPL [Kasper 1989]. Accordingly, sentence planning in this framework amounts to linearizing a discourse representation tree. As front-end sentence generator, we use KPML [Bateman 1997].

We propose these categories:","• Applicability conditions: The necessary conditions that need to be present in the input representation for the marker to be a candidate. Chiefly, this is the semantic/discourse relation to be expressed, and also (if applicable) features pertaining to presuppositions and intentions. 133","• Combinability conditions: The constraints that the marker imposes on its neighbouring linguistic constituents (the 'syntagmatic' dimension). These are syntactic constraints on subcategorization and semantic type constraints, which interact with other realization decisions in sentence planning.","• Distinguishing features: If preferential choice dimensions, such as style, brevity, etc., are attended to in the •system, then these features serve to distinguish markers that are otherwise (nearly) synonymous (the 'paradigmatic' dimension).","For encoding this information, we adopt the framework used in the lexicalization approach of the MOOSE sentence generator [Stede 1996].
