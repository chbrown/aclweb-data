Although Japanese is correctly classified as a strongly centripetal language according to linear survey (relevd lin~aire, p. 33), no examples of Japanese are cited. Consequentl); we have endeavored to apply Tesni~re's ideas to Japanese by manually constructing the linguistic structures for more than six thousand sentences of a corpus of hotel reservation conversations.","In fact, Tesni~re's grammatical ideas, and among them, the most original ones, fit well to Japanese as they give simple and insightful descriptions of some usually controversial grammatical phenomena (ergative constructions, na-adjectives).","After describing the different types and categories of words, we will focus on the three phenomena to which, according to Tesni~re, all syntactical phenomena reduce: connection, junction and transference. From the representational point of view, we will introduce correspondence intervals to code which part of the surface text corresponds to which nodes or sub-trees. 1 WORDS We have taken the character (kana or kanji), which is the physical unit of a Japanese text, as the unit of measure of the length of a section of text. With the convention of starting at position O, we locate any piece of text, and hence words, using an interval notation. Note that there is no word separator (or blank spaces) in Japanese. In the following sentence 1, the word t~m is located by the interval [3_5] and the word ~.'C by [6.9]. This notation will be used in correspondences (Section 2.2). 11 ~ 12 ~ 13o Could I get a room upstairs ¢. 1.1 Species and Categories of Words The differentiation between: content words, which are associated with a concept, and function words, which express syntactical informa-tion was not difficult to apply to Japanese. 1.1.1 Content Words Some examples of content words include :~.~ (yoyaku, reservation), ~L~ (okureru, to be late), ~ (takai, expensive), ~ (tyokusetu, directly). Tesni~re distinguishes between two categories of content words: processes and substances, which are, for explanation purposes, usually exemplified by verbs and nouns, respectively, in Indo-European languages. This is also consistent with Japanese.","These two categories are in turn divided into: concrete and abstract categories, which opposes the concrete notion of processes and substances to their abstract attributes, and gives rise to the following categorisation for content words (see also (Starosta 88), Tesni~re's notations is shown in capitals). concrete abstract","substmlces processes","substantive verbal O !","adjectival adverbial A E","l Except when mentioned, examples axe from tile tree-baak. 109","It is to be noted that, in the case of Japanese, two categories of words are variable in relation to aspect and negation: abstract substances (A) and concrete processes (I), which are respectively (i-)adjectives and verbs in terms of Japanese grammars.","Now, some classes of words, which pose problems in Japanese grammar books written in Engush, such as the so-called na-adjectives (W~\" (sizuka, quiet)), and the Sino-Japanese nouns-verbs formed in conjunction with use of the Japanese verb -J-70 (suru, to do), can easily be categorised as nouns (O). This is consistent with w'hat is taught in Japanese schools, (see Appendix B), their syntactical behaviour being prefectly described by transference (see Section 4). 1.1.2 Function Words Grammatical tools, the role of which is to either make explicit, or change the category of a content word, or to define relationships between words, are called function words. These words will appear in eztenso in structural representations.","In Japanese, many can be easily identified, such as, 7~ (ga, t~, nominative case post° particule), 69 (no, J~{~'J, genitive case postparticle), 69\"~ (node, ~l~'J, equivalent to subordinate conjunction), 7)~ (ka, ~.~, end of interrogative sentence particle), 3\"70 (suru, +)\" \"~B~, support verb for Sino-Japanese nouns), etc.","Of course, some function words can also be content words in a different context. For in-stance, the verb \"J-70 (suru), is either the support verb for Sino-Japanese nouns, (a function word in that case), or the verb \"to do\" (a content word). 2 CONNECTION Tesni~re speaks of connection to describe the relations between words in a sentence in terms of their subordination relations. This concept in-cludes predicate-argument or governor-modifier relations as w-eU as predicate-circumstantial relations (Eldments, p. 14). The study of sentences, which is the proper object of structural syntaz is essentially the study of its structure, i.e. the hierarchy of its connections. 2.1 Tree Representation: Stemmas Tesni~re was the first to propose, in 1934, to systematically use graphical representations 2 which he called sternmas, for representing this hierarchy (Tesni~re 34). However, these stemmas were more than simple trees. Although, we will show that the introduction of correspondence makes it possible to encode Tesni~re's representations using just trees.","Basic connections are those which link concrete notions with their abstract attributes (Figure 1). yasui hoteru hayaku cheap hotel quickly tukimasu arrive Figure 1: Basic connections.","By replacing content words with their class (O, I, A, E) \"virtual\" stemmas (on the right) can be derived from the \"real\" ones (on the left). 2.2 Correspondences To explicitly indicate which word, or more specifically, especially in the case of Japanese, which chunk of text corresponds to which node in the stemma, we adopted the use of correspondences (Boitet and Zaharin 88).","We note two kinds of correspondence: • words-to-node, and","• sentence parts-to-complete substring-to-subtree. subtree, or Constraints Correspondences are noted by intervals, as introduced above, and are governed by three constraints (Lepage 94).","• global correspondence: an entire tree corresponds to an entire sentence;","2He acknowledged that two Russian linguists used trees in 1930 to explain some syntactic phenomenon, but, unlike Tesni~re, the use of trees was not pivotal in their explanations. 110"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["• inclusion: a subtree which is part of another subtree T, must correspond to a substring in the substring corresponding to T;","• membership: a node in a subtree T, must correspond to words members of the substring corresponding to T."]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["12 ta 0"]},{"title":"0","paragraphs":["0_2/0..2 3_6/3_6"]},{"title":"o~2","paragraphs":["tyousyoku :breakfast' narimasu :become' t:t 3 Y~U~\" e t: r ha beturyoukin ni TOP 'extra charge' LOC Breakfast is not inchtded. Figure 2: A sentence and its associated stemma.","In Figure 2, on each node of the stemma, two intervals stand for the words-node and the substring-subtree correspondences, in that or-der. The entire sentence 3 extends from 0 to 11, as indicated by the root. This root is a verb, de-noted as I, and is located in position 7 to 11: f.¢ 19 ~ 3\"- (narimasu). Similarly, the node labelled t: (hi) corresponds as a word to the case-maker ~:, which extends from 6 to 7 in the sentence. The entire subtree dominated by the node corresponds to the phrase ~lJ~: (beturyoukin hi) which extends from 3 to 7. Discontinuous Intervals Discontinuous intervals are possible. In Figure 3, the deverbative noun ~b~ (negai, request) from ~li') (negau, to ask for) takes an accusative argument extend-ing from 0 to 4, ~3~1~\" (o+namae wo, your","\"~Refer to Table A in Appendix for notations used in glosses. 111 name). Because the honorific prefix ~3 + (o+) can only be applied to a noun, obtained by at-taching the suffix + b~ (+i) (transference, see Section 4), the subtree dominated by the verbal root corresponds to a non-connex substring [0_4]+[5.6] in the surface form: ~3~'k ... ~1I.","/-3+ I 4-5/4.5"]},{"title":"5-610-4+5-6","paragraphs":["~+"]},{"title":"0_1/0_1","paragraphs":["o namae wo o negai simasu HON 'name' ACC HON 'request' 'do' What is your name, please? Figure 3: A case of a discontinuous interval. 2.3 Predicate-Argument Structures Free-Order- Subject A main feature of dependency structures, to which Tesni~re's representations pertains, is that they do not provide any preferred position to the subject (see Fourquet's foreword to (Grdciano and Schureacher 96), and (Zemb 78), p. 393, for a discussion). This corresponds particularly well with our data because the free ordering of case-marked phrases (not words) is a property of Japanese, which makes dependency grammars more adequate in its description 4. For exam-","4(Mel'~uk 88) and (Starv6ta 88), among others have already commented that constituency structures are English-oriented representations into which some linguists try desperately to cast other languages. An illustration is (Gunji 87). After a ten-page discussion, and despite an honest acknowledgment that there is absolutely no basis for this, he draws the conclusion that a preferred position for the subject, as a left sister of the pie, the two following propositions are equally valid, where location and subject have been exchanged. rokunin ga hitoheya ni ireru '6-people' NOM 'l-room' LOC 'can-enter' a room that can accommodate 6 people --g~ ~z ~A ~ hitoheya ni rokunin ga 'l-room' LOC '6-people' NOM L. fL ;b . . . ireru... 'can-enter' a room that can accommodate 6 people Omission Moreover, in Japanese, the omission of any of the case-marked phrases is possible. One can perfectly imagine a situation where a traveler first announces that he is in a group of 6 people, and then merely utters the following sentence: --~ ~z X.~,~ hitoheya ni ireru 'one-room' LOC 'can-enter' a room that can accommodate 6 people This sentence has no subject, and yet it is unambiguously understood as a request for a room which can accommodate 6 people altogether. Ergative Constructions Moreover, the search for the \"real subject\", as opposed to the syntactical subject, is meaningless in dependency representations of ergative constructions. Such constructions exist in Japanese 5 with a range of adjectives, such as, ~ L.~ ~ (hosii) (20 occurrences in our corpus), or verbal forms in -t~,~ (tai) (around 310 occurrences in the corpus), or the so-calhd \"passive\" or \"medio-passive\" verbs, such as, gP.. 1o (mieru, c.f. Fr. se voir). verb, has to be postulated for Japanese, because.., it is so in English.","5However, the ergative case does not exist in Japanese, and it would be difficult to call Japanese an ergative language (see (Mel'euk 88), p. 250-253, for definitions concerning ergativity). 112 ~a0~ $~ ~b~,~ ... snityuumegane ga hosii 'goggles' NOM 'want'","I want goggles Figure 4: An ergative construction. Auxiliary Verbs In an original and interest-ing discussion, Tesni~re advocates that the subject and the object of a French passd composdof a transitive verb, do not both link to the past participle. He shows that some clues indicate that the subject links to the auxiliary, while the object should be linked with the past participle. Similar analysis seems particularly well adapted to some Japanese constructions too, not because of the agreement in gender-number, but because of case semantics.","For instance, in the following sentence, the subject, postal code, cannot be considered the subject of the verb, to write °. yuubinbangou ga kaite aru 'postal code' NOM 'write' 'is' The postal code is written (e.g. on an enve-","lope)","However, changing the auxiliary, ab~ (aru) into b~ 7o (iru) implies a change in the case of postal code. yuubinbangou wo kaite iru 'postal code' ACC 'write' 'is' The postal code is being written (e.g. by Lu-","cien) - Somebody is writing the postal code.","This convinced us to adopt Tesni~re's analysis, where the subject is linked with the auxiliary (Figure 5).","¢1~'~ (kaite) is a non-conclusive, pending, form of the verb 8 < (kaku), which is translated in English by \"writing ~ or \"written\" according to the context."]},{"title":"I I I I I, I I I I I I","paragraphs":["IT","ET ~3 ~ 8-1i/0-5+8-10","I + ~ ~ 5_7/5.8 7.8/7.8 4.5/0. 5 0"]},{"title":"o.4/o_4","paragraphs":["yuubinbangou ga"]},{"title":"kaite","paragraphs":["aru","'postal code' NOM 'write' 'is'","The postal code is written Figure 5: Auxiliary dependency. 3 JUNCTION Junction gathers the facts of coordination, and factorisation.","Junction words in Japanese include words such as ~ (to, and for nouns), ~ (ya, or for nouns), L (si, or for verbs), ~;t 2\" (kedo, but). We propose to represent them with one node bearing a special label: we prefix and suffix by - the function word. Accordingly, we can easily represent cap junctions as in Figure 6. ikkai to tikaikk~i ni 'first-floor' 'and' 'basement floor' LOC On the first and basement floors Figure 6: A case of a cap junction.","On the other hand, in cup cases, the same de-pendent shares several governors. A tree can be '~factored\" by using a special node, V, bearing 113 the same correspondences as its root.

This is a significant difference to constituency representations, but conforms with Tesni~re's description (e.g. p. 649). Figure 7 is such an example. 4 TRANSFERENCE Transference r, in essence, consists in transferring to a content word of a given category the function or role of another category. According to Tesni~re, it is precisely this transference which aUows a speaker of any language to never be stopped by the fact that a needed concept does not fit, by category, into the role required at a given point in an utterance. Transferer Transference applies to a content word, called the transferee. It is performed by a transferer, which may be:","• a function word 69 (no, of), ~:- (hi, to), T (sum, to do), etc.","7Here, we follow the recommendation of Tesni~re himself to render the French word translation with this English term especially coined for the meaning here."]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I l","paragraphs":["some morphological device ¢ < (ku, adverbial form of adjectives), ¢ \"C (re, pending form of verbs), etc. no mark at all (the so-called \"relatives\" of Japanese are in fact transferences: a verb is transferred into an adjective without any marker). In this case, we indicate the transferer node by ¢. As a result of transference, the category of","the content word has been transformed into an-","other category so that it can play the role of the","resulting category. For instance: ,-k,,'Y-Jt~:O ~ ,~,-Y-Jp0):A hoteru hoteru no hotel of the hotel Representation Depending on the position of the transferer, left and right transferences have to be distinguished. In Japanese, the transferer is predominantly on the right of the transferee. We represent the transference with the help of a 3-node subtree to render Tesni~re's capital T notation:","• the mother node bears the target category, followed (or preceded) by T if the transferer is on the right of the transferee in the sentence, (usual case in Japanese), or on the left.;","• the left (or right) daughter bears the transferee, represented by its category;","• the other daughter bears the transferer, £e. the function word in extenso.","A mother node does not correspond to any word in the surface text so it bears an empty interval (denoted as [n_n], with any u). However, as the root of a subtree, it represents the sum of the intervals of all its subtrees. Na-Adjectlves A class of Sino-Japanese nouns exists in Japanese, extended in contemporanean Japanese by a full range of English-Japanese nouns (Sells 96) (~--- ~' f,c (yuniikuna. unique), 7 I/.:p -~ :~ fo¢ (huressyu-na, fresh)), which could be semantically interpreted as adjectives, but follow a specific syntactical behaviour, different from standard adjectives end-ing in ~ (i) (Appendix C). They are the so-called na-adjectives in Japanese grammar books AT","0 a) 0_3/0_3 3.4/3.4 o ~\" \"Y'~V 3 o~ 4 Figure 8: Representation of transference. written in English, although in Japanese terminology they are described as noun-adjectives.","In attributive positions, these words require a special function word, tx (na). We analysed t.c as a transferer of nouns (0) into adjectives (A). This view meets that of (Kuwae 89), vol 1, p. 185, who considers that, \"t~ (da) is the only variable word in Japanese for which there exists a determinative form, t,c (ha), distinct from the conclusive form.\" CONCLUSION We have presented a tree-bank of 6553 sentences of Japanese conversations in the domain of hotel reservations , which uses Tesni~re's structural syntax framework. Correspondences between surface texts and trees are ensured by means of intervals.","It has long been felt in the NLP Japanese community that a dependency approach fits well to the description of Japanese. The privileged place for the subject in constituency descriptions generates artificial problems, whereas, dependency allows simple and direct description of phenomena like, for in-stance, ergative constructions.","Moreover, Tesni~re's original ideas give a clear insight to some area. For instance, the attachment of arguments under auxiliaries better renders case semantics. Also, transference permits a simple analysis of \"na-adjectives\", which respects the feeling of native speakers of Japanese. 114 A"]},{"title":"B","paragraphs":["Grammatical Labels Used in","Glosses symbol particle or","example TOP l;t (ha) NOM 7) t (ga) ACC ~ (wo) LOC ~: (ni)","\"~ (de) HON ~3 + (o+) honorific","+ (go+) topicalisatioff\" nominative accusative locative Structural Syntax Categories and Japanese School Grammar Classes symbol class example 0 ~ , ~-~t~ (~L~)","nouns :~ (#~J)","~\" (~$~)","-t-~L;~9 * :,' (~$) adj. .1: ~ Lb~ (~)","verbs fz 19 it-J- (+iT) ~ Lt: (+to) adv. 12~\" (~,]~) C I-Adjectives and \"Na-Adjectives\" polite takai desu it is expensive sizuka desu it is quiet","predicative , [familiar takai (it's) erpen. sire ~h~fY. sizuka da (it's) quiet attributive takai heya desu it is an expensive rooffl sizuka na heya desu it is a quiet room References","Christian Boitet and Zaharin Yusoff Representation trees and string-tree correspondences Proceedings of COLING-88, Budapest, 1988, pp 59-64.","Gunji Takao Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar D.
