We exemplify the method by addressing the question, \"What percentage of Federal Register documents are real documents, of possible interest to a text researcher or analyst?\" We estimate an answer to this question by evaluating 200 documents selected from a corpus of 45,820 Federal Register documents. Stratified sampling is used to reduce the sampling uncertainty of the estimate from over 3100 documents to fewer than 11300. The stratification is based on observed characteristics of real documents, while the sampling procedure incorporates a Bayesian version of Neyrnan allocation. A possible application of the method is to establish baseline statistics used to estimate recall rates for information retrieval systems. Introduction The traditional task in information retrieval is to find documents from a large corpus that are relevant to a query. In this paper we address a related task: answering statistical questions about a corpus. Instead of finding the documents that match a query, we quantify the percentage of documents that match it.","The method is designed to address statistical questions that are:","Â• subjective: that is, informed readers may disagree about which documents match the query, and the same reader may make different judgment at different times. This characteristic describes most queries of real interest to text researchers.","Â• difficult: that is, one cannot define an algorithrn to reliably assess individual documents, and thus the corpus as a whole. This characteristic follows naturally from","the first. It may be compounded by an in-","sufficient understanding of a corpus, or a","shortcoming in one's tools for analyzing it.","Statistical questions asked of small corpora can be answered exhaustively, by reading and scoring every document in the corpus. Such answers will be subjective, since judgments about the individual documents are subjective. For a large corpus, it is not feasible to read every document. Instead, one must sample a subset of documents, then extrapolate the resuits of the sample to the corpus as a whole. The conclusions that one draws from such a sampling will have two components: the estimated answer to the question, and a confidence interval around the estimate.","The method described in this paper combines traditional statistical sampling techniques (Cochran (1963), Kalton (1983)) with Bayesian analysis (Bayes (1763), Berger (1980)) to reduce this sampling uncertainty. The method is well-grounded in statistical theory, but its application to textual queries is novel. One begins by stratifying the data using objective tests designed to yield relatively homogeneous strata, within which most documents either match or do not match the query. Then one samples randomly within each stratum, with the number of documents sampled per stratum determined through the analysis of a presampie. A reader scores each selected document, and the results of the different strata are combined. If the strata are well constructed, the resuiting estimate about the corpus will have a much smaller credibility interval (the Bayesian version of a confidence interval) than one based on a sample of the corpus as a whole.","The method is well suited for subjective queries because it brings a human reader's subjective judgments to bear on individual documents. The Bayesian approach that we apply to this problem allows a second opportunity for the reader to influence the results of the sampling. The reader can construct a probability density that summarizes his or her prior expectations about each stratum. These prior expectations are combined with pre-sampling results to determine the makeup of the final sample. When the final sample is analyzed, the prior expectations are again factored in, influencing the estimated mean and the size of the credibility interval. Thus different readers' prior expectations, and their judgments of individual documents, can lead to substantiially different results, which is consistent with the subjective probability paradigm.","In earlier work we used this method to analyze medical records, asking, \"What percentage of the patients are female?\" (Thomas et al. (1995)). The lack of a required gender field in the record format made this a subjective question, especially for records that did not specify the patient's gender at all, or gave conflicting clues. We stratified the corpus into probable male and female records based on linguistic tests such as the number of female versus male pronouns in a record, then sampled within each stratum. Stratification reduced the sampling uncertainty for the question from fourteen percentage points (based on an overall sample of 200 records) to five (based on a stratified sample of the same size).","In this paper, we update the method and apply it to a new corpus, the"]},{"title":"Federal Register.","paragraphs":["The main change from Thomas et al.

For example, we use a non-parametric prior density instead of a beta density, and combine posterior densities between strata using a Monte Carlo simulation rather than weighted means and variances. Other differences, such as a Bayesian technique for allocating samples between strata, and a new method for determining the size of the credibility interval, are noted in the text."]},{"title":"The Federal Register","paragraphs":["corpus is of general interest because it is part of the TIPSTER collection.

Determining the percentage of real documents would serve to evaluate the true size of the corpus, and its usefulness for TIPSTER type applications where documents relevant to topic queries are expected to be returned.","This query matched the two criteria set forth in the Introduction for applicability to our method.

As another example, readers might disagree about which erratum documents are significant enough to be considered real documents themselves. 3 Overall estimation and the Bayesian approach We will illustrate the Bayesian approach in the context of a straw man effort to estimate the percentage of real documents without stratifying the corpus. From the entire 45,820 document set, we sampled 200 documents at random. Sampling was done with replacement (i.e., we did not remove sampled documents from the population); however, no documents were observed to be selected twice. One of our researchers then reviewed the documents and judged them as real documents versus pseudo-documents. He did this by reading the first fifty lines of each document.","Of the 200 documents sampled, 187, or 0.935, were judged to be real documents; this served as our initial estimate for the overall percentage of real documents in the corpus. We then used Bayesian techniques to modify this estimate based on our prior expectations about the population. This was a three-step process. First, we calculated the binomial likelihood function corresponding to the sampling results. Second, we encoded our prior expectations in a likelihood function. Third, we combined the binomial and prior likelihood functions to create a"]},{"title":"posterior probability density.","paragraphs":["This posterior served as the basis for the final estimate and credibility interval. 3.1 Binomial likelihood function The standard binomial likelihood function associated with the sampling result (187 real documents out of 200),","200! x 187 (l-x) 13, (1) f(x)- 187!13! is graphed in Figure 1.

The researcher's input consisted of eleven likelihood values, at intervals of 0.1 on the x axis, as shown in Figure 2. These points were then splined to obtain a likelihood function (Fig. 2; see Press et al. (1988)) and normalized to obtain a probability density.

This yielded a credibility interval between 0.8908 and 0.9606. As an alternative, we calculated the credibility interval exactly, in a numerical fashion that yielded the tightest possible interval and thus somewhat reduced the final uncertainty of the estimate. To do so we moved outward from the peak of the density, summing under the curve until we reached a total probability of 0.95. At each step outwards from the peak we considered probability values to the fight and left and chose the larger of the two. This method also finds a tighter interval than the numerical method used in Thomas et al. (1995), which was based on finding the left and right tails that each contained 0.025 of the density.","The credibility interval found for the posterior probability density using the exact method is summarized in Table 1, in percentages of real documents and in numbers of real documents.

This process involved dividing the data into two relatively homogeneous strata, one containing mostly real documents, the other mostly pseudo-documents, and combining sampling results from the two strata.","This approach is advantageous because the variance of a binomial density, ~ (where n is the number sampled, and p the percentage of \"yes\" answers), shrinks dramatically for extreme values of p. Therefore, one can generally reduce sampling uncertainty by combining results from several homogeneous strata, rather than doing an overall sample from a heterogeneous population.","As with our overall sample, we performed the stratified sampling within the Bayesian framework. The steps described in Section 3 for the overall sample were repeated for each stratum (with an additional step to allocate samples to the strata), and the posteriors from the strata were combined for the final estimate. 4.1 Defining strata and allocating the samples We divided the documents into two strata: apparent real documents, and apparent pseudo-documents. The basis for the division was the observation that most pseudo-documents were of the following types: 1. Part dividers (title pages for subparts of an","issue) 2. Title pages 3. Tables of contents 4. Reader Aids Sections 5. Instructions to insert illustrations not pre-","sent in the electronic version 6. Null documents (no text material between","<TEXT> and </TEXT> markers) 7. Other defective documents, such as titles of","presidential proclamations that were sepa-","rated from the proclamation itself.","We wrote a short Per1 script that recognized pseudo-document types 1-4 using key phrases (e.g., />Part [IVXM]/ for Part dividers), and types 5-7 by their short length. This test stratified the data into 3444 apparent pseudo-documents and 42,376 apparent real documents.","Exploration of the strata showed that this stratification was not perfect -- indeed, if it were, we could no longer call this query difficult!

However, we will see that the stratification sufficed to sharply reduce the credibility interval.","Before doing the stratified sampling, we had to decide how many documents to sample from each stratum. In a departure from Thomas et al. (1995), we used a Bayesian modification of Neyman allocation to do this. Traditional Neyman allocation requires a pre-sampling, of each stratum to determine its heterogeneity; heterogeneous strata are then sampled more intensively. In Newbold's Bayesian modification (1971), prior expectations for each stratum are combined with pre-5 sample results to create a posterior densiry for each stratum. These posteriors are then used to determine the allocation.","This technique therefore required creating posterior densities for each stratum that blended a prior density and a presample. Accordingly, we devised priors for the two strata -- apparent pseudo-documents, and apparent real documents -- based on our exploratory analysis of the strata. As in the overall analysis (Section 3.2), we splined the priors to five significant digits. The original (unsplined) priors are graphed in Figure 4. 1.0 0.8 \\ 0.6 0.4 0.2 (","0.0 0.00 x- -- ~< apparent ps~udo-dooJments ~-] O----O apparent real documents","i \\ \\ \\ ~ 0 \\~ . //","- ~ ..0-----0",".---O---O - -- O---.O-7-~.O--'~ ~- - -~ - - ~ - .-x- - - i i i i 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 Possible true proporlion of real documents Figure 4.

The presample results were perfect -- all apparent pseudo-documents were pseudo-documents, and all apparent real documents were real. We applied Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior density for each stratum, multiplying the binomial likelihood function associated with the stratum's presample by the relevant prior density, and normalizing.","With these posteriors in hand, we were ready to determine the optimum allocation among the strata.

The outcome of this procedure was an allocation of 15 apparent pseudo-documents and 185 apparent real documents. 4.2 Posteriors for each stratum Having already sampled ten documents from each stratum, we now sampled an additional 5 apparent pseudo-documents and 175 apparent real documents to make up the full sample. We chose documents randomly with replacement and judged each document subjectively as above. To our surprise (knowing that the stratification was error-prone), this sampling again gave perfect results: all apparent pseudo-documents were pseudo-documents, and all apparent real documents were real.","We applied Bayes' theorem a final time to derive a new posterior probability density for each stratum based on the results of the full sample. For each stratum, we multiplied the binomial likelihood function corresponding to the full sampling results (0/15 and 185/185) by the prior probability density for each stratum (i.e., the posterior density from the presample), then normalized. 4~3 Combining the results: Monte Carlo simulation The final step was to combine the two postedors to obtain an estimate and credibility interval for the population as a whole. The traditional approach would be to find the mean and variance for each stratum's posterior and combine these according to each stratum's weight in the population.

Recall is the percentage of relevant documents fiar a query that an IR system actually finds. To establish recall, one must know how many relevant documents exist. The standard technique for estimating this number is \"pooling\": identifying relevant documents from among those returned by all IR systems involved in a comparison. This method is used by the TREC program (Voorhees and Harman (1997)). Our method is a principled alternative to this method that is well-grounded in statistical theory, and, unlike pooling, is independent of any biases present in current IR systems.","Applying the method to a new question, whether for its own sake or to determine recall, involves developing a stratification test, constructing a prior density for each stratum, performing the presample and full samples, and combining the results. Of these steps, stratification is the most important in reducing the credibility interval. In our work to date we have achieved good results with stratification tests that are conceptually and computationally simple. We suspect that when asking multiple questions of the same corpus, it may even be possible to automate the construction of stratification scripts. Priors are easiest to construct if the strata are clean and well-understood.","The appropriate amount of time to invest in refining a stratification test and the associated priors depends on the cost of evaluating documents and the importance of a small credibility interval. If documents are easy to evaluate, one might choose to put less time into stratification and priors construction, and reduce the credibility interval by increasing sample size. If one is restricted to a small sample, then accurate stratification and good priors are more important. If one requires an extremely tight confidence interval, then careful stratification and prior construction, and a generous sample, are all recommended."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of California for the United States Department of Energy under contract W-7405-ENG-36.
