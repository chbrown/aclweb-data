Single-headedness and projectivity are assumed. This approach has the benefit of making general constraint-based context-free grammar parsing facilities available to DG analysis. This paper describes an experimental implementation of this approach using unification to realize grammatical function constraints imposed on a dependency structure backbone emulated by a context-flee grammar. Treating complements of a head word using subcategoHzation lists residing in the head word makes it possible to keep phrase-structure-rule-like mechanisms to the minimum. Adjuncts are treated with a syntactic mechanism that does not reside in the lexicon in this generally lexical approach to grammar. Introduction The mathematical properties of Dependency Grammar (Tesniere (1959)) are studied by Gaifman (1965) and Hays (1964). Following their footsteps, Robinson (1970) formulates four axioms to govern the weU-formedness of dependency structures: (a) One and only one element is independent; (b) All others depend directly on some element; (c) No element depends directly on more than one other;, (d) If A depends directly on B and some element C intervenes between them (in linear order ofs~ing), then C depends directly on A or on B or some other intervening element. These axioms require that all words should depend on only one word and that, arranging words in linear order, crossing of dependency links as in Fig.l should not be allowed.

DG parsing of Chinese have used statistical corpus-based algorithms (Huang et al. (1992), Yuan and Huang.

As in LFG, the grammatical function structure, which provides the constraining mechanism, is mathematically a graph rather than a tree. This relieves the syntactic dependency component of any need to be multiple-headed and non-projective (Lai and Huang 1995). Following this approach, Lai and Huang (in press) describes a unification-based (Shieber (1986)) experimental parser adapted from the PATR parser in Gazdar and Mellish (1989). Control and simple semantic analysis are handled.","The present paper discusses issues of using a constrained CFG to emulate DG. Section 1 explains the implications of Robinson's axioms and describes Hays' CFG-like formulation of dependency rules. Section 2 formulates the \"dependency rule with grammatical function annotation\" model and describes its emulation with PATR. Section 3 discusses how the lexical orientation of DG motivates a proper distinction between complements subeategorized for by the head and adjuncts that are not, and describes how this can be accomplished in a constrained CFG emulation using subcategorization lists in the lexicon. A distinction between grammatical information residing and not residing in the lexicon is noted. Section 4 discusses the real nature of the constrained CFG emulation of DG.

In his foreword in Starosta (1988), Hudson mentioned three characteristics of DG. First, DG should be monostrata! in the sense that there should be no transformations. Second, dependency should be basic, not derived. Third, the rules of grammar should not be formally distinct from subcategorization facts. Lai and Huang's approach meets the first two criteria. While the proper treatment of adjuncts will be discussed below, the close coupling of the phrase-structure-rule-like dependency rules and subcategorization properties discussed in the previous section also gives the approach the third characteristic.","One may feel somewhat uncomfortable about phrase-structure rules or phrase-structure-rule like mechanisms playing an important role in an emulation of DG. After all, although it is true that Hays' rules work like phrase structure rules, conformation to Robinson's axioms does not imply that the process of sentence recognition will necessarily have an image in a PSG. The situation is particularly critical in the treatment of adjuncts that are not subcategorized for by a head word. We could quite easily deal with adjunct in the manner of the following annotated phrase structure rule in LFG:","VP --* V NP ZP (1'obj) = $ ('l'adjunct) = But we would then have to let a large number of phrase structure rules not related to subcategorization facts slip into the grammar. This violates the third criterion mentioned above and is obviously undesirable.","This being a critical problem of constrained CFG emulation of DG, we adopt another approach by exploiting the fact that the categorical labels of"]},{"title":"106","paragraphs":["a head word and it's dominating nodes are the same.

The two X's on the two sides of the arrow are short-hand for two different symbols, say XI and X2, constrained by the condition XI :cat = X2:cat.","As subcategorization information has to be encoded in the lexical items anyway, there is nothing seriously wrong with phrase-structure-rule-like stipulations about complements. However, we should note that, in Chinese and English, adjuncts generally do not come between a head word and its \"unmoved\" non-subject complements. This could be taken care of by adding a bar-level feature to the rules in Fig. l ! as in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG, Gazdar et al. (1985)). But then we would be relying more heavily on phrase-structure-rule-like mechanisms. Instead of this, we find the alternative method of treatment in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, Pollard and Sag (! 994)) convenient.","First, lexical entries are as in Fig. 12:"]},{"title":"gei ('give')","paragraphs":["cat= v subcat.left = [n(subj)] subcat.right = [n(iobj), n(obj)]"]},{"title":"Fig. 12","paragraphs":["Rules like the following (necessary details only, for brevity) will take care of complements subcategorized for by the head word:","V _+ V X (cat(fun) = pop('V:subcat.right)} % fails if V:subcat = n X:cat = cat X:fun = fun","V ._~ X V {cat(fun) = pop(V:subcat.left)} % fails ifV:subcat = U X:cat = cat X:fun = fun Fig. 13 Adjuncts are kept from getting in between a head word and its unmoved non-subject complements by adding constraints like X: subcat.right = [] to rules in Fig. 11","As shown in Fig. 12, a lexical entry has two subcategorization"]},{"title":"lists,","paragraphs":["one for complements on its left and one for complements on its right, an inspiration from Yuan and Huang (1992).

Adjustments are required for moved complements. Adjustments are also required for other languages.","It should be noted that the rules, in the spirit of Robinson's axioms, try not to meddle with word order as far as possible. In this respect, PATR is inelegant in that it has to have two symmetrical adjunct rules in Fig. !I and two symmetrical complement rules in Fig. 13. This inelegance seems to be inherent in the PSG nature of PATR. 4 Nature of the Emulation Model An examination of the real nature of our emulation model is in order.

We believe that their existence (in small numbers) is justified in our emulation model. Even in a DG formalism that does not have phrase-structure-like rules, there have to be some general facilities to take care of such non-lexical grammatical mechanisms. DG is lexically orientated, but it has to cope with non-lexical grammatical mechanisms, where they exist, in language.","The dependency rule cum functional constraint emulation in Lai and Huang (1994; 1995; in press) has obviously been influenced by LFG. With the introduction of mechanisms to handle complements and adjuncts in the previous section, the emulation model has moved towards HPSG. Grammatical function constraints, which work like functional annotations in LFG, provide the main facilities to resolve grammatical problems like control. On the other hand, dependency rules, emulated by PATR phrase-structure rules, are kept to a minimum and deals with subeategorization and adjoining with a l-IPSG-like mechanism.","The emulation model, however, remains an emulation. The Chinese parsing experiments from which the generalization has been made do not all use (context-free) phrase structure rules (e.g. 107"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["Yuan et al. (1992); Zhou and Huang (1994)). PATR rules are useful only in so far as they can produce structures that can be transformed to dependency structures. Conclusion We have thus been committed in our efforts to emulate a Robinson-style Dependency Grammar with a lexically oriented Context-Free Grammar constrained by grammatical function annotations. Besides providing a formalism for valid and illuminating linguistic analysis, this emulation has enabled us to implement a unification-based parser in PATR. We are however not necessarily committed to the claim that Dependency Grammar is a notational variant of Phrase Structure Grammar. Robinson-style dependency structures have great affinity with phrase structure trees, but they do not have to be generated by phrase structure rules. In fact, phrase structure rule-based emulation is inelegant in handling some phenomena that DG can deal with elegantly.
