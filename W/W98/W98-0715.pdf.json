An underspecified semantic class is an abstract semantic class which encodes systematic polysem~f, a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways. We show the usefulness of the induced classes in the semantic in-terpretations and contextual inferences of real-word texts by applying them to the predicate-argument structures in Brown corpus. 1 Introduction WordNet (Miller, 1990) has been used as a general resource of broad-coverage lexical information in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including sense tagging, text summarization and machine translation. However, like other large-scale knowledge-base systems or machine readable dictionaries (MRDs), WordNet contains massive ambiguity and redundancy. In particular, since WordNet senses are more fine-grained than most other MRDs such as LDOCE (Procter, 1978), each word entry is more ambiguous. For example, WordNet 1.6 (released December 1997) lists the following 9 senses for the verb write: 1. write, compose, pen, indite - produce a","literary work 2. write - communicate or express by writing 3. publish, write - have (one's written work)","issued for publication 4. write, drop a line - communicate (with) in","writing 5. write - communicate by letter 6. compose, write- write music 7. write - mark or trace on a surface 8. write - record data on a computer 9. spell, write - write or name the letters These fine sense distinctions may not be desired in some applications. Consequently any system which incorporates WordNet without customization must presume this redundancy, and may need to control the ambiguities in order to make the computation tractable.","Although the redundancy in WordNet could be a drawback, it can be an ideal resource for a broad-coverage domain-independent semantic lexicon based on underspecified semantic classes (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998). An underspecified semantic class is an abstract semantic type which encodes systematic polysemy (or regular polysemy (Apresjan, 1973)): 1 a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways (eg. INSTITUTION and BUILDING meanings of the word school). These related word senses are grouped together, and assigned an abstract semantic class that generalizes the relation. This way, we do not need to distinguish or disambiguate word senses that encompass several semantic \"axes\", and we can regard azt underspecified class as a multi-dimensional semantic entity. This abstract class is underspecified because it does not specify either one of the member senses. Here, in building a lexicon based on such underspecified semantic classes, redundancy in WordNet is a desirable property since the amount of information lost by abstraction is minimized. Also, since WordNet sense entries are taken from general but wide range of domains, systematic polysemy can be extracted from the dictionary rather than from a sense-tagged corpus. Therefore, data sparseness problems become less significant. Then, the resulting lexicon can effectively compact the redundancy and ambiguity in WordNet by two dimensions: abstraction and systematic polysemy.","The use of underspecified semantic classes is one of the underspecification techniques being investigated in recent years (van Deemter and Peters,","I Note that systematic polysemy should be contrasted with homonymy which refers to words which have more than one unrelated sense (eg. FINAN-CIAL_INSTITUTION and SLOPING_LAND meanings of the word bank)."]},{"title":"108 I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["1996). This underspecified class has several advantages. First, it can compactly represent the ambiguity which arises from multiple related senses. Thus it is more expressive and computationaUy efficient than single sense representations. Second, it can facilitate abductive inference through the systematicity between senses: given a word with n related senses, the identification of one sense in a context can imply maximally all n senses, some of which may only be implicit in the context. In addition, when two systematically polysemous words are used together, the combination enables even more powerful inferences through a complex matching between the two sets of systematic relations. Then, a domain-independent broad-coverage lexicon defined by such abstract underspecified classes can be used as a background lexicon in domain-specific reason-ing tasks such as Information Extraction (Kilgarriff, 1997), or as a general semantic lexicon for parsing, as well as for many other NLP tasks that require contextual inferences.","However, automatic acquisition of systematic polysemy has been a difficult task. In fact, in most previous work in lexical semantics it is done manually (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998). In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method of inducing underspecifled semantic classes from WordNet verbs and nouns. The method first applies a statistical analysis to obtain a rough approximation of the sense dependencies found in WordNet. Incorrect dependencies are then manually filtered out. Although the approach is not fully automated, it provides a principled way of acquiring systematic polysemy from a large-scale lexical resource, and greatly reduces the amount of manual effort that was previously required. Further-more, by having a manual intervention, the results will be able to reflect our prior knowledge about WordNet that was not assumed in the statistical analysis. To see the usefulness of the induced semantic classes in the contextual inferences of real-world texts, predicate-argument structures are extracted from Brown corpus, and the occurrences of such classes are observed. 2 Systematic Polysemy Before presenting the induction method, we first clarify what we consider a systematic polysemy in the work described in this paper, and explain the assumptions we made for such polysemy.","Our systematic polysemy is analogous to logical polysemy in (Pustejovsky, 1995): word senses in which there is no change in lexical category, and the multiple senses of the word have overlapping, dependent, or shared meanings. This definition excludes meanings obtained by cross-categorical alternations (eg. denominals) or morphological alternations (eg. suffixing with -ify), or homonyms or metaphors, and includes only the senses of the word of the same cat-"]},{"title":"109","paragraphs":["egory and form that have some systematic relations. For example, INSTITUTION and BUILDING meanings of the word school are systematically polysemons because BUILDING relates to INSTITUTION by the location of the institution.","For nouns, each polysemous sense often refers to a different object. In the above example, school as INSTITUTION refers to an organization, whereas school as BUILDING refers to a physical object. On the other hand, for verbs, polysemous senses refer to different aspects of the same action. For example, a word write in the sentence \"John wrote the book\" is ambiguous between CREATION (of the book) and COMMUNICATION (through the content of the book) meanings. But they both describe the same action of John writing the particular book. Here, these two meanings are systematically related by referring to the causation aspect (CREATION) or the purpose aspect (COMMUNICATION) of the write action. This view is largely consistent with the entailment relations (temporal inclusion and causation) used to organize WordNet verb taxonomies (Fellbaum, 1990}.","Another assumption we made is the dependency between related senses. In the work in this paper, sense dependency is viewed as sense extension, similar to (Copestake and Briscoe. 1995), in which a primary sense causes the existence of secondary senses. This assumption is in accord with lexical rules (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Ostler and Atkins, 1992), where meaning extension is expressed by if-then implication rules. In the above example of the noun school, INSTITUTION meaning is considered as the primary and BUILDING as the secondary, since institutions are likely to have office space but building may be occupied by other entities besides institutions. Similarly for the verb write, CREATION is considered as the primary and COMMUNICATION as the secondary, since communication takes place through the object that is just produced but communication can take place without producing an object. 3 Induction Method Our induction method is semi-automatic, requiring a manual filtering step between the phased automatic processing. The basic scheme of our method is to first identify the prominent pair-wise cooccurfence between any two basic types (abstract senses), and then build more complex types (underspecifled classes) by the composition of those cooccurfences. But instead of generating/composing all possible types statically, we only maintain the pair-wise relations in a graph representation called type dependency graph, and dynamically form/induce the underspecified classes during the phase when each WordNet entry is assigned the class label(s)."]},{"title":"I I I I","paragraphs":["Based on the definitions and assumptions described in the previous section 2, underspecified semantic classes are induced from WordNet 1.6 (released December 1997) by the following steps:",".

This step is done by two phased analyses: an automatic analysis followed by a manual filtering.",". Generate a set of underspecified semantic classes by partitioning the senses of each word into a set of basic types. Each set becomes an underspecified semantic class. This step is fully automatic. Each step is described in detail below. 3.1 Coarse-grained Basic Types As has been pointed out previously, there are many regularities between polysemous senses, and these regularities seem to hold across words. For ex'ampie, words such as chicken and duck which have ANIMAL sense often have MEAT meaning also (i.e.,"]},{"title":"animal-grinding","paragraphs":["lexical rule (Copestake and Briscoe, 1992)). This generalization holds at an abstract level rather than the word sense level. Therefore,- the first step in the induction is to select a set of abstract senses that are useful in capturing the systematicity. To this end, WordNet is a good resource because word senses (or"]},{"title":"synsets)","paragraphs":["are organized in taxonomies.","Ideally, basic types should be semantically orthogonal, to function essentially as the \"axes\" in a high-dimensional semantic space. Good candidates would be the top abstract nodes in the WordNet taxenemies or lexicographers' file names listed in the sense entries. However, both of them fall short of forming a set of orthogonal axes because of several reasons. First, domain categories are mixed in with ontological categories (eg. co,,petition and"]},{"title":"body","paragraphs":["verb categories). Second, some categories are ontologically more general than others (eg. change category in verbs). Third, particularly for the verbs, senses that seem to take different argument noun types are found under the same category (eg. \"in-gest\" and \"use\" in consumption category). Therefore, some WordNet categories are broken into more specific types.","For the verbs, the following 18 abstract basic types are selected."]},{"title":"110","paragraphs":["ehange(CHA)"]},{"title":"communication(COMM) cognition(COG) competition(COMP) contact(CeNT) motion(MOT) emoeion(ENO) perception(PER)","paragraphs":["possession(POSS) stative(STA)"]},{"title":"~eather(WEA)","paragraphs":["ingestion(ING)"]},{"title":"use(USE) social(SOC) body(BOD) phy_creation(PCR) mental_creation(MCR) verbal_creagion (VCR)","paragraphs":["These are mostly taken from the classifications made by lexicographers.

The premise here is that, if there is a systematic relation between two types, and if the regularity is prominent, it can be captured by the type cooccurrence statistics. In machine learning, several statistical techniques have been developed which discover dependencies among features (or causal structures), such","2Noun top categories in WordNet do not match exactly with lexicographers\" file names, in our experiment, noun types are determined by actually travers-ing the hierarchies, therefore they correspond to the top categories."]},{"title":"I I I I I","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Part of type dependency graph for WordNet verbs"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["as Bayesian network learning (eg. Spirtes et al., 1993). Those techniques use sophisticated methods that take into consideration of multiple an-tecedents/causations and so on, and build a complex and precise model with probabilities associated with edges. In our present work however, WordNet is compiled from human lexicographers' entries, thus the data has a fair amount of arbitrariness (i.e., noisy data). Therefore, we chose a simple technique which yields a simpler network, and used the result as a rough approximation of the type dependencies to be corrected manually at the next phase.","The advantage of this automatic analysis here is two fold: not only it discovers/reveals the semantic type associations with respect to the basic types selected from the previous step, it also helps the manual filtering to become more informed and consistent than by judging with mere intuition, since the result is based on the actual content of WordNet.","The type dependency graph is constructed in the following way. First, for all type-pairs extracted from the ambiguous words in WordNet, mutual information is computed to obtain the association by using the standard formula: for type tl, t2, a mutual information I(tl, t2) is f(ttt̂.-)","l(tl,t2)-lg l(ttlx l(tt) N N where f(t) is the number of occurrence of the type t, and N is the size of the data. The association between two types are considered prominent when the mutual information value was greater than some threshold (in our current implementation, it is 0).","At this point, type associations are undirected because mutual information is symmetric (i.e., commutative). Then, these associations are manually in-spected to create a directed type dependency graph in the next phase. The manual filtering does two things: to filter out the spurious relations (i.e., false positives) and add back the missing ones (i.e., false negatives), and to determine the direction of the correct associations. Detected false positives are mostly homonyms (including metaphors) (eg. 111 WEA-EM0 (weather and emotion) verb type pair for words such as the word ignite). False negatives are mostly the ones that we know exist, but were not significant according to the cooccurrence statistics (eg. ANI-F00D in nouns). As a heuristic to detect the false negatives, we used the cross-categorical inheritance in the taxonomies in which category switches as the hierarchy is traversed up.","The direction of the associations are determined by sense extension described in section 2. In addition, we used \"the ontological generality of the basic types as another criteria. This is because a transitive inference through a ontologically general type may result in a relation where unrelated (specific) types are combined, particularly when the specific types are domain categories. For instance, the verb category Cl~ (change) is ontologically general, and may occur with specific types in entailment relation. But the transitive inference is done through this general type does not necessarily guarantee the systematicity between the associated specific types. In order to prevent this kind of implausible inference, we restricted the direction of a systematic relation to be from the specific type to the general type, if one of the member types is the generalization of the other. Note for some associations which involve equally general/specific types ontologically (such as COG (cognition) and C0MH (co~tmication)), the direction was considered bidirectional (unless sens~ extension strongly suggests the dependency). A part of the type dependency graph for WordNet verbs is shown in Figure 1. 3.3 Underspecified Semantic Classes Underspecified semantic classes are automatically formed by partitioning the ambiguous senses of each word according to the type dependency graph.","Using the type dependency graph, all words in WordNet verb and noun categories are assigned one or more type partitions. A partition is an ordered set of basic types (abstracted from the fine-grained word senses in the first step) keyed by the primary type emcompassing the secondary types. From a list of frequency-ordered senses of a WordNet word, a partition is created by taking one of the three most frequent types (listed as the first three senses in the WordNet entry) as the primary and collecting the secondary types from the remaining list according to the type dependency graph. 3 Here, the secondary types are taken only from the nodes/types that are directly connected to the primary type. That is be-","3The reason we look at the first three senses is because primary types are not always listed as the most frequent sense in the WordNec sense lists (or in actual usage for that matter).

The difficulty is that some combinations do not seem correct collectively.
