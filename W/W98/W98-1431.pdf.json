FLAUBERT is an engine for text generation. Its first applications has been for instructional texts, both in French and in English, in software and aeronautics domains. It is an implementation of G-TAG, a","- formalism for generation inspired from TAG ([Danlos & Meunier 96], [Meunier 97]). This formalism is a lexicalized text generation system ([Danl0s 98a], [Danlos 98b]). All linguistic data are outside of the engine code program. They are maintained directly by linguists under a Simple text editor. The syntactic TAG grammar we use for French is that-written by ([Abeill6 91]). Moreover, the French families of elementary trees are automatically generated thanks to the hierarchical representation of LTAGS ([Candito 96]). The TAG grammar we use for English is home made. This engine runs on Sun Solaris with 32 M• RAM (generator and interface), and is written in Ada 95 (generator) and C (interface). It is compiled by the GNU compilers, and uses GNU Scripts (bash, perl, sed, awk)."]},{"title":"2 Description","paragraphs":["AS in DRAFTER ([Paris et al. 95]), FLAUBERT takes as input a conceptual representation provided by","the user who fills a questionnaire through an interface that proposes cascading menus based on a domain","model (see below). The emphasis is put on linguistic issues such as lexical choices (including choices of","connectives), parallelism issues, stylistic issues (e.g. length and content of clauses and sentences), etc.","FLAUBERT uses three databases: 0 A domain model describing an ontology of concepts in a typed feature formalism. In a","standard way, the concepts include objects, actions, states and relations between them; • A set of lexical data bases associated withconcepts; the lexical database for a given concept","describes its semantico-lexical realizations (lexical heads + argument structures) accompanied","with tests of applicability for right semantics and well formdness; • A TAG grammar whose syntactic informations allow a derived tree to be computed from a","derivation tree (see the data flow below). 3 Data flow","The dataflow of FLAUBERT is given in Figure 1.

It leads to a conceptual representation. Afterwards, the system search in the lexical data bases to make lexical choices and builds a g-derivation tree. During this step, it uses also other linguistic resources (lexical entry as well as syntactic functions) to optimize lexical choices (parallelism, aggregation, etc.). Next the system builds a derived tree (syntactic representation), using standard algorithms ([Schabes & Shieber 94]) and an existing TAG grammar designed for syntactic analysis. Finally, the text is post-processed (flexion, bulding lexicalized tree structure ~-q~ TAG grammar 3.1 User interface post-processing Figure 1: Data flow Figure 2: Cascading menus 285","paragraphs":["Since the user may encounter difficulties to give input to FLAUBERT, we have developed a friendly user interface which proposes him/her to instanciate concepts with cascading menus as it is shown in Figure 2.
