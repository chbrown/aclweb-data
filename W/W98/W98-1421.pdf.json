We utilize an .abstract representation describing, for instance, thematic information and dialogue acts of the dialogue utterances. From this representation we generate simplified paraphrases of the individual turns of the dialogue which together make up the protocol. Instead of writing completely new software, the protocol generation component is almost exclusively composed of already existing modules in the system which are extended by planning and formatting routines for protocol formulations. We describe how the abstract information is extracted from user utterances in different languages and how the abstract thematic representation is used to generate a protocol in one specific language.

A VIT is a semantic representation formalism following the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) of [Kamp and Reyle 1993]. A VIT consists of a set of semantic conditions (i.e. predicates, roles, operators and quantifiers) and allows for under-specifications with respect to scope and subordination or inherent under-specifications. Each discourse individual is formally represented by a discourse referent (also called instance). Information about the individual is encoded by one (or more) VIT-condition(s), combining a predicate with the discourse referent (see section 4).","• Propositional information (currently time expressions) is encoded in a knowledge representation language [Kiissner and Stede 1995]. It is a quite surface-oriented language, but contains some interlingua-like expressions for, e.g., month-of-year (moy), weekdays (dow), time-of-day (rod) and part-of-day(pod). Figure 1 gives some examples, of so-called \"tempexl-expressions \".","The first of February [moy : 2, dora: 1]","Two o'clock in thursday [rod: 14 : 00 ,dow : thu]","Tomorrow between 8 in the morning and 14 hour [dow:tomorrow,","boundaries ( [rod : 08 : 00],","[tod : 03 : 00 ,pod : pm],","from_to) ] Figure 1: Some tempex expressions 2.2 The VERBMOBIL system The VERBMOBIL system is a flexible, speaker independent speech-to-speech translation system for spontaneous speech. To support the robustness of the overall system, the translation process is subdivided into several processing tracks. The most accurat e translation track is a deep linguistic• analysis in combination with semantic transfer and syntactic generation (see figure 2). When this track fails, the translation is performed by other shallow; translation components. In this paper we will just consider the dialogue act based analysis and transfer [Block 1997]. Effects of spontaneous speech like hesitations, corrected and revised utterance parts do not provide any translation- and thereby protocol- relevant information. They have to be recognized and filtered out during the analysis and/or translation process. In figure 2 a sketch of some of the linguistic components is given. The translation process consists of two tracks, the deep and the shallow translation. The deep linguistic translation track, whose modules all exchange linguistic information encoded in VITs, consists of three components: An HPSG-parser combined with a robust semantic component, 1TEMPoral EXpression 199 the semantic based transfer component [Dorna and Emele 1996] and the generation component [Becket et al. 1998], an efficient-multi-lingual generator (some more details below).","The shallow track bases its translation on dialogue acts and the propositional content (currently time expressions).

Moreover, some information is condensed in the protocol","structure (in comparison to the original dialogue contributions) or removed from the protocol","Structure following different criteria of \"protocol relevance\". Example of the latter are utterances","annotated with the dialogue acts e.g. FEEDBACK_ $ or DELIBERATE_* can under most circumstances","be removed.

The use of paraphrases of user utterances in the output language of the protocol emphasizes","that the system has \"understood\" the user contributions. • Furthermore,. by utilizing different sources of information, e.g., deep and shallow processing, we can always generate a protocol. The planning procedure of a protocol formulation depends on whether the original turn segment was given in the output language of the protocol or not. We have to keep in mind that the dialogue partners speak different languages which means that about half of the protocol has to be re-constructed (i.e. condensed and paraphrased) from utterances in the output language of the protocol. The other half of the protocol formulations may consist of utterances which were translated into the output language of the protocol by the system.

Its processing is centered around dialogue acts [Jekat et al. 1995] - it is assumed that every utterance can be attributed one (or more) dialogue acts. important parts of the dialogue module are the sequence memory, which contains data structures for turns and segments (see figur e 3).

The operators are incrementally expanded left to right using a mixed top down and bottom up strategy. A plan operator can be attributed with constraints and actions. The constraints are used to check the relevance of a certain operator in a certain context, whereas the actions are mostly affecting the context. Examples of the latter are: marking an utterance as being protocol relevant or not, or setting the dialogue phase. 4.2 Central Contents of a Turn By determining the central contents we remove unimportant segments and merge segments in such a way that the intended meaning of the turn is preserved. The plan processor performs this operation on two levels: based on •segments and based on turns. By looking at, for instance, the dialogue act, it can be determined whether the segment can be removed or not. More abstract plan operators are responsible for removing whole turns. An example of the latter is clarification sub-dialogues. This, however, turns out to be very difficult when scaling up, due to irregularities in the dialogues and more problematic: recognition errors.

Another example of actions is shown in figure 5. This operator is used for merging two successive utterances of type ACCEPT_DATE into one. This is done when not more than one of the utterances contains propositional contents.

It also determines the turn class; information which we utilize while preparing the VITs, for instance when determining the sentence mood for a segment. For the utterance \"How about at 2 o'clock\" the corresponding information could be the dialogue act SUGGEST._SUPPORT..DATE and the tempex expression [rod:02:00].

The planning of an appropriate protocol formulation for one segment has to consider different cases which require different planning procedures tocome up with a formulation. 5.1 From Tempex-VIT to Protocol Representations The processing proceeds on the semantic level based on the VIT-formalism but now switching to language specific operations. We defined a structured set of VIT-patterns whose task is to insert a verb into the tempex-VIT (which only contains time expressions) and its obligatory verb arguments in order to come up with a complete sentence. This final VIT-representation will then be handed over to the generation module of the VERBMOBIL system for verbalization. The core planning step consists of the selection and application of an appropriate VIT-pattern of a segment which is determined by the following three main criteria:","• The first criterion to find an applicable pattern is the dialogue act of the segment which","means that for all 18 possible dialogue acts •there is a structured list of applicable patterns. *:The second criterion is the sentence mood of the user utterance.","• The third one is the question whether the time expression contained in the tempex-VIT can be assigned directly to a verb argument position or not.

VM-GECO is a highly efficient multi-lingual generation component which consists of a language independent kernel syntactic generator and language specific declarative knowledge sources for syntactic and lexical choices. The last step of our protocol generation module is the formatting of the protocol into an easily understandable and readable format. As the protocol consists of global information about the dialogue itself as well as paraphrased turn segments we chose a protocol format which allows for clear distinction between these parts of the protocol. Furthermore it is important to assign the speaker's name (if it is known) to the protocol formulations of each turn. There are three different formatting devices. The most prominent one is the production of a HTML-format of the protocol. Additionally, I~TEX and ASCII versions are available.","Figure 10 shows an example dialogue and the respective system translations. Figure 11 shows the HTML-format of the protocol 3 of this dialogue.
