The method comprises three steps: determining the lexical chains in a text, building links between the paragraphs of articles, and building links between articles. Lexical chains capture the semantic relations between words that occur throughout a text. Each chain is a set of related words that captures a portion of the cohesive structure of a text. By considering the distribution of chains within an article, we can build links between the paragraphs. By computing the similarity of the chains contained in two different articles, we can decide whether or not to place a link between them. We also describe the results of an evaluation performed to test the methodology."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A survey, reported in Outing (1996), found that there were 1,115 commercial newspaper online services world-wide, 94% of which were on the World-Wide Web (WWW). Of these online newspapers, 73% are in North America. Outing predicted that the number of newspapers online would increase to more than 2,000 by the end of 1997.","The problem is that these services are not making full use of the hypertext capabilities of the WWW. The user may be able to navigate to a particular article in the current edition of an online paper by using hypertext links, but they must then read the entire article to find the information that interests them. These databases are \"shal-low\" hypertexts; the documents that are being retrieved are dead ends in the hypertext, rather than offering start-ing points for explorations. In order to truly reflect the hypertext nature of the Web, links should to be placed within and between the documents.","As Westland (1991) has pointed out, manually creat-ing and maintaining the sets of links needed for a large-scale hypertext is prohibitively expensive. This is especially true for newspapers, given the volume of articles","Work done at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Toronto produced every day. This could certainly account for the state of current WWW newspaper efforts. Aside from the time-and-money aspects of building such large hypertexts manually, humans are inconsistent in assigning hypertext links between the paragraphs of documents (Ellis et al., 1994; Green, 1997). That is, different linkers disagree with each other as to where to insert hypertext links into a document.","The cost and inconsistency of manually constructed hypertexts does not necessarily mean that large-scale hypertexts can never be built. It is well known in the IR community that humans are inconsistent in assigning in-dex terms to documents, but this has not hindered the construction of automatic indexing systems intended to be used for very large collections of documents. Similarly, we can turn to automatically constructed hypertexts to address the issues of cost and inconsistency.","In this paper, we will describe a novel method for building hypertext links within and between newspaper articles. We have selected newspaper articles for two main reasons. First, as we stated above, there is a grow-ing number of services devoted to providing this information in a hypertext environment. Second, many newspaper articles have a standard structure that we can exploit in building hypertext links.","Most of the proposed methods for automatic hypertext construction rely on term repetition. The underlying philosophy of these systems is that texts that are related will tend to use the same terms. Our system is based on lexical chaining and the philosophy that texts that are related will tend to use related terms."]},{"title":"2 Lexical chains","paragraphs":["A lexical chain"]},{"title":"(Morris","paragraphs":["and Hirst, 1991) is a sequence of semantically related words in a text.

The lexical chains contained in a text will tend to delineate the parts of the text that are \"about\" the same thing. Morris and Hirst showed that the organization of the lexical chains in a document mirrors, in some sense, the discourse structure of that document.","The lexical chains in a text can be identified using any lexical resource that relates words by their meaning.

For example, the antonymy relation in WordNet is given a direction of horizontal, since it specializes the sense of a word very accurately, that is, if a word and its antonym appear in a text, the two words are very likely being used in the senses that are antonyms.","Given these types of links, three kinds of relations are built between words:","Extra strong An exwa strong relation is said to exist between repetitions of the same word: i.e., term repetition.","Strong A strong relation is said to exist between words that are in the same WordNet synset (i.e., words that are synonymous).

A path is allowable if it is short (less than n links, where n is typically 3 or 4) and adheres to three rules:","1. No other direction may precede an upward link.","2. No more than one change of direction is allowed.","3. A horizontal link may be used to move from an upward to a downward direction.","When a word is processed during chaining, it is initially associated with all of the synsets of which it is a member. When the word is added to a chain, the chainer attempts to find connections between the synsets associated with the new word and the synsets associated with words that are already in the chain. Synsets that can be connected are retained and all others are discarded. The result of this processing is that, as the chains are built, the words in the chains are progressively sense-disambiguated. When an article has been chained, a description of the chains contained in the document is written to a file. Table 1 shows some of the chains that were recovered from an article about the trend towards \"virtual parenting\" (Shellenbarger, 1995). In this table, the numbers in parentheses show the number of occurrences of a particular word.","The process of lexical chaining is not perfect, but if we wish to process articles quickly, then we must accept some errors or at least bad decisions. In our sample article, for example, chain 1 is a conglomeration of words that would have better been separated into different chains. This is a side effect of the current implementation of the lexical chainer, but even with these difficulties, we are able to perform useful tasks. We expect to address some of these problems in subsequent versions of the chainer, hopefully with no loss in efficiency. 3 Building links within an article 3.1 Analyzing the iexicai chains Newspaper articles are written so that one may stop read-ing at the end of any paragraph and feel as though one has read a complete unit. For this reason, it is natural to choose to use paragraphs as the nodes in our hypertext. Table 1 showed the lexical chains recovered from a news article about the trend towards \"virtual parenting\". Figure 1 shows the second and eighth paragraphs of this article with the words that participate in lexical chains tagged with their chain numbers. We will use this particular article to illustrate the process of building intra-article links.","The first step in the process is to determine how important each chain is to each paragraph in an article.

So, in this case the density of chain 1 in paragraph I, dr,z, is 9 4-g = 0.19.","The result of these calculations is that each paragraph in the article has associated with it a vector of chain densities, with an element for each of the chains in the article.

Note that an empty element indicates a density of 0. 3.2 Determining paragraph links As we said earlier, the parts of a document that are about the same thing, and therefore related, will tend to contain the same lexical chains. Given the chain density vectors that we described above, we need to develop a method to determine the similarity of the sets of chains contained in each paragraph. The second stage of paragraph linking, therefore, is to compute the similarity between the paragraphs of the article by computing the similarity between the chain density vectors representing them. We can compute these similarities using any one of 16 similarity coefficients that we have taken from Ellis et al. (1994).","This similarity is computed for each pair of chain density vectors, giving us a symmetric p x p matrix of similaritie s, where p is the number of paragraphs in the article. From this matrix we can calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the paragraph similarities.","The next step is to decide which paragraphs should be linked, on the basis of the similarities computed in the previous step.

In the current system, there are two ways to output the HTML representation of an article. The first simply displays all of the links that were computed during the last stage of the process described above. The second is more complicated, showing only some of the links. The idea is that links between physically adjacent paragraphs should be omitted so that they do not clutter the hypertext."]},{"title":"4 Building links between articles","paragraphs":["While it is useful to be able to build links within articles, for a large scale hypertext, links also need to be placed between articles. You will recall from section 2 that the output of the lexical chainer is a list of chains, each chain consisting of one or more words. Each word in a chain has associated with it one or more synsets. These synsets indicate the sense of the word as it is being used in this chain. An example of the kind of output produced by the ehainer is shown in table 4, which shows a portion of the chains extracted from an article (Gadd, 1995b) about cuts in staffat children's aid societies due to a reduction in provincial grants. Table 5 shows a portion of another set of chains, this time from an article (Gadd, 1995a) describing the changes in child-protection agencies, due in part to budget cuts.","It seems quite clear that these two articles are related, and that we would like to place a link from one to the other. It is also clear that the words in these two articles display both of the linguistic factors that affect IR performance, namely synonymy and polysemy. For example, the first set of chains contains the word abuse, while the second set contains the synonym maltreatment. Similarly, the first set of chains includes the word kid, while the second contains child. The word abuse in the first article has been disambiguated by the lexieal chainer into the \"cruel or inhuman treatment\" sense, as has the word maltreatment from the second article. We once again note that the lexieal chaining process is not perfect: for example, both texts contain the word abuse, but it has been d.isambiguated into different senses-- in the first article, it is meant in the sense of \"ill-treatment\", while in the second it is meant in the sense of \"verbal abuse\".","Although the articles share a large number of words, by missing the synonyms or by making incorrect (or no) judgments about different senses, a traditional IR system might miss the relation between these documents or rank them as less related than they really are. Aside from the problems of synonymy and polysemy, we can see that there are also more-distant relations between the words of these two articles.

Given an article that we wish to build links from, we can compute the similarity between the article's symet weight vectors and the vectors of all other documents. Documents whose member vectors exceed a given threshold of similarity will have a link placed between them. Our preliminary work shows that a threshold of 0.15 will include most related documents while excluding many unrelated documents.","This is almost exactly the methodology used in vector-space IR systems such as SMART, with the difference being that for each pair of documents we are calculating three separate similarity measures. The best way to cope with these multiple measurements seems to be to rank related documents by the sum of the three similarities. The sum of the three similarities can lie, theoretically, anywhere between 0 and 3. In practice, the sum is usually less than 1.

The obvious way to answer the question was to test whether the links generated by our methodology lead to better performance when they were used in the context of an appropriate IR task.","We selected a question-answering task for our study. We made this choice because it appears that this kind of task is well suited to the browsing methodology that hypertext links are meant to support. This kind of task is also useful because it can be performed easily using only hypertext browsing. This is necessary because in the interface used for our experiment, no query engine was provided for the subjects.","We used the \"Narrative\" section of three TREC topics (Harman, 1994) to build three questions for our subjects to answer. There were approximately 1996 documents that were relevant to the topics from which these questions were created. We read these documents and prepared lists of answers for the questions. Our test database consisted of these articles combined randomly with approximately 29,000 other articles selected randomly from the TREC corpus. The combination of these articles provided us with a database that was large enough for a reasonable evaluation and yet small enough to be easily manageable. 5.1 The test system We considered two possible methods for generating inter-article hypertext links. The first is our own method, described above. The second method uses a vector space IR system called Managing Gigabytes (MG) (Witten et al., 1994) to generate links by calculating a document similaxity that is based strictly on term repetition. We used the MG system to generate links in a way very similar to that presented in Allan (1995). For simplicity's sake, we will call the links generated by our technique HT links and the links generated by the MG system MG links.","Figure 2 shows the interface of the test system used. The main part of the screen showed the text of a single article. The subjects could navigate through the article by using the intra-article links, a scroll bar, or the page up and down keys. The Previous Article and Next Article buttons could be used for navigating through the set of articles that had been visited and the Back button returned the user to the point from which an intra-article link was taken. Each search began on a \"starter\" page that conmined the text of the appropriate TREC topic as the \"article\" and the list of articles related to the topic shown (this was computed by using the text of the topic as the initial \"query\" to the database). Subjects were expected to traverse the links, writing down whatever answers they could find.","At each stage during a subject's browsing, a set of inter-article links was generated by combining the set of I-IT links and the set of MG links.

We can, however, determine which system they \"voted\" for by considering their success in answering the questions they were asked. If we can show that their success was greater when they followed more I-IT links, then we can say that they have \"voted\" for the superiority of HT links. A similar methodology has been used previously by Nordhausen et al. (1991) in their comparison of human and machine-generated hypertext links.","The two sets of inter-article links can be combined by simply taking the"]},{"title":"unique","paragraphs":["links from each set, that is, the links that we take are those that appear in only one of the sets of links. Of Course, we would expect the two methods to have many links in common, but it is difficult to tell how these links should be counted in the \"vot-ing\" procedure. By leaving them out, we test the differences between the methods rather than their similarities. Of course, by excluding the links that the methods agree on we are reducing the ability of the subjects to find answers to the questions that we have posed for them. In fact, we found that nearly 40% of the links found were found by both methods. It does seem, however, that the users could find enough answers to give some interesting results. 5.2 Experimental results The number of both inter- and intra-articte links followed was, on average, quite small and variable (full data are given in Green, 1997). The number of correct answers found was also low and variable, which we believe is due partly to the methodology and partly to the time restrictions placed on the searches (15 minutes). On average, the subjects showed a slight bias for HT links, choosing 47.9% MG links and 52.1% HT links. This is interesting, especially in light of the fact that, for all the articles the subjects visited, 50.4% of the links available were MG links, while 49.6% were HT links.

An interesting question to ask is: did subjects with significantly higher values for LR find more answers? With 23 subjects each answering 3 questions, we have 69 values for LR.

We can explore this relationship using two different regression analyses, one incorporating only inter-article links and another incorporating both inter-and intra-article links. These analyses will express the relationship between the number of links followed and the number of correct answers found. 5.2.1 Inter-article links","A model incorporating only the inter-article links that our subjects followed gives us the following equation:"]},{"title":"Green","paragraphs":["107"]},{"title":"Automatically generating hypertext II II il II II II II II II II II II II II II II","paragraphs":["16 14 12 10 8 6","I I","I A","--","t","44","A","• 4","•","--","• AA","4.","4&A","~","A","••","•","4 A","•","0 \"'|\" I , 0 1 2 I I I , Data","Aria = 3.65 + 0.56- LR / J I I I I 3 4 5 6","LR Figure 3: Data and regression line for a two-dimensional model. we can see a set of subjects (the High Web group) who found significantly more answers"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["followed significantly more I-IT links, indicating the advantage of HT links over MG links. 5.2.4 Viewed answers","In the analyses that we've performed to this point, we have been using the number of correct answers that the subjects provided as our dependent variable.

Furthermore, we determined that the probability of obtaining results such as these by chance is less than 0.1. Our in-ability to achieve a significant result may be due to several implementation factors, described in Green (1997). Thus, we conclude that we need to replicate the experiment in order to gain further information about the relationship between the two kinds of inter-article links."]},{"title":"Green","paragraphs":["109"]},{"title":"Automatically generating hypertext","paragraphs":[]}]}
