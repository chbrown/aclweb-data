A lot of such resources, including both software and lingware items (lexicons, lexical databases, grammars, corpora marked in several ways) have been made available for research and industrial applications.","Special interest presents, for knowledge-based NLP tasks, the availability of wide coverage ontologies. Most known ontologies (as GUM, CYC, ONTOS, MICROKOSMOS, EDR or WORDNET, see [Gomez 98] for an extensive survey) defer in great extent on several characteristics (e.g. broad coverage vs. domain specific, lexicaUy oriented vs. conceptually oriented, granularity, kind of information placed in nodes, kind of relations, way of building, etc.). It is clear, however, that for a wide range of applications, WordNet (WN) [Miller 90] as become a de-facto standard.","The success of WordNet has determined the emergence of several projects that aim the construction of WordNets for other languages than English (e.g., [Hamp & Feldweg 97], [Artale et al. 97]) or to develop multilingual WordNets (the most important project in this line is EuroWordNet (EWN)I)."]},{"title":"lhttp://www.let.uva.rd/~ewn/The","paragraphs":["aim of EWN vroject is to braid a multi.lingual database with WordN'ets for several european languages (in the first phase, Dutch, Italian and Spanish in addltion to English).","The construction of a WN for a language Lg (LgWN) can be tackled in different ways according to the lexical sources available. Of course the manual construction can be undertaken quite straightforwardly and leads to the best results in terms of accuracy, but has the important drawback of its cost. So, other approaches have been carried out taking profit of available resources in fully automatic or semi-automatic ways.","Which are these lexical resources? Basically four kinds of resources have been used: 1) English WN (EnWN0, as an initial skeleton for trying to attach the words of Lg to it, 2) already existing taxonomies of Lg (both at word and at sense level), 3) bilingual (English and Lg) and 4) monolingual (Lg) dictionaries. All the approaches using EnWN as skeleton are based on the assumption of a close conceptual similarity between English and Lg, in such a way that most of the structure (relations) in EnWN could be maintained for LgWN.","In the case of bilingual dictionaries the usual approach is to try to link the English counterpart of entries to synsets in EnWN and to assume that the entry can be ]inked to the same synset.","Monolingual dictionaries have been used basically as a source for extracting taxonomic (hypemym) links between words (or senses [Bruce & Guthrie 92], [Rigau et al. 97]) and in lower extent for extracting other kinds of semantic relations [Richardson 97] (e.g. meronymic links).","Once a taxonomy of Lg (already existing or built from a monolingual MILD) is available, the task can consist of 1) enriching the taxonomic structure with other semantic links (manually or automatically), as is the case of building individual WNs, or 2) merging this structure with other already existing ontologies (as EnWN or EWN).","This paper presents our approach to the construction of WNs for two languages, Spanish and Catalan, and linking the first one to EWN. We have developed a methodology that uses as core source EnWN 2. The methodology implies 1)","2We have used WordNet 1.5. 65"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I !

Sections 3, 4 and 5 focus on the procedures for extracting connections between words/senses/synsets. Section 3 is devoted to procedures based on the use of bilinguals, section 4 on the construction of taxonomies and section 5 deals with the merging method.

As we are involved in EWN project (covering the Spanish part), the methodology has been defined to be compatible which the general approach, guidelines and landmarks of the whole project but also to allow a parallel development of the CtWN.","The general approach for building EWN is described in [Vossen et al. 97]. Roughly speaking, the approach follows a top-down strategy trying to assure a high level of overlapping between languages, at least in the highest levels of the hierarchy, but reflecting the language-specific lexicalizations and providing the maximum of freedom and flexibility for building the individual WordNets. Basically it consists of three major steps: l) Construction of core-WordNets for a set of common base concepts (around 800 nouns and 200 verbs), 2) enrichment of these sets providing relational links and incorporating their direct semantic contexts and 3) top-down extension of these core-WordNets.","In our case two different approaches have been followed for dealing with nouns and verbs 3. 3Although other categories can be included in EWN (and cross-category relations an be established) only nouns and verbs have been introduced until now in our WordNets except for demostration purposes. In the case of verbs most of the work has been","performed manually. The main source of","information has been the Pirapides database","[Castell6n et al. 97] that consists of 3,600 English","verbs forms organized around Levin's Semantic","Classes connected to WN1.5 senses. The database","contains the theta-Grids specifications for each","verb (its semantic structure in terms of cases or","thematic roles), translation to Spanish and","Catalan forms 4 and diathesis information. The","connections extracted from this database were","cross-validated with the information provided by","bilingual dictionaries in order to improve their","accuracy. In the case of nouns we have followed EWN","strategy in the next way: 1) The two highest levels of EnWN (top","concepts and direct hyponyms) were manually","translated into Spanish (including variants). The","results were filtered dropping out words","appearing less than five times as genus terms in","our monolingual dictionary [DGILE 87] or occurring","less than 50 times in DGILE definition corpus 5 and","less than 100 times in LEXESP corpus 6. This initial set (Spanish core concepts, 361","synsets) was then compared with base concept sets","of other sites of EWN (roughly the union of","intersection pairs between languages was","considered as the common base concepts set). The","missing concepts in Spanish were manually added","and vertically bottom up extended leading to the","common Base Concept set (around 800 synsets).","Catalan Base Concepts set was then built to cover","the Spanish Base Concepts set. 2) The enrichment of the BC set has been","performed in two steps.

We have therefore assumed that the","structure of the WN taxonomy would suffice in the","earlier stages of the construction of the our WNs. So, we need to choose synonyms in Spanish 7 for","the English words present in the original synsets","of WN. One way to fulfil our requirements is using","bilingual dictionaries (see [Knight & Luk 94],","[Okumura & Hovy 94]). But we have to perform a","sense disambiguation task in order to know which","sense of both words (the Spanish and the English","one) is being referred. In other words, we have to","decide, for which sense of the Spanish word and","for which synset in WordNet a relation of","synonymy is being defined. There is also another minor problem to","overcome, the unification of the two directions of","the bilingual dictionary, which in few cases are","symmetrical, to collect all translations together.","It is true that unifying both directions of the","bilingual dictionary implies loss of information","potentially important (e.g. the order in which","translations are written is relevant). But the lack","of systematic work in the construction of the","bilinguals makes this information of very doubtful","utility. Thus, we have processed the bilinguals","creating what we have called the homogeneous","bilingual, which is a bilingual with both","directions mixed. Then, for each Spanish word, we","have collected all the words given as correct","translations. And this has been the source for our","work of attachment of Spanish words to WordNet","synsets. Having collected all the translations of a","Spanish word together, we have then classified","the words in classes depending on their behaviour.","They can be classified in three dimensions:","polysemy, structural and conceptual. In the polysemy dimension, we classify the","words in classes depending on the number and kind","of translations. For example, all entries that have","only one translation fall in the same class when","this translation is monosemous in WN terms; all","entries that have several translations fall in","another class when these translations are","polysemous. 7Although we ilustrate the methodology considering only Spanish, we performed the whole process for both Catalan and Spanish (and we provide results for both).","In the structural dimension, we classify the words in classes depending on the relation that the translations owns in WN. For example, all entries which have several translations, sharing some of them a common synset in WN, fall in the same category; all entries in which one translation is a direct hyponym of other translation fall in the same category, etc.","In the conceptual dimension, we apply the conceptual distance formula (which is explained in section 4.2.1.) on elements of the entries. For example, all entries with a low conceptual distance between synsets of their translations fall in the same class.","Each of these classes defines a set of entries with the same behaviour. A confidence score has been assigned to each class by means of a manual validation of a significant sample extracted from them. We decided to accept the classes with a precission of 85% or more as classes of words to include in the first version of SpWN.","Bilinguals can be used a step further stating a supposition: when several methods give the same result for the same Spanish word, the confidence for this attachment increases. We have carried out an experiment checking the classes in pairs, evaluating the precission of the set of intersections, and in all cases the precission increased. We have removed the cases where the precision was over 85%, the threshold applied in the previous experiment. This caused an increment of 40% of the original set of attachments.","Furthermore, it is clear that if we merge more bilinguals, the homogeneous resulting will be larger, and will then generate larger classes. But, what is even more important, the classes are more precise because some bilinguals lack the inclusion of some translations for some words.

That is, 1) parsing each • definition for obtaining the genus, 2) performing a genus disambiguation procedure, and 3) building a natural classification of the concepts as a concept taxonomy with several tops. Following this purely descriptive methodology, the semantic primitives of the LgWN could be obtained by collecting those dictionary senses appearing at the top of the complete taxonomies derived from the dictionary. By characterizing each of these tops, the complete LgWN could be produced. For DGILE, the complete noun taxonomy was derived using the automatic method described by [Rigau et"]},{"title":"al. 97]8.","paragraphs":["However, several problems arise due to a) the source (i.e., circularity, errors, inconsistencies, omitted genus, etc.) and b) the limitation of the genus sense disambiguation techniques applied (i.e., [Bruce et al. 92] report 80% accuracy using automatic techniques, while [Rigau et al. 97] report 83%). Furthermore, the top dictionary senses do not usually represent the semantic subsets that the LgWN needs to characterize in order to represent useful knowledge for NLP systems. In other words, there is a mismatch between the knowledge directly derived from an MRD and the knowledge needed by a LgWN.","To illustrate the problem we are facing, let us suppose we plan to place the FOOD concepts in the LgWN. Neither collecting the taxonomies derived from a top dictionary sense (or selecting a 8This taxonomy contains 111,624 dictionary senses and has only 832 dictionary senses which are tops of the taxonomy (these top dictionary senses have no hypernyms), and 89,458 leaves (which have no hyponyms).

The first are too general (they would cover non-FOOD concepts) and the second are too specific (they would not cover all FOOD dictionary senses because FOODs are described in many ways).","All these problems can be solved using a mixed methodology. That is, by attaching selected top concepts (and its derived taxonomies) to prescribed semantic primitives represented in the LgWN. Thus, first, we prescribe a minimal ontology (represented by the semantic primitives of the LgWN) able to represent the whole lexicon derived from the MRD, and second, following a descriptive approach, we collect, for every semantic primitive placed in the LgWN, its subtaxonomies. Finally, those subtaxonomies selected for a semantic primitive are attached to the corresponding LgWN semantic category.","We used as semantic primitives the 24 lexicographer's files (or semantic files) into which the 60,557 noun synsets (87,641 nouns) of WN are classified 9. Thus, we considered the 24 semantic tags of WN as the main LgWN semantic primitives to which all dictionary senses must be attached. In order to overcome the language gap we also used a bilingual Spanish/English dictionary. 4.2 Attaching DGILE dictionary senses to semantic primitives","In order to classify all nominal DGILE senses with respect to WordNet semantic files, we used a similar approach to that suggested by [Yarowsky 92]. This task is divided into three fully automatic consecutive subtasks. First, we tag a subset (due to the difference in size between the monolingual and the bilingual dictionaries) of DGILE dictionary senses by means of a process that uses the conceptual distance formula (see 4.2.1); second, we collect salient words for each semantic file; and third, we enrich each DGILE 9One could use other semantic classifications, such as Roget's Thesaurus [Yarowsky 92], the LDOCE semantic or pracmatic codes [Slator 91] or even better, a Spanish semantic classification such as the \"Diccionario IdeolOgico de la Lengua Espafiola J. Casares'\" (DILEC). Really; when using this methodology a minimal set of informed seeds are needed. These seeds can be collected from MRDs, thesauri or even by introspection.
