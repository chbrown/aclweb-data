To concentrate on the text generation rather than text planning, we assume that the lexicalized semantic description of the text is produced in some way, currently given by hand. In the generation, we need a linguistic theory to describe the linguistic resources, and also a software tool to perform them in a computational environment. We use a functional linguistic theory called Systemic-Functional Grammar (SFG) to represent the linguistic resources, and FUF text generation system as a software tool to perform them. In this paper, we present the systemic-functional representation and realization of simple Turkish sentences. 1 Introduction Natural language generation is a kind of process that encodes the mental picture of reality into a sequence of words called grammatical units such as clause, verbal group, noun group etc. The units of a grammar can be ordered in terms of a rank scale, from the largest to the smallest unit (structural classification) (Halliday, 1985): a sentence consists of one or more clauses; a clause consists of one or more phrases (groups); a phrase consists of one or more words; a word consists of a root word, and zero or more morphemes; a morpheme is the smallest unit.","A simple sentence consists of only one main protess and several components that complement or modify the main process. Each component may be realized by complex syntactic structures but it does not change the simple structure of the sentence. In other words, the number of words in a sentence does not determine whether the sentence is simple or not. The main property of the simple sentence is that each component in the sentence has a function that is determined by the main process such as actor,","*This work was supported by NATO Science for stability Project Grant TU-LANGUAGE. goal, time, manner, etc. A complex sentence consists of more than one simple sentence that may be structurally or semantically connected to each other. Because the generation of simple sentences must be achieved before the generation of complex sentences, we concentrate on the generation of simple sentences in this paper.","We analyze simple Turkish sentences from the systemic-functional perspective to determine their structural and functional descriptions (Patten, 1988). By using these descriptions, we have constructed the system network of simple sentences and we have implemented a sentence generator in Functional Unification Formalism (FUF) (Elhadad, 1990-2) to perform the linguistic resources. In our analysis, we determine the main process, participants and circumstantials of a simple sentence, and how they are realized in Turkish.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider the grammatical analysis of the simple sentence. We present the functional analysis of simple sentences, which determines participants and their realizations in Turkish. We paid a special attention to the verbal group part of sentences which is used in the realization of the process. Section 3 gives a brief overview of the systemic-functional grammar approach to text generation, and particularly presents the system network of the simple sentence. Next, in Section 4, the implementation of a Turkish sentence generator is introduced, and then the generation of simple sentences is demonstrated. Finally, Section 5 presents conclusion and future work.","2 Grammatical Analysis of Simple Sentences 2.1 Predicate Types of Sentences Turkish sentences can be divided into two groups depending on the type of their predicates: verbal and nominal sentences. If the predicate of the sentence is derived from a verb, it is called a verbal sentence.

NeMLaPS/CoNLL98: New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, ACL, pp 165-173. If the predicate is derived from a nominal I group, it is called a nominal sentence.","In verbal sentences, a verb is used as a base of a verbal group, other information such as time, mode, person is realized as suffixes to this base. The following is an example for a Turkish verbal sentence.","(1) Yarm okul-a gid-ece~-iz. Tomorrow schooI+DAT gO+FUT+IPL 'We will go to school tomorrow.'","In positive nominal sentences, a nominal group becomes a finite verb with a substantive verb which is used as an auxiliary verb to demonstrate \"to be\" meaning of the predicate in four grammatical tenses: present, past, narrative and conditional.","(2) a. Ahmet balkan-din Ahmet chairman+coP. 'Ahmet is the chairman.'","b. Klz ~ok giizel-di. Girl very beautiful+PAST 'The girl was very beautiful.' The negative sense of the nominal sentence is represented by a separate negative word de~£1 (not to be) for the tenses mentioned above. (3) Ahmet balkan de~il-dir.","Ahmet chairman NegNoun+coP.","'Ahmet is not the chairman.' The other tenses in the nominal sentences are expressed by the auxiliary verb ol (be). In this case, the auxiliary verb is realized the same way as the predicate of a verbal sentence.","(4) Yarm okul-da ol-ma-yaca~-lm.

In this section, we consider the realization of each semantic function in Turkish.","A clause 2 (simple sentence) consists of three functional components: process, participants, and circumstantials. Process is the main constituent that represents an event or a state. Participants are persons or things involved in a process. Circums~antials are the optional constituents to describe the process from different perspective such as time, place, manner etc.","Participants and circumstantials are specified with new semantic functions to represent the special a Nominal is' a common name for nouns and adjectives 2Clause is used as a common name for sentences or","sentence-like structures. meanings, roles or relations in the clause. The specific participant functions depend on the type of process. The transitivity and ergativity analysises (Halliday, 1985) allow us to classify the processes in the language, and to describe the configuration of participants. The specific circumstantial functions do not strictly depend on the type of the process, and they are optionally used to give more information about the process. 2.2.1 Transivity Analysis","Transitivity analysis specifies the different types of processes recognized in the language, and determines the participants depending on these types. In this way, the logical relationships between the process and participants are provided. The types of processes and their special participants may be classifted as follows. 1.Material processes express the notion that some entity \"does\" something which may be done \"to\" some other entity. Material processes contain actor as an obligatory participant that represents the one that does the deed, and goal as an optional participant that represents the one that the process is extended to. Material processes are realized by verbal sentences in Turkish. 2.Mental processes express feeling, thinking, and perceiving activities of humans. There are two participants in a mental process: senser who is the conscious being that senses, and phenomenon that is a thing or a fact which is sensed. Mental processes are also realized by verbal sentences in Turkish. 3.Relational processes express the way of \"being\". Relational processes can be classified according to the type of \"being\", and the explanation mode of \"being\". The type of \"being\" can be intensive, circumstantial and possessive. Each type can be explained in two modes: attributive and identifying. As a result, the six types of relational processes can OCCUr. The special participants for relational processes are determined depending on the mode of \"being\". In the attributive mode, there are two participants: carrier that is an entity to that an attribute is as-c.ribed, and attribute is a determiner that is ascribed to carrier. The participant identifier is used to identify the participant identified in the identifying mode. In Turkish, relational processes are realized by nominal sentences. In other words, the process of being is expressed by a substantive verb or a distinct auxiliary verb ol (be) depending on the time of the sentence. The attribute is conflated with the process of the sentence in the attributive mode, and the identifier is conflated with the process in the identifying mode. Thus, these two participants are used as nominal bases of verbal groups in the re-Cicekli and Korlanaz 166 Generation of Simple Turkish Sentences"]},{"title":"II II II II II II II II II II II II II II II II II il II II II","paragraphs":["alization of the process. However, in the attributive mode of the possessive relation, a distinct word sahip (have) is used as the nominal base in the reaiization of the process, and the attribute is realized as a noun phrase in the dative case. 4.Existential processes express that something exists or happens. There is only one participant: entity. To express that entity exists or not, two distinct nouns vax (exist) and yok (absent) are respectively used in Turkish. Thus, existential processes are also realized as nominal sentences, and these distinct nouns are used as nominal bases in the realization of the process. 2.2.2 Ergativity Analysis","If the process is \"caused\"-ergative, the analysis of the ergativity is required to find the functions agent (causer) and medium (affected) as participants of the process. Sometimes medium is conflated with actor, and sometimes with goal. In addition, the agent and the actor may be different participants to explain the fact that someone (agent) is causing someone else (actor) to perform the process. For instance, in (5), All (the agent) caused Veli (the actor) to paint the table. (5) Ali masa-yl Veli-'ye boya-t-tl.","All table+AcC Veli+DAw paint+caus+PASW","'Ali had Veli paint the table.' In Turkish, the causation hierarchy may be more complex. More than one agent-like participants may appear between the agent and the actor to explain that someone is causing another causing another and so on to perform the process. For example, an additional participant agent-2 is illustrated in (6).

We do not consider more complex causations, because they are not frequently used in practice. 2.2.3 Realization of Participants and","Cireumstantials","Participants are mapped onto syntactic functions such as subjed, direct-object, indirect-object, etc. Participants are realized by noun groups and infinitive clauses in Turkish and their case markings depend on their syntactic roles in the sentence.","In contrast to participants, circumstantials are not mapped onto any syntactic functions, and they are directly realized by noun groups, post-positional groups or adverbs in the sentence structure.

Since Turkish is a free word order language, the syntactic functions in the sentence can be freely ordered to construct the sentence. Although the constituents can be freely ordered, each order provides the additional information to explain the different textual functions of each constituent. The textual functions can be identified as follows (Erguvanh, 1979; Hoffman, 1995):","• the sentence-initial position as topic ..","• the immediately preverbal position as focus","• the postverbal position as background informa-","tion In the realization, each constituent may be conflated with one of these functions, and these functions are strictly ordered as shown in the following template4: Topic ...

A verbal group is constructed on a lexical element called base that can be a verb or a nominal group. The base is the single lexical element that is given for the formation of a verbal group. The other lexical elements (such as de~£1 (neg. noun), m:i. (question), ol (be)), the relevant suffixes and the components of the verbal group are determined and organized by the systemic-functional grammar designed for Turkish to express appropriate meanings. This section presents the possible structures of verbal groups and their internal organization in Turkish (Banguo~lu, 1986; Ko~, 1990).","There are more than one grammatical structure of verbal groups to express many distinct meanings. Fortunately, they may be generalized according to the type of base (nominal group, verb) and the mood (finite, non-finite). The selected features from these two systems (type-of-base and mood) determine the appropriate structure for the verbal group. The selected features from other systems in Figure 1.b (given in Section 3) organize the internal structure of the verbal group. As a result, the following four general structures can occur: 1. base is a verb and mood is finite: This case is selected to realize the pro. cess of a verbal sentence, or question. The.type of the process can be material or mental. The structure of verbal groups in this case is shown in Table 2 for the following examples in (8). 5 There exist two distinct components","SThe structures are considered in the tabular forms. The center row of the table describes the required functional elements of the verbal group in a grammatical order. The top rows of the table give examples, and bottom rows present their grammatical values, respectively. M-P-N stands for Mode, Person, and Number; VF stands for Voice Frame; POL stands for Polarity; DV stands for Descriptive Verb; DP stands for Descriptive Polarity. of the verbal group for interrogative sentences (questions): base and interrogative tag. The mode, person, and number are added to base or interrogative tag depending on the selected values of these functions. (8) a.

Here, the base is a nominal group that may be an attribute or an identifier in a nominal sentence or question. The type of \"being\" may be intensive, circumstantial, or possessive. According to its type, the base may take some suffixes such as locative and possessive before the formation of the verbal group. In the generation of a verbal group, we assume that the base is a lexical element, and the required suffixes or the distinct elements are determined by the systemic grammar to express the Ciceldi and Korbnaz 168 Generation of Simple Turkish Sentences"]},{"title":"I I I I I I m","paragraphs":["The head noun can be a common noun, a proper noun, or a pronpun. According to this choice, the head noun is modified by different grammatical functions that may be interpreted as the constituents of the NP. The general grammatical functions that expand the head noun can be: determiner which indicates whether a subset of the head noun is specific or not, and expresses the numerical features of the head noun; describer which indicates the subjective and objective properties of the head noun; classifier which indicates a particular subclass of the head noun; qualifiers which indicate the characteristics of the head noun in terms of some process in which the head noun is directly or indirectly involved as a participant. Qualifiers may be realized by a participle clause. These grammatical functions can be divided into more specific sub-functions. The order of these functions in a Turkish noun group is determined by partial orders among them in the implementation. Although the details of the noun groups in Turkish are not given here, the noun groups are fully implemented in our system. 2.5 Post-Positional Group (PP) Post-positional group (PP) has a simple structure that consists of an NP or infinitive, and a postposi-tion particle in Turkish. Participles are closed class of words such as gSre (according to), do~-u (to-wards), sonra (after) etc. A particle cannot refer to any concept but it constructs a relationship between the NP and the other constituents. Each particle may enforce the NP in a particular case. 2.6 Adverb Group (AdvG) Adverb group (AdvG) is used in the realization of several circumstantial functions given in Section 2.2.3. The main constituent of an adverb group is head which is an adverb that gives information about when, how, where, or in which circumstances something happens. In an adverb group, there may be additional modifiers to modify the head adverb.","3 System Network of Simple Sentence A system network is a set of systems such that each system is described as \"a set of linguistic choices in a specific linguistic context\" by Firth (Patten, 1988). In addition, the system network displays the graphical organization of the grammar. In the generation with SFG, the system network (shown in Figure 1) is traversed from left to right by selecting a feature from each system, and executing the realization rules attached to this feature (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991; Patten, 1988). If the selected feature has a function that is realized by one of the grammatical units in the rank scale, the systemic network is re-entered, and recursively traversed for the generation of that unit. After traversing the entire systern network, generations of the grammatical units are completed. In this way, the whole sentence that consists of these grammatical units is generated. In Figure 1.a, if we select the simple clause feature from the rank system, we enter five more systems: process, transivity, mood, voice and circums~antials. After selecting proper features from these systems, SFG introduces the process as a function of the clause, and then realizes it as a verbal group by re-entering the network. The selection of a feature from each system, and the representation of realization rules depend on the implementation formalism. These is-sues are considered in Section 4.","The required systems, the realization rules, and the appropriate context of each system in the linguistic description of the simple sentence are determined and organized by using the analysis described in the previous section. As a result, the system network given in Figure 1 is constructed. In the network, only systems and their appropriate contexts are displayed to express the basic linguistic description of simple sentences. Because of this simplification, more specific rules and relations are not displayed in the network. However, they are considered and handled in the implementation.","To generate a simple sentence, the system network is traversed by using the algorithm given above. For example, to produce the simple sentence axkada§laz':lax:t sevebilmelisin given in (8.a), after the appropriate features are selected, we re-enter the system network to realize the process by a verbal group and to realize the phenomenon by a noun group. When the system network is re-entered to realize the process the following systems are entered and the appropriate features are selected in Figure 1.b: Enter type-of-base, select verb; enter mood, select finite; enter polarity, select positive; enter desc-verb, select potential; enter interrogative, select none. According to these selected features, the other systems are entered and so on. At the end, the system FINIT~-VG-I~0H-VF2~ is entered to realize the verbal group by using the given structure in Table 2. 4 Implementation In order to develop a text generator with the systemic-functional grammar, we need to implement the linguistic descriptions (system networks and realization rules) in a computational environment. For this purpose, we use the FUF text generation system(Elhadad, 1993) including its functional unification grammar (FUG) and typed feature formalisms. In this section, we present a brief overview of the generation in FUF, and then, we particularly consider t-he generation of simple sentences.","The FUF text generation system consists of two main modules: a unifier and a linearizer (Elhadad, 1990-2).

After the unification process, the lineariser takes the generated syntactic description as input, and then produces the morphological description of the text. The morphology unit produces the worded text by using this morphological description (Oflazer, 1993). We assume that an application program that is not included in our implementation produces the lezicalized semantic description of the text. Consequently, the final text generation system can be organized as shown in Figure 2.","In FUG framework, a data structure called functional description (FD) is handled. A FD is a list of pairs. Each pair has an attribute name and value. Since we use the FUG formalism in our implementation, we need to translate the system network into this formalism. A system in the system network can be translated into disjunction of FDs, where each FD corresponds to an alternative in that system (Korkmaz, 1996; Kasper, 1988; Kumano et al., 1994). Realization rules and relations between systems are also translated into attribute-value pairs. This process is described by Kasper as an algorithm that translates SFG into FUG (Kasper, 1988). In addition, FUF provides a typed feature formalism to implement the mutual exclusion, and hierarchical relations in SFG (Elhadad, 1990-1).","By using these formalisms, we have designed and implemented a single sentence generator with SFG. For this purpose, we have designed a Turkish grammar for simple sentences in the FUG formalism, and we have made the required changes in the linearizer of the FUF text generation system in order to handle Turkish morphology.","The lexicalized semantic representation of a sentence must contain the required functions for that","rThese new inputs axe produced and recursively performed by the unifier. sentence.

The most important part of the grammar is the simple sentence that realizes the several semantic functions. So, at the beginning, we have considered the most common grammatical structures of Turkish and their implementation in FUF. The other parts of the grammar such as complex sentences, and the overall generation system including an application program that maps interlingua representations of sentences onto their lexicalized semantic representations are currently under development.","The ultimate generation system will take as input the semantic description of a sentence from an application program, and produce the worded text. The semantic description consists of three metafunctions: ideational such as agent, actor, goal, process, location for representing the constituents of the sentence and their roles; interpersonal such as mood, modality for establishing the relationship between the speaker and the listener; and teztual such as topic, focus, background for presenting information as text in context. The systemic-functional grammar will provide us with useful mechanisms to organize and realize the linguistic resources. References","T. Banguo~lu. T~irk~enin Gramevi.
