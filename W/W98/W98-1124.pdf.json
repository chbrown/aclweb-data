Some of these approaches assume that important textual units contain words that are used frequently (Luhn, 1958; Edmundson, 1968) or words that are used in the title and section headings (Edmundson, 1968). Some of them assume that important sentences are located at the beginning or end of paragraphs (Baxendale, 1958) or at positions that can be determined through training for each particular text genre (Lin and Hovy, 1997). Other systems assume that important sentences in texts contain \"bonus\" words and phrases, such as significant, important, in conclusion and In this paper we show, while unimportant sentences contain \"stigma\" words such as hardly and impossible (Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997). Other systems assume that important sentences and concepts are the highest connected entities in more or less elaborate semantic structures (Skorochodko, 1971; Hoey, 1991; Salt0n and Allan, 1995; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998; Barzilay and Elhadad, 199_7). And, yet, others assume that important sentences and clauses are derivable from a discourse representation of texts (Ono et al., 1994; Marcu, 1997a; Marcu, 1997c).","A variety of systems (Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Lin. 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998) were designed to integrate subsets of the heuristics mentioned above. In these approaches, 206 each individual heuristic yields a probability distribution that reflects the importance of sentences. A combination of the probability distributions defined by each heuristic yields the sentences that are most likely to be included in a summary.","What all these multiple heuristic-based systems have in common is that they treat texts as flat sequences of sentences -- no such system employs discourse-based heuristics. As a consequence, it is possible, for example, a sentence to be assigned a high importance score on the basis of its position in the text and its semantic similarity with the title, although it is subsidiary to the main argument made in the text. In this paper, we remedy this shortcoming, by taking advantage of the structure of discourse.","More precisely, we study the relationship between the structure of discourse and a set of summarization heuristics that are employed by current systems. A tight coupling of the two, which is achieved by applying a simple learning mechanism, gives us two advantages over previous methods. First, two corpora of manually built summaries enable us to learn genre-specific combinations of heuristics that can be used for disambiguation during discourse parsing. Second, the discourse structures that we derive enable us to select textual units that are not only important according to a variety of position-, title-, and lexically-based heuristics, but also central to the main claims of texts.","In section 2, we review the discourse theory and the algorithms that constitute the foundation of our work. We explain then our approach to fusing various summarization heuristics in our discourse processing framework (section 3) and we review each of the heuristics from a discourse perspective.

(There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as CONTRAST, are multinuclear.) The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's purpose than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible in-dependent of the satellite, but not vice versa.","Text coherence in RST is assumed to arise from a set of constraints. The constraints operate on the nucleus, on the satellite, and on the combination of nucleus and satellite. For example, an EVIDENCE relation holds between the nucleus (labelled as 5 in text (1), which is shown below) and the satellite (labelled as 6 in text (1)), because the nucleus presents some information that the writer be-lieves to be insufficiently supported to be accepted by the reader; the satellite presents some information that is thought to be believed by the reader or that is credible to her; and the comprehension of the satellite increases the reader's belief in the nucleus. Rhetorical relations can be assembled into rhetorical structure trees (RS-trees) by recursively applying individualrelations to spans that range in size from one clause-like unit to the whole text.

They are determined in a bottom-up fashion, as follows: the salient unit of a leaf is the leaf itself; the salient units of an internal node are given by the union of the salient units of its immediate nuclear children. For example, the node that spans units [4---6] has salient units 4 and 5 because the immediate children of the node labelled with relation CONTRAST are both nuclei, which have promotion units 4 and 5 respectively; the root node, which spans units [1-10] has 2 as its salient unit because only the node that corresponds to span [1-6] is a nucleus, whose salient unit is 2. In figure 1, parent nodes are linked to subordinated nuclei by solid arrows; parent nodes are linked to subordinated satellites by dotted lines. Discourse-based summarization. Once a discourse structure such as that shown in figure 1 is created, we can derive a partial ordering of the important units in the original text by considering that the units that are promoted closer to the root are more important than those that are promoted less close. By applying this criterion to tree 1, we obtain the partial ordering shown in (2), below, because unit 2 is the only promotion unit associated with the root, unit 8 is the only unit found one level below the root, units 3 and 10 are the only units found two levels below the root, and so on.

In such an approach, the discourse heuristic is just one of the n heuristics that are employed by a system. Obtaining good summaries amounts then to determining a good way of combining the implemented heuristics.","Overall, a summarization system that works along the lines described above still treats texts as flat sequences of textual units, although the discourse method internally uses a more sophisticated representation. The shortcom-ing of such an approach is that it still permits the selec-tion of textual units that do not play a central role in discourse. For example, if the text to be summarized consists only of units 7 and 8 in text (!), it may be possible that the combination of the position, title, and discourse heuristics will yield a higher score for unit 7 than for unit 8, although unit 8 is the nucleus of the text and expresses what is important. Unfortunately, if we interpret text as a flat sequence of units, the rhetorical relation and the nuclearity assignments with respect to these units cannot be appropriately exploited.","A more complex way to integrate discourse, cohesion, position, and other summarization-based methods is to consider that the structure of discourse is the most important factor in determining saliency, an assumption supported by experiments done by Mani et al. (1998). In such an approach, we no longer interpret texts as flat sequences of textual units, but as tree structures that reflect the nuclearity and rhetorical relations that characterize each textual span. When discourse is taken to be central to the interpretation of text, obtaining good summaries amounts to finding the \"best\" discourse interpretations. In the rest of the paper, we explore this approach.","3.2 Criteria for measuring the \"goodness\" of discourse structures In order to find the 'best' discourse interpretations, i.e., the interpretations that yield summaries that are most similar to summaries generated manually, we considered seven metrics, which we discuss below."]},{"title":"208","paragraphs":["The clustering-based metric. A common assumption in the majority of current text theories is that good texts exhibit a well-defined topical structure. In our approach, we assume that a discourse tree is \"better\" if it exhibits a high-level structure that matches as much as possible the topical boundaries of the text for which that structure is built.","In order to capture this intuition, when we build discourse trees, we associate with each node of a tree a clustering score. For the leaves, this score is 0; for the internal nodes, the score is given by the similarity between the immediate children. The similarity is computed using a traditional cosine metric, in the style of Hearst (1997). We consider that a discourse tree ,4 is \"better\" than another discourse tree t3 if the sum of the clustering scores associated with the nodes of A is higher than the sum of the clustering scores associated with the nodes of/3. The marker-based metric. Naturally occurring texts use a wide range of discourse markers, which signal coherence relations between textual spans of various sizes. We assume that a discourse structure should reflect explicitly as many of the discourse relations that are signaled by discourse markers. In other words, we assume that a discourse structure .4 is better than a discourse structure B if+4 uses more rhetorical relations that are explicitly signaled than B. The rhetorical-clustering-based metric. The clustering-based metric discussed above computes an overall similarity between two textual spans. However, in the discourse formalization proposed by Marcu ( 1996; 1997c), it is assumed that whenever a discourse relation holds between two textual spans, that relation also holds between the salient units (nuclei) associated with those spans. We extend this observation to similarity as well, by introducing the rhetorical-clustering-based metric, which measures the similarity between the salient units associated with two spans. For example, the clustering-based score associated with the root of the tree in figure 1 measures the similarity between spans [i,6] and [7,10]. In contrast, the rhetorical-clustering-based score associated with the root of the same tree measures the similarity between units 2 and 8, which are the salient units that pertain to spans [ 1,6] and [7,10] respectively. In the light of the rhetorical-clustering-based metric, we consider that a discourse tree A is \"better\" than another discourse tree B if the sum of the rhetorical-clustering scores associated with the nodes of .4 is higher than the sum of the rhetorical-clustering scores associated with the nodes of B. The shape-based metric. The only disambiguation metric that we used in our previous work (Marcu, 1997b) was the shape-based metric, according to which the \"best\" trees are those that are skewed to the right. The explanation for this metric is that text processing is, essentially, a left-to-right process. In many genres, people write texts so that the most important ideas go first, both at the paragraph and at the text levels. I The more text writers add, the more they elaborate on the text that went before: as a consequence, incremental discourse building consists mostly of expansion of the tight branches. According to the shape-based metric, we consider that a discourse tree A is \"better\" than another discourse tree B if A is more skewed to the right than B (see Marcu (1997c) for a mathematical formulation of the notion of skewedness). The title-based metric. A variety of systems assume that important sentences in a text use words that occur in the title. We measure the similarity between each textual unit and the title by applying a traditional cosine mettic. We compute a title-based score for each discourse structure by computing the similarity between the title and the units that are promoted as salient in that structure. The intuition that we capture in this way is that a discourse structure should be constructed so that it promotes as close to the root as possible the units that are similar with the title. According to the title-based mettic, we consider that a discourse structure A is \"better\" that a discourse structure B if the title-based score of .4 is higher than the title-based score of/3. The position-based metric. Research in summarization (Baxendale, 1958; Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Lin and Hovy, 1997) has shown that, in genres with stereotypical structure, important sentences are often located at the beginning or end of paragraphs/documents. Our position-based metric captures this intuition by assigning a positive score to each textual unit that belongs to the first two or last sentences of the the first three or last two paragraphs. We compute a position-based score for each discourse structure by averaging the position-based scores of the units that are promoted as salient in that discourse structure. The intuition that we capture in this way is that a discourse structure should be constructed so that it promotes as close to the root as possible the units that are located at the beginning or end of a text. According to the position-based metric, we consider that a discourse structure .4 is \"better\" that a discourse structure 13 if the position-based score of .4 is higher than the position-based score of/3. The connectedness-based metric. A heuristic that is often employed by current summarization systems is that of considering important the highest connected entities in more or less elaborate semantic structures (Skorochodko, 1971; Hoey, 1991; Salton and Allan, 1995; Mani and Bloedorn. 1998; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997). We implement this heuristic by computing the average cosine similarity of each textual unit in a text with r~pect to all the other units. We associate a connectedness-based score to each discourse structure by averaging the connectedness-based scores of the units that are promoted as salient in that discourse structure. As in the case of the other met-","t In fact. journalists are trained to employ this \"'pyramid\" approach Io writing consciously (Curnming and McKercher. 1994). 209 tics, we consider that a discourse structure A is \"better\" that a discourse structure B if the connectedness-based score of A is higher than the connectedness-based score of B. 4 Combining heuristics 4.1 The approach As we have already mentioned, discourse parsing is ambiguous the same way sentence parsing is: the rhetorical parsing algorithm often derives more than one discourse structure for a given text. Each of the seven metrics listed above favors a different discourse interpretation.","For the purpose of this paper, we assume that the \"best'\" discourse structures are given by a linear combination of the seven metrics. Hence, along the lines described in section 3.2, we associate with each discourse structure a clusteting-based score sctust, a marker-based score Smark, a rhetorical-clustering-based score Srh~,,t,s~, a shape-based score sshap,, a title-based score SdtlÂ¢, a position-based score Seos, and a connectedness-based score sco,,; and we assume that the best tree of a text is that that corresponds to the discourse structure D that has the highest score s(D). The score s(D) is computed as shown in (3), where wct,,t,... , woo, are weights associated with each metric.","s(D) = w~l.,, x s~l.,,(D)+","tVma~ X Smark( D)-t\" (3) W,~,,.~l,,, X Sr~,,.~t,,s,(D)+","U',hap, X S,hop,( D) + W,i,t, Ã— S,i,l,( O)+","Wpo, x Sp,,,(D) + w~.. x s,-o,(D). To avoid data skewedness, the scores that correspond to each metric are normalized to values between 0 and 1. \" Given the above formulation, our goal is to determine combinations of weights that yield discourse structures that, in turn, yield summaries that are as close as possible to those generated by humans. In discourse terms, this amounts to using empirical summarization data for discourse parsing disambiguation. 4.2 Corpora used in the study In order to evaluate the appropriateness for summarization of each of the heuristics, we have used two corpora: a corpus of 40 newspaper articles from the TREC collection (Jing et al., 1998) and a corpus of five articles from Scientific American (Marcu, ! 997a).","Five human judges selected sentences to be included in 10% and 20% summaries of each of the articles in the TREC corpus (see (Jing et al., 1998) for details). For each of the 40 articles and for each cutoff figure (10% and 20%), we took the set of sentences selected by at least three human judges as the \"gold standard\" for summarization. In our initial experiments, we noticed that the rhetorical parsing algorithm needed more than I minute in order to automatically generate summaries for seven of the 40 articles in the TREC corpus, which were highly ambiguous from a discourse perspective. In order to enable a better employment of training techniques that are specific to machine learning, we partitioned the TREC collection into two subsets. The first subset contained 15 documents: this subset included the seven documents for which our summarization algorithm required ex~tensive computation and eight other documents that were selected randomly. The second subset contained the rest of 25 documents for which our algorithm could generate summaries sufficiently fast. For the purpose of this paper, we will refer to the collection of 25 articles as the \"training corpus\" and to the collection of 15 articles as the \"test corpus\". However, the reader should not take the de:no-tations associated with these referents literally, because the partitioning was not performed randomly. Rather, the reader should see the partitioning only as a means for accelerating the process that determines combination:~ of heuristics that yield the best summarization results for all the texts in the corpus.","The second corpus consisted of five Scientific American texts whose elementary textual units (clause-like units) were labelled by 13 human judges as being very important, somewhat important, or unimportant (see (Marcu, 1997c) for the details of the experiment). For each of the five texts, we took the set of textual units for which at least seven judges agreed to be very important as the gold standard for summarization.","We built automatically discourse structures for the texts in the two corpora using various combinations of weights and we compared the summaries that were derived from these structures with the gold standards. The comparison employed traditional recall and precision figures, which reflected the percent of textual units that were identified correctly by the program with respect to the gold standards and the percent of textual units that were identified correctly by the program with respect to the to-tal number of units that were identified by the program.","For both corpora, we attempted to mimic as closely as possible the summarization tasks carried out by human judges. For the TREC corpus, we automatically extracted summaries at 113% and 20% cutoffs; for the Scientific American corpus, we automatically extracted summaries that reflected the lengths of the summaries on which human judges agreed. 4.3 Appropriateness for summarization of the","individual heuristics The TREC corpus. Initially, we evaluated the appropriateness for text summarization of each of the seven heuristics at both 10% and 20% cutoffs for the collection of texts in the TREC corpus. By assigning in turn value 1 to each of the seven weights, while the other six weights were assigned value 0, we estimated the appropriateness of using each individual metric for text summarization.","Tables 1 and 2 show the recall and precision figures that pertain to discourse structures that were built for the TREC corpus, in order to evaluate the appropriateness for text summarization of each of the seven metrics at 10% and 20% cutoffs, respectively.

The recall and precision figures for the human judges were computed by taking the average recall and precision of the summaries built by each human judge individually when compared with the gold standard. These recall and precision figures can be interpreted as summarization upper-bounds for the collection of texts that they characterize. Since each judge contributed to the derivation of the gold standards, the recall and precision figures that pertain to human judges are biased: they are probably higher than the figures that would characterize an outsider to the experiment.","The recall and precision figures that pertain to the baseline algorithms are computed as follows: the lead-based algorithm assumes that important units are located at the beginning of texts; the random-based algorithm assumes that important units can be selected randomly.","The results in table 1 show that, for newspaper articles, the title- and position-based metrics are the best individual metrics for distinguishing between discourse trees that are appropriate for generating 10% summaries and discourse trees that are not.

The data also shows that the optimal combinations need not necessarily follow a common pattern: for example, the combinations of heuristics that yield the highest F-values of the recall and precision figures for the 10% cutoff in the TREC corpus differ dramatically: one combination relies almost entirely on the position-based heuristic, while the other combination uses a much more balanced combination of heuristics that is slightly biased towards assigning more importance to the clustering-based heuristic.","In addition to the analysis of the patterns of weights that yielded optimal summaries in the two corpora, we also examined the appropriateness of using combinations of weights that were optimal for a given summary cutoff in order to summarize texts at a different cutoff. Table 7 shows the recall and precision figures that.are obtained when the patterns of weights that yielded optimal summaries at 10% cutoff are used to summarize the texts in the TREC corpus at 20% cutoff; and the recall and precision figures that are obtained when the patterns of weights that yielded optimal summaries at 20% cutoff are used to summarize the same texts at 10% cutoff. As the figures in table 7 show. the combinations of heuristics that yielded 214 optimal summaries at a particular cutoffdo not yield optimal summaries at other cutoffs, although we can still find combinations of heuristics that outperform the lead-based algorithm at both cutoffs. The results in table 7 suggest that there are at least two ways in which one can train a summarization system. If the system is going to be used frequently to summarize texts at a given cutoff, then it makes sense to train it to produce good summaries at that cutoff. However, if the system is going to be used to generate summaries of various lengths, then a different training methodology should be adopted, one that would ensure optimality across the whole cutoff spectrum, from 1 to 99%."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["The empirical and computational experiments that we described in this paper suppon at least the following conclusions. 1. For extracting 10% summaries of short articles of the news story genre, a simple lead-based algorithm is the most efficient solution. 2. For extracting longer summaries of short newspaper articles and for extracting any size summaries of complex (not necessarily news stories) newspaper articles, a simple lead-based algorithm does not provide a satisfactory solution. This assertion holds for other text genres, such as that of Scientific American, as well. 3. There is no magic key (heuristic) for obraining good summarization results; rather the strength of a summarization system seems to come from its ability to combine a multitude of heuristics. 4. Combinations of heuristics that yield \"optimal\" results for certain summary extract lengths might not yield optimal results for different lengths. 5. Incorporating various heuristics into a discourse-based summarization framework yields good results. 6. In order to assess confidently the effectiveness of the summarization methodology that was introduced here, much larger corpora are required. Acknowledgements.
