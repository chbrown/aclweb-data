The system exploits information from multiple sources, including letter n-grams, character confusion probabilities, and word-bigram probabilities. Letter n-grams are used to index the words in the lexicon. Given a sentence to be corrected, the system decomposes each string in the sentence into letter n-grams and retrieves word candidates from the lexicon by comparing string n-grams with lexicon-entry n-grams. The retrieved candidates are ranked by the conditional probability of matches with the string, given character confusion probabilities. Finally, the wordobigram model and Viterbi algorithm are used to determine the best scoring word sequence for the sentence. The system can correct non-word errors as well as real-word errors and achieves a 60.2% error reduction rate for real OCR text. In addition, the system can learn the character confusion probabilities for a specific OCR environment and use them in self-calibration to achieve better performance."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word errors present problems for various text- or speech-based applications such as optical character recognition (OCR) and voice-input computer interfaces. In particular, though current OCR technology is quite refined and robust, sources such as old books, poor-quality (nth-generation) photocopies, and faxes can still be difficult to process and may cause many OCR errors. For OCR to be truly useful in a wide range of applications, such as office automation and information retrieval systems, OCR reliability must be improved. A method for the automatic correction of OCR errors would be clearly beneficial.","Essentially, there are two types of word errors: non-word errors and real-word errors. A non-word error occurs when a word in a source text is interpreted (under OCR) as a string that does not correspond to any valid word in a given word list or dictionary. A real-word error occurs when a source-text word is interpreted as a string that actually does occur in the dictionary, but is not identical with the source-text word. For example, if the source text \"John found the man\" is rendered as \"John fornd he man\" by an OCR device, then \"fornd\" is a non-word error and \"he\" is a real-word error. In general, non-word errors will never correspond to any dictionary entries and 88 will include wildly incorrect strings (such as \"#--&&') as well as misrecognized alpha-numeric sequences (such as \"BN234\" for \"8N234\"). However, some non-word errors might become real-word errors if the size of the word list or dictionary increases. (For example, the word \"ruel \"~ might count as a non-word error for the source-text word \"rut\" if a small dictionary is used for reference, but count as a real-word error if an unabridged dictionary is used.) While non-word errors might be corrected without considering the context in which the error occurs, a real-word error can only be corrected by taking context into account.","The problems of word-error detection and correction have been studied for several decades. A good survey in this area can be found in [Kukich 1992]. Most traditional word-correction techniques concentrate on non-word error correction and do not consider the context in which the error appears.","Recently, statistical language models (SLMs) and feature-based methods have been used for context-sensitive spelling-error correction. For example, Atwell and Elliittm [1987] have used a part-of-speech (POS) tagging method to detect the real-word errors in text. Mays and colleagues [1991] have exploited word trigrams to detect and correct both the non-word and real-word errors that were artificially generated from 100 sentences. Church and Gale [1991] have used a Bayesian classifier method to improve the performance for non-word error correction. Golding [1995] has applied a hybrid Bayesian method for real-word error correction and Golding and Schabes [1996] have combined a POS trigram and Bayesian methods for the same purpose.","The goal of the work described here is to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SLM-based methods applied to the problem of OCR error correction. Since POS-based methods are not effective in distinguishing among candidates with the same POS tags and since methods based on word-trigram models involve extensive training data and require that huge word-trigram tables be available at run time, we used a word-bigram SLM as the first step in our investigation.","In this paper, we describe a system that uses a word-bigram SLM technique to correct OCR errors. The system takes advantage of information from multiple sources, including letter n-grams, character confusion probabilities, and word bigram probabilities, to effect context-based word error correction. It can correct non-word as well as real-word errors. In addition, the system can learn the character confusion probability table for a specific OCR environment and use it to achieve better performance."]},{"title":"2 The Approach 2.1 Problem Statement","paragraphs":["The problem of context-based OCR word-error correction can be stated as follows:","Let L = {wl, w~, ..., win} be the set of all the words in a given lexicon.

On the other hand if a is very low, some correct words may be detected as real-word errors and will be changed.","If we have both the original text and the corresponding OCR output and if we assume that the errors made by a particular OCR system are not random (but semi-deterministic), we can count the 91 cases of substitution, deletion, and insertion using a method similar to computing the minimum edit distance between strings [Wagner 1974] and we can estimate the probabilities using formulas similar to those in [Church & Gale 1991]:","pr(ylx ) = num(sub(x,y))/num(x) (11) pr(del(x)) = num(del(x))/num(x) (12) pr(ins(y)) = num(ins(y))/num( Kall letters> ) (13)","Obviously, in practice, we typically do not have the original text to compare to the OCR text or to use for correction. Moreover, as noted in [Liu et al. 1991], the character confusion characteristics are heavily dependent on the OCR environment, encompassing everything from the performance biases of the specific OCR software to the size of characters in the source text, fonts used, individual character types, and print quality of the text being processed. It is not feasible to train on texts to acquire character confusion probabilities for each OCR environment.","The current system employs an iterative learning-from-correcting technique that treats the corrected OCR text as an approximation of the original text. The system starts by assuming all characters are equally likely to be misrecognized (with some uniform, small probability) and learns the character confusion probabilities by comparing the OCR text to the corrected OCR text after each pass. Then the learned character confusion probabilities are used for the next pass processing (feedback processing). This method proves to be quite effective in improving system performance. 2.3 Generation of Word Candidates for a Given String Ideally, each word, w, in the lexicon should be compared to a given OCR string, s, to compute the conditional probability, pr(wls ). However, this approach would be computationally too expensive. Instead, the system operates in two steps, first to generate the candidates and then to specify the maximal number of candidates, N, to be considered for the correction of an OCR string.","In step 1, the system retrieves a large list of word candidates for a given string. To nominate candidates, we use a vector space information retrieval technique [Salton 1989]: all the words in the lexicon are indexed by letter n-grams and the (OCR) string, also parsed into letter n-grams, is treated as a query over the database of lexicon entries. In particular, all words (or OCR strings) are indexed by their letter trigrams, including the 'beginning' and 'end' spaces surrounding the string. Words of four or fewer characters are also indexed by their letter bigrams. For example: \"the\" ~ {#th, the, he#, #t, th, he, e#} \"example\" ~ {#ex, exa, xam, mpl, ple, le#}","A given OCR string to be corrected is represented by a vector containing its letter n-grams.","Using the vector as the query, the lexicon words that are similar to the word error are retrieved,","giving a large list of candidate correct forms. Candidates must share at least some features with","the input string (query). A ranked list can be generated by scoring matches using a simple term","frequency (TF) count--the number of matches between the query vector and the n-gram vector of","a candidate word. For example, given the string:","\"exanple\" ~ {#exanple#} {#ex, exa, xan, anp, npl, ple, le#} the word \"example\" is a candidate: 92"]},{"title":"\"example\" ~ {#example#} {#ex, exa, xam, amp, mpl, pie, le#} Since the two items share four letter n-grams--\"#ex', \"exa', \"ple\", and \"le#'--the TF score of the candidate word \"example\" for the input string \"exanple\" is four. Note also that the TF score can be used to establish a threshold or cutoff score to limit the number of candidates to consider. In step 2, the system re-ranks the words in the candidate list using channel probabilities as described above. On average, the system generates several hundred candidates for a given string. Only the first N candidates are retained for context-based word-error correction. 2.4 The Word Correction System for OCR Post-Processing The architecture of the word correction system for OCR post-processing is given in Figure 1.

It uses the new confusion table for the next-pass correction of the OCR text.","Sin its non-word error mode of operation, the system treats every word that does not match a lexicon entry as a possible error.

Performance also improves significantly in the first feedback process, as the system learns the character confusion probabilities by correcting the OCR text. The second and third feedback steps have only slight effect on the error reduction rates. Indeed, in experiment 3, the result from the third feedback pass is actually worse than that from the second feedback pass. These results indicate that an initial pass followed by two feedback passes may optimize the method. In the following discussion, we compare the three experiments using the results obtained from the second feedback step (Feedback-2).","As we might expect, the results from the context-based experiments are much better than those from the isolated-word experiment. The error reduction rates in experiments 2 and 3 are, 08 respectively, 10.3% and 17.1% higher than the rate in experiment 1. This indicates that even a modest (e.g., bigram-based) representation of context is useful in selecting the best candidates for word-error correction.","In all three experiments, the system introduced 182 new errors due to false corrections of words that were not in the lexicon. (Recall that the system lexicon is based on the words derived from the training corpus; some words may be present in the test corpus that are not in the training corpus.) Whenever the system encounters an unknown word, it treats it as a non-word error and attempts to correct it. In such cases, the system replaces the presumed non-word error with a word from its lexicon. Thus, for example, if the system encounters the word \"MobileData\" (a correct name) in the OCR output, but does not have \"MobileData\" in its lexicon, it might change \"MobileData\" to \"MobileComm\" (a word that does exist in the training corpus lexicon). Of course, such problems in processing unknown words are not unique to OCR error correction; they represent a general problem for all natural-language processing tasks.","As shown by experiment 3, when the system uses context-based non- and real-word error correction, it achieves a total error reduction rate of 60.2%. This is 6.8% higher than the rate achieved in the context-based non-word experiment. The improvement in performance is gained principally from the reduction of the real-word errors. Although the system introduces additional errors--since all the strings in the OCR text are treated as possible errors and subject to change--the number of corrected real-word errors far exceeds the number of real-word errors introduced. In the second feedback pass, for example, the system introduced 141 new errors by changing correct lexicon words into other lexicon words. On the other hand, the system properly corrected 684 real errors--32.1% of all the real errors. The corrected OCR text, therefore, has 543 fewer real-word errors than the original OCR text.","Certain types of errors in the source or OCR-output text present systematic problems for our approach, highlighting the limitations of the system. In particular, because the process is based on the structural definition of a word (viz., a character sequence 'between white space')--not a morphological one--any errors that obscure word boundaries will defy correction. For example, run-on errors (e.g., \"of the\"/\"ofthe\") and split-word errors (\"training\" /\"train ng') cannot be corrected. In addition, the use of a vector-space querying to find candidate lexical entries-- including our special approach to word decomposition and scoring--can present problems when processing some OCR errors, especially short strings. For example, if \"both\" (in the source) is rendered as \"hotn\" (in the OCR text), it is not possible for the system to generate \"both\" as one of the high-ranked candidates--they share only one feature, the bigram \"ot\"-- despite the fact that the conditional probability pr(\"hotn\"l\"both\" ) might be high. Finally, the system suffers from the common limitation of word bigram or trigram models in that it cannot capture discourse properties of context, such as topic and tense, which are sometimes required to select the correct word."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["The system we have created uses information from a variety of sources--qetter n-grams, character confusion probabilities, and word-bigram probabilities---to realize context-based, automatic, word-error correction.
