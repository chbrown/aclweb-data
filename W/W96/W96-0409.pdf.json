In the absence of any information regarding the information structure of a sentence (i.e., topic, focus, background, etc.), the constituents of the sentence obey a default order, but the order is almost freely changeable, depending on the constraints of the text flow or discourse. We have used a recursively structured finite state machine for handling the changes in constituent order, implemented as a right-linear grammar backbone. Our implementation environment is the GenKit system, developed at Carnegie Mellon University-Center for Machine Translation. Morphological realization has been implemented using an external morpholggical analysis/generation component which performs concrete morpheme selection and handles morphographemic processes. Introduction Natural Language Generation is the operation of producing natural language sentences using specified communicative goals. This process consists of three main kinds of activities (McDonald, 1987):","Â• the goals the utterance is to obtain must be determined,","Â• the way the goals may be obtained must be planned, Â• the plans should be realized as text. Tactical generation is the realization, as linear text, of the contents specified usually using some kind of a feature structure that is generated by a higher level process such as text planning, or transfer in machine translation applications. In this process, a generation grammar and a generation lexicon are used.","As a component of a large scale project on natural language processing for Turkish, we have undertaken the development of a generator for Turkish sentences. In order to implement the variations in the constituent order dictated by various information structure constraints, we have used a recursively structured finite state machine instead of enumerat-ing grammar rules for all possible word orders. A second reason for this approach is that many constituents, especially the arguments of verbs are typically optional and dealing with such optionality within rules proved to be rather problematic. Our implementation is based on"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["GenKit environment developed at Carnegie Mellon University-Center for Machine Translation.

We then present an overview of the feature structures for representing the contents and the information structure of these sentences, along with the recursive finite state machine that generates the proper order required by the grammatical and information structure constraints. Later, we give the highlights of the generation grammar architecture along with some example rules and sample outputs. We then present a discussion comparing our approach with similar work, on Turkish generation and conclude with some fi-nal comments. 81"]},{"title":"Turkish","paragraphs":["In terms of word order, Turkish can be characterized as a"]},{"title":"subject-object-verb (SOV) language","paragraphs":["in which constituents at certain phrase levels can change order rather freely, depending on the constraints of text flow or discourse. The morphology of Turkish enables morphological markings on the constituents to sig-nal their grammatical roles without relying on their order. This, however, does not mean that word order is immaterial. Sentences with different word orders reflect different pragmatic conditions, in that, topic, focus and background information conveyed by such sentences differ, t Information conveyed through intonation, stress and/or clefting in fixed word order languages such as English, is expressed in Turkish by changing the order of the constituents. Obviously, there are certain constraints on constituent order, especially, inside noun and postpositional phrases. There are also certain constraints at sentence level when explicit case marking is not used (e.g., with indefinite direct objects).","In Turkish, the information which links the sentence to the previous context, the"]},{"title":"topic,","paragraphs":["is in the first position.

This is due to the fact that, both the subject and the indefinite","1See Erguvanh (1979) for a discussion of the function of word order in Turkish grammar. direct object have no surface case-marking that distinguishes them, so word order constraints come into play to force this distinction.","In order to present the flavor of word order variations in Turkish, we provide the following examples. These two sentences are used to describe the same event (i.e., have the same logical form), but they are used in different discourse situations.

The feature structures for sentences are represented using a case-frame representation. Sentential arguments of verbs ad-here to the same morphosyntactic constraints as the nominal arguments (e.g., the participle of, say, a clause that acts as a direct object is case-marked accusative, just as the nominal one would be). This enables a nice recursire embedding of case-frames of similar general structure to be used to represent sentential arguments.","In the next sections, we will highlight relevant aspects of our feature structures for sentences and their constituents. Simple Sentences We use the case-frame feature structure in Figure 1 to encode the contents of a sentence. 3 We use the information given in the CONTROL feature to guide our grammar in generating the appropriate sentential constituent order. This information is exploited by a right linear grammar (recursively structured nevertheless) to generate the proper order of constituents at every sentential level (including embedded sentential clauses with their own information structure). The simplified outline of this right linear grammar is given as a finite state machine in Figure 2. Here, transitions are labeled by constraints and constituents (shown in bold face along a transition arc) which are generated when those constraints are satisfied. If any transition has a NIL label, then no surface form is generated for that transition.","The recursive behavior of this finite state machine comes from the fact that the individual argument or adjunct constituents can also embed sentential clauses. Sentential clauses","3Here, c-name denotes a feature structure for representing noun phrases or case-frames representing embedded sentential forms which can be used as nominal or adverbial constituents. \"S-FORM CLAUSE-TYPE VOICE SPEECH-ACT QUES VERB ARGS ADJN CONTROL infinitive/adverbial/participle/finite existential/attributive/predicative active/reflexive/reciprocal/passive/causative imperative/opt ative/necessit ative/wish/ interrogative/declarative TYPE yes-no/wh ] CONST list-of(subject/dir-obj/etÂ¢,)J ROOT verb POLARITY negative/positive TENSE present/past/future ASPECT progressive/habitual/etc. MODALITY potentiality DIR-OBJ c-name SOURCE c.name GOAL c-name LOCATION c.name BENEFICIARY c-narne INSTRUMENT c-narne VALUE c-name TIME c-name-PLACE e-name MANNER c-name PATH c-narne DURATION c-name \"TOPIC constituent\" FOCUS constituent BACKGR constituent Figure 1: The case-frame for Turkish sentences. correspond to either full sentences with non-finite or participle verb forms which act as noun phrases in either argument or adjunct roles, or gapped sentences with participle verb forms which function as modifiers of noun phrases (the filler of the gap). The former non-gapped forms can in Turkish be further classified into those representing acts, facts and adverbials. The latter (gapped form) is linked to the filler noun phrase by the ROLES feature in the structure for noun phrase (which will be presented in the following sections): this feature encodes the (semantic) role filled by the filler noun phrase and the case-frame of the sentential clause. The details of the feature structures for sentential clauses are very similar to the structure for the case-frame. Thus, when an argument or adjunct, which is a sentential clause, is to be realized, the clause is recursively generated by using the same set of transitions. For example, the verb 'g6r' (see) takes a direct object which can be a sentential clause: 83"]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["AyÂ§e'nin geliÂ§ini Ay~e+GEN come+INF+P3SG 'I did not see Ay~e's coming.' g6rmedim. see+NEG+PAST+ISG Similarly, the subject or any other constituent of a sentence can also be a sentential clause: (4) Ali'nin buraya gelmesi AIi+GEN here come+INF+P3SG 'Ali's coming here made us bizim i~i bitirmemizi we+GEN the_job finish+INF+P1PL+ACC finish the job easier.' kolayl~tlr&. make_easy+PAST+3SG","In all these cases, the main sentence generator also generates the sentential subjects and objects, in addition to generating the main sentence.

So, phrasal modifiers always precede lexical modifiers and phrasal specifiers precede lexical specifiers, unless otherwise specified, in which case punctuation needs to be used.","Â• Tile possessor may scramble to a position past the head or even outside the phrase (to a background position), or allow some adverbial adjunct intervene between it and the rest of the noun phrase, causing a discontinuous constituent. Although we have included control information for scrambling the possessor to post head position, we have opted not to deal with either discontinuous constituents or long(er) distance scrambling as these are mainly used in spoken discourse.","Furthermore, since the possessor information is explicitly marked on the head noun, if the discourse does not require an overt possessor 5 it may be dropped by suitable set-ting of the DROP feature.

I+GEN book+P1SG thick 'My book is thick.'","c. * Kitablm kahn. book+P1SG thick analyzer of Turkish (Oflazer, 1993). Within GenKit, we generate relevant abstract morphological features such as agreement and possessive markers and case marker for nominals and voice, polarity, tense, aspect, mood and agreement markers for verbal forms. This information is properly ordered at the interface and sent to the morphological generator, which then:","1. performs concrete morpheme selection, dictated by the morphotactic constraints and morphophonological context,","2. handles morphographemic phenomena such as vowel harmony, and vowel and consonant ellipsis, and","3. produces an agglutinative surface form.","Grammar Architecture and Output Our generation grammar is written in a formalism called Pseudo Unification Grammar implemented by the GenKit generation system (Tomita and Nyberg, 1988). Each rule consists of a context-free phrase structure description and a set of feature constraint equations, which are used to express constraints on feature values. Non-terminals in the phrase structure part of a rule are referenced as x0 ..... xn in the equations, where x0 corresponds to the non-terminal in the left hand side, and xn is the n th non-terminal in the right hand side. Since the context-free rules are directly compiled into tables, the performance of the system is essentially independent of the number of rules, but depends on the complexity of the feature constraint equations (which are compiled into LISP code). Currently, our grammar has 273 rules each with very simple constraint checks. Of these 273 rules, 133 are for sentences and 107 are for noun phrases.","To implement the sentence level generator (described by the finite state machine presented earlier), we use rules of the form: Si ----~ XP Sj where the Si and"]},{"title":"Sj","paragraphs":["denote some state in the finite state machine and the XP denotes the constituent to be realized while taking this transition.

The solid lines show the transitions that the generator makes in its right linear backbone. Comparison with Related Work Dick (1993) has worked on a classification based language generator for Turkish. His goal was to generate Turkish sentences of varying complexity, from input semantic representations in Penman's Sentence Planning Language (SPL). However, his generator is not complete, in that, noun phrase structures in their entirety, postpositional phrases, word order variations, and many morphological phenomena are not implemented. Our generator differs from his in various aspects: We use a case-frame based input representation which we feel is more suitable for languages with free constituent order. Our coverage of the grammar is substantially higher than the coverage presented in his thesis and we also use a full-scale external morphological generator to deal with complex morphological phenomena of agglutinative lexical forms of Turkish, which he has attempted embedding into the sentence generator itself.","Hoffman, in her thesis (Hoffman, 1995a, Hoffman, 1995b), has used the Multiset-Combinatory Categorial Grammar formalism (Hoffman, 1992), an extension of Combinatory Categorial Grammar to handle free word order languages, to develop a generator for Turkish. Her generator also uses relevant features of the information structure of the input and can handle word order variations within embedded clauses. She can also deal with scrambling out of a clause dictated by information structure constraints, as her formalism allows this in a very convenient manner. The word order information is lexically kept as multisets associ-ated with each verb. She has demonstrated the capabilities of her system as a component of a prototype database query system. We have been influenced by her approach to incorporate information structure in generation, but, since our aim is to build a wide-coverage generator for Turkish for use in a machine translation application, we have opted to use a simpler formalism and a very robust implementation environment. Conclusions We have presented the highlights of our work on tactical generation in Turkish - a free constituent order language with agglutinative word structures. In addition to the content information, our generator takes as input the information structure of the sentence (topic, focus and background) and uses these to select the appropriate word order. Our grammar uses a right-linear rule backbone which implements a (recursive) finite state machine for dealing with alternative word orders. We have also provided for constituent order and stylistic variations within noun phrases based on certain emphasis and formality features. We plan to use this generator in a prototype transfer-based human assisted machine translation system from English to Turkish.
