A requirements analyst builds a formal object-oriented (OO) data model (modeling). A user (domain expert) performs a validation of the formal model. Then, the requirements model undergoes subsequent evolution (modification or adjustment) by a (perhaps different) analyst.","It is widely believed that graphical representations are easy to learn and use, both for modeling and for communication among the engineers and domain experts who together develop the OO data model. This belief is reflected by the large number of graphical OO data modeling tools currently in research labs and on the market. However, this belief is a fallacy, as some recent empirical studies show. For example, Kim (1990) simulated a modeling task with experienced analysts and a validation task with sophisticated users not familiar with the particular graphical language. Both user groups showed semantic error rates between 25% and 70% for the separately scored areas of entities, attributes, and relations. Relations were particularly troublesome to both analysts and users. Marian (1995) compares diagrams with textual representations of nested conditional structures (which can be compared to data modeling in the complexity of the \"paths\" through the system). He hnas that \"'the mmnslc difficulty of the graphics mode was the strongest effect observed\" (p.35). We therefore conclude that graphics, in order to assure maximum communicative efficiency, needs to be complemented by an alternate view of the data. We claim that the alternate view should be provided by an explanation tool that represents the data in the form of a Standard English text. This paper presents such a tool, the MODELEXPLAINER, or MoDEx for short.","Automatically generating natural-language descriptions of software models and specifications is not a new idea. The first such system was Swartout's GIST Paraphraser (Swartout, 1982). More recent projects include the paraphraser in ARIES (Johnson et al., 1992); the GEMA data-flow diagram describer (Scott and de Souza, 1989); and Gulla's paraphraser for the PPP system (Gulla, 1993). MODEx certainly belongs in the tradition of these specification paraphrasers, but the combination of features that we will describe in the next section is. to our knowledge, unique. 2 Features of MoDEx Our design is based on initial interviews with potential users, and on subsequent feedback from actual users during an iterative prototyp-ing approach.","Â• MoDEx includes examples in its texts: as well as conventional descriptions. The need for examples in documentation has been pointed out in recent work by Paris and Mittal (see for example (Mittal and Paris, 1'293) and the references cited therein). However, none of the specification paraphrasers proposed to date have included examples.","• MoDEx uses an interactive hypertext interface to allow users to browse through the model. Such interfaces have been used in other NLG applications, (e.g., (Reiter etal., 1995; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992)), but ours is based on (now) standard html-based WWW technology.","• MoDEx uses a simple modeling language, which is based on the ODL standard developed by the Object Database Management Group (OMC) (Cattail, 1994). Some previous systems have paraphrased complex modeling languages that are not widely used outside the research community (GIST, PPP).","• MoDEx does not have access to knowledge about the domain of the data model (beyond the data model itself). At least one previous system has used such knowledge (GEMA). 3 A MoDEx Scenario Figure 1: The University O-O Diagram Suppose that a university has hired a consultant analyst to build an information system for its administration. The analyst has devised a data-model and shows it to a university administrator for validation. The model is shown in Figure 1; it is adapted from (Cattell, 1994, p.56). It uses the \"crow's foot\" notation of Martin and Odell (1992) for cardinality on relations. The administrator is not familiar with this notation and cannot easily understand it. He invokes MoDEx to generate a textual description in English of a particular as-pect of the model, namely of the SECTION class (Figure 2). The text is viewed via a World-Wide-Web browser such as Netscape or Mosaic.

This text, especially with its boundary-value examples, makes it very clear that the model allows a SECTION tO belong to no COURSES, and also allows a SECTION to belong to more than one COURSE. In l/) Description of the relation 'Is section of' General Observations: A section may belong, to zero or more Courses. For example, S1 is a Sectioa and belongs to the Course CS100. $2 is a Section and does not belong to any Courses. $3 is a Section and belongs to three Courses, MathlG0, Physicsl00, and Engl00. Description of the relation 'Is section of' General Observations: A section must belong to exactly one Course. For example, $1 is a Sect~\"~d belongs to the Course CS100. Cardinality: It is illegal for a Section to belong to zero Courses. For example, it would be illegal for the Section $2 not to belong to any Courses. In addition, It is illegal for a Section to belong to more than one Course. For example, it would be illegal for the Section $3 to belong to two Courses, Math100 and Physics100. Figure 3: Two descriptions of is section of his institution, each section belongs to exactly one course. (We have observed such cardinality mistakes in many OO models.) The analyst fixes this and reruns MoDEx on this relation, obtaining the description shown in Figure 3 (bottom). The text now contains a new section with negative examples, which makes it clear that it is no longer possible for a SECTION to belong either to zero COURSES or to multiple COURSES.","Several other types of text can be generated, such as path descriptions and comparisons and texts about several classes. We refer to (Lavoie et al., 1996) for more detailed information. 4 How MODEx Works MODEx is implemented using the now fairly standard, modular pipeline architecture. Several modules are part of COGENT, CoGenTex's generator shell. MoDEx operates as a 'Web server' which generates HTML files that can be viewed by any Web browser. For lack of space we refrain from giving details here and refer to (Lavoie et al., 1996) for details. 5 Restrictions on the Object Model MoDEx is designed for use independent of the domain of the OO data model that is being described: it lacks domain knowledge. This means that the system is fully portable between modeling domains, and is not overly costly to use. However, this also means that the system cannot detect semantic modeling errors. Instead, MoDEx works by providing the analyst or domain expert with a different representation of the model, namely in English. Having a second view in an easily accessible code allows him or her to more easily detect semantic errors.","Furthermore, the lack of domain knowledge also means that MoDEx cannot choose the correct paraphrase for an ambiguous part of a model. For example, analysts usually label relations with either nouns or verbs, giving rise to paraphrases such as A committee determines issues (verb) or A committee has an issue as its topic (noun). However, suppose the analyst in-troduces a relation called top between classes GULFINKEL and WORROW. Since top can'be either a noun or a verb in English, the analyst could either mean that A gulfinkel tops a worrow or that A gulfinkel has a worrow as its top. The two statements are presumably incompatible, but the correct one can only be chosen on the basis of knowledge about the (fictitious) gulfinkel-worrow domain - which MoDEx lacks.","We deal with this problem by requiring the MoDEx user to follow certain conventions with respect to the labeling of relations and objects. The MODEx expects classes to be labeled with singular nouns, and relations to be labeled with third person singular active verbs, passive verbs with by, or nouns. Verbs and nouns can be followed by a preposition, and there can be additional material (arguments, adjuncts) between a verb and its preposition.","In fact, while such conventions appear to be limiting at first, they serve a second purpose, namely that of imposing discipline in naming. In a data model, it is important that names be used consistently for naming objects and relations, since otherwise the model is difficult to understand whether or 11 not MoDEx is used. For example, a designer, looking at a graphical representation of a data model, .may well misunderstand the gulfinkel-worrow relation above and interpret it in the opposite manner from what the requirements analyst (who devised the model) in-tended. Larger object-oriented software engineering projects therefore develop naming conventions, and Martin and Odell (1992, p.134) say (somwhat vaguely) that two classes connected by a relation \"ought to read like a setence\". Thus, MoDEx can serve the purpose of enforcing such naming conventions, since if they are not followed, the text will be nonsensical, or even unreadable. 6 Outlook The MoDEx is implemented in C++ on both UNIX and PC platforms. It has been integrated with two object-oriented modeling environments, the ADM (Advanced Development Model) of the KBSA (Knowledge-Based Software Assistant) (DeBellis et al., 1992), and with Ptech, a commercial off-the-shelf object modeling tool. MoBEx has been fielded at a software engineering lab at Raytheon, Inc., with interesting and encouraging initial feedback.","Currently, we are pursuing several development directions. For example, we are extend-ing the system to allow the user to enter free text associated with particular objects in the model (such as classes, attributes). This free text can capture information not deducible from the model (such as high-level descriptions of purpose), and will be integrated with the automatically generated text. We are also developing a facility to direct the output of MoDEx to commercial off-the-shelf publishing environments for the production of standard (paper-based) documentation.
