Translation candidates of word sequences are evaluated by a similarity measure between the sequences defined by the co-occurrence frequency and independent frequency of the word sequences. The similarity measure is an extension of Dice coefficient. An iterative method with gradual threshold lowering is proposed for getting a high quality translation dictionary. The method is tested with parallel corpora of three distinct domains and achieved over 80~0 accuracy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A high quality translation dictionary is indispensable for machine translation systems with good performance, especially for domains of expertise. Such dictionaries are only effectively usable for their own domains, much human labour will be mitigated if such a dictionary is obtained in an automatic way from a set of translation examples.","This paper proposes a method to construct a translation dictionary that consists of not only word pairs but pairs of arbitrary length word sequences of the two languages. All of the pairs are extracted from a parallel corpus of a specific domain. The method is proposed and is evaluated with Japanese-English parallel corpora of three distinct domains.","Several attempts have been made for similar purposes, but with different settings. (see [Kupiec 93][Kumano & Hirakawa 94][Smadja 96])","Kupiec and Kumano ~ Hirakawa propose a method of obtaining translation patterns of noun compound from bilingual corpora. Kumano & Hirakawa stand on a different setting from the other works in that they assume ordinary bilingual dictionary and use non-parallel (non-aligned) corpora. Their target is to find correspondences not only of word level but of noun phrases and unknown words. However, the target noun phrases and unknown words are decided in the preprocessing stage.","Brown et al. use a probabilistic measure for estimating word similarity of two languages in their statistical approach of language translation [Brown 88]. In their work of aligning of parallel texts, Kay & RSscheisen used the Dice coefficient as the word similarity for insuring sentence level correspondence [Kay & RSscheisen 93].","Kitamura & Matsumoto use the same measure to calculate word similarity in their work of extraction of translation patterns. The similarity measure is used as the basis of their structural matching of parallel sentences so as to extract structural translation patterns. In texts of expertise a number of word sequence correspondences, not word-word correspondences, are abundant especially in the form of noun compounds or of fixed phrases, which are keys for better performance. Though the method proposed in this paper deals only with consecutive sequences of words and is intended to provide a better base for the structural matching that follows, the results themselves show very useful and informative translation patterns for the domain.","Our method extends the usage of the Dice coefficient in two ways: It deals not only with correspondence between the words but with correspondence between word-sequences, and it modifies the formula measure so that more plausible corresponding pairs are identified earlier. 79"]},{"title":"2 Related Work and Some Results","paragraphs":["Brown et. al., used mutual information to construct corresponding pairs of French and English words.

A comparison between the above two method is done on a parallel corpus and the results are reported in [Ohmori 96]. They applied both approaches to a French-English corpus of about one thousand sentence pairs. The results are shown in Table 1 where the correctness is checked by human inspection. Since both methods show very inaccurate results for the words of one occurrence, only the words of two or more occurrences are selected for inspection. Table 1 shows the proportion that a French word is paired with the correct English words checked with the top, three and five highest candidates.","Num. of words Mutual Information 697 Dice coefficient 574","1st candidate within best 3 within best 5 43.6% 60.0% 65.4% 46.2% 65.0% 66.5% Table 1: Comparison of Mutual Information and Dice coefficient","The results show that though Dice coefficient gives a slightly better correctness both methods do not generate satisfactory translation pairs.","[Kupiec 93] and [Kumano & Hirakawa 94] broaden the target to correspondences between word sequences such as compound nouns. Kupiec uses NP recognizer for both English and French and proposed a method to calculate the probabilities of correspondences using an iterative algorithm like the EM algorithm. He reports that in one hundred highest ranking correspondences ninety of them were correct. Although the NP recognizers detect about 5000 distinct noun phrases in both languages, the correctness ratio of the total data is not reported.","Kumono & Hirakawa's objective is to obtain English translation of Japanese compound nouns (noun sequences) and unknown words using a statistical method similar to Brown's together with an ordinary Japanese-English dictionary. Japanese compound nouns and unknown words are detected by the morphological analysis stage and are determined before the later processes. Though they assume unaligned Japanese-English parallel corpora, alignment is performed beforehand. In an experiment with two thousand sentence pairs, 72.9% correctness is achieved by the best correspondences and 83.8% correctness by the top three candidates in the case of compound nouns. The correctness ratios for unknown words are 54.0% and 65.0% respectively.","Smadja proposes a method of finding translation patterns of continuous as well as discontinuous collocations between English and French [Smadja 96]. The method first extracts meaningful collocations in the source language(English) in advance by the XTRACT system. Then, aligned corpora are statistically analized for finding the corresponding collocation patterns in the target language(French). To avoid possible combinational explosion, some heuristics is introduced to filter implausible correspondences.","Getting translation pairs of complex expression is of great importance especially for technical domains where most domain specific terminologies appear as complex nouns.

Both Japanese and English texts are analyzed morphologically.","We make use of two types of co-occurrences: Word co-occurrences within each language corpus and corresponding co-occurrences of those in the parallel corpus. In the current setting, all words and word sequences of two or more occurrences are taken into account. Since frequent co-occurrence suggests higher plausibility of correspondence, we set a similarity measure that takes co-occurrence frequencies into consideration. Deciding the similarity measure in this way reduces the computational overhead in the later processes. If every possible correspondence of word sequences is to be calculated, the combination is large. Since high similarity value is supported by high co-occurrence frequency, a gradual strategy can be taken by setting a threshold value for the similarity and by iteratively lowering it. Though our method does not assume any bilingual dictionary in advance, once words or word sequences are identified in an earlier stage, they are regarded as decisive entries of the translation dictionary. Such translation pairs are taken away from the co-occurrence data, then only the remaining word sequences need be taken into consideration in the subsequent iterative steps. Next section describes the details of the algorithm."]},{"title":"4 The Algorithm","paragraphs":["The step numbering of the following procedure corresponds to the numbers appearing in Figure 1.

All content words of two or more occurrences are extracted. Then, word sequences of length two that are headed by a previously extracted word are extracted, provided they appear at least twice in the corpus. In the same way, a word sequence w of length i + 1 is taken into consideration only when its prefix of length i has been extracted and w appears at least twice in the corpus. This process is repeated until no new word sequences are obtained. The subsequent steps handle only those extracted word sequences. It would be natural to set a maximum length for the candidate word sequences, which we really have it be between 5 and 10 in the experiments.","3.
