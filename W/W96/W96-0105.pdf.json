To construct a practical size database, a considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation is required. Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of the training utility: the degree to which each example is informative for future example selection when used for the training of the system. The system progressively collects examples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the effectivity of our method through experiments on about one thousand sentences. Compared to experiments with random example selection, our method reduced the overhead without the degeneration of the performance of the system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word sense disambiguation is a crucial task in many NLP applications, such as machine translation [1], parsing [14, 16] and text retrieval [10,"]},{"title":"23].","paragraphs":["Given the growing utilization of machine readable texts, word sense disambiguation techniques have been variously used in corpus-based approaches [1, 3, 5, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24]. Unlike rule-based approaches, corpus-based approaches release us from the task of generalizing observed phenomena in order to disambiguate word senses. Our system is based on such an approach, or more precisely it is based on an example-based approach [5]. Since this approach requires a certain number of examples of disambiguated verbs, we have to carry out this task manually, that is, we disambiguate verbs appearing in a corpus prior to their use by the system. A preliminary experiment on ten Japanese verbs showed that the system needed on average about one hundred examples for each verb in order to achieve 82% of accuracy in disambiguating verb senses. In order to build an operational system, the following problems have to be taken into account:","1. Since there are about one thousand basic verbs in Japanese, a considerable overhead is associated with manual word sense disambiguation.","2. Given human resource limitations, it is not reasonable to manually analyze large corpora as they can provide virtually infinite input.","3. Given the fact that example-based natural language systems, including our system, search the example-database (database, hereafter) for the most similar examples with regard to the input, the computational cost becomes prohibitive if one works with a very large database size [11]. 56 All these problems suggest a different approach, namely to select a small number of optimally informative examples from a given corpora. Hereafter we will call these examples \"samples.\"","Our method, based on the utility maximization principle, decides on which examples should be included in the database. This decision procedure is usually called selective sampling. Selective sampling directly addresses the first two problems mentioned above. The overall control flow of systems based on selective sampling can be depicted as in figure 1, where \"system\" refers to dedicated NLP applications. The sampling process basically cycles between the execution and the training phases. During the execution phase, the system generates an interpretation for each example, in terms of parts-of-speech, text categories or word senses. During the training phase, the system selects samples for training from the previously produced outputs. During this phase, a human expert provides the correct interpretation of the samples so that the system can then be trained for the execution of the remaining data. Several researchers have proposed such an approach. ... ...... training phase ..","I Â• correct interpretation",", [human I \",","..I. ....... .......... /~'1 ij I y ....... ~ I [ ......... , .~-------'r'-.-... , , I (f_-l-..~.....~ ..","\"\"\"-.. ..... outputs.] .... ..-'\"\" ......... execution phase ........... Figure 1: Flow of control of the example sampling system","Lewis et al. proposed an example sampling method for statistics-based text classification [13]. In this method, the system always selects samples which are not certain with respect to the correctness of the answer. Dagan et al. proposed a committee-based sampling method, which is currently applied to HMM training for part-of-speech tagging [2]. This method selects samples based on the training utility factor of the examples, i.e. the informativity of the data with respect to future training. However, as all these methods are implemented for statistics-based models, there is a need to explore how to formalize and map these concepts into the example-based approach.","With respect to problem 3, a possible solution would be the generalization of redundant examples [8, 19]. However, such an approach implies a significant overhead for the manual training of each example prior to the generalization. This shortcoming is precisely what our approach allows to avoid: reducing both the overhead as well as the size of the database.","Section 2 briefly describes our method for a verb sense disambiguation system. The next Section 3 elaborates on the example sampling method, while section 4 reports on the results of our experiment.

Figure 2 shows a fragment of the entry associated with the Japanese verb toru. As with most words, the verb toru has multiple senses, a sample of which are \"to take/steal,\" \"to attain,\" \"to subscribe\" and \"to reserve.\" The database specifies the case frame(s) associated with each verb sense. In Japanese, a complement of a verb consists of a noun phrase (case filler) and its case marker suffix, for example ga (nominative) or o (accusative). The database lists several case filler examples for each case. The task of the system is \"to interpret\" the verbs occurring in the input text, i.e. to choose one sense from among a set of candidates. All verb senses we use are defined in \"IPAL\" [7], a machine readable dictionary. IPAL also contains example case fillers as shown in figure 2. Given an input, in our case a simple sentence, the system identifies the verb sense on the basis of the scored similarity between the input and the examples given for each verb sense. Let us take as an example the sentence below:","hisho ga shindaisha o toru. (secretary-NOM) (sleeping car-ACC) (?) In this example, one may consider hisho (\"secretary\") and shindaisha (\"sleeping car\") to be semantically similar to joshu (\"assistant\") and hikSki (\"airplane\") respectively, and since both collocate with the \"to reserve\" sense of toru one could infer that toru may be interpreted as \"to reserve.\" The similarity between two different case fillers is estimated according to the length of the path between them in a thesaurus. Our current experiments are based around the Japanese word thesaurus Bunruigoihyo [17]. Figure 3 shows a fragment of Bunruigoihyo including some of the nouns in both figure 2 and the example sentence above, with each word corresponding to a leaf in the structure of the thesaurus. As with most thesauri, the length of the path between two terms in Bunruigoihyo is expected to reflect their relative similarity. In B8 table 1, we show our measure of similarity, based on the length of the path between two terms, as proposed by Kurohashi et al [12]."]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["kare kanojo"]},{"title":"I I I I I","paragraphs":["otoko joshu hisho shinbun zasshi kane heya kippu uma Figure 3: A fragment of Bunruigoihyo","Furthermore, since the restrictions imposed by the case fillers in choosing the verb sense are not equally selective, we consider a weighted case contribution to the disambiguation (CCD) of the verb senses. This CCD factor is taken into account when computing the score of a verb's sense. Consider again the case of toru in figure 2. Since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization in a semantic sense (in figure 2, the nominative of each verb sense displays the same general concept, i.e. animate), it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly interpret the verb sense based on the similarity in the nominative. In contrast, since the ranges are diverse in the accusative, it would be feasible to rely more strongly on the similarity here.

In the accusative, however, \"y\" would be properly estimated to belong to the set of \"l\"s due to the mutual independence of the two accusative case filler sets, even though examples did not fully cover each of the ranges of \"l\"s and \"2\"s. Note that this difference would be critical if example data were sparse.

In this diagram, \"outputs\" refers to a corpus in which each sentence is assigned the proper interpretation of the verb during the execution phase. In the \"training\" phase, the system stores samples of manually disambiguated verb senses (simply checked or appropriately corrected by a human) in the database to be later used in a new execution phase. This is the issue we turn to in this section.","Lewis et al. proposed the notion of uncertain example sampling for the training of statistics-based text classifiers [13]. Their method selects those examples that the system classifies (in this case, matching a text category) with minimum certainty. This method is based on the assumption that there is no need for teaching the system the correct answer when it answered with high certainty. However, we should take into account the training effect a given example has on other examples. In other words, by selecting an appropriate example as a sample, we can get more correct examples in the next cycle of iteration. In consequence, the number of examples to be taught will decrease. We consider maximization of this effect by means of a training utility function (TUF) aiming at ensuring that the example with the highest training utility figure, is the most useful example at a given point in time.","Let S be a set of sentences, i.e. a given corpus, and T be a subset of S in which each sentence has already been manually disambiguated for training. In other words, sentences in T have been selected as samples, and are hence stored in the database. Let X be the set of the residue, realizing equation (5).

Ideally the sampling size, i.e. the number of samples selected at each iteration would be such as to avoid retraining of similar examples. It should be noted that this can be a critical problem for statistics-based approaches [1, 3, 18, 20, 24], as the reconstruction of statistic classifiers is expensive. However, example-based systems [5, 12, 21] do not require the reconstruction of the system, but examples have to be stored in the database. It also should be noted that in each iteration, the system needs only compute the similarity between each example x belonging to X and the newly stored example, instead of every example belonging to T, because of the following reasons: Â• storing an example of verb sense interpretation"]},{"title":"si,","paragraphs":["will not affect the score of other verb senses, 61","Â• if the system memorizes the current score of si for each x, the system simply needs to compare it with the newly computed score between x and the newly stored example in T and choose the greater of the two to be the new plausibility of si. This reduces the time complexity of each iteration from O(N 2) to O(N), given that N is the total number of examples in S. 3.2 Interpretation certainty Lewis et al. estimate certainty of an interpretation by the ratio between the probability of the most plausible text category, and the probability of any other text category, excluding the most probable one. Similarly, in our example-based verb sense disambiguation system, we introduce the notion of interpretation certainty of examples based on the following applicability restrictions: 1. the highest interpretation score is sufficiently large, 2. the highest interpretation score is significantly larger than the second highest score. The rationale for these restrictions is given below. Consider figure 6, where each symbol denotes an example in S, with symbols \"x\" belonging to X and symbols \"e\" belonging to T. The curved lines delimit the semantic vicinities (extents) of the two \"e\"s, i.e. sense 1 and sense 2, respectively 1. The semantic similarity between two sentences is graphically portrayed by the physical distance between the two symbols representing them. In figure 6-a, \"x's located inside a semantic vicinity are expected to be interpreted with high certainty as being similar to the appropriate example \"e,\" a fact which is in line with restriction 1 mentioned above. However, in figure 6-b, the degree of certainty for the interpretation of any \"x\" which is located inside the intersection of the two semantic vicinities cannot be great. This happens when the case fillers of two or more verb senses are not selective enough to allow a clear cut delineation among them.

Whether coupling these two methods would increase overall effectivity is an empirical matter requiring further exploration.","Future work will include more sophisticated methods for verb sense disambiguation and methods of acquiring seeds, the acquisition of which is currently based on an existing dictionary. 67","sense 1 / f~ense 2 sense 1 Figure ll-a: Interpretation certainty of \"x\" is small because \"x\" lies in the intersection of distinct verb senses Figure ll-b: Interpretation certainty of \"x\" is small because \"x\" is semantically ambiguous Figure 11: Two separate scenaries where the interpretation certainty of \"x\" is small We will also build an experimental database for natural language processing using our example sampling method."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Dr. Manabu Okumura (JAIST, Japan), Mr. Timothy Baldwin (TITech, Japan), Michael Zock and Dan Tufts (LIMSl, France) for their comments on an earlier version of this paper."]},{"title":"References [1] [2]","paragraphs":["Peter F.
