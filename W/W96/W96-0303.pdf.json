Our approach assumes that attested uses of derived words and senses are explicitly recorded, but that productive use of lexical rules is also possible, though controlled by probabilities associated with rule application. We discuss how the necessary probabilities and estimates of lexical rule productivity may be acquired from corpora."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Lexicalist linguistic theories, such as HPSG, LFG and categorial grammar, rely heavily on lexical rules. Recently, techniques have been described which address the efficiency issues that this raises for fully productive rules, such as inflectional rules and 'syntactic rules' (such as the HPSG complement extraction lexical rule). For example, Bouma & van Noord (1994) and Johnson & Dorre (1995) propose techniques for delayed evaluation of lexical rules so that they apply 'on demand' at parse time. Meurers ~ Minnen (1995) present a covariation approach, in which a finite-state machine for the application of lexical rules is derived by computing possible follow relations between the set of rules and then pruned FSMs are associated with classes of actual lexical entries representing the restricted set of rules which can apply to those entries. Finally, entries themselves are extended with information common to all their derived variants. These techniques achieve most of the advantages of lexicon expansion in the face of recursive rules and cyclic rule interactions which preclude a full off-line expansion.","Although these treatments allow for the efficient use of productive lexical rules, they do not address the issue of semi-productivity of derivational morphological and sense extension rules, which causes considerable problems in construction of broad coverage lexical knowledge bases (LKBs) (see, for example, Climent and Mart/(1995), Pirelli et al., 1994). The standard formalization of lexical rules entails that derived entries will exist without exception for any basic entry which is compatible with the lexical rule input description. Formal accounts of some classes of exceptions, such as preemption by synonomy, have been developed (e.g. Briscoe et al, 1995), but these suffer from the disadvantage that detailed lexical semantic information must be available to detect potential synonyms. The search for a fully productive statement of verb alternations has led to an increasingly semantic perspective on such rules. Pinker (1989) argues that so-called broad semantic classes (e.g. creation or transfer verbs) provide necessary conditions for lexical rule application, but that narrow class lexical rules should be specified, breaking down such rules into a number of fully-productive subcases. But, in the attempt to define such subcases, Pinker is forced to make subtle and often unintuitive distinctions. Similarly, Levin (1992) delimits classes of verbs to which particular sets of alternations apply, but some of her classes are very small and do not have straightforward semantic criteria for membership. Thus, even if the narrow class approach is correct, its implementation is problematic.","From a computational perspective, an equally acute problem is the proliferation of senses that results when lexical rules are encoded as fully productive. For instance, the result of applying the vehicle-name -> verb-of-motion lexical rule can be input to several other lexical rules. The forms which would arise if the alternations given by Levin (1992:267) are applied to helicopter are illustrated in (1): (1) a The pilot helicoptered b The pilot helicoptered over the forests c Mrs Clinton was helicoptered to the base d The pilot helicoptered the forests e The pilot helicoptered his passengers sick Judgements of the grammaticality of such examples differ (though (lc) is an attested example) but even when such senses are plausible and attested, they are rare for the great majority of nouns which could in principle undergo the conversion.","Jackendoff (1975) and others have proposed that lexical rules be interpreted as redundancy statements which abbreviate the statement of the lexicon but which are not applied generatively. This conception of lexical rules has been utilized in computational lexical knowledge bases, for example by Sanfilippo (1993). However, this approach cannot account for the semi-productive nature of such rules, illustrated with respect to the dative alternation in (2): (2) John faxed / xeroxed / emailed his colleagues a copy of the report And for practical LKB building, there is a problem acquiring the information about which lexical entries a rule applies to. Machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) were used for this purpose by Sanfilippo, but the absence of a sense in an MRD does not mean it is unknown to the lexicographer: dictionaries have space limitations and senses may be omitted if they are rare or specialized, and also if they are 'obvious' -- i.e. the result of a highly productive process (Kilgarriff, 1992). Furthermore, if broad-coverage is attempted, the polysemy problem is still acute. Finally, theories of the lexicon in which the consequences of lexical rules are precomputed, cannot be correct in the limit because of the presence of recursive lexical rules such as re-, anti- or great- prefixation (e.g. rereprogram, anti-anti-missile or great-great-grandfather).","Thus neither the interpretation of lexical rules as fully generative or as purely abbreviatory is adequate linguistically or as the basis for LKBs. Although many lexical rules are subject to exceptions, gaps and variable degrees of conventionalization, most are semi-productive in the sense that they play a role in the production and interpretation of nonce forms and errors. In the remainder of this paper, we illustrate how the linguistically-motivated probablistic framework for lexical rule application described in Copestake and Briscoe (1995) and Briscoe and Copestake (1995) might be utilized to address these practical problems."]},{"title":"2 Probabilistic lexical rules","paragraphs":["Copestake and Briscoe (1995) and Briscoe and Copestake (1995) argue that lexical rules, are sensitive to both type and token frequency effects which determine language users' assessments of the degree of acceptability of a given derived form and also their willingness to apply a rule in producing i or interpreting a novel form. Arguments for a treatment of semi-productivity along these lines have been advanced by Goldberg (1995) and Bauer (1983) (though not with respect to lexical rules). We regard our use of probabilities as being consistent with Bauer's claim that accounting for semi-productivity is an issue of performance, not competence (Bauer 1983:71f).","The frequency with which a given word form is associated with a particular lexical entry (i.e. sense or grammatical realization) is often highly skewed; Church (1988) points out that a model of part-of-speech assignment in context will be 90% accurate (for English) if it simply chooses the lexically most frequent part-of-speech for a given word.

Basic entries are augmented with a representation of the attested lexical rules which have applied to them and any such derived chains, where both the basic entry and these 'abbreviated' derived entries are associated with a probability. One way of implementing this approach is to adopt the covariation technique of Meurers & Minnen (1995) discussed above. If we assume a precompiled representation of this form, conditional probabilities that a word form will be associated with a particular (basic or derived) entry can be associated with states in the FSM, as illustrated in Figure 1.

There are a variety of well-known techniques for smoothing probability distributions which avoid assigning zero probability to unseen events. Church ~ Gale (1994) discuss the applicability of these to linguistic problems and emphasize the need for differential estimation of the probability of different unseen events in typical linguistic applications. For instance, one standard approach to smoothing involves assigning a hypothetical single observation to each unseen event in a distribution before normalizing frequencies to obtain probabilities. This captures the intuition that the more frequent the observation of some events in a distribution, the less likely it is that the unseen possibilities will occur. Thus, a rare word with only a few observations may be more likely to be seen in an alternative realization than a very frequent word which has been observed many times in some subset of the possible realizations licensed by the grammar. However, all unseen events will be assigned the same probability within each distinct distribution and this is at best a gross estimate of the actual distribution.","For unattested derived lexical entries for a given word form, the relative productivity of the lexical rule(s) required to produce the derived entry can be used to allow differential estimation 10 I","substance 0.84 agent ire- e _~o~","use-subst-lr ~ instrument-er '0 \"0 tr ns instrument result-lr","resultatlve 0.01 Figure 3: Lexeme for"]},{"title":"lacquer","paragraphs":["the probability of an unattested derived entry given a word form.

Probabilities of different word senses can be learned by a running analyzer, to the extent that lexical ambiguities are resolved either during processing or by an external oracle, and for limited domains this may well be the best approach. We are more interested in incorporating probabilities in a large, reusable, lexical knowledge base. Recent developments in corpus processing techniques have made this more feasible. For instance, work on word sense disambiguation in corpora (e.g. Resnik 1995), could lead to an estimate of frequencies for word senses in general, with rule-derived senses simply being a special case. Many lexical rules involve changes in subcategorization, and automatic techniques for extracting subcategorization from corpora (e.g. Briscoe and Carroll, 1995; Manning, 1993) could eventually be exploited to give frequency information.","In some cases, a combination of large corpora and sense taxonomies can be used to provide a rough estimate of lexical rule productivity suitable for instantiating the formulae given in the 12 previous section. For example, we examined verbs derived from several classes of noun from the 90 million word written portion of the British National Corpus, using the wordlists compiled by Adam Kilgarriff. We looked at four classes of nouns: vehicles, dances, hitting weapons (e.g."]},{"title":"club, whip)","paragraphs":["and decOrative coatings (e.g."]},{"title":"lacquer, varnish).","paragraphs":["For the sake of this experiment, we assumed that these undergo four different lexical rules1: Â• vehicle -> go using vehicle (Levin, 1992 : 51.4.1) Â• dance -> perform dance ((Levin : 51.5) Â• hitting weapon -> hit with weapon (subclass of Levin : 18.3) Â• paint-like substance -> apply paint-like substance (Levin : 24)","The first problem is isolating the nouns which can be input to the lexical rules.

There are several potential sources for semantically coherent noun classes. The list of vehicle nouns was derived from a taxonomy constructed semi-automatically from Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, 1978), as described by Copestake (1990). This taxonomy only included land vehicles, not boats or airplanes. The other three classes were derived manually from a combination of Roget's and WordNet, since the relevant taxonomies were not available.

In other words, trailer here is being regarded as a container or location, rather than as a vehicle.

Of course we could hypothesize that verb formation is preempted by synonymy (e.g. by drive). But, whatever the cause, blocking is allowed for automatically by the approach proposed here, since the probability calculated for unseen entries of high frequency words will be very low (see section 4). Similarly, it should not be necessary to explicitly encode the fact that the conversion rule does not apply to an already derived form such as primer.","Even with a 90 million word corpus, some words occurred very infrequently, and others which were found in Roget's and/or WordNet were absent completely. For example calcimine is defined in WordNet as a type of water-based paint, and is also found in Roget's, but does not occur in the BNC. Even the relative estimates for productivity of rules will be inaccurate if there is a systematic difference between the frequency of words in one input class as compared to another, since infrequently occurring words are less likely to have attested derived forms. We discuss modifications to the formulae which would allow for this in the next section. This effect might have accounted for the relatively 10w productivity observed for the dance rule. However, there might also be phonological effects since many dance names are taken from languages other than English. The results for productivity are only strictly comparable within a particular corpus. It should be apparent from the frequencies that large corpora are needed to find instances of some words."]},{"title":"4 Utilizing probabilistic lexical rules","paragraphs":["The majority of implemented NLP systems have either simply listed derived forms and extended senses, or treated them using lexical rules as redundancy statements. In the introductory section, we argued that this approach cannot be correct in principle, because of the problem of nonce senses. But it is also demonstrably inadequate, at least for systems which are not limited to a narrow domain. In an experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system (Alvey NL Tools, ANLT) Briscoe and Carroll (1993) observed that half of the parse failures were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the lexicon. The ANLT lexicon was derived semi-automatically from a machine readable dictionary (LDOCE), and although the COMLEX syntax dictionary (Grishman et al., 1994), which was derived with much greater amounts of human effort, has a slightly better performance, the difference is not great. Automatic acquisition of information from corpora is a partial answer to this problem, and one which is in many respects complementary to the approach assumed here, but successful acquisition of a broad-coverage lexicon from a really large corpus would lead to a similar problem of massive ambiguity as we see in the case of productive lexical rules. Control of syntactic ambiguity by the use of lexical and other probabilities has been demonstrated by several authors (e.g. Black et al., 1993; Schabes, 1992; Resnik, 1992), but the difficulty of acquisition means that the validity of utilizing lexical probabilities of the type assumed here has not yet been demonstrated on a large scale.","This approach fits in most naturally with systems where probabilistic information is incorporated systematically. However it could be useful with more traditional systems. Different applications could utilize probabilistic information in different ways. For word choice in generation, it would be appropriate to take the highest-probability suitable entry, and, if none are attested, to construct a phrase, rather than apply a semi-productive lexical rule to produce a nonce form. For 15 analysis, the most likely rules can be applied first, in the case of known senses, and since nonce senses are (by definition) rarer, rules will be applied productively only when this fails. This improves on the control principle suggested in Copestake (1992), that lexical rules should only be applied if no interpretation was applicable which did not involve a lexical rule, since it allows for cases such as turkey, where the derived (meat) use is more frequent than the non-derived (animal) use in the corpora which we have examined. The two other control effects suggested in Copestake (1992) are both also superseded by the current proposal. One of these was to allow for blocking, which is discussed below. The other was that more specific lexical rules should be preferred over' more general ones. We would expect that, in general, the more specialized rule will be more productive, as a natural consequence of applying to a smaller class, but the earlier proposal would have had the undesirable consequence that this was a fixed consequence, which could not be adjusted for cases where the generalization did not hold. Thus the grammar writer was, in effect, required to consider both competence and performance when stipulating a rule.","The general claim we make here is that if we assume that speakers choose well-attested high-frequency forms to realize particular senses and listeners choose well-attested high-frequency senses when faced with ambiguity, then much of the 'semi-productivity' of lexical rules is predicted. Blocking can be treated as a special case of this principle: if speakers use higher frequency forms to convey a given meaning, an extended meaning will not become conventionalized if a common synonym exists. This means that we do not have to stipulate a separate blocking principle in interpretation, since the blocked senses will not be attested or will have a very low frequency. And in generation, we assume that higher probability forms are preferred as a way of conveying a given meaning. Practically, this has considerable advantages over the earlier proposal, that blocking should be detected by looking for synonyms, since the the state of the art in acquisition and representation of lexical semantic information makes it difficult to detect synonymy accurately. We can assume, for example, that a verbal use of car will not be postulated by a generator, because it is unattested, and will only be possible for an analyzer when forced by context. It is necessary to allow for the possibility of unblocking, because of examples such as the following:","(3) a There were five thousand extremely loud people on the floor eager to tear into roast cow with both hands and wash it down with bourbon whiskey. (Tom Wolfe, 1979. The Right StuJ~)","b In the case of at least one county primary school ...they were offered (with perfect timing) saute potatoes, carrots, runner beans and roast cow. (Guardian newspaper, May 16th 1990, in a story about mad cow disease.) However, this is not the complete story, since we have not accounted formally for the extra implicatures that the use of a blocked form conveys, nor have we allowed for the generation of blocked forms (apart from in the circumstances where the generator's lexicon omits the synonym). Both these problems require an account of the interface with pragmatics, though the latter is perhaps not serious for computational applications, since we are unlikely to want to generate blocked forms.","The treatment proposed here is one of many possible schemes for estimating the productivity of lexical rules and integrating these estimates with the estimation of the probabilities of unseen entries for given word forms. Other more complex schemes could be developed, which,, for example, took account of the average probability of the output of a lexical rule. This might be necessary, for example, to model the relative frequencies of -er vs -ee suffixation, since although the latter 16 I is more productive (by Baayen and Lieber's (1991) definition), tokens of the former are more frequent overall (Barker, 1996). However, we will assume the simple approach here, since acquiring the average probability of lexical rule output raises some additional difficulties, and we currently have no evidence that the more complex approach is justified, given that our main aim is to rank unseen senses by plausibility. Another problem, mentioned above, is the need to ensure that classes have comparable frequency distributions. This could matter if there were competing lexical rules, defined on different but overlapping classes, and if one class has a very high percentage of low frequency words compared to the other, the estimate of its productivity will tend to be lower. The Â• productivity figure could be adjusted to allow for item frequency within classes, but we will not discuss this further here."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have described a possible approach to application-independent technique for controlling lexical rule application. We have concentrated on sense-extension, but the same machinery could be used for derivational morphology, with the advantage that acquiring frequencies from corpora is easier, at least for unambiguous affixes. Our approach requires some lexical semantic information, to identify possible inputs to rules, but the need for detailed definitions of narrow classes for which rules can be treated as fully productive is reduced (since failure to identify a narrow class will lead to less accurate prediction of probabilities, rather than over-generation) as is the requirement to identify synonyms to predict blocking. The probabilistic approach to lexical rules integrates neatly with existing proposals to control application of lexical rules efficiently within a constraint-based framework, such as those of Meurers & Minnen (1995). Thus we believe that this approach could provide a linguistically motivated and practical solution to the problem of semi-productivity. However, further work remains to be done on acquiring sense frequencies and productivity measurements, before evaluation in a full system is feasible."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aronoff, M.
