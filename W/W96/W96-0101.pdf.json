We build on earlier work for tagging French where we showed that statistical estimates can be computed without lexical probabilities. We investigate new directions for coming up with different kinds of probabilities based on paradigms of tags for given words. We base estimates not on the words, but on the set of tags associated with a word. We compute frequencies of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams of word classes in order to further refine the disambiguation. This new approach gives a more efficient representation of the data in order to disambiguate word part-of-speech. We show empirical results to support our claim. We demonstrate that, besides providing good estimates for disambiguation, word classes solve some of the problems caused by sparse training data. We describe a part-of-speech tagger built on these principles and we suggest a methodology for developing an adequate training corpus."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In the part-of-speech hterature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al., 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al., 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones. (Church, 1992) claims that part-of-speech taggers depend almost exclusively on lexical probabilities, whereas other researchers, such as Voutilainen (Karlsson et al., 1995) argue that word ambiguities vary widely in function of the specific text and genre. Indeed, part of Church's argument is relevant if a system is based on a large corpus such as the Brown corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) which represents one million surface forms of morpho-syntacticaJly disambiguated words from a range of balanced texts. Consider, for example, a word like \"cover\" as discussed by Voutilainen (Karlsson et al., 1995): in the Brown and the LOB Corpus (Johansson, 1980), the word \"cover\" is a noun 40% of the occurrences and a verb 60% of the other, but in the context of a car maintenance manual, it is a noun 100~0 of the time. Since, for statistical taggers, 90% of texts can be disambiguated solely applying lexical probabilities, it is, in fact, tempting to think that with more data and more accurate lexical estimates, more text could be better disambiguated. If this hypothesis is true for English, we show that it does not hold for languages for which publicly available tagged corpora do not exist. We also argue against Church's position, supporting the claim that more attention needs to be paid to contextual information for part-of-speech disambiguation (Tzoukermann et ai., 1995).","The problem tackled here is to develop an \"efficient\" training corpus. Unless large effort, money, and time are devoted to this project, only small corpora can be disambiguated manually. Consequently, the problem of extracting lexical probabilities from a small training corpus is twofold: first, the statistical model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a particular context. In a morphologically inflected language, this argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number of parts of speech, i.e. the ambiguity potential is high. Second, word ambiguity may vary widely depending on the particular genre of the text, and this could differ from the training corpus. When there is no equivalent for the Brown corpus in French, how should one build an adequate training corpus which reflects properly lexical probabilities? How can the numerous morphological variants that render this task even harder be handled?","The next section gives examples from French and describes how morphology affects part-of-speech disambiguation and what types of ambiguities are found in the language. Section 3 examines different techniques used to obtain lexical probabilities. Given the problems created by estimating probabilities on a corpus of restricted size, we present in Section 4 a solution for coping with these difficulties. We suggest a new paradigm called genotype, derived from the concept of ambiguity class (Kupiec, 1992), which gives a more efficient representation of the data in order to achieve more accuracy in part-of-speech disambiguation. Section 5 shows how our approach differs from the approach taken by Cutting and Kupiec. The frequencies of unigram, bigram, and trigram genotypes are computed in order to further refine the disambiguation and results are provided to support our claims. The final section offers a methodology for developing an adequate training corpus."]},{"title":"2 French words and morphological variants","paragraphs":["To illustrate our position, we consider the case of French, a typical Romance language. French has a rich morphological system for verbs - which can have as many as 48 inflected forms - and a less rich inflectional system for nouns and adjectives, the latter varying in gender and number having up to four different forms. For example, the word \"marine\" shown in Table 1, can have as many as eight morphological analyses. word base form"]},{"title":"morphological analysis","paragraphs":["\"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" \"marine\" <marln> <marine> <marine> <mariner> <mariner> <mariner> <mariner> <mariner>"]},{"title":"tags","paragraphs":["adjective, feminine singular jfs noun, feminine singular nfs noun, masculine singular nms verb, 1st person, singular, present, indicative vlspi verb, 1st person, singular, present, subjunctive vlsps verb, 2nd person, singular, present, imperative v2spm verb, 3rd person, singular, present, indicative v3spi verb, 3rd person, singular, present, subjunctive v3sps Table 1: Morphological analyses of the word \"marine\".","The same word \"marine\", inflected in all forms of the three syntactic categories (adjective, noun, and verb) would have 56 morphologically distinct forms, i.e. 4 for the adjective, 2 for"]},{"title":"2","paragraphs":["each of the nouns, and 48 for the verb.

From raw text: a human tagger could manually disambiguate texts. There are some problems though due to the fact that there are always words that are overseen (therefore improperly tagged) or there is disagreement between humans (on at least 5% of the words), 3 and cross-checking by another human is required. In our system, we manually tagged about 76,000 words 1 in this way.",". Bootstrapping from already tagged text: this technique generally consists of using a small tagged corpus to train a system and having the system tag another subset of the corpus that gets disambiguated later. (Derouault and Merialdo, 1986) have used these techniques but the necessary human effort is still considerable.","3. From the baseform of the word: one could estimate the frequency of the analyzed stem in the process of morphological analysis.",". From the inflectional morpheme: similarly, one could estimate the probabifity of the inflectional morpheme given its stem. This approach is often used for smoothing probabilities, but, considering the high ambiguity of some French suffixes, such as \"e\", \"es\", etc, it is doubtful that basing the estimates on the suffixes alone would give good results.",". From unseen pairs of [words,tags]: for a given word, such as \"marine\" that can have 8 possible tags, if only the instances [marine, adj-fem-sing], [marine, noun-fem-sing] are found in the training corpus, one could assume that the remaining unseen instances have a much lower probabifity. This could create problems in making incorrect assumptions on words.","Out of all the possibifities outfined above, none seems feasible and robust enough. Therefore, we decided to pay more attention to a different paradigm which captures more information about the word at a morphological and syntactic level."]},{"title":"4 The genotype solution","paragraphs":["In an attempt to capture the multiple word ambiguities on the one hand and the recurrence of these observations on the other, we came up with a new concept, called genotype. In biology, the genotype refers to the content of genes or the pattern of genes in the cell. As used in our context, the genotype is the set of part of speech tags associated with a word. Each word has a genotype (or series of tags based on morphological features) assigned during morphological analysis, and words, according to their patterns, share the same genotype. The genotype depends on the tagset, but not on any particular tagging method. For example, the word \"marine\" with the eight morphological analyses fisted in Table 1, has the genotype [JFS NFS NMS vlsPI V1SPS V2SPM V3SPI V3SPS] 2, each tag corresponding to an analysis, i.e. the list of potential tags for \"marine\" as shown in Table 1. For each genotype, we compute the frequency with which each of the tags occurs and we select this decision. This paradigm has the advantage of capturing the morphological variation of words combined with the frequency with which they occur. A genotype decision is the most frequent tag associated with a genotype in the training corpus. As explained in Section 4.2, out of a trMning corpus of 76,000 tokens, we extracted a total of 429 unigram genotypes, 6650 bigram genotypes, and 23,802 trigram genotypes with their respective decisions.","1We wish to thank Anne Abeil]~ and Thierry Poibeau for helping the manual tagging.","2JFS = adjective, feminine, singular; NFS = noun, feminine, singular; NMS = noun, masculine, singular; VISPI = verb, 1st person, singular, present, indicative; vlsPS = verb, 1st person, singular, present, subjunctive; V2SPM = verb, 2nd person, singular, present, imperative; v3sPI = verb, 3rd person, singular, present, indicative; v3sPs = verb, 3rd person, singular, present, subjunctive. 4 4.1 Power of genotypes The genotype concept allows generalizations to be made across words according to tag patterns, thereby gathering estimates not on words but on tag occurrences. We discovered that in a training corpus of 76,000 tokens, lexical frequencies are not as reliable as genotype frequencies. In order to illustrate this, Table 2 and Table 3 show convincing results using this approach. Table 2 presents the set of words corresponding to the genotype [NFP V2S], and their resolution with respect to lexicM frequencies and genotype frequencies. The table shows 12 words from the test corpus which, from a morphological point of view, can be either verb-2nd-person-singular (v2s) or noun-feminine-"]},{"title":"plural (NFP);","paragraphs":["the first column contains always the same tag NFP, because of the genotype decision; we learned from the training corpus that at each time a word could be tagged"]},{"title":"NFP or V2S,","paragraphs":["it is 100% of the times NFP,"]},{"title":"0% V2S,","paragraphs":["therefore the noun form is always picked over the verb form.

The word \"suicide\", however, which should be tagged as a verb, was improperly tagged as a noun. Note that we are only considering unigrams of genotypes, which tend to overgeneralize. However, as shown in Section 4.3, the additional estimates of bigrams and trigrams will use the context to select a more appropriate tag. 4.2 Distribution of genotypes Among all parts of speech, there is a clear division between closed-class parts of speech, which include prepositions and conjunctions, and open-class ones, which includes verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Similarly, we suggest that genotypes be classified in categories:","Â• Closed-class genotypes contain at least one closed-class part-of-speech, e.g., \"des\", which belongs to the [P R] (preposition, article) genotype. 5 Table 3:"]},{"title":"[NMS","paragraphs":["suicide chiffre escompte escompte cercle doute nombre avantage pilote peigne doute groupe genotype lexical correct decision decision decision rims rims nms nms nms rims rims rims nms rims nms rims unseen rims unseen unseen v3s"]},{"title":"rims","paragraphs":["nms nms"]},{"title":"unseen","paragraphs":["nms nms nms nms nms nms nms nms nms"]},{"title":"unseen","paragraphs":["nms nms i nms nms nms vls v2s v3s] genotype frequencies vs lexical frequencies","Â• Semi closed-class genotypes contain only open-class parts-of-speech, but behave very similarly to the closed-class genotype, with respect to the small number of words - often homograph - in that genotype.

This class, unlike the other two, is productive. There are several facts which demonstrate the power of genotypes for disambiguation. First, the number of genotypes on which the estimates are made is much smaller than the number of words on which to compute estimates. Our results show that in the training corpus of 76,000 tokens, there are 10,696 words, and 429 genotypes. Estimating probabilities on 429 genotypes rather than 10,696 words is an enormous gain. Since the distributions in both cases have a very long tail, there are many more words than genotypes for which we cannot obtain reliable statistics. As an example, we extracted the most frequent open-class genotypes from the training corpus (each of them occurring more than 100 times) shown in Table 4. It is striking to notice that these 22 genotypes represent almost 10~ of the corpus. The table shows the genotype in the first column, the number of occurrences in the second one, the part-of-speech distribution in the third one, the best genotype decision and the percent of this selection in the last column.

As a result, if only unigram training data is used, the best candidate for that genotype would be JMP, occurring 316 out of 607 times. However, choosing JMP only gives us 52.06% accuracy. Table 5 clearly demonstrates that the contextual information around the genotype will bring this percentage up significantly. As an example, let us consider the 5th fine of Table 5, where the number 17 is marked with a square. In this case, we know that the [JMP NMP] genotype has a right context consisting of the genotype [p r] (4th column, 5th fine). In this case, it is no longer true that JMP is the best candidate. Instead, NMP Occurs 71 out of 91 times and becomes the best candidate. Overall, for all possible left and right contexts of [JMP NMP], the guess based on both the genotype and the single left or right contexts will be correct 433 times out of 536 (or 80.78%). In a similar fashion, the three possible trigram layouts (Left, Middle, and Right) are shown in fines 18-27. They show that the performance based on trigrams is 95.90%. This particular example provides strong evidence of the usefulness of contextual disambiguation with genotypes. The fact that this genotype, very ambiguous as a unigram (52.06%), can be disambiguated as a noun or adjective according to context at the trigram stage with 95.90% accuracy demonstrates the strength of our approach. 4.4 Smoothing probabilities with genotypes In the context of a small training corpus, the problem of sparse data is more serious than with a larger tagged corpus. Genotypes play an important role for smoothing probabilities. By paying attention to tags only and thus ignoring the words themselves, this approach handles new words that have not been seen in the training corpus.

In this approach, they use the notion of word equivalence or ambiguity classes to describe words belonging to the same part-of-speech categories. In our work, the entire algorithm bases estimations on genotype only, filtering down the ambiguities and resolving them with statistics. Moreover, the estimation is achieved on a sequence of n-gram genotypes. Also, the refinement that is contMned in our system reflects the real morphological ambiguities, due to the rich nature of the morphological output and the choice of tags. There are three main differences between their work and ours. First, in their work, the most common words are estimated individually and the less common ones are 8 put together in their respective ambiguity classes; in our work, every word is equally treated by its respective genotype. Second, in their work, ambiguity classes can be marked with a preferred tag in order to help disambiguation whereas in our work, there is no special annotation since words get disambiguated through the sequential application of the modules. Third, and perhaps the most important, in our system, the linguistic and statistical estimations are entirely done on the genotypes only, regardless of the words. Words are not estimated individually given their class categories; rather, genotypes are estimated separately from the words or in the context of other genotypes (bi- and tri-gram probabilities). (Brill, 1995) presents a rule-based part-of-speech tagger for unsupervised training corpus. Some of the rules of his system and the fact that he uses a minimal training corpus suggests some similarities with our system, but the main aim of the work is to investigate methods to combine supervised and unsupervised training in order to come up with a highly performing tagger. (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) compare two tagging frameworks for tagging French, one that is statistical, built upon the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al., 1992), and another based on linguistic constraints only. The contraints can be 100% accurate or describe the tendency of a particular tagging choice. The contraint-based tagger is proven to have better performance than the statistical one, since rule writing is more handlable or more controllable than adjusting the parameters of the statistical tagger. It is difficult to compare any kind of performance since their tagset is very small, i.e. 37 tags, including a number of word-specific tags (which reduces further the number of \"real\" tags), and does not account for several morphological features, such as gender, number for pronouns, etc. Moreover, categories that can be very ambiguous, such as coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, relative and interrogative pronouns which tend to be collapsed; consequently, the disambiguation is simplified and results cannot be compared."]},{"title":"6 Implementation and performance of the part-of-speech tagger","paragraphs":["We have developed a part-of-speech tagger using only a finite-state machine framework. The input string is represented as a finite-state generator, and the tagging is obtained through composition with a pipeline of finite-state transducers (FST's). Besides the modules for pre-processing and tokenization, the tagger includes a morphological FST and a statistical FST, which incorporates linguistic and statistical knowledge. We have used a toolkit developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories (Pereira et al., 1994) which manipulates weighted and unweighted finite-state machines (acceptors or transducers). Using these tools, we have created a set of programs which generate finite-state transducers from descriptions of linguistic rules (in the form of negative constraints) and for encoding distribution information obtained through statistical learning. Statistical decisions on genotypes are represented by weights - the lower cost, the higher the chance of a particular tag to be picked. With this representation, we are able to prefer one n-gram decision over another based on the cost.","The morphological FST is generated automatically from a large dictionary of French of about 90,000 entries and on-line corpora, such as Le Monde Newspapers (ECI, 1989 and 1990). It takes the text as input and produces an FST that encodes each possible tagging of the input text as one distinct path from the start state to the final state. The statistical FST is created from 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram genotype data obtained empirically from the training corpus. It encodes all 1, 2, 3-grams of genotypes extracted from the training corpus with a cost determined as a function of the frequency of the genotype decision in the training corpus. Table 7 shows how costs are computed for a specific bigram and how these costs are used to make a tagging decision. The 9 bigram in the example, [p r] [jmp nmp], occurs 306 times in the training corpus. All possible taggings, i.e. [p] limp], [p] [nmp], [r] [jmp], and [r] [nmp] appear in the training corpus. The sub-FST that corresponds to this bigram of genotypes will have [p r] [jmp nmp] on its input and all 4 possible taggings on its output. Each tagging sequence has a different costs. Let f be the total count of the genotype bigram. Let ft be the number of cases that the tagging is t, for all possible taggings t (in this example there are 4 possible taggings). The cost of the transition for tagging t is the negative logarithm of ft divided by f: -log(ft/f). The selected transition is the one with the lowest cost; the example in Table 7 illustrates the computation of costs with [p] [nmp], the selected tagging in bold.","genotype bigram tagging frequency","[p r] [imp nmp] p, jmp p, nmp r, jmp r, nmp","cost 27/306 2.43","104/306"]},{"title":"1.08 2/306 5.03","paragraphs":["8/306 3.64 Table 7: An example of cost computation for the bigram FST [p r] [jmp nmp].","In a similar way, the statistical FST contains paths for unigrams and trigrams. In order to prefer trigrams over bigrams, and bigrams over unigrams, we have added a biased cost to some transitions. The empirically determined values of the biased cost are as follows:","trigram biased cost < bigram biased cost < unigram biased cost. If a certain bigram or trigram does not appear in the training corpus, the FST will still have a corresponding path, but at a higher cost. Since negative constraints (such as \"article\" followed by \"verb\") reflect n-grams that are impossible linguistically and therefore have an expected frequency of appearance equal to 0, we assign them a very high cost (note that in order to keep the graph connected, we cannot assign a cost of ~x~). To make the use of biased cost clear, Table 8 shows the unigrams [p r] and [jmp nmp] that compose the bigram described in Table 7 and the corresponding transition costs."]},{"title":"genotype","paragraphs":["unigram tagging"]},{"title":"frequency [p r] p 6645/6883","paragraphs":["r 238/6883 [jmp nmp] jmp"]},{"title":"316/607","paragraphs":["nmp 291/607 cost biased cost 0.04 1.04 3.36 4.36"]},{"title":"0.65 1.65","paragraphs":["0.73 1.73 Table 8: An example of biased cost for the unigram sub-FST's [p r] and [jmp nmp].","Figure 2 presents the FST that corresponds to Table 7 and Table 8.

The corresponding paths through the FST are shown in Figure 2. In the first case (bigrams), the tagging of [p], [nmp] is at a cost of 1.08, whereas in the other case (unigrams), the cheapest path or the lowest cost includes the two transitions [p] and limp] for a total cost of 1.04 + 1.65 = 2.69. In this case, not only do bigrams have precedence over unigrams, but the choice of the tagging sequence [p], [nmp] is also better than the sequence [p] [jmp], as it takes into account the context information. Similarly, if a trigram contained a bigram as a sub-FST, typically the cost of going through the trigram would be smaller than the cost of going through a bigram and a unigram. In the case where two consecutive genotype unigrams do not compose a bigram seen in the training corpus, there is no context information that can be applied and only the information of the tagging of the individual unigrams is used.","The tagger is based on a tagset of 72 parts of speech. As said earlier, the training corpus was manually tagged and contained 76,000 words. The test corpus, also manually tagged, contained 1,500 words. Taking into account the large number of parts of speech, the tagger disambiguates correctly about 95% of unrestricted text. We are in the process of improving the tagger performance in refining rules and biased costs."]},{"title":"'7 Steps for building an optimal training corpus","paragraphs":["This section explains the motivations of our claims for developing taggers for a language.

The more tags, the harder the estimation of probabilities, and the sparser the data. Having a concise set of tags is therefore a priority. 11","4. Obtain maximum genotype coverage: genotypes must first be separated into closed, semi-closed, and open class. Then, the first two classes must be exhaustively covered since their number is relatively small. Last, open-class genotypes should be examined by order of frequency; since their number is finite, they can also be exhaustively covered.","5. Capture contextual probabilities: genotypes must be considered in context. As described in Section 4.3, bigram and trigram genotypes give accurate estimates of the morpho-syntactic variations of the language.","We believe that concentrating efforts on these issues will allow part-of-speech tagger developers to optimize time and effort in order to develop adequate basic training material."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We explored the morpho-syntactic ambiguities of a language, basing our experiments on French. Several ways to estimate lexical probabilities were discussed and a new paradigm, the genotype, was presented. This paradigm has the advantage to capture the morphological variation of words along with the frequency at which they occur. A methodology is presented in order to optimize the construction of a restricted training corpus for developing taggers. In order to disambiguate word part-of-speech with a small training corpus, genotypes turn out to be much easier to model than the words themselves. They offer a successful solution to the small training corpus problem as well as to the problem of data sparsness. Compared to lexical probabilities, they give much more reliable accounts, since only 429 genotypes need to be estimated instead of 10,696 words for lexical probabilities. Results are even more convincing when genotypes are used in context and bigrams and trigrams are applied to disambiguate. Additionally, they are used for smoothing which is a particularly important issue in the context of small training corpus."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Lalit R. Bahl and Robert L.
