We use texts which are not explicitly structured. A text structure is identified by measuring the similarity between segments comprising the text and its title. It is shown that a text structure thus identified gives a good clue to finding out parts of the text most relevant to its content. The significance of exploiting information on the structure for topic identification is demonstrated by a set of experiments conducted on the 19Mb of Japanese newspaper articles. The paper also brings concepts from the rhetorical structure theory (RST) to the statistical analysis of a text structure. Finally, it is shown that information on text structure is more effective for large documents than for small documents. 1. INTRODUCTION Topic identification concerns a problem of predicting terms in text which indicate its subject or theme. In the past, the problem has been addressed mostly by computational linguists in relation to issues like coreference (Hobbs, 1978), anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lappin and Leass, 1994), or discourse center (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981; Walker et al., 1994). In information retrieval, predicting important terms in document is crucial for an effective retrieval of relevant documents(Salton et al., 1993), though they do not necessarily correspond to the subject or the theme. Predicting important terms involves numerical weighting of terms in document. Terms with top weights are judged important and representative of document.","A spin-off of information retrieval, known as text categorization, shares a similar research interest. Text categorization concerns associating documents with their classification terms or categories (Lewis, 1992). Since in text categorization, categories are determined beforehand in such a way as to meet the user's specific tastes or needs, they may not serve as a topic or a theme in that they need not have a semantic relevance to the contents of documents.","Technically, however, it is straightforward to move from text categorization to topic identification, provided that we are able to somehow isolate themes in texts and use them as categories to be assigned to texts. But the problem with using text categorization for topic identification, is that categories are arbitrarily given by humans, with no regard for documents that are to be classified. There is thus always a danger of misrepresenting documents. One possible way out is to choose categories not from outside of the documents but from within. The feasibility of the idea is explored in the paper.","The use of text structure in information retrieval was motivated by the need for dealing with large documents, whose breadth of vocabulary may easily mislead the retrieval system into making a wrong 101 judgement about their relevancy to the query. Indeed, a new area of research known as"]},{"title":"passage retrieval","paragraphs":["has emerged to explore methods for using information from various levels of a document's structure, e.g. sentences, sections, paragraphs, and other semantically or rhetorically motivated textual units.

Section 3 discusses a problem that the proposed method shows poor performance on large documents. Section 4 is a response to the problem: we propose the use of information on text structure to reduce irrelevancy in the document and increase effectiveness. In Section 5, we conduct a set of experiments to determine whether the use of text structure has a positive effect on the performance. 2. APPROACH TO TOPIC IDENTIFICATION Topic identification concerns the problem of identifying a topic of text with no information being given on the text's title or keywords whatsoever. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to the problem. We start with the definition of topic. Here we simply assume that a title term, or a noun that appears in the title, counts as a topic for the text. The reason is that it gives a clear cut, if not simple-minded, definition of topic and lends itself easily to a statistical treatment. Thus what is involved in identifying a topic is a task of locating an instance of a title term. One might ask how we might locate an instance of topic without any information on the title or keywords. We take a probabilistic approach where you estimate the likelihood that a noun appears as a title term and choose among the best scoring nouns. Although it is quite possible to expand the notion of 'topic' to include nouns semantically related to title terms, the possibility is not explored here.","The method we use for topic identification is basically one that is standardly used in research on text categorization, which aims at finding an effective way of classifying documents with predefined categories (Lewis, 1992). Roughly speaking, text categorization proceeds in two steps; first, for each of the given categories, estimate the likelihood that it is a correct category of a document, and second, decide whether to assign the category to the document based on the estimate; the rule is to use a suitable cutoff point to determine a choice.","Now to adapt text categorization for use in topic identification requires a slight change in the for-mer. This is because in topic identification, we want to assign documents to nouns which occur in the document, rather than to categories given"]},{"title":"a priori.","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, topic identification is a two-part process; estimating and assigning.

The vertical dimension represents the proportion of words in text against words in title.) Since the title length stays rather constant over the test corpus, the possibility that an actual topic is identified by chance would be higher for short texts than for lengthy ones; we find 13% of indices to be actual at 100, while the rate goes down to 3% at 900.

METHOD Our approach to the reduction problem above is to use a text structure to demarcate between relevant and irrelevant parts of text. Since newspaper articles in general do not have formal structure indicators, we use some similarity function to discover the structure of text. One such function is proposed by Hearst (1994), where a text structure is determined by measuring the similarity between adjacent blocks of text. Rather than to use a measure for within document similarity, the present approach chose to use a similarity measure between the text and its title to determine the structure of text. Behind this is an assumption that parts of the text most similar to its title would best represent its content. Thus it is expected that discarding parts dissimilar to the title reduces irrelevancy in text, contributing to an improvement on the performance.","Let .T(d) be a complete set of non-overlapping text segments comprising a document d.

Each graph corresponds to articles of a particular length; the one marked with '100-200' means that it is for articles from 100 to 200 character long. Since the test sets we used in the later experiments of topic identification ranges from 100 to 1000 characters in length, the title/block similarity is measured only for the relevant sizes. 't' denotes the number of articles considered.","We divided each news article into a set of 10-word segments ordered according to their appearance. For each of the 10-word segments contained in the text, we measured its similarity to the title. The horizontal dimension represents a position at which a segment appears. A segment at x = 5, for instance, spans the 40th to the 49th word of text. The vertical dimension gives the probability that a segment at a particular position is chosen as most similar to the title. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the initial portion of text is more likely to be chosen as most similar to the title than other parts of text; the later a segment appears in text, the less chance it has of being selected as most similar to the title.","In terms of the rhetorical structure theory (RST)(Fox, 1987), the results could be interpreted as indicating a stylistic norm particular to the newspaper domain, i.e., that the main claim is presented in"]},{"title":"105","paragraphs":["O 0.60.50.40.30.2. 0.1 0 0"]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["x',.\\","I I -- n-",".....","T","--","5 10 15 20","BLOCK LOCATION Figure 4: Text Structure as determined by the title/block similarity. 100-200:t=9595 --~ 300-400:t=7232 --~-- 500-600:t=3944 -m--- 700-800:t=2356 ---~ ...... 900-1000:t=1233 -~- T 25 30 the beginning of the article, followed by supplemental materials.

EXPERIMENTS We have conducted a set of experiments to see how a full-text and \"discard\" model compare in terms of the performance on the topic identification task. Our experiments used the total of 43,253 full-text news articles from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese business daily (Nihon-Keizai-Shimbun-Sha, 1992). All of the articles appeared in the first half of the year 1992. Of these, 40,553 articles, which appeared on May 31, 1992 and earlier, were used for training and the remaining 2,700 articles, which appeared on June 1, 1992 or later, were used for testing.","A training set and a test set were obtained by extracting nouns from the newspaper corpus, which involves as a sub-step tokenizing each article into a set of words. The procedure was carried out with the tokenizer program JUMAN. The resultant training set contained some 2.5 million words excluding stop words.","The test set was then divided into nine subsets of news articles according to the length. Each subset contained 300 articles. In Table 1, the test set 1, for instance, consists of articles, each of which which contains from 100 to 200 characters. The test set 2, on the other hand, consists of larger articles, which are between 200 and 300 character long.","test set length (in char.) num. of doc. 1 100-200 300 2 200-300 300 3 300-400 300 4 400-500 300 5 500-600 300 6 600-700 300 7 700-800 300 8 800-900 300 9 900-1000 300 Table 1: Test Sets","In the experiments, we were interested in finding out the effectiveness of a segment model which considers a starting block of the article and ignores everything else.

The distribution of similarity measurements for large texts in Fig. 4 suggests that the similarity distribution for large texts tend to be less skewed to the left than that for short texts.

FINAL REMARKS Two major benefits of using text structure in topic identification are an improvement in effectiveness and a considerable reduction of the text volume necessary for the correct identification of text topics. For instance, a fixed-length model using the first 20-word block requires only about one tenth of the words that are used in a full-text model and still performs significantly and consistently better than the latter. Contrary to our expectation, the results of the experiments cast some doubt as to the usefulness of paragraphs for topic identification.","Fig. 10 shows a particular implementation of the present method (full-text model), which operates in the Emacs environment. The article shown in Fig. 10 is from Nihon Keizai Shimbun (1992).","As a conclusion, let us mention a few points. The present paper demonstrated that evidence on text structure enhanced the performance on the identification of topical words in texts, which is based on a probabilistic model of text categorization. Importantly, we used texts which are not explicitly structured. A text structure is identified by measuring the similarity between segments comprising the text and its title.
