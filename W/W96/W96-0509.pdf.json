In (lc), Â£ is just an expectation, derived from knowledge about performing a bring action, and from the relation between the two actions -- go","Â• Di Eugenio and Penstein Ros6 were partially supported by Carnegie Mellon Faculty Development Fund # 1-13709.","LIn the appropriate context, (la) could also be interpreted as asking H to bring the ironing board into the basement, where S is (or will be, at the time H executes the action). We currently neglect this possibility. down to the basement is a substep in the plan that achieves bring S the ironing board.","In these examples, the referring expression in the NP is not sufficient to uniquely identify the intended referent, but it is its linguistic context that adds other necessary constraints. This is the reason why we call these referring expressions distributed. To our knowledge, while many researchers have worked on generating referring expressions, e.g. [Appelt, 1985], [Kronfeld, 1990], [Dale, 1992], [Pattabhiraman and Cercone, 1990], 2 distributed referring expressions have not been addressed yet.","Note that the whole linguistic context must be taken into account while generating (lc): this is shown by the redundant and infelicitous","(2) Go down to the basement and bring me the ironing board in the basement.","Besides planning knowledge about the action that a certain verb denotes; lexical knowledge about that verb also comes into play.

However, these verbs differ from a lexical semantics point of view, and different expectations are generated in the three cases. In (lc) H expects the ironing board to be in the basement: the expectation is strong enough that even if a second ironing board is either in sight or salient ill the discourse when S utters (lc), H won't ground a the referent of tile NP the ironing board to the one in sight (although he may presumably ask \"Isn't that tile one you need?\"). In (3a), the NP the ironing board must refer in the current context, by being either visible or salient in the discourse."]},{"title":"(3b)","paragraphs":["is yet a different (:ase: H will either ground the NP the ironing board to the salient one, if there is one, otherwise he will delay such grounding until he is in tile basement.","ill this paper, we describe our first steps to-ward generating such referring expressions. Tile implementation and experimentation are currently underway. 2 Towards a solution Our solution is based on the integration of a principled discourse planner, LONGBOW [Young and Moore, 1994; Young et al., 1994], with a formalism that represents both lexical semantic knowledge about verbs and planning knowledge about tim actions that the verbs de-note [Di Eugenio, 1993: Di Eugenio and Webber, 1996]. LONGBOW is an extension to partial-order causal link (POCL) planners, in which a plan","3Note the difference between referring and grounding: an NP refers in the discourse, but it is grounded to an entity in the world. is represented as a set of partially-ordered steps connected by caalsal links. LONGBOW extends POCL planners by introducing action decomposition. The representation of a plan operator is divided into an action operator, that captures preconditions and effects, and a possibly empty set of decomposition operators: each decomposition operator represents a single layer expansion of a composite step, that provides a partial specification for tile subplan that achieves the parent step's effects given its preconditions. Representation Formalism. Di Eugenio's system is able to interpret examples such as (lc): it infers the relation between the actions in tile two conjuncts 4 and the expectations under which tile relation holds. Di Eugenio's system is crucially based on a formalism composed of two KBs. Tile first, the action taxonomy, stores lexical semantic knowledge about verbs -- the semantic primitives are derived from Conceptual Structures [.lackendoff, 1990]; the second, tim plan library, contains recipes [Pollack, 1986], i.e. common sense planning knowledge about the actions that tile verbs in the action taxonomy refer to. Both are implemented in CLAS-SiC [Brachman et al., 1991], a description logic based system: the terms defined in the action taxonomy are used in tile recipes in the plan library. Among the defined recipes is Fetch. Advantages of the two systems. First, LONGBOW keeps clear track of dependencies among steps by means of causal links. if stepl establishes an effect which is a precondition P2,i for step2, a causal link is created between step1 and step2. If a third step stepa has a precondition p.%j which is identical to P~,i, and if no intervening step has undone p2,i, 5 then another causal link will be established between stepl and stepa, thus keeping (:lear track of dependencies among steps. This (:larity can be exploited e.g., to awfid generating the redundant","4Di Eugenio's algorithm actually works on purpose","clauses, rather than on p~posive conjunctions.","'~LONGBOW, being based on UCPOP, is able to re-","solve such threats when they arise. 34 (2), as discussed below.","Second, LONGBOW allows to distinguish between intended and. side effects: an effect is intended if it plays a causal role in a plan [Young and Moore, 1994]. This is very important from a discourse planning point of view: first, the in-tentions of the speaker have been widely recognized ms flmdaanental in both discourse interpretation and production [Grosz and Sidner, 1986: Moore aald Pollack, 1993]. Second, if H reveals that an intended effect of previous discourse was not achieved, S should try to achieve that effect again; this is not the case for side effects.","Third, Di Eugenio's KR system allows expressing subtle lexical distinctions ms the ones underlying bring and take. It also maintains a well specified connection between lexical definitions and the pertinent planning knowledge. Finally, there is a natural mapping of Di Eugenio's recipe representation to LONGBOW's. which facilitates their integration. 3 The generation process Examples such as (lc), (an) and (3b) can be generated by assuming that the first conjunct is a step in a plan to achieve the second conjunct. 6 Here, we focus on (lc) and on intensional descriptions of parameters: the expectation in (h:) arises because in the Fetch recipe, the initial location of the object to be moved, the basement in our examples, is defined only intensionally.","The parameter depend in INFORM-REF in Fig. 1 -- one of the discourse operators we are experimenting with -- is used when a parameter is described intensionally. If no such dependency exists, a simpler INFORM-REF operator is invoked. In tile Action operator of INFORaM-REF, the actual description for param is computed by the flmction unique-desc.

COMPLEX, i.e. describes a relation REL between param and other objects, INFORM-REF must be recursively called to provide a description for OTHER-PARAM (di). 7","INFORaM-REF establishes two effects: that the agent is able to identify param, and also able to identify depend. Thus, when the plan-ner generates the first conjunct ct = Go down to the basement, in the context of the plan for [3 = bring S the ironing board. INFORM-REFa, s is invoked to generate the description the basement: it establishes that the agent is able to identify tile basement, and also that the agent recognizes tile dependency between the basement and the object to be moved. When planning to generate f3, INFORM-REF,& is called to generate the description the ironing board in the basement, and thus, INFOR_M-REFz2 is recursively called to establish the effects that the agent identifies the basement, and the locational dependency between basement and ironing board. However, such effects have already been established, so this step won't be expanded; rather, the appropriate causal rink will be generated, 9 thus \"explaining\" why the expectation that the ironing board is in the basement comes about. Thus, no redundant description of tile kind illustrated in (2) will be generated. Note that out method doesn't rest on 0/being generated before [3: if the order were reversed, INFORM-REFo2 would be expanded, and INFORM-REFa wouldn't. However, the appropriate causal links would still be established. 4 Conclusions We see our work ms synthesizing several themes: tile generation of referring expressions; the spe-","tin this case, we must avoid infinite regress, that may arise when using relations in deriving referring expressions, as discussed by [Dale and Haddock, 1991].","8The subscript is meant to distinguish different in-stantiations of INFORM-lZEF in the plan.","'aThe new causal link will link INFORM-REF~ and whatever other step would have been using INFORM-R.EFz~'s effects as preconditions. 35","Action Header: INFORM-REF(S, H, param, depend) Preconditions: ~ ABLE(H, idendfy(param)) Effects: ABLE(H, identify(param)) A ABLE (H, identify (depend))","Decomposition Header: Constraints: Steps: INFORM-REF(S, H, param, depend) 3 unique-desc(H, param, depend, dlA...Ad~) Start, '4 d,, SIMPLE(d~): INFORM(S, H, d,), 'Â¢ d~, COMPLEX(d~): INFORM(S, H, REL(d,)),","INFORM-REF(S, H, OTHER-PARAM(d~), d~), Final ,Figure 1: The INFORM-REF operator cific demands of instructional text: and issues of Knowledge Representation, among which the need to represent both lexical and planning knowledge about action verbs.
