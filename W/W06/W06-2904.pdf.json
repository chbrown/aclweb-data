Most of the early work in this area was based on postulating generative probability models of language that included parse structure (Collins, 1997). Learning in this context consisted of estimating the parameters of the model with simple likelihood based techniques, but incorporating various smoothing and back-off estimation tricks to cope with the sparse data problems (Collins, 1997; Bikel, 2004). Subsequent research began to focus more on conditional models of parse structure given the input sentence, which allowed discriminative training techniques such as maximum conditional likelihood (i.e. maximum entropy) to be applied (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Charniak, 2000). In fact, recently, effective conditional parsing models have been learned using relatively straightforward plug-in estimates, augmented with similarity based smoothing (Wang et al., 2005). Currently, the work on conditional parsing models appears to have culminated in large margin training (Taskar et al., 2003; Taskar et al., 2004; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005), which currently demonstrates the state of the art performance in English dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).","Despite the realization that maximum margin training is closely related to maximum conditional likelihood for conditional models (McDonald et al., 2005), a sufciently unied view has not yet been achieved that permits the easy exchange of improvements between the probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches. For example, smoothing methods have played a central role in probabilistic approaches (Collins, 1997; Wang et al., 2005), and yet they are not being used in current large margin training algorithms. However, as we demonstrate, not only can smoothing be applied in a large margin training framework, it leads to generalization improvements in much the same way as probabilistic approaches. The second key observation we make is somewhat more subtle. It turns out that probabilistic approaches pay closer attention to the individual errors made by each component of a parse, whereas the training error minimized in the large margin approachthe structured margin loss (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005)is a coarse measure that only assesses the total error of an entire parse rather than focusing on the error of any particular component. 21 fundsInvestors continue to pourcash into money Figure 1: A dependency tree","In this paper, we make two contributions to the large margin approach to learning parsers from supervised data. First, we show that smoothing based on lexical similarity is not only possible in the large margin framework, but more importantly, allows better generalization to new words not encountered during training. Second, we show that the large margin training objective can be signicantly rened to assess the error of each component of a given parse, rather than just assess a global score. We show that these two extensions together lead to greater training accuracy and better generalization to novel input sentences than current large margin methods.","To demonstrate the benet of combining useful learning principles from both the probabilistic and large margin frameworks, we consider the problem of learning a dependency parser for Chinese. This is an interesting test domain because Chinese does not have clearly dened parts-of-speech, which makes lexical smoothing one of the most natural approaches to achieving reasonable results (Wang et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"2 Lexicalized Dependency Parsing","paragraphs":["A dependency tree species which words in a sentence are directly related. That is, the dependency structure of a sentence is a directed tree where the nodes are the words in the sentence and links represent the direct dependency relationships between the words; see Figure 1. There has been a grow-ing interest in dependency parsing in recent years. (Fox, 2002) found that the dependency structures of a pair of translated sentences have a greater degree of cohesion than phrase structures. (Cherry and Lin, 2003) exploited such cohesion between the dependency structures to improve the quality of word alignment of parallel sentences. Dependency relations have also been found to be useful in information extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Yangarber et al., 2000).","A key aspect of a dependency tree is that it does not necessarily report parts-of-speech or phrase labels. Not requiring parts-of-speech is especially benecial for languages such as Chinese, where parts-of-speech are not as clearly dened as English. In Chinese, clear indicators of a word’s part-of-speech such as sufxes -ment, -ous or function words such as the, are largely absent. One of our motivating goals is to develop an approach to learning dependency parsers that is strictly lexical. Hence the parser can be trained with a treebank that only contains the dependency relationships, making annotation much easier.","Of course, training a parser with bare word-to-word relationships presents a serious challenge due to data sparseness. It was found in (Bikel, 2004) that Collins’ parser made use of bi-lexical statistics only 1.49% of the time. The parser has to compute back-off probability using parts-of-speech in vast majority of the cases. In fact, it was found in (Gildea, 2001) that the removal of bi-lexical statistics from a state of the art PCFG parser resulted in very little change in the output. (Klein and Manning, 2003) presented an unlexicalized parser that eliminated all lexicalized parameters. Its performance was close to the state of the art lexicalized parsers.","Nevertheless, in this paper we follow the recent work of (Wang et al., 2005) and consider a completely lexicalized parser that uses no parts-of-speech or grammatical categories of any kind. Even though a part-of-speech lexicon has always been considered to be necessary in any natural language parser, (Wang et al., 2005) showed that distributional word similarities from a large unannotated corpus can be used to supplant part-of-speech smoothing with word similarity smoothing, to still achieve state of the art dependency parsing accuracy for Chinese.","Before discussing our modications to large margin training for parsing in detail, we rst present the dependency parsing model we use. We then give a brief overview of large margin training, and then present our two modications. Subsequently, we present our experimental results on fully lexical dependency parsing for Chinese."]},{"title":"3 Dependency Parsing Model","paragraphs":["Given a sentence ","","we are in-","terested in computing a directed dependency tree, 22  , over",". In particular, we assume that a directed dependency tree ","consists of ordered pairs","","of words in","such that each word ap-","pears in at least one pair and each word has in-degree","at most one. Dependency trees are usually assumed","to be projective (no crossing arcs), which means that","if there is an arc",", then","is an ancestor","of all the words between","and",". Let","de-","note the set of all the directed, projective trees that","span",". Given an input sentence",", we would like to be","able to compute the best parse; that is, a projective","tree, ","",", that obtains the highest score. In particular, we follow (Eisner, 1996; Eisner and Satta, 1999; McDonald et al., 2005) and assume that the score of a complete spanning tree ","for a given sentence, whether probabilistically motivated or not, can be decomposed as a sum of local scores for each link (a word pair). In which case, the parsing problem reduces to "," "," ","s","","","","","(1)","where the score s ","can depend on any","measurable property of and","within the tree"," . This formulation is sufciently general to capture most dependency parsing models, including probabilistic dependency models (Wang et al., 2005; Eisner, 1996) as well as non-probabilistic models (McDonald et al., 2005). For standard scoring functions, parsing requires an","dynamic programming algorithm to compute a projective tree that obtains the maximum score (Eisner and Satta, 1999; Wang et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2005).","For the purpose of learning, we decompose each link score into a weighted linear combination of features","s","","",""," ","","","","","(2) where","are the weight parameters to be estimated during training.","Of course, the specic features used in any real situation are critical for obtaining a reasonable dependency parser. The natural sets of features to consider in this setting are very large, consisting at the very least of features indexed by all possible lexical items (words). For example, natural features to use for dependency parsing are indicators of each possible word pair ","  ","","","","",""," which allows one to represent the tendency of two words,","and",", to be directly linked in a parse. In this case, there is a corresponding parameter ","to be learned for each word pair, which represents the strength of the possible linkage.","A large number of features leads to a serious risk of over-tting due to sparse data problems. The standard mechanisms for mitigating such effects are to combine features via abstraction (e.g. using parts-of-speech) or smoothing (e.g. using word similarity based smoothing). For abstraction, a common strategy is to use parts-of-speech to compress the feature set, for example by only considering the tag of the parent ","   pos","  ","","",""," However, rather than use abstraction, we will follow a purely lexical approach and only consider features that are directly computable from the words themselves (or statistical quantities that are directly measurable from these words).","In general, the most important aspect of a link feature is simply that it measures something about a candidate word pair that is predictive of whether the words will actually be linked in a given sentence. Thus, many other natural features, beyond parts-of-speech and abstract grammatical categories, immediately suggest themselves as being predictive of link existence. For example, one very useful feature is simply the degree of association between the two words as measured by their pointwise mutual information ","PMI PMI (We describe in Section 6 below how we compute this association measure on an auxiliary corpus of unannotated text.) Another useful link feature is simply the distance between the two words in the sentence; that is, how many words they have between them ","dist  position","position 23 In fact, the likelihood of a direct link between two words diminishes quickly with distance, which motivates using more rapidly increasing functions of distance, such as the square ","dist2 position","position","In our experiments below, we used only these simple, lexically determined features,  ,  PMI,  dist and  dist2, without the parts-of-speech ",". Currently, we only use undirected forms of these features, where, for example,     ","for all pairs (or, put another way, we tie the parameters    ","together for all","). Ideally, we would like to use directed features, but we have already found that these simple undirected features permit state of the art accuracy in predicting (undirected) dependencies. Nevertheless, extending our approach to directed features and contextual features, as in (Wang et al., 2005), remains an important direction for future research."]},{"title":"4 Large Margin Training","paragraphs":["Given a training set of sentences annotated with their","correct dependency parses,","","    ","",", the goal of learning is to estimate the parameters of the parsing model,",". In particular, we seek values for the parameters that can accurately reconstruct the training parses, but more importantly, are also able to accurately predict the dependency parse structure on future test sentences.","To train","we follow the large margin training approach of (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), which has been applied with great success to dependency parsing (Taskar et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005).

First, there are exponentially many constraintscorresp onding to each possible parse of each training sentencewhich forces one to use alternative training procedures, such as incremental constraint generation, to slowly converge to a solution (McDonald et al., 2005; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004). Second, and related, the original loss (4) is only evaluated at the global parse tree level, and is not targeted at penalizing any specic component in an incorrect parse. Although (McDonald et al., 2005) explicitly describes this as an advantage over previous approaches (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), below we nd that changing the loss to enforce a more detailed set of constraints leads to a more effective approach. Third, given the large number of bi-lexical features ","in our model, solving (4) directly will over-t any reasonable training corpus. (Moreover, using a large ","to shrink the","values does not mitigate the sparse data problem introduced by having so many features.) We now present our renements that address each of these issues in turn."]},{"title":"5 Training with Local Constraints","paragraphs":["We are initially focusing on training on just an","undirected link model, where each parameter in the","model is a weight","","between two words,","and","",", respectively. Since links are undirected, these","weights are symmetric","","","",", and we can","also write the score in an undirected fashion as:","s  ","","","","",". The main advantage of","working with the undirected link model is that the","constraints needed to ensure correct parses on the","training data are much easier to specify in this case.","Ignoring the projective (no crossing arcs) constraint","for the moment, an undirected dependency parse can 24 be equated with a maximum score spanning tree of a sentence. Given a target parse, the set of constraints needed to ensure the target parse is in fact the maximum score spanning tree under the weights",", by at least a minimum amount, is a simple set of linear constraints: for any edge ","that is not in the target parse, one simply adds two constraints","   ","    ","  ","","",""," "," (5)","where the edges  ","and ","  ","are the adjacent","edges that actually occur in the target parse that are","also on the path between","and ",". (These would have to be the only such edges, or there would be a loop in the parse tree.) These constraints behave very naturally by forcing the weight of an omitted edge to be smaller than the adjacent included edges that would form a loop, which ensures that the omitted edge would not be added to the maximum score spanning tree before the included edges.","In this way, one can simply accumulate the set of linear constraints (5) for every edge that fails to be included in the target parse for the sentences where it is a candidate. We denote this set of constraints by","","","","","   ","","    Importantly, the constraint set ","is convex in the link weight parameters",", as it consists only of linear constraints. Ignoring the non-crossing condition, the constraint set ","is exact. However, because of the non-crossing condition, the constraint set ","is more restrictive than necessary. For example, consider the word sequence   "," , where the edge  is in the target parse. Then the edge","  "," ","can be ruled out of the parse in one of two ways: it can be ruled out by making its score less than the adjacent scores as specied in (5), or it can be ruled out by making its score smaller than the score of ",". Thus, the exact constraint contains a disjunction of two different constraints, which creates a non-convex constraint in",". (The union of two convex sets is not necessarily convex.) This is a weakening of the original constraint set ",". Unfortunately, this means that, given a large training corpus, the constraint set  can easily become infeasible. Nevertheless, the constraints in ","capture much of the relevant structure in the data, and are easy to enforce. Therefore, we wish to maintain them. However, rather than impose the constraints exactly, we enforce them approximately through the introduction of slack variables",".

A set of solution parameters achieved in this way will allow maximum weight spanning trees to correctly parse nearly all of the training sentences, even without the non-crossing condition (see the results in Section 8).","This quadratic program has the advantage of producing link parameters that will correctly parse most of the training data. Unfortunately, the main drawback of this method thus far is that it does not of-fer any mechanism by which the link weights",""," can be generalized to new or rare words. Given the sparse data problem, some form of generalization is necessary to achieve good test results. We achieve this by exploiting distributional similarities between words to smooth the parameters."]},{"title":"6 Distributional Word Similarity","paragraphs":["Treebanks are an extremely precious resource. The average cost of producing a treebank parse can run as high as 30 person-minutes per sentence (20 words on average). Similarity-based smoothing, on the other hand, allows one to tap into auxiliary sources of raw unannotated text, which is practically unlimited. With this extra data, one can estimate parameters for words that have never appeared in the training corpus. 25","The basic intuition behind similarity smoothing is that words that tend to appear in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. This is known as the Distributional Hypothesis in linguistics (Harris, 1968). For example, the words test and exam are similar because both of them can follow verbs such as administer, cancel, cheat on, conduct, etc.","Many methods have been proposed to compute distributional similarity between words, e.g., (Hindle, 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998). Almost all of the methods represent a word by a feature vector where each feature corresponds to a type of context in which the word appeared. They differ in how the feature vectors are constructed and how the similarity between two feature vectors is computed.","In our approach below, we dene the features of a word","to be the set of words that occurred within a small window of","in a large corpus.

For training, we smooth the parameters according to their underlying word-pair similarities by introducing a Laplacian regularizer, which will be introduced in the next section. For parsing, the link scores in (1) are smoothed by word similarities (similar to the approach used by (Wang et al., 2005)) before the maximum score projective dependency tree is computed."]},{"title":"7 Laplacian Regularization","paragraphs":["We wish to incorporate similarity based smoothing","in large margin training, while using the more re-","ned constraints outlined in Section 5.

We converted them into dependency trees using the same method and head-nding rules as in (Bikel, 2004). Follow-ing (Bikel, 2004), we used Sections 1-270 for training, Sections 271-300 for testing and Sections 301-325 for development. We experimented with two sets of data: CTB-10 and CTB-15, which contains sentences with no more than 10 and 15 words respectively. Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 show our experimental results trained and evaluated on Chinese Treebank sentences of length no more than 10, using the standard split. For any unseen link in the new sentences, the weight is computed as the similarity weighted average of similar links seen in the training corpus. The regularization parameter ","was set by 5-fold cross-validation on the training set.","We evaluate parsing accuracy by comparing the undirected dependency links in the parser outputs against the undirected links in the treebank. We dene the accuracy of the parser to be the percentage of correct dependency links among the total set of dependency links created by the parser.","Table 1 and Table 2 show that training based on the more rened local loss is far superior to training with the global loss of standard large margin training, on both the test and development sets. Parsing accuracy also appears to increase with the introduc-tion of each new feature. Notably, the pointwise mutual information and distance features signicantly improve parsing accuracyand yet we know of no other research that has investigated these features in this context. Finally, we note that Laplacian regularization improved performance as expected, but not for the global loss, where it appears to systematically degrade performance (n/a results did not complete in time). It seems that the global loss model may have been over-regularized (Table 3). However, we have picked the  parameter which gave us the 27 best resutls in our experiments. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the interaction between the Laplician regularization in training and the similarity smoothing in parsing, since distributional word similarities are used in both cases.","Finally, we compared our results to the probabilistic parsing approach of (Wang et al., 2005), which on this data obtained accuracies of 0.7631 on the CTB test set and 0.6104 on the development set. However, we are using a much simpler feature set here."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented two improvements to the standard large margin training approach for dependency parsing.

One extension is to consider directed features, and contextual features like those used in current probabilistic parsers (Wang et al., 2005).
