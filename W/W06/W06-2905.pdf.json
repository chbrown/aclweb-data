Such fragments are often called constructions, and the theories that assign them a central role construction grammar (Goldberg, 1995; Kay and Fillmore, 1999; Tomasello, 2000; Jackendoff, 2002, among others). For construction grammar-ians, multi-word expressions (MWEs) such as idioms, collocations, xed expressions and compound verbs and nouns, are not so much exceptions to the rule, but rather extreme cases that reveal some fundamental properties of natural language.","In the construction grammar tradition, co-occurrence statistics from corpora have often been used as evidence for hypothesized constructions. However, such statistics are typically gathered on a case-by-case basis, and no reliable procedure exists to automatically identify constructions. In contrast, in computational linguistics, many automatic procedures are studied for identifying MWEs (Sag et al., 2002) with varying success but here they are treated as exceptions: identifying multi-word expressions is a pre-processing step, where typically adjacent words are grouped together after which the usual procedures for syntactic or semantic analysis can be applied. In this paper I explore an alternative formal and computational approach, where multi-word constructions have no special status, but emerge in a general procedure to nd the best statistical grammar to describe a training corpus. Crucially, I use a formalism known as Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammars (henceforth, STSGs), which can represent single words, contiguous and noncontiguous MWEs, context-free rules or complete parse trees in a unied representation.","My approach is closely related to work in statistical parsing known as Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP), an empirically highly successful approach with labeled recall and precision scores on the Penn Tree Bank that are among the best currently obtained (Bod, 2003). DOP, rst proposed in (Scha, 1990), 29 can be seen as an early formalization and combination of ideas from construction grammar and statistical parsing. Its key innovations were (i) the proposal to use fragments of trees from a tree bank as the symbolic backbone; (ii) the proposal to allow, in principle, trees of arbitrary size and shape as the elementary units of combination; (iii) the proposal to use the occurrence and co-occurrence frequencies as the basis for structural disambiguation in parsing.","The model I develop in this paper is true to these general DOP ideals, although it differs in important respects from the many DOP implementations that have been studied since its rst inception (Bod, 1993; Goodman, 1996; Bod, 1998; Sima’an, 2002; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Bod et al., 2003, and many others). The crucial difference is in the estimation procedure for choosing the weights of the STSG based on observed frequencies in a corpus. Existing DOP models converge to STSGs that either (i) give all subtrees of the observed trees nonzero weights (Bod, 1993; Bod, 2003), or (ii) give only the largest possible fragments nonzero weights (Sima’an and Buratto, 2003; Zollmann and Sima’an, 2005). The model in this paper, in contrast, aims at nding the smallest set of productive units that explain the occurrences and co-occurrences in a corpus. Large subtrees only receive non-zero weights, if they occur more frequently than can be expected on the basis of the weights of smaller subtrees."]},{"title":"2 Formalism, Notation and Definitions 2.1 Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammars","paragraphs":["STSGs are a simple generalization of Stochastic Context Free Grammars (henceforth, SCFGs), where the productive units are elementary trees of arbitrary size instead of the rewrite rules in SCFGs (which can be viewed as trees of depth 1). STSGs form a restricted subclass of Stochastic Tree Adjoin-ing Grammars (henceforth, STAGs) (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992), the difference being that STSGs only allow for substitution and not for adjunction (Joshi and Sarkar, 2003). This limits the genera-tive capacity to that of context-free grammars, and means STSGs cannot be fully lexicalized. These limitations notwithstanding, the close relationship with STAGs is an attractive feature with extensions to the class of mildly context-sensitive languages (Joshi et al., 1991) in mind. Most importantly, how-ever, STSGs are already able to model a vast range of statistical dependencies between words and constituents, which allows them to rightly predict the occurrences of many constructions (Bod, 1998).","For completeness, we include the usual de-nitions of STSGs, the substitution operation and derivation and parse probabilities (Bod, 1998), using our own notation. An STSG is a 5-tuple ⟨Vn, Vt, S, T, w⟩, where Vn is the set of non-terminal symbols; Vt is the set of terminal symbols; S ∈ Vn is the start symbol; T is a set of elementary trees, such that for every t ∈ T the unique root node r(t) ∈ Vn, the set of internal nodes i(t) ⊂ Vn and the set of leaf nodes l(t) ⊂ Vn ∪ Vt; nally, w : T → [0, 1] is a probability (weight) distribution over the elementary trees, such that for any t ∈ T ,","∑","t′","∈R(t) w(t′",") = 1, where R(t) is the set of elementary trees with the same root label as t. It will prove useful to also dene the set of all possible trees θ over the dened alphabets (with the same conditions on root, internal and leaf nodes as for T ), and the set of all possible complete parse trees Θ (with r(t) = S and all leaf nodes l(t) ⊂ Vt). Obviously, T ⊂ θ and Θ ⊂ θ.","The substitution operation ◦ is dened if the left-most nonterminal leaf in t1 is identical to the root of t2. Performing substitution t1 ◦ t2 yields t3, if t3 is identical to t1 with the leftmost nonterminal leaf replaced by t2. A derivation is a sequence of elementary trees, where the rst tree t ∈ T has root-label S and every next tree combines through substitution with the result of the substitutions before it. The probability of a derivation d is dened as the product of weights of the elementary trees involved: P (d = t1 ◦ . . . ◦ tn) = n ∏ i=1 (w (ti)) . (1) A parse tree is any tree t ∈ Θ. Multiple derivations can yield the same parse tree; the probability of a parse tree p equals the sum of the probabilities of the different derivations that yield that same tree: P (p) = ∑ d: d̂=p (P (d)) , (2) where d̂ is the tree derived by derivation d.","In this paper, we are only concerned with grammars that dene proper probability distributions over 30 trees, such that the probability of all derivations sum up to 1 and no probability mass gets lost in derivations that never reach a terminal yield. We require:","∑ p∈Θ P (p) = ∑ d: d̂∈Θ P (d) = 1. (3)","2.2 Usage Frequency and Occurrence Frequency In addition to these conventional denitions, we will make use in this paper of the concepts usage frequency and occurrence frequency. When we consider an arbitrary subtree t, the usage frequency u(t) describes the relative frequency with which elementary tree t is involved in a set of derivations. Given a grammar G ∈ STSG, the expected usage frequency is: u(t) = ∑ d:t∈d (P (d) C (t, d)) , (4) where C (t, d) gives the number of occurrences of t in d. The set of derivations, and hence usage frequency, is usually considered hidden information.","The occurrence frequency f (t) describes the relative frequency with which t occurs as a subtree of a set of parse trees, which is usually assumed to be observable information. If grammar G is used to generate trees, it will create a tree bank where each parse tree will occur with an expected frequency as in equation (2). More generally, the expected occurrence frequency f (t) (relative to the number n of complete trees in the tree bank) of a subtree t is: E[f (t)] = ∑ p:t∈p∗","(P (p) C (t, p∗ )) , (5) where p∗","is the multiset of all subtrees of p.","Hence, w(t), u(t) and f (t) all assign values (the latter two not necessarily between 0 and 1) to trees. An important question is how these different values can be related. For STSGs which have only elementary trees of depth 1, and are thus equivalent to SCFGs, these relations are straightforward: the usage frequency of an elementary tree simply equals its expected frequency, and can be derived from the weights by multiplying inside and outside probabilities (Lari and Young, 1990). Estimat-ing the weights of an (unconstrained and untransformed) SCFG from an tree bank is straightforward, as weights, in the limit, simply equal the relative frequency of each depth-1 subtree (relative to other depth-1 subtrees with the same root label).","When elementary trees can be of arbitrary depth, however, many different derivations can yield the same tree, and a given subtree t can emerge without the corresponding elementary tree ever having been used. The expected frequencies are sums of products, and if one wants to avoid exhaustively enumerating all possible parse trees surprisingly difcult to calculate, as will become clear below.","2.3 From weights to usage frequencies and back Relating usage frequencies to weights is relatively simple. With a bit of algebra we can work out the following relations: u(t) =    w(t) if r(t) = S w(t) ∑ t′ :r(t)∈l(t′",")","u(t′ )Ct′","t otherwise (6) where Ct′","t gives the number of occurrences of the root label r(t) of t among the leaves of t′",". The in-verse relation is straightforward: w(t) = u(t)","∑ t′ ∈R(t) u(t′",") . (7)","2.4 From usage frequency to expected frequency The two remaining problems calculating expected frequencies from weights and estimating the weights from observed frequencies are surprisingly difcult and heretofore not satisfactorily solved. In (Zuidema, 2006) we evaluate existing estimation methods for Data-Oriented Parsing, and show that they are ill-suited for learning tasks such as studied in this paper. In the next section, we present a new algorithm for estimation, which makes use of a method for calculating expected frequencies that we sketch in this section. This method makes use of sub- and supertree relations that we explain rst.","We dene two types of subtrees of a given tree t, which, for lack of better terminology, we will call twigs and prunes of t. Twigs are those subtrees headed by any of t’s internal nodes and everything 31 below. Prunes are those subtrees headed by t’s root-node, pruned at any number (≥ 0) of internal nodes. Using ◦ to indicate left-most substitution, we write: • t1 is a twig of t2, if either t1 = t2 or ∃t3, such that t3 ◦ t1 = t2; • t1 is a prune of t2, if either t1 = t2 or ∃t3 . . . tn, such that t1 ◦ t3 . . . ◦ tn = t2; • t′","= pr x(t), if x is a set of nodes in t, such that","if t is pruned at each i ∈ x it equals t′",".","Thus dened, the set of all subtrees st(t) of t cor-","responds to the set of all prunes of all twigs of t:","st(t) = { t′′ |∃ t′","(t′","∈ tw(t) ∧ t′′","∈ pr(t′",")).","We further dene the sets of supertwigs, super-","prunes and supertrees as follows:","• ̂tw(t) = { t′","| t ∈ tw(t′",")}","• ̂prx(t) = { t′","| t = pr x(t′",")}","• ̂st(t) = { t′","| t ∈ st(t′ )} .","Using these sets, and the set of derivations D(t) of the fragment t, a general expression for the expected frequency of t is: E[f (t)] = ∑ d∈D(t) αβ α = ∑ τ∈ctw(d1) ∑ τ′ ∈ dprx(t)(τ)","u(τ ′ ) β = ∏ t′","∈","⟨d 2,...,dn⟩ ∑ τ′ ∈ dprx(t)(t′",") w ( τ ′) (8) where ⟨d1, . . . , dn⟩ is the sequence of elementary trees in derivation d. A derivation of this equation is provided on the author’s website1",". Note that it","1","http://staff.science.uva.nl/∼jzuidema. The intuition behind it is as follows. Observe rst that there are many ways in which an arbitrary fragment t can emerge, many of which do not in-volve the usage of the elementary tree t. It is useful to partition the set of all derivations of complete parse trees according to the substitution sites inside t that they involve, and hence according to the corresponding derivations of t. The rst summation in (8) simply sums over all these cases.","Each derivation of t involves a rst elementary tree d1, and possibly a sequence of further elementary trees ⟨d2, . . . , dn⟩. Roughly speaking, the α-term in equation (8) describes the frequency with which a d1 will be generated. The β-term then describes the probability that d1 will be expanded as t. The equation simplies considerably for those fragments that have no nonterminal leaves: the set dprx(t) then only contains t, and the two summations over this set disappear. The equation further simplies if only depth-1 elementary trees have nonzero weights (i.e. for SCFGs): α and β then essentially give outside and inside probabilities (Lari and Young, 1990). However, for unconstrained STSGs we need all sums and products in (8). will, in general, be computationally extremely expensive to calculate E[f (t)] . We will come back to computational efciency issues in the discussion."]},{"title":"3 Estimation: push-n-pull","paragraphs":["The goal of this paper is an automatic discovery procedure for nding constructions based on occurrence and co-occurrence frequencies in a corpus. Now that we have introduced the necessary terminology, we can reformulate this goal as follows: What are the elementary trees with multiple words with the highest usage frequency in the STSG estimated from an annotated corpus? Thus phrased, the crucial next step is to decide on an estimation procedure for learning an STSG from a corpus.","Here we develop an estimation procedure we call push-n-pull. The basic idea is as follows. Given an initial setting of the parameters, the method calculates the expected frequency of all complete and incomplete trees. If a tree’s expected frequency is higher than its observed frequency, the method subtracts the difference from the tree’s score, and distributes (pushes) it over the trees involved in its derivations. If it is lower, it pulls the difference from these same derivations. The method includes a bias for moving probability mass to smaller elementary trees, to avoid overtting; its effects become smaller as more data gets observed.","Because the method for calculating estimated frequency works with usage-frequencies, the push-n-pull algorithm also uses these as parameters. More precisely, it manipulates a score, which is the product of usage frequency and the total number of parse trees observed. Implicit here is the assumption that by shifting usage frequencies between different derivations, the relation with weights remains as in equation (6). Simulations suggest this is reasonable.","In the current implementation, the method starts with all frequency mass in the longest derivations, i.e. in the depth-1 elementary trees. Finally, the current implementation is incremental. It keeps track of the frequencies with which it observes subtrees in a corpus. For each tree received, it nds all derivations and all probabilities, updates frequencies and scores according to the rules sketched above. In pseudocode, the push-n-pull algorithm is as follows: for each observed parse tree p 32","for each depth-1 subtree t in p","update-score(t, 1.0)","for each subtree t of p","∆ =min(sc(t), B + γ(E[f (t)] − f (t)))","∆′ = 0","for each of n derivations d of t let t′",". . . t′′","be all elementary trees in d","δ =min(sc(t′","), . . . , sc(t′′","), −∆/n) ∆′","− = δ for each elementary tree t′","in d","update-score(t′",", δ)","update-score (t, ∆′",")","where sc(t) is the score of t, B is the bias to-wards smaller subtrees, γ is the learning rate parameter and f (t) is the observed frequency of t. ∆′","thus gives the actual change in the score of t, based on the difference between expected and observed frequency, bias, learning rate and how much scores can be pushed or pulled2",". For computational efciency, only subtrees with a depth no larger than d = 3 or d = 4 and only derivations involving 2 elementary trees are considered."]},{"title":"4 Results","paragraphs":["We have implemented the algorithms for calculating the expected frequency, and the push-n-pull algorithm for estimation. We have evaluated the algorithms on a number of simple example STSGs and found that the expected frequency algorithm correctly predicts observed frequencies. We have further found that unlike existing estimation methods the push-n-pull algorithm converges to STSGs that closely model the observed frequencies (i.e. that maximize the likelihood of the data) without putting all probability mass in the largest elementary trees (i.e. whilst retaining generalizations about the data).","Here we report rst quantitative results on the ATIS3 corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990). Before processing, all trees (train and test set) were converted to a format that our current implementation requires (all non-terminal labels are unique, all internal nodes have two daughters, all preterminal nodes have a single lexical daughter; all unary productions and all traces were removed). The set of trees was randomly split in a train set of 462 trees, and a test set 2 An important topic for future research is to clarify the rela-","tion between push-n-pull and Expectation Maximization. of 116 trees.

We rst converted the induced STSG to an isomorph SCFG, by giving the internal nodes of every elementary tree t unique address-labels, and reading off all CFG productions (all with weight 1.0, except for the top-production, which receives the weight of t). An existing SCFG parser (Schmid, 2004) was then used, with a simple unknown word heuristic, to generate the Viterbi n-best parses with n = 100, and, after removing the address labels, all equal parses and their probabilities were summed, and the one with highest probability chosen. 33 trees that best explain the overrepresentation of certain constructions in the data.

In short, the push-n-pull algorithm while starting out considering all possible subtrees converges to a grammar which makes linguistically relevant generalizations. This allows for a more compact grammar (58799 rules in the SCFG reduction, vs. 77852 for DOP1), whilst retaining DOP’s excellent empirical performance."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["Calculating E[f (t)] using equation (8) can be extremely expensive in computational terms. One will typically want to calculate this value for all subtrees, the number of which is exponential in the size of the trees in the training data. For each subtree t, we will need to consider the set of all its derivations (exponential in the size of t), and for each derivation the set of supertwigs of the rst elementary trees and, for incompletely lexicalized subtrees, the set of superprunes of all elementary trees in their derivations. The latter two sets, however, need not be constructed for every time the expected frequency E[f (t)] is calculated. Instead, we can, as we do in the current implementation, keep track of the two sums for every change of the weights.","However, there are many further possibilities for improving the efciency of the algorithm that are currently not implemented. Equation (8) remains valid under various restrictions on the elementary trees that we are willing to consider as productive units. Some of these will remove the exponential de-pendence on the size of the trees in the training data. For instance, in the case where we restrict the productive units (with nonzero weights) to depth-1 trees (i.e. CFG rules), equation (8) collapses to the product of inside and outside probabilities, which can be calculated using dynamical programming in polynomial time (Lari and Young, 1990). A major topic for future research is to dene linguistically motivated restrictions that allow for efcient computation.","Another concern is the size of the grammar the estimation procedure produces, and hence the time and space efciency of the resulting parser. Table 1 already showed that push-n-pull leads to a more concise grammar. The reason is that many potential elementary trees receive a score (and weight) 0. More generally, push-n-pull generates extremely tilted score distributions, which allows for even more compact but highly accurate approximations. In table 2 we show, for the d = 4 grammar of gure 1, that a 10-fold reduction of the grammar size by pruning elementary trees with low scores, leads only to a small decrease in the LP and LR measures.","Another interesting question is if and how the current algorithm can be extended to the full class of Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammars (Schabes, 1992; Resnik, 1992). With the added operation of adjunction, equation (8) is not valid anymore. Given the computational complexities that it already gives rise to, however, it seems that issue of linguistically motivated restrictions (other than lexicaliza-tion) should be considered rst. Finally, given that the current approach is dependent on the availability of a large annotated corpus, an important question is if and how it can be extended to work with un-labeled data. That is, can we transform the push-n-pull algorithm to perform the unsupervised learning of STSGs? Although most work on unsupervised grammar learning concerns SCFGs (including some of our own (Zuidema, 2003)) it is interesting to note that much of the evidence for construction grammar in fact comes from the language acquisition literature (Tomasello, 2000)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Theoretical linguistics has long strived to account for the unbounded productivity of natural language syntax with as few units and rules of combination as possible.

For use in the current implementation, the parse trees have been converted to Chomsky Normal Form (all occurrences of A → B, B → ω are replaced by A → ω; all occurrences of A → BCω are replaced by A → BA∗, A∗ → Cω), all non-terminal labels are made unique for a particular parse tree (address labeling not shown) and all top nodes are replaced by the non-terminal TOP. Listed are the elementary trees of the induced STSG with for each tree the score, the weight and the frequency with which it occurs in the training set. 35 corpus is generated by an STSG, and by inferring the properties of that underlying STSG. Given our best guess of the STSG that generated the data, we can start to ask questions like: which subtrees are overrepresented in the corpus? Which correlations are so strong that it is reasonable to think of the cor-related phrases as a single unit? We presented a new algorithm for estimating weights of an STSG from a corpus, and reported promising empirical results on a small corpus."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The author is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research (Exacte Wetenschappen), project number 612.066.405.
