These predictions are compared with the Minnesota association norms for 100 stimulus words.

These associative responses have been explained in psychology by the principle of learning by contiguity: \"Objects once experienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of them is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequence or coexistence as before. This statement we may name the law of mental association by contiguity.\" (William James, 1890, p. 561).","When the association experiment is conducted with many subjects, tables are obtained which list the frequencies of particular responses to the stimulus words. These tables are called association norms. Many studies in psychology give evidence that there is a relation between the perception, learning and forgetting of verbal material and the associations between words.","If we assume that word-associations determine language production, then it should be possible to estimate the strength of an associative relation between two words on the basis of the relative frequencies that these words co-occur in texts. Church et al. (1989), Wettler & Rapp (1989) and Church & Hanks (1990) describe algorithms which do this. However, the validity of these algorithms has not been tested by systematic comparisons with associations of human subjects. This paper describes such a comparison and shows that corpus-based computations of word associations are similar to association norms collected from human subjects.","According to the law of association by contiguity, the association strength between two words should be a function of the relative frequency of the two words being perceived together, i.e. the relative frequency of the two words occuring together. Further more, the association strength between words should determine word selection during language or speech production: Only those words can be uttered or written down which associativeiy come to mind. If this assumption holds, then it should be possible to predict word associations from the common occurences of words in texts.

They have the advantage that translations of the stimulus words were also given to German subjects (Russell & Meseck, 1959, and RusseLl, 1970) so that our model could be tested for English as well as for German.","The Russell & Jenkins association norms, also referred to as the Minnesota word association norms, were collected in 1952. The I00 stimulus words from the Kent-Rosanoff word association test (Kent ~ Rosanoff, 1910) were presented to 1008 students of two large introductory psychology classes at the University of Minnesota. The subjects were instructed, to write after each word \"the first word that it makes you think of'. Seven years later, Russell","Meseck (1959) repeated the same experiment in Germany with a carefully translated list of the stimulus words. The subjects were 331 students and pupils from the area near W~rzburg. The quantitative results reported on later will be based on comparisons with these norms. 85","The American as well as the German association norms were collected more than 30 years ago. The texts Which were used to simulate these associations are more recent. One might expect therefore that this discrepancy will impair the agreement between the observed and the predicted responses. Better predictions might be attained if the observed associations had been produced by the same subjects as the texts from which the predictions are computed. However, such a procedure is hardly realizable, and our results will show that despite these discrepancies associations to common words can be predicted successfully."]},{"title":"4 Text corpora","paragraphs":["In order to get reliable estimates of the co-occurences of words, large text corpora have to be used.

Since the associations were computed from co-occurences of words in texts, this preference of syntagmatic associations is not surprising. It is remarkable, instead, that many associations usually considered to be paradigmatic are predicted correctly. Examples include man -- woman, black ~ white and bitter ~ sweet. We believe, however, that the tendency to prefer syntagmatic associations can be reduced by not counting co-occurences found within collocations. Equivalently, the association strength between word pairs always occuring together in a strict formation (separated by a constant number of other words) could be reduced.","When going from English to German, the parameters /~ and '7 in equation 6 needed to be readjusted in such a way, that less frequent words obtained a better chance to be associated. This reflects the fact, that there is more variation in the associative responses of German than of American subjects, and that American subjects tend to respond with words of higher corpus frequency. We believe that by considering additional languages this parameter adjustment could be predicted from word-frequency-distribution.","In conclusion, the results show, that free word associations for English and German can be successfully predicted by an almost identical algorithm which is based on the co-occurence-frequencies of words in texts. Some peculiarities in the associative behavior of the subjects were confirmed in the simulation. Together, this is a good indication that the learning of word associations is governed by the law of association by contiguity.","Although our simulation results are not perfect, specialized versions of our program have already proved useful in a number of applications:","Â• Information Retrieval: Generation of search terms for document retrieval in bibliographic databases (Wettler & Rapp, 1989, Ferber, Wettler & Rapp, 1993).","Â• Marketing: Association norms are useful to predict what effects word usage in advertisements has on people (Wettler & Rapp, 1993). Muitilingual assocation norms help to find a global marketing strategy in international markets (Kroeber-Riel, 1992).","Â• Machine Translation: In an experimental prototype we have shown that associations derived from context are useful to find the correct translations for semantically ambiguous words. The successful prediction of different types of verbal behavior on the basis of co-occurrences of words in texts is a direct application of the classical contiguity-theory, or, in more modern neurophysiological terms, of Hebb's learning rule. Cognitive psychology has severely criticized contiguity-theory with the arguments that association theory did not produce useful results (Jenkins, 1974), and that associations are not the result of associative learning but of underlying semantic processes (Clark, 1970). Both arguments need a critical revision. Recent work with large corpora as well as a large number of connectionist studies have yielded very useful results in different psychological domains, and the high predictive power of the associationist approach makes that the intuitive appeal of cognitivist explanations is fading rapidly."]},{"title":"References Clark, H.H.
