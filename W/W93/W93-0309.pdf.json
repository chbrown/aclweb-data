Some motivations for the extraction of V-N collocations from corpora are given and a couple of differences concerning the German language are mentioned that have implications on the applicability of extraction methods developed for English. We present precision and recall results for V-N collocations with support verbs and discuss the consequences for further work on the extraction of collocations from German corpora. Depending on the goal to be achieved, emphasis can be put on a high recall for lexicographic purposes or on high precision for automatic lexical acquisition, in each case leading to a decrease of the corresponding other variable. Low recall can still be acceptable if very large corpora (i.e. 50 - 100 miUion words) are available or if corpora are used for special domains in addition to the data found in machine readable (collocation) dictionaries."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Collocations present an area that is important both for lexicography to improve their coverage in modern dictionaries as well as for lexical acquisition in computational linguistics, where the goal is to build either large reusable lexical databases (LDBs) or specific lexica for specialized NLP-applications. We have tested the statistical approach Mutual Information (MI), brought up by Church and Hanks (1989) for linguistics, for a (semi- )automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora. We try to answer the question how much can be done with an untagged corpus and what might be gained by lemmatizing, POS-tagging or even superficial parsing.","Choueka (1988) describes how to automatically extract word combinations from English corpora as a preselection of collocation candidates to ease a lexicographer's search for collocations. He only uses quantitative selection criteria, no statistical ones, his main extraction criterion being frequency with a lower threshold of at least one occurrence of the collocation in one million words. He mentions plans to define a","\"My thanks go to the ldS that made the two corpora available for research purposes, to Angelika Storrer for her steady encouragement and many fruitful discussions, and to Mats Ftooth and Matthias Heyn who introduced me to the corpora tools. 1 am also greatful to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive criticism. 74 \"binding degree' on how strong tile words of a collocation attract each other, which would be similar in spirit to what is calculated with MI. The work described in Smadja and McKeown (1990) and Smadja (1991a.b) is along the same lines as ours, though he uses a different statistical calculation, a z-score, and tagged, lemmatized corpora. Some properties specific to German, however, lead to a type of problem that needs different treatment (section a.a). Calzolari, Bindi {1990) use MI to extract compounds, fixed expressions and collocations fl'om an Italian corpus, but to our knowledge have not evaluated their results so far."]},{"title":"2 Domain of Investigation","paragraphs":["2.1 What Do We Mean by 'Collocation'? Collocations in the sense of 'frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means. From a linguistic point of view, however, a more restricted use of the term is preferable which takes into account the difference between what Sinclair (1966) called casual vs. signiticant collocations. Casual word combinations show a normal, free syntagmatic behaviour. In this paper, collocations shall refer only to word combinations that have a certain affinity to each other in that they follow combinatory restrictions not explainable with syntactic and semantic principles (e.g. hammer a nail into sth. rather than \"beat a nail into sth.).","For collocations that are based on a verb and a noun (preferably an object argument, sometimes however the subject of an intransitive verb), three types of V-N combinations are distinguished for German in the literature: verbal phrasemes (idioms) (e.g. Brundage et al. 1992), support verb constructions (SVCs) (v.Polenz 1989 or Danlos 1992) and collocations in the narrower sense (Hausmann 1989). As Brundage et al. (1992:7) and Barkema (1989:24) point out, the differences between these three types are gradual and \"it is hard to find criteria of good selectivity to distinguish collocations from phrasemes\". Although our main interest lies in SVCs we will in the following not distinguish between i) SVCs (e.g. to take into consideration), ii) lexicalized combinations with support verbs where the noun has lost its original meaning and which belong to phrasemes (e.g. to take a [ancy), and iii) collocational combinations of support verbs with concrete or non-predicative nouns (e.g. to ta/,'e a seat); we will refer to all these cases as V-N collocations. 2.2 Why V-N Collocations? Collocations are well suited for statistical corpora studies. The semantics of a collocation in the narrower sense according to Fleischer (1982:63f) is \"given by the individual semantics of its components, its meaning differs however in an unpredictable way from the pure sum of its parts. A substantial cause for this unpredictable difference is the frequency of occurrence and the probability with which the occurrence of one component determines the occurrence of the other\" (our translation). The unpredictability of a collocation is thus partly caused by the high cooccurrence frequency of its components compared to the relative frequency of the single words. This holds even more 75 for SVCs and phrasemes due to their (parlly) non-compositional semantics.","In German, common nouns, proper names and abbreviations of names starl with an uppercase letter (sentence beginnings are changed to lowercase in the corpus). So the verb-noun pattern was chosen for our sludv instead of possible others, because the uppercase makes it possible to extract V-N collocations even from untagged corpora if the verb is used as the key-word. The results of extracting V-N collocations give good indications how promising the retrieval of collocations would be with POS-tagged corpora. Besides, N-N combinations in German are mainly restricted to proper names, and Adj-N collocations are not as extensive in our corpus due to the small number of frequent and interesting adjectives."]},{"title":"3 Resources and Methods Used in the Study","paragraphs":["Two untagged corpora were used for our study', kindly supplied by the 'Institut f/Jr deutsche Sprache' (IdS), Mannheim: the 2.7 million words 'Mannheimer Korpus I' (MK1) which contains approx. 73% fiction and scientific/philosophical literature and about 27% newspaper texts, and the 'Bonner Zeitungskorpus' (BZK), a 3.7 million words newspaper corpus. Except for the test how results could differ for larger corpora described in section 4.5, where the MK1 was combined with the BZK, the investigation was based on the MK1 on its own, for technical reasons and also because verbs occur more often on average in the MK1 than in the BZK (cf. Breidt 1993). 3.1 Statistical Method and Tools MI is a function well suited for the statistical characterization of collocations because it compares the joint probability p(wl,w2) that two words occur together within a predefined distance with the independent probabilities p(wI) and p(u,~) that the two words occur at all in the corpus (for a more detailed description see Church et al. (1991:120) or Breidt (1993:18)):"]},{"title":"p(2-..v)","paragraphs":["MI(x, y) = log 2 p(x)p(y) Several methods are possible for the calculation of probabilities (cf. Gale and Church 1990); for our purposes we use the simplest one. where the frequency of occurrence in the corpus is divided by the size N of the corpus, p(z) = f(x)/N. Distance will be defined as a window-size in which bigrams are calculated.","MI does not give realistic figures for very low frequencies. If a relatively unfrequent word occurs only once in a certain combination, the resulting very high MI value suggests a strong link between the words where it might well be simply by chance. So a lower bound of at least 3 occurrences of a word pair is necessary to calculate MI. The t-test used to check whether the difference between the probability for a collocational occurrence and the probability for an independent occurrence of the two words is significant, is a standard significance test in statistics (e.g. Hatch and Farhady 1982). The statistical calculations were done as described in Church et al. (1991), and 76 were performed together with N\\VIC queries and the creat.ioxl of bigrams using tools available at the \"Institut f/.ir Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung', University of Stuttgart ). 3.2 The 'Standard' Method Verbs that can occur in SVCs are in the centre of our study because the5' provide examples for all three types of V-N collocations; besides, the chosen 'potential' support verbs belong to the most frequent verbs in the corpus anyway. V-N collocations were extracted for the following 16 verbs (no translations are given because they differ depending on the N argument):"]},{"title":"bleiben, bringen, erfahren, finden, geben, gehen, gelangen, geraten, halten, km72men, nehmen, setzen, stehen, stellen, treten, ziehen.","paragraphs":["Bigram tables of all words that occur within a certain distance of these verbs, together with their cooccurrence fi'equencies, form the basis for the calculation of MI.

We will refer to these with BI6. For combinations that occur at. least 3 times, MI was calculated together with a t-score. From these, candidates for V-N collocations were automatically extracted, sorted by MI. All of these were checked by means of NWIC-listings and classified w.r.t, their collocational status by the author. The classification was in most cases very obvious. If a combination potentially formed a collocation but was not used as such in the corpus it was not counted; a couple of times, where some of the usages were indeed collocations and others not, the decision was made in favour of the predominant case. 3.3 Application for German Corpora: Some Problems Some properties of the German language make the task of extracting V-N collocations from German text corpora more difficult than for English corpora. A minor difference concerns the strong inflection of German verbs. Whereas in English a verb lexeme appears in 3 or 4 different forms plus one for the present participle, German verbs have 7 to I0 verb forms (without subjunctive forms) for one lexeme and additional 4 for the present participle. This has to be considered for the evaluation of queries based on single inflection forms, because in English more usages are covered with one verb form than in German.","Another point concerns the variable word order in German (see Uszkoreit 1987) which makes it, more difficult to locate lhe parts of a V-N collocation. In a main clause (verb-second order), a noun preceding a finite verb usually is the subject, but it can also be a topicalized complement; in sentences where the main verb occurs at the end (nonfinite verb or subordinate clause) the preceding noun is mostly a direct object or other complement, or an adjunct.. A noun to the right of a finite verb can be any of subject, object or other argument due to topicalization or scrambling. We restrict our search to V-N combinations where the noun precedes the verb either directly or within two to five words, because this at least definitely captures complements of main verbs","IWe greatfully acknowledge thai. the work reported here would not have been possible without the supplied tools and corpora. 77 in verb-final position. To find the correct argument to the right of the verb is difficult in an unparsed corpus because of the variable number of intervening constituents.","As illustrated in the la.,~t paragraph the assumption that a \"semantic agent [...] is principally used before the verb\" and a \"'semantic object [...] is used after it\" as described in Smadja (1991a:180) does not hold for German. Therefore, complicated parsing is necessary to distinguish subject-verb from object-verb combinations. The results of V-N extractions reflect this problem. In many if not in most of the uninteresting combinations extracted, the noun to the left of the verb is the subject rather than a complement of the verb (cf. section 4.6)."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation of the Results","paragraphs":["Below, the top bigrams with kommen (come) are shown, and some of the nonsignificant ones (t < 1.65), to illustrate MI and t-scores. Bigrams with the infinitive form give best results compared to other inflection forms, possibly because this form covers lst/3rd pers. pl. present tense, the infinitive and the nonfinite main verb of complex tenses (modals, conditional, future) at the same time.

Following Smadja (1991a) we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all. Recall reflects the ratio of the number of correctly found collocations and the maximal number of collocations that could possibly have been found. The latter is slightly difficult to determine, because in principle this means to know the total number of collocations occurring in the whole corpus. Another possibility, to take all collocations that are mentioned in a dictionary as the maximal number of valid collocations, had to be discarded: a comparison with Agricola (1970) or Drosdowski (1970) is not really possible because the 78 collocations found in the corpus are not a subset of those mentioned in the dictionaries.

Whether the recall number should at the cost of a bad precision be pushed even higher by calculating MI for lexemes (6L vs. 6L+) can be decided in view of the application the data are extracted for. Once the number of V-N collocations is generally big enough, higher significance and MI thresholds can be used in order to improve precision again. MI sorts the extracted combinations in such a way that the collocations are the better the higher the MI-score is (with a few exceptions which often reflect highly significant, but linguistically uninteresting word combinations from one of the texts; this could hopefully be avoided with a more balanced corpus).","In general, a trade-off has to be found between the number of extracted collocations (recall) and the number of uninteresting items in between (precision), depending on the application. The described approach seems to be a good method for corpora with texts from restricted domains, where a special terminology is used which will thus show up strongly against 'normal' combinations.","Very high precision rates, which are an indispensible requirement for lexical acquisition, can only realistically be envisaged for German with parsed corpora (3L(oS) has the best recall-precision ratio in figure 1); otherwise the main advantage lies in a better lexicographical support, which should not be underestimated both for manually built NLP lexica and for printed dictionaries. Lemmatizing does not seem to be always useful, as a comparison of 61+ and 3L shows. Possibly the data are blurred because as mentioned on p. 6 the various inflection forms are distributed differently in verb-final and verb-second clauses, at least in the investigated corpus. Restricted lemmatizing with infinitive (lst/3rd pers. pl.) and past participle for a search to the left, and with 3rd pers. sg. pres./past and lst/3rd pers. pl. past for a search to the right (which is problematic, though) promises to give more precise results, as long as search strategies cannot take into account, the syntactic structure of a sentence.","Work is currently in progress to calculate trigrams to check for prepositions in SVCs or for specific (or no) determiners for phrasemes. This will give indications to distinguish SVCs and lexicalized, phraseological SVCs from other collocations. In addition, we plan to consider the variation in span position of the noun within the searched window in order to distinguish fixed phrasemes from flexible ones."]},{"title":"References Agricola, E., H.
