Our approach is best characterized as an attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of multilingual document generation from a kb as an alternative to MT approaches starting from a source text. Empirical investigations: How useful is RST ? [n the analysis phase of the project we carefully worked through a corpus of multilingual documents: primary focus was on automobile maintenance manuals. This work was supplemented by instructional texts for other technical objects (for end consumers as well as technicians, e.g. aircraft maintenance), software documentation and other multilingual material (e.g. tourist information leaflets). 1","One of the issues was the question whether an RST 2 representation of document structure could serve as intermediate, still language independent level mediating 'between' the knowledge base and the texts rendered ill different languages.","The answer was somewhat of a 'Yes, but ...'. As reported in more detail in [RSsner, Stede 92a] it was possible to assign identical RST analyses to corresponding manual sections in English and German, a result again established in recent work with the French versions. This result is not too surprising given the fact that multilingual technical documents typically emanate from the (more or less adequate) translation of a completely organized nmnolingual 'master copy'.","In order to achieve this welcome 'parallelism' some claims of RST had to be abandoned (cf. [R5sner, Stede 92a]). One point was the question **c/o FAW, P.O.Box 2060, D - 89010 Ulm, Germany;email: roesner~faw.uni-ulm.de 1In addition, we have analyzed a number of German texts taken from press releases","and advertisements, cf. [RSsner, Stede 93]. 2As others we see the 'rhetoricM' in RST as a misnomer (cf. e.g. [Dale, this volume])","and prefer to talk about 'discourse relations'. 106 of 'minimal units' of a,.

In addition to such global motivations other intentions influence the strategic and ta+ctical decisions of 'What should be communicated ?' and 'How shouhl this be done ?'.","The l)rimary strategic intention is 'ENABLEMENT to A(~T'. The best way to t'ultill this is to provide all information that enables the customer to make best use of the product, to maintain or troul)leshoot it, to avoid hazards, etc.. As a tactica.1 issue this information shall I>e orga.niz(,d to enhance nntlersta]tda.bility and ease of a.ccess, it shall I)e pres(,nted il, a. concise manner, but nevertheless l>e complete (at lea.st when ta.king 'norma.l' inferences into account).","Some of these intentions (e.g. ea.se of processing and ul,h,rsl, anding) seem to be 'compiled' into the c(mventiona+l, schema.tized way l.t~ urga.nize maintenance ma.nu;tl texts.

Discussion: Towards a unified view ? Although [Mann and Thompson 87] rel)ort tha.t 'virtually every text ha.s an RST ana.lysis' (p. 20), they fi'a.nkly admit that 'certai]l text types cha.ra.('- teristica.lly do not have RST a.na.lyses'.

No other example of the well known lists of discourse rela.tions seelns to be adequate enough. But what would we gain fl'om such a.n a.lm.lysis ?","We have to look at the example fl'om another angle: the introduction of the anMogy is functional for the writer's intention that the reader best understands on a high level what DOS is intended ior. To put it ia other words: There is no reason based on mere content to talk about DOS and to talk about a policeman directing traffic. Only the pedagogical intentions of making the text understa.ndM)le give a reason to make up the analogy and to transfer the analogy 1):Lck to the main topic.","In this sense discourse relations shouhl be interl)reted a.s rea.lizi,lg underlying intentions and they a.re best discussed as a, 'repertoire' tha.t a.llows to l)ursue intentions. :)"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Mann and Thoml)son 87] William C.
