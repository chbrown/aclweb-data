Similarly, Hwang & Schubert (1992), in their work on recognizing tenq)ora.l relations among episodes in discourse, argue for a \"fine structure\" of discourse, in which temporal relations can be established even among episodes of' subordinate clauses.","This paper points out another discourse phenomenon tllat calls fbr a \"fine structure\" of discourse.

But to hol)(:~ to arrive at an understanding of such texts, an NLU system must entertain the possibility that one or more of the linguistic units involved in the rela.tiou may I)e oMy a clausM complement.","Following is another short passage in which 'but' in(licates a rela.tiotl ilivolving a.n attitu(le report. For this passage, R,ST units axe sufficiently fine-grained. The pa.ssa.ge is of interest to us here because the main clause of the second seHtence, (4.3), is not involved in the relation (what are numbered in this passage a.re RST units):","(4) 4.1 The car was finally coming toward him. 4.2 He finished his diagnostic tests, 4.3 feeling relief. 4.4 But then the car started to turu right. The relation indicated by 'But' is between his relief at the car comiug toward hiln ((4.1) and (4.3) together) and the car then turuiug right (4.4). Tha.t is, ['or tim I~Urp(~s( ' of understanding the relation indicated by 'But', (4.1) a.nd (4.3) ~l.re groul)ed together, which axe iu turn grouped with (4.4). But there are clearly also narrative relations to be rec(~guized ill this passage (e.g., (4.2) and (4.4) are in a sequence rela.tiou), which involve other groupings (.)[\" the clauses. Many (such as Moore ~ Pollack 1992, and Dale, IIughes ,~,, McCoy, Meteer, aud Moser ~, Moore in 149 these proceedings) have noted that more tha.u oue type of rela.tiou ca.ll simultaneously hold among elements of the discourse; we see another example of this here. In discourses presenting attitudes, because they present states, eveuts, a.ud objects as well a.s attitudes toward them, a linguistic unit can be involved in more than one kind of relatiou, possibly grouped with different units.","I used \"groupe(l\" above for la.ck of a completely a.1)prOlMa.te t(,rm from the litera,ture.

Further, I certainly do not disagree with Dale's suggestion that tocusing on those rhetoricM relations that are clearly not domain relations would be a, way to better understand communicative intentions.","Given a rich knowledge base, however, out of all of the possil)le knowledge-I)ase rebd, ions that can hohl among all the things evoked in a discourse, only some are iutended to be picked out as the basis for coherence. (If we allow default inference, the mmd~er of possible relations is astounding.) Hobbs (1979), among others, argues this. As such, certain groupings of linguistic units, i.e., those evoking the things involved in these relations, axe more important than others for establishing coherence. Perhaps the ideal discourse model is one in which the process of arriving at these groupings and associated relations is governed I)y a process of intention recognition. But investigating local coherence directly--how it m;mifests itself in various contexts in naturally-occurring texts, and how non-pragmatic iuformation nfight be exploited to recognize it--could provide important constraints tbr iHteution-ba,sed models."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Bergler, S.
