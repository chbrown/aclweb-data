I originally intended to explore the nn.ture of these inferences in the framework of SDRT and DICE, and show how they go through in some cases, but not in others) The details of this modelling turn out to be interesting, 1)ut not wholely surprising. I will theretbre take the inference-based model for granted, and pose instea.d two rhetorical qttesl.ions that arose whelL working it out. The questions are: first, when is an intentionM relation not a.n intentional r(da.tion?

The stra.ight|brwa.rd answer al~l)ea.rs to b(,: (.'on.~cqu~:ucc(4b, 4c) and Backyround(4b , 4c) (cf. Oberlander [1993]). The (.'on,~cque:ncc relation is an evidential relation, in which the first-mentioned seglnent is taken to supply evidence tot the secolM-mentioned seglnent. It's a different relation froln Evidcn, ec, because the direction of evi(h~ntial SUl)port is reversed. Now: suppose that, like the original Bush example, our Incorrigil~le example lacked the explicit connective so. What difference would this make? The a.nswer is: we would lose the clue as to which of (41)) and (4c) was the directive part (of'. Elhadad [1992:204], who adapting Halli(lay, distinguishes between directive and subordinate segments). Thus, even with exactly the same causal structure beneath it, the argument could be inverted: we could be mentionillg (4c) to l)rovide evidence for (41)), rather than vice versa.. But 'when wollld th(~ argument be iHverted? In Grosz ~md Sidner [1986:201], there is an equivalence between the intbrmational relati(m supports and the intentional rel;ttion Dominates. Under DICE's inference regime, the flip I)etwe(m (,'on.~cquencc and Evidence tracks the flip in the direction of supports. But how can a doma.in rela.tion like supports \"change direction\"? We agree that it's \"not iml)lication\"; but it's not even just defeasiblt: intplication. It's like implicatioll, in that it concerns transfer of degrees of belief; but unlike most implications, there need 1)e nothing \"out there\" to make one direction right, and the other wrong. A spea.ker and hearer may di[:l'er as to whether p causes q or vice versa. Only one of them will he right on each occasion. But if they dift'er as to whether p supports q, they can both be right; it just depends on their individual networks of prior beliefs. And if this is so, supports is not an informatio~,a.l---(lomain---rela.tiol. (:m a pa.r with causes.
