The starting point for the construction of such a text is a set of underlying intentions relating to the actions that U is intended to perfi:)rm. This needs to I)e expressed in the text in a gra.mma.tica.1 and pragmatically eflhctiw; way. Amdysis of multilingmd texts, however, indicates that what is pragmatically eflk~ctive in one languag(, may not be what is preferred in another. Our research has concentrated on the task of delineating which parts of the text production process are open to this sort of variation, and which parts follow directly from the task structure that is the shared representation for all the languages. The multilingual data has enabled us to tease out six levels of representa.tion at which variability can and does arise. This makes the picture, for instruction generation at least, rather more complex than any simple mapping between task structure and discourse structure can hope to apl)roximate. What are the levels it is useful to distinguish? We suggest they are as tbllows:","The knowledge of the artefact A flmctional model of the arteffil,ct and its mode of operation in terms of actions and sta,tes;","The deep intentions The rel)resentk)n of the originator's intention that the user I)erform the sequence of actions that constitute a l)articular ta.sk involviltg the artefa.ct;","The knowledge selected for communication What is to be communica,ted about the artefact and the task that will enable the users to perfornt the apl~rol)ria.te actions, based on a.ssumptions about their cultural 1)ackground, world knowledge, and expertis(,;","The shallow intentions A representation of the goals that the text has to achieve in order to motivate the required tasks; The rhetorical structure The discourse strategy/ies chosen to achieve the text's goMs; and *School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex (email: jmlycO!cogs.sussex.ac.uk) tInformation Technology Research Institute, University of Brighton (emaih donia.scottCg)itri.bton.ac.uk) tThe Language Centre, University of Brighton (email: aflt(@wns.bton.ac.uk) 7 The syntactic structure The syntax expressing the chosen rhetorica.l structure.

This leads us to propose a second level of intentionality, that of shallow intentions, where the 1)articular flmctions to be fiflfilled by the discourse are specitied.

At tile basic level, parallel instructional texts are in some sense 'the same', in that they are intended to achieve the same effect--i.e., these texts are CONGRUENT at the level of deep intentions. However, this level alone is not sufficient to account for the observed variability between congruent texts. For example, we wouhl expect the same rhetorical relation to l)e chosen in each language tbr a given (leep intention, and as we have shown, this is not the case. What underpins the choice of rhetorical relation (among other l)ragmatic constraints) is the intermediate level of shallow intentions: tile rhetorical goals selected for the actual text. Coherence relations are chosen to SUpl)ort these sha.ll()w intentions. The corolla.ry of this is that any analysis of the coherence rela.tiolls present in a text will not reveal the (leel~ intentions underlying tha.t text (its 'message', so to slmak), since tim levels ~1\" va.ria.I)ility w~, ha,w~ d~,scril)ed here (Io m~t a.llow such a straightforward real)ping. The multilinguM data prevents this assuml)tion tha,t the ma.ppings between these levels are simple, since it shows how much w~.riability there may be between one lew~l of rel)resentation and the next for different languages. However, it shouhl not be assumed that the six levels we 1)repose are strictly serially ordered in terms of deciding how t(i present a text ia a. given language. As in any process related to language production, a decision at one level m;ly be inlluenced by fa.cts several levels above or below. With respect to the translation of instructional texts, it seems clear to us that the interface between shMlow intentions and discourse relations plays a critical role in determining the naturalness and appropriateness of the target text. It is highly likely that the nature of the wtriation occurring at this level is language-dependent, with the result that the decisions taken in the l)roduction of the source text may not be al)l)ropriate for the target. As far as we km:)w, this level of representation is not exploited in current MT systems. Our data suggest that capturing the variability between congruent texts is a rich area for investigation, and one that sheds light on the levels of intention and rhetoric that underpin discourse. We suggest that such a study not only points to advances in theory, but to advances in MT and M-NLG in the production of pragmatically apl)rol)riate instructional texts."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["di Eugenio, B [1992] Understanding Natural Language Instruct,loll.y: '1'1.-' (\",~ of l:'urpose.
