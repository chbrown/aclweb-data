We first describe an algorithm for converting the hierarchical structure of WordNet [13] into a set of flat categories. We then use lexical cooccurrence statistics in combination with these categories to classify proper names, assign more specific senses to broadly defined terms, and classify new words into existing categories. We also describe how to use these statistics to assign schema-like information to the categories and show how the new categories improve a text-labeling algorithm. In effect, we provide a mechanism for successfully combining a hand-built lexicon with knowledge-free, statistically-derived information."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Much effort is being applied to the creation of lexicons and the acquisition of semantic and syntactic attributes of the lexical items that comprise them, e.g, [1], [4],[7],[8], [11], [16], [18], [20]. However, a lexicon as given may not suit the requirements of a particular computational task. Because lexicons are expensive to build, rather than create new ones from scratch, it is preferable to adjust existing ones to meet an application's needs. In this paper we describe such an effort: we add associational information to a hierarchically structured lexicon in order to better serve a text labeling task.","An algorithm for partitioning a full-length expository text into a sequence of subtopieal discussions is described in [9]. Once the partitioning is done, we need to assign labels 1 indicating what the subtopical discussions are about, for the purposes of information retrieval and hypertext navigation. One way to label texts, when working within a limited domain of discourse, is to start with a pre-defined set of topics and specify the word contexts that indicate the topics of interest (e.g., [10]). Another way, assuming that a large collection of pre-labeled texts exists, is to use statistics to automatically infer which lexical items indicate which labels (e.g., [12]). In contrast, we are interested in assigning labels to general, domain-independent text, without benefit of pre-classified texts. In all three cases, a lexicon that specifies which lexical items correspond to which topics is required. The topic labeling method we use is statistical and thus requires a large number of representative lexical items for each category.","The starting point for our lexicon is WordNet [13], which is readily available online and provides a large repository of English lexical items. WordNet 2 is composed of synsets, 1 The terms \"label\" and \"topic\" are used interchangeably in this paper. 2 All work described here pertains to Version 1.3 of WordNet. 55 structures containing sets of terms with synonymous meanings, thus allowing a distinction to be made between different senses of homographs. Associated with each synset is a list of relations that the synset participates in. One of these, in the noun dataset, is the hyponymy relation (and its inverse, hypernymy), roughly glossed as the \"ISA\" relation. This relation imposes a hierarchical structure on the synsets, indicating how to generalize from a subordinate term to a superordinate one, and vice versa. 3 This is a very useful kind of information for many tasks, such as reasoning with generalizations and assigning probabilities to grammatical relations [17].","We would like to adjust this lexicon in two ways in order to facilitate the label assignment task. The first is to collapse the fine-grained hierarchical structure into a set of coarse but semantically-related categories. These categories will provide the lexical evidence for the topic labels. (After the label is assigned, the hierarchical structure can be reintroduced.) Once the hierarchy has been converted into categories, we can augment the categories with new lexical items culled from free :text corpora, in order to further improve the labeling task.","The second way we would like to adjust the lexicon is to combine categories from distant parts of the hierarchy. In particular, we are interested in finding groupings of terms that contribute to a frame or schema-like representation [14]; this can be achieved by finding associational lexical relations among the existing taxonymic relations. For example, WordNet has the following synsets: \"athletic game\" (hyponyms: baseball, tennis), \"sports implement\" (hyponyms: bat, racquet), and \"tract, piece of land\" (hyponyms: baseball_diamond, court), none of which are closely related in the hierarchy. We would like to automatically find relations among categories headed by synsets like these. (In Version 1.3, the WordNet encoders have placed some associational links among these categories, but still only some of the desired connections appear.)","In other words, we would like to derive links among schematically related parts of the hierarchy, where these links reflect the text genre on which text processing is to be done. [19] describes a method called WordSpace that represents lexical items according to how semantically close they are to one another, based on evidence from a large text corpus. We propose combining this term-similarity information with the hierarchical information already available in WordNet to create structured associational information.","In the next section we describe the algorithm for compressing the WordNet hierarchy into a set of categories. This is followed by a discussion of how these categories are to be used and why they need to be improved. Section 4 describes the first improvement technique: including new, related terms from a corpus, and Section 5 describes the second improvement technique: bringing disparate categories together to form schematic groupings while retaining the given hierarchical structure. Section 6 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Creating Categories from WordNet","paragraphs":["We would like to decompose the WordNet noun hierarchy into a set of disjoint categories, each consisting of a relatively large number of synsets. (This is necessary for the text-labeling task, because each topic must be represented by many different terms.) The goal of creating categories of a particular average size with as small a variance as possible. There is some limit as to how small this variance can be because there are several synsets","3Actually, the hyponomy relation is a directed acycllc graph, in that a minority of the nodes are children of more than one parent. We will at times refer to it as a hierarchy nonetheless. 56","for each synset N in the noun hierarchy a_cat(N) a_cat(N): if N has not been entered in a category","T <- #descendents(N)","if ((T >= LOWER_BRACKET)","Â• ~ (T <- UPPER_BRACKET)) mark(N,NeeCatNumber) else if (T > UPPER_BRACKET)","for each (direct) child C of N CT <- #descendents(C) if ((CT >- LOWER_BRACKET)","(CT <-UPPER_BRACKET))","mark(C,NewCatNumber) else if (CT > UPPER_BRACKET)","a_cat(C) T <- #descendents(N) if (T >- LOWER_BRACKET)","lark(N,NewCatNumber) Figure 1: Algorithm for creating categories from WordNet's noun hierarchy. that have a very large number of children (there are sixteen nodes with a branching factor greater than 100). This primarily occurs with synsets of a taxonymic flavor, i.e., mushroom species and languages of the world. There are two other reasons why it is not straightforward to find uniformly sized, meaningful categories: (i) There is no explicit measure of semantic distance among the children of a synset.","(ii) The hierarchy is not balanced, i.e., the depth from root to leaf varies dramatically throughout the hierarchy, as does the branching factor. (The hierarchy has ten root nodes; on average their maximum depth is 10.5 and their minimum depth is 2.)","Reason (ii) rules out a strategy of traveling down a uniform depth from the root or up a uniform height from the leaves in order to achieve uniform category sizes.","The algorithm used here is controlled by two parameters: upper and lower bounds on the category size (see Figure 1). For example, the result of setting the lower bound to 25 and the upper bound to 60 yields categories with an average size of 58 members. An arbitrary node N in the hierarchy is chosen, and if it has not yet been registered as a member of a category, the algorithm checks to see how many unregistered descendants it has. In every case, if the number of descendants is too small, the assignment to a category is deferred until a node higher in the hierarchy is examined (unless the node has no parents). This helps avoid extremely small categories, which are especially undesirable.","If the number of descendants of N falls within the boundaries, the node and its unregistered descendants are bundled into a new category, marked, and assigned a label which 57 is derived from the synset at N. If N has too many descendants, that is, the count of its unmarked descendants exceeds the upper bound, then each of its immediate children is checked in turn: if the child's descendant count falls between the boundaries, then the child and its descendants are bundled into a category. If the child and its unmarked descendants exceed the upper bound, then the procedure is called recursively on the child. Otherwise, the child is too small and is left alone. After all of N's children have been processed, the category that N will participate in has been made as small as the algorithm will allow. There is a chance that N and its unmarked descendants will now make a category that is too small, and if this is the case, N is left alone, and a higher-up node will eventually subsume it (unless N has no parents remaining). Otherwise, N and its remaining unmarked descendants are bundled into a category.","If N has more than one parent, N can end up assigned to the category of any of its parents (or none), depending on which parent was accessed first and how many unmarked children it had at any time, but each synset is assigned to only one category.","The function \"mark\" places the synset and all its descendents that have not yet been entered into a category into a new category. Note that #descendents is recalculated in the third-to-last line in case any of the children of N have been entered into categories.","In the end there may be isolated small pieces of hierarchy that aren't stored in any category, but this can be fixed by a cleanup pass, if desired."]},{"title":"3 A Topic Labeler","paragraphs":["We are using a version of the disambiguation algorithm described in [21] to assign topic labels to coherent passages of text.

The intention is that at the end the highest scoring categories correspond to the main topics of the text. Below we show the output of the labeler on two well-known texts (made available online by Project Gutenberg). The first column indicates the rank of the category, the second column indicates the score for 58 comparison purposes, and the third column shows the words in the synset at the top-most node of the category (these are not always entirely descriptive, so some glosses are provided in parentheses).","United States Constitution 0 16300 assembly (court, legislature)","Genesis","29424 deity divinity god 1 14286 due_process_of.law 28949 relative relation (mother, aunt) 2 13313 legal_document legal_instrument 28934 worship 3 11764 administrative_unit 28603 man adult_male 4 11566 body (legislative) 28321 professional 5 11481 charge (taxes) 28263 happiness gladness felicity 6 11468 administrator decision_maker 28005 woman adult_female 7 10442 document written_document 27643 evildoing transgression 8 10250 approval (sanction, pass) 27514 literary_composition 9 9428 power powerfulness 27203 religionist religious_person","Note that although most of the categories are appropriate (with the glaring exception of \"professional\" in Genesis), there is some redundancy among them, and in some cases they are too fine-level to indicate main topic information.","In an earlier implementation of this algorithm, the categories were in general larger but less coherent than in the current set. The larger categories resulted in better-trained classifications, but the classes often conflated quite disparate terms. The current implementation produces smaller, more coherent categories. The advantage is that a more distinct meaning can be associated with a particular label, but the disadvantage is that in many cases so few of the words in the category appear in the training data that a weak model is formed. Then the categories with little distinguishing training data dominate the labeling scores inappropriately.","In the category-derivation algorithm described above, in order to increase the size of a given category, terms must be taken from nodes adjacent in the hierarchy (either descendants or siblings). However, adjacent terms are not necessarily closely related semantically, and so after a point, expanding the category via adjacent terms introduces noise. To remedy this problem, we have experimented with increasing the size of the categories in two different ways:","(1) The first approach is to retain the categories in their current form and add semantically similar terms, extracted from corpora independent of WordNet, thus improving the training of the labeling algorithm.","(2) The second approach is to determine which categories are semantically related to one another, despite the fact that they come from quite different parts of the hierarchy, and combine them so that they form schema-like associations. These are described in the next two sections, respectively."]},{"title":"4 Augmenting Categories with Relevant Terms","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, one way to improve the categories is to expand them with related relevant terms.

The cosine of the angle between two vectors in the space is a continuous measure of their semantic relatedness.","Lexical coocurrence, which is the basis for creating the word space vectors, can be easily measured.

Two columns in this matrix are similar if the contexts the corresponding fourgrams are used in are similar. The counts were determined using five months of the New York Times (June - October 1990). The resulting collocation matrix is dense: only 2% of entries are zeros, because almost any two fourgrams cooccur. Only 10% of entries are smaller than 10, so that culling small counts would not increase the sparseness of the matrix. Consequently, any computation that employs the fourgram vectors directly would be inefficient. For this reason, a singular value decomposition was performed and 97 singular values extracted (cf. [5]) using an algorithm from SVDPACK [3]. Each fourgram can then be represented by a vector of 97 real values. Since the singular value decomposition finds the best leastsquare approximation of the original space in 97 dimensions, two fourgram vectors will be similar if their original vectors in the collocation matrix are similar. The reduced fourgram vectors can be efficiently used in the following computations.","Cooccurrence information was used for a second time to compute word representations from the fourgram vectors: in this case coocurrence of a target word with any of the 5000 fourgrams. 50,000 words that occurred at least 20 times in 50,000,000 words of the New York Times newswire were selected. For each of the words, a context vector was computed for every position at which it occurred in the text.

We tested the performance of our assignment algorithm by searching for proper names that had high scores for the categories in Table 2. For each category on the left-hand side we show all of the proper names that assigned high scores those categories.

For instance, there are \"diluted\" categories such as \"speech_act\" and \"trait character feature\" whose members are mostly words that are poorly characterized collocationally.

To determine that close association is mutual between two categories, we check for mutual high ranking. Thus category i and j are grouped together if and only if i ranks j highly and j ranks i highly (where \"highly\" was determined by a cutoff value - i and j had to be ranked k or above with respect to each other, for a threshold k). Secondary ranking is needed because some categories are especially \"popular,\" attracting many other categories to them; the secondary rank enables the popular categories to retain only those categories that they mutually rank highly.","The results of this algorithm were difficult to interpret until we displayed them graphically. The graph layout problem is notoriously difficult, but [2] describes a presentation tool based on theoretical work by [6] which uses a force-directed placement model to layout complex networks (edges are modeled as springs; nodes linked by edges are attracted to each other, but all other pairs of nodes are repelled from one another). Figure 2 shows a piece of the network. In these networks only connectivity has meaning; distance between nodes does not connote semantic distance.","Looking at Figure 2 in more detail, we see that categories associated with the notion \"sports\", such as \"athletic_game\", \"race\", \"sports_equipment', and \"sports_implement\", have been grouped together. The network also shows that categories that are specified to be near one another in WordNet, such as the categories related to \"bread\", are found to be closely interrelated. This is useful in case we would like to begin with smaller categories, in order to eliminate some of the large, broad categories that we are currently working with.","The connectivity of the network is interesting also because it indicates the interconnectivity between categories. Athletics is linked to vehicle and competition categories; these in turn link to military vehicles and weaponry categories, which then lead in to legal categories.","Most of the connectivity information suggested by the network was used to create the new categories. However, many of the desireable relationships do not appear in the network, perhaps because of the requirement for highly mutual co-ranking. If we were to relax this assumption we may find better coverage, but perhaps at the cost of more misleading links. The remaining associations where determined by hand, so that the original 726 categories were combined into 106 new super-categories. 5.2 Improving the Topic Labeler The super-categories are intended to group together related categories in order to eliminate topical redundancy in the labeler and to help eliminate inappropriate labels (since the categories are larger and so have more lexical items serving as evidence). Thus the top four or five super-categories should suffice to indicate the main topics of documents. We have not yet rigorously analyzed the performance of the labeler with the original categories or with the super-categories. In future we plan to obtain reader judgements about which categories are the best labels for various texts. Here we show some example output and discuss its characteristics.","The table below compares the results of the labeler using the original categories against the super-categories. The numbers beside the category names are the scores assigned by 65 the algorithm; the scores in both cases are roughly similar. It is important to realize that only the top four or five labels are to be used from the super-categories; since each super-category subsumes many categories, only a few super-categories should be expected to contain the most relevant information.

It describes how Soviet women have little political power, discusses their role as working women, and describes the benefits of college life. The second article is a 77-sentence popular science magazine article about the Magellan space probe exploring Venus. When using the super-categories, the labeler avoids grossly inappropriate labels such as \"mollusk.genus\" and \"goddess\" in the Magellan article, and combines categories such as \"layer\", \"natural_depression\", and \"rock stone\" into the one super-category \"land terra_firma\".

We've used lexical cooecurrence statistics in combination with a modified lexicon to classify proper names, associate more specific senses to broadly defined terms, and classify new words into existing categories with some degree of success. We've also used these statistics to suggest how to rearrange a lexicon with a taxonymic structure into more frame-like categories, and assigned more general main-topic labels to texts based on these categories.","One conclusion that may be drawn from this work, especially the results in Section 4, is that we have provided a mechanism for successfully combining hand-built lexicon information with knowledge-free, statistically-derived information. The combined information from the categories derived from WordNet provided the clusters from which WordSpace centroids could be created, and these centroids in turn provided candidate words to improve the categories.","In future, in addition to expanding the evaluation of the results described here, we would like to try reversing the experiment; that is, starting with WordSpace vectors, see which parts of WordNet should be interlinked into schematic categories.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Jan Pedersen for his help and encouragement.
