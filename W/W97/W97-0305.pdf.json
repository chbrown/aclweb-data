Hearst has already tackled this problem with good results (Hearst, 1994). One of her main assumptions is that a change in subject is accompanied by a change in vocabulary. Using this assumption, but by introducing a new measure of word significance, we have been able to build a robust and reliable algorithm which exhibits improved accuracy without sacrificing language independency. 1 Introduction Automatic detection of subject divisions within a text is considered to be a very difficult task even for humans, let alone machines. But such subject divisions are used in more complex tasks in text processing such as text summarisation. An automatic method for marking subject boundaries is highly desirable. Hearst (Hearst, 1994) addresses this problem by applying a statistical method for detecting subjects within text.","Hearst describes an algorithm for what she calls"]},{"title":"Text Tiling,","paragraphs":["which is a method for detecting subject boundaries within a text. The underlying assumption of this algorithm is that there is a high probability that words which are related to a certain subject will be repeated whenever that subject is mentioned. Another basic assumption is that when a new subject emerges the choice of vocabulary will change, and will stay consistent within the subject boundaries until the next change in subject. These basic notions of vocabulary consistency within subject boundaries lead to a method for dividing text based on calculating vocabulary similarity between two adjacent windows of text.","Each potential subject boundary is identified and assigned a correspondence value based on the lexical similarity between two windows of text, one on either side of the subject boundary. The values for all potential boundaries are plotted on a graph, creating peaks and troughs. The troughs represent changes in vocabulary use and therefore, according to the underlying assumption, a change in subject. A division mark is inserted where a significant local minimum is detected on the graph. Hearst measured approximately 80% success in detection of subject boundaries on some texts.","We decided to adopt Hearst's underlying assumption that a change in subject will entail a change in vocabulary. Our aim was to make the algorithm as language independent and computationally expedient as possible , while also improving accuracy and reliability."]},{"title":"47 I Preprocessing } STAGE I Â¥ ICalculatc a significance 1 STAGE 2 value for each word J V ICalculate biased lexical] STAGE 3 correspondenfes J -v- I Smooth results 1 STAGE 4 Â¥ I Insert breaks ] STAGE 5","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Algorithm Structure. 2 Design The algorithm is divided into five distinct stages. Figure 1 shows the sequential, modular structure of the algorithm. Each stage of the algorithm is described in more detail below. 2.1 Preprocessing (stage 1) In her implementation of the TextTiling algorithm Hearst ignores preprocessing, claiming it does not affect the results (Hearst, 1994). By preprocessing we mean lemmatizing, stemming, converting upper to lower case etc. Testing this assumption on her algorithm indeed seems not to change the results. How-ever, using preprocessing in conjunction with stage 2 of our algorithm, does improve results. It is important for our algorithm that morphological differences between semantically related words are resolved, so that words like \"bankrupt\" and \"bankruptcy\", for example, are identified as the same word. 2.2 Calculating a significance value for","each word (stage 2) Hearst treats a text more or less as a bag of words in its statistical analysis. But natural language is no doubt more structured than this. Different words have differing semantic functions and relationships with respect to the topic of discourse. We can broadly distinguish two extreme categories of words; content words versus function words. Content words introduce concepts, and are the means for the expression of ideas and facts, for example nouns, proper nouns, adjectives and so on. Function words (for example determiners, auxiliary verbs etc.) support and coordinate the combination of content words into meaningful sentences. Obviously, both are needed to form meaningful sentences, but, intuitively, it is the content words that carry most weight in defining the actual topic of discourse. Based on this intuition, we believe it would be advantageous to identify these content words in a text. It would then be possible to bias the calculation of lexical correspondences (stage 3) taking into account the higher significance of these words relative to function words.","We would ideally like firstly to reduce the effect of noisy non-content words on the algorithm's performance, and secondly to pay more attention to words with a high semantic content. In her implementation, Hearst attempts to do this by having a finite list of problematic words that are filtered out from the text before the statistical analysis takes place (Hearst, 1994). These problematic words are primarily function words and low semantic content words, such as determiners, conjunctions, prepositions and very common nouns.","Church and Gale (Church and Gale, 1995) mention the correlation between a word's semantic content and various measures of its distribution throughout corpora. They show that: \"Word rates vary from genre to genre, topic to topic, author to author, document to document, section to sec: tion, paragraph to paragraph. These factors tend to decrease the entropy and increase the other test variables\". One of these other test variables mentioned by Church and Gale is burstiness. They at-tribute the innovation of the notion of burstiness to Slava Katz, who, pertaining to this topic, writes (Katz, 1996): \"The notion of burstiness.., will be used for the characterisation of two closely related but distinct phenomena: (a) document-level burstiness, i.e. multiple occurrence of a content word or phrase in a single text document, which is contrasted with the fact that most other documents contain no other instances of this word or phrase at all; and (b) within-document burstiness (or burstiness proper), i.e. close proximity of all or some individual instances of a content word or phrase within a document exhibiting multiple occurrence.\" Katz has highlighted many interesting features of the distribution of content words, which do not conform to the predictions of statistical models such as the Poisson. Katz (Katz, 1996) states that, when a concept named by a content word is topical for the document, then that content word tends to be characterised by multiple and bursty occurrence. He claims that, while a single occurrence of a topically used content 48 word or phrase is possible, it is more likely that a newly introduced topical entity, will be repeated,"]},{"title":"\"if not for breaking the monotonous effect of pronoun use, then for emphasis or clarity\".","paragraphs":["He also claims","o that, unlike function words, the number of instances E of a specific content word is not directly associated with the document length, but is rather a function ~ of how much the document is about the concept ex- i","~5 pressed by that word.","z","Therefore, the characteristic distribution pattern of topical content words, which contrasts markedly with that of non-topical and non-content words, could provide a useful aid in identifying the semantically relevant words within a text. Brief mention should be made of the work done by Justeson and Katz (Justeson and Katz, 1995), which, to a certain degree, relates to the requirements of our task. In their paper, Justeson and Katz describe some linguistic properties of technical terminology, and use them to formulate an algorithm to identify the technical terms in a given document. However, their algorithm deals with complex noun phrases only, and, although the technical terms identified by their algorithm are generally highly topical, the algorithm does not provide the context sensitive information of how topical each incidence of a given meaningful phrase is, relative to its direct environment. It is precisely this information that is needed to judge the content of a particular segment of text.","Although Katz (Katz, 1996) acknowledges what he calls two distinct, but closely related, forms of burstiness, he concentrates on modelling the inter-document distributions of content words and phrases. He then uses the inter-document distributions to make inferences about probabilities of the repeat occurrences of content words and phrases within a single document. Another divergence between what Katz has done so far and what the task of subject boundary insertion requires, is that he decides to ignore the issues of coincidental repetitions of non-topically used content words and simply equates"]},{"title":"\"single occurrence with non-topical occurrence, and multiple occurrence with topical occurrence.\"","paragraphs":["10 0 6 4 2 i","i","t","i","t","i","t","t","i","0 O.Oi 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1","Propol'fi~i Freiltlerlcy of Word Figure 2: Calculation of number of nearest neighbours. n"]},{"title":"significance(x) = -1 Ã— Z arctan ( Dx,i","paragraphs":["n i=l tWicd]"]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["where x is an individual word in the document and Dx,i is the distance between word x and its ith nearest neighbour.

But for the most frequently occurring words, the number of nearest neighbours is ten. Figure 3 shows the main features of the performance of this significance assignment algorithm when tested on a sample text. The results for three very different words are shown.","Two general trends are the most important features of this graph. Firstly, elevated significance scores are associated with local clusters of a word. For example the cluster of three occurrences of \"software\" (a content word) at the end of the document have high significance scores. This contrasts with the relatively isolated occurrences of the word \"software\" in the middle of the document, which are deemed to be little more significant than several occurrences of the word \"the\" (a function word). Secondly, frequent words tend to receive lower significance scores. For example, even local clusters of the word \"the\" only receive relatively low significance scores, simply because the word has a high frequency throughout the document. Conversely, \"McNealy\" (a high semantic content word), which only occurs in a cluster of three, receives a high significance value. The important result shown by the graph is that content words (real names such as \"McNealy\") receive higher significance values than function words (\"the\").","We found that an"]},{"title":"optimal","paragraphs":["solution to the problem of balancing local density against global frequency was rather elusive. For example, the words at the centre of a cluster automatically receive a higher score, whereas it may be more desirable to have all the members of a cluster assigned a score lying in a narrower range. There are many other contentious issues which need to be investigated, such as the use of the ratio of all the occurrences of a word in a given text to the total length of that text in order to calculate the relative significance measure. Based on intuition, partly derived from Katz's discussion (Katz, 1996) of the relationship between document length and word frequency, the exact nature of this relationship across various document lengths may not be reliable enough. It may be more consistent to consider this ratio within a constant window size, e.g. 1000 words.","The advantage of this simple statistical method of distinguishing significant content words from non-content words is that no words need to be removed before allowing the algorithm to proceed. The output of this stage is a normalised significance score (0-1) for each word in the text. This significance score can then be taken into account when analysing the text for subject boundaries.","2.3 Calculate Biased Lexical Correspondences (stage 3) Let us consider two sets of words, set A and set B.

IAI can be re-written as 1+1+1+1+1 .... by adding a 1 for every word in A.

The same can be done for A ', B and B ~. The formula now takes the average of the biased ratios.

Therefore, the formula actually used is:"]},{"title":"Correspondence= L~I ~-~ \"k I-~P-~I 2","paragraphs":["where A\" is the subset of A which contains only those words that occur in A and not in B. Similarly, B ~ is the subset of B which contains only those words that occur in B and not in A. This is shown in Figure 4.","Recall that [A[, [m'[, [A\"[, [B], [B'] and IS\"[ are not calculated by adding one for each word in each set, but by summing the significance values of the words in each set.","This stage of the processing looks at the output from the significance calculation stage and considers every sentence break in turn - starting at the top of the document and working down. The algorithm assigns a correspondence measure to each sentence break as follows: Firstly, set A is generated by taking all the words in the previous fifteen sentences. Next, set B is generated by taking all the words in the following fifteen sentences. 1 Now sets A p, A ~, B ~ and B ~ are generated as described and then the formula above is applied which assigns a correspondence value to the sentence break currently under consideration. The algorithm then moves to the next sentence break and repeats the process.","The output from this stage of the algorithm is a list of sentence break numbers (1..n, with n = number of sentences in the document) and a lexical correspondence measure. These numbers provide the input for stage four - smoothing.","1Fifteen sentences turns out to be the optimum window size for the vast majority of texts. This is because it is about the same as the average segment size. 2.4 Smoothing (stage 4) A graph can be plotted with lexical correspondence along the y-axis and sentence number along the x-axis. In order to distinguish the significant peaks and troughs from the many minor fluctuations, a simple smoothing algorithm is used.

This is performed simultaneously on every point on the graph. The process is k then iterated a fixed number of times. The result is that noise is flattened out while the larger peaks and troughs remain (although slightly smaller).","The output from this stage is simply the sentence break numbers and their new, smoothed correspondence values. 2.5 Inserting subject boundaries (stage 5) Considering the graph described in the previous section, generating subject boundaries is simply a matter of identifying local minima on the graph. The confidence of a boundary is calculated from the 'depth' of the local minimum. This depth is calculated simply by taking the average of the heights of the 'peak' (relative to the height of the minimum) on either side of the minimum. This now yields a list of candidate subject boundaries and an associated confidence measure for each one. Breaks are then inserted into the original text at the places correspond-ing to the local minima if their confidence value satisfies a 'minimum confidence' criterion. This cut-off criterion is arbitrary, and in our implementation can be specified at run time. 3 Results","Figure 6 shows the result of processing the first 800 sentences from an edition of The Times newspaper.

The local minima on the graph signify the boundaries as determined by the algorithm. The vertical bars signify the actual article boundaries.

It is worth noting that the minima occurring within this article are not as pronounced as the actual article boundaries themselves. This section of the graph reflects a long article which contains a number of different subtopics.","A newspaper is an easy test for such an algorithm though. Figure 7 shows a graph for an expository text - a 200 sentence psychology paper written by a fellow student. Again the local minima indicate where the algorithm considers a subject boundary to occur and the vertical lines are the obvious breaks in the text (mainly before new headings) as judged by the author.

This level of accuracy was obtained consistently for a variety of different texts. Again, it should be mentioned that the algorithm found more breaks than were immediately obvious to a human judge. However, it should be noted that these extra breaks were usually denoted by smaller minima, and on inspection the vast majority of them were in sensible places.","The algorithm has a certain resolving power. As the subject matter becomes more and more homogeneous, the number of subject breaks the algorithm finds decreases. For some texts, this results in very few divisions being made. By taking a smaller window size (the number of sentences to look at either side of each possible sentence break), the resolving power 'of the algorithm can be increased making it more sensitive to changes in the vocabulary. How-ever, the reliability of the algorithm decreases with the increased resolving power. The default window size is fifteen sentences and this works well for all but the most homogeneous of texts. In this case a window size of around six is more effective. A lower window size increases the resolving power, but decreases the accuracy of the algorithm.

The addition of the significance measure represents an improvement on Hearst's algorithm implemented by the Berkeley Digital Library Project.","Furthermore, this algorithm is language independent except for the preprocessing stage (which can be omitted with only a modest degradation in performance). In order to improve accuracy, language dependent methods could be considered. Such methods might include the insertion of conventional discourse markers in order to detect preferred breaking points (e.g. repetition of the same syntactic structure, and conventional paragraph openings such as: \"On the other hand...\", \"The above...\", etc.). Another method would be to make use of a thesaurus, since we have found that human judgement is often based on synonymous information such as real synonyms or anaphora. The above issues are discussed in various articles (Morris and Hirst, 1991); (Morris, 1988) and (Givon, 1983) which study discourse markers and synonymous information.","Another interesting line of research would be to use the information from stage two of the algorithm to discover the significant words of a section, and thereby attach a label to it.
