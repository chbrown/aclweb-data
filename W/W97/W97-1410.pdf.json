For both tasks, an explicit representation of the content of the multimodal expressions is required. An important aspect of the media coordination is to ensure the cohesion of the resulting multimodal presentation.","One way to tie the expressions in the different modes together is to generate referring expressions using co-referential relations between text and graphics. In order to construct appropriate referring expressions for the displayed objects in the graphics, one has to choose what attributes of the objects could be used for constructing an unambiguous linguistic realization. Most of the algorithms proposed by other researchers (e.g. (Dale and Reiter, 1995)) use information on the type of the object and perceptually recoguisable attributes like colour or shape. Some systems exploit additional information as descriptors such as the information on complex objects and their components (IDAS (Reiter et al., 1995)) or the spatial inclusion relation (KAMP (Appelt, 1985)). How-ever, other kinds of descriptors, such as information on the relative location of a component with respect to another, have not been used yet.","In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute a set of components for sides of complex ob-","*Otto-yon- Guericke-Universit~it Magdeburg, Institut fiir Informations- und Kommunikationssysteme, P.O.Box 41 20, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany Email: hartmann~iik.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","t software design & management GmbH & Co.

Based on this information, referring expressions can be generated that exploit information on relative location of the components of a complex object.","This paper is organised as follows: In section 2, we describe how the content of a computer generated graphics is represented and propose an algorithm to compute a set of so-called characteristic component. The result of our algorithm can be applied to the generation of referring expressions, as described in section 3. In section 4, we discuss our results by comparing our algorithm with other reference algorithms. Section 5 gives a short summary and describes future work.","2 Describing the content of pictures In this section we describe how we represent the content of graphics by an enumeration of the depicted objects and propose an algorithm to compute the characteristic components for a side of a complex object.

Nevertheless, as user modelling is not the focus of this work, we do not investigate this topic.","The algorithm in figure 3 computes the characteristic components for a given side s using the criterion above.

In the following, we show how we compute navigational and discriminating descriptions of a given intended referent, especially a component of a complex object, using the results of our characteristic component algorithm.","As shown in example 4, the characteristic component algorithm computes sets of characteristic components for the intrinsic sides of a given complex object. Assuming that the system wants to refer to a component of the complex object, the intended referent can be an element of a unary set, of a non-unary set or it can be no element of a set of characteristic components at all. We will analyse all these cases in turn. Where the intended referent belongs to several characteristic component sets, the system selects one, preferring the smallest set, in order to generate referring expressions which employ a minimal number of descriptors.","Case 1: The intended referent is a unique characteristic component. Figure 1 shows the front side, the top side and the right side of a toaster. The elevating pushbutton and the roast intensity selector are both elements of a unary set of characteristic components for the front side. Hence, one can refer unambiguously to these components in an associated text, because the addressee can unambiguously distinguish these components from all components which are located on the other sides of the depicted toaster and hence no navigational description is necessary."]},{"title":"Press the spray button.","paragraphs":["Figure 5: An example for a missing co-referential coordination between text and graphics (AndrE, 1995, page 80)","However, the characteristic component algorithm considers only the components which are located on other sides, but not the components which are located on the same side. For the generation of referring expressions, the intended referent has also to be distinguished from the other components on the same side of the complex object. Figure 5, for instance, shows a detail of an iron with two buttons on the top side. According to the characteristic component algorithm both buttons represent unique characteristic components for the top side of the depicted electric iron, and hence no navigational description is generated.","Nevertheless, we still have to provide discriminating descriptions for the intended referent with respect to the set of the components of the same type on that side.

Since the set of characteristic components enables the hearer to infer on which side these components are located, no further navigational information is needed, if all components of that set are mentioned in the referring expression. For the construction of the referring expression, we compute a set of discriminating descriptions for the intended referent with respect to the other components in the set of characteristic components C' (formally C' is the set difference of the set of characteristic components C and the intended referent {r}). These discriminating descriptions of the intended referent should be perceptually recognisable, like its colour, shape or the relative location with respect to the other components in C' and can be retrieved from the illumination model or the geometric model.","If we use the relative location of the intended referent with respect to all the components in C' for generating the referring expression, no further navigational information needs to be included, as the intended referent together with C' specifies a"]},{"title":"Exploiting Image Descriptions for the Generation of Referring Expressions 77","paragraphs":["set of characteristic components and all the components of this characteristic component set are mentioned in the referring expression.","In example 4, the component a6 on side s8 is in-cluded in the set {a6, b6, ~ } of characteristic components. To enable the addressee to distinguish the intended referent a6 from b6 and c6, we have to provide further descriptors. Thus, we have to search for perceptually recognisable attributes of a6 like its colour, shape -- or its relative location with respect to b6 and c6.","Case 3: The intended referent is not an element of a characteristic component set at all. Navigational information indicating on which side the intended referent is located has to be included. In addition, we have to provide discriminating descriptions for the intended referent that distinguish it from all the other components which are located on this side. This set of discriminating descriptions can be computed by a traditional reference algorithm. If the system intends to refer to the component al of side sl in example 4, it would insert the name of the side sl as navigational information and the set of attributes which distinguishes al from bl. 4 Discussion In previous work to generate referring expressions several algorithms were proposed (Dale and Reiter, 1995), (Horacek, 1996). The main goal of these algorithms is to compute a referring expression for a given referent, which enables the hearer to distinguish it from all other objects in the hearer's focus of attention, the"]},{"title":"contrast set.","paragraphs":["Dale and Reiter proposed a number of algorithms that differ in their computational complexity. Since the task of finding the minimal set of descriptors is NP-hard 3, a number of heuristics are used, which approximate the minimal set.","The computation of the referring expressions in our approach is done in a two-stage process: First, we use only the type information to find the characteristic components of the sides which can be used for the generation of navigational descriptors. In a second step, classical reference algorithms compute the discriminating information for the intended referent with a reduced contrast set using perceptually recoguisable attributes like colour, shape and relative location of components with respect to other components.","The proposed characteristic component algorithm computes a set of descriptors which enable","3The problem can be transformed into the problem to find the minimal size set cover, which is proven to be NP-haxd (Garey and Johnson, 1979). the addressee to identify a side of a given complex object in contrast to the set of the other sides of the given object. For the characteristic component algorithm, while the intended referent is the given side of the object, the other sides of the object can be considered as the contrast set in Dale & Reiter's terms. In contrast to (Dale and Reiter, 1995) where at most one descriptor set is computed which distinguishes the referent from all other objects in the contrast set, our algorithm computes all minimal descriptor sets. The algorithm is far more expensive than classical reference algorithms, because we calculate all minimal distinguishing descriptions of the given side using only the type attribute. On the other hand, this enables us to use sources other than the partwhole relation (IDAS (Reiter et al., 1995)) or the spatial inclusion relation (KAMP (Appelt, 1985)) for the generation of the navigational part of the referring expression.","The set of characteristic components contains no negative expressions. Negative expressions would enable us to compute characteristic components of sides, for which the proposed algorithm computes an empty set of characteristic components. On the other hand, that would force us to generate referring expressions which contain statements about components that are not located on the same side as the intended component. We think that statements of this kind would confuse the addressee.","This proposed work incorporates propositional and analogue representation as suggested by (Habel et al., 1995). Within the VisDok-project (visualization in technical documentation), we decided to combine geometric information and information gained from the illumination model with a propositional representation of the type of the objects in a knowledge base.","A first prototypical system for the generation of multimodal multilingual documentation for technical devices within an interactive setting has been realised. We employ separate processes for the rendering of predefined pictures and animations, and text generation. Our algorithm enables us to minimise the time-consuming communication between separate processes in order to generate referring expressions, as the procedure described in section 3 relies only partly on perceptually recognisable attributes of objects like colour, shape and relative location while employing the type attribute, which is explicitly represented in the knowledge base."]},{"title":"78 K.

This information is computed as a side effect of the rendering algorithm and can be used in our framework. Especially for complex objects, the is-located-on relation can be computed automatically and serves as the input data for our algorithm. 6 Acknowledgement The authors want to thank Brigitte Grote, lan Pitt, BjSrn HSfiing and Oliver Brandt for discussing the ideas presented in this paper and a careful reading.
