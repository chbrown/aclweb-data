This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural language processing systems. For example, in a machine translation system, the system needs to recognize those elements which are not present in the source language, but may become mandatory elements in the target language. In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese; whereas they are normally obligatory in English. Thus, in Japanese-to-Engiish ma~ne translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (\"zero pronouns\") for their translation into Engiish expressions.","Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1990; Â¥oshimoto, 1988; Dousa~a, 1994). V/hen considering the application of these methods to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area can not be 1/mired, it is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resohtion is low as they only use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand is so large. 127","To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider appl/cations for a practical machine translation system with an n~]imJted translation target area, have been proposed (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakalwa and Ikehara, 1996). These methods use categorized semantic and pragznatic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns.","But, with these methods it is necessary to make resolution rules for zero pronouns by hand. To make robust rules, with wide coverage, takes a lot of time and labor. Analysts who make these resolution rules must be f~rnl]iar with the NLP system itself. Furthermore, the types of zero pronouns change depending on the types of documents which must be analyzed. So, resolution rules must be made depencling on the target domain of the documents. But, it is very difficult to make rules for every domain because of the time cons-rni~g labor and the need for expertise. Because of these problems, a method to make resolution rules of zero pronouns effectively and efficiently is aeeded.","In order to acquire resolution rules for a NLP system effectively and efficiently, various methods have been proposed. One typical method for this purpose is to use a corpus for extracting resolution rules by analyzing each sentence hi the corpus. With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasukawa, 1996). But t]zese methods use monolingual corpora and they find it difficult to extract resolution rules of zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese. Furthermore, rules can only be made when slrnilar expressions to those containing the zero pronouns are found in the corpus.","It seems that a bilingual corpus consisting of sentence pairs, with an original in one language and a translation, is better than a monolingual corpus for the purpose of acquiring resolution rules of zero pronouns. This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of Japanese and Engl/sh whose language farn~lles are so different and in which the distribution of zero pronouns is also very different. This combination is more useful than the bilingual corpora of similar languages.","The technique for acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora needs to include several kinds of sub-techniques; identification of aligned sentence pairs which consist of pairs of one language sentence and translation equivalents of the sentence (sentence alignment); identification of equivalent words/phrases pairs from aligned sentence pairs (word alignment); and extraction of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from identified aligned sentence pairs and equivalent word/phrase pairs.","Several methods have been proposed with regard to aligning sentences (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996; Kay and l~osche/sen, 1993), alJs~nlng words (Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Wu, 1995; Yamada et al., 1996) and acquiring rules from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tana~, 1994; Yamada et al., 1995). From the point of view of the extraction of resolution rules of zero pronouns, a technique to identify zero pronouns in a sentence in one language and their antecedents in a translation from aligned sentence pairs is needed. But there is currently no method to identify zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically within bilingual corpora. 128"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["1.2 A Method for Extraction of Resolution Rules for Japanese Zero Pronouns This section describes the overall design of a method for automatically extracting resolution rules for Japanese zero pronouns from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs. 1 Figure 1 shows an overview of the system. As shown in this figure, the aligned sentence pairs, consisting of a Japanese sentence and its English translation, are analyzed individually by Japanese and English syntactic and semantic parsers. Next, the system identifies the pairs of Japanese word/phrase and their English equivalent word/phrase, by comparing these two structures, based on the Japanese structure and the English structure which are created by the Japanese and English parsers. Then, Japanese zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and translation equivalents of their antecedents in the English sentence are identified. By using these results, based on the Japanese structure, the resolution rules for Japanese zero pronouns within Japanese sentences are created. In the next step, the resolution rules are used for the semantic and pragmatic analysis of the Japanese sentence by the Japanese parser within the whole rule extlra~tion system. The same Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs are inputted to the system and resolution rules of Japanese zero pronouns are again extracted. These processes are repeated until the system c~.~ot extract any more rules for Japanese zero pronouns resolution from the aligned sentence pairs.","In this paper, I describe the core method to identify zero pronouns within a Japanese sentence and translation equivalents of their antecedents within a corresponding English sentence, shown by the shaded area in Figure 1."]},{"title":"I 2 Appearance of Zero Pronouns and Their Antecedents within Japanese and English Aligned Sentence Pairs","paragraphs":["In order to understand the distribution of zero pronouns with antecedents within Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs, this section examines which zero pronouns in Japanese must be explicitly translated into English and where their antecedents appear in EngJJsh, using a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems (Ikehara et al., 1994). The test set (3718 sentences) has many examples of zero pronouns with intrasentential and deictic references. 2 The sentence set was created to test the coverage of expressions that can be translated by Japanese-to-English MT systems based on the varieties of Japanese expressions and the differences between Japanese and English. The sentence set has approximately 500 kinds of test items. Each sentence has a manual translation, and almost all of the sentences can be translated without contextual information (3704 sentences out of 3718 sentences). A MT system can be evaluated by comparing its output to the equivalent manual translation. Each sentence is expressed in natural Japanese and the sentence set covers many different expressions.

There were a total of 554 zero pronouns in 437 sentences. The location of the referential elements can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressed in the same Japanese sentence, and those not expressed in the same Japanese sentence. The latter were further classified into 7 kinds. Â• The zero pronoun is not translated because the passive voice is used. Â• The referent is the wr/ter or speaker, uI'; or a group, \"we\". Â• The referent is the reader or hearer, ~you'. Â• The referent is human but it is not known who the human is. Â• The zero pronoun should be translated as \"it \". Â• The zero pronoun should be translated as \"this\". Â• The referent is another specific element.","According to this study of the functional test sentence set, in 150 out of 554 instances (27%) the antecedents were expressed within the Japanese sentence and in 404 out of 554 instances (73%) the referent was not expressed in the Japanese sentence. Zero pronouns could be left unexpressed by converting the translation to the passive voice in 157 instances (28~). The other zero pronouns, 247 instances (45~), referred to referents that did not appear in the Japanese sentence but did appear in the English translation. This result shows that aligned sentence pairs win be effective for identifying zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically by determining zero pronouns in Japanese and their antecedents in English.","According to a further examination of the English equivalents of Japanese zero pronouns in the sentence set in Table 1, depending on the types of referential elements, the style of the English equivalents are different.

The shaded part of Figure 1 shows an overview of the system. The system consists of the following three parts; the analysis of the Japanese sentence; the analysis of the Engtish sentence; and the identification of Japanese zero pronouns in Japanese sentences and their antecedents in English equivalent sentences. The next three subsections describe the details of these three process. 3.1 Analysis of Japanese Sentences The Japanese sentences are analyzed using the morphological, syntactic and semantic analyzers of Japanese in ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991). The analysis of the Japanese sentences consists of the following steps.","1) Morphological analysis of Japanese sentences In this step, Japanese sentence is segmented into words and each word is tagged with its part of speech.","2) Syntactic and semantic analysis of Japanese sentences In this step, using each word within the Japanese sentence and the tagged information for each word, the syntactic and semantic structure of the Japanese sentence is created. Because the Japanese syntactic and semantic structure is used for the automatic translation to English in ALT-J/E, the Japanese structure contains information about the syntactic position of Japanese zero pronouns which must be translated into English and also contains the semantic constraints for the Japanese zero pronouns forced by the meaning of the verb within the Japanese sentence. For the semantic constraints, we used our original semantic attribute system(Ogura et al., 1993). The semantic attribute system has a semantic concept hierarchy which represents \"is-a\" relationships and ~has-a\" relationships, with some 2,800 attributes (12-level tree structure) for common nouns, and some 200 attributes (9-level tree structure) for proper nouns.

The predicate part means the consecutive words which consist of verb and modal, tense and aspect. Each predicate part is distinguished by its voice. Next, the subject of the predicate part and the direct object of the predicate part are determined from noun phrases within the English sentence.

But, normally, English parsers make many possible syntactic structures which are often incorzect. So, when an English parser is used for the English syntactic analysis for this step, the system must select the best structure from the candidates. Furthermore, as shown in the following step, the partial syntactic structures are all that is needed for the identh~cation of antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns within the Eng~sh translation. So, to keep the robustness, I only use Brill's Eng~sh ta~er and partial syntactic parser. 133 ellipsis exists or is ellipsed and their omitted element has already been determined, the subject noun phrase is determined as the omitted dement for the ellipsis.","4) Anaphora resolution of anaphoric expressions within the English sentence The anaphora resolution of anaphoric expression such as pronouns and definite noun phrases, is conducted using the partial syntactic structure of the English sentence. According to this step, even if the antecedents of zero pronouns in Japanese are anaphoric expressions such as pronouns and definite noun phrases, the anaphora resolution process determines the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and the overall system can determine the intersentential and intrssentential resolution rules of Japanese zero pronouns by using identified pairs of the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and their Japanese equivalents. 4","For example from the English sentence in aligned sentence pair (1), the following partial syntactic","Â• structure is created.","(3) Pzrtial syntactic structure of an English Sentence (1)","S : u-sent- I","[- PRED : pred-1","] =want ~ : VERB, NON-3RD PS.

I align the Japanese and English elements as described in Y~.raada et al. (1996) using the following information:","Â• bilingual dictionary for Japanese to English MT system, ALT-J/E This dictionary is used for the determination of pairs of equivalent word phrases of Japanese and English.","Â• English dictionary for English generation in ALT-J/E This dictionary is used when the SUiFLX differs: for example the derivative, 'ing', between the English word in the bilingual dictionary entry and the English word in the English sentence within the aligned sentence pair.","6This step has not been implemented because anaphora resolution of English sentences needs detailed syntactic and semantic structure to achieve high accuracy. So, for now, I do not realize the anaphorz resolution process in the whole system for the primary examination. 134 We remove function words such as prepositions, determiners and others from the target English sentence to find Japanese equivalent words/phrases in Japanese. This is because function words often must be changed depending on the types of head such as verb for preposition and noun for determ/ner in English. As a result of this step, the alignment information of aligned words/phrases pairs are tagged for the Japanese and English structure. Furthermore, semantic information which was tagged in a Japanese word/phrase are also ta~ed for the English word/phrase which is aligned with the Japanese word/phrase.","2) Identification of the candidates for antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns within the English sentence: In this step, the following English words/phrases are identified within the English sentence as possible translation equivalents: • personal pronouns such as \"I\" or \"you\" • Uone\". • demonstratives such as x/t\" or \"that\" • definite noun phrases such as a noun phrase with a definite article (e.g. \"the company\")","3) Alignment of zero pronouns in Japanese sentences and translation equivalents of their referents in English sentences: The pairs of Japanese words/phrases and English equi~alent words/phrases and the pairs of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and their antecedents in the English sentence are determ/ned from: the candidates for the pairs of Japanese word/phrases and their English equivalent word/phrases which were identi~ed at step 1; and the candidates for the antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns within the English sentence which were identified at step 2. This determination is conducted based on how stron~y related the candidates are and how many pairs can be identified from them. The rules for the determination of the pairs of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and their antecedents in the English sentence are summarized as follows. The rules are extracted by hand based on the exarnlnation of the test set in Section 2. s When applying the following rules for each zero pronoun, even if the rule is matched and the poss/ble antecedent of the zero pronoun is determined, if the candidate does not satisfy the semantic constraints for the zero pronoun, the rule is not applied and the candidate is not determined as the antecedent of the zero pronoun. The rules are applied hi the following order. If one rule is satisfied for each zero pronoun, the process of the following other rules application stops, except for rule 9.

The conditions for the evaluation were as follows: 4.1.1 Evaluation of Target Sentence Pairs The evaluation used Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs which contain zero pronouns (554 instances; 437 sentences) in a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems (Ikehara et al., 1994) (3718 sentence pairs). 4.1.2 Analysis of Japanese and English sentence For the sentence pairs which contain zero pronouns, the syntactic and semantic structure of each Japanese sentence was created using the Japanese-to-English MT system, ALT-J/E as the Japanese analyzer, described in section 3.1, and the partial syntactic structure of each English sentence was created using Brill's tagger as the English analyzer, described in section 3.2.

As shown in this table, the accuracy of identified antecedents for three types of zero pronouns using rules described in Section 3.3 is as high as 91.5% in the test using an English analyzer with anaphora resolution and 87.2% even in the test using an English analyzer without anaphora resolution. In particular, the identification of unatignable for zero pronouns with deictic referents which are not expressed in English translation is 100~ accurate in both tests. Furthermore, according to these results, the anaphora resolution in English only affects the accuracy of antecedent identification for the zero pronouns with intrasentential antecedents (89.3% with anaphora resolution, 73.3% without anaphora resolution).

This problem is also caused by the limitations of proposed method. The remaining case is caused by the fact that the verb of the zero pronoun and the verb of their antecedents could not be aligned. This is not a ]imitation of proposed method but a ]imitation of the alignment algorithm. These results shows that, for the test set, 508 out of 554 zero pronouns can have their antecedents identified using proposed method methodologically, and ~]most all of the antecedents of zero pronouns which can be identified from the Japanese and English alig)aed sentence pairs are correctly identified by using proposed method (99.8% ; 507 out of 508 instances).","Table 3: The Cause of the Error in Automatic Identification of antecedents","the cause of the ~or \"\" U Intrasenten~al Deictic(explic/t) Total free translation 11 31 42","pass/ve voice 4 0 4","pre.dicate can not be aligned 1 \" 0 i","According to these results, the proposed method is effective for the automatic identification of Japanese zero pronouns and their antecedents from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs and by using a large amount of aligned sentence pairs it is possible to identify antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns for almost all types of Japanese zero pronouns."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a powerful method for the automatic identification of Japanese zero pronouns and their antecedents from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs. In this paper, only Japanese and EngLish language pairs have been discussed. But this method can be applied to various kinds of language pairs such as Italian and English, and the effectiveness of the identification depends on how different the two languages are. In the future, the effectiveness of proposed method for aligned sentence pairs with zero pronouns with intersentential antecedents and for very large corpora of aligned sentence pairs will be ex~mlned. The effectiveness of the use of English parsers for the English analysis will also be considered. Methods for extracting the most effective rules for resolving Japanese zero pronouns from aligned sentence pairs will also be studied. Furthermore, I would like to link more powerful and more robust word alignment techniques, which can align for unknown words in noisy texts, to the proposed method and also would like to link the proposed method with sentence alignment techniques. 139 Acknowledgments I would like to thank ~fun'ichi Tsnjii for helpful discussion of many of the ideas and proposals presented here during my stay at UMIST from September 1995 to September 1996.
