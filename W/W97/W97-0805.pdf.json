Italian WORDNET has been coupled with a parser and a number of experiments have been performed to individuate the methodology with the best trade-off between disambiguation rate and precision. Results confirm intuitive hypothesis on the role of selectional restrictions and show evidences for a WORDNET-Iike organization of lexical senses. 1 Introduction WORDNET is a thesaurus for the English language based on psycholinguistics principles and developed at the Princeton University by George Miller [Miller, 1990]. It has been conceived as a computational resource, so improving some of the drawbacks of traditional dictionaries, such as the circularity of the definitions and the ambiguity of sense references. Lemmas (about 130,000 for version 1.5) are organized in synonyms classes (about 100,000 synsets).","The more evident problem with WORDNET is that it is a lexical knowledge base for English, and so it is not usable for other languages.

Selectional restrictions provide explicit semantic information that the verb supplies about its arguments [Jackendoff, 1990], and should be fully integrated into the verb's argument structure.","Although selectional restrictions are different in different domains [Basili"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1996] we are interested in finding common invariants across sublanguages. It is our intention to build a very general instrument that can be afterwards tuned to particular domains by identifying more specific uses. The main motivation is to have both a robust and a computational efficient natural language system. On one hand, robustness is emphasized because sentences that are syntactically correct, but which are not successfully analyzed in the specific application do-main, can have a valid linguistic meaning. On the other hand, we are able to filter the sentence meanings on a linguistic basis. This phase discards the unplausible lectures pruning the search space by looking for compatibility semantic relations. This kind of discrimination can be realized with computationally effective algorithms by exploiting the lexical taxonomy of WORDNET, postpon-ing more complex and expensive computations to the domanin specific analysis.","The paper is structured as follow. Section 2 describes the Italian prototype of WORDNET; while section 3 shows how selectional restrictions has been added to verb senses. Section 4 shows how Italian WOttDNET has been coupled with the parser, both for describing lexical senses and as a repository for selectional restrictions. Section 5 reports a number of experiments that has been performed to individuate the methodology design with the best trade-off between disambiguation rate and precision. Finally section 6 provides some conclusive remarks. 2 The Italian WORDNET Prototype The Italian version of WORDNET is based on the as-sumption that a large part of the conceptual relations defined for English (about 72,000 ISA relations and"]},{"title":"5,600","paragraphs":["PART-OF relations) can be shared with Italian. WORDNET can be described as a lexical matrix with two dimensions: the lexical relations, which hold among words and so are language specific, and the conceptual relations, which hold among senses and that, at least in part, we consider independent from a particular lan-32 Wo~s P Meanings HASPAR'r"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["Lonymy ;ynsS) Pohsemy Figure h Multilingual lexical matrix guage. The Italian version of WORDNET aims at the realization of a multilingual lexical matrix through the addition of a third dimension relative to the language. Figure 1 shows the three dimensions of the matrix: (a) words in a language, indicated by YY~ ; (b) meanings, indicated by .A4~; (c) languages, indicated by Â£k. From an abstract point of view, to develop the multilingual matrix it is necessary to re-map the Italian lexical forms with corresponding meanings (.A4,), building the set of synsets for Italian (making explicit the values for the","I intersections Â£~). The result will be a complete redefinition of the lexical relations, while for the semantic relations, those originally defined for English will be used as much as possible.","An implementation of the Multilingual lexical matrix has been realized which allows a complete integration with the English version and the availability of all the translations for the Italian lemmas. The architecture is easily extendable to other languages. The integration with the computational lexicon ILEX is under development: it will make the access to other levels of lexical information, such as morphological classes, syntactic categories and sub-categorization frames available. The Italian version of WORDNET, in December 1996, included about 10,000 lemmas (7,000 nouns, 700 verbs, 1,500 adjectives, 600 adverbs).","Till now, data acquisition has been mostly manual, with the help of a graphical interface; however a basic goal of the project is the experimentation of techniques for the (semi)automatic acquisition of data. Algorithms for the resolution of the ambiguities in the coupling with the English WORDNET have been developed. Versions automatically created are then tested against manually acquired data, with the aim of incrementally improve the precision level. A final manual check is performed for all the data automatically acquired. It is also foreseen the use of corpora to extract contextual information to be used during the disambiguation process.","3 Adding Selectional Restrictions to Verbs A number of steps have been followed to add selectional restrictions to Italian WORDNET. First, Italian verb senses were extracted from a paper version of an Italian dictionary and checked against a corpus of genereric Italian texts. Each verb sense has been then coupled with one or more English WORDNET synsets 2. This phase has been performed manually with the help of a graphical interface (see figure 2) that includes four integrated working tools: (i) a bilingual dictionary with more than 30,000 lemmas; (ii) a graph that allows the visualiza-tion of the coupling with the English WORDNET; (iii) the bilingual WoRDNET, that behaves exactly like the English version with the additional possibility to browse the Italian semantic network; (iv) finally, the working cards allow the insertion, modification and check of the data for a synset. The result of this phase is the extension of the English WordNet with the Italian synsets. Figure 3 shows the correspondence between English and Italian synsets for the verb Scrivere (Write).","The next step is the definition of the sense subgategorization frame. This includes both syntactic information (i.e., argumental positions, prepositions on indirect objects, category type) and semantic information, such as thematic roles and selectional restrictions. Syntactic information are associated to single verbs, while semantic information are associated to the whole synset, i.e., semantic participants are shared among all the verbs be-longing to the synset.","We built selectional restrictions using the synsets of the noun hyerarchy. Two different possibilities for defin-ing selectional restrictions are considered:","1. Selectional restrictions obtained from the frames currently provided by WoRDNET.","~As for figurative uses, they can also be coupled with WoRDNET provided that an appropriate synset do exist. 33"]},{"title":"!","paragraphs":["en$$ Z inÂ¥1are msrld~e $cnveM spedlre ~eeilse 3 8c~vsre pubbl~csr8 Se.se 4 Se\"le 5 Sc~Wm ~dlge~ comporm Figure 2: The Italian WORDNET interface.","2. Selectional restrictions obtained from the whole WORDNET noun hierarchy.","As far as the first hypothesis is concerned, WoRDNET describes all the English verbs resorting to a set of 35 different syntactic frames, which in turn include only two restrictions, that is Something and Somebody. For example, the frames provided for the verb Write in the synset {Publish, Write} are: Somebody... s Somebody... s Something The problem arising in using these two restrictions is that they are completely uncorrelated to the noun synsets, then, they have to be matched with the proper synsets in the noun hierarchy. The concept Somebody includes not only the synset Person but also all the synsets denoting group of people that could hold the agent thematic role. We defined Somebody using the following boolean combination of synsets:","Somebody Person V People V People-Multitude V (Social-Group A ~(Society V Subculture V Political-System V Moiety V Clan)) Something is defined as ~he complement of Somebody.","In the second hypothesis selectional restrictions are taken from the whole noun hierarchy. As an example, figure 4 illustrates the senses for the Italian verb Scrivere (Write) found in Italian WORDNET. For each sense we report a conventional name - which unambiguously identifies the synset - and the argumental positions admitted for that sense, with the indication of the selectional restrictions. The appropriate combination of synsets for an argumental position has to be both enough general to preserve all the human readings, and enough restricted for discriminating among different senses of both verb and noun.","Founding the appropriate selectional restrictions revealed itself difficult and time consuming. The process required a deep search into the WOI~DNET noun hierarchy. In order to achieve a good trade-off between discrimination power and precision level we adopted an empirical process with successive steps of refinement. We started with general selectional restrictions and then we validate them against experimental results. This iteratire process ended with complex selectional restritions for verbs, as the figure 4 shows.","The WORDNET verb taxonomy is based on the ~roponymy relation, which is defined as the co-occurrence of both lexical implication and temporal co-extension between two verbs. We would note that, every time a troponymy relation between two verbs holds, an ISA rela-34 Synset Label Italian Synset English Synset Write Write-Music Writs-Communicate Write-Publish Write-Send {scrivere redigere comporre}","{scrivere comporre}","{scrivere comunlcare_per..iscritto}","{scrivere pubblicare }","{inviare mandare scrivere spedire} {write compose pen indite} {compose write write_music}","{write communicate_by.writing express.by_writing}","{publish write}","{mail write post send} Figure 3: Correspondences between Italian and English synsets for the verb 'scrsrere' (write).","WoRDNET Synset [ Subject Object Indlrect-Object","Write Somebody ---- Written-MateriaiV Symbolic-Repres V SayingV Correspondence V Sentencer Message V Message-ContentV Code V Symbol V Dater Lan~..mge--Unit V PropertyV Address-SpeechV Print-Media","Write-Music Person Music --","Write-Communicate Somebody Somebody (Written-4{aterialA ~Section)V Symbolic-Repres V SayingV Sentence V NameV Message V Message-ContentV Code V Date V Property","Write-Publish Somebody Written-MateriaiV Print..-MediaV Publishing-House (Print-MediaA ~Section)","Write-Send Somebody CorrespondenceV MessageV Somebody Letter-Missive Figure 4: Lexical entries for Scriveze (Writs). tion between the correspondent selectional restrictions holds, too. 4"]},{"title":"Coupling WORDNET and a TFS Parser","paragraphs":["In this section we describe the architecture we used for checking WORDNET usability in parsing. Italian WORDNET has been used in two different phases of the linguistic analysis. On a first phase, we use Italian WORDNET as a lexicon repository to carry on lexical analysis. During the semantic analysis Italian WORDNET is used as a kind of Knowledge Base (KB) exploiting the structural relationships among synsets. In particular, we used the supertype/subtype-like hierarchy of synsets during the parsing process in order to discard unplausible constituents on a semantic base.","The parser used is a CYK chart parser embedded in the GEPPETTO environment [Ciravegna Â¢t"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1996], and coupled with a proper unification algorithm. GEPPETTO is based on a Typed Feature Logic [-Carpenter, 1992] for the specification of linguistic data. The GEPPETTO environment allows to edit and debug grammars and lexica, linking linguistic data to a parser and/or a generator, integrating various form of KBs, and using specialized processors (e.g., morphological analyzers). In particular, we integrated the hierarchical structure of WORDNET as an external KB, while an ISA function uses the WORDNET hierarchy in order to check subsumption relationships between WoRDNET synsets.","The grammar is written adopting a HPSG-like style, and each rule is regarded as Typed Feature Structure (TFS). For the current experiment the grammar coverage is limited to very simple verbal sentences formed by a subject, a main verb together with its internal arguments and, possibly, an adjunct phrase. Observe that, the syntactic analysis does not take into account the ppattachment case. We excluded the possibility to capture these complex nominal phrases. Indeed, the object of the experiment is to disambiguate among WORDNET senses of both verbs and nouns on the basis of the lexical semantic restrictions for the arguments of the verb and the lexical semantic associated to the noun.","A condition for using WORDNET coupled with the GEPPETTO environment is to bring it in a format effectively usable. The exploited idea was to rebuild the WORDNET hierarchy in CLOS, the object-oriented part of COMMON LISP. The advantages of this approach is 35 Word Regina (Queen) Art~colo (Article) Lettera (Letter) Libro (Book) WoBDNET SynsetLabe~ queen-Insect,Queen-Regnant,Queen-Wi~e, Queen-Card, Queen-Chess Article-Artefact,Article-Clause, Article-Grawmar, Article-Document Letter-Missive, Letter-Alphabet Book-Publication, Book-Section,Book-Object Figure 5: Lexical entries for nouns. the possibdity to implement a fast and flexible access to the synsets hierarchy and, in particular, an efficient ISA functionality as required for the semantic checking during the parsing. The arguments to ISA function may be a complex boolean combination of synsets (e.g., see selectional restrictions in figure 4).","The parser controls the overall processing. Whenever it tries to build a (partially recognized) constituent it incrementally verifies the admissibility of the semantic part of such a constituent, using the WORDNET hierarchy. In particular, whenever a noun is associated with a verbal argument the ISA function is triggered to check whether the synset of the noun is subsumed by the selectional restriction of the corresponding verbal argument. Due to the large number of analyses, it is useful to discard unplausible constituents as soon as possible to cut the search space. This has been obtained interliving the syntactic and semantic processes: as soon as the semantic test fails the constituent is rejected. 5"]},{"title":"Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["In this section we describe the empirical results obtained by coupling a WoRDNET based lexicon with a parser In our intention, the experiment would bring evidence for the following aspects:",". Plausibility of WoRDNBT senses for describing a","lexical entries;","e Usability of WoRDNET for carrying out lexical dis-","crimination.","The experiment has been carried out on 60 sentences with 1201 different lectures, and formed by using seven verbs (wr~te, eat, smell, corrode, buy, receive, assocza~e) coupled with fifty common nouns and two proper nouns. In the general experimental setting a sentence is given to the parser in a situation characterized by multiple lexical entries for each single word (one for each WoRDNET sense). The analyses produced by the parser are compared with the set of interpretations given by a human.","As far as nouns are concerned, a lexlcal entry includes all the senses found in Italian WORDNET. Some of the nouns used in the experiment are shown in figure 5. As for verbs, we started from the Italian WoRDNET senses and then we faced to the problem of mdividuatmg the proper selectional restrictions for each argumental position of the verb subcategorization frame as seen before. So we build a small number of lexical entries, by means of which we composed the sentences of the experiment. We experiment the two hypotheses on selectional restrictions presented in section 3, i.e., the one with general WoRDNET frames and the other with more refined selectional restrictions.","As an example, figure 6 shows the output of the parser for the sentence \"La regzna scrtsse ~ma leltera a Gzovanng' (\"The queen wrote a letter to John\"). As a convenction, we decided to describe internal arguments with the symbol '/', while a '//' denotes a verbal adjunct. This sentence was selected because it produces an high number of lectures (40) among the test suite sentences. This is due to both the verb sense ambiguity (write has five senses) and to the noun ambiguitms (queen has five senses, and letter two). Note that the parser excludes the sense Write-Publish since the indirect object must be introduced by the Italian prepositions \"su\" or \"per ~' (in English \"on\" or \"fort'), while in this example we have the preposition \"a\" (\"to\").","Let us first consider the results obtained in the second experimental setting, which best approximate the human judgment. Out of the eight interpretations accepted, two are implausible for a human reader. This caused by the contemporary presence of the sense Letter-Missive and of the proper noun John as, respectively, patient and beneficiary of the write verb sense. Note that, each of these senses are, per se, valid arguments since they satisfy the selectional restrictions.","In the first experimental setting, the presence of weaker selectional restrictions (just ~omebody, Some-thzng) ymlds more spurious readings. As a matter of fact, the more evzdent problem is that many times argumental positions are not properly filled. For example, that \"a queen-Regnant could ~/rlte-Music an Letter-Missive\" (i.e., a kind of correspondence) is one of the allowed readings.","Figure 7 reports the quantitative results of the experiment. They are preliminary since they have been obtained on a limited number of sentences (60). The figure shows, for each experimental setting, the number of total readings produced by the parser, the discrlmination rate (i.e., the rate of the lectures rejected: (1201- z)/1201), and the precision (i.e., the rate of correct lectures: 122/z). These results have to be interpreted considering that the focus of the experiment is on selectional restrictions, which of course is just one among the various kinds of information occurring during lexical discrimination. It is worth mentioning here, among the others, some crucial information sources: (i) 36 Sentence Restrictions Number of lectures Restrictions Number of lectures Restrictions Number of lectures Lectures Human Judgment Number of lectures Lectures La regina scrisse una lettera a Giovanni (THE QUEEN WROTE A LETTER TO JOHN) No semantic discrimination 40 Discrimination with WoRDNET Frames (I exp. setting) 16 Discrimination with WORDNET Full Hierarchy (II exp. setting) 8 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Queen-Wife/Write/Letter-Alphabet//John Queen-Regnant/Write/Letter-Alphabet//John"]},{"title":"(~) (8) 6","paragraphs":["Queen, Regnant/Wfite-Comunicate/Letter-Missive/John (1) Queen-Wife/Write-Comunicate/Letter- Missive/John (2) Queen-Regnant/Writ e-Send/Letter-Missive/John (3) Queen-Wife/Wnte-Send/Letter-Missive/John (4) Queen-Regnant /Write /Let ter- Missive/ / John (5) Queen-Wife/Write/Letter- Missive//John (6) Figure 6: An example of sentence Experimental Setting ~ of lectures [ Discrimination Rate Precision Without discrimination 1201 0% 10% Discrimination with WoRDNET Frames 688 43% 18% Discrimination with the WoRDNET Full Hierarchy 164 86% 74% Human Judgment 122 90% 100% Figure 7: Quantitative results obtained on 60 sentences world knowledge: e.g., it is very strange to Write an Article-Clause on a Newspaper-Periodic; (ii) aspectual properties of the verb: e.g., it is very difficult to interpret La regina sta scmvendo un artscolo sul gzonale (The queen ss wmtmg an article on the newspaper) with the Write-Publish sense, because publishing is a culminative process."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["they are more detailed.","Some general suggestions can be drawn in order to individuate a trade-of between the effort necessary for describing selectional restrictions and the lexical disambiguation obtained. Although the definition of detailed selectional restrictions was highly time comsuming, our experience shown that this approach obtains good results both in the discrimination rate and in the precision. In this paper we presented the approach underlying the Italian WoRDNET, a general computational lexical resource. A prototype has been realized which implements a multilingual lexical matrix. Data acquisition has been mostly manual with the help of a graphical interface. In light of the concrete use of the Italian WORDNET we propose the integration of selectional restrictions into the verbal taxonomy. An empirical verification has been performed which confirms the intuitive hypothesis that selectional restrictions crucially affect lexical disambiguation and that the discrimination rate improves as far as","The experiment also brings evidence for a WORDNET like sense organization. In fact, different selectional restrictions apply to different senses allowing to discriminate among different readings. However, an important drawback in WoRDNET is the lack of relations among related senses of the same word. This is particularly crucial for the logzcal pohsemy cases [Pustejovsky, 1995], when a sense can be generated from another in a predictable way, and, in general, to treat the so called \"verb mutability effect\" as discussed in [Gentner and France, 1988]. 37"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Basili et al., 1996] It.
