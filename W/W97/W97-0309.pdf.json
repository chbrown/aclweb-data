The challenge here arises from the combinatorially large number of possibilities, only a fraction of which can ever be observed. In general, language models must learn to recognize word sequences that are functionally similar but lexically distinct. The learning problem, one of generalizing from sparse data, is particularly acute for large-sized vocabularies (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos, 1992).","The simplest models of natural language are n-gram Markov models. In these models, the probability of each word depends on the n- 1 words that precede it. The problems in estimating robust models of this form are well-documented. The number of parameters--or transition probabilities-- scales as V n, where V is the vocabulary size. For typical models (e.g., n = 3, V = 104), this number exceeds by many orders of magnitude the total number of words in any feasible training corpus.","The transition probabilities in n-gram models are estimated from the counts of word combinations in the training corpus. Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation leads to zero-valued probabilities for unseen n-grams. In practice, one adjusts or smoothes (Chen and Goodman, 1996) the ML estimates so that the language model can generalize to new phrases. Smoothing can be done in many ways--for example, by introducing artificial counts, backing off to lower-order models (Katz, 1987), or combining models by interpolation (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980).","Often a great deal of information:is lost in the smoothing procedure. This is due to the great discrepancy between n-gram models of different order. The goal of this paper is to investigate models that are intermediate, in both size and accuracy, between different order n-gram models. We show that such models can \"intervene\" between different order n-grams in the smoothing procedure. Experimentally, we find that this significantly reduces the perplexity of unseen word combinations.","The language models in this paper were evaluated on the ARPA North American Business News (NAB) corpus. All our experiments used a vocabulary of sixty-thousand words, including tokens for punctuation, sentence boundaries, and an unknown word token standing for all out-of-vocabulary words. The training data consisted of approximately 78 million words (three million sentences); the test data, 13 million words (one-half million sentences). All sentences were drawn randomly without replacement from the NAB corpus.

We describe an iterative algorithm for discovering \"soft\" word classes, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure for maximum likelihood estimation (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, 1977). Several features make this algorithm attractive for large-vocabulary language modeling: it has no tuning parameters, converges monotonically in the log-likelihood, and handles probabilistic constraints in a natural way. The number of classes, C, can be small or large depending on the constraints of the modeler. Varying the number of classes leads to models that are intermediate between unigram (C = 1) and bigram (C = V) models.","In Section 3, we examine another sort of \"intermediate\" model, one that arises from combinations of non-adjacent words.

This is done by interposing these models between different order n-grams in the smoothing procedure. We compare our results to a baseline trigram model that backs off to bigram and unigram models. The use of \"intermediate\" models is found to reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations by over 50%.","In Section 5, we discuss some extensions to these models and some open problems for future research.

Table 4: Words with low and high values of Al(w) in an m = 2 mixed order model. second-order (m = 2) model in Table 3. In this model, a small value for ~l(w) indicates that the word w typically carries less information that the word that precedes it. On the other hand, a large value for Al(w) indicates that the word w is highly predictive. The ability to learn these relationships is confirmed by the results in Table 4. Of the three-hundred most common words, Table 4 shows the fifty with the lowest and highest values of Al(w). Note how low values of Al(w) are associated with prepositions, mid-sentence punctuation marks, and conjunctions, while high values are associated with \"contentful\" words and end-of-sentence markers. (A particularly interesting dichotomy arises for the two forms \"a\" and \"an\" of the indefinite article; the latter, because it always precedes a word that begins with a vowel, is inherently more predictive.) These results underscore the importance of allowing the coefficients Al(w) to depend on the context w, as opposed to being context-independent (Ney, Essen, and Kneser, 1994). 4 Smoothing Smoothing plays an essential role in language models where ML predictions are unreliable for rare events. In n-gram modeling, it is common to adopt a recursive strategy, smoothing bigrams by unigrams, trigrams by bigrams, and so on. Here we adopt a similar strategy, using the (m - 1)th mixed-order model to smooth the ruth one. At the \"root\" of our smoothing procedure, however, lies not a unigram model, but an aggregate Markov model with C > 1 classes. As shown in Section 2, these models assign finite probability to all word combinations, even those that are not observed in the training set. Hence, they can legitimately replace unigrams as the base model in the smoothing procedure.","Let us first examine the impact of replacing unigram models by aggregate models at the root of the C 1 2 4 8 16 32","validation test unseen 163.615 162.982 161.513 161.327 160.034 159.247 167.112 166.193 164.363 164.104 162.686 161.683 293175 259360 200067 190178 164673 150958 Table 5: Perplexities of bigram models smoothed by aggregate Markov models with different numbers of classes (C). smoothing procedure. To this end, a held-out interpolation algorithm (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980) was used to smooth an ML bigram model with the aggregate Markov models from Section 2. The smoothing parameters, one for each row of the bigram transition matrix, were estimated from a validation set the same size as the test set. Table 5 gives the final perplexities on the validation set, the test set, and the unseen bigrams in the test set. Note that smoothing with the C = 32 aggregate Markov model has nearly halved the perplexity of unseen bigrams, as compared to smoothing with the unigram model.","Let us now examine the recursive use of mixed-order models to obtain smoothed probability estimates. Again, a held-out interpolation algorithm was used to smooth the mixed-order Markov models from Section 3. The ruth mixed-order model had mV smoothing parameters 0\"k (w), corresponding to the V rows in each skip-k transition matrix.

On the other hand, the difference in perplexity for higher values of m is not very dramatic.","Our last experiment looked at the smoothing of a trigram model. Our baseline was a ML trigram model that backed off 3 to bigrams (and when necessary, unigrams) using the Katz backoff procedure (Katz, 1987). In this procedure, the predictions of the ML trigram model are discounted by an amount determined by the Good-Turing coefficients; the leftover probability mass is then filled in by the backoff model. We compared this to a trigram model that backed off to the m = 2 model in Table 6. This was handled by a slight variant of the Katz procedure (Dagan, Pereira, and Lee, 1994) in which the mixed-order model substituted for the backoff model.","One advantage of this smoothing procedure is that it is straightforward to assess the performance of different backoff models. Because the backoff models are only consulted for unseen word combinations, the perplexity on these word combinations serves as a reasonable figure-of-merit.","Table 7 shows those perplexities for the two smoothed trigram models (baseline and backoff). The mixed-order smoothing was found to reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations by 51%. Also shown in the table are the perplexities on the entire test set. The overall perplexity decreased by 16%--a significant amount considering that only 24% of the predictions involved unseen word combinations and required backing off from the trigram model.","The models in Table 7 were constructed from all n-grams (1 < n < 3) observed in the training data. Because many n-grams occur very infrequently, a natural question is whether truncated models, which omit low-frequency n-grams from the training set, can perform as well as untruncated ones. The advantage of truncated models is that they do not need to store nearly as many non-zero parameters as untruncated models.

This contrasts with the standard backoff model, in which truncation causes significant increases in perplexity."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["Our results demonstrate the utility of language models that are intermediate in size and accuracy between different order n-gram models. The two models considered in this paper were hidden variable Markov models trained by EM algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. Combinations of intermediate-order models were also investigated by Rosenfeld (1996). His experiments used the 20,000-word vocabulary Wall Street Journal corpus, a predecessor of the NAB corpus. He trained a maximum-entropy model consisting of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, skip-2 bigrams and trigrams; after selecting long-distance bigrams (word triggers) on 38 million words, the model was tested on a held-out 325 thousand word sample. Rosenfeld reported a test-set perplexity of 86, a 19% reduction from the 105 perplexity of a baseline trigram backoff model. In our experiments, the perplexity gain of the mixed-order model ranged from 16% to 22%, depending on the amount of truncation in the trigram model.","While Rosenfeld's results and ours are not di-"]},{"title":"87","paragraphs":["rectly comparable, both demonstrate the utility of mixed-order models. It is worth discussing, how-ever, the different approaches to combining information from non-adjacent words. Unlike the maximum entropy approach, which allows one to combine many non-independent features, ours calls for a careful Markovian decomposition. Rosenfeld argues at length against naive linear combinations in favor of maximum entropy methods. His arguments do not apply to our work for several reasons. First, we use a large number of context-dependent mixing parameters to optimize the overall likelihood of the combined model. Thus, the weighting in eq. (6) ensures that the skip-k predictions are only invoked when the context is appropriate. Second, we adjust the predictions of the skip-k transition matrices (by EM) so that they match the contexts in which they are invoked. Hence, the count-based models are interpolated in a way that is \"consistent\" with their eventual use.","Training efficiency is another issue in evaluating language models. The maximum entropy method requires very long training times: e.g., 200 CPU-days in Rosenfeld's experiments. Our methods require significantly less; for example, we trained the smoothed m = 2 mixed-order model, from start to finish, in less than 12 CPU-hours (while using a larger training corpus). Even accounting for differences in processor speed, this amounts to a significant mismatch in overall training time.","In conclusion, let us mention some open problems for further research. Aggregate Markov models can be viewed as approximating the full bigram transition matrix by a matrix of lower rank. (From eq. (1), it should be clear that the rank of the class-based transition matrix is bounded by the number of classes, C.) As such, there are interesting parallels between Expectation-Maximization (EM), which minimizes the approximation error as measured by the KL divergence, and singular value decomposition (SVD), which minimizes the approximation error as measured by the L2 norm (Press"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1988; Schiitze, 1992). Whereas SVD finds a global minimum in its error measure, however, EM only finds a local one. It would clearly be desirable to improve our understanding of this fundamental problem.","In this paper we have focused on bigram models, but the ideas and algorithms generalize in a straightforward way to higher-order n-grams. Aggregate models based on higher-order n-grams (Brown"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1992) might be able to capture multi-word structures such as noun phrases. Likewise, trigram-based mixed-order models would be useful complements to 4-gram and 5-gram models, which are not uncommon in large-vocabulary language modeling.","A final issue that needs to be addressed is scaling--that is, how the performance of these models depends on the vocabulary size and amount of training data. Generally, one expects that the sparser the data, the more helpful are models that can intervene between different order n-grams. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see exactly how this relationship plays out for aggregate and mixed-order Markov models."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Michael Kearns and Yoram Singer for useful discussions, the anonymous reviewers for ques-tions and suggestions that helped improve the paper, and Don Hindle for help with his language modeling tools, which we used to build the baseline models considered in the paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P.
