Online dictionary entries are used as seed words to generate Word Relation Matrices for the unknown words according to correlation measures. Word Relation Matrices are then mapped across the corpora to find translation pairs. Translation accuracies are around 30% when only the top candidate is counted. Nevertheless, top 20 candidate output give a 50.9% average increase in accuracy on human translator performance. 1 Introduction Despite a surge in research using parallel corpora for various machine translation tasks (Brown","paragraphs":["et al."]},{"title":"1993),(Brown","paragraphs":["et al."]},{"title":"1991; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Simard","paragraphs":["et al."]},{"title":"1992; Chen 1993; Melamed 1995; Wu & Xia 1994; Wu 1994; Smadja","paragraphs":["et aI."]},{"title":"1996), the amount of available bilingual parallel corpora is still relatively small in comparison to the large amount of available monolingual text. It ks unlikely that one can find parallel corpora in any given domain in electronic form. This is a particularly acute problem in language pairs such as Chinese/English or Japanese/English where there are fewer translated texts than in European language pairs. While we should make use of any existing parallel corpora as lexical translation resources, we should not ignore the even larger 192 ! amount of monolingual text. However, using non-parallel corpora for lexical translation has been a daunting task, considered much more difficult than that with parallel corpora. In this paper, we present an initial algorithm for translating technical terms using a pair of non-parallel corpora. Evaluation results show translation precisions at around 30% when only the top candidate is considered. While this precision is lower than that achieved with parallel corpora, we show that top 20 candidate output from our algorithm allows translators to increase their accuracy by 50.9%. In the following sections, we first describe a pair of non-parallel corpora we use for experiments, and then we introduce the Word Relation Matrix (WORM), a statistical word feature representation for technical term translation from non-parallel corpora. We evaluate the effectiveness of this feature with two sets of experiments, using English/English, and English/Japanese non-parallel corpora. 2 Related work Few attempts have been made to explore non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts in the same domain. Early work uses a pair of non-parallel texts for the task of lexical disambiguation between several senses of a word (Dagan 1990). This basic idea extends to choosing a translation among multiple candidates (Dagan & Itai 1994) given collocation information. A similar idea is later applied by (Rapp 1995) to show the plausibility of correlations between words in non-parallel text. He proposed a matrix permutation method matching co-occurrence patterns in two non-parallel texts, but noted that computational limitations hamper further extension of this method. Using the same idea, (Tanaka ~ Iwasaki 1996) demonstrated how to eliminate candidate words in a bilingual dictionary. All the above works point to a certain discriminatory feature in monolingual texts context and word relations. However, these works remain in the realm of solving ambiguities or choosing the best candidate among a small set of possibilities. It is argued in (Gale 8z Church 1994) that feature vectors of 100,000 dimensions are likely to be needed for high resolution discriminant analysis. It is so far questionable whether feature vectors of lower dimensions are discriminating enough for extracting bilingual lex/cal pairs from non-parallel corpora with a large number of candidates. Is it possible to achieve bilingual lex/con translation by looking at words in relation to other words? In this paper, we hope to shed some light on this question. I 3 Two pilot non-parallel corpora In our experiments, we use two sets of non-parallel corpora: (1) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) from 1993 and 1994, divided into two non-overlapping parts. Each resulting English corpus has 10.36M bytes of data. (2) Wall Street Journal in English and Nikkei Financial News in Japanese, from the same time period. The WSJ text contains 49M bytes of data, and the Nikkei 127M bytes. Since the Nikkei is encoded in two-byte Japanese character sets, the latter is equivalent to about 60M bytes of data in English. The English Wall Street Journal non-parallel corpus gives us an easier test set on which to start. The output of this corpus should consist of words matching to themselves as trans-193","paragraphs":["lations. It is useful as a baseline evaluation test set providing an estimate on performance.","The WSJ/Nikkei corpus is the most non-parallel type of corpus. In addition to being written in languages across linguistic families by different journalists, WSJ/Nikkei also share only a limited amount of common topic. The Wall Street Journal tends to focus on U.S. domestic economic and political news, whereas the Nikkei Financial News focuses on economic and political events in Japan and in Asia. Due to the large difference in content, language, writing style, we consider this corpus more difficult than others. However, the result we obtain from this corpus gives us a lower-bound on the performance of our algorithm."]},{"title":"| 4 An algorithm for finding terminology translations from non-parallel corpora","paragraphs":["Bilingual lexicon translation algorithms for parallel corpora in general make use of fixed correlations between a pair of bilingual terms, reflected in their frequent co-occurrences in translated texts, to find lexicon translations.

To avoid problems of polysemy and nonstandardization in dictionary entries, we choose a more reliable, less ambiguous subset of dictionary entries as the seed word list. This subset contains dictionary entries which occur at mid-range frequency in the corpus so that they are more likely to be content words. They must occur in both sides of the non-parallel corpora, and have fewer number of candidate translations. Such seed words serve as the textual anchor points in non-parallel corpora. For example, we obtained 1,416 entries from the Japanese/English online dictionary EDICT using these criteria."]},{"title":"5 A word in relation to seed words","paragraphs":["Word correlations are important statistical information which has been successfully employed to find bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora.
