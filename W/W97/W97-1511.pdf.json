Since there may be more than one rules introduced as alternative hypotheses to recover the analysis of sentences which cannot be parsed by the current grammar, we propose a method to give priority to these hypotheses based on local contextual information. By experiments, our hypothesis selection is evaluated and its effectiveness is shown. 1 Introduction One of the essential tasks to realize an efficient natural language processing system is to construct a broad-coverage and high-accurate grammar. In most of the currently working systems, such grammars have been derived manually by linguists or lexicographers. Unfortunately, this task requires time-consuming skilled effort and, in most cases, the obtained grammars may not be completely satisfactory and frequently fail to cover many unseen sentences. Toward these problems, there were several attempts developed for automatically learning grammars based on rule-based approach(Ootani and Nakagawa, 1995), corpus-based approach(Srill, 1992)(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or hybrid approach(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994b)(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).","Unlike previous works, we have introduced a new framework for grammar development, which is a combination of rule-based and corpus-based approaches where contextual information can be exploited. In this framework, a whole grammar is not acquired from scratch(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or an initial grammar does not need to be assumed(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a). Instead, a rough but effective grammar is learned, in the first place, from a large corpus based on a corpus-based method and then later refined by the way of the combination of rule-based and corpus-based methods. We call the former step of the framework"]},{"title":"partial grammar acquisition","paragraphs":["and the latter"]},{"title":"grammar refinement.","paragraphs":["For the partial grammar acquisition, in our previous works, we have proposed a mechanism to acquire a partial grammar automatically from a bracketed corpus based on local contextual information(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996) and have shown the effectiveness of the derived grammar(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1997). Through some preliminary experiments, we found out that it seems difficult to learn grammar rules which are seldom used in the corpus. This causes by the fact that rarely used rules occupy too few events for us to catch their properties. Therefore in the first step, only grammar rules with relatively high occurrence are first learned.","In this paper, we focus on the second step, grammar refinement, where some new rules can be added to the current grammar in order to accept unparsable sentences. This task is achieved by two components: (1) the rule-based component, which detects incompleteness of the current grammar and generates a set of hypotheses of new rules and (2) the corpus-based component, which selects plausible hypotheses based on local contextual information. In addition, this paper also describes a stochastic parsing model which finds the most likely parse of a sentence and then evaluates the hypothesis selection based on the plausible parse.","In the rest, we give an explanation of our framework and then describe the grammar refinement process and hypothesis selection based on local contextual information. Next, a stochastic parsing model which exploits contextual information is described. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is shown through some experiments investigating the correctness of selected hypotheses and parsing accuracy. 78","2 The Framework of Grammar Development The proposed framework is composed of two phases: partial grammar acquisition and grammar refinement. The graphical representation of the framework is shown in Figure 1. In the process of grammar development, a partial grammar is automatically acquired in the first phase and then it is refined in the second phase. In the latter phase, the system generates new rules and ranks them in the order of priority before displaying a user a list of plausible rules as candidates for refining the grammar. Then the user can select the best one among these rules. Currently, the corpus used for grammar development in the framework is EDR corpus(EDR, 1994) where lexical tags and bracketings are assigned for words and phrase structures of sentences in the corpus respectively but no nonterminal labels are given.

More detail can be found in (Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996). In partial grammar acquisition, a rough grammar is constructed from the corpus based on clustering analysis. As mentioned above, the corpus used is a tagged corpus with phrase structures marked with brackets. At the first place, brackets covering a same sequence of categories, are assumed to have a same nonterminal label. We say they have the same bracket type. The basic idea is to group brackets (bracket types) in a corpus into a number of similar bracket groups. Then the corpus is automatically labeled with some nonterminal labels, and consequently a grammar is acquired. The similarity between any two bracket types is calculated based on divergencel(Harris, 1951) by utilizing local contextual information which is defined as a pair of categories of words immediately before and after a bracket type. This approach was evaluated through some experiments and the obtained result was al-most consistent with that given by human evaluatots. However, in this approach, when the number of occurrences of a bracket type is low, the similarity between this bracket type and other bracket types is not so reliable. Due to this, only bracket types with relatively frequent occurrence are taken into account. To deal with rarely occurred bracket types, we develop the second phase where the system shows some candidates to grammar developers and then they can determine the best one among these candidates, as shown in the next section.","2.2 Grammar Refinement with Additional Hypothesis Rule The grammar acquired in the previous phase is a partial one. It is insufficient for analyzing all sentences in the corpus and then the parser fails to produce any complete parse for some sentences. In order to deal with these unparsable sentences, we modify the conventional chart parser to keep record of all inactive edges as partial parsing results. Two processes are provoked to find the possible plausible interpretations of an unparsable sentence by hypothesizing some new rules and later to add them to the current grammar. These processes are (1) the rule-based process, which detects incompleteness of the current grammar and generates a set of hypotheses of new rules and (2) the corpus-based process, which selects plausible hypotheses based on local contextual information. In the rule-based process, the parser generates partial parses of a sentence as much as possible in bottom-up style under the grammar constraints. Utilizing these parses, the process detects a complete parse of a sentence by starting at top category (i.e., sentence) covering the sentence and then searching down, in top-down manner, to the part of the sentence that cannot form any parse. At this point, a rule is hypothesized. In many cases, there may be several possibilities for hypothesized rules. The corpus-based process, as the second process, uses the probability information from parsable sentences to rank these hypotheses. In this research, local contextual information is taken into account for this task.","1 The effectiveness of divergence for detecting phrase structures in a sentence is also shown in (Brill, 1992). 79 3 Hypothesis Generation When the parser fails to parse a sentence, there exists no inactive edge of category S (sentence) spanning the whole sentence in the parsing result. Then the hypothesis generation process is provoked to find all possible hypotheses in top-down manner by starting at a single hypothesis of the category S covering the whole sentence. This process uses the partial chart constructed during parsing the sentence. This hypothesis generation is similar to one applied in (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a). [Hypothesis generation] An inactive edge [is(A) : xo, xn] can be introduced from x0 to x,, with label A, for each of the hypotheses generated by the following two steps.","1. For each sequence of inactive edges, [is(B1) : xo, x l ] , ..., [ ie( Bn ) : Xn- l , agn ] , spanning from x0 to xn, generate a new rule, A ---, Bz, ..., Bn, and propose a new inactive edge as a hypothesis, [hypo(A) : xo, xn]. (Figure 2(1))","2. For each existing rule A --+ A1, ..., An, find an incomplete sequence of inactive edges, [ie(A1) : xo, xl],...,[ie(ai-1) : xi-2, zi-1], [ie(Ai+l) : xi, xi+l], ..., [ie(An) : xn-z, xn], and call this algorithm for [ie(Ai): xl-z, xl].(Figure 2(2)) (1) B1 Bn 9~D- e- e- (~-~ .... .... .... xO X l Xn. f xn"]},{"title":"# Assumeerule: A ..~ BI .....

In general, among these rules, most of them may be linguistically unnatural. To filter out such unnatural hypotheses, some syntactical criteria are introduced. For example, (1) the maximum number of daughter constituents of a rule is limited to three, (2) a rule with one daughter is not preferred, (3) non-lexical categories are distinguished from lexical categories and then a rule with lexical categories as its mother is not generated. By these simple syntactical constraints, a lot of useless rules can be discarded.","4 Hypothesis Selection with Local Contextual Information Hypothesis selection utilizes information from local context to rank the rule hypotheses generated in the previous phase. In the hypothesis generation, although we use some syntactical constraints to reduce the number of hypotheses of new rules that should be registered into the current grammar, there may still be several candidates remaining. At this point, a scoring mechanism is needed for ranking these candidates and then one can select the best one as the most plausible hypothesis.","This section describes a scoring mechanism which local contextual information can be exploited for this purpose. As mentioned in the previous section, local contextual information referred here is defined as a pair of categories of words immediately before and after the brackets. This information can be used as an environment for characterizing a nonterminal category. The basic idea in hypothesis selection is that the rules with a same nonterminal category as their mother tend to have similar environments. Local contextual information is gathered beforehand from the sentences in the corpus which the current grammar is enough for parsing.","When the parser faces with a sentence which cannot be analyzed by the current grammar, some new rule hypotheses are proposed by the hypothesis generator. Then the mother categories of these rules will be compared by checking the similarity with the local contextual information of categories gathered from the parsable sentences. Here, the most likely category is selected and that rule will be the most plausible candidate. The scoring function (probability p) for a rule hypothesis Cat ---* a is defined as follows.","p(Cat --* ~) -\" p(Cat[l, r) - g(Cat, l, r)","N(l, r) (1) where N(Cat, l, r) is the number of times that Cat is occurred in the environment (l, r). I is the category immediately before Cat and r is the lexical category of the word immediately after Cat. N(l, r) is the number of times that i and r are occurred immediately before and after any categories. Note that because it is not possible for us to calculate the probability of Cat ---+ ot in the environment of (l, r), we estimate this number by the probability that Cat occurs in the environment of (l, r). That is, how easy the category Cat appears under a certain environment (l, r). 80 5 The Stochastic Model This section describes a statistical parsing model which finds the most plausible interpretation of a sentence when a hypothesis is introduced for recovering the parsing process of the sentence. In this problem, there are two components taken into account: a statistical model and parsing process. The model assigns a probability to every candidate parse tree for a sentence.

Thus we estimate its probability by using the formula (1) in section 4.","Similar to most probabilistic models, there is a problem of low-frequency events in this model. Although some statistical NL applications apply backing-off estimation techniques to handle low-frequency events, our model uses a simple interpolation estimation by adding a uniform probability to every events. Moreover, we make use of the geometric mean of the probability instead of the original probability in order to eliminate the effect of the number of rule applications as done in (Magerman and Marcus, 1991).

It is assigned with 0.8 in our experiments. Nrl is the number of rules and Nc is the number of possible contexts, i.e., the left and right categories. The applied parsing algorithm is a simple bottom-up chart parser whose scoring function is based on this model. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to find the Viterbi parse: if there are two proposed constituents which span the same set of words and have the same label, then the lower probability constituent can be safely discarded. 81 6 Experimental Evaluation Some evaluation experiments and their results are described. For the experiments, we use texts from the EDR corpus, where bracketings are given. The subject is 48,100 sentences including around 510,000 words.

The correctness of a hypothesis is defined as follows.","Ranking A/all • At least one of the derivations inside the hy-","pothesis include the brackets which do not cross","with those given in the corpus","• When the hypothesis is applied, it can be used","to form a tree whose brackets do not cross with","those given in the corpus. 6.2 Hypothesis Level Evaluation From 5,083 unparsable sentences, the hypothesis generator can produce some hypotheses for 4,730 sentences (93.1%). After comparing them with the parses in the EDR corpus, the hypothesis sets of 3,127 sentences (61.5 %) include correct hypotheses. Then we consider the sentences for which some correct hypotheses can be generated (i.e., 3,127 sentences) and evaluate our scoring function in selecting the most plausible hypothesis. For each sentence, we rank the generated hypotheses by their preference score according to our scoring function. The result is shown in Table 1. From the table, even though only 12.3 % of the whole generated hypotheses are correct, our hypothesis selection can choose the correct hypothesis for 41.6 % of the whole sentences when the most plausible hypothesis is selected for each sentence. Moreover, 29.8 % of correct hypotheses are ordered at the ranks of 2-5, 24.3 % at the ranks of 6-10 and just only 6.2 % at the ranks of more than 50. This indicates that the hypothesis selection is influential for placing the correct hypotheses at the higher ranks. However, when we consider the top 10 hypotheses, we found out that the accuracy is (1362+3368+3134)/(3217+11288+12846)= 28.8 %. This indicates that there are a lot of hypotheses generated for a sentence. This suggests us to consider the correct hypothesis for each sentence instead of all hypotheses.

The parsing model we consider here is one described in section 5. The chart parser outputs the best parse of the sentence. This parse is formed by using grammar rules and a single rule hypothesis. The result is shown in Table 3. In this evaluation, the PARSEVAL measures as defined in (Black and et al., 1991) are used:","Precision : number of correct brackets in proposed parses Recall = number of brackets in proposed parses","number of correct brackets in proposed parses number of brackets in corpus parses","From this result, we found out that the parser can succeed 57.3 % recall and 65.2 % precision for the short sentences (3-9 words). In this case, the averaged crossings are 1.87 per sentence and the number of sentences with less than 2 crossings is 69.2 % of the comparisons. For long sentences not so much advantage is obtained. However, our parser can achieve 51.4 % recall and 56.3 % precision for all unparsable sentences."]},{"title":"7 Discussion and Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a framework for exploiting contextual information in a process of grammar refinement. In this framework, a rough grammar is first learned from a bracketed corpus and then the grammar is refined by the combination of rule-based and corpus-based methods. Unlike stochastic parsing such as (Magerman, 1995)(Collins, 1996), our approach can parse sentences which fall out the current grammar and suggest the plausible hypothesis rules and the best parses. The grammar is not acquired from scratch like the approaches shown in 82 Sent. Length Comparisons Avg. Sent. Len. Corpus Parses System's Parses Crossings/Sent.

Through some experiments, our method can achieve effective hypothesis selection and parsing accuracy to some extent. As our further work, we are on the way to consider the correctness of the selected hypothesis of the most plausible parses proposed by the parser. Some improvements are needed to grade up the parsing accuracy. Another work is to use an existing grammar, instead of an automatically learned one, to investigate the effectiveness of contextual information. By providing a user interface, this method will be useful for grammar developers. Acknowledgements We would like to thank the EDR organization for permitting us to access the EDR corpus.
