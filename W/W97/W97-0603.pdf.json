We describe the development and in-house testing of the tool, and present the results of ongoing work on testing its generality and objectivity on an external corpus, i.e. an early corpus from the Sundial project in spoken language dialogue systems development."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Spoken language technologies are being viewed as one of the most important next steps towards truly natural interactive systems which are able to communicate with humans the same way that humans communicate with each other. After more than a decade of promises that versatile spoken language dialogue systems (SLDSs) using speaker-independent continuous speech recognition were just around the comer, the first such systems are now in the market place. These developments highlight the needs for novel tools and methods that can support efficient development and evaluation of SLDSs.","There is currently no best practice methodology available which specialises software engineering best practice to the particular purposes of dialogue engineering, that is, to the development and evaluation of SLDSs. In June 1997, a European Concerted Action, DISC (Spoken Language Dialogue Systems and Components - Best Practice in Development and Evaluation), will be launched with the goal of systematically addressing this problem. DISC aims to develop a first detailed and integrated set of development and evaluation methods and procedures (guidelines, checklists, heuristics) for best practice in the field of dialogue engineering as well as a range of much needed dialogue engineering support concepts and software tools. The goals of dialogue engineering include optimisation of the user-friendliness of SLDSs which will ultimately determine their rank among emerging input/output technologies. The present paper will present ongoing work on one of the tools that are planned to result from DISC.","It is a well-recognised fact that the production of a new software engineering tool or method is difficult and time consuming. The difficulties lie not only in the initial conception of, for instance, a new tool, or in tool drafting and early in-house testing. Even if these stages yield encouraging results, there is a long way to go be-fore the tool can stand on its own and be used as an in-tegral part of best practice in the field. One central reason why this is the case is the problem of"]},{"title":"generalisation.","paragraphs":["A tool which only works, or is only known to work, on a single system, in a highly restricted domain of application, or in special circumstances, is of little interest to other developers. In-house testing will inevitably be made on a limited number of systems and application domains and often is subject to other limitations of scope as well. To achieve and demonstrate an acceptable degree of generality, the tool must be iteratively developed and tested on systems and application domains, and in circumstances that are significantly different from those available in-house. Achievement of generality therefore requires access to other systems, corpora and/or development processes. Such access is notoriously difficult to obtain for several reasons, including commercial confidentiality, protection of in-house know-how and protection of developers' time.

It must also have been shown that different developers are able to use the new method or tool with approximately the same result on the same corpus, system or development process. The benefits from using a new tool or method should attach to that tool or method rather than to its originators. 17"]},{"title":",/","paragraphs":["Prior to the start of DISC, we have developed and tested a tool for dialogue design evaluation on an in-house SLDSs project (Bemsen et al. 1996, Bemsen et al. 1997a). The paper will present first test results on the generality and objectivity of this tool called DET (Dialogue Evaluation Tool). Building on the assumption that most, if not all, dialogue design errors can be viewed as problems of non-cooperative system behaviour, DET has two closely related aspects to its use. Firstly, it may be used as part of a methodology for diagnostic evaluation of spoken human-machine dialogue. Following the detection of human-machine miscommunication, DET enables in-depth classification of miscommunication problems that are caused by flawed dialogue design. In addition, the tool supports the repair\" of those problems, preventing their occurrence in future user interactions with the system. Secondly, DET can be used to guide early dialogue design in order to prevent dialogue design errors from occurring in the implemented system. The distinction between use of DET for diagnostic evaluation and as design guide mainly depends on the stage of systems development at which it is being used. When used prior to implementation, DET acts as a design guide; when applied to an implemented system, DET acts as a diagnostic evaluation tool. In what follows, we describe the development and in-house testing of the tool (Section 2), present ongoing work on testing its generality and objectivity (Section 3), and conclude the paper taking a look at the work ahead (Section 4)."]},{"title":"2. Tool Development","paragraphs":["DET was developed in the course of designing, implementing and testing the dialogue model for the Danish dialogue system (Bernsen et al. 1997b). The system is a walk-up-and-use prototype SLDS for over-the-phone ticket reservation for Danish domestic flights. The system's dialogue model was developed using the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) simulation method. Based on the problems of dialogue interaction observed in the WOZ corpus we established a set of guidelines for the design of cooperative spoken dialogue. Each observed problem was considered a case in which the system, in addressing the user, had violated a guideline of cooperative dialogue. The WOZ corpus analysis led to the identification of 14 guidelines of cooperative spoken human-machine dialogue based on analysis of 120 examples of user-system interaction problems. If those guidelines were observed in the design of the system's dialogue behaviour, we assumed, this would increase the smoothness of user-system interaction and reduce the amount of user-initiated meta-communication needed for clarification and repair.","The guidelines were refined and consolidated through comparison with a well-established body of maxims of cooperative human-human dialogue which turned out to"]},{"title":"18","paragraphs":["form a subset of our guidelines (Grice 1975, Bemsen et al. 1996). The resulting 22 guidelines were grouped under seven different aspects of dialogue, such as informativeness and partner asymmetry, and split into generic guidelines and specific guidelines. A generic guideline may subsume one or more specific guidelines which specialise the generic guideline to a certain class of phenomena. The guidelines are presented in Figure 1.","The consolidated guidelines were then tested as a tool for the diagnostic evaluation of a corpus of 57 dialogues collected during a scenario-based, controlled user test of the implemented system. The fact that we had the scenarios meant that problems of dialogue interaction could be objectively detected through comparison between expected (according to the scenario) and actual user-system exchanges. Each detected problem was (a) characterised with respect to its symptom, (b) a diagnosis was made, sometimes through inspection of the log of system module communication, and (c) one or several cures were proposed. The 'cure' part of diagnostic analysis suggests ways of repairing system dialogue behaviour. The diagnostic analysis may demonstrate that new guidelines of cooperative dialogue design must be added, thus enabling continuous assessment of the scope of DET. We found that nearly all dialogue design errors in the user test could be classified as violations of our guidelines. Two specific guidelines on meta-communication, SGI0 and SGI 1, had to be added, however. This was no surprise as meta-comrnunication had not been simulated and thus was mostly absent in the WOZ corpus."]},{"title":"3. Generalising the Tool","paragraphs":["As pointed out in Section 2, success in early tool development is not enough if the aim is to be able to recommend the tool to other SLDS developers on a solid basis. The early development phase focused on one SLDS with one particular dialogue structure, in one particular domain of application, designed for a particular type of task, i.e. reservation, in one particular development phase, i.e. evaluation of an implemented system, and in circumstances of controlled user testing where we had available the scenarios used by the subjects as well as the full design specification of the system. To test and increase the generality of the tool, we are currently applying DET as a dialogue design guide to a WOZ corpus from the Sundial project (Peckham 1993).","Ideally, testing DET on the Sundial corpus will increase the generality that can be claimed for the tool in four different ways: (1) the system dialogue is different from that of the Danish dialogue system; (2) the task type is different, i.e. information vs. reservation; (3) the test type~tool purpose pairs are different: whereas in the case of the Danish dialogue system, DET was used for diagnostic evaluation in a controlled user test, the tool is being used as an early dialogue design guide in the case of Sundial; and (4) circumstances are different because Dialogue GG Aspect No. Group 1: GG I Informativeness GG2 Group 2: GG3 Truth and evidence GG4 Group 3: GG5 Relevance Group 4: GG6 Manner GG7 i Group 5: Partner asymmetry GG8 GG9 GGI0 Group 6: Background knowledge GG11 GG12 Group 7: Repair and clarification GGI3 S G Generic or Specific Guideline No. SG6 i i SG7 *Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).","SG 1 Be fully explicit in communicating to users the commitments they have made.","SG2 Provide feedback on each piece of information provided by the user. *Do not make your contribution more informative than is required. *Do not say what you believe to be false. *Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence. *Be relevant, i.e. be appropriate to the immediate needs at each stage of the transaction. *Avoid obscurity of expression. *Avoid ambiguity.","SG3 Provide same formulation of the same question (or address) to users everywhere in the system's dialogue turns. *Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). *Be orderly. Inform the dialogue partners of important non-normal characteristics which they should take into account in order to behave cooperatively in dialogue. Ensure the feasibility of what is required of them.","SG4 Provide clear and comprehensible communication of what the system can and cannot do.","SG5 Provide clear and sufficient instructions to users on how to interact with the system. Take partners' relevan! background knowledge into account. Take into account possible (and possibly erroneous) user inferences by analogy from related task domains.

Guidelines for cooperative system dialogue. GG means generic guideline. SG means specific guideline. The generic guidelines are expressed at the same level of generality as are the Gricean maxims (marked with an *). Each specific guideline is subsumed by a generic guideline. The left-hand column characterises the aspect of dialogue addressed by each guideline. we do not have the scenarios used in Sundial and do not have access to the early design specification of the Sundial system. IfDET works well under circumstances (4), we shall know more on how to use it for the analysis of corpora produced without scenarios, such as in field tests, or without the scenarios being available.","The important generalisation (4) poses a particular problem of objectivity. When, as in controlled user testing, the scenarios used by subjects are available, it is relatively straightforward to detect the dialogue design errors that are present in the transcribed corpus using objective methods. The objectivity problem then reduces to that of whether different analysers arrive at the same 19 classifications of the identified problems. When, as in many realistic cases in which DET might be used, no scenarios exist or are available, an additional problem arises of whether the corpus analysers are actually able to detect"]},{"title":"the same","paragraphs":["problems in a dialogue prior to classifying them. If not, DET will not necessarily be useless but will be less useful in circumstances in which the objective number of dialogue design errors matters. In the test case, objectivity of detection will have to be based on the empirical fact, if it is a fact, that developers who are well-versed in using the tool actually do detect the same problems. 4.

We would not argue, however, that the delayed feedback strategy is impossible to implement and suecessflally use for flight information systems of the complexity of the intended Sundial system. Still, this complexity is considerable, in particular, perhaps, due to the"]},{"title":"20","paragraphs":["intended ability of the system of distinguishing between timetabled and actual points in time. It is not an easy design task to get the system's dialogue contributions right at all times when this distinction has to be transparently present throughout.","Another point about the corpus worth mentioning is that the simulated system understands the user amazingly well and in many respects behaves just like a human travel agent. The implication is that several of the guidelines in Figure 1, such as GGll/SG6/SG7 on background knowledge, and GG13, SG9/SG10/SGI 1 on meta-communication are not likely to be violated in the transcribed dialogues. It should be added that it is not accidental that exactly these guidelines are not likely to be violated in the transcribed dialogues. The reason is that it is difficult to realistically simulate the limited meta-communication and background-understanding abilities of implemented systems. As to the novice/expert distinction (SG7), this is hardly relevant to sophisticated flight information systems such as the present one. A final guideline which is not likely to be violated in the transcriptions, is SG I on user commitments. The reason simply is that users seeking flight information do not make any commitments: they merely ask for information."]},{"title":"5. Methodology and Results","paragraphs":["The Sundial WOZ corpus comprises approx. 100 flight travel information dialogues concerning British Airways flights. The corpus was produced by 10 subjects who each performed 9 or 10 dialogues based on scenarios selected from a set of 24 scenarios. We do not have these scenarios. The transcriptions came with a header which identifies each dialogue, markup of user and system utterances, consecutive numbering of the lines in each dialogue transcription, and markup of pauses, ahs, hmms and coughs. For the first generality test of DET, we have selected 33 dialogues. Three dialogues were used for initial discussions among the two analysers. The remaining 30 dialogues were split into two sub-corpora of 15 dialogues each. Each sub-corpus was analysed by the two analysers. Methodologically, we analysed each system utterance in isolation as well as in its dialogue context to identify violations of the guidelines. Utterances which reflected one or more dialogue design problems were annotated with indication of the guideline(s) violated and a brief explanation of the problem(s). Using TEI, we have changed the existing markup of utterances to make each utterance unique across the entire corpus. In addition, we have a&led markup for guideline violation. An example is shown in Figure 2.","Having independently analysed the two sub-corpora of 15 dialogues each, the analysers discussed each of the 384 claimed guideline violations and sought to reach consensus on as many classifications-by-guideline as possible.

These figures are not very meaningful in themselves, however, because many identified design guideline violations were identical. This is illustrated in Figure 3 in which the case of offer/give phone no. recurs no less than 8 times. The analysers agreed that the system should always offer 21 the phone number of an alternative information service when it was not itself able to provide the desired information, instead of merely telling users to ring that alternative service. The analysers disagreed, however, on whether the system should start by offering the phone number or provide the phone number right away (of. deb in Figure 3), What we need as SLDS developers is not a tool which tells us many times of the same dialogue design error but a tool which helps us find as many different dialogue design errors as quickly as possible.

This led to a much simpler picture, as shown in Figure 4.","Figure 5 shows the nature of the types of guideline violation referred to in Figure 4 as well as the types that were undecidable, disagreed upon or rejected. It should be noted that the term \"type\" is in this context rather vague. Some of the types of guideline violation in Figure 5 are very important to the design of a habitable human-system spoken dialogue, such as the demand for a more informative opening presentation of what the system can and cannot do, others are of less importance because they appear to be rather special cases, such as when the system offers a phone number to a user who already told the system that s/he had this phone number; some types cover a wealth of different individual cases, such as the many differences in phrasing the same message to the user, others cover just a single case or a number of identical cases; and, of course, some types are more difficult to repair than others. However, common to all these guideline violations is that they should be remedied in the implemented system if at all possible.","Jointly, Figures 4 and 5 show that 15 guideline violation types were found by both analysers, 9 types were found by one analyser only, one type, in fact, a single case, was undecidable on the evidence provided by the transcription, 3 types were disagreed upon, and 6 types were rejected during the consensus discussion, No types were found that demanded revision or extension of the guidelines. The Sundial corpus was analysed by two of the DET tool developers. It cannot be excluded, therefore, that others might in the corpus have found types that demanded revision or extension of the guidelines. This will have to be tested in a future exercise. How-ever, on the evidence provided, the guidelines generalise well to a different dialogue and task type (el. Section 3). We also found that the guidelines generalise well to the different test type~tool purpose pair of the Sundial corpus. In fact, it is not much different to use the guidelines for early evaluation during WOZ and using the guidelines for diagnostic evaluation of an implemented system. In both cases, one works with transcribed data to which the guidelines are then applied.","Turning now to the objectivity or intersubjectivity of the performed analysis, we mentioned earlier that this raises two issues wrt. the Sundial corpus: (a) to which extent do the analysers identify the same cases/types of guideline violation? and (b) to which extent do the analysers classify the identified cases/types in the same way?

This needs further investigation. However, a different consideration is pertinent here. Consider, for instance, analyser A1. A I found the 15 guideline violation types which were also found by A2 plus another 6 guideline violation types. Compared to these 21 types, analyser A2 only managed to add 3 new guideline violation types. Suppose that, on average, either of two expert analysers find equally many guideline violation types not found by the 23 other. In the present case, this number would be 4.5 guideline violation types. A single expert in using the tool would then find 19.5/24 or 81% of the guideline violation types found by two analysers together. Still, we don't know how many new guideline violations a third expert might find and whether we would see rapid convergence towards zero new guideline violations. It would of course be encouraging if this proved to be the case. The 3 types disagreed upon and the 6 rejected types illustrate, we suggest, that dialogue design is not an exact science! Taken together, however, the 4.5 guideline violation types added by the second analyser and the 9 disagreed or rejected types suggest the usefulness of having two different developers applying the tool to a transcribed corpus. Finally, the single undecidable case was one in which the (non-transcribed) prosody of what the user said might have made the difference. Following the system's statement that \"I'm sorry there are no flights leaving Crete today\", the user asked \"did you say there aren't any flights leaving Crete today?\" One analyser took the user's question to be a simple request to have the system's statement repeated, in which case no guideline violation would have been committed by the system. The other analyser took the user's question to be an incredulous request for more information (\"did you say there AREN'T ANY flights leaving Crete today?\"), in which case the system's subsequent reply \"Yes\" would have been a violation of GG 1.","As to (b), Figure 5 shows that the two analysers produced several alternative classifications. It should be noted, however, that the number of these disagreements has been exaggerated by the data abstraction that went into the creation of a small number of types as shown in Figures 4 and 5. In fact, alternative classifications were only made in 7 cases. It appears to be a simple fact that there will always be data on guideline violation which legitimately may be classified in different ways. Depend-ing on the context, the fact that the system says too little about what it can and cannot do can be a violation of either SG4 or SG8. If it says so up front, this is an SG4 but if it later demonstrates that it has said too little, this should be an SG8 but it is comparatively in-nocuous if an analyser happens to classify the violation as an SG4. GG1 (say enough) and GG7 (don't be ambiguous) are sometimes two faces of the same coin: if you don't say enough, what you say may be ambiguous. Similarly GGI (say enough) and GG5 (be relevant), may on occasion be two faces of the same coin: if you don't say enough, what you actually do say may be irrelevant. The same applies to GG2 (superfluous information) and GG5 (relevance): superfluous information may be irrelevant information. SG2 (provide feedback) and GG7 (don't be ambiguous) may also overlap in particular cases: missing feedback on, e.g., time may imply that the utterance becomes ambiguous. Finally, GG6 (avoid obscurity) and GG7 (don't be ambiguous) may on occasion be difficult to distinguish: obscure utterances sometimes lend themselves to a variety of interpretations. 24"]},{"title":"6. Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We find the results reported in this paper encouraging. The tool has generalised well to the Sundial corpus and some amount of objectivity has been demonstrated with respect to type identification and classification. As this was out first attempt at using the tool independently of one another, we intend to repeat the exercise using the insights gained. Two times 15 Sundial dialogues will be used for the purpose. Following that, we plan to repeat the experiment with a small sub-corpus of the Philips corpus which comprises 13.500 field test dialogues conceming train timetable information (Aust et al. 1995). This will add a new dialogue and task type, as well as the new circumstances of a field trial to the generality test of the tool. If and when convincing generality and a satisfactory degree of objectivity in using DET have been achieved, a final transfer problem must be addressed. This problem concerns how to transfer DET to other developers in some \"packaged\" form which does not assume person-to-person tuition. This should enable other SLDS developers to quickly and efficiently learn to use DET at the same level of objectivity as has been achieved during the tests of the tool. Only then will DET be ready for inclusion among the growing number of dialogue engineering best practice development and evaluation tools. As a first step in addressing the transfer problem, we have recently included a DET novice in the team. He is an experienced computational linguist but with little experience in SLDS development. We are investigating what it takes to make him an expert in using DET by having him analyse the same Sundial sub-corpus as was reported on above and we hope that he will participate in the planned second Sundial sub-corpus exercise. Following these steps, the final task will be to define an explicit and simple training scheme for how to become an expert in using the tool.
