In this approach, an output from a speech recognitio n system is passed to a trainable Correction Box module which attempts to locate and repair any transcription errors. The Correction Box consists of a text alignment program, a correction-rule generator, and a series of rule application and verification steps. In the training phase, the correction rules are learned by aligning the recognized speech samples with their original, fully correct versions, on sentence by sentence basis. Misaligned sections give rise to candidate context-free correlation rules, e.g., from ~ frontal ; there were made ~ the remainder, etc. Validation against a text corpus leads to context-sensitive correction rules, such as from view ~ frontal view. The system is applied to medical dictation in the area of clinical radiology."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["In this paper we describe a method of improving the accuracy of automated speech recognition through text-based linguistic post-processing. The basic assumption of our approach is that a majority of transcription errors can be attributed to either some inherent limitations of the language model employed by a speech recognition system, or else to the specific speech patterns of a speaker or a group of speakers. Many advanced speech recognition systems use trainable language models that can be optimized for a particular speaker (speaker-adaptable, or speaker-independent) as well as for a specific sublanguge usage (e.g., radiology). This optimization is necessary to achieve a respectable level of recognition accuracy, however, it may not guarantee consistently high-accuracy performance due to the limited capabilities of the underlying language model, usually a 2- or 3-gram HMMs. Our method is to take a reasonably accurate transcription (perhaps 70-90% word accuracy) and automatically develop a correction filter that would assure","I. This research is based upon work supported in part under a cooperative agreement between the National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Technology Program (under the HITECC contract, number 70NANB5Hl195) and the Healthcare Open Systems and Trials, Inc. consortium. 168 consistently the highest possible performance. Unlike other approaches (e.g., Sekine & Grishman, 1996) that attempt to choose from among alternative transcriptions based on syntactic and/or lexieal well-formedness, our method is to actually identify and correct transcription errors in the SRS output. We would like to stress that while the experiments described in this paper are relatively modest and preliminary, the system we designed is robust and fully automatic: there is no human intervention involved. 2. MOTIVATION In clinical radiology, an on-duty radiologist reviews and reads dozens of images a day: x-ray film as well as digital imagery such as CTIs and MRIs, etc. A radiology department at a medium size hospital handles hundreds of images every day. In a typical situation, an on-call radiologist examines a series of images and dictates his or her findings into a recording device, except in emergency situations where the consultation may be read directly to an attending physician. Voice recordings are then sent for transcription, usually by outsourcing, and return as text reports for the radiologist's signature. The turnaround of this process may take anywhere from a few hours to several days, depending upon the priority of the request, and the efficiency of the transcription service. For a radiologist dictating dozens of reports a day, it is practically impossible to truly verify the transcription arriving for his signature a few days later - that is verify beyond a surface \"makes-sense\" assessment. Therefore, an automated transcription system that can generate a printed report within seconds after being dictated, represents a substantial improvement in quality of this process, while eliminating costly manual labor. The above argument is of course conditioned upon the quality and reliability of automated speech transcription process. It is estimated that a continuous speech recognition system must maintain a consistently very high-level accuracy. [The exact figure is subject to verification in clinical tests currently underway. To give an example: a 95% accurate speech recognition means on average 1 or 2 errors per a brief 20-40 word report]. Today's automated speech recognition systems, while quite advanced, are not sufficiently accurate for this application. We believe, however, that a substantial improvement of automatic transcription quality is possible by augmenting ASR capabilities with natural language processing techniques. Our initial experiments suggest that this may indeed be possible. It remains to be seen whether the resulting system can be used in a real radiology dictation environment. For the experiments reported in this paper, we used a commercially available continuous speech recognition system, equipped with extensive radiology language model based on phoneme- and word-level HMMs, and specifically designed for dictation. Important selection criteria included advertised accuracy (95%), availability, compatibility, user interface type, and cost. 3. OUTLINE OF THE APPROACH The basic premise of our approach is to utilize linguistic and sublanguage-specifie information, even speaker-specific features, in order to improve the accuracy of speech transcription. For the experiments described in this paper, we considered the speech recognition system as a black box, that is, our efforts were directed at correcting the transcription errors in a post-processing mode, 169 rather than to improve the initial transcription. One advantage of this two-pass approach is its independence from any particular SRS, and indeed our Correction Box (C-Box) module can be used as a back-end of any speech system. Nonetheless, there are other possibilities as well, and we mention them briefly in the Future Directions section. The main goal of the C-Box approach is to generate a collection of context-sensitive text-based correction rules, in the form of xt,Y = xq~Â¥, where X and Y are context word patterns, L is a word pattern in an erroneous transcription string, and R is a replacement string correcting transcription errors in L. In order to generate the correction rules we require both training and validation steps to optimize the C-Box performance with respect to a specific sublanguage as well as a speaker or a group of speakers. Therefore, the C-Box approach consists of the following sub-processes: (1) collecting training data, (2) aligning text samples, (3) generating correction rules, (4) validating correction rules, and (5) applying correction rules. 4. DETAILED ALGORITHM In this section we discuss the major steps in the C-Box algorithm. Some further details are discussed in subsequent sections. Step 1. The process is started by collecting a sufficient amount of training text data. The training data must contain parallel text samples: a manually verified true transcription, and the output of the ASR system on the same voice input. We estimate that about a day worth of dictation is sufficient to initiate the training process, some 300 reports or about 150 KBytes of text. In addition, a fair-sized text corpus of historical, fully verified transcriptions is required. In the experiments described in this paper we used about 1000 reports (400 KBytes) of parallel text, plus an additional 5881 correct transcriptions corpus (total 3.25 MBytes). The training was performed on 800 reports, and tested on 200 reports. Step 2. The parallel text samples are aligned, sentence by sentence on the word level This is best achieved using content-word islands, then expanding onto the remaining words, while using some common-sense heuristics in deciding the replacement string correspondences: misaligned sections while different in print, are nonetheless close \"phonetic variants\". We use character-level alignment for support, especially if the replacement scope is uncertain. Additionally, we allow for known spelling variants to align, e.g., 'T' for \"one\", or \"Xray\" for \"X - ray\" or \"X-ray\", etc. Step 3. When a misalignment is detected, the system lexicon is automatically checked for missing words, i.e., we check to see if any given transcription error arose because the speaker had used some word or words that are unknown to the speech recognition system. This is accomplished by looking up the misaligned words in a broad-coverage medical terminology lexicon 1. Since such words will be eventually entered into the SRS lexicon, thus eliminating transcription errors, we decided not to generate correction rules for them, at this time."]},{"title":"Step","paragraphs":["4.

Context-free \"rules\" are derived from perceived differences in alignment of a specific pair of sentences, but they would not necessarily apply elsewhere. Step 5. The candidate rules derived in the previous step are validated by observing their applicability across the training collection (which consists of the parallel text training data as well as a much larger radiology text corpus). To do so, we collect all occurrences of string L in the ASR output (e.g., \"there were made\"), and determine how many times the rule z ~ R is supported in the parallel sample. This gives rise to the support set for a given rule, which we will denote sP(z, ~ R). The remaining occurrences of L constitute the refute set, ~(L ~ R). We also consider substrings of L for validation purposes, e.g.: sl: AT THE TRACK OF TUMOR ON CHANGE IN ... s2: ENDOTRACHEAL TUBES ARE UNCHANGED IN ... can be used to validate the rule on change = unchanged, even though the misaligned sections are much longer here. In fact, one way of proceeding is to work with shorter-L rules first. This in turn leads to breaking down some unwieldy and unlikely candidate rules, such as the one that may arise from aligning two or more consecutive transcription errors together, as illustrated by the above example. The initial validation is based on estimated distribution of L within SP and RF sets, and it may look as follows: L=FUSION COUNT=43 R=EFFUSION R=EFFUSIONS R=EFFUSION OR MIN WEIGHT=0.84 COUNT=41 COUNT= 1 COUNT= 1 This says that the word FUSION has been mistakenly generated 43 times in the training sample of the SRS output, and this constitutes at least 84% of its total observed occurrences. That is, there were 8 other correct occurrences of FUSION within the corpus of all valid reports (i.e.,","43 = 0.s4), and at best all of these would translate correctly when read into the SRS. Out of the 43+8 43 cases, 41 are mistranscripfions of the word EFFUSION, therefore the context-flee rule fusion = effusion could be proposed. This rule is not perfect, since it will potentially mJscorrect other occurrences of FUSION, but its application can be expected to reduce an overall transcription error rate on similar data samples. Step 6. In many cases, clear cut context-free rules, like the one given above axe hard to come by. Clearly, rules with validity weights of 50% or less are useless, but even those below 75-80% may 171 be of little value. One possible way to produce higher quality rules is to specialize them by adding context. In other words, we refine rules by fitting them more closely to the existing evidence. This can be done by identifying contrasting features within the text surrounding L's occurrences that could help us to better differentiate between SP and RF sets. If such a feature or features are found, they will be used to restate t,=~ R as a context-sensitive rule, XLY = XRY, where X and Y are context features. The context is added, initially words, then possibly some non-terminals, one element at a time, on either side of L. The revised rules are re-validated, and the cycle is repeated until no further progress is possible. As an example, consider the following pair of sentences: sl: PORTABLE FROM VIEW OF THE CHEST. S2: PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST. The misalignment gives rise to the context-free correction rule from = frontal. As we validate this rule against the training corpus we find some supporting evidence, but also many cases where the rule can't apply, like the one below: ... ARE UNCHANGED IN POSITION FROM THE PRIOR EXAMINATION. However, adding a one-word context of the word VIEW, i.e., replacing the context-free rule with a context-sensitive from view = frontal view produces a very good correction rule. More advanced possibilities include adding non-terminals to the rules, as in had CD horn = at CD hours, where CD stands for any number (here the word tagged with CD part-of-speech). Step 7. The above process may lead to alignment re-adjustments, as suggested in step 5. Upon re-alignment, additional rules may be postulated, while other rules may be invalidated. This would require another cycle of rule validation. This, again, is repeated until no further progress is possible, that is no further changes to the rule set result. The final set of context-sensitive correction rules is generated. 5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experimental data was obtained from the University of Maryland Medical Center in Balti-more, which is one of the clinical sites used in this project. The validated transcriptions have been extracted from the hospital database by the hospital personnel, and then sanitized to remove any patient information such as names, addresses, etc. At the time this report is written, we collected nearly 7000 transcribed dictations, all in the area of chest X-ray. Chest X-ray is the most prevalent form of radiology, and we decided to start with this sub-area because of its the largest potential practical significance. The sanitized reports were subsequently re-dictated through the automated speech recognition system in order to obtain parallel samples of automated transcription. The redictation was done over a period of several months by a final-year radiology resident at Albany Medical Center, a native North American English speaker. At the time this paper is prepared, some 1000 reports have been redictated. Clinical tests of the system equipped with the C-Box that are starting in early 1997 will provide additional speakers. 172 Generally, we observed significant word error rates in automated speech recognition, in some cases as high as 38%, with the average of 14.3%. This is substantially higher than the advertised 5% error rate. Before starting re-dictation, the speaker underwent a few hours training session, learning how to use the system, and having his voice patterns incorporated into the language model (the system we use is speaker adaptable). The above numbers therefore represent an optimal performance of the system for this speaker, although there are some hard-to-measure mitigating considerations. For example, the radiology reports used in these experiments were read by an AMC resident, who while obviously familiar with the subject matter, also pointed out some fine vocabulary and style differences between AMC and UMMC Baltimore, where the reports were produced. This could potentially have an impact at SRS performance. It should be noted that a typical chest X-ray dictation report is quite short, from a few lines to a few paragraphs, and is dictated quite rapidly in anywhere from 15 seconds to a few minutes. Preliminary experiments with context-free rules have already shown interesting results: we noticed that the average word error rate decreased from 14.3% to 11.3% (a 21% reduction) on a test sample after running it through a C-Box equipped with only a few CF rules. This C-Box was trained on 800 reports (0.3 MByte) and tested on 200 reports (92 KBytes). Below is a sample radiology report, its automated transcription version, and the effect of a partial correction.

OTHER APPROACHES","paragraphs":["Natural language processing techniques have been used before to assist automated speech recognition either in constructing better language models, or as post-processors. For example, part-of-speech information has been used to reduce the overall perplexity of the language model. More advanced linguistic methods include re-ranking N-best sentence hypotheses using syntactic and lexieal well-formedness. A good example is an ongoing effort by Gnshman and Sekine (1994, 1996) at using syntactic parser to pinpoint the correct transcription among the N-best alternatives returned by an SRS. Despite the intuitive appeal of their approach, in which transcribed sentences are re-ranked using the likelihood or degree of syntactic correctness, they have thus far been unable to obtain noticeable reduction of word error rates, partly due to, as they point out, a limited possible range of improvement: one can only improve N-best ranking if there is a better transeription'among them. Other work with NLP-motivated re-ranking of N-best alternative transcription include Rayner et al. (1994), Ostendorf et al. (1991), Norton et al. (1992), among others, and see also (Hirsehman, 1994) and (Moore, 1994) for summary overview. Some alternative possibilities of taking advantage of linguistic information in speech recognition are described by e.g., Kupiec (1992), Murveit and Moore (1990), Maltese and Mancini (1992), and Schwartz et al. (1994). The post-correction approach has been considered by Ringger and Allen (1996), for a different domain (trains scheduling dialog), and using a probabilistie modeling technique rather than correction rules. They report some interesting preliminary results, however these are not directly comparable to ours for two reasons. First, the baseline SRS system used in these experiments is much weaker (only about 58% accurate). Second, the reported improvement cover corrections of vocabulary deficiencies, not only true transcription mistakes due to weaknesses of the language model. It should also be noted here that while the above efforts usually attack the more"]},{"title":"general","paragraphs":["problem of speech understanding accuracy, in an ad-hoc speech production situation (though limited to certain domains such as broadcast news), our solution has been specifically tailored to clinical dictation, and wouldn't necessarily apply elsewhere. Some of the application characteristics that we take advantage of is relatively limited vocabulary (hence smaller training samples), a limited number of speakers (hence speaker independence less critical), and relatively low perplexity of radiology sublanguage (about 20 vs. about 250 for general English as measured for trigram models (Roukos, 1995)). The C-Box approach does not preclude N-Best techniques - in fact we consider this as a natural extension of the present method - one of the obvious limitations of the present approach is the need for parallel training texts, which may be replaced by multiple alternatives. Overall, the C-Box approach is partly related to error-driven learning techniques as used for part-of-speech tagging (Bfill, 1992, 1995), and spelling correction (e.g., Golding & Schabes, 1996). Text alignment methods have been discussed primarily in context of machine translation, (e.g., Brown et. al, 1991; Church, 1993; Chen, 1993) and we draw on these here. Rule validation is based in part on the N-gram weighting method described in (Strzalkowsld & Brandow, 1996). 174"]},{"title":"I 7. CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS","paragraphs":["While we are generally pleased with the initial progress of this work, it is still quite early to draw any definite conclusions whether the C-Box method will prove sufficiently robust and effective in practical applications. For one thing, we have thus far avoided the question of speaker dependence. As described, the C-Box method is clearly speaker dependent, that is, the correction rules need to be learned for each new speaker. It remains to be seen if the present solution is acceptable, and if a degree of speaker independence can be introduced through rule generalization. Further research and evaluations are required with context-sensitive correction rules and various sizes of the training data. At this time it is also an open question how much improvement can be achieved using this method, i.e., if there is an upper bound, and if so what that is. On the face of it, this seems to depend only on how good rules we can get. In practice, we face limits of rule learnability due to sparse data, as well as rule interference (i.e., one rule may undo another, etc.). We plan to study these issues in the near future. There are also other possibilities. Some SRS produce ranked lists of alternative transcriptions (N-Best), which ean be used to further improve the chances of making only the right corrections. Using N-Best sentence hypotheses may also alleviate the need for parallel correct transcriptions in the training sample, as multiple hypotheses can be aligned in order to postulate correction rules. Using multiple SRS in parallel may also increase the likelihood of locating and correcting spurious transcription errors. Finally, we may consider an open-box solution where the information encoded in C-Box rules is fed back into the SRS language model to improve its baseline performance. At this time, we made no attempt to address any of the problems related to spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies and self-repairs (e.g., Oviatt, 1994; Heeman & Allen, 1994). In dictation, where the speaker normally has an option of backing up and re-recording, such things are less of an issue than the word-for-word accuracy of the final transcription, since there are serious liability considerations to be reckoned with.
