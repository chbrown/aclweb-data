On the other hand, handcrafted development of application-dependent grammars is in danger of duplicating work which is then difficult to re-use in other contexts of application. To overcome this problem, we present in this paper a procedure for the automatic extraction of application-tuned consistent subgrammars from proved large-scale generation grammars. The procedure has been implemented for large-scale systemic grammars and builds on the formal equivalence between systemic grammars and typed unification based grammars. Its evaluation for the generation of encyclopedia entries is described, and directions of future development, applicability, and extensions are discussed. 1 1 Introduction Although we have reached a situation in computational linguistics where large coverage grammars are well developed and available in several formal traditions, the use of these research results in actual applications and for application to specific domains is still unsatisfactory. One reason for this is that large-scale grammar specifications incur a seemingly unnecessarily large burden of space and processing time that often does not stand in relation to the simplicity of the particular task. The usual alternatives for natural language generation to date have been the handcrafted development of application or","1This work was partially supported by the DAAD through grant D/96/17139. sublanguage specific grammars or the use of template based generation grammars. In (Busemann, 1996) both approaches are combined resulting in a practical small generation grammar tool. But still the grammars are handwritten or, if extracted from large grammars, must be adapted by hand. In general, both - the template and the handwritten application grammar approach - compromise the idea of a general NLP system architecture with reusable bodies of general linguistic resources.","We argue that this customization bottleneck can be overcome by the automatic extraction of application-tuned consistent generation subgrammars from proved given large-scale grammars. In this paper we present such an automatic subgrammar extraction tool. The underlying procedure is valid for grammars written in typed unification for-malisms; it is here carried out for systemic grammars within the development environment for text generation KPML (Bateman, 1997). The input is a set of semantic specifications covering the intended application. This can either be provided by generating a predefined test suite or be automatically produced by running the particular application during a training phase.","The paper is structured as follows. First, an algorithm for automatic subgrammar extraction for arbitrary systemic grammars will be given, and second the application of the algorithm for generation in the domain of 'encyclopedia entries' will be illustrated. To conclude, we discuss several issues raised by the work described, including its relevance for typed unification based grammar descriptions and the possibilities for further improvements in generation time. 2 Grammar extraction algorithm Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) (Halliday, 1985) is based on the assumption that the differentiation of syntactic phenomena is always deter-46 mined by its function in the communicative context. This functional orientation has lead to the creation of detailed linguistic resources that are characterized by an integrated treatment of content-related, textual and pragmatic aspects. Computational in-stances of systemic grammar are successfully employed in some of the largest and most influential text generation projects--such as, for example, PENMAN (Mann, 1983), COMMUNAL (Fawcett and Tucker, 1990), TECHDOC (KSsner and Stede, 1994), Drafter (Paris and Vander Linden , 1996), and Gist (Not and Stock, 1994).","For our present purposes, however, it is the formal characteristics of systemic grammar and its implementations that are more important.

KPML adopts the processing strategy of the PENMAN system and so it is necessary to briefly describe this strategy.

Passed types are collected and their feature constraints are unified to build a resulting feature structure.

This on its own, however, oversimplifies the real logical relations between the types and would create an inconsistent subgrammar. The problem is the conjunctive inheritance. If the current type occurs in an entry of another system where it is conjunctively bound, a deeper traversal is in fact only licensed if the other types of the conjunctions are chosen as well. In order to perform such a traversal, a breadth traversal with compilation of all crowns of the lattice (see (A~t-Kaci et al., 1989)) would be necessary. In order to avoid this potentially computationally very expensive operation, but not to give up the consistency of the subgrammar, the implemented subgrammar extraction procedure sketched in Figure 1 maintains all systems with complex entries (be they conjunctive or disjunctive) for the subgrammar even if they do not really branch and collapse to a single-subtype system. 2 A related approach can be found in (O'Donnell, 1992) for the extraction of smaller systemic subgrammars for analysis.","If the lexicon is organized as or under a complex type hierarchy, the extraction of an application-tuned lexicon is carried out similarly. This has the effect that closed class words are removed from the lexicon if they are not covered in the application domain. Open class words belonging to word classes not covered by the subgrammar type set are removed. Some applications do not need their own lexicon for open class words because they can be linked to an externally provided domain-specific thesaurus (as is the case for the examples discussed below). In this case, a sublexicon extraction is not necessary.","2 Keeping the disjunctive systems is not necessary for the consistency, but saves multiple raising of one and the same constraint. 49","3 Application for text type 'lexicon biographies' The first trial application of the automatic subgrammar extraction tool has been carried out for an information system with an output component that generates integrated text and graphics. This information system has been developed for the domain of art history and is capable of providing short biography articles for around l0 000 artists. The underlying knowledge base, comprising half a million semantic concepts, includes automatically extracted information from 14 000 encyclopedia articles from McMillans planned publication \"Dictionary of Art\" combined with several additional information sources such as the Getty \"Art and Architecture Thesaurus\"; the application is described in detail in (Kamps et al., 1996). As input the user clicks on an artist name. The system then performs content selection, text planning, text and diagram generation and page layout automatically. Possible output languages are English and German.","The grammar necessary for short biographical articles is, however, naturally much more constrained than that supported by general broil-coverage grammars. There are two main reasons for this: first, because of the relatively fixed text type \"encyclopedia biography\" involved, and second, particularly in the example information system, because of the relatively simple nature of the knowledge base--this does not support more sophisticated text generation as might appear in full encyclopedia articles. Without extensive empirical analysis, one can already state that such a gram:mar is restricted to main clauses, only coordinative complex clauses, and temporal and spatial prepositional phrases. It would probably be possible to produce the generated texts with relatively complex templates and aggregation heuristics: but the full grammars for English and German available in KPML already covered the required linguistic phenomena.","The application of the automatic subgrammar extraction tool to this scenario is as follows.","In the training phase, the information system runs with the full generation grammar.

The resulting extracted subgrammar is a type lattice with only 144 types. The size of the extracted subgrammar is only 11% of that of the original grammar. Run times for sentence generation with this extracted grammar typically range","3This represented the current extent of the knowledge base when the test was performed.

Clause types with more subtypes are likely to cause longer processing times than those with fewer subtypes. When there are in any case fewer subtypes available in the full grammar (as in the existential shown in Table 1), then there will be a less noticeable improvement compared with the extracted grammar. In addition, the run times reflect the fact that the number of queries being asked by choosers has not yet been maximally reduced in the current evaluation. Noting the cumulative set of inquiry responses during the training phase would provide sufficient information for more effective pruning of the extracted choosers.","The second example shows similar improvements. The very short biography entry is appropriate more for figure headings, margin notes, etc. The cumulative type use graph is shown in Figure 3. With this 'smaller' text type, the cumulative use stabilizes very quickly (i.e., after 39 sentences) at 205 types. This remained stable for a test set of 500 sentences. Extracting the corresponding subgrammar yields a grammar involving only 101 types, which is 7% of the original grammar. Sentence generation time is accordingly faster, ranging from 40%-60% of that of the full grammar. In both cases, it is clear that the size of the resulting subgrammar is dramatically reduced. The generation run-time is cut to 2/3. The run-time space requirements are cut similarly. The processing time for subgrammar extraction is less than one minute, and is therefore not a significant issue for improvement. 4 Conclusions and discussion In this paper, we have described how generation resources for restricted applications can be developed drawing on large-scale general generation grammars. This enables both re-use of those resources and progressive growth as new applications are met. The grammar extraction tool then makes it a simple task to extract from the large-scale resources specially tuned subgrammars for particular applications. Our approach shows some similarities to that proposed by (Rayner and Carter, 1996) for improving parsing performance by grammar pruning and specialization with respect to a training corpus. Rule components are 'chunked' and pruned when they are unlikely to contribute to a successful parse. Here we have shown how improvements in generation performance can be achieved for generation grammars by removing parts of the grammar specification that are not used in some particular sublanguage. The extracted grammar is generally known to cover the target sublanguage and so there is no loss of required coverage.","Another motivation for this work is the need for smaller, but not toy-sized, systemic grammars for their experimental compilation into state-of-the-art feature logics. The ready access to consistent subgrammars of arbitrary size given with the automatic subgrammar extraction reported here allows us to investigate further the size to which feature logic representations of systemic grammar can grow while remaining practically usable. The compilation of the full grammar NIGEL has so far only proved possible for CUF (see (Henschel, 1995)), and the resulting type deduction runs too slowly for practical applications.","It is likely that further improvements in generation performance will be achieved when both the grammatical structures and the extracted choosers are pruned. The current results have focused primarily on the improvements brought by reconfiguring the type lattice that defines the grammar. The structures generated are still the 'full' grammatical structures that are produced by the corresponding full grammar: if, however, certain constituent descriptions are always unified (conflated in systemic terminology) then, analogously to (Rayner and Carter, 1996), they are candidates for replacement by a single constituent description in the extracted subgrammar. Moreover, the extracted choosers can also be pruned directly with respect to the sublanguage. Currently the pruning carried 51","improvement sentence worst case 80 best case 1430 average case","run time (in ms) full grammar subgrammar 380 300 3250 1830 ca. 900 ca. 590 310 \"There is Patti Delaroche.\" \"John Foster was born in Liverpool on 1 January c 1787, and he died at Birkenhead on 21 August 1846.\" e.g., \"Mary Moser was an English painter.\" \"George Richmond studied at Royal Academy in 1824.\"","(Under Allegro Common Lisp running on a Sparcl0.) Table 1: Example run times for \"short artist biographies\" out is only that entailed by the type lattice, It is also possible however to maintain a record of the classificatory inquiry responses that are used in a subgrammar: responses that do not occur can then motivate further reductions in the choosers that are kept in the extracted grammar. Evaluation of the improvements in performance that these strategies bring are in progress.","One possible benefit of not pruning the chooser decision trees completely is to provide a fall-back posi-tion for when the input to the generation component in fact strays outside of that expected by the target-ted subgrammar. Paths in the chooser decision tree that do not correspond to types in the subgrammar can be maintained and marked explicitly as 'out of bounds' for that subgrammar. This provides a semantic check that the semantic inputs to the generator remain within the limits inherent in the extracted subgrammar. If it sufficiently clear that these limits will be adhered to, then further extraction will be free of problems. However if the demands of an application change over time, then it is also possible to use the semantic checks to trigger regeneration with the full grammar: this offers improved average throughput while maintaining complete generation. Noting exceptions can also be used to trigger new subgrammar extractions to adapt to the new applications demands. A number of strategies therefore present themselves for incorporatiug grammar extraction into the application development cycle.","Although we have focused here on run-time improvements, it is clear that the grammar extraction tool has other possible uses. For example, the existence of small grammars is one important contribution to providing teaching materials. Also, the ability to extract consistent subcomponents should make it more straightforward to combine grammar fragments as required for particular needs. Further validation in both areas forms part of our ongoing research. Moreover, a significantly larger reduction of the type lattice can be expected by starting not from the cumulative set of goal-types for the grammar reduction, but from a detailed protocol of jointly used types for every generated sentence of the training corpus. A clustering technique applied to such a protocol is under development.","Finally, the proposed procedure is not bound to systemic grammar and can also be used to extract common typed unification subgrammars. Here, however, the gain will probably not be as remarkable as in systemic grammar. The universal principles of, for example, an HPSG cannot be excised. HPSG type hierarchies usually contain mainly general types, so that they will not be affected substantially. In the end, the degree of improvement achieved depends on the extent to which a grammar explicitly includes in its type hierarchy distinctions that are fine enough to vary depending on text type."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Hassan Ai't-Kaci, Robert Boyer, Patrick Lincoln, and Roger Nasr. 1989.
