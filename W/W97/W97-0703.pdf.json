Abstract We investigate one techmque to produce a summary of an original text without requmng zts full semanttc interpretation, but instead relying on a model of the topic progresston m the text derived from lexlcal chains We present a new algonthm to compute lexlcal chains m a text, merging several robust knowledge sources the WordNet thesaurus, a part-of-speech tagger and shallow parser for
