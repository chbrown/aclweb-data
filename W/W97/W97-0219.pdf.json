We will address a number of fundamental questions, including: • What are the different types of information that we want to tag? • How can information in a structured lexicon facilitate tagging tasks?","• How long does it take to build a structured lexicon with the relevant pieces? Can automatic procedures be used for the construction of lexical representations? What existing resources should we be using and what aids do we have to transform these resources into appropriate representations?","• What lexicai levels are required in a lexicon? Syntactic? Lexical semantic? Aspectual? Ontological? Deeper Knowledge?","- What do the representations at each of these levels look like like, and how would they be constructed?","- What are the interdependencies between these levels? Can we take advantage of interacting linguistic constraints from each level for the development of structured lexicons? Should the levels be kept as separate layers and related explicitly or should they be combined into one layer and be related implicitly? We will also address related questions, including:","• How much of what we can tag is context-dependent? What tags can only be compositionaily derived during the corpus tagging process?"]},{"title":"2 Format","paragraphs":["Participants will be asked to respond to one or more of the issues above by March 20th. Please use ascii, and send your responses by email to Mari Olsen, molsen~umiacs.umd.edu. We will distribute participant responses to all respondents by email. We will select a facilitator for the most heavily addressed issues. During the session, we will break up into working groups, discuss the issues, and reconvene for a brief presentation from each working group."]},{"title":"93","paragraphs":[]}]}
