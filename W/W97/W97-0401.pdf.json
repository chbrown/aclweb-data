Different languages have evolved different conventions on using such particles, which renders the task for spoken language translation quite difficult. We focus here on particles in German, suggest a framework for represent-ing their roles in utterances, and sketch an approach for adequately translating them into English."]},{"title":"1 Overview","paragraphs":["Discourse particles at first sight seem to be innocent little words, but they can pose significant problems for automatically processing spoken language. Their abundance (types and tokens alike) varies no-tably from language to language. In this paper we are concerned with German and English; in the for-mer, a particularly large number of such particles is in use. In the next section, we demonstrate that these particles can be quite problematic in translation, drawing on extensive corpus analyses we performed in the VERBMOBIL project [Wahlster 1993]; thus our examples are all from the domain of appointment scheduling. Thereafter, we discuss the consequences for automatic spoken language translation (SLT) and suggest a framework of discourse functions to adequately represent the role of the particles within utterances. We then point out that certain routine formulas can be tackled with the description of discourse functions as well. Finally, we discuss how our inventory of discourse functions can be used to improve translation quality in an SLT system such as VERBMOBIL."]},{"title":"2 Discourse particles: a rich source of ambiguity","paragraphs":["Discourse particles are words that are not uttered because of their propositional content, but because of some pragmatic function for the ongoing discourse. Imagine, for instance, utterance (1) in the midst of a discussion; the right at the beginning serves mainly to signal turn-taking and initiating some kind of break in the conversation.","(1) Right, now let's turn to the next topic.","The exact function of a discourse particle is often difficult to determine, though, and thus the need for disambiguation arises: In the German utterance (2), which can be roughly translated as So we're finished, theja can be a mere filler that smoothens the intonation contour, or it can mark the overall information as given, e.g. in a situation where the participants have just collectively closed off the final topic.","(2) Dann sind wir ja fertig.","The disambiguation problem is aggravated considerably by the fact that the vast majority of words that can be used as discourse particles also have a \"standard\", lexically-determined, reading) In (1), the now can be read as a temporal adverb or as a semantically empty particle. Similarly, in (2) the dann is most likely just an 'uptake' particle, but in general it is a temporal adverb as well.","We will follow the terminology of Hirschberg and Litman [1993], who distinguish between the sentential usage and the discourse usage of such words. Ill these terms, the problem is that many particles have a sentential usage, but it may very well be irrelevant, in certain contexts, where only the discourse usage of the particle is relevant -- and often that. usage has no systematic relationship to the sentential usage.","1Exceptions are, for instance, the English oh or the German ach, which are always discourse particles."]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["Several studies of English discourse particles have suggested that utterance-initial position is the central criterion to distinguish sentential from discourse reading (e.g., Reichman [1985]), and certainly, adopting such a criterion makes it much easier to gather and evaluate the data (cf. Byron and Heeman [1997]). The position-criterion, however, holds for a certain class of discourse particles at best. Hirschberg and Litman [1993] give some counter-examples to the hypothesis. Furthermore, it does not travel well to the German language, despite tile fact that Ripplinger and Alexandersson [1996] also give the utterance-initial criterion for identifying German discourse particles, such as denn, also, ja, in the VERBMOBIL corpus. In fact, these and other particles can occur almost everywhere in the utterance.","For this and other reasons, the class of discourse particles is a heterogeneous one and very difficult to demarcate in syntactic or other formal ways. Schiffrin [1987, p.31ff] develops a lengthy defini-tion of units of talk and then treats discourse particles (markers in her terminology) as bracketing such units. For our purposes here, we do not attempt to give formal criteria for what constitutes a discourse particle; instead we are content with the functional, dual-usage description. This results from taking a rather broad perspective on the range of functions of discourse particles, which will be developed in section 3.","For the task of translating utterances containing discourse particles, the monolingual ambiguity problem is extended by that of finding an appropriate translation -- and different languages have developed quite different conventions for using particles. German is known to offer an especially wide range of discourse particles, and therefore it is not surprising that many of them do not have any straightforward English translation at all -- instead, their function in discourse needs to be signalled by different means. And in many cases a particle is best dropped from the translation process altogether, if its existence is due merely to certain conventions in spoken German, which do not carry over to the target language. 2 The problem is, given a particular utterance containing a particle, to tell which case is at hand.","~Furthermore, the problem is amplified by the fact that German particles can be combined to form conglomerates, as in Wir sollten wohl doch noch rnal einen Terrnin ausrnachen. To what extent these can be an-alyzed and translated compositionally is an open quest.ion. In the present paper, though, we deal only with individual part.icles. 2.1 German examples","The VERBMOBIL system currently operates with a","German vocabulary of 2300 words, and among these","we have identified 49 particles that cause problems","of the kind just described. (This figure does not","include modal and other particles that can pose sig-","nificant problems for translation but do not have a","discourse usage.) Although we have not performed","large-scale frequency tests, some initial counts sug-","gest that a typical dialogue from the VERBMOBIL","corpus, which consists of about 15 turns, contains 20","to 30 occurrences of such particles. For this paper,","we have chosen 7 particles to illustrate the situation","for disambiguation and translation. doch If Doch. t is the sole response to an ut-","terance, dochl denies what the other participant","has just said and at the same time reaffirms the","(opposite) opinion of the speaker. In English, one","would say something like Yes it is! (or use the more","specific verb in question). However, when doch is","used within a sentence, it has at least the following","three functions. In Das ist doch klar, doch~ signals","that the proposition is assumed to be shared knowl-","edge, or self-evident. A suitable English rendering","is That's clear anyway. (3) Lassen Sie uns doch einen Terrain ausmachen. But when a sentence like (3) introduces an ex-","change, doch3 merely smoothens the utterance and","should not be translated at all, since English does","not offer a corresponding word. Thus, a translation","is Let us arrange an appointment. (4) Dann nehmen wir DOCH Dienstag. Finally, in an utterance like (4), where doch4 is","prosodically marked, it signals a return to a previ-","ous state of the negotiation: Tuesday had been sug-","gested earlier but was rejected, and now the rejection","is taken back. Again, there is no equivalent English","word; instead, a speaker can signal the reversal of","her position by saying, for instance, All right, so we","DO take Tuesday. noch Another example is noch, which can be a","semantically empty smoothening particle, or a focus","particle meaning another. (5) Wir miissen noch einen Terrain ausmachen. Sentence (5) is ambiguous between We have to","arrange an appointment and We have to arrange","another appointment. Often, prosody indicates the","distinction [Bos et al. 1995]; otherwise, analysis of","the preceding context is necessary: Has a different","appointment been scheduled already, so that another","one can be dealt with now? also The \"literal\" meaning (according to dictio-","naries) of also1 is therefore or so. 3 In a related usage,","also2 can introduce a reformulation or specification","of information: (6) Treffen wir uns am Dienstag, also am dritten","Juni. Sentence (6) can be translated as Let us meet on","Tuesday, hence on the third of June (the more formal","therefore would be misplaced here). (7) Also, da muss ich real schauen. However, in (7), alsoa does not contribute to sen-","tence meaning but merely signals that the speaker","is taking her turn. In English, this is typically per-","formed by now, ... or well, ..., etc. bitte Sometimes, the dialogue act of the preced-","ing utterance can be the decisive piece of informa-","tion for disambiguation. The single-word utterance","bitte is ambiguous between you're welcome! and ex-","cuse me?, asking the other participant to repeat the","utterance. Now, in case the dialogue act of the pre-","ceding utterance is THANK (which abstracts over","the various linguistic means of expressing gratitude),","bitte is translated as you're welcome. (Prosodic in-","formation can also help to distinguish the two forms","of bitte, but is not always reliable.) beziehungsweise This is a curious German word","that can be employed for quite a variety of purposes. (8) Mir passt es am Dienstag beziehungsweise am","Freitag gut. For example, in (8) the speaker lists two alterna-","tives, so that beziehungsweisel is best translated as","or, thus: For me, Tuesday or Friday is fine. (9) lch bin am Dienstag und Mittwoch, also am","dritten beziehungsweise am vierten, in Hamburg. In an enumeration with specification, such as","(9), the English and ... respectively is an ade-","quate translation for beziehungsweise2; only in this","case, a relation between different elements is ver-","balized, which is part of the \"literal\" meaning of","beziehungsweise. It requires a certain amount of","reasoning, though, to notice this relation between","'Tuesday' and 'third', and between 'Wednesday' and","'fourth', so that the translation I am in Hamburg","on Tuesday and Wednesday, hence on the third and","fourth, respectively is achieved. (10) Am Montag bin ich in Frankfurt, beziehungs-","weise in Eschborn. Often, however, beziehungsweise3 merely starts a","self-correction, specification, or reformulation, best","translated as or rather, as in (10): On Monday I am","in Frankfurt, or rather in Eschborn. (Eschborn is a","smaller town neighbouring Frankfurt).","3Notice that German also has no relationship to English also -- they are genuine false friends.","vielleicht Dictionaries give the meaning maybe for this adverb, but in spoken language it is often produced merely as a filler word, partly indicating vagueness, partly buying time for the speaker to do more thinking. In (11), the vielleicht2 is to be treated as such a filler; the literal translation Then let us maybe say Tuesday is unnatural.","(11) Dann sagen wir vielleicht am Dienstag.","ja As a complete utterance, the meaning ofja is quite significant ('yes'), but as a little word accompanying utterances it can be used for many, often less significant, purposes. For instance, it can serve as a simple uptake, similar to alsoa; or it can be a plain filler that should not be translated at all; or it can indicate that the speaker assumes something to be presupposed by the hearer as well -- in a negotiation, someone would say (12) if he had already given the information On Monday I am in Hamburg earlier.","(12) Montag bin ich ja in Hamburg. 2.2 English examples In English, particles are generally less frequent than in German. Correspondingly, using particles for discourse purposes is also less common than in German. While we have not done comprehensive corpus studies on English data yet, the limited role of particles can be inferred from the fact that the research literature often deals merely with those occurring utterance-initial (e.g., [Byron, Heeman 1997]). Especially the structuring particles are well-studied; for instance, by the way and but can signal the beginning of a digression, and anyway the return to a previous topic.","Other prominent utterance-initial particles are those that signal turn-taking (we call them 'uptakes'), as in (13) and (14), taken from the English VERBMOmL data. In (14), the well is not just a neutral uptake but also indicates reservation.","(13) Alright, why don't you come to my of/ice.","(14) Well, the morning of the eighteenth is bad.","Some studies look at particles in other positions as well. For instance, Redeker [1990] considers utterance-final tags like okay? or right?, which serve to elicit acknowledgement from the listener, and comment-clauses, which can be used as 'enquoting devices' to signal the beginning of quoted speech.","Other particles, which we also find in the English VERBMOBIL data, include repair markers such as the oh in (15) and the no in (16). Incidentally, (16) is an example for a correction that does not pertain to the part of the utterance immediately preceding the correction marker.","(15) I'm going to be in Cleveland on the sixth, discourse function structuring coherence-marking attitudinal push pop uptake check repair, positive negative indifferent given surprise smoothening filler Figure 1: Taxonomy of discourse functions how about sometime, oh, actually maybe this week isn't going to be so good.","(16) I'm on vacation from the second to the twelfth, I'm going to see the Grand Canyon, no, actually to the fifteenth. 2.3 Consequences for automatic translation Summarizing the examples given above, a particle can have","Â• a \"literal\" lexical translation, where semantics (truth conditions) is relevant (there can still be ambiguity between several sentential readings),","* a \"non-literal\" lexical translation, where pragmatic intent is relevant (again, there can be ambiguity between several discourse readings),","Â• a non-lexical translation, i.e., it is rendered by a syntactic or intonation feature, Â• a zero translation. For some particles, only a subset of these cases is possible, but others can, depending on context, fall into any of these groups, such as the notorious ja.","Moreover, we have seen that a variety of knowledge sources is required to find the adequate translation: Â• syntactic environment (e.g., for ja), . semantic types, Â• previous utterance (e.g., for doch), Â• preceding discourse (e.g., for noch),","Â• world knowledge and/or inferences (e.g., for bezieh ungsweise) , Â• prosody (e.g., for bitte),","Â• genre-specific conventions (see example below in section 4).","Given this situation, it is unrealistic to expect that a set of standard transfer rules is sufficient to provide adequate translations of particles on a lexical basis. Instead, a \"deeper\" analysis is required, which extracts sufficient contextual information and also, if necessary, can bring world knowledge into play. Similarly, on the side of the target language, the best realization corresponding to a source language particle is not always straightforward to determine. This is another argument against relying solely on transfer rules, especially if the realization is an intonation feature or syntactic tag whose position is not immediately related to that of the source language particle."]},{"title":"3 Discourse functions","paragraphs":["In"]},{"title":"VERBMOBIL,","paragraphs":["the \"deep\" analysis is undertaken in the Context Evaluation (ConEval) module, which constructs a conceptual representation (based on a domain model coded in a description logic language) from the output of the syntactic/semantic analysis module. The conceptual representation is used to compute the dialogue act [Schmitz, Quantz 1995] and to perform various disambiguations [Stede et al. 1996], which can involve inferences. For example, we reason with date expressions to determine whether one date is a specification of another, or a separate one (which is sometimes important for disambiguation).","In our conceptual representation, the discourse particles (in their \"pragmatic reading\") are represented by labels signifying their discourse function. Figure 1 shows our current taxonomy of discourse functions (an extension of the one given in [Schmitz, Fischer 1995]), which has resulted from extensive corpus analyses of the VERBMOBIL data and from examining the relevant research literature. In the following, we briefly explain the various functions.","Structuring These functions have received the most attention in the research literature. PUSH and POP mark the beginning of a sub-topic or digression, and the return to the previous topic, respectively. (Examples: by the way-anyway / davon abgesehen-wie auch immer). With an UPTAKE, the speaker signals a turn-taking at the beginning of a turn and a turn-holding within a turn. It also can help the hearer adapting to the acoustic properties of the speaker's utterance without losing information. (Examples: all right, now/ja, also). CHECK is a turn yielding signal, prompting the dialogue partner to respond. By using a CHECK, the speaker often seeks approving feedback from the hearer. (Example: isn't it? / oder?). REPAIR indicates problems in planning and performing the output, signals a new start, and thereby is also a turn-holding signal. (Examples: I mean, sorry / ach nein, Â£h).","Coherence Marking Some particles can be employed to facilitate the embedding of the utterance within the context, and to check the common basis of the participants. (Example: doch, schon).","Attitudinal We borrowed this label from All-wood et al. [1992]. While English often uses verbs for these purposes, German also offers a range of particles for speakers to convey a POSITIVE (example: gem), NEGATIVE (example: leider), or INDIFFERENT (example: ruhig) attitude towards the propositional content in their utterance, or towards the last utterance of the dialogue partner. In addi-tion, the propositional content of the speaker's own utterance can be marked as presupposed, or GIVEN (examples: ja, doch). And, some particles indicate SURPRISE at an utterance made by the partner (example: oh).","Smoothening Also especially in German, particles often help to create an overall appropriate intonation contour, and at the same time can serve to express cooperativity and politeness (Examples: denn, doch). Specifically, FILLERS allow the speaker to plan the output, avoid undue pauses, and help to hold the turn. (Examples: ich wiirde sagen, Â£h)."]},{"title":"4 Routine formulas","paragraphs":["We pointed out that the particles investigated here have at least one reading in which the discourse usage is central to their usage, and not semantic contribution to propositional content. This difference points to the notion of \"idiomatic\" meaning, and -- not surprisingly -- the discourse functions introduced above can often also be realized by idiomatic phrases. Without going into detail here, we merely give a few examples, again taken from the VERBMOBIL domain. In all these cases (and many others), the \"literal\" compositional meaning is not the point of using the phrase, and they typically cannot be translated word-by-word.","As fillers, we often find phrases like lch wiirde denken .... or Ich muff sagen, ... In English, the translation I must say, ... is not wrong but not conventionally used in this context. Similarly, the German Wenn ich da real nachsehe, ... should not be translated preserving the conditionality, hence If I look this up, ... but by the common phrase Let me see, ...","The function check can be realized by phrases like Sehe ich das richtig? which also should not be translated literally (Do I see that correctly?) but by a conventional phrase such as Am I right?","repair markers can also be phrasal, as in X, oder besser gesagt, Y or in X, nein, ich wollte sagen Y. Again, literal translations should give way to conventionalized English formulas, hence X, no, I wanted to say Y is less felicitous than X, no, I meant Y."]},{"title":"5 Towards automatic translation","paragraphs":["Since the problems associated with discourse particles are largely absent when processing written language, computational linguistics has for most of its history not dealt with these problems. In SLT, how-ever, they cannot be avoided, especially when working with a language rich in particles, such as German. Given the youth of the field, plus the fact that particles at first sight do not exactly seem to be the most important challenge for translating spoken language, it comes as no surprise that there are no satisfactory solutions in implemented systems yet.","In the VERBMOBIL prototype that was completed last year, a number of particles are considered ambiguous between scopal/modal/focusing adverb on the one hand, and \"pragmatic adverb\" on the other. This class of \"pragmatic adverbs\" loosely corresponds to the \"discourse usage\" we have investigated above. The translation framework of VERBMOBIL is strongly lexeme-based; thus, for any particle in the German source-utterance, the transfer component seeks a corresponding English word on the basis of the reading determined. Typically, the ConEval module is asked to determine the class of a particle, wherupon transfer chooses a target word. As an exception, in some contexts a pragmatic adverb is suppressed in the translation.","This procedure is a start, but it cannot deal with all the facets of meaning found in discourse particles, as outlined above. On the basis of corpus studies, both [Schmitz, Fischer 1995] and [Ripplinger, Alexandersson 1996] already demonstrated that many German particles have a whole range of English correspondents, of which VER.BMOBIL at present manages only very few.","To improve the translations, for the second phase"]},{"title":"7","paragraphs":["of the VERBMOBIL project we propose to build upon the framework of discourse functions.

The decision as","to what discourse function to associate with a par-","ticle is seldom a strict one (not even for the human","analyst). Instead, the different clues from syntax,","semantics, prosodb;i and world knowledge are typ-","ically weak and have to be weighted against each","other in the light of the complete utterance. There-","fore, we tackle the problem with the same mech-","anism we use for identifying dialogue acts: a set","of weighted default rules, implemented in FLEX","[Quantz et al. 1996] as an extension to the standard","description logic language.
