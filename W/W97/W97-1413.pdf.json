Introduction","paragraphs":["In the domain of natural language understanding and more precisely man-machine dialogue design, there are usually two trends of research which seem to be rather differentiated. On the one hand, many studies have tackled the problem of interpreting spatial references expressed in verbal utterances, focusing in particular on the different geometric or functionnal constraints which are bound to the existance of a \"source\" (or site) element in relation to which a 'target\" is being situated. Such studies are usually based upon fine grained linguistic descriptions for different languages (Vandeloise, 1986). On the other hand, the problem raised by the integration of a gestural mode within classical NL interfaces has yielded some specific research about the association of demonstrative or deictic Nps together with designations, as initited by Bolt some two decades ago (cf. Thorisson et alii, 1992; Bellalem and Romary, 1995). Our aim in this paper is to show that the different phenomena described in the context of spatial reference or multimodal interaction should not necessarily be considered as two independant issues, but should rather be analysed in a unified way to account for the fact that they are both based on linguistic and perceptual data. As a matter of fact, if we consider a situation of man-machine dialogue where the user is presented with a graphical representation of his task, it is clear that, given a certain informational content he wants to convey, h e will essentially choose a referring mode which seems most relevant in the current communicative situation. For example, if we consider a graphical situation such as that described in figure 1.1, he may either use"]},{"title":"the black triangle, this triangle","paragraphs":["(+ pointing gesture),"]},{"title":"the leftmost triangle","paragraphs":["to refer to the left most object, and it would be quite annoying to consider these different expressions as corresponding to uncomparable referring modes 1."]},{"title":"Â© Figure 1.1","paragraphs":["In this context, we will try to show how language, gesture and perception can be seen in a uniform way from the perspective of referential analysis, even if doing so we will have to look at the specific constraints which underly the speaker's choice of a given expression. To this end, we will first quickly situate the relative importance of speech and gesture in man-machine communication. Then, we will concentrate upc~ the specific effects resulting from the combination of verbal, gestural and perceptual information, showing that on the one hand the three provide structural constraints to the objects which are being referred to and on the other hand that any referring operation, whatever its origin, has to be interpreted within a localized frame, with some consequences upon dialogue management. 2."]},{"title":"Several means to make a referring act","paragraphs":["When designating a given object within a visual environment, it seem at first sight that Natural Language provides uncomparable means to do so as opposed to gesture. Beyond the different determiners which are present in most natural languages either explicitely or implicitely (indefinite, definite or demonstrative), nominal categories allows one to set the proper level of granularity corresponding to the intended object. Indeed, in a situation where a gesture would be ambiguous and point to the overall scene (a set of geometrical shapes), a specific i In particular, gricean maxims as well as relevance theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1986) would tend towards an analysis which compare the different referring expressions in terms of cognitive cost."]},{"title":"Constraints on the Use of Language, Gesture and Speech for Multimodal Dialogues 95","paragraphs":["object (a triangle) or any of its part (a segment, a point etc.), the sole phrase"]},{"title":"the triangle","paragraphs":["may directly designate what is being intended.

Reference and contrast","paragraphs":["The schematic algorithm used in most dialogue systems in order to deal with referential NPs (in the case they get their reference within a context which is visually presented) can be expressed as: a) get all the indices from the expression; b) deduce from these indices some constraints which must be true in the visual representation; c) filter the referent(s) thanks to these constraints. In such a framework, what would be expected as the system's perceptuel abilities boils down to an ability to build the set of objects appearing on the screen.

If a dialogue system has to understand such expressions as those we mentioned so far, h e therefore should perceive its environment on a more \"user compatible\" basis. We suggest at least that perceptual contrasts should be taken into account in order to structure the set of visible objects. When no contrast pre-exists which would directly support an intended reference, we mentioned the possibility to build a group on the basis of individuals by such an explicit expression as \"the two leftmost triangles\". A corresponding solution in terms of demonstrative use would be something like this triangle and this one (or these two triangles) together with two pointing gestures. Another solution consists in building the contrast by means of a \"peripheral designation\" which justifies our claim about considering perception and designation on a unified constrastive basis. In order to argue that claim, we will now re-consider gestures almost independantly from the referential expressions they accompany."]},{"title":"4. Gesture and contrast","paragraphs":["Our analysis of demonstrative and definite NPs (when referring within a perceptual environment) relies on perceptually founded contrasts. The required precision of a designation gesture therefore depends upon these perceptive constrasts. In such an example as: relies on the same kind of horizontal discrimination: the only difference with the preceeding example is that we refer to a cohesive group. The horizontal discrimination identifies here two groups from which gesture only has to select one. However, such situations as: do not provide any perceptual grouping of something which would correspond to \"the upper and the righmost triangles in the left group of three\". If the user intends to refer to these two triangles, he has to build a discrimination into the group. A possible gesture to do that is depicted bellow: Such \"peripheral\" designations take up for the absence of a shared perceptual feature (such colour), as it both gather up the two objects and put them into focus. The analysis of the whole intervention (the gesture plus the NP \"these triangles\") is then of the same kind as its equivalent in 2.3.b. As such, we clearly see here that gesture, instead of just being another mtxte of communication, [] pertains to the same domain as perceptual information. [] Our analysis so far can thus be summarized as \" the gesture only has to separate the two triangles along the horizontal, since the perceptive contrast relies upon a separation of the objec~ on that direction.

The remaining problem is now to limit the context in which we consider these contrasts.

Indeed, all our examples so far were simple enough to imply that there was only one context in which to find the intended referent. On the contrary, i f we consider a more complex situation taken from a Wizard of Oz simulation in the domain of interior furnishing (Dauchy et alii, 1993; Mignot et alii 1993), we will see that our analysis should actually be drawn a step further.
