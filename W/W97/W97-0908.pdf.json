In each case, through a combination of adding and deleting a modest number of grammar rules, and modifying the conditions on many others, a broad-coverage target grammar emerged.","Tests indicate that this approach has been successful in achieving a high degree of coverage in a relatively short period of time."]},{"title":"1 Grammar Sharing","paragraphs":["A broad-coverage multilingual NLP system such as the one currently being developed at Microsoft Research faces the challenge of parallel grammar development in multiple languages (currently English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). This development is by nature a very complex and time-consuming task. In addition, the design of the overall NLP system has to be well suited to be readily portable to languages other than the one the development started with (English in our case). For these reasons, few groups have succeeded at the challenge of multilingual NLP. I","This work has benefited from comments and suggestions from other members of the Natural Language Processing group at Microsoft Research. Particular thanks go to Simon Corston. Bill Dolan, Ken Felder, Karen Jensen, Martine Penenaro, Hisami Suzuki, and Lucy Vanderwende.","One approach to multilingual development is to rely on theoretical concepts such as Universal Grammar. The goal is to create a grammar that can easily be parameterized to handle many languages. Wu (1994) describes an effort aimed at accounting for word order variation, but his focus is on the demonstration of a theoretical concept. Kameyama (1988) describes a prototype shared grammar for the syntax of simple nominal expressions for five languages, but the focus of the effort is only on the noun phrase, which makes the approach not applicable to a large-scale effort. Principle-based parsers are also designed with universal grammar in mind (Lin 1994), but have yet to demonstrate large-scale coverage in several languages. Other efforts have been presented in the literature, with a focus on generation (Bateman et al. 1991.) An effort to port a grammar of English to French and Spanish is also underway at SRI (Rayner et al. 1996.)","The approach taken in the MSNLP project focused from the beginning on possibilities for grammar sharing between languages to facilitate grammar development and reduce the development time. We want to stress that our use of the term \"grammar sharing\" is not to be confused with \"code sharing.\" Grammar sharing, in our use of the term, simply means that the existing grammar for one language can be used totally or in part to serve as the development basis for a second language.","In this paper we Want to demonstrate that the jumpstart through grammar sharing considerably accelerated grammar development in French, Spanish, and German. We will present test and progress data from all languages to support our claim."]},{"title":"2 The Microsoft NLP System","paragraphs":["The English grammar that we used as our starting point, as well as the target-language grammars that were spawned from it, are sketch grammars.

Grammar work in each language proceeds according to the same rationale: the grammarian processes sentences from diverse text sources and examines the resulting parses. He/she then determines whether the resulting parse is a desirable one. If this is the case, the sentence with the correct parse is added to a regression file. If the parse is incorrect, conditions on grammar rules are modified or added to accommodate the sentence in question and similar constructions. Regression tests are run frequently to ensure that new changes do not affect the performance of the system in any negative way. A debugging tool is available for the linguist to immediately view differences that arise in the processing of the regression file compared to an earlier run. Another important tool enables the grammarian to identify conditions in grammar rules that have been tried during a particular parse, and distinguish those that succeeded from those that failed."]},{"title":"3.1 French","paragraphs":["Development of the French grammar started in 1995. French grammar work has covered most major constructs including: Â• clitic pronouns Â• attachment of adjectival modifiers to the right","of the nominal head in NPs Â• the more liberal use of infinitival complements","in French than in English Â• questions and other subject inversion","constructions Â• compound noun constructions Â• floating quantifiers and negatives","The French dictionary currently consists of 68,000 words.

The morphology, which includes word-breaking, is nearly complete, with 97% word recognition on a 400,000 word corpus.","Because Spanish and German share the fundamental property of freer constituent order than 51 English, German grammar has benefited from some of the solutions for this challenge already worked out for Spanish. Grammar sharing between Spanish and German focused mainly on adoption of Spanish code from the binary rules that combine verbs and preceding/following noun phrases."]},{"title":"3.4 Changes from the English Grammar to the Target Grammars","paragraphs":["In spite of the numerous areas of divergence between the target grammars and English, we found that the fundamental organization of the grammar changed as little as 10-19% (see specifics in Table 1). The bulk of the required modifications occurred in the conditions on the rules. Since these conditions are complex, it is difficult to illustrate them fully here. To give one simpl e example, in French and Spanish, we found it necessary to exclude all NPs that consisted of clitic pronouns from rules that attach modifiers on NPs.","Few rules had to be added or completely removed from the grammar. For example, bootstrapping the Spanish grammar from an English grammar consisting of 129 rules required that only 13 of the original English rules (10.1%) be deleted, while 10 new rules (7.8%) were introduced. Language % Deleted % Added Spanish 10.1 7.8 German 10.7 8.6 French 7.8 2.3","Table 1: percentages of deleted/added rules with","respect to the English source grammar.","The new rules were added to accommodate constructions in the target language that are (virtually) non-existent in English. Spanish, for example, added rules to handle nominalized prepositional phrases like el de Juan and nominal uses of infinitives: al verlo. French needed rules to handle present participles introduced by en: en partant, and for sentential constructions like Heureusement qu'il est venu! German added rules for constructions such as postposed genitive NPs (das Buch Peters) and participial VPs premodifying NPs: die dem Mann gegebenen Biicher."]},{"title":"4 Testing and Progress Measurement","paragraphs":["Testing NLP systems is known to be a difficult task, and one that is hard to standardize across systems with different aims and different grammatical foundations (see e.g. the discussion in Balkan et al. n.d.). One relatively simple measurement that we found particularly useful for the beginning stages of grammar development is the percentage of non-FITI'ED parses on a corpus containing sentences from different types of text (news, literature, technical writing etc.).","In what follows, this corpus for each language will be referred to as a benchmark corpus and coverage refers to the percentage of non-FITTED parses for the benchmark corpus. Sentence length refers to the number of words in the sentence. In testing, the linguist does not examine the output parses obtained from the benchmark corpus, in order to avoid targeting modifications of the grammar towards the particular problems with FITTED parses in the benchmark file. This \"blind\" test yields a rough measure of the real coverage of the grammar. It should be noted that although some non-FITTED parses may not constitute the desired parse, many FITTED parses yield a largely usable parse which has only failed at the sentence level) But more important at this point is the fact that our measurement against a benchmark allows us to reliably track progress over time.","Even though not all of the successfully parsed sentences are guaranteed to have received a desired parse, a stable increase in the percentage of parsed sentences during language-specific grammar work has proven to be a reliable measurement of progress. This is particularly true given that grammar work (as described above) proceeds on the basis of example sentences that come to a large extent from real-life text.","A factor that influences the coverage considerably is sentence length. In order to assess the relationship between sentence length and the percentage of parsed sentences in a corpus, we use a tool that extracts information from a parsed corpus on the ratio of successfully parsed sentences to FITI'ED parses depending on sentence length. 3 Additional testing of considerable magnitude would be required to evaluate \"perfect con~ctness\". This would take us away from development, and provide slower feedback of progress. 52"]},{"title":"5 Results 5.1 French","paragraphs":["The corpus gathered for French is 500 sentences long, and 16.9 words average in length.
