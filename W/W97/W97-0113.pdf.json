A primary purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that the reliability of human supplied annotations on corpora has crucial effects on how well an automatic abstracting system performs. The corpus is developed through human judgements on possible s~,mmary sentences in a text. The reliability of human judgements is evaluated by the kappa statistic, a reliability metric standardly used in behavioral sciences. The C4.5 decision tree method (Quinlan, 1993) is used to build a extraction model. We demonstrate that there is a positive correlation of data reliability with a performance of automatic abstracting, and show results indicating that the reliability of human provided data is crucial for improving the performance of automatic abstracting. I. INTRODUCTION The traditional approach to automatic abstracting aims at providing a reader with fast access to documents by facilitating a judgement on their relevance to his or her information needs. Another possible use of automatic abstracting can be found in wor~ such as Bateman and Teich (1995) and Alexa et al. (1996), where computer-generated abstracts are used for the editing purposes.","In this paper, we discuss an approach to automatic abstracting where an abstract is created by extracting sentences from a text that are indicative of its content. In particular, the paper focuses on creating abstracts of Japanese newspaper texts. An approach to abstracting by extraction typically makes use of a text corpus with labelled extracts, indicating which sentence is a summary extract. However, as far as we know, no question has ever been raised on the empirical validity of the extracts used. Usually, extracts are manually supplied by 113 Table 1: Statistics on Corpus Text Type Length in char. # Par. # Articles Column about 640 4-5 352 Editorial 900-1100 6-9 131 News Report 800-1000 6-9 147 the author himself (Watanabe, 1996) or by someone else (McKeown and Radev, 1995) (as in the TIPSTER Ziff-Davis corpus). Or one takes a roundabout way to identify extracts in a text through a human-supplied abstract (Kupiec et al.: 1995). In the paper, we will propose Â• a method for identifying summary extracts in a way that allows objective justification. We will do this by examining how humans perform on summary extraction and evaluating the reliability of their performance, using the kappa statistic, a metric standardly used in the behavioral sciences (Jean Carletta, 1996; Sidney Siegel and N. John Castellan Jr., 1988). Based on summary extracts supplied by hum~us, we construct a collection of texts annotated with information on sentence importance. They will be used as training and test data for a decision tree approach to abstracting, which we adopt in the paper (Qulnlan, 1993). In a decision tree approach, the task of extracting summary sentences is treated as a two-way classification task, where a sentence is assigned to either \"yes\" or \"no\" category, depending on its likelihood of being a summary sentence. The merit of a decision tree method is that it provides a generic framework in which to combine knowledge from multiple sources, a property necessary for automatic abstracting where information from a single source alone often fails to determine which sentence to extract. 2. METHODOLOGY 2.1. Collecting Data on S!lrnmary Extraction by Humans","We conducted experiments with humans to collect data on how they perform on the sentence extraction task. We asked 112 naive subjects (students at graduate and undergraduate level) to extract 10 % of sentences in a text which they consider most important in making its summary. The number of extractions varied from two to four, depending on the length of a text. The age of subjects varied from 18 to 45. The experiments used 75 texts from three different text categories (25 for each category); COLUMN, EDITORIAL and NEWS REPORT. The texts were of about the same size in terms of character counts and the number of paragraphs, and were selected randomly from axticles that appeared in a Japanese economics daily in 1995 (Nihon-Keizai-Shimbun-Sha, 1995). Table I provides some statistics on the corpus from which extraction tests are constructed. A single test material consists of three extraction problems, each with a text from a different category. Though 85 of 112 subjects were assigned to one test, due to the lack of enough subjects, we had to ask the remaining 27 subjects to work on 114 q five tests. On the average, each test had about 7 subjects assigned to it. 2.2. Measurement of B.eliability The Kappa Statistic Following Jean Carletta (1996), we use the kappa statistic (Sidney Siegel and N. John Castellan Jr., 1988) to measure degree of agreement among subjects. The reason for choosing the kappa over other measures of agreement (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) derives from our interest in discovering a relationship between the reliability or quality of data (as quantified by some metric) and the performance of automatic abstracting. As aptly pointed out in Jean Carletta (1996), agreement measures proposed so far in the computational linguistics literature has failed to ask an important question of whether results obtained using agreement data are in any way different from random data. It has been left unclear just how high level of agreement among subjects needs to be achieved before reliably using data. It could be the case that data with high agreement may still be too noisy to use for a task for which they were collected.","We assume that the kappa coefficient gives a suitable way of measuring the reliability of data, where we take reliability to mean reproducibility of data, or the degree to which data are reproduced under different circumstances, with different coders (Krippendorff, 1980). The kappa coefficient (K) of agreement measures the ratio of observed agreements to possible agreements among a set of raters on category judgements, correcting for chance agreement:","K = P(A) - P(E) 1 - P(E)"]},{"title":"(I)","paragraphs":["where P(A) is the propo~ion of the times that raters agree and P(E) is the proportion of the times that we would expect them to agree by chance. K = 1 if there is complete agreement among the raters. K = 0 if there is no agreement other than that which is expected by chance. Consider a set of k raters and a group of N objects, each of which is to be assigned to one of m categories. Each of the raters assigns each object to one category. We represent the assignments data as an N x m matrix (Table 2), where the value (n~j) at each cellij (0 < i _< N, 0 < j < m) denotes the number of raters assigning the ith object to the jth category. Let Cj be the total number of times that objects are assigned to the jth category,","N i.e., Cj = ~ n~j. Si measures the proportion of pairwise agreements among the raters on","i=1 category assignments for a particular object i.

Note that 0 < Si ~ 1. Si = 1 when there is total agreement among the raters for a given category j on the ith row. Suppose that we asked 2m raters to assign two objects a and b to one of m categories and found results as in Table 3. For a, there is a complete agreement on the object's category, while for b, decisions are spread evenly over m categories. Since Sa = 1 and Sb = 1/(2m -- 1) (m > 1), we have Sa > Sb.","The proportion P(A) of the times that the raters agree is given as the average of Si across all objects (Def. 3).","P(A) = N m (3) i=1 The expected probability that a category is chosen at random is estimated as Pi = Ci/(N\" k). Then, the probability that any two raters agree on the jth category by chance would be p~. P(E) is defined as the sum of chance agreement for each category (Def 4), representing the overall rate of agreement by chance.","P(E) = (4) i=l The values of P(A) and P(E) are then combined to give the kappa coefficient K. Evaluation Judgements produced by subjects on a summary extraction task can be cast into an assignments matrix in a number of different ways. (Note that a single extraction 116 Table 4: A matrix representation of a hypothetical example","OBJECTSlJS1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 S? $8 $9 $10 [ #subjects 1 3 - - 3 1 1 1 9 2 - 2 1 2 - 1 2 1 9 3 - - 1 - 2 2 1 3 9 c II 2 2 2 3 4 1 5 2 3 II ii ii Table 5: Kappa coefficients for judgements on sentence importance J Text Type K # Texts., # Raters COLUMN 0.122 25 183 EDITORIAL 0.156 25 184 NEWS REPORT 0.255 25 183 task consists of extracting a specified number of sentences from one text.) We adopt here a representation scheme where we take N to be the number of choices made by a subject for a text and m to be the number of sentences in that text. 1 (Note that since we asked a subject to choose 10% of sentences in the text, the number of extractions made for each text depends entirely on the text's length, but the number of extractions from a given text should be the same across subjects.) Imagine for instance that nine subjects are asked to extract three most important sentences from a text with ten sentences. Under the scheme here, the resulting data could be represented as a matrix of height N = 3 and width rn = 10 with k = 9 like one in Table 4, where the first object is thought of as an earliest occurring sentence a subject considers most important, the second object as a second earliest occurring sentence a subject considers most important, and the third object as a third earliest sentence a subject considers most important. It is important to notice that a matrix is constructed for each extraction task and the agreement coefficient K is determined for each task, not for each sentence in the text. Table 5 lists the K values for subjects' judgements on sentence importance, averaged over texts. The number of subjects assigned to one extraction task varied from 4 to 9. 96% of the time, we had over 6 subjects working on a same task. The average number of subjects per text was 7.33. 2 We find in Table 5, however, that there is only marginal agreement among subjects.","IAnother possibility is to represent the data as an JV x m matrix of height N=the number of sentences in the text and width m = 2 (yes/no), representing a binary judgement about whether a given sentence is relevant for summarizing.","Sin Table 5, there are more raters than subjects. This happens because subjects are multiply assigned to extraction tasks. 117 Table 6: A reliability scale based on K (cited in Carletta et al.

However it is not immediately clear how an abstracting program trained on such 'untrustworthy' data would perform. How does the notion of level of agreement or data reliability in a behavioral scientist's sense relate to the performance of automatic abstracting ? This is a question we are going to address in the following sections.

Table 7 lists average agreement rates for data with thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.8. The row represents K thresholds, and the column represents text types. Figures in parentheses axe the number of texts with a given threshold.","3For the reasons mentioned earlier, we dismiss a negative agreement among the majority altogether, which is in contrast with Passonneau and Litman (1993)'s approach where agreement among the majority, either positive or negative, counts as a majority opinion.","4The removal of decisions against the majority consists of the following steps. (a) Let a desirable level of agreement be t (0 < ~ < 1). For each text, set the size of the majority to 1. (b) Find K. If K > ~, stop. (c) Otherwise increase the s'me by one and remove decisions against the majority so defined. Go back to (b). Note that there will be no removaJ of disagreeing decisions if the text has the kappa coefficient greater than or equal to t at the start. 118 Table 7: Thresholding by the kappa coefficient","K 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8","COLUMN 0.25(23) 0.37(21) 0.50(21) 0.55(20) 0.59(18) 0.73(10) 0.75(7) 1.00(1)","EDITORIAL 0.20(24) 0.35(22) 0.49(20) 0.55(20)0.62(18) 0.68(12) 0.87(5) 0.95(3)","NEWS REPORT 0.26(25) 0.38(25) 0.52(24) 0.62(23) 0.65(23) 0.76(13) 0.82(9) 1.00(5) 2.3.

We constructed 15 sets of coded texts from the corpus by varying the threshold value of agreement from 0.1 to 0.8. 2.4. Attributes","Attributes provide ways in which to code a sentence. The trouble is, there are many possible ways of choosing among potential attributes and one has to go through some trial and error experimentation to find a set of attributes that work best for his or her task. The selection of attributes is essentially heuristic and empirical. After some ex~mlnation, we have settled on the following set of attributes, some of which are variations of those typically found in the summarization literature (Kupiec et al., 1995; Paice and Jones, 1993; Edmundson, 1969; Zechner, 1996).","Text Type: This attribute is categorical and identifies the type of a text to which a given sentence belongs.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION","We discarded data sets with K > 0.5 because they lacked a su~cient number of sentences for evaluation: the column-type data has only 19 sentences at 0.8 (Cf. Table 7). This had left us with nine sets of data with associated threshold values, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2~ 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, and 0.5. 6 Texts contained in the evaluation data ranged in length from 314 to 535 sentences. A part of a generated decision tree is given in Figure 1. See the caption for explanations.","The procedure for evaluation consists in the following steps: (1) choose at random 200 cases of category \"no\" and 40 of category \"yes\" from each of the data sets to form evaluation data; (2) divide the data so chosen into a training set and a test set; (3) build a decision tree from the training set, rnnning C4.5 with the default options; and (4) evaluate its performance on the test data. Since the accuracy of evaluation can vary wildly depending on ways in which the data is divided into training and test sets, the re-sampling method of cross-validation is used here, which gives the average over possible partitions of the data into training and test sets. In particll]~r, we use a 10-fold cross-validation method where the data are divided into 10 blocks of cases, of which 9 blocks are used for the training and the remaining one for the","eData with the threshold --- 0.1, for instance, consists of coded representations of texts whose agreement rate is above or is equal to 0.1."]},{"title":"121 Figure 1: A partial decision tree: figures in parentheses denote the number of hits (left) and misses (right) a particular path gives.

CONCLUSION We have seen how human reliability can affect the performance of automatic abstracting. Reliability refers to reproducibility or inter-coder consistency of data, which is measured by the kappa statistic, a metric standardly used in the behavioral sciences. It was found that reliability enhances the strength of \"good\" attributes for a sentence, leading to an improved performance of abstracting models. But we did not discuss an important question of whether the kappa statistic serves as a general tool for distinguishing \"good\" from \"bad\" data for training a learning algorithm.","We have also found that a set of attributes vary in effectiveness from one text type to another, though texts under consideration are all ~om the same domain. But at the moment, it is not clear to us what is a good attribute for representing texts like columns, for which the abstracting model was found not effective. It could be the case that no good attribute exists for columns. In fact humans are not doing well on them either."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Many thanks go to the following people, who helped us organize and conduct the testing on summary extraction: Hideaki Takahashi, Sachiko Yoshida, Jun Haga, Takehito Utsuro, and Takashi Miyata.
