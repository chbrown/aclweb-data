Nakano NTT Information and","Communication Systems Labs.","Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239, JAPAN","yukikoÂ©nttnly, isl. ntt. co. jp Abstract Referring actions in multimodal situations can be thought of as linguistic expressions well coordinated with several physical actions. In this paper, what patterns of linguistic expressions are commonly used and how physical actions are temporally coordinated to them are reported based on corpus examinations. In particular, by categorizing objects according to two features, visibility and membership, the schematic patterns of referring expressions are derived. The difference between the occurrence frequencies of those patterns in a multimodal situation and a spoken-mode situation explains the findings of our previous research. Implementation based on these results is on going. 1 Introduction A lot of active studies have been conducted on the temporal coordination of natural language and visual information. The visual information considered includes pointing gestures (Andrd & Rist, 1996), facial expressions and iconic gestures (Cassell et al., 1994), and graphical effects such as highlighting and blinking (Dalal et al., 1996; Feiner et ah, 1993). Among those we have been focusing on generating effective explanations by using natural language temporally coordinated with pictures and gestures. The experimental system we implemented is for explaining the installation and operation of a telephone with an answering machine feature, and simulates instruction dialogues performed by an expert in a face-to-face situation with a telephone in front of her (Kato et al., 1996). The system explains by using synthesized speech coordinated with pointing gestures from a caricatured agent and simulated operations implemented by the switching of figures. One of the important issues for enhancing this type of system is to shed light on what makes referring actions fluent in multimodal situations and to build a mechanism to generate such fluent actions.","We also empirically investigated how communicative modes influence the content and style of referring actions made in dialogues (Kato & Nakano, 1995). Experiments were conducted to obtain a corpus consisting of human-to-human instruction dialogues on telephone installation in two settings. One is a spoken-mode dialogue situation (SMD hereafter), in which explanations are given using just voice. The other is a multimodal dialogue situation (MMD hereafter), in which both voice and visual information, mainly the current state and outlook of the expert's telephone and her pointing gestures to it, can be communicated. Detailed analysis of the referring actions observed in that corpus revealed the following two properties.","PI: The availability of pointing, communication through the visual channel reduces the amount of information conveyed through the speech or linguistic channel. In initial identification, the usage of linguistic expressions on shape/size, characters/marks, and related objects decreases in MMD, while the usage of position information does not decrease.","P2: In SMD, referring actions tend to be realized to an explicit goal and divided into a series of fine-grained steps. The participants try to achieve them step by step with many confirmations.","Although our findings were very suggestive for an-alyzing the properties of referring actions in multimodal situations, they were still descriptive and not sufficient to allow their use in designing referring action generation mechanisms. Then, as the next step, we have been examining that corpus closer and trying to derive some schemata of referring actions, which would be useful for implementation of multimodal dialogue systems. This paper reports the results of these activities.","Two short comments must be made to make our research standpoint clearer. First, our purpose is to generate referring actions that model human referring actions in mundane situations. Theoretically speaking, as Appelt pointed out, it is enough for referring to provide sufficient description to distin-"]},{"title":"Towards Generation of Fluent Referring Action in Multimodal Situations 21","paragraphs":["guish one object from the other candidates (Appelt, 1985). For example, a pointing action to the object must be enough, or description of the object's position, such as \"the upper left button of the dial buttons\" also must be considered sufficient. However, we often observe referring actions that consist of a linguistic expression, \"a small button with the mark of a handset above and to the left of the dial buttons\", accompanied with a pointing gesture. Such a referring action is familiar to us even though it is redundant from a theoretical viewpoint. Such familiar actions that the recipient does not perceive as awkward is called fluent in this paper. Our objective is to generate such fluent referring actions, and is rather different from those of (Appelt, 1985) and (Dale & Haddock, 1991).","Second, in our research, a referring action is considered as the entire sequence of actions needed for allowing the addressee to identify the intended object and incorporating its achievement into part of the participants' shared knowledge. In order to refer to an object in a box, an imperative sentence such as \"Open the box, and look inside\" may be used. Such a request shifts the addressee's attention, and to see it as a part of the referring action may be problematic. It is, however, reasonable to think that both the request for looking into the box and the assertion of the fact that an object is in the box come from different plans for achieving the same goal, identifying the object. As Cohen claimed that it is useful to understand referring expressions from the viewpoint of speech act planning (Cohen, 1984), it is not so ridiculous to go one step further and to consider the entire sequence of actions, including attention shifts, as an instance of a plan for object referring. Moreover, this approach better suits implementing a referring action generation mechanism as a planner.","The next section describes what kinds of linguistic expression are used for referring actions in MMD and compares them with those in SMD. In particular, by categorizing objects according to two features: visibility and membership, schemata for object referring expressions of each category are derived. In the third section, how several kinds of actions such as pointing gestures are accompanied by such expressions is reported. In the fourth section, implementation of referring action generation is discussed based on our findings described thus far. Finally, in the last section, our findings are summarized and future work is discussed."]},{"title":"2 Linguistic expression in referring actions","paragraphs":["Referring actions in multimodal situations can be thought of as linguistic expressions well coordinated with several physical actions.

Although the objects such as buttons can be identified by using several features such as position, color, shape, and size, the two features described below proved to be dominant in the referring expressions used.","Visibility: Some objects are located on the side or back of the telephone, and can not be seen unless the body is turned over or looked into. Some objects lie underneath the cover, and opening that cover is needed in order to see them. Such objects are categorized into invisible ones and distinguished from visible ones, which are located on the top 1.","Membership: Aligned buttons of the same shape and color are usually recognized as a group. Members of such a group are distinguished from isolated ones 2.","In Fig. 1, socket 1 on the side is invisible and isolated, button 1 on the left of the top surface is visible and isolated, button 2 on the lower right of the top surface is a visible group member, and button 3 on the upper right is an invisible group member as it is underneath a cassette cover usually closed.","According to this categorization, we determined which patterns of referring expressions were frequently observed for each type of object. The patterns thus extracted can be expected to yield","tAs you have already realized, this feature is not in-trinsic to the object, but depends on the state of the telephone when the object is referred to. Buttons underneath the cover are visible when the cover is open.","2The recognition of a group may differ among people. In daily life, however, we believe an effective level of consensus can be attained."]},{"title":"22 T. Kato and Y.L Nakano","paragraphs":["schemata for referring expression generation. Three explanations of five experts in two situations, MMD and SMD, i.e. fifteen explanations in each situation, were analyzed. The apprentices differed with each explanation. Every referring expression analyzed involved initial identification, which is used to make the first effective reference to an object, and to in-troduce it into the explanation. All objects were referred to in the context in which the expert made the apprentice identify it and then requested that some action be performed on it. All explanations were done in Japanese 3. 2.2 Schemata for referring to visible","isolated objects Referring actions to visible isolated objects are rather simple and were basic for all cases. Two major patterns were observed and can be treated as the schemata. Table 1 shows these two schemata 4, called RS1 and RS2 hereafter. RS1 contains two sentences. The first asserts the existence of the object at a described position. The second is an imperative sentence for requesting that an action be performed on the object identified. In the first sentence, a postpositional phrase describing the object position precedes the object description. The object description is a noun phrase that has modifiers describing features of the object such as its color or size followed by a head common noun describing the object category. That is, its structure is","[object description np]","[feature description pp/comp] *","[object class name n]","In RS2, the imperative sentence requesting an action contains a description referring to the object. This description has the same structure as RS1 shown above. In most cases, the first feature description is a description of the object position. In both schemata, object position is conveyed first, other features second, and the requested action follows. This order of information flow seems natural for identifying the object and then acting on it. Examples of referring expressions 5 that fit these schemata are","3 Japanese is a head-final language. Complements and postpositional phrases on the left modify nouns or noun phrases on the right, and construct noun phrases. That is, a simphfied version of Japanese grammar contains pp --~ np p, np ~ pp rip, np --~ comp rip, and np ~ n. Sentences are constructed by a rule, s ~ pp* v. The order of pps is almost free syntactically, being determined by pragmatic constraints. Older information precedes newer (Kuno, 1978).","4Schemata are represented as sequences of terminal symbols, non terminal symbols each of those has a form of [semantic content syntactic category], and schema ID. A slash appearing in a syntactic category means options rather than a slash feature.","tAll examples are basically extracted from the corpus examined. Those, however, were slightly modified by","(1) daiarubotan no hidariue ni juwaki no dial-buttons upper-left LOC handset maaku ga tsuita chiisai botan mark SUBJ being-placed-on small button ga arimasu, sore wo oshi tekudasai.

Sometimes it is implicitly confirmed by as-serting the existence of the object as the speaker's belief. In RS2, confirmation can be made by putting a phrase for confirmation after the noun phrase describing the object or by putting there a pause and a demonstrative pronoun appositively.","Another pattern was observed in which RS1 was preceded by an utterance referring to a landmark used in the position description.

This suggests that referring expressions should be affected by the history of the group as well as of the object itself. just skeletons, and referring expressions with more diverse forms appear in the collected corpus. The most important origin of this diversity is that explanation dialogue is a cooperative process (Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1990). First, several stages of a referring action can trigger confirmation. Those confirmations are realized by using various linguistic devices such as interrogative sentences, tag questions, and specific intonations. Second, related to incremental elaboration, appositive and supplemental expressions are observed. For example,","(13) rusu botan arimasu ne, gamen no OUT button exist CONFIRM display shita, \"rusu\" to kakareta shiroi botan. under \"OUT\" with being-labeled white button 'There is an OUT button, under the display, a white button labeled \"OUT.\"'","These inherent dialogue features complicate referring expressions. Moreover, it is difficult to derive patterns from exchanges in which the apprentice plays a more active role such as talking about or checking her idea on the procedure in advance.","The second origin of diversity relates to the fact that experts sometimes try to achieve multiple goals at the same time. Labeling an object with a proper name is sometimes achieved simultaneously with identifying it. This phenomena, however, could be schematized to some extent. Two patterns are observed.

Their synchronization is more precise than the case of exhibit actions.

In this example, it is not clear whether the last action is a pointing gesture or a simulated operation. 4 Discussion on implementation We have began to implement a referring action generation mechanism using the schemata derived and coordination patterns described so far. The experimental system we are now developing shows a GIF picture of the telephone, and draws a caricatured agent over it. The pointing gestures are realized by redrawing the agent. As every picture is annotated by the object positions it contains, generating a pointing gesture and interpreting user's one are possible and easy. Other actions such as turning the body and opening the cassette cover are realized by playing a corresponding digital movie at exactly the same place as the GIF picture displayed s. The first frame of the digital move is the same as the GIF picture shown at that point of the time, and while the movie is being played, the picture in the background is switched to the one equaling the last frame of the movie. Fig. 4 depicts this mechanism. Those actions need considerable time as do human experts. This is in contrast to our previous system which implemented such actions by switching pictures so the time taken was negligible.","The framework adopted for coordination between utterances and actions is synchronization by reference points (Blakowski, 1992). The beginning and end points of intonational phrases must be eligible as reference points. It's still under consideration if just waiting, for which pauses are put after the action finished earlier, is enough or more sophisticated operations such as acceleration and deceleration i.e. changing utterance speed, are needed. The need for dynamic planning such as used in PPP (Andre & Rist, 1996) should be examined. 5 Summary and future work What patterns of linguistic expressions are commonly used and how physical actions are temporally coordinated to them were reported based on cor-","8Tcl/tk is used for showing the GIF pictures and drawing the agent as well as other basic input/output functions; xanim is used for playing the digital movies."]},{"title":"28 T.

In particular, by categorizing objects according to two features, visibility and membership, the schemata of referring expressions could be derived. This categorization is still not sufficient for uniquely determining each reference expression, and some other features must impact the expressions used. This is, however, a good first step, as the two most dominant features were obtained. Moreover, the difference between the occurrence frequencies of those schemata in MMD and SMD explains the findings of our previous research. Implementation based on these results is on going.","There is a lot of future work beyond the implementation issues. First, the reported coordination patterns between linguistic expressions and actions must be verified in a quantitative manner. An objective criterion for annotating visual information is hard to establish. Overcoming this problem is important and unavoidable. Next, our research must be generalized in two perspectives: the results must be confirmed in many materials other than our telephone; the degree of dependency on the language used must be examined.","One of major problems stemming from our approach is that the importance of criteria is not clear. Although the criteria can be derived by observing and modeling the explanations made by experts, there may be fluent explanation techniques not yet observed. Deviations from the criteria do not cause a big problem, and the recipients do not perceive them to be awkward. These problems can be examined when the system currently implemented is made to generate several types of referring actions experimentally.","Appelt, D.E., \"Planning English Referring Expressions\", Artificial Intelligence 26, 1985, pp. 1 - 33","Blakowski, G., Hiiel, J., Langrehr, U. and Miilh~er, J., \"Tool Support for the Synchronization and Presentation of Distributed Multimedia\", Computer Communication, Vol. 15, No. 10, 1992, pp. 611 - 618","Cassell, J., Pelachaud, C., Badler, N. and et al., \"Animated Conversation: Rule-based Generation of Facial Expression, Gesture & Spoken Intona-tion for Multiple Conversational Agents\", SIG-GRAPH 94, pp. 413 - 420, 1994","Cohen, P.R., \"The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication\", Computational Linguistics, Vol. 10, No. 2, 1984, pp. 97 - 146","Clark, H.H. and Wilkes-Gibbs, D. \"Referring as a Collaborative Process\", \"Intentions in Communication\" eds.
