My work concerned the written language, but as spelling of Czech is based on phonological principles, moSt statements will be true about phonology, too,","My task was to encode an existing Czech morphological dictionary (Haji~, 1994) as a finite state transducer. The existing lexicon was originally designed :for simple C programs that only attach \"endings\" to the \"stems\". The quota-tion marks in the previous sentence mean that the terms are not used in the linguistic mean-ing but rather, technically: Stem means any part of a word: that is not changed in declension/conjugation. Ending means the real ending and possibly also another part of the word that is changed. Wh:en I started the work on convert-ing this lexicon to a two-level morphology system, the first idea was that it should be linguistically more elegant and accurate. This required me to redesign the set of patterns and their corresponding endings. From the original number of 219 paradigms I got 159 that use 116 sets of endings. Under the term paradigm I mean the set of endings that belong to one lemma (e.g. noun endings for all seven cases in both numbers) and possible derivations with their corresponding endings (e.g. possessive adjectives derived from nouns in all possible forms). That is why the number of paradigms is higher then the number of endings.","In this approach, it is necessary to deal with the phonological changes that occur at boundaries between the stem and the suffix/ending or between the suffix and the ending. There are also changes inside the stem (e.g. p~'tel 'friend' x p~dteld 'friends', or hndt 'to chase' x 5enu 'I chase'), but I will not deal with them, as they are rather rare and irregular. They are treated in the lexicon as exceptions. I also will not deal with all the changes that may occur in a verb stem--this would require reconstructing the forms of the verbs back in the 14th century, which is outside the scope:of my work. Instead, I work with several stems of these irregular verbs. For example the verb hndt ('to chase') has three different stems, hnd- for infinitive, 5en- for the present tense, imperative and present participles, and hna- for the past participles. The verb vdst ('to lead') has two stems, vds- for the infinitive and ved- for all finite forms and participles. The verb tit ('to cut') has the stem tn- in the present tense, and the stem ra-in the past tense; the participles can be formed both from the present and the past stem. For practical reasons we work either with one verb stem (for regular verbs) or with six stems (for irregular verbs). These six stems are stems for"]},{"title":"4-1","paragraphs":["infinitive, present indicative, imperative, past participle, transgressive and passive participle. In fact, there is no verb in Czech with six different stems, but this division is made because of various combinations of endings with the stems.","2 Types of phonological alternations in Czech We will deal with three types of phonological alternations: palatalization, assimilation and epenthesis. Palatalization occurs mainly in declension and partly also in conjugation. Assimilation occurs mainly in conjugation. Epenthesis occurs both in declension and in conjugation. 2.1 Epenthesis An epenthetic e occurs in a group of consonants before a O-ending. The final group of consonants can consist of a suffix (e.g. -k or -b) and a part of the stem; in this case the epenthesis is obligatory (e.g. kousek x kousku 'piece', malba x maleb 'painting'). In cases when the group is morphologically unseparable, the application of epenthesis depends on whether the group of consonants is phonetically admissable at word end. In loan words, the epenthetic e may occur if the final group of consonants reminds a Czech suffix (e.g. korek x korku 'cork', but alba x alb 'alb'). In declension, two situations can occur:","Â• The base form contains an epenthetic e; the rule has to remove it, if the form has a non-O ending, e.g. chlapec 'boy', chlapci dative/locative sg or nominative pl.","Â• The base form has a non-O ending; the rule has to insert an epenthetic e, if the ending is O, e.g. chodba 'corridor', chodeb genitive pl.","In conjugation, an epenthetic e occurs in the past participle, masculine sg of the verb jit 'to go' (and its prefixed derivations): gel 'he-gone', gla 'she-gone', glo 'it-gone'. The rule has to insert an epenthetic e if the form has a O-ending. 2.2 Palatalization and assimilation Palatalization or assimilation at the morpheme boundaries occurs when an ending/suffix starts with a soft vowel. The alternations are different for different types of consonants. The types of consonants and vowels are as follows: Â• hard consonants--d, (g,)h, ch, k, n, r, t Â• soft consonants--c, d, d, j, ~, Ã·, g, t, 2 Â• neutral consonants--b, l, m; p, s, v, z","Â• hard vowels--a, d, e, d, o, 6, u, ~, y, ~] and the diphthong ou Â• soft vowels--d, i, (","The vowel d cannot occur in the ending/suffix so it will not be interesting for us. I also will not discuss what happens with 'foreign' consonants /, q, w and x--they would be treated as v, k, v and s, respectively. The only borrowing from foreign languages that I included to the above lists is g: This sound existed in Old Slavonic but in Czech it changed into h. However, when later new words with g were adopted from other languages, this sound behaved phonologically as h (e.g. hloh, hlozich--from Common Slavonic glog 'hawthorn', and katalog, kataloz(ch 'catalog').","The phonological alternations are reflected in writing, with one exception--if the consonants d, n and t are followed by a soft vowel, they are palatalized, but the spelling is not changed: spelling: d~, di phonology: /de/,/di/"]},{"title":"ne, ni I el, la l","paragraphs":["t~, ti / [e/, / [i/","In other cases the spelling reflects the phonology. In the further text I will use { } for the morpho-phonological level, / / for the phonological level and no brackets for the orthographical level. In the cases where the orthography and phonology are the same I will only use the orthographical level. Let us look at the possible types of alternation of consonants:","Â• Soft consonant and ~-- The soft consonant is not changed, the soft ~ is changed to e. {d(d@} ---+ d(de 'pussycat' dative sg","Â• Soft or neutral consonant and i/(-- No alternations occur. { d(di} ~ didi 'pussycat' genitive sg","Â• Hard consonant and a soft vowel -- The alternations differ depending on when and how the soft vowel originated.

I concentrated on dealing with the alternations that occur in declension and regular conjugation, and the most productive derivations. The rest of alternations occurring in conjugation are treated by inserting several verb stems in the lexicon. The list of alternations and other changes covered by the rules: Â• epenthesis Â• palatalization in declension Â• palatalization in conjugation","Â• palatalization in derivation nouns from masculines of feminine","Â• palatalization in derivation of possessive adjectives Â• palatalization in derivation of adverbs","Â• palatalization in derivation of comparatives of adjectives and adverbs","Â• palatalization or assimilation in derivation of passive participles","Â• shortening of the vowel in suffixes -ik (in derivation of feminine noun from masculine) and-~v (in declension of possesive adjectives)","For the CZech lexicon I used the software r tools for two-level morphology developed at Xerox (Karttune.n and Beesley, 1992; Karttunen, 1993). The le:kical forms are created by attaching the proper ending/suffix to the base form in a separate:program. To help the two-level rules to find where they should operate, I also marked morpheme boundaries by special markers. These markers have two further functions:","Â• They bear the information about the length of ending i(or suffix and ending) of the base form, i.e. how many characters should be removed before attaching the ending.","Â• They bear the information about the kind of alternation.","Beside the markers for morpheme boundaries I also use markers for an epenthetic e. As I said before, e is inserted before the last consonat of a final consonant group, if the last consonant is a suffix, or if the consonant group is not phonetically admissable. However, as I do not generally deal with derivation nor with the phonetics, I am not able to recognize what is a suffix and what is phone~ically admissable. That is why I need these special markers.","Another auxiliary marker is used for mark-ing the suffix -~7~, that needs a special treatment in derivation of feminine nouns and their possesive adjectives. The long vowel/must be shortened in the derivation, and the final k must be palatalized even if the O-ending follows. I need a special marker, as -ik- allows two realizations for both the sohnds in same contexts: Two realizations of i d~edn~7~ 'clerk' ~ d~ednice 'she-clerk', but rybnzT~ 'pond' ~ rybnlce locative sg Two realizations of k dÃ·ednzT~ x dÃ·ednic (genitive pl of the derived feminine) i","In the previous section, I described all possible alternations concerning single consonants. When I work with the paradigms or with the derivations, it is necessary to specify the kind of the alternation for all consonants that can occur at the boundary. For this purpose I in-troduced four types of markers:","\"1P -- 1st palatalization for g, h and k, or the only possible (or no) palatalization for other consonants. I use this marker also for palatalization c --~ 5 in vocative sg of the paradigm chlapec. The final c is in fact a palatalized k, so there is even a linguistic motivation for this.","A2P -- 2nd palatalization for g, h and k, or the only possible (or no) palatalization for other consonants. Â -- Assimilation (or nothing). AN --- NO alternation.","These markers are followed by a number that denotes how many characters of the base form should be removed before attaching the ending/suffix. Thus there are markers ~ 1P0, 2̂P0, 1̂P1, etc. The markers starting with N̂ only denote the length of the ending of the base form--and instead of using N̂0 I attach the suffix/ending directly to the base form. For-tunately, nearly all paradigms and derivations cause at most one type of alternation, so it is possible to use one marker for the whole paradigm.","The markers for an epenthetic e are Êl (for e that should be deleted) and Ê2 (for e that should be inserted). The marker for the suffix -zTc in derivations is ̂IK.","Here are some examples of lexical items and the rules that transduce them to the surface form: (1) doktorka ̂1Plin2̂P0~ch The base form is doktorka 'she-doctor'. The marker ÎP1 denotes that the possible alternation at this morpheme boundary is (first) palatalization and that the length of the ending of the base form is 1 (it means that a must be removed from the word form and the possible alternation concerns k). The marker ~2P0 means that the derived possessive adjective has a O-ending and the possible alternation at this morpheme boundary is palatalization. If we rewrite this string to a sequence of morphemes we get the following string: doktork-in-~jch. The sound k in front of i is palatalized, so the correct final form is doktordin~eh, which is genitive plural of the possessive adjective derived from the word doktorka.","Let us look now at the two-level rules that transduce the lexical string to the surface string. We need four rules in this example: two for deleting the markers, one for deleting the ending -a, and one for palatalization. The rules for deleting auxiliary markers are very simple, as these markers should be deleted in any context. The rules can be included in the definition of the alphabet of symbols: Alphabet 7j IP0 : 0 7j 1P1:0 7.'2P0:0 7,'2PI:0 7j2P2:0 7,'2P3:0 7jA2:0 Z'NI:0 Z'N2:0 Z'N3:0 Z'N4:0 Y,'EI:0 Y.'E2:0 Y.'IK:0 This notation means that the auxiliary markers are always realized as zeros on the surface level.","The rule for deleting the ending -c looks as follows: \"Deletion of the ending -a-\" a:O <=> _ [ Y,'NI: I ~jiPI: I ~,'2Pl: ] ;","_ t: [ Z'N2: I Z'N4: ];","The first line of the rule describes the context of a one-letter nominal ending u, and the second line describes the context of an infinitive suffix with ending -at or -ovut.","The rule for palatalization k -+ d looks as follows: \"First palatalization k -> ~\" k:~ <=> _ (7,'IK:) [ a: I ~: ] 7.'iPi: i ;","NonCeS: (End) 7.'1PI: ~: ;","The first line describes two possible cases: either the derivation of a possesive adjective from a feminine noun (doktorku--~ doktordin), or the derivation of a possesive adjective from a feminine noun derived from a masculine that ends with -~7~ ( ~ednzT~ ~ ( dÃ·ednice -+) dÃ·ednidin).","The second context describes a comparative of an adjective, or a comparative of adverb derived from that adjective (hoÃ·k~] ~ hoÃ·dejM, ho~deji). The set NonCCS contains all character except c, d and s and it is defined in a speciM section. This context condition is introduced, because the groups of consonants ck, dk and sk have different 1st palatalization.","The label End denotes any character that can occur in an ending and that is removed from the base form. (2) korek'2P0Êlem The base form of this word form is korek 'cork'; the marker 2̂P0 means their the possible alternation is (second) palatalization and that the length of ending of the base form is 0. The marker Êl means that the base form contains an epenthetic e, and em is the ending of in-strumental singular. The correct final form is korkem. The rule for deleting an (epenthetic) e follows:","\"Deletion of e\"","e:0 <=> Cons c: 7,'N2:;","[ YjIPI~\" I 7j2P1: I Y,'NI: I 7jN2: ]; Dons Cons: ([Z'IPO: IZ'2PO:]) Z'Ei: Vowel: ;","t:0-[ Z*2P2: I Z'N2: ];","The first line describes the context for dele-tion of the suffix -ec in the derivation of the type v~dec 'scientist' --+ v~dkyn~ 'she-scientist'.","The second context is the context of the ending -e or the suffix -ce. This suffix must be removed in the derivation of the type soudce 'judge' ~ soudkyn~ 'she-judge'. :","The third context is the context of an epenthetic e that is present in the base form and must be removed from a form with a non-O ending. The sets Cons and Vowel contain all consonants and all vowels, respectively.","The fourth line describes the context for dele-tion of the infinitive ending -et.","The whole program contains 35 rules. Some of the rules concern rather morphology than phonology; namely the rules that remove endings or suffixes. One rule is purely technical; it is one of the two rules for the alternation ch ~ ~, as c and h must be treated separately"]},{"title":"4.6","paragraphs":["(though ch is considered one letter in Czech alphabet). Six rules are forced by the Czech spelling rules (e.g. rules for treating /d/, /t/ and/~/in various contexts, or a rule for rewrit-ing y ~ i after soft consonants). 18 rules deal b with the actual phonological alternations and they cover the whole productive phonological system of Czech language. The lexicon using these rules was tested on a newspaper text containing 2,978,320 word forms, with the result of more than 96% analyzed forms. 4 Acknowledgements My thanks to Ken Beesley, who taught me how to work with the Xerox tools, and to my father, Jan Skoumal, for fr~uitful discussions on the draft of tNis paper.
