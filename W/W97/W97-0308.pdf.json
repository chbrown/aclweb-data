We propose a general method for determining agreement between two analyses. We then describe an efficient implementation, which is also modular in that the core of the implementation can be reused regardless of the format of markup used in the corpora. The output of the implementation on the Susanne and Penn treebank corpora is discussed. 1 Introduction We present here a general design for, and modular implementation of, an algorithm for computing areas of agreement between structurally annotated corpora. Roughly speaking, if two corpora bracket off the same stretches of words in their structural analysis of a text, the corpora agree that that stretch of text should be considered a single unit at some level of structure. We will (borrowing a usage from (Church and Gale, 1993) term this agreement (sub)tree alignment.","We make the following assumptions, which appear reasonable for markup schemes with which we are familiar:","Â• the \"content\" of each text consists of a sequence of \"terminal\" elements. That is, the content is a collection of elements generally corresponding to words and punctuation and this will be roughly constant across the two corpora. It may also contain additional elements to represent, for example, the positing of orthographically null categories.","Â• the two corpora whose trees are to be aligned contain identifiable structural markup. That is, structural \"delimiters\" are distinct from other forms of markup and content.","Â• two corpora agree on an analysis when they bracket off the same content.","Â• The corpora may contain additional markup provided this is distinct from content and structural markup.","Our goal, then, is to determine those stretches of a text's content which two corpora agree on. Why might we want to do this? There are several reasons:","Â• increase confidence in markup and determine areas of disagreement If two or more corpora agree on parts of an analysis, one may \"trust\" that choice of grouping more than those groupings on which the corpora differ. Alignment can be used to detect disagreements between manual annotators.","Â• verify preservation of analyses across multiple versions of a corpus If all the subtrees of a corpus are aligned with those of another, then the second is consistent with the first, and represents analyses at least as detailed as those in the first. Such automatic checking will be useful both in the case of manual edits to a corpus, and also in the case where automatic analysis is performed. Â• import markup from one corpus to another If one corpus contains \"richer\" information than another, for example in terms of annotation 75 of syntactic function or of lexical category, the markup from the first may be interpreted with respect to analyses in the second. Â• determine constant markup transformations Having identified aligned subtrees, the labels of a pair of trees may be recorded, and the results for the pair of corpora analysed to determine consistent differences in markup. Â• determine constant tree transformations A set of pairings between aligned subtrees can be used as a bootstrap for semi-automatic markup of corpora.","We can also identify some specific motivations and applications. First, in the automatic determina-tion of subcategorization information, confidence in the choice of subcategorization may be improved by analyses which confirm that subcategorization from other corpora. Second, the algorithm we have developed is robust in the face of minor editorial differences, choice of markup for punctuation, and overall presentation of the corpora. We have processed the Susanne corpus (Sampson, 1995) and Penn treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) to provide tables of word and subtree alignments. Third, on the basis of the computed alignments between the two corpora, and the tree transformations they imply, the possibility is now open to produce, semi-antomatically, versions of those parts of the Brown corpus covered by the Penn treebank but not by Susanne, in a Susanne-like format. Finally, in the development of phrasal parsers, our results can be used to obtain a measure of how contentious the analysis of different phrase types is.","Obviously, the utility of algorithms such as the one we present here is dependent on the quality and reliability of markup in the corpora we process. 2 The Task In this section, we provide a general characterization of agreement in analysis between two corpora.","We assume the existence of two corpora, C l and C rl. The contents of each corpus is a sequence of elements drawn from a collection of terminal elements, markers for the left and right structural delimiters (LSD and RSD, respectively) and possibly other markup irrelevant to the content of the text or its structural analysis. Occurrences of structural delimiters are taken to be properly nested. We assume only that the terminal elements of some corpus can 1for left and right. be determined, and not that the definition of terminal element correspond to some notion of, say, word. A consequence of this is that markers in a corpus for empty elements may be retained, and operated on, even if such markers are additional to the original text, and represent part of a hypothesis as to the text's linguistic organization.","The following sequences can then be computed from each corpus: W (z,*} the terminal elements S {t,*} the terminal elements","and structural delimiters So S is the corpus retaining structural annotation, and W is a \"text only\" version of the corpus. As each of these is a sequence, we can pick out elements of each by an index, that is W~ will pick out the nth terminal element of the left corpus.","The following definitions allow us to refer to structural units (subtrees) within the two corpora. (We omit the superscript indicating which corpus we are dealing with.) Numbering subtrees We number the subtrees in each corpus as follows. If Si is the ith occurrence of LSD in S and Sj is the matching RSD of Si, then the extent of subtree (i) of S is the sequence Si... Sj. The terminal yield of a subtree is then its extent less any occurrences of LSD and RSD. This can be conveniently represented as the stretch of terminal elements included within a pair of structural delimiters, i.e. yield(t) = (k,l) where Wk is the first element in the extent of t and Wt the last. We'll refer to a subtree's number as its index. Let Subtrees(C) be the set of yields in C. Two corollaries The following result will be useful later on: for two subtrees from a corpus, if t < t ~ then either t t is a subtree of t or there is no dominance relation between t and t t.","Likewise, we claim that, if a subtree is greater than unary branching, then it is uniquely identified by its yield. To see this, suppose that there are two distinct subtrees, t, t r such that yield(t) = yield(t t) or = (i,j). Then, no terminal element intervenes between Wi and t's LSD, or between Wj and t's RSD, and the same condition holds of t ~. It must therefore follow that t is a subtree of t ~ or vice versa and that they are connected by a series of only unary branching trees. Alignment of terminal elements We want to compute the minimal set of differences between W l 76","and W r, i.e. a monotone, bijective partial function defined as follows: 2 Let 5 be the largest subset of i x j for 0 < i < length(W l) and 0 < j < length(W r) such that 5 is monotone and bijective, and","5(i)=j if either W/t=W~","or 1 < i < length(Wt), = 1 < j < length(Wr), and Wit+l = W ~ j+l In other words, 6 records exact matches between the left and right corpora, or mismatches involving only a single element, with exact matches to either side. This allows minor editorial differences and choice of markup for terminal elements to have no effect in overall alignment. Aligned subtrees We now offer the following definition. Two trees in C t and C r are aligned, if they share the same yield (under the image of ~), i.e.: (W[, W;) e Subtrees(C r) and (WE(i), W~t(j)/E Subtrees(C t)","Two subtrees are strictly aligned if the above conditions hold and neither tree is a unary branch. (This definition will be extended shortly.) We saw above that, if a tree is not unary branching then its yield is unique. Unary branching In the case of unary branching, the inverse of yield will not be a function. In other words, two subtrees have the same yield. The situation is straightforward if both corpora share the same number of unary trees for some yield: we can pair off subtrees in increasing order of index. (Recall that, under dominance, a higher subtree index indicates domination by a lower index.) In this case we will say that the unary trees in question are also strictly aligned.","If the two corpora differ on the number of unary branches relating two nodes, there is no principled way of pairing off nodes, without exploiting more detailed, and probably corpus- or markup-specific information about the contents of the corpora. Linking to original corpus For each of the corpora we assume we can define two functions, one terminal location will give the location in the original corpus of a terminal element (e.g. a function","2Of course, in the general case, such a function may not be unique: It seems a reasonable assumption in the case of substantial texts in a natural language that the function will be unique (although perhaps empty). from terminal indices to, say, byte offsets in a file), and the other tree location will give the location in the original corpus of a subtree (in terms, say, of byte offsets of the left and right delimiters). Tree locations will therefore include any additional information within the corpus stored between the left and right delimiters. Output of the procedure The following information may be output from this procedure in the form of tables","Â• of subtree indices indicating strict alignment of two trees","Â• a table of pairs of sequences of subtree indices indicating potential alignment","Â• of pairs of terminal element indices, (i.e. the function 5) and","Â• of single terminal element mismatches, for later processing to detect consistent differences in markup.","Â• of the results of applying the functions terminal location and tree location to the relevant information above. This output can be thought of as a form of \"stand off\" annotation, from which other forms of information about the corpora can be derived. 3 A portable implementation In this section we describe the implementation of the above procedure which abstracts away from details of the markup used in any particular corpus. The overall shape of the implementation is shown in Figure 1. The program described here is implemented in Perl. Normalization We can abstract away from details of the markup used in a particular corpus by providing the following externally defined functions.","annotation removal and transformation As our procedure works only in terms of terminal elements and structural annotation, all other information may be removed from a corpus before processing. We also take this opportunity to transform the LSD and RSD used in the corpus into tokens used by the core processor (that is, { and } respectively). We may also choose at this point to normalize other aspects of markup known to consistently differ between the two corpora. 77 leR corpus right corpus , Normalize to token stream /","/ jt / Terminal alignment Figure 1: Overall view of processing","terminal and tree locations Similarly, separate programs may be invoked to provide tables of byte offsets of terminals and start- and endpoints of trees.","With these functions in place, we proceed to the description of the core algorithm.

Subtree indexing and alignment detection We use the following for representation of subtrees and the time-efficient detection of aligned trees. Trees in the right corpus (which we can think of as the target) are represented as elements in a hash table, whose key is computed from the terminal indices of the start and end of its yield. Each element in the hash table is a set of numbers, to allow for the hashing of multiple unary trees to the same cell in the table.","In processing the subtrees for the left corpus, we can simply check whether there is an element in the hash table for the terminal indices of the yield of the tree in the left corpus under the image of the function"]},{"title":"6.","paragraphs":["4 An example","IN this section we give a brief example to illustrate","the operations of the algorithm.

Inputs for this process were a Susanne file and the corresponding \"combined\" file from the treebank (i.e. including part:of-speech information). Recalling that the treebank marks up the relationship between pre-terminal and terminal as a unary tree (and that Susanne doesn't do this), the treebank regularly contains more trees than Susanne.","First, a definition: a tree is maximal if it is not part of another tree within a corpus. We ignore maximal trees of depth one in both corpora (as these correspond to indications of textual units rather than sentence-internal structural markup). Each maximal tree containing a tree of greater than depth one in the treebank may also contain sentence punctuation which is treated within the structural markup. As such markup is typically treated as external to structural annotations within Susanne, trees containing a sentence and sentence punctuation cannot be a possible target for alignment across the two corpora. We can take the number of maximal trees of depth more than one within Susanne as an indication of the number of trees within the treebank which are unalignable as a consequence of decisions about markup. This figure comes to 2431.","With those considerations, we report the following findings:","Â• There are 156584 terminal elements in Susanne and of those we find a total of 145583 (93%) for which a corresponding element is identified in the treebank. The corresponding figure for the treebank is 86% (of 169782 terminal elements in the treebank).","Â• There are 110484 trees in Susanne (including 1952 maximal trees of depth one) and so a total of 108532 potentially aligned trees. Of these 76011 (70%) are aligned with trees in the treebank.","Â• There are 301086 trees in the treebank, of which we can eliminate 169782 as trees indicating preterminals (which includes 122174 containing just a textual delimiter), and an estimated further 2431 as representing trees including sentence punctuation. This gives a total of 128873 (= 59%) of trees in the treebank possibly aligned with those in Susanne are in fact aligned.","The figures above bear out the impression that trees in the Penn treebank are more highly articulated than those in Susanne, even leaving aside the additional structure induced by the treatment of punctuation and preterminals in the treebank.","The entire process of computing the above output completes in approximately fifty minutes on an unloaded Sun SparcStation 20."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Limitations","paragraphs":["We have seen above a formal characterization and implementation of an algorithm for determining the extent of agreement between two corpora. The core algorithm itself and output formats are completely independent of the markup used for the different corpora. The alignments computed for the Susanne corpus and corresponding portion of the Penn treebank have been presented and discussed.","Having computed the alignment of trees across corpora, one option is to compute (either explicitly or in some form of stand-off annotation) a corpus combining the information from both sources, thereby allowing the use of the distinctions made by each corpus at once.","There are many future experiments of obvious in-terest, particularly those to do with examining potential factors in cases of agreement or disagreement:","Â• analysis of consistency of annotation by markup label Certain phrase types may be more consistently annotated than others, so that we can be more confident in our analyses of such phrases."]},{"title":"79","paragraphs":["Â• analysis of consistency of annotation by depth in tree From the above discussion we can see that alignment of maximal trees approximates 100%, while that for terminals approximates 90%. Therefore (and unsurprisingly) the bulk of disagreement lies somewhere in between. Is that disagreement evenly distributed or are there factors to do with the complexity of analysis at play?","These proposals have to do essentially with formal aspects of markup. Other, perhaps more interesting questions, touch on the linguistic content of analyses, and whether for example particular linguistic phenomena are associated with divergence between the corpora.","The assumption that trees within corpora are strictly nested represents an obvious limitation on the scope of the algorithm. In cases where markup is more complex, other strategies will have to be developed for detecting agreement between corpora. That said, the class of markup for which the algorithm presented here is applicable is very large, including perhaps most importantly normalized forms of SGML (Goldfarb, 1990), for example that proposed by (Thompson and McKelvie, 1996). 7 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Chris Brew for conversations on the topics discussed in this paper and the anonymous referees for their comments.
