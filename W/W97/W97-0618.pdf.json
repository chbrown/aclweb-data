Once integrated, the interactions between the components have to be specified. Interactions in dialogue systems can be complex due in part to the many states the system can be in. When porting the system to another domain, parts of the integration process have to be repeated. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a multi-blackboard architecture that is controlled by a set of expert-system like rules. These rules may contain typed variables. Variables can be substituted by representations with an appropriate type stored in the blackboards. Furthermore, the representations in the blackboards allow to represent partial information and to leave disjunctions unresolved. Moreover, the conditions of the rule may depend on the specificity of the representations with which the variables are instantiated. For this reason, the interaction is information-driven. The described system has been implemented and has been integrated with the speech recognizer JANUS. 1 Introduction When building an NLP application, several building blocks have to be integrated to form a working interactive system. Since, in the most cases, the components have been developed separately from one am other, each of them has its own representations for input and output data and are optimized to achieve the task for which they have been designed, but \"not necessarily to optimize integrated behavior.","Partly for this reason, several blackboard and multi-agent systems have been proposed for spoken language processing in the past, one of the first being the HEARSAY system (Erman and Lesser1980). In some of these architectures, fine grained agent interaction may take place. Due to the inherent modularity, these architectures are easily extendible and reconfigurable. However, to our knowledge, little work has been focused on how the specification of this interaction may easily be adapted and extended to new tasks.","We adopt the hypothesis that a dialogue system is supposed to perform a limited set of parametrized actions and that the communicative goal of the user is to make the system perform one of these actions. Thus, we not only assume the dialogue to be task-oriented, we also assume that the behavior of the system is limited to determine which action, including its parameters, is compatible with the information conveyed by the users request and which is not. To do so, we propose to use"]},{"title":"typed","paragraphs":["representations that","exclude the use of inappropriate information for an","unintended action. Together with a type inference","procedure, partially specified requests can be incre-","mentally made more specific by using clarification","dialogues. Contrary to most multi-agent and blackboard sys-","tems in spoken language processing, we propose to","control the interaction of the modules by a set of","rules. The rules contain typed variables that can","be instantiated with the representations stored in","a discourse blackboard. The discourse blackboard","stores four different levels of linguistic represen-","tations. These are orthographic representations (n","best and word n best lists), syntactic/lexical seman-","tic representations (parse trees generated by a se-","mantic parser), the semantic representations of the","utterances, and representations of the objects refer-","ring expressions may refer to. The different modules","may make use of each level of representation to per-","form the action they implement. The advantage of","representing the interaction between the modules in","a set of rules are twofold. First, the rules are just","another parameter that may easily be changed or","adapted if the system is supposed to be ported to","another domain. Second, since the variables in the","rules are substituted with representations stored in","the discourse history, the approach is information-","driven and may take fully into account the specificity","of the information entered by the user. The system has been implemented for a map-","based application in which it is possible to ask for","locations and path descriptions and to make ho-98 tel and restaurant reservations. The system has been integrated with the speech recognizer JANUS (Waibel1996). To illustrate the portability, the system has been ported to a new and independent domain, a system with which fast food can be ordered.","2 Information-centered Representations 2.1 The Type Hierarchy We use typed feature structures as defined in (Carpenter1992) throughout the entire system as representation formalism.

Moreover, for every type, a set of"]},{"title":"appropriate","paragraphs":["features is specified so that type inference is possible.

The representations of a natural language processing system have to account for this fact. Naturally, feature structures are well-suited for representing paxtial information. However, they do not adequately represent ambiguity. For this reason,"]},{"title":"underspecified .feature structures","paragraphs":["have been developed. As feature structures, underspecified feature structures can encode partial information. In addition to feature structures, they are able to leave disjunctions unresolved.

The scope is indicated by curly brackets. The alternatives are represented inside curly brackets. Indices behind types identify the typed feature structure to which this information belongs. If there are no indices, the information belongs to all feature structures. Features that are common to only a subset of all represented feature structures are in the scope of the most specific type that is in common to that subset.","Underspecified feature structures represent sets of feature structures efficiently in that they express both the information that is common to and the information that differs between the feature structures in question. The fact that underspecified feature structures represent informational differences is used when generating clarification questions to generate uniquely referring NPs. 2.3 Generating Noun Phrases and","Clarification Questions Noun phrases containing descriptions of objects are generated by traversing the feature structure representing the object in depth-first order and mapping the features and types to strings. Since underspecifled feature structures represent unresolved disjunctions, they are an adequate point of departure for generating clarification questions. Underspecified feature structures exPlicitly represent the differences 99 between feature structures. To generate a clarification question to disambiguate an underspecified feature structure, a noun phrase for every disjunct is generated. The information in the noun phrase must be specific enough to reduce ambiguity in the underspecified structure. The noun phrases are then filled into a template of the form","0o you mean <npl) ..... <nP~_1> or <~Pn>?

The system consists of multiple blackboards each of which stores a separate database. More-over, a certain number of agents is linked to the system. The agents implement operations on the representations stored in the discourse blackboard in a modular way. The operations are used to formulate rules that control the interaction between blackboards and agents. The rules are evaluated by a central processing unit, the general manager, that passes control to the agents to evaluate their local operations. 3.1 The Agents The task of agents is to perform operations on representations stored in blackboards. To this end, each agent disposes of a set of procedures that execute the actions. To specify the interface with the dialogue system, each agent exports a set of signatures containing information about the number and form of the procedures' parameters to the general manager. When the procedure assigned to a given signature is evaluated, the general manager passes the parameters on to the agent. After having executed the procedure, the agent returns status information and possible return values, if any, to the general manager which, in turn, uses this information to decide upon the control strategy. 3.2 The Blackboards Among the blackboards, there is one distinguished blackboard, called the discourse blackboard that stores different levels of representations of the discourse history. Database blackboards are hooked up to the discourse blackboard to make the representations more specific. 3.2.1 The Database Blackboards","The database blackboards store a set of feature structures. The functionality of a database blackboard is to provide procedures to insert, remove, and lookup feature structures. Any database lookup will return an underspecified feature structure representing all feature structures that are compatible with the feature structure passed to the lookup procedure. 3.2.2 The Representation of Discourse","Aside from the database blackboards, there is one distinguished blackboard, the discourse blackboard representing the discourse history. For the time being, the discourse structure is a list of the generated representations. In order to access all levels of representations, this list is maintained for orthographic, syntactic and semantic representations as well as representations of referred objects which allow the discourse blackboard to be seen as four database blackboards in parallel. Moreover, links exist between the objects to access the different levels. This organiza-tion is similar to the discourse pegs (LuperFoy1995), with the main difference being that discourse pegs compile the different representations in one discourse unit while in our approach the different levels are separated and only accessible via links.

Typed feature structures in the semantic level representing noun phrases can be seen as partial descriptions of objects, each of which is compatible with the description. This allows us to determine the objects by compatibility check. In figure 2 (b), the underspecified feature structure might be the result of a database request completing the description shown in 2 (a). This is the reason why the database"]},{"title":"100","paragraphs":["blackboards are attached to only one of the four levels. Every time a feature structure is added to one of the four levels, the appropriate database procedures, if any, provided by the database blackboards are executed to complete the feature structure. For instance, the object level of the discourse blackboard can be seen as database for anaphora resolution: when the representation of an anaphor is added to the semantic level of the discourse blackboard, the object level of the discourse blackboard is considered to be a standard database blackboard, and the antecedents are determined.","The natural language input is analyzed by the PHOENIX parser developed by Ward (Ward1994). The parser generates a set of parse trees each of which covers a part of the input sentence. The roots of the parse trees are specified by top-level frames. Top-level frames can be changed during dialogue interaction to check if the input is or is not conform to what has been expected. Words not covered by the parse trees rootes at the top-level slots are ignored. The partial semantic parse trees are converted to a semantic representation by traversing the parse tree and applying construction rules to the nodes. The construction rules operate mostly on the semantic slots in the parse trees so that synonymy and para-phrases of expressions can be handled. The semantics of an utterance is given by a set of possibly partially specified feature structures that are stored in a discourse history. Each structure represents the semantics of a phrase of one of the main syntactic categories NP, VP, or PP. Examples of how the semantic representations of a request might look like are given in figure 6 and 7."]},{"title":"4 The Form of Rules","paragraphs":["The interaction of the agents and the blackboards is governed by a set of expert system style rules. The rules are composed of constants, typed variables, functions and predicates. The predicates and functions can tal~e variables over either possibly underspecified feature structures over Type and Feat, feature paths over Feat, or events that enable the communication with the speech recognizer and other external processing modules. 4.1 Constants A constant is given by any type from the type hierarchy. Moreover, integers and strings are considered to be subtypes of the types string and int respectively and are also treated as constants. Constants stand for atomic feature structures whose type is given by the constant name. 4.2 Variables Variables range over feature structures and underspecified feature structures. Variables are typed in the sense that they impose an informational lower bound on the type of the feature structures with which they will be substituted. Names of variables ranging over feature structures have to start with the name of their type, with a capital letter to distinguish variables from constants. Feature structures substituting variables have to be stored in the discourse blackboard. Variables are indexed with the level of representation, as in","Obj : O","Moreover, parts of the feature structures can be accessed by specifying a feature path such as"]},{"title":"Obj : 0Q[eOSITION I X]","paragraphs":["The feature path has to obey the well-typed conditions as imposed by the type hierarchy.","Variables ranging over underspecified feature structures are indicated by curly brackets as in","{Obj_path} :0. Here, too, feature path application","{Obj_path} : 0@[DST]. is possible, the path value of an underspecified feature structure being the underspecified structure of all values of the path when applied to the feature structures represented by the underspecified feature structure. The variables in the rules may be instantiated","with representations on each of the four levels. Con-","sequently, there is, contrary to systems that process","data sequentially, no restriction that predetermines","the point at which some future agent has to perform","an action simly because it relies on a specific level","of representation. This fact makes the architecture","well-suited for repair and rescore mechanisms that","integrate scores from the speech recognizer and se-","mantic domain knowledge. 4.3 Functions Functions as well as predicates have to be introduced by signatures that define informational lower bounds on the arguments (if present) and the return 'value. The signature for the function pkturename that returns a string for any given type that is as least as specific as obj_zoncrete is given by","picturename : obj_concrete+ ~ string where a following '+' or '-' sign indicates whether or not the argument has to be defined when evaluating the function. 4.4 Predicates As is the case with functions, predicates are introduced by signatures. Examples are","unify : bot + xbot+","subsumes : bot + xbot+ for the unification operation and the subsumption relation on feature structures. An example for an application-specific predicate is","draw : string + xstring + xint + xint+ whose purpose it is to draw the icon given by the second argument into the window given by the first argument at the position that is identified by the third and the fourth arguments. 101 4.5 Rules Rules are formed using constants, variables, functions and predicates together with conjunction and implication connectors. They have the general form","pl (t1,1,... ,tl,n~) ,..., pk (tk,1 .... ,t~,~) (tk+,.1 .... ,..., p, (t,.,,...,t,.,,) where the Pi are predicates, and the ti/ are terms constructed over constants, variables and functions.

Consequently, only the rules have to be modified if the system should behave differently. 5.1 Variable substitutions If a rule contains variables, variable substitutions have to be calculated before evaluating the rule. This is done in the following manner. Let v be a variable of the form 0 : l@Tr. All possibly underspecified feature structures of type 0' with 0 E O' that have been added or non-monotonically modified since the last stop of the inference procedure are looked up in the discourse blackboard. If the signature of the function or the predicate requires the argument to be defined, all feature structures for which the path 7r is not defined are removed. From the remaining feature structures, an underspecified feature structure is generated. In the same way, the other variables in the rule are looked up. All possible combinations of instantiations form the set of substitutions. The only way to look up the data stored in the discourse blackboard is to generate variable substitutions. 5.2 Evaluating a rule For each rule to be evaluated, the set of variable substitutions is calculated. For each substitution, the variables of the rules are instantiated and each predicate of the condition is evaluated until either one predicate fails or the condition yields true. Evaluation of a predicate or function means to pass the variable values to the procedure implementing the predicate or function and to leave control to the agent associated with the procedure. If the predicates that form the condition of the rule are verified, the remaining predicates are evaluated. If the evaluation of one of these predicates fails, the name of the failing predicate and the variable instantiations can be passed on to an error handling procedure. :","IThe functionality is foreseen to allow interactive error recovery. If, for example, the answer to a clarification 5.3 Evaluating a Set of Rules The rules are evaluated using a forward chaining inference procedure. The evaluation of the program consists of the subsequent evaluation of the rules, in the order in which they are specified. After termination, all feature structures in the blackboard are marked so as to prevent re-execution of an already applied rule.","The forward-chaining inference procedure allows the system to react information-driven which means that, in essence, the information entered into the system determines which rules are evaluated. Consequently, there is no predetermined dialogue model that predicts the type or the information of the next utterance.","The set of rules forms the program that directs the interaction of the different components given the users' input. Modifying the system's behavior requires modification of the program rather than hardcoding and recompiling. This allows for rapid prototyping. To provide output functionality that can easily be adapted to new domains, the predicates also offer the possibility to call Tcl scripts. 5.4 Examples Our first example is taken from the map application.

First, there is a well-defined uniform access functionality between representations in the discourse and the procedures operating on the representations. The information flow from the linguistic representations to the procedures is governed by the rules and is not hard-coded. This allows future extension of functionality. Moreover, the dialogue program can proceed dependent on the success of the operations performed. Second, the dialogue is controlled by (i) the data stored in the different levels of the discourse blackboard (including resolved database requests), (ii) the rules and (iii) the users input. No interaction is hard coded. This makes the approach information-driven. Third, since the human-computer interaction is controlled by rules, rapid prototyping of different dialogue strategies is possible by providing a different set of rules. Since agents can also function as \"wrappers\" around existing modules, providing uniform access to the functionality of the modules, existing modules can easily be integrated.
