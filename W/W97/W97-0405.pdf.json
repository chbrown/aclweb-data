In this framework, the most important step consists of robustly matching the recognized input expression with the stored examples. This paper presents a probabilistic formalization of analogical matching, and describes how this model is applied to speech translation in the framework of translation by analogy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The la.,~t decade has seen growing interest in the example-based framework for translation of written and spoken language (Nagao, 1984),(Jones, 1996). This approach, sometimes called analogical, case-based, or memory-based, originated with the following insight. In the course of translating an expression, a skilled human translator often recalls a similar translation that she has performed or studied before, and then carries out the new translation by analogy to the previous case, instead of applying a large number of lexical and grammatical rules in her head. In an example-based translation architecture, pairs of bilingual expressions are stored in the example database. The source language input expression is matched against the source language portion of each example pair, and the best matching example is selected. The system then returns the target language portion of the best example ms output. This is illustrated in Figure 1. BHiagusl Example Database Figure 1: Example-based Translation Architecture I.I Pre-translation The example-based approach has certain advantages over traditional rule-based approaches to translating spoken language. Since an analogical system relies on a database of pre-translated example pairs, it results in high translation quality. High translation quality requires not only that the output be grammatically correct, but also that the output sound natural and idiomatic. Spoken utterances consist of larger portions of fully-lexicalized or semi-lexicalized morpheme sequences, the use of which greatly contributes to sounding natural and native-like, but whose meanings are not totally predicatable from their forms (Pawley and Syder, 1983). An analogical system can generate natural-sounding output more easily than a compositional, rule-based system, be-cause it directly uses the correspondences between source-language and target-language expressions."]},{"title":"32 1.2 Robustness","paragraphs":["Another important requirement for spoken language translation is that the system has to be very robust. Spoken utterances contain a lot of disfluencies, such as pronunciation errors, word selection errors, word fragments and repairs. Furthermore, a speech translation module also has to handle the errors introduced by the speech recognition component. In an analogical system, the process that matches the input expression against examples can be very robust, and can always return the best matching output expressions instead of failing completely. 1.3 Improving Translation Quality An additional requirement of an automatic translation system is that it should be possible to improve the translation quality by expending additional effort. In a traditional rule-based system, as the knowledge sources (such ms grammar rules, semantic disambiguation rules, transfer rules, etc.) expand in size, there comes a point at which the complex interrelationships between the different types of information precludes any further improvement. In an analogical system, it is possible to incrementally improve the translation quality by adding more examples to the example database, and by effecting corresponding improvements in the matching function by e.g. refining the thesaurus or re-estimating word similarities from an expanded bilingual corpus. 1.4 The Problem of ScalabiHty Unfortunately, the pure analogical approach lacks scalability. The effort required to acquire and maintain the example database, the cost of the space required to store the examples, and the cost of the time required to search the database can become prohibitively high, since a pure analogical system requires a separate example for every linguistic variation."]},{"title":"2 A Hybrid Analogical Approach","paragraphs":["Since language is productive, a realistic analogical system needs to be able to handle linguistic constructions that do not have an exact match in the example database. Therefore it is important for a system to be able to combine fragments from more than one example expression to cover the input expression.","To meet this requirement, we have designed an architecture for robust, practical translation of spoken language in limited domains that integrates morphological and syntactic linguistic processing with an analogical transfer component. The overall system is described briefly in this section. 2.1 System Architecture The pipelined system architecture, shown in Figure 2, separates speech recognition, morphological"]},{"title":"~i~]l ~ :- ~--- ] : , i~ogoizer ,j [ Morphological Analyzer [","paragraphs":["ii!"]},{"title":"[ $ ' h.er I i","paragraphs":["Analogical ] '~:.~'\"~ ..... . ~,~:~:~N~i~!: Transfer Module .... ~:~ ::~i~i~i"]},{"title":"Target Language Generator","paragraphs":["~ ........... .... ~:::ii~i~i ~---$ ...."]},{"title":",~\"s'p~;'\"~',","paragraphs":["',."]},{"title":"_~.~9.~_ ~_ _',J","paragraphs":["Figure 2: System"]},{"title":"Architecture","paragraphs":["analysis, shallow parsing, and recursive analogical translation into different modules.

It is robust enough to tolerate extragrammaticalities, disfluencies, and the like in the input."]},{"title":"2.3 Analogical Transfer","paragraphs":["The recursive analogical transfer module matches the input shallow syntactic tree against the source language portions of example shallow syntactic trees. The example data is classified into different linguistic constituent levels, such as clause-level examples, phrase-level examples, and word-level exampies. The system tries to match the input against examples of the largest unit.","Once the system finds the best matching exampies of the largest unit, it checks whether there are portions that differ significantly between the input"]},{"title":"33","paragraphs":["and the example. If so. the system performs the analogical matching process again on the identified portion from'the input, using examples of the corresponding smaller unit. This recursive process continues until all parts have been matched. Finally, the target language portions of the selected best matches are comhined to form the complete target language expression.","The analogical matching step is based on a probabilistic formalization of matching by analogy. The details of this model are described in Section 4. 2.4 Target Language Generation The target language generation module is designed to perform a number of linguistic operations, such ms enforcing subject-verb agreement, ensuring that required definiteness information is present (such as English determiners, quantifiers, or possessives), and generating the appropriate inflectional morphology. In our prototype implementation, we are using the PC-KIMMO system for generating English morphology (Ant.worth, 1990). After these operations, the shallow syntactic tree is linearized to create an expression in the target language. 2.5 Speech Synthesis In the final step, spoken output is generated from the target language expression. In our Japanese-Engiish prototype, this step is carried out by the DECTALK system (HMlalaan, 1996)."]},{"title":"3 Advantages of the Hybrid Analogical Approach","paragraphs":["The hybrid approach combines analogical matching and transfer with a rule-baaed component that accounts for one of the fundamental properties of language: Its productiveness.

This means it is easier to port it to different domains, and to apply it to new languages.","We also consider the knowledge sources to be \"natural\". By this we mean that, from the point of view of knowledge representation, each knowledge source captures certain aspects of the translation process in its most natural form. For example, the example data ba.se captures translation correspondences in a natural way - by means of corresponding natural language expressions in the souce and target language, Other, less natural means of knowledge representation would require significantly more effort to acquire and maintain. As a result, it is easier to improve the translation quality by adding and modifying examples, and by modifying the thesaurus (if necessary). 3.2 Examples vs. Syntactic or Semantic"]},{"title":"Grammars","paragraphs":["As described above, analogical translation relies on a database of example pairs which can encode idiomatic translation correspondences at the lexical. phrasal, and clausal manner in a natural way. This is an improvement over previous approaches which rely on syntactic or semantic grammars.","For example, the \"transfer-driven'\" apl)roach of (Sobashima et M., 1994) relies on essentially syntactically-based analysis and transfer rules that are manually annotated with examples by provid-ing a sound formal basis for analogical matching. This requires an extensive effort to create a body of rules that covers all possible expressions, and which can handle extra.grammatical or disfluent input. As an example of a semantic-grammax based approach. \"concept-based\" translation (Mayfield et al., 1995) requires an extensive manual knowledge acquisition effort to create detailed, domain and task-specific templates and semantic grammars. In addition, a heavily semantics-based approach such a.s this work suffers from a lack of generality due to the absence of linguistic processing. 3.3 ;Exa,r~ples vs. Interlingua The framework of Interlingua-based translation rests on the presupposition that there can be a universal, unaxnbiguous, language-neutral,\" and practically (if not formally) sound knowledge representation for-realism to mediate between source and target languages. In practice, defining, maintaining, and extending such a formalism for multiple, not closely related languages has proved to be a major challenge. Analogical speech translation does not rely on this presupposition, and instead seeks to capture intuitive translation correspondences. 3.4 Syntactic and Lexical Distance In the hybrid analogical approach, the example data is categorized by linguistic constituent. For exant-pie, there axe translation example pairs at the clause level, phrase level, and word level. This yields a more efficient search procedure during the matching process, while only assuming non-controversial notions of syntactic constituency. By treating syntactically similarity and semantic similarity as two separate aspects of the matching process, we derive an improvement over methods that combine these two aspects. For example, (Sato and Nagao, 1990} combine a measure of structural similarity with a measure of word distance in order to obtain the overall distance measure that is used for matching."]},{"title":"34 3.5","paragraphs":["Computational Efficiency Analogical translation relies on a large database of example pairs. This incurs a significant computational cost for searching and matching against all the examples, which is proportional to the number of examples multiplied by the average size of the representations of the examples. (In practice, this cost can be mitigated somewhat by clustering and in-dexing schemes for the example databa.se.) Hybrid analogical translation greatly reduces the number of required examples by relying on the generality of linguistic rules.","Pure statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) mltst in principle recover the most probable alignment out of all possible alignments between the input and a translation. While this approach is the-oretically intriguing, it has yet to be shown to be computationally feasible in practice. 3.6 Linguistic Efficiency In addition to computational efficiency, we also consider a factor that might be called \"linguistic efficiency\". We hold that a significant body of system-atic linguistic regularities has been identified that nlust be accounted for somehow during the process of translation. Linguistic efficiency refers to the no-tion of how efficient the system is with regard to these regularities.","In hybrid analogical translation, the use of a morphological and syntactic module for shallow analysis to derive a linguistic representation with syntactic and lexical features allows us to handle phenomena such as inflections, transformations, and language-specific phenomena (such as the English determiner system and certain Japanese constructions that encode politeness information) in a linguistically efficient manner. 3.7 Translation Adequacy In order to be able to provide stylistically and pragmatically adequate translations of spoken language, it is not sufficient to merely ignore or tolerate extragrammaticalities in the input; in many cases, the information carried by such phenomena must be reflected in the target language output. The hybrid analogical approach is able to model such phenomena using probabilistic operators, which are explained in more detail in the next section."]},{"title":"4 A Probabilistic Model for Analogical Matching","paragraphs":["When applied to spoken language, the central step in analogical translation is a robust matching Step that compares the output of the speech recognition component with the contents of the example database. This section presents the probabilistic model that provides a formal basis for this matching step.

Thus, an input expressions I consists of a sequence of words iwl, iw2 ..... iw,~. and a set of features ifl,if2 ..... ifm. Similarly, let the source expression E of an example pair consist of ewl, ew2,..., ewp and efb el2 ..... efq. 4,2 The Noisy Channel Model The \"noisy-channel\" model from information theory has proven highly effective in speech recognition and, more recently, in language understanding (Epstein et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1994). We adopt this model for translation by analogy in the following manner.","Given an input expression, the analogical matching algorithm must determine the example expression that is closest in meaning to the input expression. We denote the probability that an example expression is appropriate for translating some input as the conditional probability of the example, given the input: (1) P(ExamplelInput ) Our aim is to find the example that has the highest conditional probability of being appropriate to translate the given input. We denote that exam-pie with Emax, where the max function chooses the example with the maximum conditional probability: (2) Emax = trmXE~Examples[P(ElI)]","Our approach to determining Ernax is as follows. First, we can use Bayes' Law to obtain a re-expression of the conditional probability that needs to be maximized:","(3) P(E[I)= P(E)P(IIE) P(I) Since the input expression, and therefore P(I). remains constant over different examples, we can disregard the term P(I) in the denominator.

After an initial distribution is estimated, these probabilities can be adjusted to solve translation problems due to idiosyncratic exRmples. 5.2 Alteration Probability Distribution The two distortion operators alter-word and alter-feature perform the function of matching semantically similar words or feature values. If a monolingual or bilingual corpus from the application domain is available, these probability distributions can be estimated using iterative methods. If neither type of corpus is available, the probabilities can be estimated with the aid of a manually-constructed thesaurus. 5.3 Thesaurus-based Estimation A thesaurus is a semantic IA-A hierarchy whose nodes are semantic categories, and whose leaves are words. The traditional method of estimating word similarity, based on counting IS-A links, presupposes that every link encodes equal semantic distance - but in practice, this is never the case (Resnick, 1995). Thus, we adopt a new method for judging semantic distance between two words. If appropriate distributional information for words is available. then the semantic similarity of two words could be estimated from the entropy of their lowest common dominating node"]},{"title":"lcdn: 37 Entropy(Root Node)","paragraphs":["(20) Similarity(ewi, iwj) ,~"]},{"title":"Entropy(lcdn)","paragraphs":["In the absence Of distributional information, the entropy of a node depends only on the number of words that the node dominates. 5.4 Other Distortion Probabilities The probability distributions for adding and deleting words and features can also be estimated from corpora. if available.

At the same time, since the example databa,~e must be adapted for every new domain, it is important to minimize the amount of manual effort. For this reason, the example database was designed in such a way that it is possible to acquire new examples by a semi-automatic method consisting of an automatic extraction step from a bilingual corpus (see. for example, (Watanabe, 1993)), followed by a manual filtering and refinement step."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Further Work","paragraphs":["Ba.~ed on the probabilistic model of analogical matching, we have implemented a prototype that translates from Japanese to English in a limited domain.
