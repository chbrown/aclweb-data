The proposed reestimation algorithm is a variation of the inside-outside algorithm adapted to probabilistic dependency grammars. The inside-outside algorithm is a probabilistic parameter reestimation algorithm for phrase structure grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Dependency grammar represents a sentence structure as a set of dependency links between arbitrary two words in the sentence, and can not be reestimated by the inside-outside algorithm directly. In this paper, non-constituent objects, complete-llnk and complete-sequence are defined as basic units of dependency structure, and the probabilities of them are reestimated. The reestimation and BFP algorithms utilize CYK-style chart and the non-constituent objects as chart entries.

Corpus-based, stochastic grammar induction has many profitable advantages such as simple acquisition and extension of linguistic knowledges, easy treatment of ambiguities by virtue of its innate scoring mechanism, and fail-soi~ reaction to ill-formed or extra-grammatical sentences.","Most of corpus-based grammar inductions have concentrated on phrase structure gramÂ° mars (Black, Lafferty, and Roukos, 1992, Lari and Young, 1990, Magerman, 1994). The typical works on phrase structure grammar induction are as follows(Lari and Young, 1990, Carroll, 1992b): (1) generating all the possible rules, (2) reestimating the probabilities of rules using the inside-outside algorithm, and (3) finally finding a stable grammar by eliminating the rules which have probability values close to 0. Generating all the rules is done by restricting the number of nonterminals and/or the number of the right hand side symbols in the rules and enumerating all the possible combinations. Chen extracts rules by some heuristics and reestimates the probabilities of rules using the inside-outside algorithm (Chen, 1995). The inside-outside algorithm learns a grammar by iteratively adjusting the rule probabilities to minimize the training corpus entropy. It is extensively used as reestimation algorithm for phrase structure grammars.","Most of the works on phrase structure grammar induction, however, have partially succeeded. Estimating phrase structure grammars by minimizing the training corpus on-41 tropy does not lead to the desired grammars which is consistent with human intuitions (de Marcken, 1995). To increase the correctness of the learned grammar, Marcken proposed to include lexical information to the phrase structure grammar. A recent trend of parsing is also to include lexiccal information to increase the correctness (Magerman, 1994, Collir~, 1996). This means that the lack of lexical information in phrase structure grammar is a major weak point for syntactic disambiguation. Besides the lack of lexical information, the induction of phrase structure grnmmar may suffer from structural data sparseness with medium sized training corpus. The structural data sparseness means the lack of information on the grammar rules. An approach to increase the correctness of grammar induction is to learn a grammar from a tree-tagged corpus or bracketed corpus (Pereira and Schabes, 1992, Black, Lafferty, and Roukos, 1992). But the construction of vast sized tree-corpus or bracketed corpus is very labour-intensive and manual construction of such corpus may produce serious inconsistencies. And the structural-data sparseness problem still remains.","The problems of structural-data sparseness and lack of lexical information can be lessened with PDG. Dependency grammar defines a language as a set of dependency relations between any two words. The basic units of sentence structure in DG, the dependency relations are much simpler than the rules in phrase structure grnmmar. So, the search space of dependency grammar may be smaller and the grammar induction may be less affected by the structural-data sparseness. Dependency grammar induction has been studied by Carroll (Carroll, 1992b, Carroll, 1992a). In the works, however, the dependency grammar was rather a restricted form of phrase structure grarnrnarss. Accordingly, they extensively used the inside-outside algorithm to reestimate the grnmmnr and have the same problem of structural-data sparseness.","In this paper, we propose a reestimation algorithm and a best-first parsing algorithm for PDG. The reestimation algorithm is a variation of the inside-outside algorithm adapted to PDG. The inside-outside algorithm is a probabilistic parameter reestimation algorithm for phrase structure grammars in CNF and thus can not be directly used for reestimation of probabilistic dependency grammnrs. We define non-constituent objects, complete-link and complete-sequence as basic units of dependency structure. Both of reestimation algorithm and best-first parsing algorithm utilize a CYK-style chart and the non-constituent objects as chart entries. Both algorithms have O(n s) time complexities.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the basic units and describes best-first parsing algorithm. Section 3 describes the reestimation algorithm. Section 4 shows the experimental results of reestimation algorithm on Korean and finally section 5 concludes this paper."]},{"title":"2 PDG Best First Parsing Algorithm","paragraphs":["Dependency grammar describes a language with a set of head-dependent relations between any two words in the language. Head-dependent relations represent specific relations such as modiflee-modifier, predicate-argument, etc. In general, a functional role is assigned to a dependency link and specifies the syntactic/semantic relation between the head and the dependent. However, in this paper, we use the minimal definition of dependency grnmmar with head-dependent relations only.

It shows also that the train and test entropies are not affected much by the domain nor by the size of training corpus. It may be because the reestimation was done on inter-POS dependencies, which is relatively simple. If the reestimation would be done on the dependencies between POS sequences for ~word-phrase\" or on the dependencies between lexical entities~ the entropies may be affected much by the domain and the size of corpus. We plan such experiments.","Below we show the parsing results of two example Korean sentences. We used the proposed best-first parsing algorithm to find the most probable parse of each sentence. The inter-word-phrase probabilities used for parsing are the reestimated ones for the training set-3. To the right of each Korean word-phrase, the meaning of it in English is given in the square brackets. In the parse representations, each individual inter-word-phrase probability is given to the right of the dependent word-phrase. The probability of each parse is the product of all the inter-word-phrase probabilities in the parse and is given on the top of each parse.

The reestimation algorithm is a variation of the inside-outside algorithm adapted to PDG. In both of the reestimation algorithm and the parsing algorithm, the non-constituent objects, complete-link and complete-sequence, are defined as basic units for dependency structures and a CYK-style chart is utilized. Both algorithms have O(n 3) time complexities and can be used for corpus-based, stochastic I I | i I ! I I I I I I I I I ! I i 54 I","paragraphs":["PDG induction. By experiment on Korean: we have shown that the reestimation algorithm converges to a local minimum and constitute a stable grammar.","Compared to phrase structure grammars, PDG can be a useful and practical scheme for parsing model and language model. It is because dependency tree is much simpler and easily understood than the structure constructed by the phrase structure grammars. Besides the search space of the grammar may be smaller and the effect of structural data sparseness may be less. This also means that the reestimation algorithm for PDG can converge with smaller training corpus. We are planning to evaluate the parsing model based on the reestimated PDG and the PDG-based language model."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Black, E., J. Lafferty, and S.
