It consists of a word-based statistical language model, an initial estimation procedure, and a re-estimation procedure. Initial word frequencies are estimated by counting all possible longest match strings between the training text and the word list. The initial word list is au~nented by identifying words in the training text using a heuristic rule based on character type. The word-based language model is then re-estimated to filter out inappropriate word hypotheses generated by the initial word identification. When the word segmeuter is trained on 3.9M character texts and 1719 initial words, its word segmentation accuracy is 86.3% recall and 82.5% precision. We find that the combination of heuristic word identi~cation and re-estimation is so effective that the initial word list need not be large."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word segmentation is an important problem for Japanese because word boundaries are not marked in its writing system. Other Asian languages such as Chinese and Thai have the same problem. Any Japanese NLP application requ/res word segmentation as the first stage because there are phonological and semantic units whose pronunciation and meaning is not trivially derivable from that of the individual characters. Once word segmentation is done, all established techniques can be exploited to build practically important applications such as spelling correction [Nagata, 1996] and text retrieval [Nie and Brisebois, 1996]","In a sense, Japanese word segmentation is a solved problem if (and only if) we have plenty of segmented training text. Around 95% word segmentation accuracy is reported by using a word-based language model and the Viterbi-like dynamic programi-g procedure [Nagata, 1994, Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1995, Yamamoto, 1996]. However, manually segmented corpora are not always available in a particular target domain and manual segmentation is very expensive.","The goal of our research is unsupervised learning of Japanese word segmentation. That is, to build a Japanese word segmenter from a list of initial words and unsegmented training text. Today, it is easy to obtain a 10K-100K word list from either commercial or public domain on-line Japanese dictionaries. Gigabytes of Japanese text are readily available from newspapers, patents, HTML documents, etc..","Few works have examined unsupervised word segmentation in Japanese. Both [Yamamoto, 1996] and [Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1995] built a word-based language model from unsegmented text 203 using a re-estimation procedure whose initial segmentation was obtained by a rule-based word segreenter. The utility of this approach is limited because it presupposes the existence of a rule-based word segmenter like JUMAN [Matsumoto et al., 1994]. It is impossible to build a word segmenter for a new domain without human intervention.","For Chinese word segmentation, more self-organized approaches have been tried. [Sproat et al., 1996] built a word unigram model using the Viterbi re-estimation whose initial estimates were derived from the frequencies in the corpus of the strings of each word in the lexicon. [Chang et al., 1995] combined a small seed segmented corpus and a large unsegmented corpus to build a word unigram model using the Viterbi re-estimation. [Luo and Roukos, 1996] proposed a re-estimation procedure which alternates word segmentation and word frequency re-estimation on each half of the training text divided into halves.","One of the major problems in unsupervised word segmentation is the treatment of unseen words. [Sproat et al., 1996] wrote lexical rules for each productive morphological process, such as plural noun formation, Chinese personal names, and transliterations of foreign words. [Chang et al., 1995] used a statistical method called \"Two-Class Classifier\", which decided whether the string is actually a word based on the features derived from character N-gram.","In this paper, we present a self-organized method to build a Japanese word segmenter from a small number of basic words and a large amount of unsegmented training text using a novel re-estimation procedure. The major contribution of this paper is its treatment of unseen words. We devised a statistical word formation model for unseen words which can be re-estimated. We show that it is very effective to combine a heuristic initial word identification method with a re-estimation procedure to filter out inappropriate word hypotheses. We also devised a new method to estimate initial word frequencies.","Figure 1 shows the configuration of our Japanese word segmenter. In the following sections, we ffirst describe the statistical language model and the word segmentation algorithm. We then describe the initial word frequency estimation method and the initial word identification method.

Although the estimates by Poisson distribution are not so accurate, they enables us to make a robust and computationaUy efficient word model. 2.3 Viterbi Re-estlmation We used the Viterbi-like dyn~m~c programing procedure described in [Nagata, 1994] to get the most likely word segmentation. The generalized Viterbi algorithm starts from the beginning of the input sentence, and proceeds character by character. At each point in the sentence, R looks up the combination of the best partial word segmentation hypothesis ending at the point and all word hypotheses starting at the point.","We used the Viterbi reoestimation procedure to refine the word unigram model because of its computational efficiency. It involves applying the above segmentation algorithm to a training corpus, using a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies. The best analysis of the corpus is taken to be the true analysis, the frequencies are re-estimated, and the algorithm is repeated until it converges. 206"]},{"title":"3 Initial Word Frequency Estimntion","paragraphs":["3.1 Longest Match We can get a set of initial estimates of the word frequencies by segmenting the training corpus using a heuristic (non-stochastic) dictionary-based word segmenter. In both Japanese and Chinese, one of the most popular non-stochastic dictionary-based approaches is the longest match method 1","There are many variations of the longest match method, possibly augmented with further heuristics. We used a simple greedy algorithm described in [Sproat et al., 1996]. It starts at the beg6nning of the sentence, finds the longest word starting at that point, and then repeats the process starting at the next character until the end of the sentence is reached. We chose the greedy algorithm because it is easy to implement and guaranteed to produce only one segmentation. 3.2 String Frequency [Sproat et al., 1996] also proposed another method to estimate a set of initial word frequencies without segmenting the corpus. It derives the initial estimates from the frequencies in the corpus of the strings of character making up each word in the dictionary whether or not each string is actually an instance of the word in question. The total number of words in the corpus is derived simply by summing the string frequency of each word in the dictionary. Finding (and counting) all instances of a string W in a large text T can be efficiently accomplished by making a data structure known as a sUtrLX array, which is basically a sorted list of all the su~ixes of T [Manber and Myers, 1993]. 3.3 Longest Match String Frequency The estimates of word frequencies by the above string frequency method tend to inflate a lot especially in short words, because of double counts. We devised a slightly improved version which we term the \"longest match string frequency\" method. It counts the instances of string W1 in text T, unless the instance is also a substring of another string W~ in dictionary D.","This method can be implemented by making two suffix arrays, Srr and SD for text T and dictionary D. By using ST, we first make list"]},{"title":"Lw","paragraphs":["of all occurrences of string W in the text. By using SD, we then look up all strings IYÂ¢ in the dictionary that include W as a substring, and make list ~ of all their occurrences in the text by using ST. The longest match string frequency of word W in text T with respect to dictionary D is obtained by counting the number of elements in the set difference .LW --/'W-","For example, if the input sentence is ~~ ~g~---~|r.~-~o \" (talk about the Association of English and the Association of Linguistics) and the dictionary has -r~_~ (linguistics), ~\"","(language), ~ (language study), ~ (association), and ~ (talk). Figure 3 shows the difference of the three methods.","The longest match string frequency (lsf) method considers all possible longest matches in the text, while the greedy longest match (lm) algorithm considers only one possibility. It is obvious that the longest match string frequency method remedies the problem that the string frequency (sf) method consistently and inappropriately favors short words.","The problem of the longest match string frequency method is that if a word W1 is a substring of other word W2 and if W1 always appears as a substring of W2 in the training text, just like \"~","Although [Sproat et al., 1996] calls it '~maximum matching\", we call this method \"longest match\" according to a review on Chinese word segmentation [Wu and Tseng, 1993] and the literal translation of the Japanese name of the method t'~--~. 207"]},{"title":"longest match (lm) c, --o string frequency (sf) longest match string frequency (isf)","paragraphs":["longest match ='~ 1 Â• ~~ o YS~ 1 ~ o","1 total","string frequency 1 1 2 2 3 .~-","lm string freq. 1 0 1 2 1","3 5 Figure 3: Comparison of the initial word frequency estimation methods and ~--~- in the above example, the frequency estimate of W1 becomes 0. Although this rarely happens for a large training text, we have to smooth the word frequencies. 4 Initial Word Identification Method To a first approximation, a point in the text where character type changes is likely to be a word boundary. This is a popular heuristics in Japanese word segmentation. To help readers understand the heuristics, we have to give a brief introduction to the Japanese writing system.","In contemporary Japanese, there are at least five different types of characters other than punctuation maxks:"]},{"title":"kanji, hiragana, katakana,","paragraphs":["Roman alphabet, and Arabic numeral."]},{"title":"Kanfi which","paragraphs":["means 'Chinese character' is used for both Chinese origin words and Japanese words semantically equivalent to Chinese characters.

Ia fact, using the estimated word frequencies obtaiued by the heuristics results in poor segmentation accuracy 2. We found, however, that it is very effective to use the character type based word segmenter as a lexical acquisition tool to augment the initial word list.","The initial word identification procedwe is as follows.

The first type is not an error but the ambiguity resulting from inconsistent manual segmentation, or the intrinsic indeterminacy of Japanese word segmentation. For example, in the manually segmented corpus, we found the string ~-[].&~ (foreign laborer) is identified as one word in some places while in others it is divided into two words ~l-m)~ (foreigner) and ~ (laborer). However, the word unigram based segmenter consistently identifies it as a single word.

For example, the word ~#~ (funny) is segmented into two word hypotheses ~ (rare) and ~ (strange). This is because ~'~ is included in the dictionary.

For example, from the phrase Y~ (Soviet Union) I ~ (made-SUFFIX) I l~ (tank), which means \"Soviet Union-made tank\", the initial word identifier extracts two word hypotheses Y and ~K, where the former is written in"]},{"title":"katakana","paragraphs":["and the latter is written in"]},{"title":"kanfi.","paragraphs":["If ~ and ~ is in the dictionary, the two erroneous word hypotheses >' and ~I~iK are removed and the correct word t~ is added to the dictionary after re-estimation."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have presented a self-organized method that builds a stochastic Japanese word segmenter from a small word list and a large unsegmented text. We found that it is very effective to augment the initial word list with automatically extracted words using character type heuristics. Re-estimation helps in adjusting word frequencies and removing inappropriate word hypotheses, although it has little impact on word segmentation accuracy if the word unigram model is used.","The major drawbacks of the current word segmenter is its breakdown of unknown words whose substrings coincide with other words in the dictionary, and the erroneous longest match at the sequence of functional words written in"]},{"title":"hiragana.","paragraphs":["The first drawback results from the character unigram based word model that prefers short words, while the second drawback results from the nature of the word tmigram model which prefers fewest words segmentation.","One may argue that we could use the word bigzam model. However, we don't know how we can estimate the initial word bigram frequencies from scratch. One may also argue that we could use the character bigram in the word model. However, the character bigram for the word model must be computed from segmented texts. Both of these suggest that we need a word segmenter to build a more sophisticated word segmenter. Therefore, as a next step of our research, we are thinking of using the proposed unigram based word segmenter to obtain the initial estimates of the word bigrams and the word-based character bigr~m~ which will then be refined by a re.estimation procedure."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Chang et al., 1995] Jing-Shin Chang, Yi-Chung Lin, and Keh-Yih Su. 1995.
