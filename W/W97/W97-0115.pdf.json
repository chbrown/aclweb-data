Since they are very common in scientific articles, the ability to automatic identification of terminology could greatly assist any domain related natural language processing applications. Unfortunately, the collection of terminology information is very difficult and requires much tedious and time consuming manual work. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to extract technical words and phrases from on-line corpora. This approach can significantly reduce the manual effort in the generation of terminology dictionary. First, those domain specific words which have no entries in the universal dictionary are identified. Second, terminology words are extracted from these new words as well as the universal dictionary. Then compound words are extracted from the combination of terminology words and other words. The final computer terminology dictionary contains 1,034 words and 3,471 compound words. Experiment shows that 89.5 percent of all the occurrences of computer terminology can be identified with this terminology dictionary. keyword: Chi-square Test, Automatic Indexing, Mutual Information 1."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Terminologies are specialized words and compound words used in a particular domain, such as computer science. They are extensively used in scientific articles. Previous research had shown that about 25% of the words in science abstract were technical words [ 6 ]. Therefore, the ability to automatic identification of terminology could greatly aid any domain related natural language processing applications, such as automatic indexing, information retrieval and document categorization. For example, automatic indexing is the foundation of many other relevant tasks. It needs to automatically identify those words which most appropriately reflect a text's theme. Since terminologies are highly relevant to the text's domain, they are proved to be much valuable index words. Even in more universal applications such as semantic analysis and translation, terminologies also play important roles, and therefore require special treatment.","Unfortunately, the identification of terminology is a hard work. Most terminologies don't have entries in universal dictionaries. In addition, terminology dictionaries are hilly variable in the coverage. For example, computer science dictionaries' coverage of computer science terminology ranged from 24% to 66% [ 6] . * This paper is supported by Chinese Natural Science Foundation and high technology 863 project. 142"]},{"title":"! I i I i ., I I","paragraphs":["With regard to Chinese, the identification procedure is even more difficult. First, there are scarcely any available machine readable Chinese dictionaries for specialized domains. Therefore, the generation of terminology dictionary would inevitably require a great deal of tedious and time consuming manual work. Second, in most Indo-European languages, even a word couldn't be found in the dictionary, it still could be separated by the spaces between it and neighboring words; however, Chinese is written in character sequences, with no delimiters between successive words. Hence the first step of Chinese information processing is necessarily to segment the character sequences into word sequences. The main knowledge base of segmentation is the dictionary. However, most of the terminologies couldn't be found in the dictionary. Therefore, before further processing, those domain specific words which are unavailable in the dictionary should be extracted and added to it. This procedure is called new word extraction.","Due to the availability of large scale on-line real text, corpus based natural language research has become one of the focuses of computational linguistics. Among all the corpus l~ased researches, some of them are quite similar to the work reported here, including sublanguage vocabulary identification [ 6 ] , automatic suggestion of significant terminology [ 15 ] , identification and translation of technical terminology[ 3 ], automatic extraction of terminology [4] . For example, Haas introduced a method for automatic identification of snblanguage vocabulary words. First, words that could be easily identified as belonging to the vocabulary of the given domain were extracted, then the rest of the vocabulary were extracted using these seed words.","Another relevant research is statistical collocation extraction. In fact, terminology phrase belongs to one certain kind of collocation m fixed collocation, whether two or more words can compose a collocation is measured by the correlation coefficient of these words [ 11 ] . If these words' correlation coefficient is large enough, they may probably make up a collocation. There are many statistical methods to calculate words' correlation coefficient, including co-occtarence frequency [ 10], mutual information [ 1 ] ,generalized likelihood estimation [5], chi-square test","[2] [7] , Dice coefficient [ 11 ] , etc.","There are also many valuable works in China, especially about the distinctive new word extraction of Chinese text. Wang Kai-zhu presented a statistical method to extract possible words from texts. Weights of possible words were calculated using their frequency and length information [ 13] . Zhang Shu-wu also presented a strategy which made use of co-occurrence frequencies to collect new words [ 14] . Pascale Fung extended a tool originally designed for extracting English compounds - CXtract to collect new words in order to improve the segmentation precision [ 9 ] .","Due to the distinct characteristic of Chinese, there is still no systematic approach to generate practical and relatively complete Chinese terminology dictionaries from on-line corpora. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to extract technical words and phrases from corpora. This approach integrates such methods as new word collecting, terminology word extraction and terminology phrase generation. It can significantly reduce the manual effort in the generation of terminology dictionary. First, those domain specific words which can't be found in the universal dictionary are identified. Second, terminology words are extracted from these new 143 words as well as the universal dictionary. Then compound words which are combined by terminology words and other words are generated.","The following sections are organized as such: Section 2 introduces the identification of domain specific words; Section 3 describes how to extract terminology words from the universal dictionary; Section 4 presents the method for terminology phrase extraction; Section 5 provides detailed experimental results; The final section is the concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2. New Word Extraction","paragraphs":["A Chinese word is usually composed of no more than 4 Chinese characters. Most of the words are uni-grams, hi-grams, tri-grams and 4-grams. Uni-grams only consist of one character, and most of them are common words and then can be found in universal dictionaries. The number of n-grams with n>4 is very small, and the occurrence of most of them is rare. Among the 9000 most frequently used words, far below 1% of them are longer than 4 characters [ 9 ] . In addition, most of these words are idioms or terminologies, then can be extracted in the phrase generation phase. Therefore, in this section, only bi-grams, tri-grams and 4-grams are taken imo consideration.","Now consider two neighboring characters A and B. We call these two characters as a bi-gram candidate. They belong to either the same word, or two neighboring words. We can intuitively suppose that the two characters are more correlate to each other when they belong to the same word. Therefore, we may choose a statistic to measure the correlation coefficient of neighboring characters, then use this statistic to judge the probability that they belong to the same word.","The correlation coefficient could be measured by several methods, such as co-occurrence frequency, mutual information, generalized likelihood estimation, chi-square test, Dice coefficient. Among them, chi-square test needs special attention. First, it is closely related to the binomial distribution model of text. Second, the computation is quite simple. Experiment in section 5 also showed that it could lead to better performance. Following is the detailed description of this method.","Compare each bi-gram (4, B) candidate to every two neighboring characters ( C,,"]},{"title":"C,-1)","paragraphs":["in the text sequence C-- ("]},{"title":"CIC:'\"C,C,-z \"\"Cn","paragraphs":["), where n is the size of the text, and record the","comparison results.

In these tables, many candidates are available in the universal dictionary, others are potential words. These potential words are carefully examined by skillful computer professionals, and many of them are accepted and then appended to the dictionary in order to improve segmentation precision. These words are called new words. Human intervention is still inevitable, since statistical methods not only generate useful, but also noisy words.

Terminology Phrase Generation","paragraphs":["Terminology phrases are word pairs composed of terminology words and other words. Current research only concerns word pairs. Terminology phrases are generated in three steps.","At the first step, all the candidate phrases are extracted. The whole corpus is segmented with the augmented dictionary in advance. A small window is put over each terminology word appearing in the text sequence. Candidate terminology phrases are those word pairs which are composed of one terminology word and another word inside this terminology's border window. Those word pair's with too low frequencies are filtered out.","Whether a word pair is a phrase is measured by its weight. At the next step, most of candidates are also filtered out if their weights are too small. A word pair's weight is mainly decided by its correlation coefficient. In addition, two heuristic rules are adopted to modify the weights: Rule 1: If a word pair is composed of two terminology words, its weight is strengthened. Rule 2: If a word pair contains function words, it is also filtered out. A stop word table is introduced for this reason. This table contains more than 1000 Chinese function words, such as"]},{"title":"\"~ (of)\"and\"~ (be)\".","paragraphs":["At the last step, all the remaining word pairs are manually examined.

One is a Computer World corpus (CW). It is composed of all articles of the newspaper \"Computer World ( ~t'~'LIJ~L~- )\" from 1990 to 1994.

It contains more than 8,000 I"]},{"title":"/ I 1 I I i I 146","paragraphs":["news articles with 10M bytes of text.","CW corpus contains many computer terminologies, most of which just appeared in last two decades. Therefore, only a small number of them have entries in universal dictionaries. XN corpus also contains many new words, but the number is much smaller.","To collect new words, each article was scanned and all the bi-gram, tri-gram and 4-gram candidates with frequency greater than threshold T] were extracted ( for CW corpus, Tr=4, for XN corpus, T~=2 ). In addition, some shorter candidates were actually parts of longer ones, and couldn't exist independently. For example, every time \"~31~rL\" was seen in the text, it followed \"i~'; every time \"l~\" was seen, it was followed by \"~:\". So \"~g~L\" and \"[~g\" are only parts of longer candidates \"~ ( computer )\" and \"1~: (Afghanistan)\". Thus they should be removed from candidate tables.","The remaining candidates were sorted by their correlation coefficient in descending order. Those candidates on the top of the table have higher probability to be real words. To evaluate the computing methods, we may consider the distribution in the candidate table of those words available in the dictionary. These words are called as available words. Let D be the sorted candidate table, DS be a sub.table of D starting from the beginning of D. Two evaluation standards precision and recall were defined as follows:","Precision ofDS = Number of available words in DS /Number of candidates in DS;","Recall ofDS = Number of available words in DS/Number of all available words in D.","Obviously, since many new words have no entries in the dictionary, the real precision and recall should be somewhat higher.

When recaU is not much high ( less than 40-50%), which means Bat only those top candidates are considered, CHI method is the best. When recall 147 becomes higher, MI is better than others. Since only top of the table should be further examined manually, CHI method was chosen.","Figure 3 demonstrates the Recall-Precision curves of two corpora using CHI method. Although XN corpus is only one tenth of CW in size, it gains better results. This result can be attributed to the fact that XN corpus contains less new words.","There are more than 400,000 bi-gram candidates in CW corpus. Among them, 17,779 are available words. Only 61,584 candidates have frequencies greater than Ti(Ti=4), including 7,089 available words. These candidates compose the bi-gram candidate table. New words are extracted from the top 16% of this table. Among these 9,856 high-rank candidates, 4,041 are available in the dictionary, which amount to 57% of all the available words in the whole table. The remaining 5,815 were potential new words and then further examined by computer professionals. Finally, 1,699 were accepted. Similar results were obtained from tri-gram and 4-gram candidates. A little more differently, the proportion of available words in tri-grarn and 4-gram candidate tables is much smaller than in hi-gram table. Therefore, new words were only extracted from the top 4% tri-grams and the top 2% 4-grams. The quantities of accepted tri-grams and 4-grams is also smaller than that of bi-grarns. Table 2 presents the vocabulary distribution of CW corpus. Among the whole vocabulary, more than 10% are extracted new words. Later the recall and precision were recalculated using the augmented dictionary.

In addition, to make sure only a small portion of terminology words had been missed, 1,000 words were randomly selected from the rest 23,329 words and only 4 were found to be terminologies.

These candidates' weights were computed in the method introduced in section 4. Then they were sorted in descending weight order. Figure 5 shows the approximate recall-precision curve of terminology phrase extraction. The reason for approximate evaluation was that it was impossible to manually examine all 35,178 terminology phrases, therefore only randomly selected 3,000 candidates were examined. From figure 5, we can find that the performance of phrase extraction wasn't as good as that of word extraction. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that some highly associated candidates still couldn't compose terminology phrases. Most of these pseudo phrases can be divided into two classes: Class 1: The two words compose a Verb.Object, Subject-Verb, or other phrases. For example, \"~ (left mouse key) ~ig~ (drag)\". Class 2: The two words are two highly associate words, but have no direct syntactic relations. For example, \"~]~-~ ~-)~\" (two Chinese character input methods). In fact, similar phenomena can also be found in English [8] .Therefore, the precision will surely be improved when syntactic information is used to further filter candidates.","Figure 5: Recall-Precision Curve of Phrase Table","1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6","Precision 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1","0 I I I l","0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8","Recall","Terminology phrases were extracted from the top 20% ( with precision of about 50%) terminology phrase candidates, these candidates were examined manually and 3,471 were accepted.

Conclusion","This research presents a chi-square method based approach to semi-automatically generate terminology dictionaries. This approach integrates such methods as new word collecting, terminology word extraction and terminology phrase generation. It significantly reduces most of the hard work which should be done manually, and reduce the effort and time which are needed to transport a natural language processing work from one domain to another. Using this terminology dictionary, encouraging results has been achieved about the coverage of terminologies.","This research has practical importance in many domain related natural language applications. It can improve indexing results. It can help to decide texts' category. It also can help to rank documents with user queries. In fact, this approach will soon be embedded into an integrated Chinese information processing system - FDASCT [ 12] .","Our future work mainly includes the utilization of deeper text processing techniques such as part of speech tagging and partial syntactic analysis in phrase generation. Word pairs would be discarded if there are no consistent syntactic relations between constituent words. And those nonnoun phrases would also be discarded since terminologies are always nouns. Thus manual effort can be further reduced. 151"]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["[ 1 ] Church ICW, Hanks P., Word Association Norms, Mutual Information, and Lexicography, Computational","Linguistic, 16:1, 1990,22 -- 29 [ 2 ] Church K.W, Gale W.A. et. al, Using Statistics in Lexical Analysis, Lexical Aeqnisilion: Using On-line Resources to Build a Lexicon, edited by Uri Zemik, Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, New Jersey, 115-165","[ 3 ] Dagan I. and Church K.W, Termight: ldentO~,ing and translating technical terminology, ANLP, 34.-..40, 1994","[ 4 ] Daille B., Study and implementation of combined techniques for automatic extraction of terminology, 29-36, The Balancing Act, Combining Symbolic and Statistical Approaches to Language - Proceedings of the Workshop, 1994","[ 5 ] Dunning T., Accurate Methods for the Statistics of Surprise and Coincidence, Computational Linguistic 19:1, 1993, 61 -- 74","[ 6 ] Haas, St~hanie, He Shaoyi.
