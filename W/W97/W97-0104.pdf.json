Hindle and Rooth(1993) tried to use word association information to disambiguate the prepositional phrase attachment problem in English. Brill(1993a) proposed a transformation-based error.driven automatic learning method, which has been used in part-of-speech(POS) tagging[Bri92], text chunking[RM95] and sentence bracketing[Bri93b]. Bod's data oriented parsing technique directly used an annotated corpus as a stochastic grammar for parsing[RB93]. Based on the statistical decision-tree models automatically learned from treebank, Magerman's SPATI~R parser showed good performance in parsing Wall Street Journal texts[DM95]. Collins(1996) described a statistical parser based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in treebank, which can perform at least as well as SPATTER.","As a distinctive language, Chinese has hlany characteristics different from English. Although Chinese information processing techniques have made great progress since 1980, how to use statistical information efficiently in Chinese parser is still a virgin land waiting to explore.

It tries to parse the Chinese sentences with correct segmentation and POS tagging information through the following processing stages: 1) to predict constituent boundaries using local context statistics, 2) to match the open and close brackets and produce syntactic trees using boundary tag distribution data and syntactic tag reduction rules. 3) to disambiguate parse trees using stochastic"]},{"title":"!1 tl I: ! f, ! i !

Traditionally, disambiguation problems in parsing have been addressed by enumerating possibilities and explicitly declaring knowledge which might aid most interesting natural language processing problems. As the large.scale annotated corpora become available nowadays, automatic knowledge acquisition from them becomes a new efficient approach and has been widely used in many natural language processing systems.","Treebanks are the collections of sentences marked with syntactic constituent structure trees. The statistics extracted from a large scale treebank will show useful syntactic distribution principles and be very helpful for disambiguation in a parser. Some statistical data and rules used in our parser are briefly described as follows:","(1) boundary distribution data(Sl)","This group of data shows the different influence of context information on the constituent boundaries in a sentence, counted by the co-occurrence frequencies of different constituent boundary labels(b~ with the word(w~) and pmt-of-speech(POS) tags(ti), which include: (a) the co-occurrence frequencies with functional words: ~wi, bi); (b) the co-occurrence frequencies with a single POS tag: j~ts,b~); (c) the co-occurrence frequencies wig local POS tags:f(bi, ti, ti+j) or./~ti.s,"]},{"title":"ti, b+).","paragraphs":["They play an","important role in the prediction of constituent boundary locations.","(2) Syntactic tag reduction data(S2)","This group of data records the possibilities for the constituent structures to be reduced as different","syntactic tags, represented by a set of statistical rules:","constituent structure -> {syntactic tag, reduction probability}.","For example, the rule v+n -> vp 0.93, np 0.0'7 indicates that a syntactic constituent composed by a","verb(v) and a noun(n) can be reduced as a verb phrase(vP) with the probability 0.93, and as a noun","phrase(rip) only 0.07 ~. Based on them, it is easy to determinate the suitable syntactic tag for a parsed","constituent according to its internal structure components. In Chinese, there arc a group of verbs with especial synlactic functions. They can directly modify a noun, such as the verb \"xun//an(Wain)\" in the phrase \"xurd/o.n ~rTumccha(training handbook)\".
