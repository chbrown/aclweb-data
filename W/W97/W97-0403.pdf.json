A new categorization of spoken language phenomena into essentially non-meaningful \"speech errors\", and purposeful \"natural speech properties\" is introduced, and the manner in which natural speech properties convey pragmatic information is described. Finally, an extension of the analogical speech translation approach is proposed that accounts for such higher-level pragmatic information."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Traditional grammar, at its origin highly prescriptive, was aimed at written sentences, and completely ignored all characteristics of spoken language. This distinction was codified in Chomsky's competence-performance distinction (Chomsky, 1965). Chomsky singled out the abstract notion of grammatical competence, the rules or constraints characterize grammatical sentences, as the proper subject for the study of language. All other characteristics of language were relegated to the category of language performance, essentially meaningless by-products of the system that happens to implement language production in humans. Traditional approaches to computational linguistics have also focused on the rules of grammar. 1.1 Spoken Language Spoken language, however, has many characteristics that are different from written language. When an utterance is produced on-line, the speaker does not have a lot of time to think and plan the entire utterance. For this reason, spoken utterances tend to be relatively short, have less complex structure, and contain more fixed or semi-fixed expressions than written sentences. At the same time, the on-line nature of spoken language also gives rise to so-called \"disfluencies'. Furthermore, written communication usually aims at an accurate transfer of information, in an interactive mode of verbal communication, each utterance often carries larger portion of pragmatic information such as a variety of illocutionary and perlocutionary forces."]},{"title":"1.2 Pragmatic Information","paragraphs":["Accurate handling of pragmatic information in speech translation is gaining importance as speech recognition technology improves. As can be observed in communications between a native speaker and an intermediate/advanced second-language learner, pragmatic inappropriateness in otherwise perfectly grammatical utterances causes more communicational damage than purely syntactic mistakes, since the listener tends to interpret it as intentional or malicious, instead of viewing it as a result of the speaker's linguistic incompetence."]},{"title":"2 Previous Approaches: Recognizing Speech Act Types","paragraphs":["For the reasons outlined above, it is important to handle pragmatic information in spoken language translation. The most studied area in pragmatics has been the illocutionary force of utterances. This type of information has been shown to be useful for reducing ambiguities and improving the accuracy of speech recognition and translation in many systems (Woszczyna and Waibel, 1994), (Nagata, 1992), (qu et al., 1996). 2.1 Rule-based Approaches One of the traditional approaches to this area of pragmatics is to recognize speech act types compositionally using syntactic and semantic rules plus"]},{"title":"16","paragraphs":["a few pragmatic principles, such as felicity conditions for each speech act type. Spoken language expressions, however, tend to deviate from conven-tional grammars, and a system consisting of layers of rule-based modules is often too brittle to handle naturally-occurring spoken input. Furthermore, there are a number of fully- or semi-lexicalized morpheme sequences that carry specific illocutionary forces but that are not totally predictable from its forms. These sequences have an institutionalized function in the particular community, and are best accounted holistically rather than analytically (Paw-Icy and Syder, 1983). 2.2 Pattern Matching Many spoken language systems have thus been using robust pattern-matching techniques to overcome these problems. They use detailed, task-specific templates and semantic grammars, which can recognize various fixed phrases to mark speech act types while skipping over disflucncies in the input. This method has been shown to be successful in many dialoguc systems (Jackson ct al., 1991), (Ward, 1991)."]},{"title":"3 Other Pragmatic Information","paragraphs":["When people engage in face-to-face dialogues, the focus is usually on establishing and maintaining a good relationship among the interlocutors, rather than mere transfer of information.

This is not possible, how-ever, in a spoken language translation system that acts as a human-human verbal communication aid, where the expressive information encoded in utterances plays a far bigger role. For example, if we consider a conversation between two persons who meet for the first time at a party and extract only propositionally meaningful chunks and translate them, the result will resemble an interrogation rather than a pleasant conversation. 3.2 Translating Pragmatic Information In our work, we take the view that important pragmatic information is actually encoded in many of the characteristics of spoken language that have been viewed as defective or ill-formed. We believe that many of such characteristics carry specific communicative functions that must be preserved in order so-called \"disfluencies\""]},{"title":"(","paragraphs":["utterance strategies Figure 1: Communication vs. Performance to obtain translations with high stylistic and pragmatic accuracy.

They concern the speaker's intention of \"how to say\" an utterance, as opposed to \"what to say\" (propositional content) of the utterance. For this reason, their semantics are non-truth-conditional. Utterance strategies range from grammatically-encoded information to extra-linguistic devices such as facial expressions and body language, to natural speech properties (Figure 1). 4.5 Distortion Model Based on this discussion, we arrive at the two-level model of spoken language phenomena shown in Figure 2. The speaker's intention of \"what to say\" (in-tended propositional content) is combined with the speaker's intention of \"how to say it\" (pragmatic utterance strategies) to form the \"intended utterance\", which contains natural speech properties. When the speaker actually produces the utterance, speech performance errors might occur, resulting in the \"actual utterance\" that is to be interpreted by the listener. We believe that spoken language translation systems need to be able to translate what is conveyed through natural speech properties in order to fully convey the speaker's intentions in verbal communication."]},{"title":"5 Communicating Pragmatic Information","paragraphs":["This section discusses the different types of pragmatic information that play a role in spoken dialogues. 5.1 Discourse Structure One type of pragmatic information relates to signaling discourse structure.

There are two different types of politeness expressed in spoken language, \"discernment\" and \"volition\" (Ide, 1989). Discernment refers to the speaker's recognition of her relationship with the addressee and the situation. This is mainly expressed through the speaker's choice of conversational topic, lexical items, and syntactic structures. For example, the same conversational participants may use different linguistic forms depending on the speech situation, such as a discussion during a formal meeting versus an informal hallway-chat after the meeting. The choice of formal and informal predicate forms in Japanese and the choice of distant and"]},{"title":"18","paragraphs":["familiar second person pronouns in French and German are examples of lexically encoded discernment markers.","The volitional aspect of politeness is usually ex-\" pressed through projection of \"face\". There are two distinct aspects of face, \"positive face\" and \"negative face\" in the theory of (Brown and Levinson, 1987), which are rephrased as involvement and independence, respectively, in (Scollon and Scollon, 1995). Positive face or involvement concerns one's desire to be liked by others, to be involved with others, and to be part of the same group. Negative face or independence, on the other hand, concerns one's desire to maintain privacy and independence, and to avoid the imposition or dominance of others. 5.3 Positive Face Strategies to project positive face, which are called \"positive politeness strategies\" (Brown and Levinson, 1987) or \"solidarity politeness\" (Scollon and Scollon, 1995), can be carried out by the use of in-tensifiers accompanying positively affecting speech acts such as thanking and complimenting. The use of the first-person plural pronoun we in English is also an example of solidarity politeness. Most of the other linguistic items used in solidarity politeness strategies, however, do not bear propositional content. For example, the speaker may try to appeal to mutual beliefs or affective common ground by using the English interjection you know and the Japanese sentence-final particle ne (Cook, 1988). The speaker may also try to invite the addressee's involvement by using hearer-oriented question tags such as right, all right, okay, would you or will you, or by using devices to attract the addressee's attention such as look, listen, hey and informal or affectionate address terms.","Telegraphic utterances that omit obvious information can be interpreted as a strategy to emphasize common knowledge among the interlocutors. Involvement strategies \"assert the speaker's right to advance his or her own position on the grounds that the listener will be equally interested in that position and in advancing his or her own position (Scollon and Scollon, 1995):85\". The speaker may achieve this by displaying an assertive, \"non-challengeable attitude\" (Kawanishi, 1994) with the Japanese janai form, or by aligning herself and the listener on the same side by using distant demonstrative ano (that) (Cook, 1993). 5.4 Negative Face Strategies to project negative face, which are called \"negative politeness\" or \"deference politeness\", are mainly carried out by the use of \"toning down\" devices accompanying negatively affecting speech acts such as criticizing, giving advice, requesting, or refusing an offer or request. Expressions of the speaker's hesitation or tentativeness, such as hedges (well, I don't know, I think, I am wondering if...), use of the interrogative form, or the past tense I was wondering if... or the subjunctive mood it would be better are examples of such devices to soften the force of the utterance, and to make it easier for the addressee to refuse. Sometimes even questions to ask permissions to ask a question are used to give the addressees ways to answer negatively without directly refusing the request, as shown in the following example given (Yule, 1996), pp.64-65:","I know you're busy, but might I ask you","if-em-if you happen to have an extra pen","that I could, you know-eh-maybe borrow?","There are also content \"downtoners\" such as little, a bit, just, ... and so on, and the use of colloquial expressions (such as to give a hand instead of to help), which trivialize the action mentioned in the utterance. The speaker may also try to create distance between the addressee by avoiding reference to both the speaker and the addressee, as in an agentless passive sentence I would like a reservation to be made. 5.5 Expressing Attitude Another type of utterance strategy expresses the speaker's attitude towards the propositional content in the utterance. This information can be conveyed through various forms of evidential markers and devices to express the speaker's certainty/uncertainty, or the speaker's perspective."]},{"title":"6 Handling Pragmatic Information in Speech Translation","paragraphs":["In the context of spoken language translation, the crucial characteristic of pragmatic utterance strategies is that the surface forms in which they are realized are often different across languages. 6.1 Example: English vs. Japanese","Politeness For example, softening the effect of an imperative force by questioning the addressee's ability to perform the action (Can you do X for me ?) or assert-ing the speaker's desire (I would like you to do X for me) can be found across many languages. How-ever, strategies to further reduce the imposing effect of these request forms are usually not directly transferable across languages. In English, a more polite way of phrasing the request Can you do X for me ? would be the use of the subjunctive mood, Could you do X for me ?, but no corresponding form exists in Japanese. Instead, the Japanese speaker may use the negative form X shire itadakemasen ka?. If this Japanese form is translated literally into English, the result would be Can't you do X for me ?, which has a quite different pragmatic meaning, and definitely does not convey the same degree of politeness as the Japanese expression."]},{"title":"19","paragraphs":["• ..Compute :i Ci~i!Examp!~i !i Given ~ ... Figure 3: Computing an Interpretation 6.2 Abstract Pragmatic Transfer To what extent word order can be altered, and how easily known information can be elided, are also largely dependent on the syntax of each language. One strategy that is realized as fronting may be marked as intonation in another language. It is not sufficient, therefore, to recognize the surface form of each pragmatic strategy and directly transfer it to the same surface form in another language. Spoken language systems are thus required to transfer pragmatic utterance strategies at a more abstract level and to be able to recognize and generate appropriate surface forms in each language, in order to achieve high-quallty translation. In our approach, we treat pragmatic strategies as additional information that are superimposed upon basic propositional content, try to recognize and extract them, and transfer them to the appropriate target language expressions.","7 An Analogical Framework for Translating Pragmatics This section gives a brief overview of our approach to translating spoken language. 7.1 The Role of Lexicallzation Our approach to translating spoken utterances resonates well with the insights of (Pawley and Syder, 1983) about native speakers' competence and knowledge. According to Pawley and Syder, a native speaker has a number of fully- or semi-lexicalized morpheme sequences in her long-term memory, in addition to a set of productive syntactic rules. When people engage in a conversation, there are a number of cognitively intensive tasks that they have to perform other than encording and decoding internal structure of each utterance, such as planning a larger unit of discourse, planning and interpreting perlocutionary effects, and paying attention to the surroundings. The use of pre-established expressions helps both the speaker and the addressee, since such expressions can be easily and quickly retrieved from their long-term memory, and little encoding and decoding work is required. As Pawley and Syder note, these memorized sequences have varying degrees of lexicalization. While some are completely fixed expressions, most others are \"stems\" that can be in-flected, expanded or transformed to some extent. 7.2 Analogical Translation This model of a native speaker's linguistic competence fits very well with the analogical framework of translation (Nagao, 1984), (Jones, 1996). In the analogical framework, the translation system is equipped with a large database of pre-translated example pairs, in which the best example that matches the input expression is selected and used for generating an appropriate target language expression. For translating spoken language, an analogical system should have various sentence stems and patterns along with their corresponding translation in its example database. In this framework, the task of an the spoken language translation system can be seen as follows: given the speech recognizer output, the system must recover the closest example available in the example database (Figure 3). 7.3 A Model of Speech Production There are a number of factors that need to be considered in trying to select the most appropriate example in the database for the given input. Based on four distinct factors that we have identified, we propose a model of spoken language production that we call the \"cascaded noisy channel model\" (Figure 4). In this model, the speaker first selects an example E that is closest to the core of the message that she intends to express. Then, the speaker modifies patterns by replacing subconstituents, by expanding it with modifiers, and by transforming it into different syntactic constructions (for example, transforming it from the declarative mood 4to the interrogative mood, or from the active voice to the passive voice). This process yields the \"intended propositional content\"~ Next, depending on the speech situation and discourse context, the speaker applies certain pragmatic utterance strategies. This results in the \"in-tended utterance\", which is characterized by natural speech properties such as ellipsis, inverted word order, or interjections.","When the speaker actually vocalizes the utterance, speech performance errors may occur. The result of this is the \"actual utterance\" that is presented to the listener. The speech recognition program converts the speech signal to a string of word hypotheses, possibly introducing additional errors and distortions, which results in the \"recognizer output\". 20"]},{"title":"Closest :Exampie i::. ::: ':","paragraphs":["Figure 4: Cascaded Noisy Channel Model of Spoken Language","Thus, the speech recognizer output, which represents the input to the translation engine, has traversed four distinct channels or distortion processes, each of which is associated with different causes and effects on the message. Previous research has shown that speech recognizer errors can bc modeled, and corrected, in such a framework (Ringger and Allen, 1996). In our work, we extend this model to cover a sequence of separate sources of distortions. 7.4 A Hybrid Analogical Method for","Speech Translation We have incorporated into the analogical translation method a shallow syntactic analysis module that identifies clause and phrase boundaries and that converts some variations into lexical and syntactic features. Both input and example expressions are matched after shallow syntactic analysis. Analogical matching and transfer is applied recursively to the input syntactic tree. By applying the recursivc analogical transfer process from larger linguistic constitucnts to subconstituents, the system can handle various degree of lexicalization in the input language in an efficient manner.","In our work, the distortion processes are modeled using a number of distortion operators that operate on the shallow syntactic tree of the utterance. Given a number of independence assumptions, the most probable example can be computed efficiently with a dynamic programming algorithm.

Thus, if we attempt a direct mapping of the pragmatic operators, we might obtain a translation similar to the following: (5) Sort of difficult, to reject something like that is","This translation is quite awkward, and does not fully reflect the pragmatic meaning of the original sentence. 8.6"]},{"title":"Translating Pragmatic Strategies","paragraphs":["By analyzing each operator for its pragmatic effect, we can obtain a translation that preserves the speaker's pragmatic intentions:","Well, it's sort of difficult, isn't it, to reject","something like that.

In order to accurately render the full range of meaning conveyed by such utterances, it is not sufficient to limit attention to syntactic and semantic aspects of spoken expressions.","Based on a number of independent motivations, we have adopted a hybrid analogical approach to the problem of translating spoken language. Briefly, our approach is motivated by the shortcomings that we perceive in other approaches, such as syntactic or semantic-grammar based, interlingua-based, purely analogical, or purely statistical methods. For more detailed arguments, please refer to (Horiguchi and Franz, 1997).","In this paper, we have described our view of spoken language pragmatics, and we have described how pragmatic information can be translated within the hybrid analogical approach. In future work, we will perform corpus analysis for additional pragmatic operators, and extend the prototype implementation of our analogical speech translation system to cover these phenomena.
