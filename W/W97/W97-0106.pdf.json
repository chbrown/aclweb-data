By grouping brackets in s corpus into a number of sire;far bracket groups based on their local contextual information, the corpus is automatically labeled with some nonterm~=a] labels, and consequently a grammar with conditional probabilities is acquired. The statistical parsing model provides a framework for finding the most likely parse of a sentence based on these conditional probabilities. Experiments using Wall Street Journal data show that our approach achieves a relatively high accuracy: 88 % recaJ1, 72 % precision and 0.7 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences shorter than 10 words, and 71 ~ recall, 51 ~0 precision and 3.4 crossing brackets for sentences between 10-19 words. This result supports the assumption that local contextual statistics obtained from an unlabeled bracketed corpus are effective for learnln~ a useful grammar and parsing."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Most natural language processing systems utilize grammars for parsing sentences in order to recognize their structure and finally to understand their meaning. Due to the ,l~mculty and complexity of constructing a grammar by hand, there were several approaches developed for a, uton~tically training grammars from a large corpus with some probabilistic models. These methods can be characterized by properties of the corpus they used, such as whether it includes information of brackets, lexical ]abels, nontermlnsl labels and so on.","Recently several parsed corpora which include full bracketing, tagging and nonterm~l labels have been available for researchers to use for constructing a probaMlistic grammar[Mag91, Bla92, Mag95, Co196]. Most researches on these grammars calcuLzte statistics of a grammar from a fully-parsed corpus with nonterm;nal lsbeis and apply them to rank the possible parses of a sentence. While these researches report some promising results, due to the cost of corpus construction, it still seems worth inferring a probabilistic grammar from corpora with less information, such as ones without bracketing and/or nonterm~al labels, and use it for parsing. Unlike the way to annotate bracketings for corpora by hand, the hand-annotation of nonterm~nal labels need a process that a corpus builder have to determine types of nonterm~nal labels and their number. This process is, in some senses, arbitrary and most of such corpora occupy a set of very coarse-grained nonterminsl labels. Moreover, compared with corpora including nonterm~sl labels, there are more existing corpora which include bracketings without nonterm~nal labels such as EDR corpus[EDR94] and ATIS spoken language corpns[Hem90]. The well-known standard method to infer a prohabilistic conte.xt-free grammar from a bracketed/unbracketed corpus without nonterminal labels is so-called 31"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["inside-outside algorithm which w~ originally proposed by Baker[Bak79] and was implemented as applications for speech and language in ~Lar90], [Per92] and [Sch93]. Although encouraging results were shown in these works, the derived grammars were restricted to Chomsky normal-form CFGs and there were problems of the small size of acceptable trai=~ng corpora and the relatively high computation time required for training the grandams.","Towards the problems, this paper proposes a new method which can learn a standard CFG with less computational cost by adopting techniques of clustering analysis to construct a context-sensitive probab'distic grammar from a bracketed corpus where nontermlnal labels are not an-notated. Another claim of this paper is that statistics from a large bracketed corpus without nonterminal labels combined with clustering techniques can help us construct a probabilistic grammar which produces an accurate natural language statistical parser. In this method, nonterminal labels for brackets in a bracketed corpus can be automatically assigned by making use of local contextual information which is defined as a set of category pairs of left and right words of a constituent in the phrase structure of a sentence. In this research, based on the assumption that not all contexts are useful in every case, effectiveness of contexts is also investigated. By using only effective contexts, it is possible for us to improve training speed and memory space without a sacrifice of accuracy. Finally, a statistical parsing model bawd on the acquired grammar is provided and the performance is shown through some experiments using the WSJ corpus."]},{"title":"I I I I I I 2 Grammar Acquisition as Clustering Process I","paragraphs":["In the past, Theeramunkong[The96] proposed a method of grouping brackets in a bracketed corpus (with lexical tags but no nonterminal labels), according to their local contextual information, as a first step towards the automatic acquisition of a context-free grammar. The basic idea is to apply clustering analysis to find out a number of groups of s;m;]ar brackets in the corpus and then to ~sign each group with a same nonterminal label. Clustering analysis is a generic name of a variety of mathematical methods that can be used to find out which objects in a set are s;mi]sr. Its applications on natural language processing are varied such as in areas of word classification, text categorization and so on [Per93][Iwa95]. However, there is still few researches which apply clustering analysis for grammar inference and parsing~Vior95]. This section gives an explanation of grammar acquisition based on clustering analysis. In the first place, let us consider the following example of the parse strnctures of two sentences in the corpus in figure 1.","In the parse structures, leaf nodes are given tags while there is no label for intermedLzte nodes. Note that each node corresponds to a bracket in the corpus. With this corpus, the grammar learning task corresponds to a process to determ~=e the label for each intermediate node. In other words, this task is concerned with the way to cluster the brackets into some certain groups based on their similarity and give each group a label. For instance, in figure 1, it is reasonable to classify the brackets (c2),(c4) and (c5) into a same group and give them a same label (e.g., NP(noun phrase)). As the result, we obtain three grammar rules: NP ~ (DT)(NN), NP ~ (PR.P$)(NN) and NP ~ (DT)(cl). To do this, the grammar acquisition algorithm operates in five steps as follows."]},{"title":"I I I I I I","paragraphs":["1.

Its application on natural language processing was firstly proposed by Harris[Hat51] and was shown successfully for detecting phrase structures in [Bri92][Per93]. Basically, divergence, as well as relative entropy, is not exactly s'nnilarity measure instead it indicates distributional dissimilarity.

In each iterative step of the merging process, differential entropies are calculated. During the merging process, there are some sharp pealr~ indicating the rapid fluctuation of entropy.

The parser is constructed by using decision-tree learning techniques and can succeed up to 86-90 % of bracketing accuracy(both recall and precision) when tr~ing with the WSJ corpus, a fully-parsed corpus with nontermlnvJ labels. Later Collins[Col96] introduced a statistical parser which is based on probabilities of bigzam dependencies between head-words in a parse tree. At least the same accuracy as SPATTER was acquired for this parser. These two methods ufflized a corpus which includes both lexical categories and nontermi~al categories. However, it seems a hard task to assign nontermlnsl labels for a corpus and the way to assign a nonterminal label to each constituent in the parsed sentence is arduous and arbitrary. It follows that it is worth trying to infer a grammar from corpora without nontermlnal labels.","One of the most promising results of grammar inference based on grammar-based approaches is the inside-outside algorithm proposed by Laxi[Lazg0] to construct the gr~.mmax from unbracketed corpus. This algorithm is an extension of forward-backward algorithm which infers the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar. In this research the acquired grammar is elr~.luated based on its entropy or perplexity where the accuracy of parsing is not taken into account. As another research, Pereira and Schabes[Per921[Sch93 ] proposed a modified method to infer a stochastic gran~ar from a partially parsed corpus and evaluated the results with a bracketed corpus. This approach gained up to around 90 % bracketing recall for short sentences(0-15 words) but it sut~ered with a large amount ambiguity for long ones(20-30) where 70 % recall is gained. The acquired gr~mrn~T is normally in Chomsky .normal-form which is a special case of gr~mTnar although he claimed that all of CFGs can be in this form. This type of the gr=tmrnar makes all output parses of this method be in the form of binary-branrMng trees and then the bracketing precision cannot be taken into account because correct parses in the corpus need not be in this form. On the other hand, our proposed approach can learn a standard CFG with 88 % recall for short sentences and 60 % recall for long ones. This result shows that our method gets the same level of accuracy as the inside-outside algorithm does. However, our approach can learn a gr~tmm~.~, which is not restricted to Chomsky normal-form and performs with leas computational cost compared with the approaches applying the inside-outside algorithm."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a method of applying clustering aaalysis to learn a context-sensitive probab'flistic grammar from an unlabeled bracketed corpus. Supported by some experiments, local contextual information which is left and right categories of a constituent was shown to be useful for acquiring a context-sensitive conditional probability context-free grammar from a corpus. A probabilistic parsing model using the acquired grammar was described and its potential was eT~m{ned. Through experiments, our parser can achieve high paxsing accuracy to some extent compared with other previous approaches with less computational cost. As our further work, there 39 are still many possibilities for improvement which are encouraging. For instance, it is possible to use lexical information and head information in clustering and constructing a probabilistic g~l~Yn Tn ~LY."]},{"title":"References [Aga95] [Bak79] ~ar95]","paragraphs":["[Bla91] [B1a92]"]},{"title":"p3~2] [Co196] [EDR94] p~=51] p~em90] ~w~51 ~0] ~ag911 ~o~5] ~er92]","paragraphs":["[Per931"]},{"title":"[Sch931 [Sw~9] [The96]","paragraphs":["Agarwal, 1~.: Evaluation of Semantic Clusters, in"]},{"title":"Proceeding off $$rd Annual Meeting off the ACL,","paragraphs":["pp. 284-286, 1995.
