Our approach enlists both short-range and long-range language models to help it sniff out likely sites of topic changes in text. To aid its search, the system consults a set of simple lexical hints it has learned to associate with the presence of boundaries through inspection of a large corpus of annotated data. We also propose a new probabilistically motivated error metric for use by the natural language processing and information retrieval communities, intended to supersede precision and recall for appraising segmentation algorithms. Qualitative assessment of our algorithm as well as evaluation using this new metric demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two very different domains, Wall Street Journal articles and the TDT Corpus, a collection of newswire articles and broadcast news transcripts. 1 Introduction The task we address in this paper might seem on the face of it rather elementary: identify where one region of text ends and another begins. This work was motivated by the observations that such a seemingly simple problem can actually prove quite difficult to automate, and that a tool for partitioning a stream of undifferentiated text (or multimedia) into coherent regions would be of great benefit to a number of existing applications.","The task itself is ill-defined: what exactly is meant by a \"region\" of text? We confront this issue by","*Research supported in part by NSF grant IRI-9314969, DARPA AASERT award DAAH04-95-1-0475, and the ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories. adopting an empirical definition of segment. At our disposal is a collection of online data (38 million words of Wall Street Journal archives and another 150 million words from selected news broadcasts) annotated with the boundaries between regions-- articles or news reports, respectively. Given this input, the task of constructing a segmenter may be cast as a problem in machine learning: glean from the data a set of hints about where boundaries occur, and use these hints to inform a decision on where to place breaks in unsegmented data.","A general-purpose tool for partitioning expository text or multimedia data into coherent regions would have a number of immediate practical uses. In fact, this research was inspired by a problem in information retrieval: given a large unpartitioned collection of expository text and a user's query, return a collection of coherent segments matching the query. Lacking a segmenting tool, an II:t application may be able to locate positions in its database which are strong matches with the user's query, but be unable to de-termine how much of the surrounding data to provide to the user. This can manifest itself in quite unfortunate ways. For example, a video-on-demand application (such as the one described in (Christel et al., 1995)) responding to a query about a recent news event may provide the user with a news clip related to the event, followed or preceded by part of an unrelated story or even a commercial.","Document summarization is another fertile area for an automatic segmenter. Summarization tools often work by breaking the input into \"topics\" and then summarizing each topic independently. A segmentation tool has obvious applications to the first of these tasks.","The output of a segmenter could also serve as input to various language-modeling tools. For in-stance, one could envision segmenting a corpus, classifying the segments by topic, and then constructing topic-dependent language models from the generated classes.","The paper will proceed as follows. In Section 2 we"]},{"title":"35","paragraphs":["very briefly review some previous approaches to the text segmentation problem. In Section 3 we describe our model, including the type of linguistic clues it looks for in deciding when placing a partition is appropriate. In Section 4 we describe a feature induction algorithm that automatically constructs a set of the most informative clues. Section 5 shows examples of the feature induction algorithm in action. In Section 6 we introduce a new, probabilistically motivated way to evaluate a text segmenter. Finally, in Section 7 we demonstrate our model's effectiveness on two distinct domains."]},{"title":"2 Some Previous Work","paragraphs":["In this section we very briefly discuss some previous approaches to the text segmentation problem. 2.1 Text tiling The Te~ctTiling algorithm, introduced by Hearst (Hearst, 1994), segments expository texts into multiple paragraphs of coherent discourse units. A cosine measure is used to gauge the similarity between constant-size blocks of morphologically analyzed to-kens. First-order rates of change of this measure are then calculated to decide the placement of boundaries between blocks, which are then adjusted to coincide with the paragraph segmentation, provided as input to the algorithm. This approach leverages the observation that text segments are dense with repeated content words. Relying on this fact, how-ever, may limit precision because the repetition of concepts within a document is more subtle than can be recognized by only a \"bag of words\" tokenizer and morphological filter.","Word pairs other than \"self-triggers,\" for example, can be discovered automatically from training data using the techniques of mutual information employed by our language model. Furthermore, Hearst's approach segments at the paragraph level, which may be too coarse for applications like information retrieval on transcribed or automatically recognized spoken documents, in which paragraph boundaries are not known. 2.2 Lexical cohesion (Kozima, 1993) employs a \"lexical cohesion profile\" to keep track of the semantic cohesiveness of words in a text within a fixed-length window. In contrast to Hearst's focus on strict repetition, Kozima uses a semantic network to provide knowledge about related word pairs. Lexical cohesiveness between two words is calculated in the network by \"activating\" the node for one word and observing the \"activity value\" at the other word after some number of iterations of \"spreading activation\" between nodes. The network is trained automatically using a language-specific knowledge source (a dictionary of definitions). Kozima generalizes lexical cohesiveness to apply to a window of text, and plots the cohesiveness of successive text windows in a document, identifying the valleys in the measure as segment boundaries.","A graphically motivated segmentation technique called dotplotting is offered in (Reynar, 1994). This technique uses a simplified notion of lexical cohesion, depending exclusively on word repetition to find tight regions of topic similarity. 2.3 Decision trees (Litman and Passonneau, 1995) presents an algorithm that uses decision trees to combine multiple linguistic features extracted from corpora of spoken text, including prosodic and lexical cues. The decision tree algorithm, like ours, chooses from a space of candidate features, some of which are similar to our vocabulary questions. The set of candidate questions in Litman and Passonneu's approach, however, is lacking in features related to \"lexical cohesion.\" In our work we incorporate such features by using a pair of language models, as described below."]},{"title":"3 A Feature-Based Approach","paragraphs":["Our attack on the segmentation problem is based on a statistical framework that we call feature induction for random fields and exponential models (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra, 1996; Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty, 1997). The idea is to construct a model which assigns to each position in the data stream a probability that a boundary be-longs at that position. This probability distribution arises by incrementally building a log-linear model that weighs different \"features\" of the data. For simplicity, we assume that the features are binary questions.","To illustrate (and to show that our approach is in no way restricted to text), consider the task of partitioning a stream of multimedia data containing audio, text and video. In this setting, the features might include questions such as: Â• Does the phrase COMING UP appear in the last utterance of the decoded speech? Â• Is there a sharp change in the video stream in the last 20 frames? Â• Does the language model degrade in performance in","the next two utterances? Â• Is there a \"match\" between the spectrum of the","current image and an image near the last segment","boundary?","Â• Are there blank video frames nearby? Â• Is there a sharp change in the audio stream in the","next utterance?"]},{"title":"36","paragraphs":["The idea of using features is a natural one, and indeed other recent work on segmentation, such as (Litman and Passonneau, 1995), adopts this approach. We take a unique approach to incorporat-ing the information inherent in various features, using the statistical framework of exponential models to choose the best features and combine them in a principled manner. 3.1 A short-range model of language Central to our approach to segmenting is a pair of tools: a short- and long-range model of language. Monitoring the relative behavior of these two models goes a long way towards helping our segmenter sniff out natural breaks in the text. In this section and the next, we describe these language models and explain their utility in identifying segments.","The trigram models Ptri(W ]w-2, W-l) we employ use the Katz backoff scheme (Katz, 19877) for smoothing. We trained trigram models on two different corpora. The Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) is a 38-million word corpus of articles from the news-paper. The model was constructed using a set },V of the approximately 20,000 most frequently occurring words in the corpus. Another model was constructed on the Broadcast News corpus (BN), made up of approximately 150 million words (four and a half years) of transcripts of various news broadcasts, including CNN news, political roundtables, NPR broadcasts, and interviews.","By restricting the conditioning information to the previous two words, the trigram model is making the simplifying assumption--clearly false--that the use of language one finds in television, radio, and news-paper can be modeled by a second-order Markov process. Although words prior to w-2 certainly bear on the identity of w, higher-order models are impractical: the number of parameters in an n-gram model is O([ W ]~), and finding the resources to compute and store all these parameters becomes a hopeless task for n > 3. Usually the lexical myopia of the trigram model is a hindrance; however, we will see how a segmenter can in fact make positive use of this shortsightedness. 3.2 A long-range model of language One of the fundamental characteristics of language, viewed as a stochastic process, is that it is highly"]},{"title":"nonstationary.","paragraphs":["Throughout a written document and during the course of spoken'conversation, the topic evolves, affecting local statistics on word occurrences. A model which could adapt to its recent context would seem to offer much over a stationary model such as the trigram model. For example, an adaptive model might, for some period of time after seeing a word like HOMERUN, boost the probabilities of the words {HOMERUN, PITCHER, FIELDER, ERROR, BATTER, TRIPLE, OUT}. For an empiricallydriven example, we provide an excerpt from the BN corpus. Emphasized words mark where a long-range language model might reasonably be expected to outperform (assign higher probabilities than) a short-range model: Some doctors are more skilled at doing the procedure than others so it's recommended that patients ask doctors about their track record. People at high risk of stroke include those over age 55 with a family history or high blood pressure, diabetes and smokers. We urge them to be evaluated by their family physicians and this can be done by a very simple procedure simply by having them test with a stethoscope for symptoms of blockage.","One means of injecting long-range awareness into a language model is by retaining a cache of the most recently seen n-grams which is smoothed together (typically by linear interpolation) with the static model; see for example (Jelinek et al., 1991; Kuhn and de Mori, 1990).

Consulting Table 1, we see that in the BN corpus, the presence of VLADIMIR will boost the probability of GENNADY by a factor of 19.6 for the next N = 500 words. 3.3 Language model \"relevance\" features A long-range language model such as that described in Section 3.2 uses selected words from the past ten, twenty or more sentences to inform its decision on the possible identity of the next word. This is likely to help if all of these sentences are in the same document as the current word, for in that case the model has presumably begun to adapt to the idiosyncracies of the current document. In the case of the trigger model described above, the cache will be filled with \"relevant\" words. In this setting, one would expect a long-range model to outperform a trigram (or other short-range) model, which doesn't avail itself of long-range information.","On the other hand, if the present document has just recently begun, the long-range model is wrongly conditioning its decision on information from a different--and presumably unrelated--document. A soap commercial, for instance, doesn't benefit a long-range model in assigning probabilities to the words in the news segment following the commercial. Often a long-range model will actually be misled by such irrelevant context; in this case, the myopia of the trigram model is actually helpful.","By monitoring the long- and short-range models, one might be more inclined towards a partition when the long-range model suddenly shows a dip in performance--a lower assigned probability to the observed words--compared to the short-range model. Conversely, when the long-range model is consistently assigning higher probabilities to the observed words, a partition is less likely.","This motivates a quantitative measure of \"relevance,\" which we define as the logarithm of the ratio of the probability the exponential model assigns to the next word (or sentence) to that assigned by the short-range trigram model:"]},{"title":"a(H,w)=-log( Pexp(wlH)","paragraphs":["~kPtri(W I W-2W-1)J \" When the exponential model outperforms the trigram model, R > 0."]},{"title":"38","paragraphs":["If we observe the behavior of R as a function of the position of the word within a segment, we find that on average R slowly increases from below zero to well above zero. Figure 1 gives a striking graphical illustration of this phenomenon. The figure plots the average value of R as a function of relative position in the segment, with position zero indicating the beginning of a segment. This plot shows that when a segment boundary is crossed the predictions of the adaptive model undergo a dramatic and sudden degradation, and then steadily become more accurate as relevant content words for the new segment are encountered and added to the cache. (The few very high points to the left of a segment boundary are primarily a consequence of the word CNN--which is a trigger word and often appears at the beginning and end of a broadcast news segment.)","This observed behavior is consistent with our earlier intuition: the cache of the long-range model is destructive early in a document, when the new content words bear little in common with the content words from the previous article. Gradually, as the cache fills with words drawn from the current article, the long-range model gains steam and R improves. While Figure 1 shows that this behavior is very pronounced as a \"law of large numbers,\" our feature induction results indicate that relevance is also a very good predictor of boundaries for individual events.","In the experiments we report in this paper, we assume that sentence boundaries are provided in the annotation, and so the questions we ask are actually about the relevance score assigned to entire sentences normalized by sentence length, a geometric mean of language model ratios. 3.4 Vocabulary features In addition to the estimate of \"topicality\" that relevance features provide, we included features pertain-ing to the identity of words before and after potential segment boundaries as candidates in our exponential model.

In this manner, an exponential model is incrementally built up using the most informative features.","Having concluded our discussion of our overall approach, we present in Figure 2 a schematic view of the steps involved in building a segmenter using this approach.

We emphasize that the process of feature selection is completely automatic once the set of candidate features has been selected.","The first segmenter was built on the WSJ corpus. The second was built on the Topic Detection and Tracking Corpus (Allan, to appear). The TDT corpus is a mixed collection of newswire articles and broadcast news transcripts adapted from text corpora previously released by the Linguistic Data Consortium; in particular, portions of data were extracted from the 1995 and 1996 Language Model text collections published by the LDC in support of the DARPA Continuous Speech Recognition project. The extracts used for TDT include material from the Reuters newswire service, and from the Primary Source Media CD-ROM publications of transcripts for news programs that appeared on the ABC, CNN, NPR and PBS broadcast networks; the size of the corpus is roughly 7.5 million words. The TDT corpus was constructed as part of a DARPA-sponsored project intended to study methods for detecting new topics or events and tracking their reappearance and evolution over time. 5.1 WSJ features For the WSJ experiments, which we describe first, a total of 300,000 candidate features were available to the induction program. Though the trigram prior was trained on 38 million words, the trigger parameters were only trained on a one million word subset of this data.","Figure 3 shows the first several features that were selected by the feature induction algorithm.

The first selected feature, for instance, is a strong hint that an article may have just begun; articles in the WSJ corpus often concern companies, and typically the full name of the company (ACME INCORPORATED, for instance) only appears once at the beginning of the article, and subsequently in abbreviated form (ACME). Thus the appearance of INCORPORATED is a strong indication that a new article may have recently begun.","The second feature uses the relevance statistic t.","1 For the WSJ experiments, we modified the language model relevance statistic by adding a weight to each word position depending only on its trigram history w-2, w-1. Although our results require further analysis, we do not believe that this makes a significant difference in the fea-If the trigger model performs poorly relative to the trigram model in the following sentence, this feature (roughly speaking) boosts the probability of a segment at this location by a factor of 5.3.","The fifth feature concerns the presence of the word MR. In hindsight, we can explain this feature by noting that in WSJ data the style is to introduce a person in the beginning of an article by writing, for example, WILE E. COYOTE, PRESIDENT OF ACME INCORPORATED... and then later in the article using a shortened form of the name: MR. COYOTE CITED A LACK OF EXPLOSIVES... Thus, the presence of MR. in the following sentence discounts the probability of an article boundary by 0.07, a factor of roughly 14.","The sixth feature which boosts the probability of a segment if the previous sentence contained the word CLOSED--is another artifact of the WSJ domain, where articles often end with a statement of a company's performance on the stock market during the day of the story of interest. Similarly, the end of an article is often made with an invitation to visit a related story; hence a sentence beginning with SEE boosts the probability of a segment boundary by a large factor of 94.8. Since a personal pronoun typically requires an antecedent, the presence of HE among the first words is a sign that the current position is not near an article boundary, and this feature therefore has a discounting factor of 0.082. 5.2 TDT features For the TDT experiments, a larger vocabulary and roughly 800,000 candidate features were available to the induction program. Though the trigram prior was trained on approximately 150 million words, the trigger parameters were trained on a 10 million word subset of the BN corpus.","Figure 4 reveals the first several features chosen by the induction algorithm. The letter c. appears among several of the first features. This is because of the fact that the data is tokenized for speech processing (whence c. N. N. rather than CNN), and the network identification information is often given at the end and beginning of news segments (c. N. N.'S RICHARD BLYSTONE IS HERE TO TELL US...). The first feature asks if the letter c. appears in the previous five words; if so, the probability of a segment boundary is boosted by a factor of 9.0.

(Reynar, 1994) uses an error window that redefines \"correct\" to mean hypothesized within some constant window of units away from a reference boundary, but this approach still suffers from overdiscretizing error, drawing all-or-nothing lines insensitive to gradations of correctness.","Finally, for many purposes it is useful to have a metric that is a single number. A commonly cited flaw of the precision/recall figures is their complementary nature: hypothesizing more boundaries raises precision at the expense of recall, allowing an algorithm designer to tweak parameters to trade precision for recall. One proposed work-around is to employ dynamic time warping to come up with an explicit alignment between the segments proposed by the algorithm and the reference segments, and then to combine insertion, deletion, and substitution errors into an overall penalty. This error metric, in common use in speech recognition, can be achieved by a similar Viterbi search. A string edit distance such as this is useful and reasonable for applications like speech or spelling correction partly because it measures how much work a user would have to do to correct the output of the machine. For many of the applications we envision for segmentation, however, the user will not correct the output but will rather browse the returned text to extract information.","Our proposed metric satisfies the listed desiderata. It formalizes in a probabilistic manner the effect of document co-occurrence on goodness, in which it is deemed desirable for related units of information to appear in the same document and unrelated units to appear in separate documents. 6.1 The new metric Segmentation, whether at the word or sentence level, is about identifying boundaries between successive units of information in a text corpus. Two such units are either related or unrelated by the intent of the document author. A natural way to reason about developing a segmentation algorithm is therefore to optimize the likelihood that two such units are correctly labeled as being related or being unrelated. Our error metric P~, is simply the probability that two sentences drawn randomly from the corpus are correctly identified as belonging to the same document or not belonging to the same document. More formally, given two segmentations ref and hyp for a corpus n sentences long,","P,(ref,hyp) = ~ D~(i,j) Sref(i,j) ~$hyp(i,j) l<i<j<n Here ~ref is an indicator function which is 1 if the two corpus indices specified by its parameters belong in the same document, and 0 otherwise; similarly, ~hyp is 1 if the two indices are hypothesized to belong in the same document, and 0 otherwise. The","operator is the XNOR function (\"both or neither\") on its two operands. The function D, is a distance probability distribution over the set of possible distances between sentences chosen randomly from the corpus, and will in general depend on certain parameters # such as the average spacing between sentences. If D~ is uniform over the length of the text, then the metric represents the probability that any two sentences drawn from the corpus are correctly identified as being in the same document or not.","Consider the implications of this for information retrieval. Suppose there is precisely one sentence in a target corpus that satisfies our information demands. For some applications it may be sufficient for the system to return only that sentence, but in general we desire that it return as many sentences directly related to the target sentence as possible, without returning too many unrelated sentences. If we assume \"related\" to mean \"contained in the same document\", then our error metric judges algorithms based on how often this happens.","In practice letting D~, be the uniform distribution is unreasonable, since for large corpora most randomly drawn pairs of sentences are in different documents and are correctly identified as such by even the most naive algorithms. We instead adopt a distribution that focuses on small distances. In particular, we choose D~ to be an exponential distribution with mean l/p, a parameter that we fix at the approximate mean document length for the domain: Dt~(i, J) = 7t~ e-~li-jl . In the above, 7t, is a normalization chosen so that D~, is a probability distribution over the range of distances it can accept.","There are several sanity checks that validate the use of our metric. The measure is a probability and therefore a real number between 0 and 1. We expect 1 to represent perfection; indeed, an algorithm scores 1 with respect to some data if and only if it predicts its segmentation exactly. It captures the notion of nearness in a principled way, gently penalizing algorithms that hypothesize boundaries that aren't quite right, and scaling down with the algorithm's degradation. Furthermore, it is not possible to \"cheat\" and obtain a high score with this metric: spurious behavior such as never hypothesizing boundaries and hypothesizing nothing but boundaries are penalized. We refer to Section 7 for sample results on how these trivial algorithms score.","One weakness of the metric as we have presented it here is that there is no principled way of specify-ing the distance distribution Du. We plan to give a more detailed analysis of this problem and present a method for choosing the parameters ~ in a future paper. 7 Experimental Results 7.1 Quantitative results","After feature induction was carried out (as described in Section 5), a simple decision procedure was used for actually placing boundaries: a segment boundary was placed at each position for which the model probability was above a fixed threshold or, with boundaries required to be separated by a minimum number of sentences e. The threshold and minimum separation were determined on heldout data in order to maximize the probability P~, and turned out to be a = 0.20 and e = 2 for the WSJ model, and ot = 0.14 and e = 5 for the TDT models.","The quantiative results for the WSJ and TDT models are collected in Tables 5 and 6 respectively. For the WSJ model, the probabilistic metric P~, was 0.83 when evaluated on 325K words of test data, and the precision and recall for exact matches of boundaries were 56% and 54%, for an F-measure of 55. As a simple baseline we compared this performance to that obtained by four simple default methods for assigning boundaries: choosing boundaries randomly, assigning every possible boundary, 43"]},{"title":"model feature induction","paragraphs":["random all"]},{"title":"reference hypoth. segments segments P~ precision","paragraphs":["757 792 83% 56% 757 757 67% 17% 757 13540 53% 5% none 757 0 52% 0% even 757 753 68% 17%"]},{"title":"recall F.measure","paragraphs":["54% 55 16% 17 100% 10 0% 17% 17 Table 5: Quantitative results for WSJ segmentation.

It is instructive to compare the values of P, with precision and recall for these default algorithms in order to obtain some intuition for the new error metric.","Two separate models were built to segment the TDT corpus. The first, which we shall refer to simply as Model A, was trained using two million words from the BN corpus from the 1992-1993 time period. This data contains CNN transcripts, but no Reuters newswire data. Model B was trained on the first two million words of the TDT corpus. Both models were tested on the last 4.3 million words of the TDT corpus. We expect Model A to be inferior to Model B for two reasons: the lack of Reuters data in it's training set and the difference of between one and two years in the dates of the stories in the 44 training and test sets. The difference is quantifiied in Table 6, which shows that P~, = 0.82 for Model A while P, = 0.88 for Model B. 7.2 Qualitative results","We now present graphical examples of the segmentation algorithm at work on previously unseen test data.

Unlike many other machine learning methods, feature induction for exponential models is quite robust to overfitting since the features act in concert to assign probability to events rather than splitting the event space and assigning probability using relative counts. We expect that significantly better results can be obtained by simply training on much more data, and by allowing a more sophisticated set of features. 45"]},{"title":"8 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have presented and evaluated a new statistical model for segmenting unpartitioned text into coherent fragments. We leverage long- and short-range language models, as well as automatic feature induction techniques, in the design of this model. In this work we rely exclusively on simple lexical features, including a topicality measure called relevance and a number of vocabulary features that are induced from a large space of candidate features.","We have proposed a new probabilistically motivated error metric for the assessment of segmentation algorithms. Qualitative assessment as well as the evaluation of our algorithm with this new metric demonstrates its effectiveness in two very different domains, Wall Street Journal articles and broadcast news transcripts.","Our immediate application of this model will be to the video-on-demand application called Informedia (Christel et al., 1995). We intend to mix simple audio and video features such as statistics from pauses, black frames, and color histograms with our lexical features in order to segment news broadcasts into component stories. Other applications that we have not explored in this paper include automatic infer-ence of subtopic structure for information retrieval, document summarization, and improved language modeling."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Michael Witbrock and Alex Hauptmann for discussions on the segmentation problem within the context of the Inforrnedia project.
