Furthermore, SCFGs can be automatically estimated using the Inside-Outside algorithm, which is guaranteed to produce a SCFG that is (locally) optimal (Baker, 1990). Hence, SCFGs appear to be suitable formalisms for the estimation of widecovering grammars, capable of being used as part of a system that assigns logical forms to sentences.","Unfortunately, from a Natural Language Process-ing perspective, SCFGs are not appropriate grammars to learn. Firstly, as Collins demonstrates (Collins, 1996), accurate parse selection, which is important for ambiguity resolution, requires lexical statistics. SCFGs, as standardly used in the Inside-Outside algorithm, are in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which restricts rules to being at most binary branching. Such rules are not lexicalised, and hence, to lexicalise (CNF) CFGs requires adding a complex statistical model that simulates the projection of head items up the parse tree. Given the embryonic status of grammatical statistical models and the difficulties of accurately estimating the parameters of such a model, it seems more prudent to prefer whenever possible simpler statistical models with fewer parameters, and treat lexicalisation as part of the grammatical formalism, and not as part of the statistical framework (for example (Schabes, 1992)). Secondly, (stochastic) CFGs are well-known as being linguistically inadequate formalisms for problems such as non-constituent coordination. Hence, a learner using a SCFG will not have an appropriate formalism with which to construct an adequate grammar.","Stochastic categorial grammars (SCGs), which are classical categorial grammars extended with a probabilistic component, by contrast, have a grammatical component that is naturally lexicalised. Furthermore, Combinatory Categorial Grammars have been shown to account elegantly for problematic areas of syntax such as non-constituent co-ordination (Steedman, 1989), and so it seems likely that SCGs, when suitably extended, will be able to inherit this linguistic adequacy. We therefore believe that SCGs are more useful formalisms for statistical language learning than SCFGs. Future work will reinforce the differences between SCFGs and SCGS, but in this paper, we instead concentrate upon the estimation of SCGs.","Stochastic grammars (of all varieties) are usually estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Principle, which assumes an indifferent prior probability distribution. When there is sufficient training material, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) produces good results. More usually however, with many thousands of parameters to estimate, there will be insufficient training material for MLE to produce an optimal solution. If, instead, an informative prior is used in place of the indifferent prior, better results can be achieved. In this paper we show how using an informative prior probability distribution Osborne 8~ Briscoe 80 Stochastic Categorial Grammars Miles Osborne and Ted Briscoe (1997) Learning Stochastic Categorial Grammars. In T.M. Ellison (ed.) CoNLL97: Computational Natural Language Learning, ACL pp 80-87. (~) 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics leads to the estimation of a SCG that is more accurate than a SCG estimated using an indifferent prior. We use the Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL) as the basis of our informative prior. To our knowledge, we know of no other papers comparing MDL to MLE using naturally occurring data and learning probabilistic grammars. For example, Stolcke's MDL-based learner was trained using artificial data (Stolcke, 1984); Chen's similar learner mixes smoothing techniques with MDL, thereby obfuscat-ing the difference between MDL and MLE (Chen, 1996).","The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we introduce SCGs. We then in section 3 present a problem facing most statistical learners known as over]itting. Section 4 gives an overview of the MDL principle, which we use to deal with overfitting1; in section 5 we present our learner. Following this, in section 6 we give some experiments comparing use of MDL, with a MLE-style learner. The paper ends with some brief comments.","2 Grammar formalism and statistical models An SCG is a classical categorial grammar (one using just functional application, see, for example, Wood (Wood, 1993)) such that each category is augmented with a probability, which is used to model the choices made when constructing a parse. Categories are conditioned on the lexical item they are assigned to.","More formally, a categorial lexicon G is the tuple (A, C, V, L), where: Â• A is a non-empty set of atomic categories. Â• C is a non-empty set of complex categories. Â• V is a non-empty set of lexical items (words).","Â• L is the function L: Vv E V ~-~ 2 c. That is, L assigns sets of categories to lexical items. Complex categories are defined as follows: Â• Any member of A is a complex category. Â• If a and b are complex categories, then so is a\\b. * If a and b are complex categories, then so is a/b. Â• Nothing else is a complex category.","1A fuller discussion of MDL and statistical language learning can be found in (Rissanen and Ristad, 1994, de Marcken, 1996). A categorial grammar consists of a categorial lexicon augmented with the rule of left functional application: a b\\a ~ b and the rule of right functional application: b/a a ~-+ b.","A probabilistic categorial grammar is a categorial grammar such that the sum of the probabilities of all derivations is one. Since in our variant of a categorial grammar, where there are no variables in categories, directional information is encoded into each category, and we only use functional application, the actual derivation of any sentence mechanically follows from the assignment of categories to lexical items, and so it follows that the choices available when parsing with a categorial grammar arise from the particular assignment of categories to any given lexical item. Within a stochastic process, probabilities model these choices, so in a stochastic categorial grammar, we need to ensure that the probabilities of all categories assigned to a particular lexical item sum to one. That is, for all categories c in lexicon C assigned to lexical item w:"]},{"title":"E P(c [ w) =","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":"(1) cEC","paragraphs":["We estimate P(c ] w) as being:"]},{"title":"f(c) P(c I w) E ev (l)","paragraphs":["for some distinct Category c, occurring with frequency f(c), that can be assigned to lexical item w, and for all categories x, with frequency f(x), that can also be assigned to w.","For the derivation space to actually sum to one, all possible assignments of categories to lexical items must be legal. Clearly, only assignments of lexical items that combine to form a valid parse constitute legal category assignments, and so there will be a probability loss. That is, the sum of all derivations will be less than, or equal to one. We can either scale the probabilities so that the derivations do sum to one, or alternatively, we can assume that (illegal) assignments of categories are never seen, with the relative probabilities between the legal category assignments being unaffected, and so give a zero probability to the illegal category assignments 2","Because categories are normalised with respect to the lexical item they are associated with, the resulting statistical model is lexicalised. However, in this paper, we learn lexica of part-of-speech tag sequences, and not lexica for actual words. That is, the set of simple categories is taken as being a part-of-speech tag set and the set of words is Mso a set of 2Thanks to Eirik Hektoen for pointing this point out.

If the prior is accurate, hypotheses that are closer to the target hypothesis will have a higher prior probability assigned to them than hypotheses that are further away from the target hypothesis. The likelihood probability describes how well the training material can be encoded in the hypothesis. For example, one would hope that the training corpus would receive a high likelihood probability, but a set of ungrammatical sentences would receive a low likelihood probability. Finally, the posterior probability can be considered to be the combination of these two probability distributions: we prefer hypotheses that accord with our prior belief in them (have a high prior probability) and model the training material well (have a high likelihood probability). When learning in a Bayesian framework, we try to find some hypothesis that maximises the posterior probability.

Examples of the first approach can be seen most clearly with the usage of CNF grammars by the Inside-Outside algorithm (Pereira and Schabes, 1992, Lari and Young, 1990). A grammar in CNF does not contain rules of an arbitrary arity, and so when learning CNF grammars, the Inside-Outside algorithm cannot find the maximal likelihood estimation of some training set. The problem with this language restriction is that there is no a priori reason why one should settle with any particular limit on rule arity; some grammars mainly contain binary rules, but others (for example those implicitly within tree-banks) sometimes contain rules with many right-hand side categories. Any language restriction, in lieu of some theory of rule arity, must remain ad hoc. Note that SCGs, whilst assigning binary branching trees to sentences, contain categories that may naturally be of an arbitrary length, without violating linguistic intuitions about what constitutes a plausible analysis of some sentence.","Examples of the second approach can be found in language modelling (for example (Church and Gale, 1991, Katz, 1987)). Smoothing a probability distribution tends to make it 'closer' (reduces the Kullback-Liebler distance) to some other probability distribution (for example, the uniform distribution). Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that this other distribution is closer to the target probability distribution than was the original, un-smoothed distribution, and so smoothing cannot be relied upon always to improve upon the un-smoothed theory. Smoothing is also a post-hoc operation, unmotivated by de-tails of what is actually being learnt, or with properties (problems) of the estimation process. Instead of selecting some language restriction or resorting to smoothing, a better solution to the over-fitting problem would be to use an"]},{"title":"informative","paragraphs":["prior.

One way of finding a good hypothesis is to use a prior that favours hypotheses that are consistent with the training data, but have minimal complexity. That is, the prior should be construed in terms of how well the hypothesis can be compressed (since significant compression is equivalent to a low stochastic complexity).","We can compress the hypothesis by replacing it with code words, such that when measured in bits of information, the total length of the encoding is less than, or equal to, the length of the hypothesis, also when measured in bits.

We conceptually use a two-part, dictionary-based coding scheme: one part for word-category pairs with their associated code words, and another part for an encoding of the trees in terms of the code words. Since the total length of the encoding of the trees will be much larger than the total length of the word-category pairs and associated code words, we can assume the dictionary length is just a constant, smaller than the total length of the encoded parse trees, and just consider, without an undue loss in accuracy, the cost of transmitting the trees. Hence, when we evaluate various lexica, we determine how much it costs to transmit the training material in terms of the particular dictionary-based encoding of the lexicon in question. Equation 5 is used to give the length, in bits, of the code word we would assign to each category in a parse tree.","Our encoding scheme treats each category as being independent and clearly, we could have used more of the context within the parse trees to construct a more efficient encoding scheme (see, for example (Ristad and Thomas, 1995)).

This compares unlabelled, manually produced parses with automatically produced parses in terms of recall (the ratio of matched brackets over all brackets in the manually produced parses), precision (the ratio of matched brackets in the manually produced parse over all brackets found by the parser) and crossing rates (the number of times a bracketed sequence produced by the parser overlaps with one in the manually produced parse, but neither is properly contained in the other). The higher the precision and recall, and the lower the crossing rates, the better the grammar.","Throughout our experiments, we used the Brill part-of-speech tagger to create testing and training material (Brill, 1993). Our trigram model was created using seven million words of tagged material drawn from the British National Corpus (BNC); training material consisted of 43,000 tagged sentences also taken from the BNC. For test material, we took 429 sentences taken from the Spoken English Corpus (SEC). To compute crossing rates, recall and precision figures, we used a program called Parseval to compare most probable parses with manually produced parses (232 trees in total taken from the SEC) (Harrison et al., 19). To measure overgeneration, we randomly generated 250 strings. From a manual inspection, these do appear to be ungrammatical.

Also, our learner used virtually no supervision (for example parsed corpora), and did not start with a given lexicon: learning using parsed corpora is substantiMly easier than learning from just a tagged text, whilst starting with a given, manually constructed lexicon is equivalent to learning with a good initial estimation of the target lexicon, which greatly increases the chance of successful learning.
