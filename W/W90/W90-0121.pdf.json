{"sections":[{"title":"","paragraphs":["devices address beliefs presumably entertained by the listener which may affect the acquisition of the IM, but, unlike the beliefs addressed by Instantiations and Descriptions, are not directly instrumental to its comprehension [Zukerman 1990b]. Our mechanism is based on ideas introduced in [Zukerrnan and Cheong 1988], and it follows the tenet that Peripheral RDs are generated to invalidate anticipated impairments to a listener's comprehension process. To this effect, our mechanism departs from the existing discourse generation strategies, and adopts a predictive approach, whereby the effect of a message is simulated on a shal-low model of a listener's beliefs. If an impairment to the comprehension process is anticipated by this model, the generation of a remedial rhetorical device is called for.","In the following section, we briefly consider a model of a listener's beliefs capable of predicting commonly drawn inferences. We then describe our mechanism for the generation of Peripheral RDs.","Model of a Listener's Beliefs In order to address beliefs presumably entertained by a particular listener, we maintain an epistemological model which represents a listener's beliefs as a function of the presented material. This function accounts both for direct and indirect inferences drawn from presented messages [Zukerman 1990a].","We represent a listener's beliefs by means of a network whose nodes contain individual information items and whose links contain the relationships between the nodes (see Figure 2). The information in the network is represented at a level of detail which is consistent with the level of expertise required to learn the subject at hand, e.g., for a high-school student learning algebra, well-known concepts, such as numerical addition and subtraction, are primitive, whereas relatively new or complex concepts, such as bracket simplification, are represented in terms of more primitive concepts. The links in the network are labeled according to the manner in which they were acquired, i.e., they can either be Inferred, Told or previously Known, where Inferred links are generated by means of generally applicable Common-sense Inference Rules. In addition, each link is accompanied by a Measure of Belief (MB) between -1 and 1, akin to Certainty Factors [Buchanan and Shortliffe 1985], which represents a user's level of expertise. The nodes are labeled according to their complexity, p for primitive concepts and e for complex ones. Like links, nodes may be Inferred, Told or previously Known, and each node has a Degree of Expertise (DE) between 0 and 1. The DE of a c-node is a function of the DEs and MBs of its constituent nodes and links, respectively.","In this paper, we focus on technical domains, where the transmitted information typically pertains to procedures, objects and goals. We define a context as a triple composed of a procedure, an object to which it is applied, and the goal accomplished by this procedure when applied to this object (labeled cl-c4 in Figure 2), to reflect the fact that one procedure may achieve different goals when applied to different objects. For example, factoring out a common factor will only partially factorize a quadratic trinomial such as 3x2+5x-2, while it will completely factorize a binomial such as 3x2+5x.

These roles are inspired by rule adaptations commonly performed by students which were studied by Matz (1982), Brown and Van Lehn (1980), Van Lehn (1983) and Sleeman (1984). In order to account for the deductive abilities of a particular type of listener, we annotate each rule with a measure of uncertainty, denoted p, which represents a listener's belief in the validity of a conclusion given that the evidence is certain. This measure resembles the rule strength used in ACT* [Anderson 1983]. The application of the similarity-based rule in Figure 3 to the context cl and the link [Numbers simile AT] in Figure 2 yields the erroneous context e3. 3 In the actual network each link may have a counterpart representing the inverse relationship.

Let us first consider the Affect-related impairments.","Confusion occurs when an inference decreases significandy a listener's confidence in a previous belief, causing a discomforting transition from a self-perception of possessing knowledge to one of increased uncertainty. In terms of our network model, Confusion takes place when the absolute value of an Anticipated Measure of Belief (AMB), obtained by combining the MB of a link with the MB of an inference regarding this link, is significantly lower than the absolute value of the original MB of this link. For instance, the statement \"One cannot always add algebraic terms,\" which yields a negative value for the MB of the link [+/- apply-to AI'] in Figure 2, may trigger the erroneous inference [+/- -apply-to LT], which contradicts the link [+/- apply-to LT], thereby lowering its MB.

This MB may represent either a correct belief or an incorrect belief.","The immediate invalidation of Affect-related impairments is essential for the smooth continuation of the knowledge acquisition process, since their persistence diverts a listener's mental resources from the task of acquiring knowledge. On the other hand, the invalidation of Belief-related impairments with respect to links which are not currently in focus may be temporarily postponed due to didactic or stylistic considerations. Therefore, although Confusion may take place in conjunction with a Belief-related impairment, the recognition and subsequent invalidation of Confusion takes precedence over the detection of this impairment (see Figure 4). Selection of Rhetorical Devices The Selection mechanism proposes a Peripheral RD to address a recognized impairment. The type of this rhetorical device, its wording, and its position in the final message sequence depend on the type of the impairment, the correctness and magnitude of the previous MB of the culprit link, and the SMB of this link (see Table I). The strength of an impairment affects the need for additional explanations, such as Causal explanations and Instantiations, to convey a Peripheral RD. 159","Table 1: Peripheral RDs as a Function of","Impair.ment Types and Link Values","Impairment","Type","Loss of","Interest Confusion Mislearnin 8 Insufficient Learning","Insignificant Change Link Value Peripheral RD Correct Motivate (add links', Incorrect Contradict link Correct Revise link Incorrect Contradict link","I ..... -- Contradict inference -- Revise inference High MB (Correct) Revise link High MB (Incorrect) Contradict link [ Low MB (SMB >0) Revise information Low MB (SMB <0)","The Link Value column in Table 1 contains information pertaining to the previous MB and the SMB of the culprit link. This information is unnecessary when addressing Mislearning and Insufficient Learning, since these impairments are completely characterized by their type. However, for the rest of the impairments, the correctness of the previous MB is the main factor in the determination of the type of a Peripheral RD. Loss of Interest is invalidated by a Contradiction of a culprit link, if such a link is identified; otherwise, a Motivation has to generated by adding nodes and links which render the new information non-redundant, e.g., \"You already know how to solve quadratic equations by completion to square. A faster method is ... \" (demil~ regarding the types of Motivations which are suitable for different situations and users appear in [Zukerman 1987]). The invalidation of an Insignificant Change in a link with an MB representative of lack of expertise, i.e., an MB whose absolute value is close to 0, is performed in a manner similar to the correction of complete ignorance. That is, if the SMB of this link is positive, this impairment is invalidated by a Revision of the relevant informarion, whereas ff it is negative, i.e., representative of disbelief, no Peripheral RD is proposed, since it may be superfluous to induce disbelief with respect to a proposition which is hardly entertained by a listener.","As seen in Table 1, we distinguish between two types of Peripheral RDs according to the source of the belief being addressed, namely Peripheral RDs which address previously existing links and Peripheral RDs which address current inferences. This distinction is not always reflected in the English realization of a rhetorical device, rather, it may affect the Meta Comments which accompany it and its position in the final message sequence. For instance, the propagation of the Contradiction [BrS ~apply-to AT] may yield the erroneous inference [BrS --,aBly-to LT] which in turn may cause an impairment in the link [BrS apply-to LT]. If the anticipated impairment is Confusion, it will be invalidated by a Revision of this link, whereas if it is Mislearning, it will be invalidated by a Contradiction of the erroneous hfference. The most succinct realization of both Peripheral RDs is the sentence \"You can always"]},{"title":"simplify","paragraphs":["bracketed Like Terms.\" However, the Revision of the previous belief may appear either before or after the above Contradiction and include a Meta Comment which states the source of this belief, e.g., \"As we saw in Section 7, you can always simplify bracketed Like Terms\"; while the Contradiction of the erroneous inference would usually appear after the above Contradiction and would be accompanied by a Meta Comment which indicates a violation of an expectation established by the inference, e.g., \"Bracket simplification does not always apply to algebraic terms, but it always applies to Like Terms.\" The Peripheral RDs proposed by our Selection mechanism contain sufficient information to support the generation of these types of Meta Comments by means of mechanisms such as the ones presented in [Zukerman and Pearl 1986] and [Zukerman 1989].

During this process, inferences from different messages which affect the same link are merged into one inference with a combined effect (lines 5-7). Recognition then ascertains the attributes of the impairments which are likely to be caused by these inferences (line 8). For instance, the Propagation of the input message [DL apply-to AT has-goal BrE] and the Contradiction [BrS -,apply-to AT] in the sample network in Figure 2 may yield the inferences in Table 2. In principle, each of these inferences may be responsible for an impairment. However, as stated above, the effect of these inferences ultimately depends on the p-s of the rules applied in the propagation process and on the MBs of the affected links. In our present discussion, we assume that Confusion was recognized in the links [BrS apply-to LT] and [BrS apply-to Numbers].","Based on Gricean maxims of cooperative conversation (Grice 1975), we propose to generate a minimal number of rhetorical devices to invalidate impairments occurring concurrently in a number of links. To this end, we iterate over the set of impairments, selecting at each stage the culprit link with the highest ranking impairment (line 10). The impairments are ranked according to their type and strength, where impairments causing Confusion are ranked higher than Belief-related impairments. A Peripheral RD is then proposed to invalidate the impairment in the selected link, and its effect is propagated (lines 12-14). Once a Peripheral RD has been generated to address a particular link, further inferences drawn during the same activation of Impairment-Invalidate no longer affect this link. For each iterauon, the set of impairments is updated by merging the inferenccs responsible for the previously recognized impairments with the inferences resulting from the most recent propagation, and reapplying the Recognition process 0ines 15-16). In this manner, a low-ranking impairment in a given link may be spontaneously invalidated by an inference resulting from a Peripheral RD generated to invalidate an impairment in another link. For example, ff the impairment in the link [BrS apply-to Numbers] ranks higher than the impairment in the link [BrS apply-to LT], a Revision is generated to invalidate the impairment in the former link. The propagation of this Revision may invalidate the Confusion with respect to the latter link.

However, in a knowledge acquisition setting, misconceptions are generally not allowed to pile up, hence Contradictions to existing beliefs are expected only during the initial stages of the propagation process. Therefore, although in principle our algorithm may iterate indefinitely, in practice, impairments should no longer be detected after a few iteraations, and the process should halt after proposing a few Peripheral RDs. This expectation is confirmed by tests run with our sample network (see next section). However, this network is rather small, and there may be situations in which the number of Peripheral RDs proposed by our mechanism will have to be restricted due to stylistic or pedagogical considerations. In such cases, our mechanism will have to be adjusted to invalidate only a subset of the recognized impairments such as the highest ranking impairments or impairments in links which are closest to the IM."]},{"title":"Evaluation","paragraphs":["Procedure Impairment-Invalidate has been implemented in a system called WISHFUL, which was run on several instances of the network in Figure 2. These instances featured MBs which represented three types of students: (1) Competent -- with high MBs associated with correct beliefs, (2) Average- containing some incorrect beliefs and medium-range MBs associated with correct beliefs, and (3) Mediocre -- with very low MBs associated with most beliefs. The initial values assigned to the MBs of the finks and the p-s of the Common-sense Inference Rules yielded Peripheral RDs which were compatible with rhetorical devices people would generate under similar circumstances, and the response time was instantaneous for these rather small networks. As expected, changes in the p-s of the Common-sense Inference Rules resulted in variations in the generated RDs, with additional Contradictions due to Misleaming being generated as the p-s of unsound rules increased, and additional Revisions due to Insufficient Learning as the p-s of sound rules decreased. In addition, the number and strength of the recognized impairments increased as the ability of the students being represented in a network decreased, iadicating that additional explanations would be required to convey a message to the poorer students. In particular, for the networks representing competent students, either Revisions of inferences due to Insufficient Learning or no Peripheral RDs were proposed (depending on the p-s of the Common-sense Inference Rules); for the networks representing average students, Contradictions and Revisions were proposed in a manner similar to the explanations in this paper, and for the networks representing mediocre students most of the proposed Peripheral RDs were Revisions of information.","Our mechanism has also proven successful as an analytical tool. It accounts for the presence of Peripheral RDs in over twenty texts in a variety of domains, rang-ing from expert domains (Telecommunications, Cognitive Science and Linguistics) through intermediate ones (high-school Algebra, Data Structures, Lisp and introductory Chess) to novice domains (Childcraft Encyclopedia and Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care).

However, for this mechanism to generate effective discourse on a continued basis, the model of the fistener's beliefs must be updated by an independent assessment of the his/her understanding.","In addition, our mechanism must be implemented on different domains and larger networks to test both its response time and the adequacy and number of the proposed rhetorical devices.

In addition, an alternative representation for MBs which keeps track of the sources of an inference is being considered. Further research is required to recognize and rectify possible misconceptions in the Common-sense Inference Rules, and to characterize conditions for the generation of rhetorical devices which satisfy a number of communicative goals. Finally, the effect of the knowledge representation and the rules of inference on the types of the proposed rhetorical devices needs to be further investigated.","Conclusion This paper offers a text planning mechanism which supports the generation of explanations tailored to particular types of users. Our mechanism generates Peripheral RDs which help convey an intended message by anticipating and preventing potential impairments to a listener's comprehension process. To this effect, it characterizes these impairments in terms of a model of a fistener's beliefs and inferences, and simulates a fistener's comprehension process on this model.
