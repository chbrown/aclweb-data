Thus, devisers of text generation systems are frequently called upon to provide their own analyses of the discourse function of various kinds of alternations. In this paper, I describe a proposed research tool which is designed to help a researcher explore and analyze a natural-language \"target text\" in order to determine the contextual factors that predict the choice of one or another lexical item or grammatical feature. The project described in this paper is still at the drawing-board stage; I welcome sugges-tions about ways it could be changed or expanded to fulfill particular analytic needs."]},{"title":"Theoretical","paragraphs":["preliminaries While some aspects of a natural-language text are determined by the nature of the information a speaker wishes to convey to a hearer, there are many more aspects that seem to be determined by certain cognitive needs that the hearer has. Speakers tailor their output to the informational resources and deficiencies of the hearer in several ways: by adjusting the amount of information they make explicit, by arranging new information relative to old information in a maximally helpful way, and by giving special marking to information that may be difficult for the hearer to access for a variety of reasons. It is these strategies that give rise to the wide variety of syntactic and lexical resources of any natural language for saying the \"same thing\" in different ways. We can call the relation between lexico-grammatical features and the speaker's communicative goals in choosing those features the \"discourse functions\" of the features.","For any particular alternation, then, the best predictor of the speaker's choice should be a model of the cognitive state of the hearer. Unfortunately, neither human speakers nor computer systems have direct access to the hearer's mind. But linguists have long realized that we do have access to a fair approximation of an important subset of the information the hearer possesses at a given point in a discourse: namely the text which has been produced up to that point. ([Chafe 1987] and [Giv6n 1983] are two contemporary expressions of that principle.) And in fact we can make fairly good predictions of lexico-grammatical choices based on inferences that come from the nature of the preceding text. For instance, a referent that has been referred to in the previous clause is likely to receive minimal coding (a pronoun or zero, depending on syntactic considerations). But this principle can be overridden by the presence of other factors that interfere with the accessibility of the referent -- e.g. a paragraph break or another competing referent -- resulting in the use of a full noun phrase. Or, to give another example, a speaker is likely to use special syntax (such as the \"presentative\" or \"there is...\" construction) to introduce a referent that will be prominent in the following discourse; so a hearer is likely to have easier access to a referent introduced in that way than one that has been introduced \"casually\", e.g. in a prepositional phrase. Therefore, subsequent references to a referent that has been introduced with a presentative are more likely to be pronouns than noun phrases.","These are all factors that can be discerned in the preceding text and are taken into account by speakers as affecting the nature of the bearer's expectations. Therefore under these perturbing circumstances the speaker can decide to use a fuller reference, e.g. a proper name or noun phrase. Figure 1 illustrates the relation between the discourse produced by the speaker, the hearer's mental state, and the speaker's model of the hearer. In real face-to-face interaction, the hearer can influence the speaker's model of her or him in more direct ways -- e.g. by verbal and nonverbal indications of agreement, understanding, protest, or confusion. But this two-way channel is available neither to human writers nor to computer text generators. 39","Speaker's eommunieaKve Bearer's mental sure,","goa.L~ / including rel~resentatian","Speaker's modet / of speech","oj' heater's state // Figure 1: A model of communication.","The fact that we can draw inferences from preceding text about the hearer's slate justifies the methodology common in functional linguistics whereby the Enguist investigates the function of a particular morpho-syntactic alternation by attempting to discover correlations in natural texts between that alternation and various features of the context. This method is also likely to be the one which will lead to the best results for text generation specialists, since prior text is one information source any computational system has easy access to as a guide in making future decisions.","There are, of course, currently available several large-scale databases of English texts of various kinds, some of which have been provided with various amounts and kinds of coding (from word-class lagging to syntactic analysis). However, for many kinds of discourse work these databases have not been useful. On the one hand, such databases are often not available in languages other than English; on-the other, the coding that is provided assumes an analysis which may not meet the needs of a particular user. In fact it is often the case that aspects of the syntactic analysis depend on a functional analysis having already been done; so a pre-coded database may contain assumptions about the answers to the same qtfestions it is supposed to be helping to solve. The tool described here is designed for the user who is satisfied with a relatively small amount of data, but wants to have total control over the analysis of the corpus.","Currently, functional linguists often enter their text data into commercial relational database tools, such as DBase and Paradox. However, such tools have been designed with other kinds of applications in mind, and therefore there are many properties of natural language texts which these tools can only capture by awkward or indirect means. Specifically, natural language texts, unlike e.g. client or sales lists, are simultaneously"]},{"title":"linear","paragraphs":["(order matters) and"]},{"title":"recursively hierarchical.","paragraphs":["Thus, the query languages available with such database products are generally good at extracting the kind of information from texts which is least useful to linguists, but require considerable ad hoc programming to extract the kind of information most relevant to our needs. The tool proposed here, conversely, should answer most easily the questions a discourse analyst wants to ask most frequently.","These problems in representing certain crucial aspects of natural language texts computationally using off-the-shelf tools have sent many linguists hack to marking up xeroxed texts by hand with colored pencils. The approach outlined here is intended to combine the advantages of the colored-pencil technique (spontaneity, flexibility, and direct involvement with the whole text) with the advantages of computational techniques (quick and painless identification, compilation, and comparison of various features of text units).","Description of the tool The tool proposed in this paper will aid in the generation of hypotheses concerning the discourse function of a lexico-grammatical feature (or combination of features) by allowing the researcher to isolate instances of that feature and view them in relation to various aspects of its discourse context. When the researcher has arrived at and stated a working hypothesis about which features of the context are most relevant to predicting the targeted feature, the system will be able to test the hypothesis against the data and provide feedback by displaying both predicted and non-predicted occurrences of the target feature. Further refinements can then be made until the fit between the researcher's hypothesis and the actual text is as good as possible. The hypothesis can then be integrated into a text generation system with some assurance that the lexico-grammatical choices made by the system will approximate those made by a human with a similar text-production task.","In order for the tool to be able to recognize and compare various text features -- including relatively covert information such as the reference of noun phrases and the mood of a sentence as well as relatively overt cues such as lexical items and structure -- the user must first annotate the text, indicating a) its hierarchical structure, and b) a set of features (attribute/value pairs) associated with each constituent. The annotation will be largely manual (though aspects of it can be automated, as will be explained), because we want the tool itself to be neutral as 40 to the theoretical assumptions inherent in any particular analysis. Thus, it will be possible to use this tool to test among other things the comparative predictive usefulness of various possible analyses of a text.","Using the tool will have the following phases: ."]},{"title":"Annotation:","paragraphs":["mark constituents, and for each constituent indicate its category membership and any other desired features.

I propose an interface which will allow the user to open a \"query window\", in which he or she can enter a partial specification of one or more constituents to be matched against the text, using the same entry techniques as are used to enter, edit, and annotate actual text. This approach has the advantage of letting the user make use of what he or she already knows about the annotation process to specify the target pattern, and furthermore it allows the identification of highly complex patterns in an intuitive way.","A pattern specification will contain the following kinds of elements:","1. Actual structure (brackets), text, and feature bundles. ~",".

For instance, the following two queries would match constituents containing two elements of the same category conjoined by \"and\", as in \"Jill and Liza\" or \"sang off-key and danced the waltz\". The (a) version would highlight the whole conjoined phrase; the (b) version would highlight each of the conjoined phrases, but not \"and\". (The dots are wildcards, explained below.

Using queries to change annotation Extensive experience with feature-coding of text data has shown that there is a large number of features which are predictable from the identity of lexical items and/or combinations of other features. In these cases it is very convenient to be able to partially code a text and to fill in the redundant codes by using queries. Similarly, it is some-times desirable to use redundant information in an annotated text to change or delete features when you change your mind about the best coding scheme. Furthermore, if it is possible to insert structure boundaries on the basis of patterns found in the text, it is even possible to perform some structure insertion automatically, giving the user in effect the possibility of using queries to automatically parse the text where this can be done reliably. he most straightforward way to implement this is to allow the user to specify two patterns, an \"old\" pattern and a \"new\" pattern. The query illustrated in figure 5 creates a verb phrase constituent wherever a verb is followed by a noun phrase which is its object. Figure 5: A change query. Distance queries. When text is viewed as a window to the cognitive processes of the speaker, it becomes apparent that the distance between e.g. two mentions of a referent or two clauses referring to the same event can be important. This is because the evidence suggests that the cognitive accessibility (to the hearer) of a referent \"decays\" over time, so that speakers need to do more work to accomplish reference to something that has not been mentioned recently (of. [Giv6n 1983, Chafe 1987]; the explanation presumably has to do with general properties of short term memory storage). For this reason, it is desirable to have a way to measure the text distance between two items. There are various ideas \"in the air\" about what the appropriate units for measuring distance are (e.g. clauses, intonation units, conversational turns), and different measures are clearly appropriate for different text types; so it is desirable to define distance queries so that the user can specify the unit to be counted as well as the beginning and ending patterns (the two items whose separation is being measured). The result of a simple distance query is naturally an integer; but where the beginning and ending patterns are general, the result should be a list of integers which can then be averaged. Finally, in order to make it easy to reference distance information in future queries, it should be possible to save the distance result as a value of a feature with a user-specified attribute.","Figure 6 illustrates a query which computes \"lookback\" (i.e. the distance between two NPs with the same referent) for pronouns, using the clause as a unit. It averages the 44 lookback value, so that average pronoun lookback can be compared with e.g. average full noun phrase lookback.

Additional components In the furore, it would be very desirable to implement the possibility of adding additional components so that all linguistic information need not be stored directly in the text. For instance, it would be nice to allow a lexicon component, which would contain partial feature specifications of lexical items (including e.g. category, number, tense, semantic class). Queries could then search the lexicon as well as the text for the presnece of features, obviating the need to manually perform highly predictable annotation. It is easy to see how currently available large-scale lexical databases could be adapted to this purpose, obviating a large amount of hand annotation. A \"slructurecon\" could perform a similar function for larger units.

Since the tool has not yet been implemented, I have chosen an area where previous research has given a good indication of what the answers to queries would probably be: the introduction into dis-45 course of referents which are new to the hearer (in the sense of \"nonidentifiable\"). The following discussion draws largely on the results reported in [Du Bois 1980]. The category of nonidentifiable referent can be approximated by the feature \"first mention\". Therefore, the first step will be to use the method described above to automatically add the \"mention\" feature to each noun phrase (this procedure will assign the feature \"mention = 0\" to first mentions).

One way to cope with these instances is to insert \"pseudo-constituents\" into the text at the point where the associated entity is mentioned, and rerunning the mention-number query. These references would no longer count as first mentions, and a retry of query 12 would reveal a much smaller number of excep-tions.","This example could be extended, but it is hoped that it will illustrate the way such a tool could be used for quick and easy exploration of the functional attributes of linguistic forms."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This paper was improved by comments from Sandy Thompson, Randy Sparks, and an anonymous reviewer.
