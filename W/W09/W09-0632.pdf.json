Evolutionary algorithms operate over a population of individuals (possible solutions for a problem) that evolve according to selection rules and genetic operators. The fitness function is a metric that evaluates each of the possible solutions, ensuring that the average adaptation of the population increases each generation. Repeating this process hundreds or thousands of times leads to very good solutions for the problem.","We encode as a fitness function the specific constraints required for the reference to be acceptable. The crossover and mutation genetic operators ensure a reasonable variation between the different options much as a human-generated text would.","Each individual is represented by a set of genes that are the list of possible attributes in the reference. Each gene has an associated value of 0 (if the attribute is not included in the reference), or 1 (if the attribute is included in the reference). The initial population should have a low number of genes set to 1, because references tend to be short and the use of all the possible attributes should be avoided.","For the crossover operator, two individuals are selected randomly and crossed by a random point of their structure. For the mutation operator, some of the genes are chosen randomly to be mutated from 1 to 0, or vice versa.","The fitness function must find a balance between the univocal identification of a referent, and a natural use of attributes. The formula used as fitness function is defined in Equation 1: f itindi = fatti ∗weightatt+ident∗weightid (1) where ident represents whether the reference is univocally identifying the target among the distractors, and fatti computes the role of attributes as the normalised sum of the weight (depending on its absolute frecuency in ATTRIBUTE-SET elements in the corpus) of all attributes present (gene=1), as defined by Equation 2: fatti = ∑","geneatti ∗ weightatti #attsRef (2)"]},{"title":"2 Case-Based Reasoning for Realization","paragraphs":["Template-based solutions for natural language generation rely on reusing fragments of text extracted from typical texts in a given domain, apply-ing a process of abstraction that identifies which part of them is common to all uses, and leaving certain gaps to be filled with details correspond-ing to a new use. A case-based solution (Aamodt and Plaza, 1994) to reference realization can obtain the information needed to realize a reference from the original examples of appropriate use that originated the templates.","In our approach, a case consists of a description of the problem (ATTRIBUTE-SET) and a solution (ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING interpreted as a template). Cases are stored in a Case Retrieval Net (CRN) (Lenz and Burkhard, 1996), a memory model developed to improve the efficiency of the retrieval tasks of the CBR cycle. Each attribute-value pair from the ATTRIBUTE-SET is a node in the net. Templates in ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING are considered as solutions to the cases. Similarities between the nodes are established for the retrieval stage of the CBR process. For example, we have considered that ‘back’ and ‘right’ orientation values have a higher similarity than ‘back’ and ‘front’ that are exactly the opposite.","The attribute-value pairs of ATTRIBUTE-SET that must be realized in a final string are used to query the net, which returns the more similar cases. Only one of them must be chosen to be adapted for the solution. We consider four different types of retrieved cases: preferred (cases with exactly the same attributes than the query), more (cases with the same attributes as the query and 187","String Edit Norm.
