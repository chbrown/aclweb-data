Text mining and information extraction systems can provide an important, low cost and timely early warning system in these circumstances by identifying the first signs of an outbreak automatically from online textual news. One interesting characteristic of disease outbreak reports — which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before — is their use of speculative language (hedging) to describe uncertain situations. This paper describes two uses of hedging to enhance the BioCaster disease outbreak report text mining system.","Following a brief description of the BioCaster system and corpus (section 2), we discuss in section 3 previous uses of hedging in NLP and the methods used to identify hedges in the current work. In section 4 we describe some initial classification experiments using hedge features. Section 5 describes a “speculative” method of tagging disease outbreak reports with a metric designed to aid users of the BioCaster system in identifying articles of interest."]},{"title":"2 BioCaster System & Corpus","paragraphs":["The BioCaster system scans online news reports for stories concerning infectious disease outbreaks (e.g. H5N1, Ebola) and makes its results available to registered users as email alerts (Collier et al., 2008). In addition to this email service, data that has been filtered through a topic classifier but which is still uninterpreted is used to populate a Google Map application called the Global Health Monitor.1","The BioCaster corpus consists of 1000 news articles downloaded from the WWW and then manually categorized and annotated with Named Entities by two PhD students. Articles were collected from various news sources (e.g. BBC, New York Times and ProMED-Mail2","). Each document is classified as either relevant (350) or reject (650).3","The corpus is designed to include difficult borderline cases where more advanced understanding of the context is required. For example, an article may be about, say, polio, but not centrally concerned with specific outbreaks of that disease. Instead, the article could report a vaccination campaign or research breakthrough."]},{"title":"3 Hedges","paragraphs":["According to Hyland (1998), in an extensive study of speculative language in science writing, hedges “are the means by which writers can present a proposition as an opinion rather than a fact.” More recently, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) have presented a method for automatically identifying hedges in the biomedical domain. In the current work, we used a science orientated hedge lexicon derived from Mercer et al. (2004). The lexicon consisted of 72 verbs (including appear, appears, appeared, appearing, indicate, indicates, indicated, indicating, and so on) and 32 non-verbs (including, about, quite, poten-1 www.biocaster.org 2 ProMED-Mail is a human curated service for monitoring","disease outbreak reports (www.promedmail.org.) 3 For copyright reasons, the BioCaster corpus is not pub-","licly available. 142","Rank Hedge Rank Hedge 1 reported 9 suggests 2 suspected 10 estimated 3 probable 11 appeared 4 suspect 12 appearing 5 usually 13 mostly 6 see 14 assumes 7 reports 15 predicted 8 sought 16 suggested Table 1: Statistically Significant Hedges Features","Naive Bayes SVM","Acc F Acc F","9000 χ2","94.8 0.93 92.2 0.89","Unigram 88.4 0.85 90.9 0.87","Unigram+hedge 88.0 0.85 91.7 0.89 Table 2: Classification Results tially, likely and so on).

We used hedging features to augment this classifier, and evaluated the results using a subset of the BioCaster corpus. One binary hedging feature was used. The feature was “true” if and only if one of the 105 hedge lexemes identified by Mercer et al. (2004) occurred in the input document within 5 words of a disease named entity. Results are shown in Table 2, where it can be seen that the addition of a single binary hedge feature to the unigram feature set increases accuracy by 0.8%.

The bottom third of documents had hedge percentages in the range 0% - 0.2544% (LOW). The middle third had hedge percentages in the range 0.2545% - 1.0574 (MEDIUM). The range for the top third was 1.0575% - 100% (HIGH). Documents inputted to the BioCaster system automatically have their proportion of hedge words calculated and are assigned a value according to their position on the scale (LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH). Table 3 shows that a majority of the documents in the accept segment of the BioCaster corpus can be tagged as highly speculative using this method."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["N.
