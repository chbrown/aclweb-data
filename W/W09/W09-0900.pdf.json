This workshop is the second of a series which was initiated during ACL 2007, held in Prague. The first edition of the workshop was organised by Anna Korhonen, Paula Buttery and Aline Villavicencio. The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous speech and language processing tasks including speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing, lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. Advances in these areas are generally viewed as engineering achievements, but recently researchers have begun to investigate the relevance of computational learning techniques to research on human language acquisition. These investigations have double significance since an improved understanding of human language acquisition will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general, but may also feed back to the NLP community, placing researchers in a better position to develop new language models and/or techniques. Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. The aim of this workshop is thus to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP, machine learning, artificial intelligence, linguistics, psycho-linguistics, etc. who are interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding human language learning. The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational and cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help initiate interdisciplinary research projects. In the call for papers we solicited papers describing cognitive aspects of computational language acquisition. The programme committee has selected 7 papers for publication that are representative of the state-of-the-art in this interdisciplinary area. Each full-length submission was independently reviewed by three members of the program committee, who then collectively faced the difficult task of selecting a subset of papers for publication from a very strong field. We would like to thank our two invited speakers, Massimo Poesio and Robert Berwick, all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the programme committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers. Our thanks go also to the organisers of the main conference, the publication chairs, and the conference workshop committee headed by Miriam Butt and Stephen Clark.

We feel this is a mistake as evidence from these related disciplines can provide us with better ways of evaluating our results. In the talk I will present work in CIMEC on using cognitive evidence to evaluate the results of lexical acquisition work - specifically, using feature norms to evaluate the acquisition of features, and using EEG data to evaluate the results of categorization experiments. Joint work with Marco Baroni, Brian Murphy, Eduard Barbu, and Abdulrahman Almuhareb, among others. Treebank Parsing and Knowledge of Language: A Cognitive Perspective Robert C. Berwick Over the past 15 years, there has been increasing use of linguistically annotated sentence collections such as the LDC Penn Tree Bank (PTB) for constructing statistically based parsers. While these parsers have generally been built for engineering purposes, more recently such approaches have been advanced as potential cognitive solutions, e.g., for the problem of human language acquisition. Here we examine this possibility critically: we assess how well these Treebank parsers actually approach human/child language competence. We find that such systems fail to replicate many, perhaps most, empirically attested grammaticality judgments; seem overly sensitive, rather than robust, to training data idiosyncrasies; and easily acquire unnatural syntactic constructions never attested in human languages. Overall, we conclude that existing statistically based treebank parsers fail to incorporate much knowledge of language in these three senses. We discuss the implications of these results for the improvement of Treebank parsers and their cognitive relevance. Joint work with Professor Sandiway Fong, University of Arizona. xi"]}]}
