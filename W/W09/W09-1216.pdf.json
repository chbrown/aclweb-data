The parser is implemented as a pipeline of linear classifiers trained with support vector machines. I use only first order features, and no pair-wise feature combinations in order to reduce training and prediction times. Hyper-parameters are carefully tuned for each language and sub-problem. The system is evaluated on seven different languages: Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, German, Japanese and Spanish. An analysis of learning rates and of the reliance on syntactic parsing quality shows that only modest improvements could be expected for most languages given more training data; Better syntactic parsing quality, on the other hand, could greatly improve the results. Individual tun-ing of hyper-parameters is crucial for obtaining good semantic parsing quality."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper presents my submission for the semantic parsing track of the CoNLL 2009 shared task on syntactic and semantic dependencies in multiple languages (Hajič et al., 2009). The submitted parser is simpler than the submission in which I participated at the CoNLL 2008 shared task on joint learning of syntactic and semantic dependencies (Surdeanu et al., 2008), in which we used a more complex committee based approach to both syntax and semantics (Samuelsson et al., 2008). Results are on par with our previous system, while the parser is orders of magnitude faster both at training and prediction time and is able to process natural language text in Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, German, Japanese and Spanish. The parser depends on the input to be annotated with part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies."]},{"title":"2 Semantic parser","paragraphs":["The semantic parser is implemented as a pipeline of","linear classifiers and a greedy constraint satisfaction","post-processing step. The implementation is very","similar to the best performing subsystem of the com-","mittee based system in Samuelsson et al. (2008). Parsing consists of four steps: predicate sense","disambiguation, argument identification, argument","classification and predicate frame constraint satis-","faction. The first three steps are implemented us-","ing linear classifiers, along with heuristic filtering","techniques. Classifiers are trained using the sup-","port vector machine implementation provided by the","LIBLINEAR software (Fan et al., 2008). MALLET","is used as a framework for the system (McCallum,","2002). For each classifier, the c-parameter of the SVM","is optimised by a one dimensional grid search using","threefold cross validation on the training set. For","the identification step, the c-parameter is optimised","with respect to F1-score of the positive class, while","for sense disambiguation and argument labelling the","optimisation is with respect to accuracy. The regions","to search were identified by initial runs on the devel-","opment data. Optimising these parameters for each","classification problem individually proved to be cru-","cial for obtaining good results. 2.1 Predicate sense disambiguation Since disambiguation of predicate sense is a multiclass problem, I train the classifiers using the method of Crammer and Singer (2002), using the implementation provided by LIBLINEAR. Sense labels do not generalise over predicate lemmas, so one classifier is trained for each lemma occurring in the training data. Rare predicates are given the most common sense of the predicate. Predicates occurring less than 103 7 times in the training data were heuristically determined to be considered rare. Predicates with unseen lemmas are labelled with the most common sense tag in the training data. 2.1.1 Feature templates","The following feature templates are used for predi-","cate sense disambiguation: PREDICATEWORD PREDICATE[POS/FEATS] PREDICATEWINDOWBAGLEMMAS PREDICATEWINDOWPOSITION[POS/FEATS] GOVERNORRELATION GOVERNOR[WORD/LEMMA] GOVERNOR[POS/FEATS] DEPENDENTRELATION DEPENDENT[WORD/LEMMA] DEPENDENT[POS/FEATS] DEPENDENTSUBCAT.","The *WINDOW feature templates extract features","from the two preceding and the two following tokens","around the predicate, with respect to the linear order-","ing of the tokens. The *FEATS templates are based","on information in the PFEATS input column for the","languages where this information is provided. 2.2 Argument identification and labelling In line with most previous pipelined systems, identification and labelling of arguments are performed as two separate steps. The classifiers in the identification step are trained with the standard L2-loss SVM formulation, while the classifiers in the labelling step are trained using the method of Crammer and Singer.","In order to reduce the number of candidate arguments in the identification step, I apply the filtering technique of Xue and Palmer (2004), trivially adopted to the dependency syntax formalism. Further, a filtering heuristic is applied in which argument candidates with rare predicate / argument part-of-speech combinations are removed; rare meaning that the argument candidate is actually an argument in less than 0.05% of the occurrences of the pair. These heuristics greatly reduce the number of in-stances in the argument identification step and improve performance by reducing noise from the training data. Separate classifiers are trained for verbal pred-","icates and for nominal predicates, both in order","to save computational resources and because the","frame structures do not generalise between verbal","and nominal predicates. For Czech, in order to re-","duce training time I split the argument identification","problem into three sub-problems: verbs, nouns and","others, based on the part-of-speech of the predicate.","In hindsight, after solving a file encoding related bug","which affected the separability of the Czech data","set, a split into verbal and nominal predicates would","have sufficed. Unfortunately I was not able to rerun","the Czech experiments on time. 2.2.1 Feature templates","The following feature templates are used both for","argument identification and argument labelling: PREDICATELEMMASENSE PREDICATE[POS/FEATS] POSITION ARGUMENT[POS/FEATS] ARGUMENT[WORD/LEMMA] ARGUMENTWINDOWPOSITIONLEMMA ARGUMENTWINDOWPOSITION[POS/FEATS] LEFTSIBLINGWORD LEFTSIBLING[POS/FEATS] RIGHTSIBLINGWORD RIGHTSIBLING[POS/FEATS] LEFTDEPENDENTWORD RIGHTDEPENDENT[POS/FEATS] RELATIONPATH TRIGRAMRELATIONPATH GOVERNORRELATION GOVERNORLEMMA GOVERNOR[POS/FEATS]","Most of these features, introduced by Gildea and Ju-","rafsky (2002), belong to the folklore by now. The","TRIGRAMRELATIONPATH is a ”soft” version of the","RELATIONPATH template, which treats the relation","path as a bag of triplets of directional labelled depen-","dency relations. Initial experiments suggested that","this feature slightly improves performance, by over-","coming local syntactic parse errors and data sparse-","ness in the case of small training sets. 2.2.2 Predicate frame constraints Following Johansson and Nugues (2008) I impose the CORE ARGUMENT CONSISTENCY and CON-104 TINUATION CONSISTENCY constraints on the generated semantic frames. In the cited work, these constraints are used to filter the candidate frames for a re-ranker. I instead perform a greedy search in which only the core argument with the highest score is kept when the former constraint is violated. The latter constraint is enforced by simply dropping any continuation argument lacking its correspond-ing core argument. Initial experiments on the development data indicates that these simple heuristics slightly improves semantic parsing quality measured with labelled F1-score. It is possible that the improvement could be greater by using L2-regularised logistic regression scores instead of the SVM scores, since the latter can not be interpreted as probabilities. However, logistic regression performed consistently worse than the SVM formulation of Crammer and Singer in the argument labelling step. 2.2.3 Handling of multi-function arguments In Czech and Japanese an argument can have multiple relations to the same predicate, i.e. the semantic structure needs sometimes be represented by a multi-graph. I chose the simplest possible solution and treat these structures as ordinary graphs with complex labels. This solution is motivated by the fact that the palette of multi-function arguments is small, and that the multiple functions mostly are highly interdependent, such as in the ACT|PAT complex which is the most common in Czech."]},{"title":"3 Results","paragraphs":["The semantic parser was evaluated on in-domain","data for Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, German,","Japanese and Spanish, and on out-of-domain data","for Czech, English and German.

However, as discussed in the next section, simply adding more training data does not seem to solve the problem.","Comparing unlabelled F1-scores with labelled F1-scores, it seems that argument identification and labelling errors contribute almost equally to the total errors for Chinese, Czech and English. For Catalan, Spanish and German argument identification scores are high, while labelling scores are in the lower range. Japanese stands out with exceptionally low identification scores. Given that the quality of the predicted syntactic parsing was higher for Japanese than for any other language, the bottleneck when performing semantic parsing seems to be the limited expressivity of the Japanese syntactic dependency annotation scheme.","Interestingly, for Czech, the result on the out-of-domain data set is better than the result on the in-domain data set, even though the unlabelled result is slightly worse. For English, on the other hand the performance drop is in the order of 10 absolute labelled F1 points, while the drop in unlabelled F1-score is comparably small.

I suspect that this is due to a bug. 3.1 Learning rates In order to assess the effect of training set size on semantic parsing quality, I performed a learning rate experiment, in which the proportion of the training set used for training was varied in steps between 10% and 100% of the full training set size.","Learning rates with respect to labelled F1-scores are given in table 2. The improvement in scores are modest for Chinese, Czech, English and Japanese, while Catalan, German and Spanish stand out by vast improvements with additional training data. However, the improvement when going from 75% to 100% of the training data is only modest for all languages. With the exception for English, for which the parser achieves the highest score, the relative labelled F1-scores follow the relative sizes of the training sets.","Looking at learning rates with respect to unlabelled F1-scores, given in table 3, it is evident that adding more training data only has a minor effect on the identification of arguments.","From table 4, one can see that predicate sense disambiguation is the sub-task that benefits most from additional training data.

Training times are roughly ten times as long as compared to training times with no hyper-parameter optimisation.

The majority of the time in this step is, however, spent on writing the SVM training problems to disk.","Memory requirements range between approximately 1 Gigabytes for the smallest data sets and 6 Gigabytes for the largest data set.
