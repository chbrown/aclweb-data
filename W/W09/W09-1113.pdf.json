In the last few decades a great deal of experimental evidence has accumulated to suggest that the eye movements of readers are reflective of ongoing language processing and thus provide a useful source of information for making inferences about the linguistic processes involved in reading (Clifton et al., 2007). In psycholinguistic research, eye movement data is now commonly used to study how experimental manipulations of linguistic stimuli manifest themselves in the eye movement record.","Another related strand of research primarily at-tempts to understand what determines when and where the eyes move during reading. This line of research has led to mathematically well specified accounts of eye movement control in reading being instantiated as computational models (Legge et al., 1997; Reichle et al., 1998; Salvucci, 2001; Engbert et al., 2002; McDonald et al., 2005; Feng, 2006; Reilly and Radach, 2006; Yang, 2006). (For a recent overview, see (Reichle, 2006).) These models receive text as input and produce predictions for the location and duration of eye fixations, in approximation to human reading behavior. Although there are substantial differences between the various models, they typically combine both mechanisms of visuomotor control and linguistic processing. Two important points of divergence concern the extent to which language processing influences eye movements and whether readers process information from more than one word at a time (Starr and Rayner, 2001). More generally, the models that have emerged to date are based on different sets of assumptions about the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that control eye movements. The most influential model so far, the E-Z Reader model (Reichle et al., 1998; Reichle et al., 2003; Pollatsek et al., 2006), rests on the assumptions that cognitive / lexical processing is the engine that drives the eyes through the text and that words are identified serially, one at a time.","Although eye movement models typically have parameters that are fitted to empirical data sets, they are not based on machine learning in the standard sense and their predictions are hardly ever tested on unseen data. Moreover, their predictions are normally averaged over a whole group of readers or words belonging to a given frequency class. In this study, however, we investigate whether saccadic eye movements during reading can be modeled using machine learning. The task we propose is to learn to predict the eye movements of an individual reader reading a specific text, using as training data the eye 93 movements recorded for the same person reading other texts.","Predicting the eye movements of an individual reader on new texts is arguably a hard problem, and we therefore restrict the task to predicting word-based fixations (but not the duration of these fixations) and focus on a first pilot experiment investigating whether we can outperform a reasonable baseline on this task. More precisely, we present experimental results for a transition-based model, using a log-linear classifier, and show that the model significantly outperforms the baseline of always predicting the most frequent saccade. In addition, we show that even this simple model is able to capture frequency effects on eye movements observed in human readers.","We want to emphasize that the motivation for this modeling experiment is not to advance the state of the art in computational modeling of eye movements during reading. For this our model is far too crude and limited in scope. The goal is rather to propose a novel approach to the construction and evaluation of such models, based on machine learning and model assessment on unseen data. In doing this, we want to establish a reasonable baseline for future research by evaluating a simple model with a restricted set of features. In future studies, we intend to investigate how results can be improved by introducing more complex models as well as a richer feature space. More generally, the machine learning approach explored here places emphasis on modeling eye movement behavior with few a priori assumptions about underlying cognitive and physiological mechanisms.","The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background on basic characteristics of eye movements in reading. The emphasis is on saccadic eye movements rather than on temporal aspects of fixations. Section 3 defines the novel task of learning to predict fixations during reading and discusses different evaluation metrics for this task. Section 4 presents a transition-based model for solving this task, using a log-linear classifier to predict the most probable transition after each fixation. Section 5 presents experimental results for the model using data from the Dundee corpus (Kennedy and Pynte, 2005), and Section 6 contains conclusions and suggestions for future research."]},{"title":"2 Eye Movements in Reading","paragraphs":["Perhaps contrary to intuition, the eyes of readers do not move smoothly across a line or page of text. It is a salient fact in reading research that the eyes make a series of very rapid ballistic movements (called saccades) from one location to another. In between saccades, the eyes remain relatively stationary for brief periods of time (fixations). Most fixations last about 200-300 ms but there is considerable variability, both between and within readers. Thus, some fixations last under 100 ms while others last over 500 ms (Rayner, 1998). Much of the variability in fixation durations appears associated to processing ease or difficulty.","The number of characters that is within the region of effective vision on any fixation is known as the perceptual span. For English readers, the perceptual span extends approximately four characters to the left and fifteen characters to the right of the fixation. Although readers fixate most words in a text, many words are also skipped. Approximately 85% of the content words are fixated and 35% of the function words (Carpenter and Just, 1983). Variables known to influence the likelihood of skipping a word are word length, frequency and predictability. Thus, more frequent words in the language are skipped more often than less frequent words. This is true also when word length is controlled for. Similarly, words that occur in constrained contexts (and are thus more predictable) are skipped more often than words in less constrained contexts.","Although the majority of saccades in reading is relatively local, i.e., target nearby words, more distant saccades also occur. Most saccades move the eyes forward approximately 7–9 character spaces. Approximately 15% of the saccades, however, are regressions, in which the eyes move back to earlier parts of the text (Rayner, 1998). It has long been established that the length of saccades is influenced by both the length of the fixated word and the word to the right of the fixation (O’Regan, 1979). Regressions often go back one or two words, but occasionally they stretch further back. Such backward movements are often thought to reflect linguistic processing difficulty, e.g., because of syntactic parsing problems. Readers, however, are often unaware of making regressions, especially shorter ones. 94"]},{"title":"3 The Learning Task","paragraphs":["We define a text T as a sequence of word tokens (w1, . . . , wn), and we define a fixation sequence F for T as a sequence of token positions in T (i1, . . . , im) (1 < ik < n). The fixation set S(F ) corresponding to F is the set of token positions that occur in F . For example, the text Mary had a little lamb is represented by T = (Mary, had, a, little, lamb); a reading of this text where the sequence of fixations is Mary – little – Mary – lamb is represented by F = (1, 4, 1, 5); and the corresponding fixation set isS(F ) = {1, 4, 5}.","The task we now want to consider is the one of predicting the fixation sequence F for a specific reading event E involving person P reading text T . The training data consist of fixation sequences F1, . . . , Fk for reading events distinct from E involving the same person P but different texts T1, . . . , Tk. The performance of a model M is evaluated by comparing the predicted fixation sequence FM to the fixation sequenceFO observed in a reading experiment involving P and T . Here are some of the conceivable metrics for this evaluation:","1. Fixation sequence similarity: How similar are the sequences FM and FO, as measured, for example, by some string similarity metric?","2. Fixation accuracy: How large is the agreement between the sets S(FM ) and S(FO), as measured by 0-1-loss over the entire text, i.e., how large is the proportion of positions that are either in both S(FM ) and S(FO) (fixated tokens) or in neither (skipped tokens). This can also be broken down into precision and recall for fixated and skipped tokens, respectively.","3. Fixation distributions: Does the model predict the correct proportion of fixated and skipped tokens, as measured by the difference between |S(FM )|/|T | and |S(FO)|/|T |? This can also be broken down by frequency classes of words, to see if the model captures frequency effects reported in the literature. These evaluation metrics are ordered by an implicational scale from hardest to easiest. Thus, a model that correctly predicts the exact fixation sequence also makes correct predictions with respect to the set of words fixated and the number of words fixated (but not vice versa). In the same fashion, a model that correctly predicts which words are fixated (but not the exact sequence) also correctly predicts the number of words fixated.","In the experiments reported in Section 5, we will use variants of the latter two metrics and compare the performance of our model to the baseline of always predicting the most frequent type of saccade for the reader in question. We will report results both for individual readers and mean scores over all readers in the test set. The evaluation of fixation sequence similarity (the first type of metric) will be left for future work."]},{"title":"4 A Transition-Based Model","paragraphs":["When exploring a new task, we first have to decide what kind of model to use. As stated in the introduc-tion, we regard this as a pilot experiment to establish the feasibility of the task and have therefore chosen to start with one of the simplest models possible and see whether we can beat the baseline of always predicting the most frequent saccade. Since the task consists in predicting a sequence of different actions, it is very natural to use a transition-based model, with configurations representing fixation states and transitions representing saccadic movements. Given such a system, we can train a classifier to predict the next transition given the information in the current configuration. In order to derive a complete transition sequence, we start in an initial configuration, representing the reader’s state before the first fixation, and repeatedly apply the transition predicted by the classifier until we reach a terminal state, representing the reader’s state after having read the entire text. At an abstract level, this is essentially the same idea as in transition-based dependency parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2006; Attardi, 2006). In the following subsections, we discuss the different components of the model in turn, including the transition system, the classifier used, the features used to represent data, and the search algorithm used to derive complete transition sequences. 4.1 Transition System A transition system is an abstract machine consist-ing of a set of configurations and transitions between 95 configurations. A configuration in the current system is a triple C = (L, R, F ), where","1. L is a list of tokens representing the left context, including the currently fixated token and all preceding tokens in the text.","2. R is a list of tokens representing the right context, including all tokens following the currently fixated token in the text.","3. F is a list of token positions, representing the fixation sequence so far, including the currently fixated token. For example, if the text to be read is Mary had a little lamb, then the configuration ([Mary,had,a,little], [lamb], [1,4]) represents the state of a reader fixating the wordlittle after first having fixated the wordMary.","For any text T = w1 . . . wn, we define initial and terminal configurations as follows: 1. Initial: C = ([ ], [w1, . . . , wn], [ ])","2. Terminal: C = ([w1, . . . , wn], [ ], F ) (for any F ) We then define the following transitions:1","1. Progress(n): ([λ|wi], [wi+1, . . . , wi+n|ρ], [φ|i]) ⇒ ([λ|wi, wi+1, . . . , wi+n], ρ, [φ|i, i+n])","2. Regress(n): ([λ|wi−n, . . . , wi−1, wi], ρ, [φ|i]) ⇒ ([λ|wi−n], [wi−n+1, . . . , wi|ρ], [φ|i, i−n])","3. Refixate: ([λ|wi], ρ, [φ|i]) ⇒ ([λ|wi], ρ, [φ|i, i]) The transition Progress(n) models progressive saccades of length n, which means that the next fixated word is n positions forward with respect to the currently fixated word (i.e., n − 1 words are skipped). In a similar fashion, the transition Regress(n) models regressive saccades of length n. If the parameter","1","We use the variables λ, ρ and φ for arbitrary sublists of L, R and F , respectively, and we write the L and F lists with their tails to the right, to maintain the natural order of words. n of either Progress(n) or Regress(n) is greater than the number of words remaining in the relevant direction, then the longest possible movement is made instead, in which case Regress(n) leads to a terminal configuration while Progress(n) leads to a configuration that is similar to the initial configuration in that it has an empty L list. The transition Refixate, finally, models refixations, that is, cases where the next word fixated is the same as the current.","To illustrate how this system works, we may consider the transition sequence corresponding to the reading of the text Mary had a little lamb used as an example in Section 3:2 Init ⇒ ([ ], [Mary, . . . , lamb], [ ]) P(1) ⇒ ([Mary], [had, . . . , lamb], [1]) P(3) ⇒ ([Mary, . . . , little], [lamb], [1,4]) R(3) ⇒ ([Mary], [had, . . . , lamb], [1,4,1]) P(4) ⇒ ([Mary, . . . , lamb], [ ], [1,4,1,5]) 4.2 Learning Transitions The transition system defined in the previous section specifies the set of possible saccade transitions that can be executed during the reading of a text, but it does not say anything about the probability of different transitions in a given configuration, nor does it guarantee that a terminal configuration will ever be reached. The question is now whether we can learn to predict the most probable transition in such a way that the generated transition sequences model the behavior of a given reader. To do this we need to train a classifier that predicts the next transition for any configuration, using as training data the observed fixation sequences of a given reader. Before that, however, we need to decide on a feature representation for configurations.","Features used in this study are listed in Table 1. We use the notation L[i] to refer to the ith token in the list L and similarly for R and F . The first two features refer to properties of the currently fixated token. Length is simply the character length of the word, while frequency class is an index of the word’s frequency of occurrence in representative text. Word frequencies are based on occurrences in the Bristish National Corpus (BNC) and divided into 2 We abbreviate Progress(n) and Regress(n) to P(n) and","R(n), respectively. 96 Feature Description CURRENT.LENGTH The length of the token L[1] CURRENT.FREQUENCYCLASS The frequency class of the token L[1] NEXT.LENGTH The length of the token R[1] NEXT.FREQUENCYCLASS The frequency class of the token R[1] NEXTPLUSONE.LENGTH The length of the token R[2] NEXTPLUSTWO.LENGTH The length of the token R[3] DISTANCE.ONETOTWO The distance, in tokens, between F [1] and F [2] DISTANCE.TWOTOTHREE The distance, in tokens, between F [2] and F [3] Table 1: Features defined over fixation configurations. The notationL[i] is used to denote the ith element of list L. five classes. Frequencies were computed per million words in the ranges 1–10, 11–100, 101–1000, 1001– 10000, and more than 10000.","The next four features define features of tokens to the right of the current fixation. For the token immediately to the right, both length and frequency are recorded whereas only length is considered for the two following tokens. The last two features are defined over tokens in the fixation sequence built thus far and record the history of the two most recent saccade actions. The first of these (DISTANCE.ONETOTWO) defines the saccade distance, in number of tokens, that led up to the token currently being fixated. The second (DISTANCE.TWOTOTHREE), defines the next most recent saccade distance, that led up to the previous fixation. For these two features the following holds. If the distance is positive, the saccade is progressive, if the distance is negative, the saccade is regressive, and if the distance amounts to zero, the saccade is a refixation.","The small set of features used in the current model were chosen to reflect experimental evidence on eye movements in reading. Thus, for example, as noted in section 2, it is a well-documented fact that short, frequent and predictable words tend to be skipped. The last two features are included in the hope of capturing some of the dynamics in eye movement behavior, for example, if regressions are more likely to occur after longer progressive saccades, or if the next word is skipped more often if the current word is refixated. Still, it is clear that this is only a tiny subset of the feature space that might be considered, and it remains an important topic for future research to further explore this space and to study the impact of different features.","Given our feature representation, and given some training data derived from reading experiments, it is straightforward to train a classifier for predicting the most probable transition out of any configuration. There are many learning algorithms that could be used for this purpose, but in the pilot experiments we only make use of logistic regression. 4.3 Search Algorithm Once we have trained a classifierf that predicts the next transition f (C) out of any configurationC, we can simulate the eye movement behavior of a person reading the text T = (w1, . . . , wn) using the following simple search algorithm: 1. Initialize C to ([ ], [w1, . . . , wn], [ ]). 2. While C is not terminal, apply f (C) to C. 3. Return F of C. It is worth noting that search will always terminate once a terminal configuration has been reached, even though there is nothing in the transition system that forbids transitions out of terminal configurations. In other words, while the model itself allows regressions and refixations after the last word of the text has been fixated, the search algorithm does not. This seems like a reasonable approximation for this pilot study."]},{"title":"5 Experiments 5.1 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["The experiments we report are based on data from the English section of the Dundee corpus.

The corpus contains 20 texts, each of which were read by all participants. Participants also answered a set of multiple-choice comprehension questions after having finished reading each text. The corpus consists of 2379 sentences, 56212 tokens and 9776 types. The data was recorded using a Dr. Bouis Oculometer Eyetracker, sampling the position of the right eye every millisecond (see Kennedy and Pynte, 2005, for further details).","For the experiments reported here, the corpus was divided into three data sets: texts 1-16 for training (1911 sentences), texts 17-18 for development and validation (237 sentences), and the last two texts 19-20 for testing (231 sentences).","Since we want to learn to predict the observed saccade transition for any fixation configuration, where configurations are represented as feature vectors, it is not possible to use the eye tracking data directly as training and test data. Instead, we simulate the search algorithm on the corpus data of each reader in order to derive, for each sentence, the feature vectors over the configurations and the transitions corresponding to the observed fixation sequence. The instances to be classified then consist of feature representations of configurations while the classes are the possible transitions.","To somewhat simplify the learning task in this first study, we removed all instances of non-local saccades prior to training. Progressions stretching further than five words ahead of the current fixation were removed, as were regressions stretching further back than two words. Refixations were not removed. Thus we reduced the number of prediction classes to eight. Removal of the non-local saccade instances resulted in a 1.72% loss over the total number of instances in the training data for all readers.","We trained one classifier for each reader using logistic regression, as implemented in Weka (Witten and Eibe, 2005) and default options. In addition, we trained majority baseline classifiers for all readers. These models always predict the most frequent saccadic eye movement for a given reader.","The classifiers were evaluated with respect to the accuracy achieved when reading previously unseen text using the search algorithm in 4.3. To ensure that test data were consistent with training data, sentences including any saccade outside of the local range were removed prior to test. This resulted in removal of 18.9% of the total number of sentences in the test data for all readers. Accuracy was measured in three different ways. First, we computed the fixation accuracy, that is, the proportion of words that were correctly fixated or skipped by the model, which we also broke down into precision and recall for fixations and skips separately.3","Secondly, we compared the predicted fixation distribu-","3","Fixation/skip precision is the proportion of tokens fixated/skipped by the model that were also fixated/skipped by the reader; fixation/skip recall is the proportion of tokens fixated/skipped by the reader that were also fixated/skipped by the model. 98 tions to the observed fixation distributions, both over all words and broken down into the same five frequency classes that were used as features (see Section 4). The latter statistics, averaged over all readers, allow us to see whether the model correctly predicts the frequency effect discussed in section 2. 5.2 Results and Discussion Table 2 shows the fixation accuracy, and precision, recall and F1 for fixations and skips, for each of the ten different models and the average across all models (bottom row). Fixation accuracy is compared to the baseline of always predicting the most frequent saccade type (Progress(2) for readers a and e, and Progress(1) for the rest).","If we consider the fixation accuracy, we see that all models improve substantially on the baseline models. The mean difference between models and baselines is highly significant (p < .001, paired t-test). The relative improvement ranges from 4.4 percentage points in the worst case (model of reader f ) to 20.1 percentage points in the best case (model of reader e). The highest scoring model, the model of reader d, has an accuracy of 78.9%. The lowest scoring model, the model of reader g, has an accuracy of 56.6%. This is also the reader for whom there is the smallest number of sentences in the test data (129), which means that a large number of sentences were removed prior to testing because of the greater number of non-local saccades made by this reader. Thus, this reader has an unusually varied saccadic behaviour which is particularly hard to model.","Comparing the precision and recall for fixation and skips, we see that while precision tends to be about the same for both categories (with a few no-table exceptions), recall is consistently higher for fixations than for skips. We believe that this is due to a tendency of the model to overpredict fixations, especially for low-frequency words. This has a great impact on the F1 measure (unweighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), which is considerably higher for fixations than for skips.","Figure 1 shows the distributions of fixations grouped by reader and model. The models appear reasonably good at adapting to the empirical fixation distribution of individual readers. However, the models typically tend to look at more words than the readers, as noted above. This suggests that the models lack sufficient information to learn to skip words more often. This might be overcome by introducing features that further encourage skipping of words. In addition to word length and word frequency, that are already accounted for, n-gram probability could be included as a measure of predictability, for example.","We also note that there is a strong linear relation between the capability of fitting the empirical distribution well and achieving high fixation accuracy (Pearson’s r: -0.91, as measured by taking the differences of each pair of distributions and correlating them with the fixation accuracy of the models).","Figure 2 shows the mean observed and predicted fixation and skipping probability as a function of word frequency class, averaged over all readers. As seen here, model prediction is responsive to frequency class in a fashion comparable to the readers, although the predictions typically tend to exaggerate the observed frequency effect. In the lower to medium classes (1–3), almost every word is fixated. Then there is a clear drop in fixation probability for words in frequency class 4 which fits well with the observed fixation probability. Finally there is another drop in fixation probability for the most frequent words (5). The skipping probabilities for the different classes show the corresponding reverse trend."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have defined a new machine learning task where the goal is to learn the saccadic eye movement behavior of individual readers in order to predict the sequence of word fixations for novel reading events.

The evaluation shows that even this simple model, with features limited to a few relevant properties in a small context window, outperforms a majority baseline and captures some of the word frequency effects on eye movements observed in human readers.","This pilot study opens up a number of direc-tions for future research.

For example, given the sequential nature of the task, it seems natural to explore probabilistic sequence models such as HMMs (see for example Feng (2006)).

With respect to the task itself, we need to introduce additional aspects of the reading process, in particular the duration of fixations. By pursuing these lines of research, we should be able to gain a better understanding of how machine learning methods in eye movement modeling can inform and advance current theories and models in reading and psycholinguistic research. 100"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Giuseppe Attardi. 2006.
