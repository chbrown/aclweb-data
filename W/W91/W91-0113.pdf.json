The invention of unification grammar that allows for a declarative description of language made it possible to use the same grammar for both tasks. The main goal of a grammar then is to describe a relation between normalized (semantic) representations and language strings. A grammar that can be used in both di-rections is called \"reversible\".","We can distinguish three levels of reversibility. On the first level, not only the same grammar is used for parsing and generation, but also the in-terpreter for parsing and generation is reversible. This approach is taken in Shieber (1988). Besides elegance the approach has the advantage that the reversibility is guaranteed. Further advantages are mentioned in Neumann (1991). As a disadvantage, it is yet unclear whether and how these systems can be made efficient.","On the second level we find systems where the same reversible grammar is processed by two different interpreters, one for parsing, one for generation. The advantage of these systems is that the grammar can be changed and tested easily, which helps to shorten the development cycle. The disadvantage again is that grammar interpreters are usually too slow to be used in realistic systems.","On the third level we finally find systems, where the linguistic description is given in a reversible declarative grammar. This grammar is then compiled into two different forms, one being usefull only for parsing, the other only for generation. Whereas here we have to face the disadvantage that compiling can take some time and therefore prolongs the development cycle, the advantage lies in the efficient processing that can be achieved with compiled grammars. Strzalkowski (1990) and Strzalkowski/Peng (1990) describe a compiler that transforms a grammar originally written for parsing into an efficient generator.","In the follwing section I will present a system of the third type and show by means of which compiling methods a grammar written in a perspicious formalism, TRACE AND UNIFICATION GRAMMAR (TUG) can be transformed to fast parsers and generators. The proposed compilers and their modular architecture have the further advantage that most of their parts can be used also for other formalisms than the one described, e.g. DCGS.","The whole system is part of a polyfunctional linguistic processor for German called LINGUISTIC KERNEL PROCESSOR (LKP). The LKP contains a grammar of German with broad coverage. The grammar describes the relation between a subset of German and a subset of QLF, the intermediate semantic form that is used in the Care Language Engine of SRI Cambridge (Alshawi 1990). The LKP has been implemented in PROLOG. Parsing and Generation of a sentence up to 15 words normally takes between 1 and 10 seconds, with a strong tendency to the lower bound. i00"]},{"title":"2 FORMALISM","paragraphs":["The design of Trace and Unification Grammar has been guided by the following goals:","i","Â• Perspicuity. We are convinced that the generality, coverage , reliability and development speed of a grammar are a direct function of its perspicuity, just as programming in Pascal is less errorprone than programming in as-sembler. In the optimal case, the grammar writer shoul d be freed of reflections on how to code things best for processing but should only be guided by linguistic criteria. These goals led for .example to the introduction of unrestricted disjunction into the TUG formalism.","Â• Compatibility to GB Theory. It was a major objective bf the LKP to base the grammar on well undo;stood and motivated grounds. As most of the newer linguistic descriptions on German ate in the framework of GB theory, TUG was designed to be somehow compatible with this theory though it was not our goal to \"hardwire\" every Gs principle.","Â• Efficiency. :As the LKP is supposed to be the basis of products for interactive usage of natural langu~age, efficiency is a very important goal. Making efficiency a design goal of the formalism led e.g. to the introduction of feature types 'and the separation of the movement rules int~ head movement and argument movement.","The basis of TUG is formed by a context free grammar that is augmented by PATR n-style feature equations.
