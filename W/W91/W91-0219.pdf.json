Introduction","paragraphs":["A dictionary in which dependencies among 400,000 word senses of the English and Japanese languages are described in detail (Concept Dictionary) is being developed by EDR. The goal of the development is to build a neutral dictionary for natural language semantic processing that is available for various application systems. The implementation of the dictionary is based on several linguistic semantic representation theories. For a long time, a series of trials for describing dependencies among words or word senses by bundling verbs, adjectives, etc., has been conducted. Establishing a deep case level and using a formalism independent of each language, Fillmore developed a theory of representation of dependency among words (Fillmore 1968). On the other hand, Fodor and Katz explained a mechanism of selecting interpretations of constituents in a sentence by using a formalism composed of a semantic marker, distinguisher and selection restriction (Katz and Fodor 1963). In contrast to these theories, Wilks proposed a point of view to consider word dependency not as a constraint but as a preference (Wilks 1975). In addition, Schank proposed to abstract connotations not only from senses of nouns but also those of verbs, and he named them \"primitive actions\" (Schank 1975). These semantic representation theories have been reviewed and used in developing practical natural language processing systems (Nagao 1985, etc.). As such development of practical natural language processing systems progressed, the importance of accumulating lexJcal descriptions became recognized by developers of such systems. That is, a dictionary large enough in terms of both the granularity of semantic markers and the number of words or word senses became necessary to build. Against the background of the situation, the development of the Concept Dictionary began (Kakizaki 1987, Yokoi et. el. 1989, Uchida, 1990, MiikÂ¢ et. el. 1990a). The methodology of development of 206 the Concept Dictionary, which consists of a) concept descriptions, which represent dependencies among concepts and categories, and b) the concept taxonomy, which represent super-sub relations among concepts, is described in sections 2 and 3. Preference knowledge, which represents preference order of concept descriptions, is explained in section 4. in section 5, spheres of applications and limitations of the dictionary arc discussed."]},{"title":"2.

Secondly, (b) is the syntactic analysis section, where all binding relations among words has been analyzed.

I, the collected negative examples are translated to preference knowledge (for data structures and usages of preference knowledge, see Section 4). From a debugging trace of a testing system, together with a negative example, a concept, a word or a pronumciation corresponding to the negative example and a concept description more appropriate than the negative example must be also gained. This information is represented by preterence knowdedge with the following format 03) and accumulated:","(13) on <concept> I <word> I <pronunciation> give preference to","<a-more-appropriate-concept-description> over","<a-negative-example-of-.concept-description>","...","...........",".",".....","oo.. .........",".","............","( ~., 'r) ~.

The clustering algorithms are explained in detail in (Nakao 1988, Matsukawa 1989). 8) Reconstruction of the concept taxonomy Category-category relation descriptions are clustered and hierachized by using DM-decomposition and set-relation calculations in order to bundle the descriptions into higher level categories. The hierachization algorithm is explained in detail in (Matsukawa 1990a, 1990b, Yokola 1990)."]},{"title":"4 Preference Knowledge","paragraphs":["All concepts, categories and concept descriptions have an ID number called concept ID.
