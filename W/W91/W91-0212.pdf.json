Difficulties stemming from that assumption are sufficiently serious that they may require a re-evaluation of common notions about lexical representation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In a recent paper Boguraev and Levin (1990) point out inadequacies in common conceptions of what a Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) should be, inadequacies which stem from the assumption that a machine-readable dictionary (MRD) is not only the right source for acquisition of a lexicon but also the right model for its form. Their points about the kinds of generalizations that the standardly conceived LKB does not incorporate, especially if it is built from a dictionary source, are well-taken. They cite a need for the representation of various kinds of dynamic potential--specifically, the capacity to participate in predictable syntactic alternations and regular meaning extensions--which words of particular semantic classes possess in common, and which constitute the basis for lexical productivity. Representation of this kind of dynamic potential is missing from standard dictionaries, they suggest, because it is seen as being more predictable to a native speaker than are specific -nym relations. The same representation is missing from most LKBs both because it was not in the source dictionary and because it cannot be encoded in the usual LKB format. Boguraev and Levin conclude that tile conception of the LKB must be extended to include both representation of tile semantic classes whose members typically participate in these productive alternations and extensions, and sets of inference rules which capture the productive potential of members of those classes. They see this as a partial answer to the open-endedness problem; when a system of the sort they envision is given a new word, we need only specify its semantic class, and we will then have many aspects of both its syntactic and its meaning behavior in hand.","However perhaps a more serious difficulty arising from the adoption of the dictionary as model for the lexicon, and one which Boguraev and Levin do not discuss, is the implicit assumption that the level of the word, as structurally defined, is a semantically well-defined level also. 1 In the sections that follow, I will examine this assumption from several angles. Section 2 reviews the semantic behavior of what are structurally words,","1Boguraev and Levin do mention the possibility that generalizations of the sort they require may hold only over partial nodes in a lexicM network; this would seem to indicate that semantic classes may be defined in terms of bundles of features, only some of which might be relevant in determining the applicability of a given extension or alternation. 127 illustrating cases where it seems to take more than one \"word\" to make a single meaning, and where a single \"word\" is semantically decomposable into several meaning components. Section 3 discusses the problem of extricating a functor's argument requirements from other aspects of its meaning. In Section 4 the discussion turns to difficulties inherent in distinguishing individual word senses. Sections 5 explores some possibilities for escaping from the dictionary model and solving some of these problems."]},{"title":"2 Morphemes and \"Semantemes\"","paragraphs":["We are led as readers of English, and as dictionary users, to see white space between words as indicating a tangible boundary between units of some sort. We base much of our linguistic analysis on the assumption that there is such a thing as the \"word level\". If you go \"below\" this level of structure you are dealing with morphology or with lists of idiosyncratic information; \"above\" it is the level of syntax. Under this assumption semantics is also of two sorts: the largely classificatory operations of lexical semantics, and the compositional functions of syntactic structure-building. As a working assumption, this division of linguistic knowledge has some merit, and has allowed much useful work to proceed.","But in fact, even on the most superficial examination of real language, it is common to find gross disruptions of this convenient pattern. Unfortunately, lexicalization is an arbitrary process even within a single language, and it is probably only the merest accident when it happens that an atomic chunk of meaning is linked bi-uniquely to an invariant chunk of phonology. The more common run of structure-meaning correspondences are much more complicated.","For one thing, combinations of two or more surface words often function synchronically as more or less absolute semantic units. 2 These collocations may be able to be taken apart for syntactic purposes, but semantically they are not decomposable; they link to meanings which are more than, less than, or different from, the sum of the meanings of their individual parts. The commonly cited examples are phrasal verbs ('hold up', 'kid oneself' 'brim over with') and idiomatic expressions of various sorts ('house of cards', 'lie low', 'eat [someone] out of house and home'). The difficulties here, including locating the boundaries of true idiomaticity, are much discussed, and I will not dwell on them here.","Second, even what are structurally single words can exhibit the kind of compositionality ordinarily expected in syntactic constructions. The most interesting category here is that of lexicalized deverbal compounds, such as"]},{"title":"clambake, carwash, ill-advised,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"timesaving.","paragraphs":["Roeper and Siegel (1978), and Selkirk (1982), among others, have explored the compositional regularities found in this highly productive component of the lexicon, and found that the construction and interpretation of novel verbal compounds is constrained according to criteria whose canonical field of application is syntax.","Both these cross-over phenomena carl be accommodated structurally by means of an-alytical tricks of one sort or another. We have ways of representing verb-particle combinations, for example, so that they are looked up in the same fashion as structurally single words, even while their parts can be separated by theoretically indefinite stretches of the sentence. It is also possible to install vestiges of verbal structure into the representation of","2This is true even if we leave aside such trouhlesome orthographic conventions as the fact that fully lexicalized compounds are often written as separate words."]},{"title":"128","paragraphs":["derivationally deverbal items, so that the regularities which they exhibit in compounding are predicted.","A more severe problem than either of these for locating the \"level\" of the \"word\" is exemplified by these examples of perfectly legitimate paraphrase (from Talmy, 1985): be of interest to somebody = interest somebody carry out an investigation into something = investigate something Certainly we would want a natural language understanding system to arrive at the same conclusions from either variant in each pair. It is not at all clear, however, whether we should cause the single-word versions to be represented as decomposable into the phrasal expressions, or analyze the phrasal expressions as stylistically or pragmatically inspired expansions of the more succinct variants, or take some other other tack, such as just finding a way to list both variants as meaning the same thing. 3","Even when they are not so naturally expanded to phrasal versions, many--maybe most, depending on the granularity of the analysis-- of what we consider to be monomorphemic words have flagrantly compositional meanings; the most timeworn examples are kill (= 'cause-to-die') and other verbs in which a change-of-state (one meaning component) is brought about by a cause (the other meaning component). Accurate analysis of event descriptions containing such words would seem to require such sub-word semantic analysis, whether it is done as such or as an external listing of presuppositions and entailments of the description as a whole. The trouble, however, is sorting out some set of possible meaning components which is adequate to the compositional task and yet smaller (preferably both in cardinality and in size required for storage) than the set of English words.","Compare, for example, the pairs kill / murder and send_away / banish. Both pairs in-corporate an additional meaning element in the second word of each pair which is at least somewhat similar in both cases; it would mean something like 'with malice aforethought and with the intention of instituting a permanent solution to a perceived problem and probably done with heightened actional intensity'. It is possible that we could find other pairs of lexical expressions whose only difference in meaning is the presence of this additional element in one of them; this would be a good indication that a productive meaning component was at work. But if this component itself can only be expressed in English by means of a very long phrase, we have a considerable difficulty of representation.","It is not that the notions of \"word\" and \"morpheme\" make no sense, where the latter is defined as \"the minimal meaningful unit of language\" (Pei and Gaynor, 1980:140); rather, both are invaluable from the vantagepoint of surface structure. But when we use semantics instead as the starting point, and we define something called a \"semanteme\",4 say, as \"the minimal unit of meaning that has a sound\", then it is not at all clear that the two constructs would meet in the middle and we would arrive at the same set of words again.","Nor is this to say that the expanse of meaning encompassed by a structural word cannot be a unit. It must be true, as Jackendoff (1983, 1990) claims, that linguistic categories correspond fairly directly to conceptual categories. However his formulation of the mapping leaves the status of the structural word itself somewhat indeterminate: 3One of the pervasive fallacies inherent in the notion of the \"level\" of the \"word\" is that below this","everything must be listed, while above this level everything must be representable as sets of rules. 4 My apologies to anyone who has used this made-up term previously for a different purpose."]},{"title":"129","paragraphs":["Every content-bearing major phrasal constituent of a sentence (S, NP, AP, PP, etc.) corresponds to a conceptual constituent of some major conceptual category.

Attempts to assign thematic role structure to a wide range of verbs run immediately into two major problems. One is that, as Jackendoff (1990) points out, it may be only part of the meaning of a verb which is responsible for assigning a particular thematic role to a given argument. For instance, the verb pass (in the construction pass the house) is analyzed as incorporating a Path functor, similar in its function to a surface preposition by, which is part of the meaning of the verb. What appears in surface structure therefore as the object of pass is better analyzed semantically as the object of the underlying by; this is why there is no very satisfactory thematic role label for the object of pass. It is also possible for a verb to assign a role to only part of the referent of an argument. For example, the verb climb, in climb the mountain, has as its Goal not the mountain but only the top of the mountain. In general, Jackendoff's arguments that the standard conception of thematic roles requires an accompanying commitment to lexicai decomposition are difficult to refute.","At the same time, thematic role labels, or something like them, are necessary for the description of events whether we are willing to commit to lexical decomposition or not. The fact that the set of labels does not seem to be able to be cleanly inventoried at the level of the structural word does not change the fact that some such set of labels is necessary to let us individuate event types, that is, to distinguish events in which 'X verbs Y' from ones in which 'Y verbs X' (Carlson 1984). While we may not be able to arrive at a satisfactorily comprehensive set of labels without complete semantic decomposition, we must have a sufficient set to be able to extract the basic 'who did what to whom' structure from a sentence.","However, finding a boundary between the semantic contribution of the verb itself and that of its expected arguments is often practically impossible. Boguraev and Levin's contention that semantic class determines syntactic behavior, while arguable on other grounds, surely stems from the accurate observation that verbs which describe similar situations naturally tend to govern similar numbers of arguments in similar ways. 5 Par-","SUnfortunately, the arbitrariness of lexicalization rears its ugly head here also, and the notion of \"semantic class\" necessary to make this linkage between syntactic behavior and meaning may be somewhat circular; that is, in doubtful cases will we decide whether an item is a change-of-state verb on the basis of whether it undergoes the causative/inchoative alternation? Carlson and Tanenhaus (1988) would not have been able to construct their experiments comparing the effects of thematic structure ambiguity with those of semantic ambiguity, if there did not exist verbs of the same semantic class which do not share the same possibilities for thematic structure alternation. An example pair from their study is load / filh load / fill the truck (with bricks) load / *fill the bricks"]},{"title":"130","paragraphs":["ticularly where it is true that a whole semantic class of verbs exhibits similar syntactic behavior, it becomes extremely difficult to separate argument structure as an independent phenomenon from the core meaning,Sf there is such a thing, of the assigning verb. What would it mean to 'eat' without 'eating something' ?--it seems pointless even to consider such a question.","Even the definition of individual thematic roles is susceptible to influence from the meanings of expected fillers for those roles; this fact, along with the the difficulty of discovering how these roles are assigned to arguments by word-level functors, may help to explain the persistent lack of consensus on the proper set of thematic roles, as exemplified in Wilkins (1988) and elsewhere. Jackendoff faces one aspect of this problem by removing Agent from the set of primary thematic roles; rather, Agent and Patient are derived role types, designated on a separate Action Tier and superimposed on basic thematic structure through an interaction of the semantics of the verb and the nature of the entities filling potential Agent and Patient role slots.

In sentence (1), introduce comes closest to what we would probably call its core meaning, something like 'bring / put something into a new place'. Sentence (2) relocates this action in a different kind of space; both the Theme 'something' and the Goal 'new place' are abstract in this case. 7 In Sentence (3), the Goal location is some sort of recognition space, associated either with the recognizer or the subject matter; the effect is that Pete now knows about green chili. Obviously this sense extension for introduce only works if at least one of its arguments is an entity which is capable of recognizing, i.e. a person. Moreover, where the introduce-ee is also a person as in (4), (or where the single Object of introduce refers to more than one person) the introduction becomes reciprocal; the \"actional content\" of the verb, in Talmy's words, has been doubled.","In (5), the meaning extension present in (2), (3), and (4) is further specialized so that the implicit Goal location is not only a \"recognition space\", but is understood to be the recognition space belonging collectively to the individuals making up a market. We make this additional extension, however, not because we are now using a different sense of the verb introduce, but simply because of what we know about products. That is, our understanding of the type of space in which the introduction is effected is governed by both the core meaning of the verb--we know introduce means putting something into some space just as we know that eating means eating something--and the semantic content of its first argument.","In (6) the inference from 'product' to 'market' is reversed. In the most plausible reading of the sentence, the coyote refers generically to a decorative motif or to some kind of typically salable item, not to an actual animal. This is true because we know that Santa Fe stores represents a particular kind of market, and so we prefer an interpretation in which the thing introduced is something which can typically be marketed.","If we try to decide then what the senses of introduce are, as the dictionary model would suggest that we should do, we can take several tacks. We could just take a dictionary's word for the number and definitions of separate senses (leaving aside for the moment the problems of mapping between the different sense divisions of different dictionaries), but then we have clearly missed a generalization about the extensions of meaning possible for the verb introduce and others like it. We could distinguish separate senses on the basis of the use in some of the examples of into and in others of to, but that distinction cross-cuts what are clearly more important semantic distinctions.","On the basis of the thematic structure that the verb introduce instantiates, which is more or less the same for all six examples, we might say that it has only one sense, s","7This is a legitimate and extremely common meaning extension, from physical space to abstract space; in fact it is exactly the sort of regularity that a LKB should include among its lexical rules.","SThe one problematical construction here would be the one with a plural Theme and no explicit Goal, as in 'I introduced Joe and Pete.' In this case, as noted above, the introduction is reciprocal and therefore the thematic structure would apparently have to be copied over into another, simultaneous action."]},{"title":"133","paragraphs":["Likewise it would decompose in every case to something like CAUSE (GO (X (FROM (outside-some-space))(TO (inside-some-space))))","Under this analysis it is the characteristics of 'X', the locatum, and of the respective entities which serve as Goal that differentiate senses; sentence (1) makes reference to a real thing and a physical space, (2), (3), and (4) refer to recognizable entities and individual cognitive space, and (5) and (6) refer to something which can be sold and a particular kind of collective cognitive space. In (5), naming a product allows us to infer a market as the implicit Goal, while in (6) knowing that the Goal is a market lets us know that the coyote is to be construed as a product. What seems to be happening is what Cruse (1986) calls \"modulation\" of a word sense by context, except that in this case the \"context\" is an integral part of the argument structure of the verb.","In any case, it is clear that splitting the verb introduce into a set of separate senses at the word level will be arbitrary in one way or another."]},{"title":"5 Words as Worlds","paragraphs":["The ideal, but computationally outlandish, solution to this problem would be to represent every word in English (not just each functor, but every word) as the union of all the situations in which it could potentially participate, so that all the combinatorial potential of each word would be an inherent part of its inventory of meaning(s). Under this system, a structural word would just be the entry point into a rich representation which might or might not observe that bit of structure further, being built instead around the way the word works in combination with others. All lexical categories, not just the prototypical functors, would have combinatorial preferences, as McCawley (1986) suggests. Semantic composition of functor and arguments in a sentence then would consist of unifying these representations in the most cognitively perspicuous way, in accordance with the bounds imposed by syntax, to create a single coherent scene. In the process of unification, gaps would be filled, construals or views chosen in accordance with constraints instantiated by specific lexical interactions and general cognitive conventions, and aspects of the unifying representations which are contradictory or not currently in focus would fall away. A new semantic combination constructed in this way would be acceptable in inverse proportion to the strain which constructing it placed on these general conventions, and selectional restrictions would simply be statistically based thresholds of strain.","Various efforts have been made toward constructing a realistic version of this ambitious model. Raskin (1986) discusses a system he calls Script-based Semantics, which captures many of the ideas described above. In his system, the appearance of a word in a sentence being analyzed evokes both a set of syntactic senses and one or more scripts, where a script is defined as \"a large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word or evoked by it ... a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker, [representing] knowledge of a small part of the world. ~ These scripts are represented as graphs with lexical nodes and semantic relation arcs, thus bearing a strong resemblance to tile Conceptual Structures of Sowa (1984). Under both schemes a set of combinatorial rules then unifies graphs in such a way that ambiguity between word senses disappears and a complete representation for a sentence is constructed.","What is not clear in either system is where the graphs for individual word senses come from.

Practitioners of this approach have sometimes apologized for it (see for instance Pazienza and Velardi, 1989) as a practical but unprincipled substitute for \"real\" semantics.

The matching of partially disambiguated, intermediate sentence graphs constructed at the first level against an inventory of highly schematic \"entry\" graphs, and then against successive layers of more completely specified model graphs, would funnel the analysis through the next levels of lookup. 9 A system of semantic classes, along with a set of redundancy rules encoding systematic relations between and alternations possible for members of those classes, would constitute yet another level of lexical knowledge; this level would be important in the organization of the lexicon, but might be accessed directly during lookup only ill the case of the appearance of previously unknown words.","How would we construct this kind of multi-level lexical knowledge base?

Our idea is that the graded levels of specificity would be constructed by means of successive generalization operations over the most specific set of graphs, extracted more or less directly from text.

This discussion has also revealed a further detrimental assumption fostered by the use of the dictionary as the model for the lexicon: the idea that a single store of lexical knowledge, with a single lookup function and a unified structure, is the necessary mechanism for bringing word meanings into sentence analysis. On the contrary, the multi-faceted semantic behavior of the structural units we call \"words\" requires a base of knowledge consisting of multiple knowledge stores, each organized in a way that is appropriate to the knowledge it contains and the stage of processing to which it must contribute. The structural word can be used as the indexing key which relates the separate, differently structured stores, but it need not be the basic currency of all of \"lexical\" semantics.","9 One or more of these levels of distillation would presumably be equivalent to the single set of canonical graphs envisioned by Sowa (1984)."]},{"title":"136 References [1] Boguraev, Bran, and Beth Levin (1990). \"Models for lexical knowledge bases\", in Electronic Text Research: Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Conference of the UW Centre for the New OED, pp. 65-78.
