{"sections":[{"title":"PREFACE","paragraphs":["This year’s workshop is special. First, Sighan organized the First Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, and this workshop will include presentations from the participating sites and discussion about the bakeoff and further contests. Second, many of us have been affected one way or another by SARS in the past half year. It is important to keep carrying out our research while helping our countries and people to get through the tough time.","Our first thanks go to Sighan and ACL for sponsoring the workshop. We would also like to thank all those who submitted their work to the workshop and who participated in the Word Segmentation Bakeoff. In total, we received twenty-nine workshop papers, and thirteen sites from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and United States participated in the bakeoff.","Richard Sproat has put tremendous effort in organizing the bakeoff. We would also like to thank the four sites (Academia Sinica, the City University of Hong Kong, Peking University, and the University of Pennsylvania) for providing the training and testing data, and Tom Emerson for maintaining the workshop and bakeoff websites.","Our programming committee has done a terrific job, considering the problems caused by SARS in Asia, and the short time span between the submission deadline and the time of acceptance notices.","In closing we would like to thank you for attending the workshop, and we wish you have a great time at the workshop.
