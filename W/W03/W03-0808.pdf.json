This paper focuses on IE tasks designed to support information discovery applications. Since information discovery implies examining large volumes of documents drawn from various sources for situations that cannot be anticipated a priori, they require IE systems to have breadth as well as depth. This implies the need for a domain-independent IE system that can easily be customized for specific domains: end users must be given tools to customize the system on their own. It also implies the need for defining new intermediate level IE tasks that are richer than the subject-verb-object (SVO) triples produced by shallow systems, yet not as complex as the domain-specific scenarios defined by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC). This paper describes a robust, scalable IE engine designed for such purposes. It describes new IE tasks such as entity profiles, and concept-based general events which represent realistic goals in terms of what can be accomplished in the near-term as well as providing useful, actionable information. These new tasks also facilitate the correlation of output from an IE engine with existing structured data. Benchmarking results for the core engine and applications utilizing the engine are presented."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper focuses on new intermediate level information extraction tasks that are defined and implemented in an IE engine, named InfoXtract. InfoXtract is a domain independent, but portable information extraction engine that has been designed for information discovery applications.","The last decade has seen great advances in the area of IE. In the US, MUC [Chinchor & Marsh 1998] has been the driving force for developing this technology.","The most successful IE task thus far has been Named Entity (NE) tagging. The state-of-the-art exemplified by systems such as NetOwl [Krupka & Hausman 1998], IdentiFinder [Miller et al 1998] and InfoXtract [Srihari et al 2000] has reached near human performance, with 90% or above F-measure. On the other hand, the deep level MUC IE task Scenario Template (ST) is designed to extract detailed information for predefined event scenarios of interest. It involves filling the slots of complicated templates. It is generally felt that this task is too ambitious for commercial application at present.","Information Discovery (ID) is a term which has traditionally been used to describe efforts in data mining [Han 1999]. The goal is to extract novel patterns of transactions which may reveal interesting trends. The key assumption is that the data is already in a structured form. ID in this paper is defined within the context of unstructured text documents; it is the ability to extract, normalize/disambiguate, merge and link entities, relationships, and events which provides significant support for ID applications. Furthermore, there is a need to accumulate information across documents about entities and events. Due to rapidly changing events in the real world, what is of no interest one day, may be especially interesting the following day. Thus, information discovery applications demand breadth and depth in IE technology.","A variety of IE engines, reflecting various goals in terms of extraction as well as architectures are now available. Among these, the most widely used are the GATE system from the University of Sheffield [Cunningham et al 2003], the IE components from Clearforest (www.clearforest.com), SIFT from BBN [Miller et al 1998], REES from SRA [Aone & Ramon-Santacruz 1998] and various tools provided by Inxight (www.inxight.com). Of these, the GATE system most closely resembles InfoXtract in terms of its goals as well as the architecture and customization tools. Cymfony differentiates itself by using a hybrid   model that efficiently combines statistical and grammar-based approaches, as well as by using an internal data structure known as a token-list that can represent hierarchical linguistic structures and IE results for multiple modules to work on.","The research presented here focuses on a new intermediate level of information extraction which supports information discovery. Specifically, it defines new IE tasks such as Entity Profile (EP) extraction, which is designed to accumulate interesting information about an entity across documents as well as within a discourse. Furthermore, Concept-based General Event (CGE) is defined as a domain-independent, representation of event information but more feasible than MUC ST.","InfoXtract represents a hybrid model for extracting both shallow and intermediate level IE: it exploits both statistical and grammar-based paradigms. A key feature is the ability to rapidly customize the IE engine for a specific domain and application. Information discovery applications are required to process an enormous volume of documents, and hence any IE engine must be able to scale up in terms of processing speed and robustness; the design and architecture of InfoXtract reflect this need.","In the remaining text, Section 2 defines the new intermediate level IE tasks. Section 3 presents extensions to InfoXtract to support cross-document IE. Section 4 presents the hybrid technology. Section 5 delves into the engineering architecture and implementation of InfoXtract. Section 6 discusses domain porting. Section 7 presents two applications which have exploited InfoXtract, and finally, Section 8 summarizes the research contributions."]},{"title":"2 InfoXtract: Defining New IE Tasks","paragraphs":["InfoXtract [Li & Srihari 2003, Srihari et al 2000] is a","domain-independent and domain-portable, inter-","mediate level IE engine. Figure 1 illustrates the","overall architecture of the engine. A description of the increasingly sophisticated IE","outputs from the InfoXtract engine is given below: ","• NE: Named Entity objects represent key items such as proper names of person, organization, product, location, target, contact information such as address, email, phone number, URL, time and numerical expressions such as date, year and various measurements weight, money, percentage, etc.","• CE: Correlated Entity objects capture relationship mentions between entities such as the affiliation relationship between a person and his employer. The results will be consolidated into the information object Entity Profile (EP) based on co-reference and alias support.","• EP: Entity Profiles are complex rich information objects that collect entity-centric information, in particular, all the CE relationships that a given entity is involved in and all the events this entity is involved in. This is achieved through document-internal fusion and cross-document fusion of related information based on support from co-reference, including alias association. Work is in progress to enhance the fusion by correlating the extracted information with information in a user-provided existing database.","• GE: General Events are verb-centric information objects representing ‘who did what to whom when and where’ at the logical level. Concept-based GE (CGE) further requires that participants of events be filled by EPs instead of NEs and that other values of the GE slots (the action, time and location) be disambiguated and normalized.","• PE: Predefined Events are domain specific or user-defined events of a specific event type, such as Product Launch and Company Acquisition in the business domain. They represent a simplified version of MUC ST. InfoXtract provides a toolkit that allows users to define and write their own PEs based on automatically generated PE rule templates.  The InfoXtract engine has been deployed both internally to support Cymfony’s Brand DashboardTM product and externally to a third-party integrator for building IE applications in the intelligence domain.

Achieving the right balance of these two paradigms is a major design objective of InfoXtract. The core of the parsing and information extraction process in InfoXtract is organized very simply as a pipeline of processing modules. All modules operate on a single in-memory data structure, called a token list. A token list is essentially a sequence of tree structures, overlaid with a graph whose edges define relations that may be either grammatical or informational in nature. The nodes of these trees are called tokens. InfoXtract’s typical mode of processing is to skim along the roots of the trees in the token list, building up structure “strip-wise”. So even non-terminal nodes behave, in the typical case, as complex tokens. Representing a marked up text using trees explicitly, rather than implicitly as an interpretation of paired bracket symbols, has several advantages. For example, it allows a somewhat richer organization of the information contained “between the brackets,” allowing us to construct direct links from a root node to its semantic head, for example.","The processing modules that act on token lists can range from lexical lookup to the application of hand written grammars to statistical analysis based on machine learning all the way to arbitrary procedures written in C++. The configuration of the InfoXtract processing pipeline is controlled by a configuration file, which handles pre-loading required resources as well as ordering the application of modules. Despite the variety of implementation strategies available, InfoXtract Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules are restricted in what they can do to the token list to actions of the following three types :"," 1. Assertion and erasure of token properties","(features, normal forms, etc.) 2. Grouping token sequences into higher level","constituent tokens. 3. Linking token pairs with a relational link.  Grammatical analysis of the input text makes use of a combination of phrase structure and relational approaches to grammar. Basically, early modules build up structure to a certain level (including relatively simple noun phrases, verb groups and prepositional phrases), after which further grammatical structure is represented by asserting relational links between tokens. This mix of phrase structural and relational approaches is very similar to the approach of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Kaplan & Bresnan 1982], much scaled down.","Our grammars are written in a formalism developed for our own use, and also in a modified formalism developed for outside users, based on our in-house experiences. In both cases, the formalism mixes regular expressions with boolean expressions. Actions affecting the token list are implemented as side effects of pattern matching. So although our processing modules are in the technical sense token list transducers, they do not resemble Finite State Transducers (FSTs) so much as the regular expression based pattern-action rules used in Awk or Lex. Grammars can contain (non-recursive) macros, with parameters.","This means that some long-distance dependencies, which are very awkward to represent directly in finite state automata can be represented very compactly in macro form. While this has the advantage of decreasing grammar sizes, it does increase the size of the resulting automata. Grammars are compiled to a special type of finite state automata. These token list automata can be thought of as an extension of tree walking automata [Mönnich et al 2001, Aho & Ullman 1971, Engelfriet et al 1999]. These are linear automata (as opposed to standard finite state tree automata [Gécseg & Steinby 1997], which are more naturally thought of as parallel) which run over trees. The problem with linear automata on trees is that there can be a number of “next” nodes to move the read head to: right sister, left sister, parent, first child, etc. So the vocabulary of the automaton is increased to include not only symbols that might appear in the text (test instructions) but also symbols that indicate where to move the read head (directive instructions). We have extended the basic tree walking formalism in several directions. First we extend the power of test instructions to allow them to check features of the current node and to perform string matching against the semantic head of the current node (so that a syntactically complex constituent can be matched against a single word). Second, we include symbols for action instructions, to implement side effects. Finally, we allow movement not only along the root sequence (string-automaton style) and branches of a tree (tree-walking style) but also along the the terminal frontier of the tree and along relational links.","These extensions to standard tree walking automata extend the power of that formalism tremendously, and could pose problems. However, the grammar formalisms that compile into these token list walking automata are restrictive, in the sense that there exist many token list transductions that are implementable as automata that are not implementable as grammars. Also the nature of the shallow parsing task itself is such that we only need to dip into the reserves of power that this representation affords us on relatively rare occasions. As a result, the automata that we actually plug into the InfoXtract NLP pipeline generally run very fast.","Recently, we have developed an extended finite state formalism named Expert Lexicon, following the general trend of lexicalist approaches to NLP. An   expert lexicon rule consists of both grammatical components as well as proximity-based keyword matching. All Expert Lexicon entries are indexed, similar to the case for the finite state tool in INTEX [Silberztein 2000]. The pattern matching time is therefore reduced dramatically compared to a sequential finite state device.","Some unique features of this formalism include: (i) the flexibility of inserting any number of Expert Lexicons at any level of the process; (ii) the capability of proximity checking within a window size as rule constraints in addition to pattern matching using an FST call, so that the rule writer can exploit the combined advantages of both; and (iii) support for the propagation of semantic tagging results, to accommodate principles like one sense per discourse. Expert lexicons are used in customization of lexicons, named entity glossaries, and alias lists, as well as concept tagging.","Both supervised machine learning and unsupervised learning are used in InfoXtract. Supervised learning is used in hybrid modules such as NE [Srihari et al 2000], NE Normalization [Li et al 2002] and Co-reference. It is also used in the preprocessing module for orthographic case restoration of case insensitive input [Niu et al 2003]. Unsupervised learning involves acquisition of lexical knowledge and rules from a raw corpus. The former includes word clustering, automatic name glossary acquisition and thesaurus construction. The latter involves bootstrapped learning of NE and CE rules, similar to the techniques used in [Riloff 1996]. The results of unsupervised learning can be post-edited and added as additional resources for InfoXtract processing.

InfoXtract provides the ability to create customized named entity glossaries, which will boost the performance of organization tagging for a given domain. No such customization was done in the testing just described. The accuracy of shallow parsing is well over 90% reflecting very high performance part-of-speech tagging and named entity tagging.

The system has been tested on very large (> 1 million) document collections. The architecture facilitates the incorporation of the engine into external applications requiring an IE subsystem. Requests to process documents can be submitted through a web interface, or via FTP. The results of processing a document can be returned in XML. Since various tools are available to automatically populate databases based on XML data models, the results are easily usable in web-enabled database applications. Configuration files enable the system to be used with different lexical/statistical/grammar resources, as well as with subsets of the available IE modules.","InfoXtract supports two modes of operation, active and passive. It can act as an active retriever of documents to process or act as a passive receiver of documents to process. When in active mode, InfoXtract is capable of retrieving documents via HTTP, FTP, or local file system. When in passive mode, InfoXtract is capable of accepting documents via HTTP.

The Processors can be running on a single server (if multiple CPUs are available) and on multiple servers. The Document Manager distributes requests to process documents to all available Processors. Each component is an independent application. All direct   inter-module communication is accomplished using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). CORBA provides a robust, programming language independent, and platform neutral mechanism for developing and deploying distributed applications. Processors can be added and removed without stopping the InfoXTract engine. All modules are self-registering and will announce their presence to other modules once they have completed initialization.","The Document Retriever module is only used in the active retriever mode. It is responsible for retrieving documents from a content provider and storing the documents for use by the InfoXtract Controller. The Document Retriever handles all interfacing with the content provider’s retrieval process, including interface protocol (authentication, retrieve requests, etc.), throughput management, and document packaging. It is tested to be able to retrieve documents from content providers such as Northern Light, Factiva, and LexisNexis. Since the Document Retriever and the InfoXtract Controller do not communicate directly, it is possible to run the Document Retriever standalone and process all retrieved documents in a batch mode at a later time.","The InfoXtract Controller module is used only in the active retriever mode. It is responsible for retrieving documents to be processed, submitting documents for processing, storing extracted information, and system logging. The InfoXtract Controller is a multi-threaded application that is capable of submitting multiple simultaneous requests to the Document Manager. As processing results are returned, they are stored to a repository or database, an XML file, or both.","The Document Manager module is responsible for managing document submission to available Processors. As Processors are initialized, they register with the Document Manager. The Document Manager uses a round robin scheduling algorithm for sending documents to available Processors. A document queue is maintained with a size of four documents per Processor. The Processor module forms the core of the IE engine. InfoXtract utilizes a multi-level approach to NLP. Each level utilizes the results of the previous levels in order to achieve more sophisticated parsing. The JIX module is a web application that is responsible for accepting requests for documents to be processed. This module is only used in the passive mode. The document requests are received via the HTTP Post request. Processing results are returned in XML format via the HTTP Post response.","In Table 2 we present an example of the performance that can be expected based on the application of all modules within the engine. It should be noted that considerably faster processing per processor can be achieved if output is restricted to a certain IE level, such as named entity tagging only. The output in this benchmark includes all major tasks such as NE, EP, parsing and event extraction as well as XML generation.","This configuration provides throughput of approximately 12,000 documents (avg. 10KB) per day. A smaller average document size will increase the document throughput. Increased throughput can be achieved by dedicating a CPU for each running Processor. Each Processor instance requires approximately 500 MB of RAM to run efficiently. Processing speed increases linearly with additional Processors/CPUs, and CPU speed. In the current state, with no speed optimization, using a bank of eight processors, it is able to process approximately 100,000 documents per day. Thus, InfoXtract is suitable for high volume deployments. The use of CORBA provides seamless inter-process and over-the-wire communication between modules. Computing resources can be dynamically assigned to handle increases in document volume.",""]},{"title":"Table 2: Benchmark for Efficiency","paragraphs":["Server Configuration","2 CPU @ 1 GHz, 2 GB","RAM Operating System Redhat Linux 7.2 Document Collection Size 500 Documents, 5 MB total size Engine Configuration InfoXtract Controller, Document Manager, and 2 Processors running on a single server","Processing Time 30 Minutes","","A standard document input model is used to develop effective preprocessing capabilities. Preprocessing adapts the engine to the source by presenting metadata, zoning information in a standardized format and performing restoration tasks (e.g. case restoration). Efforts are underway to configure the engine such that zone-specific processing controls are enabled. For example, zones identified as titles or subtitles must be tagged using different criteria than running text. The engine has been deployed on a variety of input formats including HUMINT documents (all uppercase), the Foreign Broadcast Information Services feed (FBIS), live feeds from content providers such as Factiva (Dow Jones/Reuters), LexisNexis, as well as web pages. A user-trainable, high-performance case restoration module [Niu et al 2003] has been developed that transforms case insensitive input such as speech transcripts into mixed-case before being processed by the engine. The case restoration module eliminates the need for separate IE engines for case-insensitive and case-sensitive documents; this is easier and more cost effective to maintain.  "]},{"title":"5 Corpus-level IE","paragraphs":["Efforts have extended IE from the document level to the corpus level. Although most IE systems perform corpus-level information consolidation at an application level, it is felt that much can be gained by doing this as an extended step in the IE engine. A repository has been developed for InfoXtract that is able to hold the results of processing an entire corpus. A proprietary indexing scheme for indexing token-list data has been developed that enables querying over both the linguistic structures as well as statistical similarity queries (e.g., the similarity between two documents or two entity profiles). The repository is used by a fusion module in order to generate cross-document entity profiles as well as for text mining operations. The results of the repository module can be subsequently fed into a relational database to support applications. This has the advantage of filtering much of the noise from the engine level and doing sophisticated information consolidation before populating a relational database. The architecture of these subsequent stages is shown in Figure 3.

Even with modest recall, the corpus-level EP demonstrates tremendous value in collecting information about an entity.

This has resulted in a development/customization environment known as the Lexicon Grammar Development Environment (LGDE). The LGDE permits users to modify named entity glossaries, alias lexicons and general-purpose lexicons. It also supports example-based grammar writing; users can find events of interest in sample documents, process these through InfoXtract and modify the constraints in the automatically generated rule templates for event detection. With some basic training, users can easily use the LGDE to customize InfoXtract for their applications. This facilitates customization of the system in user applications where access to the input data to InfoXtract is restricted.

The InfoXtract engine is used to analyze several thousand electronic sources of information provided by various content aggregators (Factiva, LexisNexis, etc.). The engine is focused on tagging and generating brand profiles that also capture salient information such as the descriptive phrases used in describing brands (e.g. cost-saving, non-habit forming) as well as user-configurable specific messages that companies are trying to promote and track (safe and reliable, industry leader, etc.). The output from the engine is fed into a database-driven web application which then produces report cards for brands containing quantitative metrics pertaining to brand perception, as well as qualitative information describing characteristics. A sample screenshot from Brand Dashboard is presented in Figure 5. It depicts a report card for a particular brand, highlighting brand strength as well as highlighting metrics that have changed the most in the last time period. The “buzz box” on the right hand side illustrates companies/brands, people, analysts, and messages most frequently associated with the brand in question."]},{"title":"Figure 5: Report Card from Brand Dashboard 8 Summary and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper has described the motivation behind InfoXtract, a domain independent, portable, intermediate-level IE engine. It has also discussed the architecture of the engine, both from an algorithmic perspective and software engineering perspective. Current efforts to improve InfoXtract include the following: support for more diverse input formats, more use of metadata in the extraction tasks, support    for structured data, and capabilities for processing foreign languages. Finally, support for more intuitive domain customization tools, especially the semi-automatic learning tools is a major focus."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors wish to thank Carrie Pine of AFRL for reviewing and supporting this work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Aho & Ullman 1971] Alfred V.
