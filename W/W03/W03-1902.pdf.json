Our focus has been the study of coreference. In the study of coreference we have dealt with annotation experiments (manual and automatic) and their respective annotation schemes. To work on coreference we used information from syntactic annotated corpus, the Penn Treebank. Our results (annotated corpus with coreference links and classification of coreference status) were Prolog encoded. When we first adapted our tool for Portuguese (Rossi et al., 2001) we dealt with other tools and annotation formats. The resources built on these previous works were difficult to share due to their particular information encoding.","Our current work in the COMMOn-REFs project (A computational model for processing referring expressions)1",", involves Portuguese and French. We","1","http://www.inf.unisinos.br/ renata/documents/commonrefsproposal.pdf. Research Grant CNPq- Brazil. are using MMAX, a tool for multimodal annotation in XML (Müller and Strube, 2001), for manual annotation of coreference, and we are developing a tool for automatic coreference resolution. Our tool deals with XML encoding provided by MMAX and syntactic information for Portuguese and French encoded in XML. In order to be able to share the resources being built, we are relating our model with proposed standards.","In Section 2 we present previous annotation formats that we dealt with. In Section 3 we give an overview of the work in COMMOn-REFs. Section 4 relates our current model with the standards recently proposed (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). Section 5 describes our tool for coreference resolution. A discussion on the problems we face with our annotation model is presented in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Previous work","paragraphs":["Our first annotation schemes were Prolog lists of treebank sentences and their noun phrases (NPs), as shown in Figure 1. The lists were extracted from Lisp lists of the Penn Treebank. These lists were manipulated in our experiments on coreference annotation and resolution.","The results of coreference annotation were lists of Prolog facts dcc(Index1,Index2,Code) as shown in Figure 2. Index1 refers to the sequential numbering of definite descriptions; Index2 refers to the sequential numbering of noun phrases; and Code refers to their classification, according to discourse status (Poesio and Vieira, 1998). For some of them there were also facts [S,[NP,the,squabbling,[PP,within,[NP,the, Organization,[PP,of,[NP,Petroleum,Exporting, Countries]]]]],[VP,seems,[PP,under, [NP,control]],[PP,for,now]].].

Figure 2: Prolog coreference annotation. ddsr(Index1,Index2,Code,Antecedent) indicating their antecedent NPs. We could only link the annotation to the data by running the Prolog code that loaded the lists of NPs and sentences and generated their indexes. Although we had carried out intensive research with these resources and tools, the re-use of our data in other environments was very difficult.","Despite the lack of fully annotated data for Portuguese, we tried to check out whether the same heuristics we used for English would be suitable for this new language. To test our heuristics we used the PALAVRAS parser2","(Bick, 2000) to parse Portuguese corpus. From parsed texts we extracted Prolog lists of NPs as illustrated in Figure 3. Experiments were carried out over these resources. Heuristics for correference resolution were adapted to Portuguese and the results obtained were comparable to those previously obtained for English. However, the genericity of the Portuguese resolver and annotated data still raised the same re-usability problems as for English, since the encoding format had not evolved."]},{"title":"3 COMMOn-REFs","paragraphs":["In the COMMOn-REFs project we face the challenge of dealing with different languages (French 2 http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/pt STA:fcl P:v-fin(’ser’ PR 3P IND) São SC:adj(’remoto’ F P) remotas SUBJ:np =>N:art(’o’ <artd> F P) as =H:n(’chance’ F P) chances =N<:pp ==H:prp(’de’) de ==P<:np ===H:n(’aprovação’ F S) aprovação ....

Therefore, we have to share corpora and tools, initially available under different formats.","We adopted MMAX3","as our manual annotation tool. With MMAX we could annotate our corpus according to our theoretical principles. The following corpus studies were developed with the aid of the tool: (Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002; Vieira et al., 2002b; Vieira et al., 2002a). In these studies, our annotation targets were manually marked and coreference information was added to them according to subjects’ analysis of the texts.","We are currently developing a coreference resolution tool on the basis of XML filesand XSL scripts. The tool manipulates several levels of linguistic information. Parsing information has been provided by the PALAVRAS parser. The parser output is transformed into two XML files: one with POS and another with syntactic information (chunks). Coreference information, manually annotated with MMAX (markables), is used for evaluation. Our tool, besides manipulating three different annotation levels (POS, chunks, markables), creates two others: anaphors and candidates, as detailed in Section 5.","As we are interested in having our resources made available, we relate our annotation schemes to standard proposals presented in (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). 3 The MMAX tool is available for download in","http://www.eml.org/english/Research/NLP/Downloads.","<markables>","... <markable id=\"markable_1\" coref=\"no\" classif=\"disc_stat_1\" span=\"word_1..word_2\" />","...","<markable id=\"markable_3\" coref=\"yes\" pointer=\"markable_1\" classif=\"disc_stat_2\" span=\"word_8\" /> ... </markables>","<struct type=\"CRAnnot\">","... <struct id=\"m1\" type=\"C-level\">","<feat type=\"coref\">no</feat>","<feat type=\"classif\">disc_stat_1</feat>","<feat type=\"target\">#w1 #w3</feat> </struct> <struct id=\"m3\" type=\"C-level\">","<feat type=\"coref\">yes</feat>","<feat type=\"pointer\">#m1</feat>","<feat type=\"classif\">disc_stat_2</feat>","<feat type=\"target\">#w8</feat> </struct>","...","</struct>","(a) (b) Figure 5: Markables file.","<words> <word id=\"word_1\">O</word> <word id=\"word_2\">jogador</word> <word id=\"word_3\">pode</word> <word id=\"word_4\">deixar</word> <word id=\"word_5\">o</word> <word id=\"word_6\">time</word> <word id=\"word_7\">.</word> <word id=\"word_8\">Ele</word> <word id=\"word_9\">recebeu</word> <word id=\"word_10\">uma</word> <word id=\"word_11\">proposta</word> <word id=\"word_10\">excelente</word> <word id=\"word_11\">.</word>","</words> Figure 4: Words file."]},{"title":"4 Data model 4.1 Encoding standards","paragraphs":["Directions for standard corpus encoding in XML have been proposed in (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). Such efforts consist on defining abstract formats for corpus annotation that could be instantiated according to specific project requirements. An abstract XML file can be generated for each annotation level according to a Virtual Annotation Markup Language (VAML). The structure of this language is defined by a skeleton that consists on <struct> (a node/level in the annotation) and <feat> elements (feature at-tached to the enclosing <struct> node).","Particular project specifications are defined through data categories (component categories to be annotated) and dialect (encoding style). On the basis of these specifications, a mapping between VAML and Concrete AML (CAML) can be made. CAML is the language used for annotation encoding in particular projects. 4.2 Our schemes Our first experiments with MMAX were on manual coreference annotation. The tool required specific input and output formats. Our corpus, that is, the primary data, were firstconverted from raw texts to XML, encoded as <word> elements, like the example in Figure 4 for the sentences O jogador pode deixar o time. Ele recebeu uma proposta excelente. (The player may leave the club. He received an excellent proposal.) Each corpus token (words and punctuation) corresponds to a <word>.","The coreference was manually annotated and encoded as <markable> elements. Each anaphoric expression and antecedent were represented by markables. Anaphors’ markables had an extra attribute “pointer”, that refers to its antecedent markable. An example of a markable file is presented on Figure 5(a). Markables correspond to our finallevel of annotation. The “span” attribute refers to our primary data, the words. The other attributes (coref, classific) were specified according to our application. Figure 5(b) represents the abstract XML encoding for our markables file, according to VAML4",". Pointer, coreference and classification compose our dialect vocabulary for the following data categories: antecedent and types of discourse status, as in (Poesio 4","As we are not aware of a registry of data categories for coreference level, in our examples throughout the paper we of-ten use the same vocabulary in abstract and concrete encodings.","<words> <word id=\"word_1\">","<art canon=\"o\" gender=\"M\" number=\"S\"/> </word> <word id=\"word_2\">","<n canon=\"jogador\" gender=\"M\" number=\"S\"/> </word>","...","</words>","<struct type=\"MSAnnot\">","<struct id=\"w1\" type=\"W-level\"> <feat type=\"pos\">ART</feat> <feat type=\"lemma\">o</feat> <feat type=\"gender\">M</feat> <feat type=\"number\">S</feat> <feat type=\"target\">#w1</feat>","</struct>","<struct id=\"w2\" type=\"W-level\"> <feat type=\"pos\">N</feat> <feat type=\"lemma\">jogador</feat> <feat type=\"gender\">M</feat> <feat type=\"number\">S</feat> <feat type=\"target\">#w2</feat>","</struct>","...","</struct>","(a) (b) Figure 6: POS file. and Vieira, 1998) inpired on (Prince, 1981; Prince, 1992). According to our dialect instantiation style, the data categories are represented as attributes of <markable> elements.","To develop a tool for automatic coreference resolution, we needed to consider other intermediate levels of annotation: source of linguistic information used for solving anaphoras.","Our corpus was analysed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000). The original format of PALAVRAS output is not standard. As previously presented in Figure 3, on each line of the figure:"," the first symbol represents the syntactic function (‘SUBJ’= subject, ‘N’=noun modifier, ‘H’=head, etc.);"," following ‘:’ , we have the syntactic form for groups of words (’np’=noun phrase, etc.) and POS-tags for single words (’n’=noun, ’v’=verb, etc.);"," in brackets are the word canonical form and other inflectional tags;"," after the brackets comes the word as it occurs in the corpus.

We split PALAVRAS output into two annotation levels, one for POS and another for syntactic data. Figure 6(a) shows our scheme for POS file. The corresponding abstract XML fileis presented on Figure 6(b). Our data categories are word canonic form (lemma), pos, gender, number, person, tense, mode, and case. According to our dialect instantiation style, each POS data category is represented by a new XML element, the other infle xional tags are encoded as attributes of this element. By handling a parsed corpus we could treat compounds at word level; the multi word expression “São Paulo”, for example, is tokenised as one word and codified as <word id=\"word_9\">São_Paulo</word>.","We encode syntactic data as chunks. Each syntactic structure is represented by a <chunk> element. Figure 7(a) shows our encoding. The mapping to abstract XML is presented on Figure 7(b).

We be-lieve that a standard orientation may shed some light to those who are definingtheir projects. Concerning annotation level relations our annotation is based on object-based anchoring, especially because our primary data is represented by XML elements (words in our dialect, basic struct elements with id attributes in VAML).","Considering relations like parallelism, alternatives and aggregation (Ide and Romary, 2002) we see that our model includes aggregation at the chunk level. When studying annotation agreement we need to represent alternative data according to the judgment of each annotator (although we have adopted duplicated annotated filespreviously in our project).","Previous work on encoding standards has mentioned mainly POS and syntactic annotation. In this paper we extended its use for coreference annotation. Our data model could be adequately mapped to the standards.","An issue raised by coreference annotation is the need of two references for primary data in the same <struct>, one for anaphor (target) and another for its antecedent. In our examples, we encoded the reference to primary data indicating the antecedent by <feat> elements with attribute type=“pointer”.","An advantage we could expect to take from work related to standards is knowledge about the impact on performance in data handling according to encoding decisions.","Our project deals with different input and output formats.
