Like competitive linking, ProAlign uses a constrained search to find high scoring alignments. Like EM-based methods, a probability model is used to rank possible alignments. The goal of this paper is to give a bird’s eye view of the ProAlign system to encourage discussion and comparison."]},{"title":"1 Alignment Algorithm at a Glance","paragraphs":["We have submitted the ProAlign alignment system to the WPT’03 shared task. It received a 5.71% AER on the English-French task and 29.36% on the Romanian-English task. These results are with the no-null data; our output was not formatted to work with explicit nulls.","ProAlign works by iteratively improving an alignment. The algorithm creates an initial alignment using search, constraints, and summed φ2","correlation-based scores (Gale and Church, 1991). This is similar to the competitive linking process (Melamed, 2000). It then learns a probability model from the current alignment, and conducts a constrained search again, this time scoring alignments according to the probability model. The process continues until results on a validation set begin to indicate over-fitting.","For the purposes of our algorithm, we view an alignment as a set of links between the words in a sentence pair. Before describing the algorithm, we will define the following notation. Let E be an English sentence e1, e2, . . . , em and let F be a French sentence f1, f2, . . . , fn. We define a link l(ei, fj) to exist if ei and fj are a translation (or part of a translation) of one an-other. We define the null link l(ei, f0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation for any French word in F . The null link l(e0, fj) is defined similarly. An alignment A for two sentences E and F is a set of links such that every word in E and F participates in at least one link, and a word linked to e0 or f0 participates in no other links. If e occurs in E x times and f occurs in F y times, we say that e and f co-occur xy times in this sentence pair.","ProAlign conducts a best-first search (with constant beam and agenda size) to search a constrained space of possible alignments. A state in this space is a partial alignment, and a transition is defined as the addition of a single link to the current state. Any link which would create a state that does not violate any constraint is considered to be a valid transition. Our start state is the empty alignment, where all words in E and F are implicitly linked to null. A terminal state is a state in which no more links can be added without violating a constraint. Our goal is to find the terminal state with the highest probability.","To complete this algorithm, one requires a set of constraints and a method for determining which alignment is most likely. These are presented in the next two sections. The algorithm takes as input a set of English-French sentence pairs, along with dependency trees for the English sentences. The presence of the English dependency tree allows us to incorporate linguistic features into our model and linguistic intuitions into our constraints."]},{"title":"2 Constraints","paragraphs":["The model used for scoring alignments has no mechanism to prevent certain types of undesirable alignments, such as having all French words align to the same English word. To guide the search to correct alignments, we employ two constraints to limit our search for the most probable alignment. The first constraint is the one-to-one constraint (Melamed, 2000): every word (except the null words e0 and f0) participates in exactly one link.","The second constraint, known as the cohesion constraint (Fox, 2002), uses the dependency tree (Mel’čuk, 1987) of the English sentence to restrict possible link combinations. Given the dependency tree TE and a (partial) alignment A, the cohesion constraint requires that phrasal cohesion is maintained in the French sentence. If two phrases are disjoint in the English sentence, the alignment must not map them to overlapping intervals in the French sentence. This notion of phrasal constraints on alignments need not be restricted to phrases determined from a dependency structure. However, the experiments conducted in (Fox, 2002) indicate that dependency trees demonstrate a higher degree of phrasal cohesion during translation than other structures.","Consider the partial alignment in Figure 1. The most probable lexical match for the English word to is the French word à. When the system attempts to link to and à, the distinct English phrases [the reboot] and [the host to discover all the devices] will be mapped to intervals in the French sentence, creating the induced phrasal intervals [à . . . [réinitialisation] . . . périphériques]. Regardless of what these French phrases will be after the alignment is completed, we know now that their intervals will overlap. Therefore, this link will not be added to the partial alignment.

The phrase span of ei, spanP(ei, TE, A), is the image of the English phrase headed by ei in F given a (partial) alignment A. More precisely, spanP(ei, TE, A) = [k1, k2], where k1 = min{j|l(u, j) ∈ A, eu ∈ TE(ei)} k2 = max{j|l(u, j) ∈ A, eu ∈ TE(ei)}","The head span is the image of ei itself. We define spanH(ei, TE, A) = [k1, k2], where k1 = min{j|l(i, j) ∈ A} k2 = max{j|l(i, j) ∈ A}","In Figure 1, for the node reboot, the phrase span is [4,4] and the head span is also [4,4]; for the node discover (with the link between to and à in place), the phrase span is [2,11] and the head span is the empty set ∅.","With these definitions of phrase and head spans, we define two notions of overlap, originally introduced in (Fox, 2002) as crossings. Given a head node eh and its modifier em, a head-modifier overlap occurs when: spanH(eh, TE, A) ∩ spanP(em, TE, A) ̸= ∅ Given two nodes em1 and em2 which both modify the same head node, a modifier-modifier overlap occurs when: spanP(em1, TE, A) ∩ spanP(em2, TE, A) ̸= ∅","Following (Fox, 2002), we say an alignment is cohesive with respect to TE if it does not introduce any head-modifier or modifier-modifier overlaps. For example, the alignment A in Figure 1 is not cohesive because spanP (reboot, TE, A) = [4, 4] intersects spanP (discover, TE, A) = [2, 11]. Since both reboot and discover modify causes, this creates a modifier-modifier overlap. One can check for constraint violations inexpensively by incrementally updating the various spans as new links are added to the partial alignment, and checking for overlap after each modification. More details on the cohesion constraint can be found in (Lin and Cherry, 2003)."]},{"title":"3 Probability Model","paragraphs":["We define the word alignment problem as finding the alignment A that maximizes P (A|E, F ). ProAlign models P (A|E, F ) directly, using a different decomposition of terms than the model used by IBM (Brown et al., 1993). In the IBM models of translation, alignments exist as artifacts of a stochastic process, where the words in the English sentence generate the words in the French sentence. Our model does not assume that one sentence generates the other. Instead it takes both sentences as given, and uses the sentences to determine an alignment. An alignment A consists of t links {l1, l2, . . . , lt}, where each lk = l(eik , fjk ) for some ik and jk. We will refer to consecutive subsets of A as lj","i = {li, li+1, . . . , lj}. Given this notation, P (A|E, F ) can be decomposed as follows:","P (A|E, F ) = P (lt 1|E, F ) = t ∏ k=1","P (lk|E, F, lk−1 1 )","At this point, we factor P (lk|E, F, lk−1","1 ) to make computation feasible. Let Ck = {E, F, lk−1","1 } represent the context of lk. Note that both the context Ck and the link lk imply the occurrence of eik and fjk . We can rewrite P (lk|Ck) as: P (lk|Ck) = P (lk, Ck) P (Ck) = P (Ck|lk)P (lk) P (Ck, eik , fjk ) = P (lk|eik , fjk ) ×","P (Ck|lk) P (Ck|eik , fjk )","Here P (lk|eik , fjk ) is link probability given a cooccurrence of the two words, which is similar in spirit to Melamed’s explicit noise model (Melamed, 2000). This term depends only on the words involved directly in the link. The ratio P (Ck|lk)","P (Ck|ei","k ,fj","k ) modifies the link probability, providing context-sensitive information.","Ck remains too broad to deal with in practical systems. We will consider only a subset FT k of relevant features of Ck. We will make the Naı̈ve Bayes-style as-sumption that these features ft ∈ FT k are conditionally independent given either lk or (eik , fjk ). This produces a tractable formulation for P (A|E, F ): t ∏ k=1  P (lk|eik , fjk ) × ∏ ft∈FTk","P (ft|lk) P (ft|eik , fjk )   More details on the probability model used by ProAlign are available in (Cherry and Lin, 2003). 3.1 Features used in the shared task For the purposes of the shared task, we use two feature types. Each type could have any number of instantiations for any number of contexts. Note that each feature type is described in terms of the context surrounding a word pair.","The first feature type fta concerns surrounding links. It has been observed that words close to each other in the source language tend to remain close to each other in the translation (S. Vogel and Tillmann, 1996). To capture this notion, for any word pair (ei, fj), if a link l(ei′",", fj′",") exists within a window of two words (where i − 2 ≤ i′","≤ i + 2 and j − 2 ≤ j′","≤ j + 2), then we say that the feature fta(i − i′",", j − j′",", e","i′",") is active for this context. We refer to these as adjacency features.","The second feature type ftd uses the English parse tree to capture regularities among grammatical relations between languages. For example, when dealing with French and English, the location of the determiner with respect to its governor is never swapped during translation, while the location of adjectives is swapped frequently. For any word pair (ei, fj), let ei′","be the governor of ei, and let rel be the relationship between them. If a link l(ei′",", fj′",") exists, then we say that the feature ftd(j − j′",", rel ) is active for this context. We refer to these as dependency features.","Take for example Figure 2 which shows a partial alignment with all links completed except for those involving the. Given this sentence pair and English parse tree, we can extract features of both types to assist in the alignment of the1. The word pair (the1, l′",") will have an active adjacency feature fta(+1, +1, host) as well as a dependency feature ftd(−1, det). These two features will work together to increase the probability of this correct link. thehost discovers allthedevices","det subj pre det obj l' hôterepère touslespériphériques 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 thehost locate all the peripherals Figure 2: Feature Extraction Example In contrast, the incorrect link (the1, les) will have only ftd(+3, det), which will work to lower the link probability, since most determiners are located before their governors. 3.2 Training the model Since we always work from a current alignment, training the model is a simple matter of counting events in the current alignment. Link probability is the number of time two words are linked, divided by the number of times they co-occur. The various feature probabilities can be calculated by also counting the number of times a feature occurs in the context of a linked pair of words, and the number of times the feature is active for co-occurrences of the same word pair.","Considering only a single, potentially noisy alignment for a given sentence pair can result in reinforcing errors present in the current alignment during training. To avoid this problem, we sample from a space of probable alignments, as is done in IBM models 3 and above (Brown et al., 1993), and weight counts based on the likelihood of each alignment sampled under the current probability model. To further reduce the impact of rare, and potentially incorrect events, we also smooth our probabilities using m-estimate smoothing (Mitchell, 1997)."]},{"title":"4 Multiple Alignments","paragraphs":["The result of the constrained alignment search is a highprecision, word-to-word alignment. We then relax the word-to-word constraint, and use statistics regarding collocations with unaligned words in order to make many-to-one alignments. We also employ a further relaxed linking process to catch some cases where the cohesion constraint ruled out otherwise good alignments. These auxiliary methods are currently not integrated into our search or our probability model, although that is certainly a direction for future work."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have presented a brief overview of the major ideas behind our entry to the WPT’03 Shared Task.
