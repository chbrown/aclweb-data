In an experiment with an EBMT system, in which prior methods cannot work or work badly, the proposed split-and-translate method achieves much better results in translation quality."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["To achieve translation technology that is adequate for speech translation, the possibilities of several corpus-based approaches are being investigated. Among these methods, DP-match Driven transDucer (D3",") has been proposed as an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT). When D3","is adapted to Japanese-to-English translation in a travel conversation domain, the method can achieve a high translation quality (Sumita, 2001 and 2002). On the other hand, the translation method is sensitive to the long sentence problem, where longer input sentences make it more difficult for a machine translation (MT) system to perform good translation. To overcome this problem, the technique of splitting an input sentence 1","and translating the split sentences appears promising.","The methods of previous studies related to this approach can be roughly classified into two types: one splits sentences before translation and the other splits them in the parsing phase of translation. We’ll call the former pre-process-splitting, the latter parse-time-  1 Strictly speaking, this isn't necessarily a sentence but an utterance including sentences. In this paper, we use the term sentence without strictly defining it to simplify discussion. splitting, and translation with any splitting split-and-translate.","In previous research on pre-process-splitting, such as Takezawa (1999), many methods have been based on word-sequence characteristics. Some research efforts have achieved high performance in recall and precision against correct splitting positions. Despite such a high performance, from the view point of translation, MT systems are not always able to translate the split sentences well.","In some research works on parse-time-splitting, such as Furuse (1998 and 2001), sentences have been split based on parsing trees under construction. Partly constructed trees are combined and translated. A sentences is split according to the sub-trees. The split sentences can be translated because an internal parsing mechanism guarantees their fitness. However, parsetime-splitting technique cannot be adapted, or can be adapted only as pre-process-splitting by using an external parsing system, to MT systems that deal with no parsing tree, such as D3","and Statistical MT.","In this paper, we propose another split-and-translate technique in which splitting and translation act in harmony. This technique depends on no particular MT method, therefore can be applied to D3",". In order to prove the effect for translation quality, our proposed split-and-translate method and, for the purpose of comparison, a pre-process-splitting technique are evaluated. For convenience, we'll call the two split-and-translate methods in our experiments as follows.  method-T: Our proposed method based on partial Trans-","lation results, described in section 2. method-N: Before translation, splitting an input sen-","tence with the pre-process-splitting method based","on N-gram, described in section 3.  The following sections describe the two methods, the MT system, D3","that the methods are applied to, and experiments."]},{"title":"2 Proposed Split-and-Translate: Method-T","paragraphs":["An MT system sometimes fails to translate an input, for example, due to failure in parsing a sentence or retriev-ing examples. Such a failure occurs particularly when an input is longer. In such a case, by splitting the input, translation may be successfully performed for each portion. Therefore, one idea is to arrange the translations of split portions in the same order as in the source sentence and to consider the arrangement as a translation of the entire input sentence. Particularly in a dialogue, sentences tend not to have complicated nested structures, and many long sentences can be split into mutually in-dependent portions. Therefore, if splitting positions and translations of split portions are adequate, the possibility that this simple arrangement of the translations can provide an adequate translation of the complete input is relatively high.","In the example below, a Japanese sentence (1-j) has potentially adequate splitting positions such as (1-j'). The arrangement of the English translations of the portions (1-e) is an adequate translation.  (1-j) sou desu ka ee kekkou desu jaa tsuin de o negai shi","masu2"," (1-j’) sou desu ka | ee | kekkou desu | jaa | tsuin de o","negai shi masu (1-e) i see | yes | that's fine | then | a twin please"]},{"title":"2.1 Criteria","paragraphs":["When you split-and-translate a sentence, some portions can be translated while others cannot. We call the count of words in the portions that cannot be translated the fault-length. It is natural to consider (X) as a criterion to judge the goodness of split-and-translate results.  (X) The smaller the fault-length is, the better the result","is.  Let the term partial-translation be the translation of a portion that can be translated. In a split-and-translate result, there can be some partial-translations. Partial-translation-count expresses the number of partial-translations. (Y) is also a natural criterion to judge the goodness of a split-and-translate result.  (Y) The smaller the partial-translation-count is, the","better the result is.  Many current MT methods produce not only target sentences but also scores. The meaning of a score, depend-  2 Its English translation is “I see. Then, fine, we’ll take a twin.” in a corpus ing on the translation method, can be parsing cost, distance between sentences, word correspondence probability, or other meanings or combinations of the above. If there is a correlation between the score and the translation quality, we can make use of this score as a confidence factor of translation. We can use the confidence factor as another criterion for split-and-translate results. In order to ensure reliability for the complete result of split-and-translate procedures from confidence factors, the scores of all partial-translations are combined. We call this combined score the combined-reliability. How to combine scores depends on the mathematical characteristics of the scores. Therefore the third criterion (Z) is added.  (Z) The higher the combined-reliability is, the better the","result is.  From the above considerations, the proposed method utilizes these criteria to judge the goodness of split-and-translate results with the priority as follows.  1. The smaller the fault-length is, the better the result","is. 2. Unless judged with criterion-1, the smaller the","partial-translation-count is, the better the result is. 3. Unless judged with criterion-1 or criterion-2, the","higher the combined-reliability is, the better the","result is.  The case where translation can be performed without splitting meets these criteria. In this case, the fault-length is 0, the partial-translation-count is 1, and the combined-reliability equals the score of the complete translation that must be utilized by the MT system; therefore, this result is the best.","Criterion-3 has a low priority. Unless an MT system has a confidence factor, only criteria-1-2 are used.","These three criteria are based on the output of an MT system, that is, how well the MT system can translate portions. Split portions are translated, and the partial-translation results are evaluated to select the best split positions (the algorithm is discussed in section 6). As the proposed split-and-translate method is based on these criteria only, this method assumes no parsing process and depends on neither a particular language nor a particular MT method."]},{"title":"2.2 Example","paragraphs":["Below, we show an example of selecting a result from candidates based on criteria-1-2.

Part-of-speech and conjugation-type are considered as word characteristics. When the plausibility is higher than a given threshold, the position is regarded as a splitting position.
