Interestingly, this class of expressions, usually termed in linguistic literature as “complex prepositions” (CPs), “phrasal prepositions”, “quasi-preposition s” or “preposition-lik e word formations” occurs in many different languages, thereby showing nearly uniform properties (cf. examples below quoted from (Lindqvist, 1994), (Quirk and Mulholland, 1964), (Grochowski et al., 1984) and (Beneš, 1974)).

As well as in the case of other multiword expressions (MWEs), the question arises of how they should be analyzed to make them suitable for machine processing.1","In this paper, we will propose an HPSG-based linguistically motivated, formal treatment of CPs, applicable for computational platforms intended for developing typed feature structure grammars.","The starting point of our investigations is the summary of empirical facts about CPs. Although, we have indicated above that CPs can be considered a cross-linguistic phenomenon, we will focus in this paper exclusively on German data, because they provide very explicit and convincing linguistic evidence which motivates and supports our approach. However, we assert that the analysis proposed here for","1","For discussion on various strategies for analyzing MWEs such as listing “words with spaces”, hierarchically organized lexicons, restricted combinatoric rules, lexical selection, “idiomatic constructions” and simple statistical affinity using HPSG grammar framework see (Sag et al., 2002).

(2)).","(2) In in Bezug regard auf to Privatsphäre private_sphere gibt is es there im in_the WWW WWW immer still noch yet keine no einheitlichen uniform","Richtlinien.","rules","‘With regard to privacy, there are still no uniform rules","in the WWW.’","However, the interdependence between the particular elements of those expressions seems to defy standard constraints on the PP structure of German. To see this, we will consider a typical PP in (3).","(3) in einer engen Verbindung mit den Beratern in a close connection with the advisers ‘in close connection with the advisers’","The standard analysis for such PPs assumes that the preposition in (‘in’) acts as the head of the entire phrase, taking the NP as its complement. The selected NP is headed by the noun Verbindung (‘connection’) and contains the adjective engen (‘close’) and the determiner einer (‘a’). Furthermore, we have the PP mit den Beratern (‘with the advisers’), which is selected by the noun Verbindung as its complement and can be omitted without causing ungrammaticality (cf. Figure 1 on the next page).","2","For German, Schröder (1986) specifiesmore than 90 “complex prepositions”, while e.g. Beneš (1974) itemizes 160 examples, though he emphasizes the incompleteness of his list. In any case, CPs do not form a marginal class of expressions in contemporary German. For further discussion on CPs in German see (Beneš, 1974), (Buscha, 1984), (Lindqvist, 1994), (Meibauer, 1995).","Trying to apply the above approach to an analysis of PPs involving a CP presents several problems. To see these problems, we will consider one of the CPs combined with an NP, which looks very similar to the PP in (3) (cf. (4)).","(4) in in Verbindung connection mit with diesem this Problem problem ‘in connection with this problem’","Using PPs such as those in (4) in contexts exemplified in (5), we can observe many contrasts with the traditional PPs such as those in (3).","(5) In in Verbindung connection mit with diesem this","Problem","problem möchte ich darauf hinweisen, dass ... would_like I DA_on point_out that ‘In connection with this problem, I would like to point out that ...’","First of all, the noun Verbindung cannot syntactically select for a determiner or a quantifier, nor it can be combined with possessive pronouns or prenominal genitives (cf. (6a)).3","Secondly, it cannot be modified (cf. (6b) and (6c)). Finally, the PP mit den Beratern (’with the advisers’) cannot be deleted (cf. (6d)).","(6) a. in in *einer/ a/ *der/ the/ *seiner/ his/ *Peters Peter’s Verbindung connection mit with diesem this Problem problem ...","b. in in *enger/ close/ *unerwarteter unexpected Verbindung connection mit with diesem this Problem problem ...","c. in in [Verbindung connection mit with diesem this Problem], problem *die which uns us betrifft concerns ... 3","However, the definitenessinformation can be provided directly by P","s, since P","N","P","NP sequences as well as other PPs allow for expressions referred to as preposition-determiner contraction (e.g. in dem","im). Such expressions can be considered as a special kind prepositions, that additionally state for the definiteness specification.

This complex preposition then selects an NP forming a prepositional phrase.","The main problem with this analysis consists in the assumption that the preposition mit (‘with’) belongs to the complex preposition and cannot form a constituent with the NP diesem Problem. However, there are several data demonstrating the opposite.","Firstly, the combinations P","NP where P","is realized by von (’of’) can be replaced by the genitive; this replacement of von adheres to the restrictions on the distribution of postnominal genitives and von-PPs in German (cf. (7a)). Secondly, the discussed sequences can be substituted by wo/da expressions as in (7b), which are usually considered as proforms for PPs. Finally, the P","NP sequences can be coordinated with PPs headed by the same preposition (cf. (7c)).

Thus, another analysis seems to arise, that assume P","N","combinations to constitute complex lexical categories, requiring prepositional complements (cf. Figure 3).","However, the following fact argues against the analysis in Figure 3: There is a type of nouns in German that allows for two options in realizing the dative case. While the firsteventuality relates to suffixless forms, the second one relates to forms ending in -e. The choice of a given form is usually determined by stylistic effects. Examples in (8) show that dative nouns of the discussed declension class can occur within P","N","sequences in both forms.

Thus, the data above clearly eliminate the analysis in Figure 3. We will consider one more possible analysis, assuming prepositions heading P","N","P","NPs as select-ing for two arguments: a noun and a PP, which would result in structures such as those in Figure 4. However, this assumption seems unmaintainable for the following reason: It cannot enforce that whenever a noun","appears, a PP headed by a preposition","is required. In consequence, ungrammatical PPs such as those in (9) cannot be ruled out.","(9) a. * in in Verbindung connection zu to diesem this Problem problem","b. * in in Bezug regard mit with diesem this Problem problem Rather, the assumption seems plausible that syntactic properties of P","NP sequences are determined by N","s since these properties are identical with the properties of PPs selected by the corresponding nouns in their free occurrences.","Further evidence seems to argue against the above analysis. Namely, if prepositions heading P","N","P","NPs take both N","s and P","NPs as their arguments assigning theta roles to them, then it is in-explicable why the semantic relationship between these two arguments differs from the semantic relationship between the referential arguments of all other transitive predicates. As we can see in (10), no coindexing is possible between the noun Verbindung and the personal pronoun ihr (‘her’) or the anaphora sich selbst (‘herself’). Rather, ihr and sich selbst belong to the argument structure of the noun Verbindung, and are possibly bound by a PRO-like element which belongs to the same argument structure and which is controlled by the noun Sarah.","(10) Sarah Sarah wollte wanted was sth. sagen say in in Verbindung connection mit with","ihr","/","her","/ [sich [her","selbst]",".","self]","‘Sarah","wanted to say something in connection","with","her","/ herself .’","All these observations seem to lead to the following conclusions. Firstly, the PP mit diesem Problem acts as an argument of the noun Verbindung in that it is determined by this noun with regard to its syntactic properties, e.g. the form of the heading preposition. Secondly, the PP mit diesem Problem is theta-marked by the noun Verbindung. Finally, the PP mit diesem Problem is expected to be syntactically selected by the noun Verbindung as its complement. Thus, we proceed according to the standard methods of handling relational nouns taking prepositional arguments. This explains why N","P","NP sequences within the discussed PPs share many grammatical properties with the appropriate phrases occurring within other syntactic contexts.","On the other hand, data in (7) indicate for P","N","P","NP expressions constituency such as those in Figure 4.","On the basis of these observations, the assumption can be made that P","NP sequences are lexically selected by N","s, yet are realized syntactically by P","s."]},{"title":"3 The Analysis","paragraphs":["Formalizing this idea within the HPSG paradigm, we will make use mainly of two features: the ARG-ST feature and the VAL feature, whose value contains three valence lists: the SPR list, the SUBJ list and the COMPS list. Specifying the relationship between the values of these features, one can make generalizations about selectional properties of lexical signs. Thereby, the relationship between the ARG-ST and the SPR, SUBJ and the COMPS values (which are all assumed to have a form of list) does not always have to be an append relationship. Also, other relationships can be assumed, thereby facilitating the expression of possible discrepancies between the structure of the syntactic environment that a given lexical sign can construct, and this lexical sign’s current selectional requirements.","Such discrepancies appear for instance in the case of argument raising as realized within the HPSG grammar framework. To illustrate this idea, we will look at the essential aspect of the German verbal complex analysis in the style of (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1989). According to this analysis, the lexical entries of German auxiliaries are specifiedto subcategorize for verbal complements and to raise the arguments of their complements. (See the simplifiedlexical entry for the auxiliary wollen (‘want’) in Figure 5 on the next page.)","Thus, the auxiliary will (‘wants’) in the structure in Figure 6 selects for the verb lesen (‘read’) first, and then it selects the arguments of lesen (‘read’), the NP das Buch (‘the book’) and the NP Peter (‘Peter’), as its own complements. VP NP Peter (‘Peter’) V”","NP das Buch (‘the book’) V’ V lesen (‘read’) V will (‘wants’) Figure 6: The structure of the VP Peter das Buch lesen will (‘Peter wants to read the book’) This idea underlies most current HPSG approaches to verbal complexes in Germanic and Romance languages. We argue that the same method can also be used to make generalizations about selectional properties of prepositions, and, thereby, to license “complex prepositions”.","Thus, based on empirical data, we assume two uses of prepositions: the raising and the non-raising usages. The preposition in in (11a) occurs in a non-raising context, while the preposition in in (11b) occurs in a raising context.","(11) a. in einer engen Verbindung mit den Beratern in a close connection with the advisors ‘in a close connection with the advisors’","b. in in Verbindung connection mit with diesem this Problem problem ‘in connection with this problem’","Our assumption is that both strings mit den Beratern in (11a) and mit diesem Problem in (11b) act as arguments of the noun Verbindung, and are thus determined by this noun with regard to their syntactic properties.","Furthermore, we assume that the preposition in in (11b) in opposition to in in (11a), which subcategorizes the saturated NP, selects first the noun Verbindung (which does not realize its complement) and then in selects the complement of Verbindung, the PP mit diesem Problem. That is, by virtue of an appropriate lexical principle of grammar specifying the valence of prepositions, the complement of the noun Verbindung is raised by in to become the complement of in, and be realized by in syntactically."]},{"title":"4 HPSG Formalization","paragraphs":["Avoiding redundancies in the lexicon, we specify only one lexical entry for in, thereby underspecify-ing information about its argument.

Here, the list of complements syntactically selected by a preposition is a concatenation of its own ARG-ST list and the list of complements of its argument.4","It has to be mentioned that the raising of more than one nominal complement result in ungrammatical constructions like those in (12).","(12) a. *in in [Verbindung] connection [der the Regierung] government"," [mit with diesem this Problem] problem ...

Due to the ARG-ST Mapping Lexical Principle for Prepositions in Figure 9, the preposition in, which takes one nominal argument with one unrealized complement can be licensed. Thus, the syntactic and semantic properties of that complement are determined not by the preposition, but by the noun. Thereby, ungrammatical PPs such as those in (9) can be blocked. Both the noun and its unrealized complement are mapped to the COMPS list of in and, according to the constraints on the head-complement-structures for prepositions, they are syntactically selected by in.","The first complement that in selects is the noun. By virtue of selectional requirements of restrictive adjectives as well as prepositions modifying nouns, that are specified as combining with complement-saturated nouns only, the modifying of complement-unsaturated nouns is blocked.

We have thereby seen that the previous approaches to this phenomenon are highly problematic. We then proposed an HPSG analysis based on the raising mechanism assuming prepositions to be able to raise complements of their arguments. Underspecifying valence information within lexical entries of prepositions and applying appropriate lexical constraints, the presented theory offers a non-redundant description of linguistic facts about both the raising and non-raising prepositions.","The proposed analysis entails a technique which is already well established in the HPSG-based studies. We have shown for instance that there are parallels between the raising analysis proposed here for CPs and the raising analysis of German verbal complexes as proposed in (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1989).5","In processing systems, an implementation of the idea of raising as presented and formalized in Section Four has already proved to be computationally tractable.
