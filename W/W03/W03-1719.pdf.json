We give the motivation for having an international segmentation contest (given that there have been two within-China contests to date) and we report on the results of this firstinternational contest, analyze these results, and make some recommendations for the future."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Chinese word segmentation is a difficult problem that has received a lot of attention in the literature; reviews of some of the various approaches can be found in (Wang et al., 1990; Wu and Tseng, 1993; Sproat and Shih, 2001). The problem with this literature has always been that it is very hard to compare systems, due to the lack of any common standard test set. Thus, an approach that seems very promising based on its published report is nonetheless hard to compare fairly with other systems, since the systems are often tested on their own selected test corpora. Part of the problem is also that there is no single accepted segmentation standard: There are several, including the four standards used in this evaluation.","A number of segmentation contests have been held in recent years within Mainland China, in the context of more general evaluations for Chinese-English machine translation. See (Yao, 2001; Yao, 2002) for the firstand second of these; the third evaluation will be held in August 2003. The test corpora were segmented according to the Chinese national standard GB 13715 (GB/T 13715–92, 1993), though some lenience was granted in the case of plausible alternative segmentations (Yao, 2001); so while GB 13715 specifies the segmentation  / for Mao Zedong, ","","was also allowed. Accuracies in the mid 80’s to mid 90’s were reported for the four systems that participated in the firstevaluation, with higher scores (many in the high nineties) being reported for the second evaluation.","The motivations for holding the current contest are twofold. First of all, by making the contest international, we are encouraging participation from people and institutions who work on Chinese word segmentation anywhere in the world. The finalset of participants in the bakeoff include two from Mainland China, three from Hong Kong, one from Japan, one from Singapore, one from Taiwan and four from the United States.","Secondly, as we have already noted, there are at least four distinct standards in active use in the sense that large corpora are being developed according to those standards; see Section 2.1. It has also been observed that different segmentation standards are appropriate for different purposes; that the segmentation standard that one might prefer for information retrieval applications is likely to be different from the one that one would prefer for text-to-speech synthesis; see (Wu, 2003) for useful discussion. Thus, while we do not subscribe to the view that any of the extant standards are, in fact, appropriate for any particular application, nevertheless, it seems desirable to have a contest where people are tested against more than one standard.","A third point is that we decided early on that we would not be lenient in our scoring, so that alternative segmentations as in the case of ","","","Mao Zedong, cited above, would not be allowed. While it would be fairly straightforward (in many cases) to automatically score both alternatives, we felt we could provide a more objective measure if we went strictly by the particular segmentation standard being tested on, and simply did not get into the business of deciding upon allowable alternatives.","Comparing segmenters is difficult. This is not only because of differences in segmentation standards but also due to differences in the design of systems: Systems based exclusively (or even primarily) on lexical and grammatical analysis will often be at a disadvantage during the comparison compared to systems trained exclusively on the training data. Competitions also may fail to predict the performance of the segmenter on new texts outside the training and testing sets. The handling of out-of-vocabulary words becomes a much larger issue in these situations than is accounted for within the test environment: A system that performs admirably in the competition may perform poorly on texts from different registers.","Another issue that is not accounted for in the current collection of evaluations is the handling of short strings with minimal context, such as queries submitted to a search engine. This has been studied indirectly through the cross-language information retrieval work performed for the TREC 5 and TREC 6 competitions (Smeaton and Wilkinson, 1997; Wilkinson, 1998).","This report summarizes the results of this First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, provides some analysis of the results, and makes specific recommendations for future bakeoffs. One thing we do not do here is get into the details of specific systems; each of the participants was required to provide a four page description of their system along with detailed discussion of their results, and these papers are published in this volume."]},{"title":"2 Details of the contest 2.1 Corpora","paragraphs":["The corpora are detailed in Table 1. Links to descriptions of the corpora can be found at http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2003/ bakeoff_instr.html; publications on specific corpora are (Huang et al., 1997) (Academia Sinica), (Xia, 1999) (Chinese Treebank); the Beijing University standard is very similar to that outlined in (GB/T 13715–92, 1993). Table 1 lists the abbreviations for the four corpora that will be used throughout this paper. The suffixes “o” and “c” will be used to denote open and closed tracks, respectively: Thus “ASo,c” denotes the Academia Sinica corpus, both open and closed tracks; and “PKc” denotes the Beijing University corpus, closed track.","During the course of this bakeoff, a number of inconsistencies in segmentation were noted in the CTB corpus by one of the participants. This was done early enough so that it was possible for the CTB developers to correct some of the more common cases, both in the training and the test data. The revised training data was posted for participants, and the revised test data was used during the testing phase.","Inconsistencies were also noted by another participant for the AS corpus. Unfortunately this came too late in the process to correct the data. However, some informal tests on the revised testing data indicated that the differences were minor. 2.2 Rules and Procedures The contest followed a strict set of guidelines and a rigid timetable. The detailed instructions for the bakeoff can be found at http://www.sighan. org/bakeoff2003/bakeoff_instr.html (with simplified and traditional Chinese versions also available). Training material was available starting March 15, testing material was available April 22, and the results had to be returned to the SIGHAN ftp site by April 25 no later than 17:00 EDT.","Upon initial registration sites were required to declare which corpora they would be training and testing on, and whether they would be participating in the open or closed tracks (or both) on each corpus, Corpus Abbrev.

However, if a site selected the open track the site was required to explain what percentage of the results came from which sources. For example, if the system did particularly well on out-of-vocabulary words then the participants were required to explain if, for example, those results could mostly be attributed to having a good dictionary."," In the closed test, participants could only use training material from the training data for the particular corpus being testing on. No other material was allowed.","Other obvious restrictions applied: Participants were prohibited from testing on corpora from their own sites, and by signing up for a particular track, participants were declaring implicitly that they had not previously seen the test corpus for that track.","Scoring was completely automatic. Note that the scoring software does not correct for cases where a participant converted from one coding scheme into another, and any such cases were counted as errors. Results were returned to participants within a couple of days of submission of the segmented test data. The script used for scoring can be downloaded from http://www.sighan.org/ bakeoff2003/score; it is a simple Perl script that depends upon a version of diff (e.g. GNU diffutils 2.7.2), that supports the -y flag for side-by-side output format. 2.3 Participating sites Participating sites are shown in Table 2. These are a subset of the sites who had registered for the bakeoff, as some sites withdrew due to technical difficulties."]},{"title":"3 Further details of the corpora","paragraphs":["An unfortunate, and sometimes unforseen, complexity in dealing with Chinese text on the computer is the plethora of character sets and character encodings used throughout Greater China. This is demonstrated in the Encoding column of Table 1:","1. Both AS and HK utilize complex-form (or “traditional”) characters, using variants of the Big Five character set. The Academia Sinica corpus is composed almost entirely of characters in pure Big Five (four characters, 0xFB5B, 0xFA76, 0xFB7A, and 0xFAAF are outside the encoding range of Big Five), while the City University corpus utilizes 38 (34 unique) characters from the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS) extension to Big Five.","2. The CTB and PK corpora each use simple-form (or “simplified”) characters, using the EUC-CN encoding of the GB 2312-80 character set. However, The PKU corpus includes characters that are not part of GB 2312-80, but are encoded in GBK. GBK is an extension of GB 2312-80 that incorporates some 18,000 hanzi found in Unicode 2.1 within the GB-2312 code space. Only Microsoft’s CP936 implements GBK.","This variation of encoding is exacerbated by the usual lack of specificdeclaration in the files.

We include as “B ASE”, and “T OP” the baseline and topline scores discussed previously. In most cases people performed above the baseline, though well below the ideal topline; note though that the two participants in the Academia Sinica open track underperformed the baseline.","Performance on the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) corpus was generally lower than all the other corpora; omitting S02, which only ran on CTBo,c the scores for the other systems were uniformly higher on other corpora than they were on CTB, the single exception being S11 which did better on CTBo than on HKo. The baseline for CTB is also much lower than the baseline for other corpora, so one might be inclined to ascribe the generally lower performance to the smaller training data for this corpus. Also, the OOV rate for this corpus is much higher than all of the other corpora, and since error rates are generally higher on OOV, this is surely a contributing factor. However, this would only explain why CTB showed lower performance on the closed test; on the open test, one might expect the size of the training data to matter less, but there were still large differences between several systems’ performance on CTB and their performance on other corpora. Note also that the topline for CTB is also lower than for the other corpora. What all of this suggests is that the CTB may simply be less consistent than the other corpora in its segmentation; indeed one of the participants (Andi Wu) noted a number of inconsistencies in both the training and the test data (though inconsistencies were also noted","Site word count R c","P c","F OOV R","R","","S09 11,985 0.966 0.0033 0.956","0.0037 0.961 0.022 0.364 0.980","S12 11,985 0.961 0.0035 0.958","0.0037 0.959 0.022 0.729 0.966","S06 11,985 0.944 0.0042 0.945","0.0042 0.945 0.022 0.574 0.952","S05 11,985 0.952 0.0039 0.931","0.0046 0.942 0.022 0.043 0.972","S01 11,985 0.953 0.0039 0.924","0.0048 0.938 0.022 0.178 0.970 Table 5: Scores for AS closed, sorted by F.","Site word count R c","P c","F OOV R","R","","S01 39,922 0.886 0.0032 0.875","0.0033 0.881 0.181 0.705 0.927","S02 39,922 0.892 0.0031 0.856","0.0035 0.874 0.181 0.644 0.947","S10 39,922 0.867 0.0034 0.797","0.0040 0.831 0.181 0.431 0.963","S06 39,922 0.852 0.0036 0.807","0.0040 0.829 0.181 0.412 0.949","S05 39,922 0.800 0.0040 0.674","0.0047 0.732 0.181 0.076 0.959 Table 6: Scores for CTB closed, sorted by F. for the AS corpus).4","Systems that ran on both closed and open tracks for the same corpus generally did better on the open track, indicating (not surprisingly) that using additional data can help.

Similarly","((corporate) vice president) is segmented as one word in training data but as two words (","/",") in the testing data. As a finalexample, superlatives such as","(best) should be segmented as a single word if the adjective is monosyllabic, and it is not being used predicatively; however this principle is not consistently applied.","Wu also notes that the test data is different from the training data in several respects. Most of the training data comprise texts about Mainland China, whereas most of the testing data is about Taiwan. The test data contains classes of items, such as URL’s and English page designations (“p. 64”), that never appeared in the test data. sure, the performance of the baseline is only above 0.0 fortuitously, as we noted in Section 4.1. Similarly the topline performance is only less than 1.0 in cases where there are two or more possible decompositions of a string, and where the option with the longest prefixis not the correct one.","It is with OOV recall that we see the widest variation among systems, which in turn is consistent with the observation that dealing with unknown words is the major outstanding problem of Chinese word segmentation. While some systems performed little better than the baseline, others had a very respectable 0.80 recall on OOV. Again, there was clearly a benefit for many systems in using additional resources than what is in the training data: A number of systems that were run on both closed and open tracks showed significantimprovements in the open track. For the closed-track entries that did well on OOV, one must conclude that they have effective unknown-word detection methods."]},{"title":"6 Summary and recommendations","paragraphs":["We feel that this First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff has been useful in that it has provided us with a good sense of the range of performance of various systems, both from academic and industrial institutions.

While we are familiar with the approaches taken in several of the tested systems, we leave it up to the individual participants to describe their approaches and hopefully elucidate which aspects of their approaches are most responsible for their successes and failures; the participants’ papers all appear in this volume. We leave it up to the research community as a whole to decide whether one approach or another shows most promise.","We believe that there should be future competitions of this kind, possibly not every year, but certainly every couple of years and we have some specific recommendations on how things might be improved in such future competitions:","1. It may be a good idea to insist that all participants participate in all tracks, subject of course to the restriction that participants may not be evaluated on data from their own institution. The decision this time to let people pick and choose was motivated in part by the concern that if we insisted that people participate in all tracks, some participants might be less inclined to participate. It was also motivated in part by the different Chinese coding schemes used by the various corpora, and the possibility that someone’s system might work on one coding scheme, but not the other. However with sufficientplanning, perhaps giv-ing people a longer period of time for training their systems than was possible with this contest, it should be possible to impose this restriction without scaring away potential participants.","2. We would like to see more testing data developed for the next bakeoff. While the test sets turned out to be large enough to measure significant differences between systems in most cases, a larger test set would allow even better statistics.

It would be interesting to know if this is true in the domain of Chinese word segmentation, which should be possible to findout if we get a good balance of both.","For the present, we will make the training and test data for the bakeoff available via http://www. sighan.org/bakeoff2003 (subject to the restrictions of the content providers), so that others can better study the results of this contest."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["First and foremost we wish to thank the follow-ing institutions for providing the training and testing data for this bakeoff:"," Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica."," Institute of Computational Linguistics, Beijing University."," Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong."," The Chinese Treebank Project, University of Pennsylvania, and the Linguistic Data Consortium.
