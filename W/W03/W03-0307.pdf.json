The task was to indicate which word token in an English alignment sample corresponds to which word token in the French alignment sample. Two types of submission were permitted: for restricted submissions were allowed a “sentence” aligned segment of the Canadian Hansards to train the systems while unrestricted submission would be allowed to use additional resources. The performance of the systems was compared for a set of 447 English—French hand-aligned test samples which were also taken from the Canadian Hansards. Five institutes participated in the English—French alignment task, submitting a total of 16 sets of alignment data. To evaluate the submitted data, we extracted bilingual phrase dictionaries from the word-alignment data. The extracted dictionaries of the submitted data were compared with the extracted dictionary of the test data. We first discuss word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignment format. We present two different methods for extracting bilingual dictionaries from the word alignment data: a minimal dictionary contains the least number of unambiguous phrase-to-phrase translations while an exhaustive dictionary contains all possible unambiguous translations. We examine the test data (i.e. the “golden standard”) and the submitted alignment data. We discuss their peculiarities and give examples of phrases easy and difficult to align.

In figure 1, “null-alignment” plots the union of the submitted alignment data and the inserted null-alignments. Null-alignments were not added to submission 16 as it provides alignment information for every word. The last data point on the x-axis (i.e. 17) represents the test data. As outlined in Melamed (1998), a sequence of words which translates in a non-compositional fashion into a target sequence is exhaustively linked (see example 2)."]},{"title":"Phrase-to-phrase alignment","paragraphs":["Phrase-to-phrase alignment is represented by intervals indicating the starting and ending words of the phrases. In phrase-to-phrase alignment: (i) a sequence of English word tokens (i.e. a","phrase) are mutually linked with sequences of","French word tokens (i.e. a French phrase)2","."," 2 We do not use the term “phrase” here in its linguistic sense: a phrase in this paper can be any sequence of words, even if they are not a linguistic constituent. (ii) an English phrase may only be unambiguously","linked to exactly one French phrase and vice","versa. Phrase-to-phrase alignments can be nested. For instance, the shorter English—French phrase translation 9-9 <- > 11-11 is included in the longer phrase translation 5-11 <-> 9-12: 5-11 9-12: for a detailed explanation","as to what <-> fournir de telles explications 9-9 11-11: as <-> telles In this way structural information can be stored. On the other hand, we do not allow ambiguous phrase alignments as e.g.: 8-8 12-12 explanation <-> explications 11-11 12-12 what <-> explications When extracting phrase-to-phrase translations from the word-to-word alignment data we include a sufficient context which disambiguates the phrases. Given the word alignment data in example 1, the minimum context required to disambiguate the French word “explications” is the phrase 5-11 <-> 9-12. From the word alignment data we generate bilingual dictionaries in two different ways: a minimal dictionary contains only the shortest unambiguous phrase-to-phrase translations. For instance, from the alignment data in example 1, the following 8 entries are generated as a minimal dictionary:3","","En Fr","1-1 1-1","2-13 2-12","3-3 2-2","4-4 3-3","5-11 9-12","9-9 11-11","14-14 14-14","15-15 16-16"," 3 As shorthand notation we use here the offset numbers. In the generated dictionary, we have extracted the sequences of words instead of the offset numbers. In an exhaustive dictionary all possible unambiguous phrase translations are extracted. An exhaustive dictionary is a superset of the minimal dictionary. For example 1, seven additional entries are generated:","En Fr","1-13 1-12","1-14 1-14","1-15 1-16","2-14 2-14","2-15 2-16","3-4 2-3","14-15 14-16 Note that these additional phrase translations can be compositionally generated with the minimal dictionary. To evaluate the word alignment data through phrasal alignments, we generated three types of dictionaries for all 16 submissions and the test data: (i) an alignment-based minimal dictionary,","align-dic1; actually 447 small dictionar-","ies for each sample alignment. (ii) a text-based minimal dictionary (text-","dic1)which is the union of the align-dic1. (iii) an exhaustive text-based dictionary (text-","dic2) which is the union of exhaustive","alignment dictionaries. As can be seen from figure 1, the size of the exhaustive dictionary (text-dic2) is in most cases much bigger than those of the minimal dictionaries align-dic1 and text-dic1. The reason is due to the way the data has been aligned."]},{"title":"3 4 The word alignment data","paragraphs":["In this section we show that the test alignment data is structurally different from the submitted data. The hand aligned test data reflects the phrasal nature of the alignments, while the submissions are to a greater extent compositional. The test data (see set 17 in figure 1) has about twice to three times as many word-alignment points than the submissions. While this often leads to high precision and lower recall for word alignment, the reverse is true for the extracted phrasal dictionaries (also figure 3). The test alignment data of sample 91 contains 68 word-to-word alignment points shown in example 2; about four times the average number of word alignment points for this sample. Comparing example 2 with the submitted data of submission 16 (example 3) brings to light the phrasal nature of the test set. Extracting a minimal phrase dictionary from test set word alignment data in example 2 produces the following three entries","1-14 1-15","5-8 7-12","15-15 16-16 The following additional entry is generated in the exhaustive dictionary:1-15 <-> 1-16"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Note that more word alignments could have been possible here, for instance:","i <-> je","asking <-> demandé","explanation <-> explications","not <-> ne , pas Despite the existence of some fine-grained word-to-word correspondences in the test data, human aligners tend to mark phrasal translations. In contrast to the phrasal nature of the test alignments, most submissions show a more compositional alignment structure. For instance, alignment data of sample 91 for submission 16 has 18 word-to-word alignment points (example 3). When the alignments are more compositional, more coherent phrasal translations can be extracted. Thus, the minimal phrase dictionary extracted from example 3 contains 13 entries, while the exhaustive dictionary contains 54 entries. Therefore, we expect that mapping the phrase dictionaries on the test dictionaries would result in high recall and low precision while mapping the submitted word alignment data on the test data would result in high precision and low recall. Example 2: sample 91 of test set:  15 x 14 xxx 13 xxx 12 x xxx 11 xxx 10 xxx 09 xxx 08 xxxxxx 07 xxxxxx 06 xxxxxx 05 xxxxxx 04 xxxxxx 03 xxxxxx 02 xxxxxx 01 xxxxxx 00 01234567890123456 Example 3: sample 91 of submission 16  15 x 14 x 13 xx 12 x 11 x 10 x 09 x 08 x 07 x 06 x 05 x 04 x 03 x 02 xxx 01 x 00 01234567890123456"]},{"title":"Phrase-based Evaluation","paragraphs":["Figure 2 shows the correlation of the f-score of the three extracted dictionaries and the word alignment data (both sure and probable). For each submission the f-score was calculated as 2*precision*recall/precision+recall. The curves for the alignment-based dictionaries (align-dic1) show the mean f-score computed over all 447 samples. Roughly all submissions show a similar pattern for word-to-word alignment and phrase dictionaries. We wanted to see what factors influence precision and recall. A correlation between the length of the sample alignment and its average recall and precision is shown Figure 2: f-score of word alignments and dictionaries 0102030405060708090 12345678910111213141516 sure prob align-dic1 text-dic1 text dic2 in figure 3. As one would have expected, the graph shows a tendency that shorter samples are easier to align (higher precision and recall) than longer samples. However, there is higher variation among shorter alignments than among longer sample alignments which indicates unpredictability of shorter samples. As an example consider alignment sample 7 (length 3):","hear, hear ! <-> bravo ! The extracted minimal test dictionary contains the two entries:","hear,hear <-> bravo","! <->! While most of the minimal dictionaries extracted from the submitted data contain the entries:","hear <-> bravo","! <-> ! This leads to a value of 50 for recall and precision for both word and phrase alignments. The average recall and precision of sample 7 (length 3) is 53,1 and 57,8. Figure 3 also shows that PD-recall (phrasal dictionary) is higher than PD-precision as the samples become longer. For example, sample 91 (length 15,5) has PD-recall and PD-precision values of 65, and 50,2 respectively. For word-to-word evaluation, however, WD-precision is higher than WD-recall. For sample 91 (length 15,5) the WD-recall and WD-precision values are 18,03 and 53,86 respectively. Next we wanted to see which parts in the sample alignments would be easy and which parts would be difficult to align. We assume that correct translations which appear in all submissions would be easy to find while translations which occur only in the test set but in none of the submissions would be difficult to find. Finally, the same noisy translations produced by all submissions would indicate mistakes in the test data. The cardinality of these sets is shown in the table below.
