Annotations are based on Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976), in which frames are defined as schematic representations of situations involving various frame elements such as participants, props, and other conceptual roles.","In each FrameNet sentence, a single target predicate is identified and all of its relevant frame elements are tagged with their semantic role (e.g., Agent, Judge), their syntactic phrase type (e.g., NP, PP), and their grammatical function (e.g., external argument, object argument).

The release contains 99,000 annotated frame elements for 1462 distinct lexical predicates (927 verbs, 339 nouns, and 175 adjectives).","While considerable in scale, the FrameNet database does not yet approach the magnitude of resources available for other NLP tasks. Each target predicate, for example, has on average only 30 sentences tagged. This data sparsity makes the task of learning a semantic classifier formidable, and increases the importance of the modeling framework that is employed."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["To our knowledge, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) is the only work to use FrameNet to build a statistically based semantic classifier. They split the problem into two distinct sub-tasks: frame element identification and frame element classification. In the identification phase, syntactic information is extracted from a parse tree to learn the boundaries of the frame elements in a sentence. In the classification phase, similar syntactic information is used to classify those elements into their semantic roles.","In both phases Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) build a model of the conditional probabilities of the classification given a vector of syntactic features. The full conditional probability is decomposed into simpler conditional probabilities that are then interpolated to make the classification. Their best performance on held out test data is achieved using a linear interpolation model: where r is the class to be predicted, x is the vector of syntactic features, xi is a subset of those features, αi is the weight given to that subset conditional probability (as determined using the EM algorithm), and m is the total number of subsets used. Using this method, they report a test set accuracy of 78.5% on classifying semantic roles and precision/recall scores of .726/.631 on frame element identification.","We extend Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)’s initial effort in three ways. First, we adopt a maximum entropy (ME) framework in order to learn a more accurate classification model. Second, we include features that look at previous tags and use previous tag information to find the highest probability semantic role sequence for a given sentence. Finally, we examine sentence-level patterns that exploit more global information in order to classify frame elements.

For example, in the sentence: “Alexandra bent her head;” “Alexandra” is an external argument Noun Phrase, “bent” is a target predicate, and “her head” is an object argument Noun Phrase. Thus, the syntactic pattern associated with the sentence is [NP-ext, target, NP-obj].","These syntactic patterns can be highly in-formative for classification. For example, in the training data, a syntactic pattern of [NPext, target, NP-obj] given the predicate bend was associated 100% of the time with the Frame Element pattern: “AGENT TARGET BODYPART.“","• Previous role (r_n): Frame elements do not occur in isolation, but rather, depend very much on the other elements in a sentence. This dependency can be exploited in classification by using the semantic roles of previously classified frame elements as features in the classification of a current element. This strategy takes advantage of the fact that, for example, if a frame element is tagged as an AGENT it is highly unlikely that the next element will also be an AGENT.","The previous role feature indicates the classification that the n-previous frame element received. During training, this information is provided by simply looking at the true classes of the frame element occurring n positions before the target element. During testing, hypothesized classes of the n elements are used and Viterbi search is performed to find the most probable tag sequence for a sentence."]},{"title":"3.2 Maximum Entropy","paragraphs":["ME models implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constrains imposed by the evidence, but other-wise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).

To examine the effect of optimizing the standard deviation, a range of values was chosen and a classifier was trained using each value until performance on a development set ceased to improve.","The feature functions that we employ can be divided into feature sets based upon the types and combinations of features on which they operate. Table 1 lists the feature sets that we use, as well as the number of individual feature functions they contain. The feature combinations were chosen based both on previous work and trial and error. In future work we will examine more principled feature selection techniques.","To examine the effect of training set size on performance, five data sets were generated from the original set with 36, 367, 3674, 7349, and 24496 sentences, respectively. These data sets were created by going through the original set and selecting every thousandth, hundredth, tenth, fifth, and every second and third sentence, respectively.","It is important to note that the feature functions described here are not equivalent to the subset conditional distributions that are used in the Gildea and Jurafsky model. ME models are log-linear models in which feature functions map specific instances of syntactic features and classes to binary values (e.g., if a training element has head=”in” and role=CAUSE, then, for that element, the feature function f(CAUSE, ”in”) will equal 1). Thus, ME is not here being used as another way to find weights for an interpolated model. Rather, the ME approach provides an overarching framework in which the full distribution of semantic roles given syntactic features can be modeled.           ","We train the ME models using the GIS algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) as implemented in the YASMET ME package (Och, 2002).

There are a number of reasons for this improvement.","First, for this task the log-linear model employed in the ME framework is better than the linear interpolation model used by Gildea and Jurafsky. One possible reason for this is that semantic role classification benefits from the ME model’s bias for more uniform probability distributions that satisfy the constraints placed on the model by the training data.","Another reason for improved performance comes from ME’s simpler design. Instead of having to worry about finding proper backoff strategies amongst distributions of features subsets, ME allows one to include many features in a single model and automatically adjusts the weights of these features appropriately."," Table 3. Confusion matrix for five roles which contribute most to overall system error. Columns refer to actual role. Rows refer to the model’s hypothesis. Other refers to combination of all other roles.

Although many degrees of freedom can lead to overfitting of the training data, the smoothing procedure employed in our experiments helps to counteract this problem. As evidenced in Table 2, by optimizing the standard deviation used in smoothing the ME models are able to show significant increases in performance on held out test data.","Finally, by including in our model sentence-level pattern features and information about previous classes, global information can be exploited for improved classification. The accuracy gained by including such global information confirms the intuition that the semantic role of an element is much related to the entire sentence of which it is a part.","Having discussed the advantages of the models presented here, it is interesting to look at the errors that the system makes. It is clear from the confusion matrix in Table 3 that a great deal of the system error comes from relatively few semantic roles.4","Table 4 offers some insight into why these errors occur. For example, the confusions exemplified in 1 and 2 are both due to the fact that the particular phrases employed can be used in multiple roles (including the roles hypothesized by the system). Thus, while “across the counter” may be considered a goal when one is talking about a person and their head, the same phrase would be considered a path if one were talking about a mouse who is running.  Table 4. Example errors for five of the most often confused semantic roles Actual Proposed Example Sentence 1 Goal Path The barman craned his head","across the counter. 2 Area Path Mr. Glass began hallucinating,","throwing books around the","classroom. 3 Message Speaker Debate lasted until 20 Septem-","ber, opposition being voiced","by a number of Italian and","Spanish prelates. 4 Addressee Speaker Furious staff claim they were","even called in from holiday to","be grilled by a specialist secu-","rity firm 5 Reason Evaluee We cannot but admire the","efficiency with which she","took control of her own life.","","Examples 3 and 4, while showing phrases with similar confusions, stand out as being errors caused by an inability to deal with passive sentences. Such errors are not unexpected; for, even though the voice of the sentence is an explicit feature, the system suffers from the paucity of passive sentences in the data (approximately 5%).","Finally, example 5 shows an error that is based on the difficult nature of the decision itself (i.e., it is unclear whether “the efficiency” is the reason for admiration, or what is being admired). Often times, phrases are assigned semantic roles that are not obvious even to human evaluators. In such cases it is difficult to determine what information might be useful for the system.","Having looked at the types of errors that are common for the system, it becomes interesting to examine what strategy may be best to overcome such errors. Aside from new features, one solution is obvious: more data. The curve in Figure 2 shows that there is still a great deal of performance to be gained by training the current ME models on more data. The slope of the curve indicates that we are far from a plateau, and that even constant increases in the amount of available training data may push classifier performance above 90% accuracy.","Having demonstrated the effectiveness of the ME approach on frame element classification given hand annotated frame element boundaries, we next examine the value of the approach given automatically identified boundaries. "]},{"title":"4 4.1 Frame Element Identification","paragraphs":["Gildea and Jurafsky equate the task of locating frame element boundaries to one of identifying frame elements amongst the parse tree constituents of a given sentence. Because not all frame element boundaries exactly match constituent boundaries, this approach can perform no better than 86.9% (i.e. the number of elements that match constituents (6864) divided by the total number of elements (7899)) on the test set. Features Frame element identification is a binary classification problem in which each constituent in a parse tree is described by a feature vector and, based on that vector, tagged as either a frame element or not. In generating feature vectors we use a subset of the features described for role tagging as well as an additional path feature. ","","Figure 4.

While this experiment only uses three feature sets, the heterogeneity of the path feature is so great that the classifier itself uses 1,119,331 unique binary features.","With the constituents having been labeled, we apply the ME frame element classifier described above.

We attribute this increase to the benefits of the ME framework itself, the incorporation of sentence-level syntactic patterns into our feature set, and the use of previous tag information to find the most probable sequence of roles for a sentence.","But perhaps most striking in our results are the effects of varying training set size on the performance of the classification and identification models. While for classification, the learning curve appears to be still increasing with training set size, the learning curve for identification appears to have already begun to plateau. This suggests that while classification will continue to improve as the FrameNet database gets larger, increased performance on identification will rely on the development of more sophisticated models.","In future work, we intend to apply the lessons learned here to the problem of frame element identification. Gildea and Jurafsky have shown that improvements in identification can be had by more closely integrating the task with classification (they report an F-Score of .719 using an integrated model). We are currently exploring a ME approach which integrates these two tasks under a tagging framework. Initial results show that significant improvements can be had using techniques similar to those described above."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Dan Gildea who generously allowed us access to his data files and Oliver Bender for making the MEtagger software available.
