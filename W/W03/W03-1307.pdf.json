The technique of named entity (NE) recognition (NER) is strongly demanded to be applied in biomedical domain. Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998). However, compared with those in newswire domain, these systems haven’t got high performance. It is probably because of the follow-ing factors of biomedical NE (Zhang et al. 2003):","1. Some modifiers are often before basic NEs, e.g. activated B cell lines, and sometimes biomedical NEs are very long, e.g. 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor. This kind of factor highlights the difficulty for identifying the boundary of NE.","2. Two or more NEs share one head noun by using conjunction or disjunction construction, e.g. 91 and 84 kDa proteins. It is hard to identify these NEs respectively.","3. An entity may be found with various spelling forms, e.g. N-acetylcysteine, N-acetyl-cysteine, NAcetylCysteine, etc. Since the use of capitalization is casual, the capitalization information may not be so evidential in this domain.","4. NE may be cascaded. One NE may be embedded in another NE, e.g. <PROTEIN><DNA> kappa 3</DNA> binding factor </PROTEIN>. More effort must be made to identify this kind of NE.","5. Abbreviations are frequently used in biomedical domain, e.g. TCEd, IFN, TPA, etc. Since abbreviations don’t have many evidences for certain NE class, it is difficult to classify them correctly.","These factors above make NER in biomedical domain difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more evidential features and more effective methods to cope with such difficulties.","In this paper, we will study how to adapt a general Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based NE recognizer (Zhou and Su 2002) to biomedical domain. We specially explore various evidences for biomedical NE and propose methods to cope with abbreviations and cascaded phenomena. As a result, features (simple deterministic features, morphological features, part-of-speech features and head noun trigger features) and methods (abbreviation recognition algorithm and rule-based cascaded phenomena resolution) are integrated in our system. The experiment shows that system outperforms the best published system by 8.1 F-measure.","In Section 2, we will introduce the HMM-based NE recognizer briefly. In Section 3, we will focus on the features that we have used. The methods and the adaptations of different features will be discussed in detail. In Section 5 and 6, we will present the solutions of abbreviation and cascaded phenomena. Finally, our experiment results will be presented and the contributions of different features will be analyzed in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 3 3.1 HMM-based Named Entity Recognizer","paragraphs":["Our system is adapted from a HMM-based NE recognizer, which has been proved very effective in MUC (Zhou and Su 2002).","The purpose of HMM is to find the most likely tag sequence"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["for a given sequence of tokens"]},{"title":"G","paragraphs":["that maximizes . n n"]},{"title":"ttt ⋅⋅⋅=","paragraphs":["211 n"]},{"title":"gg ⋅=","paragraphs":["211"]},{"title":")","paragraphs":["1n"]},{"title":"G","paragraphs":["n"]},{"title":"g⋅⋅ |(","paragraphs":["1n"]},{"title":"TP","paragraphs":["In token sequence"]},{"title":"G","paragraphs":[", the token"]},{"title":"g","paragraphs":["is defined as , where"]},{"title":"w","paragraphs":["is the word and is the feature set related with the word . n 1 i i"]},{"title":">=<","paragraphs":["iii"]},{"title":"wfg ,","paragraphs":["i i"]},{"title":"f w","paragraphs":["In tag sequence"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":[", each tag consists of three parts: 1.

Furthermore, some constraints on the boundary category and entity category between two consecutive tags are applied to filter the invalid NE tags (Zhou and Su 2002)."]},{"title":"Feature Set Simple Deterministic Features (Fsd)","paragraphs":["The purpose of simple deterministic features is to capture the capitalization, digitalization and word formation information. This kind of features have been widely used in both newswire NER system, such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002; Kazama et al. 2002). Based on the characteristics of biomedical NEs, we designed simple deterministic features manually. Table 1 shows the simple deterministic features with descending order of priority."," Fsd Name Example Comma , Dot .

Features such as comma, dot, StopWord, etc. are designed intuitively to provide information to detect the boundary of NE.","2. Features Parenthesis is often used to indicate the definition of abbreviation in biomedical documents.","3. Features GreekLetter and RomanDigit are specially designed to capture the symbols frequently occurred in biomedical NE.","4. Feature ATCG sequence identify the similar-ity of words according to their word formations, e.g. AACAAAG, CTCAGGA, etc.","5. Features dealing with mixed alphabets and digits such as AlphaDigitAlpha, CapMixAlpha, etc. are beneficial for biomedical abbreviations.","Furthermore, we evaluate these features and compare with those used in MUC (Zhou and Su, 2002). The reported result of the simple deterministic features used in MUC can achieve F-measure of 74.1 (Zhou and Su 2002), but when they are used in biomedical domain, they only get F-measure of 24.3. By contrast, using the simple deterministic features we designed for biomedical NER, the system achieves F-measure of 29.4. According to the comparison, some findings may be concluded as follows:","1) Simple deterministic features are domain dependent, which suggests that it is necessary to design special features for biomedical NER.","2) Simple deterministic features have weaker predictive power for NE classes in biomedical domain than in newswire domain. 3.2 Morphological Feature (Fm) Morphological information, such as prefix/suffix, is considered as an important cue for terminology identification. In our system, we get most frequent 100 prefixes and suffixes from training data as candidates. Then, each of these candidates is evaluated according to formula f1."]},{"title":"()","paragraphs":["i ii i N OUTIN Wt","## − = (f1) in which, #INi is the number that prefix/suffix i occurs within NEs; #OUTi is the number that prefix/suffix i occurs out of NEs; Ni is the total number of prefix/suffix i.","The formula assumes that the particular prefix/suffix, which is most likely inside NEs and least likely outside NEs, may be thought as a good evidence for distinguishing the NEs. The candidates with Wt above a certain threshold (0.7 in experiment) are chosen. Then, we calculated the frequency of each prefix/suffix in each NE class and group the prefixes/suffixes with the similar distribution among NE classes into one feature. This is because prefixes/suffixes with the similar distribution have the similar contribution, and it will avoid suffering from the data sparseness problem. Some of morphological features were listed in Table 2."," Fm Name Prefix/Suffix Example sOOC ~cin actinomycin ~mide Cycloheximide ~zole Sulphamethoxazole sLPD ~lipid Phospholipids ~rogen Estrogen ~vitamin dihydroxyvitamin sCTP ~blast erythroblast ~cyte thymocyte ~phil eosinophil sPEPT ~peptide neuropeptide sMA ~ma hybridoma sVIR ~virus cytomegalovirus","Table 2: Examples of morphological features","","From Table 2, the suffixes ~cin, ~mide, ~zole have been grouped into one feature sOOC because they all have the high frequency in the NE class OtherOrganicCompound and relatively low frequencies in the other NE classes. In our system, totally 37 prefixes and suffixes were selected and grouped to 23 features. 3.3 Part-of-Speech Features (Fpos) In the previous NER research in newswire domain, part-of-speech (POS) features were stated not useful, as POS features may affect the use of some important capitalization information (Zhou and Su 2002). However, since more and more words with lower case are included in NEs, capitalization information in biomedical domain is not as evidential as it in newswire domain (Zhang et al. 2003). Moreover, since many biomedical NEs are descriptive and long, identifying NE boundary is not a trivial task. POS tagging can provide the evidence of noun phrase region based on word syntactic information and the noun phrases are most likely to be NE. Therefore, we reconsidered the POS tagging.","In previous research, (Kazama et al. 2002) make use of POS information and conclude that it only slightly improves performance. Moreover, (Collier et al. 2000; Nobata et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier. 2002) don’t incorporate POS information in their systems. The probable reason explained by them is that since POS tagger they used is trained on newswire articles, the assigned POS tags are often incorrect in biomedical documents. On the whole, it can be concluded that POS information hasn’t been well used in previous work.","In our experiment, a POS tagger was trained using 80% of GENIA V2.1 corpus (536 abstracts, 123K words) and evaluated on the rest 20% (134 abstracts, 29K words). We use GENIA corpus to train the POS tagger in order to let it be adapted for biomedical domain. As for comparison, we also trained the POS tagger on Wall Street Journal articles (2500 articles, 756K words) and tested on the 20% of GENIA corpus. The results are shown in Table 3.","","Training set Testing set Precision 2500 WSJ articles 84.31 536 GENIA abstracts","134 GENIA","abstracts 97.37 Table 3: Comparison of POS tagger using different training data","","From Table 3, it can be found that POS tagger trained on the biomedical documents performs much better on the biomedical testing documents than that trained on WSJ articles. This is consistent with earlier explanation for why POS features are not so useful in biomedical NER (Nobata et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002). 3.4 Semantic Trigger Features Semantic trigger features are collected to capture the evidence of certain NE class based on the semantic information of some key words. Initially, we design two types of semantic triggers: head noun triggers and special verb triggers. 3.4.1 Head Noun Triggers (Fhnt) Head noun means the main noun or noun phrase of some compound words and describes the function or the property, e.g. “B cells” is the head noun for the NE “activated human B cells”. Compared with the other words in NE, head noun is a much more decisive factor for distinguishing NE classes. For instance, <OtherName>IFN-gamma treatment</OtherName> <DNA>IFN-gamma activation sequence</DNA>","In our work, we extract uni-gram and bi-grams of head nouns automatically from training data, and rank them by frequency. According to the experiment, we selected 60% top ranked head nouns as trigger features for each NE class. Some examples are shown in Table 4.","In the future application, we may also extract the head nouns from some public resources to enhance the triggers."," 1-gram 2-grams PROTEIN interleukin activator protein interferon binding protein kinase cell receptor ligand gene product CELL TYPE lymphocyte blast cell astrocyte blood lymphocyte eosinophil killer cell fibroblast peripheral monocyte DNA DNA X chromosome breakpoint alpha promoter cDNA binding motif chromosome promoter element Table 4: Examples of head noun triggers 3.4.2 Special Verb Triggers (Fsvt) Besides collecting the triggers, such as head noun triggers, from the NEs themselves, we also extract the triggers from the local contexts of the NEs. Recently, some frequently occurred verbs in biomedical document have been proved useful for extracting the interaction between entities (Thomas et al. 2000; Sekimizu et al. 1998). In biomedical NER, we have the intuition that particular verbs may also provide the evidence for boundary and NE class. For instance, the verb bind is often used to indicate the interaction between proteins.","In our system, we selected 20 most frequent verbs which occur adjacent to NE from training data automatically as the verb trigger features, which is shown in Table 5.",""," Special Verb Triggers activate express bind induce inhibit interact regulate stimulate Table 5: Examples of special verb triggers"]},{"title":"4 Method for Abbreviation Recognition","paragraphs":["Abbreviations are widely used in biomedical domain. Identifying the class of them constitutes an important and difficult problem (Zhang et al. 2003).","In our current system, we incorporate a method to classify abbreviation by mapping the abbreviation to its full form. This approach is based on the assumption that it is easier to classify the full form than abbreviation. In most cases, this assumption is valid because the full form has more evidences than its abbreviation to capture the NE class. Moreover, if we can map the abbreviation to its full form in the current document, the recognized abbreviation is still helpful for classifying the same forthcoming abbreviations in the same document, as in (Zhou and Su 2002).","In practice, abbreviation and its full form often occur simultaneously with parenthesis when first appear in biomedical documents. There are two cases:","1. full form (abbreviation)","2. abbreviation (full form)","Most patterns conform to the first case and if the content inside the parenthesis includes more than two words, the second case is assumed (Schwartz and Hearst 2003).","In these two cases, the use of parenthesis is both evidential and confusing. On one hand, it is evidential because it can provide the indication to map the abbreviation to its full form. On the other hand, it is confusing because it makes the annotation of NE more complicated. Sometimes, the abbreviation and its full form are annotated separately, such as <CellType>human mononulear leukocytes</CellType>(<CellType>hMNL</CellType>), and sometimes, they are all embedded in the whole entity, such as <OtherName>leukotriene B4 (LTB4) genera-tion</OtherName>. Therefore, parenthesis needs to be treated specially. We develop an abbreviation recognition algorithm described in Figure 1.","In preprocessing stage, we remove the abbreviations and parentheses from the sentence, when the abbreviation is first defined. This measure will make the annotation simpler and the NE recognizer more effective. The main work in this stage is to judge which case the current pattern belongs to and record the original positions of the abbreviation and parenthesis.","After applying the HMM-based NE recognizer to the sentence, we restore the abbreviation and parenthesis to the original position in the sentence. Next, the abbreviation is classified. There are two priorities of the class (from high to low): the class of its full form identified by the recognizer, and the class of the abbreviation itself identified by the recognizer. At last, the same abbreviation occur-ring in the rest sentences of the current document are assigned the same NE class."," for each sentence Si in the document{","if exist parenthesis{","judge the case of {","“full form (abbr.)”;","“abbr.

Currently, we only consider the longest NE and ignore the embedded NEs.","Based on the features described in section 3, our system counters some problems when dealing with cascaded NEs. The probable reason is that the features we used are not so effective for this kind of NEs.","For instance, POS is based on the assumption that NE is most likely to be a noun phrase. For cascaded NE, this assumption may not always be valid because one NE may consist of two or more noun phrases connected by some special words, such as TSH receptor specific T cell lines.","Moreover, in section 3.4.1, we have shown that head noun is the significant clue for distinguishing NE classes. Even for cascaded NEs, head noun features are still effective to some extent, such as IL-2 mRNA. However, cascaded NEs sometimes contain two or more head nouns, which belong to different NE classes. For example, <DNA>IgG Fc receptor type IC gene</DNA>, in which receptor is the head noun of protein and gene is the head noun of DNA. In general, the latter head noun will be more important. Unfortunately, it seems that sometimes the shorter NE is more possible to be identified, such as <protein>IgG Fc receptor</protein> type IC gene.","On the whole, we have to explore an additional method to cope with the cascaded phenomena separately. In our experiment, we attempt to solve this problem based on some rules.","In GENIA corpus, we find that there are four basic types of cascaded NEs:","1. < <NE> head noun >","2. < modifier <NE> >","3. < <NE1> <NE2> >","4. < <NE1> word <NE2> > Moreover, these cascaded NEs may be generated iteratively. For instance,","5. < modifier <NE> head noun >","6. < <NE1> <NE2> head noun >","The rules are constructed automatically from the cascaded NEs in training data. Corresponding to the four basic types of cascaded NEs mentioned before, we propose four patterns and apply them iteratively in each sentence: 1. <entity1> head noun ̆<entity2> e.g. <Protein> binding motif ̆<DNA> 2. <entity1> <entity2> ̆<entity3> e.g. <Lipid> <Protein> ̆<Protein> 3. modifier <entity1> ̆<entity2> e.g. anti <Protein> ̆<Protein> 4. <entity1> word <entity2> ̆<entity3> e.g. <Virus> infected <Multicell> ̆<Multicell>","In our system, 102 rules are incorporated to classify the cascaded NEs."]},{"title":"6 6.1 6.2 Experiments GENIA Corpus","paragraphs":["GENIA corpus is the largest annotated corpus in molecular biology domain available to public (Ohta et al. 2002).

This probably benefits from the various evidential features and the effective methods we proposed. Furthermore, as our expectation, the performance achieved on V3.0 (66.1 F-measure) is better than that on V1.1 (62.5 F-measure), which indicate that our system still has some room for improvement with the larger training data set."," ","Figure 2: Performance of each NE class","","In addition, Figure 2 shows the detailed performance chart of each NE class on V3.0.
