Capturing named entities is a fundamental task to understanding documents (MUC, 1998). Several approaches have been proposed to recognize these types of terms. For example, corpus-based methods are employed to extract Chinese personal names, and rule-based methods are used to extract Chinese date/time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions (Chen and Lee, 1996; Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998). In the past, named entity extraction mainly focuses on general domains and is employed to various applications such as information retrieval (Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998), question-answering (Lin, et al., 2001), and so on. Recently, several attempts have been extended to mine knowledge from biomedical documents (Hirschman, et al., 2002).","Most of the previous approaches dealt with monolingual named entity extraction. Chen et al. (1998) extended it to cross-language information retrieval. A grapheme-based model was proposed to compute the similarity between Chinese transliteration name and English name. Lin and Chen (2000) further classified the works into two directions – say, forward transliteration (Wan and Verspoor, 1998) and backward transliteration (Chen et al., 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998), and proposed a phoneme-based model. Lin and Chen (2002) employed a machine learning approach to determine phonetic similarity scores for machine transliteration. AI-Onaizan and Knight (2002) investigated the translation of Arabic named entities to English using monolingual and bilingual resources.","The past works on multilingual named entities emphasizes on the transliteration issues. However, the transformation between named entities in different languages is not transliteration only. The mapping may be a combination of meaning translation and/or phoneme transliteration. The following five English-Chinese examples show this issue. The symbol A ⇔ B denotes a foreign name A is translated and/or transliterated into a Chinese name B."," (s1) Victoria Fall","⇔ 維多利亞瀑布 (wei duo li ya pu bu) (s2) Little Rocky Mountains","⇔ 小落磯山脈 (xiao luo ji shan mo) (s3) Great Salt Lake ⇔ 大鹽湖 (da yan hu) (s4) Kenmare ⇔ 康美爾 (kang mei er) (s5) East Chicago ⇔ 東芝加哥 (dong zhi jia ge)  Example (s1) shows a name part (i.e., Victoria) and a keyword part (i.e., Fall) of a named location are transliterated and translated into “維多利亞” (wei duo li ya) and “瀑布” (pu bu), respectively. In Example (s2), the keyword part (i.e., Mountains) is still translated, i.e., “山脈” (shan mo), however, some part of name is translated (i.e., Little ⇔ “小” (xiao)) and another part is transliterated (i.e., Rocky ⇔ “落磯” (luo ji)). Example (s3) shows an extreme case. All the three words are translated (i.e., Great ⇔ “大” (da)), Salt ⇔ “鹽” (yan), Lake ⇔ “湖” (hu)). Examples (s4) and (s5) show two location names without keywords. The former is transliterated and the latter is a combination of transliteration and translation.","Which part is translated and which part is transliterated depends on the type of named entities. For example, personal names tend to be transliterated. For a location name, name part and keyword part are usually transliterated and translated, respectively. The organization names are totally different. Most of constituents are translated. Besides the issue of the named entity types, different language pairs have different transformation rules. German named entity has decompounding problem when it is translated/transliterated, e.g., Bundesbahn ⇔ “聯 邦鐵路局” (lian bang tie lu ju) and Bundesbank ⇔ “聯邦銀行” (lian bang yin hang).","This paper will study the issues of languages and named entity types on the choices of translation and transliteration. We focus on three more challenging named entities only, i.e., named people, named locations and named organizations. Three phrase-aligned corpora will be adopted – say, a multilingual personal name corpus and a multilingual organization name corpus compiled by Central News Agency (abbreviated CNA personal name and organization corpora hereafter), and a multilingual location name corpus compiled by National Institute for Compilation and Translation of Taiwan (abbreviated NICT location name corpus hereafter). We will extract transliteration/translation rules from these multilingual named corpora. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the corpora used. Section 3 shows how to extract formulation rules and the transformation rules. Section 4 analyzes the results. Section 5 demonstrates the application of the extracted rules on cross language information retrieval. Section 6 concludes the remarks."]},{"title":"2 Multilingual Named Entity Corpora","paragraphs":["NICT location name corpus which was developed by Ministry of Education of Taiwan in 1995 collected 19,385 foreign location names. Each entry consists of three parts, including foreign location name, Chinese transliteration/translation name, and country name, e.g., (Victoria Fall, “維 多利亞瀑布” (wei duo li ya pu bu), South Africa), (Little Rocky Mountains, “小落磯山脈” (xiao luo ji shan mo), USA), etc. The foreign location names are in English alphabet. Some location names denoting the same city have more than one form like Firenze and Florence for a famous Italian city. The former is an Italian name and the latter is its English name. They correspond to two different transliterations in Chinese, respectively, i.e., “翡冷翠” (fei leng cui) and “佛羅倫斯” (fo luo lun si). The pronunciation of the foreign names in NICT corpus is based on Webster’s New Geographic Dictionary. The foreign name itself may be a transliteration name. A Japanese city is transliterated in English alphabet, but its corresponding translation name is in Kanji (Hanzi in Japanese). It is hard to capture their relationships except dictionary lookup, so that Japanese location name is out of our discussion. We employ the country field to select the translation/transliteration pairs that we will deal with in this paper. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of NICT corpus based on country tags.","","Table 1.

There are 50,586 pairs of foreign personal names and Chinese transliteration/translation in persona name corpus. Different from NICT corpus, there do not exist clear cues to identify the nationality of named people. Thus, we could not exclude the Japanese names like “Hayakawa” and the corresponding name “ 早川” (zao chuan) from our discussion automatically. There are 14,658 named organizations in CNA corpus. Some organization names are tagged with the country names to which they belong. For example, “Aachen Technical University” ⇔ 亞肯技術大學 (ya ken ji shu da xue) (Germany). But not all the organization names have such country tags. Comparatively, organization names are longer than the other two named entities. Table 2 shows the statistics of NICT organization name corpus. FL denotes the length of foreign names in words, CL denotes the length of Chinese names in characters, and Count denotes the number of foreign names of the specified length."]},{"title":"3 Rule Mining 3.1 Frequency-Based Approach with a Bilingual Dictionary","paragraphs":["We postulate that a transliterated term is usually an unknown word, i.e., not listed in a lexicon and a translated term often appears in a lexicon. Under this postulation, a translated term occurs more often in a corpus, and comparatively, a transliterated term only appears very few.","A simple frequency-based method will compute the frequencies of terms and use them to tell out the transliteration and translation parts in a named entity. Because Chinese has segmentation problem, we start the frequency computation from the foreign name part in a multilingual named entity corpus. The method is sketched as follows.","(1) Compute the word frequencies of each word in the foreign name list.","(2) Keep those words that appear more than a threshold and appear in a common foreign dictionary (e.g., an English dictionary). These words form candidates of simple keywords.","(3) Examine the foreign word list again.","","Table 2. Statistics of CNA Organization Corpus FL Count CL FL Count CL FL Count CL 1 1,773 4.73 7 425 9.94 13 10 14.20 2 3,622 4.98 8 223 10.50 14 6 12.00 3 3,751 6.30 9 122 10.98 15 5 17.00 4 2,406 7.28 10 53 11.57 16 2 14.50 5 1,434 8.27 11 32 13.41 18 1 9.00 6 775 8.97 12 17 12.35 20 1 15.00  Those word strings that are composed of simple keyword candidates are candidates of compound keywords. We find out the compound keyword set by using collocation metric by selecting the most frequently occurring compounds through the wellknown elimination of prepositions.","(4)Because the experimental corpus is aligned, we can cluster the Chinese name list based on foreign keywords. For each Chinese name cluster, we try to identify the Chinese keyword sets. Here a bilingual dictionary may be consulted.","The above algorithm extracts foreign/Chinese keyword sets from a multilingual named entity corpus. In the meantime, formulation rules for foreign names and Chinese counterparts are mined. A complete foreign name and a complete Chinese name are mapped into name-keyword combination. By the way, which method, translation or transliteration, is used is also determined.","Take NICT location name corpus as an example. The terms of frequencies greater than 20 include River (河, he), Island (島, dao), Lake (湖, hu), Mountain (山, shan), Bay (灣, wan), Mountain (峰, feng), Peak (峰, feng), Islands (群島, qun dao), Mountains (山脈, shan mo), Cape (角, jiao), City (城, cheng), Range (嶺, ling), Peninsula (半島, ban dao), Point (角, jiao), Strait (海峽, hai xia), River (川, chuan), Gulf (灣, wan), Cape (岬, jia), Pass ( 山口, shan kou), Plateau ( 高原, gao yuan), Headland (岬, jia), Harbor (港, gang), Sea (海, hai), Promontory (岬, jia), and Hills (丘陵, qui ling). On the one hand, a foreign location keyword, e.g., “Mountain”, may correspond to two Chinese location keywords, e.g., “ 山 ” (shan) and “ 峰 ” (feng). On the other hand, the same Chinese location keyword “峰” (feng) can be translated into two English location keywords “Mountain” and “Peak”.","Similarly, suffix and prefix for organization names can be extracted from CNA organization name corpus. Some high frequent keywords are shown as follows.","(1) Suffix","Party (黨, dang), Association (協會, xie hui), University (大學, da xue), Co. (公司, gong si), Committee (委員會, wei yuan hui), Company (公司, gong si), Bank (銀行, yia hang), etc.","(2) Prefix","International (國際, guo ji), World (世界, shi jie), American (美國, mei guo), National (全國, quan guo), Japan (日本, ri ben), National (國家, guo jia), Asian (亞洲, ya zhou), etc."]},{"title":"3.2 Keyword Extraction without a Bilingual Dictionary","paragraphs":["At the step (4) of the algorithm in Section 3.1, a bilingual dictionary is required. Because abbreviation is common adopted in translation, dictionary-based approach is hard to capture this phenomenon. A named organization “World Taiwanese Association” which is translated into “世台會” (shi tai hui) is a typical example. The term “World” is translated into an abbreviated term “世” (shi) rather than a complete term “世界” (shi jie). Here another approach without dictionary is proposed. Suppose there are M pairs of (foreign name, Chinese name) in a multilingual named entity corpus. The jth","pair, 1 ≤ j ≤ M, is denoted by {Ej, Cj}, where Ej is a foreign named entity, and Cj is a Chinese named entity. Then some Chinese segment c ∈ Cj should be associated with some foreign segment e ∈ Ej. Consider the following examples.","","(s6) Aletschhorn Mountain ⇔ 阿利奇赫恩山","(s7) Catalan Mountain ⇔ 卡太蘭山","(s8) Cook Strait ⇔ 科克海峽","(s9) Dover, Strait of ⇔多佛海峽"," We will align “山” (shan) and “海峽” (hai xia) to Mountain and Strait, respectively, from these examples.","We further decompose the named entities. If a named entity Ej comprises m words w1·w2...wm, then a candidate segment ep, q is defined as wp ... wq, where 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ m. If a Chinese named entity Cj has n syllables s1·s2...sn, then a candidate segment cx, y is defined as sx ... sy, where 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ n. Theoretically, we can get 2 )1(","2 )1( + ×+ nnmm pairs of {ep, q, cx, y} from {Ej, Cj}. We then group the pairs collected from the multilingual named entity list and count the frequency for each occurrence. Those pairs with higher frequency denote significant segment pairs. In the above examples, both the two pairs {Mountain, “山” (shan)} and {Strait, “海峽” (hai xia)} appear twice, while the other pairs appear only once.","All the pairs {e, c} whose frequency > 2 are kept. Two issues have to be addressed. The first is: redundancy which may exist in the pairs of segments should be eliminated carefully. If a pair {e, s1 s2 ... st} occurs k times, then the frequency of t×(t+1)/2 substrings (1 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ t) is at least k. The second is: e may be translated to more than one synonym, which has the same prefix, suffix, or infix. In examples (s10) and (s11), “Association” may be translated into “協會” (xie hui) and “聯誼 會” (lian yi hui), where “會” (hui) is a common suffix of these two translation equivalents, so that its frequency is more than the translation equivalents."," (s10) World Trade Association ⇔ 世界貿易協會 (s11) North Europe Chinese Association ⇔","北歐華人聯誼會"," These two issues may be mixed together to make this problem more challengeable.","A metric to deal with the above issues is proposed. The concept is borrowed from tf×idf scheme in information retrieval to measure the alignment of each foreign segment and the possible Chinese translation segments. Assume there are N foreign segments. Term frequency (tf) of a Chinese translation segment ci in e denotes the number of occurrences of ci in e. Document frequency (df) of ci is the number of foreign segments that ci is translated to. We prefer to the Chinese translation segment that occur frequently in a specific foreign segment, but rarely in the remainder of foreign segments. Besides, we also prefer the longer Chinese segment, so that the length of a Chinese segment, i.e., |ci|, is also considered.","=}),({ icescore",")1|(|log)(}),({ 2 +×× iii ccidfcef (1) }),{(max }),({ }),({ jj","i","i","cetf cetf","cef = (2) ) )( (log)( 2 i i","cdf N cidf = , (3)","For some e, the corresponding Chinese segment c","is obtained by equation (4).","}),({maxarg i c cescorec i= (4) In this way, we can produce a ranking list of pairs of (foreign segment, Chinese segment), which form multilingual keyword pairs."]},{"title":"3.3 Extraction of Transformation Rules","paragraphs":["We apply the keyword pairs extracted in the last section to the original named entity list.

In contrast, the English compound keyword is connected in (s14) and (s15), but the corresponding Chinese translation is separated. The phenomenon appears quite often in the translation of organization names.","We introduce a symbol ∆ to cope with the distance issue. The original algorithm is modified as follows. A candidate segment cp, q is defined as a string that begins with sp and ends with sq. Each syllable from sp-1 to sq-1 can be replaced by ∆.

In other words, 13,208 named locations are single words, and they are unique, so that we cannot extract keywords from these words. Total 122 keyword pairs are identified. We classify these keyword pairs into the following types: ","(1) Meaning translation Total 69 keywords belong to this type. It occupies 56.56%. They are further classified into three subtypes.

Besides, some common transliteration names are also regarded as keywords, e.g., Elizabeth ⇔","伊利莎白 (yi li sha bai), Edward ⇔ 愛德華","(ai de hua), etc. Total 39 terms belong to","this type.

On the average, a keyword pair corresponds to 1.89 transformation rules. Consider a keyword pair mountain ⇔ 山 (shan) as an example. Four transformation rules shown as follows are learned, where α and β denote keywords for foreign language and Chinese, respectively; δ is a Chinese transliteration of a foreign fragment γ; the number enclosed in parentheses denotes frequency the rule is applied.","(1) γα ⇔ δβ (234)","(2) γ, α ⇔ δβ (45)","(3) γ, αγ ⇔ δβ (1)","(4) γαγ ⇔ δβ (1) When we apply the 230 transformation rules back to the 5,714 named locations, we can tell out which part is transliterated and which part is translated from 4,262 named locations.

There are 14,658 records in CNA organization corpus. Total 12,885 organization names are composed of more than one word. The percentage, 87.90%, is the highest among these three corpora. Besides that, 5,229 keyword pairs are extracted. Most of the keyword pairs are meaning translated. This set is also the largest among the three corpora. Thus, the keyword pairs are too small and too large to find suitable transformation rules for personal names and organization names, respectively.","Although the original idea of our algorithm is universal for languages, it should be modified slightly for some specific languages. The following takes German as examples. German words have cases and genders. Most of German words are compound. Consider examples (s16)- (s19).  (s16) Neue Osnabruecker ⇔ 新奧斯納布律報 (s17) Neues Deutschland ⇔ 新德國 (s18) Bundesbahn ⇔ 聯邦鐵路局 (s19) Bundesbank ⇔ 聯邦銀行  The first two examples show the German adjective Neu (New) has different suffixes such as “-e” and “-es” according to the case and gender of the noun. The last two examples suggest that morphological analysis for decompounding the words into meaningful segments is necessary before our algorithm.

Because named entities are key components of a document, they are usually targets that users are interested in. Figure 1 shows an application of the extracted formulation rules and transformation rules on Chinese-Foreign CLIR. For each document in the Foreign collection, named entities are recognized and classified by using formulation rules. They form important indices for the related documents. When a Chinese query is issued, the system extracts the possible Chinese named entities according to Chinese formulation rules. If keywords are specified in a query, we know the structure and the type of the named entity. The lexical structure tells us which part is translated and which part is transliterated.","The backward transliteration method proposed by Lin and Chen (2000, 2002) was followed to select the most similar English named entity and the related documents at the same time. In Lin and Chen’s approach, both Chinese name and English candidates will be transformed into a canonical form in terms of International Phonetic Alphabets.

Simple frequency-based method identifies keywords of named entities for individual languages and their correspondence. The modified tf×idf scheme deals with the issues of abbreviation and compound keyword at a distance.","Since the corpora are already phrase-aligned, the mined rules cover at least a significant number of instances. That is, they seem to be significant, but further evaluation is needed. Two types of evaluation are being conducted, i.e., direct and indirect approaches. In the former, we will partition the corpora into two parts, one for training and the other one for testing. In the latter, we are integrating our method in a cross language information retrieval system. Given a query consisting of Chinese named entity, the Chinese formulation rules will tell us its type and lexical structures. The transformation rules show which parts should be translated and transliterated. Our previous works on phoneme transliteration is integrated. The transformation result may be submitted to an information retrieval system to access documents in another language. In the ongoing evaluation, the test bed is supported by CLEF (2003). The result will be reported in CLEF2003 after evaluation by CLEF organizer. Further applications will be explored in the future and the methodology will be extended to other types of named entities.
