Examples have been class-based","-gram models (Brown et al., 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993), smoothing techniques for structural disambiguation (Li and Abe, 1998) and word sense disambiguation (Shütze, 1998).","In this paper, we define a general form for class-based probabilistic language models, and propose an efficient and model-theoretic algorithm for clustering based on this. The algorithm involves three operations, CLASSIFY, MERGE, and SPLIT, all of which decreases the optimization function based on the MDL principle (Rissanen, 1984), and can efficiently find a point near the local optimum. The algorithm is applicable to more general tasks than existing studies (Li and Abe, 1998; Berkhin and Becher, 2002), and computational costs are significantly small, which allows its application to very large corpora.","Clustering algorithms may be classified into three types. The first is a type that uses various heuristic measure of similarity between the elements to be clustered and has no interpretation as a probability model (Widdow, 2002). The resulting clusters from this type of method are not guaranteed to work effectively as a component of a statistical language model, because the similarity used in clustering is not derived from the criterion in the learning process of the statistical model, e.g. likelihood. The second type has clear interpretation as a probability model, but no criteria to determine the number of clusters (Brown et al., 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993). The performance of methods of this type depend on the number of clusters that must be specified before the clustering process. It may prove rather troublesome to determine the proper number of clusters in this type of method. The third has interpretation as a probability model and uses some statistically motivated model selection criteria to determine the proper number of clusters. This type has a clear advantage compared to the second. AutoClass (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1996), the Bayesian model merging method (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1996) and Li’s method (Li, 2002) are examples of this type. AutoClass and the Bayesian model merging are based on soft clustering models and Li’s method is based on a hard clustering model. In general, computational costs for hard clustering models are lower than that for soft clustering models. However, the time complexity of Li’s method is of cubic order in the size of the vocabulary. Therefore, it is not practical to apply it to large corpora.","Our model and clustering algorithm provide a solution to these problems with existing clustering algorithms. Since the model has clear interpretation as a probability model, the clustering algorithm uses MDL as clustering criteria and using a combination of top-down clustering, bottom-up clustering, and a K-means style exchange algorithm, the method we propose can perform the clustering efficiently.","We evaluated the algorithm through experiments on a disambiguation task of Japanese dependency analysis. In the experiments, we observed that the proposed algorithm’s computation time is roughly linear to the size of the vocabulary, and it performed slightly better than the existing method. Our main intention in the experiments was to see improvements in terms of computational cost, not in performance in the test task. We will show, in Sections 2 and 3, that the proposed method can be applied to a broader range of tasks than the test task we evaluate in the experiments in Section 4. We need further experiments to determine the performance of the proposed method with more general tasks."]},{"title":"2 Probability model 2.1 Class-based language modeling","paragraphs":["Our probability model is a class-based model and it is an extension of the model proposed by Li and Abe (1998). We extend their two-dimensional class model to a multidimensional class model, i.e., we incorporate an arbitrary number of random variables in our model.","Although our probability model and learning algorithm are general and not restricted to particular domains, we mainly intend to use them in natural language processing tasks where large amounts of lexical knowledge are required. When we incorporate lexical information into a model, we inevitably face the data-sparseness problem. The idea of ‘word class’ (Brown et al., 1992) gives a general solution to this problem. A word class is a group of words which performs similarly in some linguistic phenomena. Part-of-speech are well-known examples of such classes. Incorporating word classes into linguistic models yields good smoothing or, hopefully, meaningful generalization from given samples. 2.2 Model definition","Let us introduce some notations to define our model.

We it-eratively invoke these until a terminate condition is met. Briefly, these three work as follows. The CLASSIFY takes a partition","in","as input and improves the partition by moving the elements in","from one class to another. This operation is similar to one iteration in the K-means algorithm. The MERGE takes a partition","as input and successively chooses two classes","","and","","from ","and replaces them with their union,","","","","",". The SPLIT takes a class,",", and tries to find the best division of into two new classes, which will decrease the description length the most.","All of these three basic operations decrease the description length. Consequently, our overall algorithm also decreases the description length monotonically and stops when all three operations cause no decrease in description length. Strictly, this termination does not guarantee the resulting partitions to be even locally optimal, because SPLIT operations do not perform exhaustive searches in all possible divisions of a class. Doing such an exhaustive search is almost impossible for a class of modest size, because the time complexity of such an exhaustive search is of exponential order to the size of the class. However, by properly selecting the number of trials in SPLIT, we can expect the results to approach some local optimum.","It is clear that the way the three operations are combined affects the performance of the resulting class-based model and the computation time required in learning. In this paper, we basically take a top-down, divisive strategy, but at each stage of division we do CLASSIFY operations on the set of classes at each stage. When we cannot divide any classes and CLASSIFY cannot move any elements, we invoke MERGE to merge classes that are too finely divided. This top-down strategy can drastically decrease the amount of computation time compared to the bottom-up approaches used by Brown et al. (1992) and Li and Abe (1998).","The following is the precise algorithm for our main procedure:","Algorithm 1 MAIN PROCEDURE( ) INPUT"," : an integer specifying the number of trials in a","SPLIT operation","OUTPUT","Partitions     ","","and estimated parameters in the","model PROCEDURE","Step 0","","","","","","",""," INITIALIZE","","","","","","","","","","Step 1 Do Step 2 through Step 3 until no change is made through one iteration","Step 2 Fo r","    ",", do Step 2.1 through Step 2.2 Step 2.1 Do Step 2.1.1 until no change occurs through it","Step 2.1.1 Fo r","","","",""," ,","","","CLASSIFY","","","","Step 2.2 For each","",""," , ","SPLIT","","","","Step 3 Fo r","","",""," , ","","MERGE","","","","Step 4 Return the resulting partitions with the parameters in the model","In the Step 0 of the algorithm, INITIALIZE creates","the initial partitions of","","","",".

Through this, we can conclude","that the summation (6) is","",". Therefore,","","","","","holds, i.e., CLASSIFY increases log likelihood monoton-","ically. 3.2 SPLIT operation The SPLIT takes a class as input and tries to find a way to divide it into two sub-classes in such a way as to reduce description length. As mentioned earlier, to find the best division in a class requires computation time that is exponential to the size of the class. We will first use a brute-force approach here. Let us simply try","random divisions, rearrange them with CLASSIFY and use the best one. If the best division does not reduce the description length, we will not change the class at all. It may possible to use a more sophisticated initialization scheme, but this simple method yielded satisfactory results in our experiment.","The following is the precise algorithm for SPLIT:","Algorithm 3 SPLIT( ,",") INPUT  : a class to be split  : an integer specifying the number of trials","OUTPUT","Two new classes  and","","on success, or","with","no modifications on failure PROCEDURE Step 1 Do Steps 2.1 through 2.3 J times","Step 2.1 Randomly divide into two classes Step 2.2 Apply CLASSIFY to these two classes","Step 2.3 Record the resulting two classes in Step 2.2 with the reduced description length produced by this split Step 3 Find the maximum reduction in the records","Step 4 If this maximum reduction","",", return the corre-","sponding two classes as output, or return","if the","maximum ","Clearly, this operation decreases   ","","on success","and does not change it on failure. 3.3 MERGE operation","The MERGE takes partition","as input and successively","chooses two classes ","and","","from","and replaces them","with their union","   ",". This operation thus reduces the","number of classes in and accordingly reduces the num-","ber of parameters in the model. Therefore, if we properly","choose the ‘redundant’ classes in a partition, this merging","reduces the description length by the greater reduction in","the model description length which surpasses the loss in","log-likelihood.","Our MERGE is almost the same procedure as that de-","scribed by Li (2002).

A bunsetsu consists of one or more content words and zero or more function words that follow these.","For example, the Japanese sentence Ryoushi-ga kawa-de oyogu nezumi-wo utta. hunter-SUBJ river-in swim mouse-OBJ shot (A hunter shot a mouse which swam in the river.) contains five bunsetsus","Ryoushi-ga, kawa-de, oyogu, nezumi-wo, utta","and their dependency relations are as follows:","Ryoushi-ga","utta kawa-de","oyogu","oyogu","nezumi-wo nezumi-wo","utta","Our task is, given an input bunsetsu, to output the correct bunsetsu on which the input bunsetsu depends. In this task, we considered the dependency relations of limited types. That is the dependency of types: noun-pp pred , where noun is a noun, or the head of a compound noun, pp is one of 9 postpositions","ga, wo, ni, de, to, he, made, kara, yori","and pred is a bunsetsu which contains a verb or an adjective as its content word part. We restricted possible dependee bunsetsus to be those to the right of the input bunsetsus because in Japanese, basically all dependency relations are from left to right.

We extracted all the positive (i.e.,","",") and negative (","","",") relation samples and divided them into 10 disjunctive sets for 10-fold cross validation. When we divided the samples, all the relations extracted from one sentence were put together in one of 10 sets. When a set was used as the test data, these relations from one sentence were used as the test data of the form (Eq.8). Of course, we did not use samples with only one pred. In the results in the next subsection, the ‘training data of size","’ means where we used a subset of positive samples that were covered by the most frequent","nouns and the most frequent","pp:pred pairs. 4.2 Results In this experiments, we compared three methods: ours, Li’s described in Li (2002), and a restricted version of our method that only uses CLASSIFY operations. The last method is simply called ‘the CLASSIFY method’ in this subsection. We used 10 as parameter","in our method, which specifies the number of trials in initialization and each SPLIT operation. Li’s method (2002) uses the MDL principle as clustering criteria and creates word classes in a bottom-up fashion. Parameters","","and","","in his method, which specify the maximum numbers of successive merges in each dimension, were both set to 100. The CLASSIFY method performs K-means style itera-tive clustering and requires that the number of clusters be specified beforehand. We set these to be the same as the number of clusters created by our method in each training set. By evaluating the differences in the performance of ours and the CLASSIFY method, we can see advantages in our top-down approach guided by the MDL principle, compared to the K-means style approach that uses a fixed number of clusters.We expect that these advantages will remain when compared to other previously reported, K-means style methods (Kneser and Ney, 1993; Berkhin and Becher, 2002; Dhillon et al., 2002).","In the results, precision refers to the ratio","","","",""," and coverage refers to the ratio",", where","and","denote the numbers of correct and wrong predictions, and","denotes the number of all test data.

The results of the Li’s method on training set of 8k were the averages over two training-test pairs. We could not do more trials with Li’s method due to time constraints. All experiments were done on Pentium III 1.2-GHz computers and the reported computation times are wall-clock times.","Figure 1 shows the computation time as a function of the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the number of nouns plus the number of case frame slots (i.e., pp:pred) in the training data. We can clearly see the efficiency of our method in the plot, compared to Li’s method. The log-log plot reveals our time complexity is roughly linear to the size of the vocabulary in these data sets. This is about two orders lower than that for Li’s method.","There is little relevance in comparing the speed of the 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.8 0.81 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 precision coverage our method Li’s method CLASSIFY Figure 3: Coverage-precision plot CLASSIFY method to the speed of the other two methods, because its computation time does not include the time required to decide the proper number of classes. Of more interest is to see its seeming speed-up in the largest data sets. This implies that, in large and sparse training data, the CLASSIFY method was caught in some bad local optima at some early points on the way to better local optima.","Figure 2 has the computation times as a function of the coverage which is achieved using that computation time. From this, we would expect our method to reach higher coverage within a realistic time if we used larger quantities of training data. To determine this, we need other experiments using larger corpora, which we intend to do in the future.","Table 1 lists the description lengths for training data from 1 to 32k and Table 2 shows the precision and coverage achieved by each method with this data. In these tables, we can see that our method works slightly better than Li’s method as an optimization method which minimizes the description length, and also in the evaluation tasks. Therefore, we can say that our method decreased computational costs without losing accuracy. We can also see that ours always performs better than the CLASSIFY method. Both ours and the CLASSIFY method use random initializations, but from the results, it seems that our top-down, divisive strategy in combination with K-means like swapping and merging operations avoids the poor local optima where the CLASSIFY method was caught.","Figure 3 also presents the results in terms of coverage-precision trade-off. We can see that our method selected always better points in the trade-off than Li’s method or the CLASSIFY method.","From these results, we can conclude that our clustering algorithm is more efficient and yields slightly better results than Li’s method, which uses the same clustering criterion.
