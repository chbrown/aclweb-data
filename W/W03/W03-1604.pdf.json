Further, paraphrases of technical terminology are dealt with by a separate process that detects surface variants."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The problem of paraphrases conceals a number of dieren t linguistic problems, which in our opinion need to be treated in separate ways. In fact, paraphrases can happen at various levels in language. Using the examples provided in the call for papers for this workshop, we would like to attempt a simple classication, without any pretense of being exhaustive: 1. Lexical synonymy. Example: article, paper, publication 2. Morpho-syntactic variants. a) Oswald killed Kennedy. / Kennedy was killed by Oswald. b) Edison invented the light bulb. / Edison’s invention of the light bulb. while (a) is purely syntactical (active vs passive), (b) involves a nominalisation. 3. PP-attachment. a plant in Alabama / the Alabama plant 4. Comparatives vs superlatives. be better than anybody else / be the best","5. Subordinate clauses vs separate sentences linked by anaphoric pronouns. The tree healed its wounds by growing new bark. / The tree healed its wounds. It grew new bark. 6. Inference. The stapler costs $10. / The price of the stapler is $10. Where is Thimphu located? / Thimphu is capital of what country?","Of course combinations of the dieren t types are possible, e.g. Oswald killed Kennedy / Kennedy was assassinated by Oswald is a combination of (1) and (2).","Dieren t types of knowledge and dieren t linguistic resources are needed to deal with each of the above types. While type (1) can be dealt with using a resource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), type (2) needs eectiv e parsing and mapping of syntactic structures into a common deeper structure, possibly using a repository of nominalisations like NOMLEX (Meyers et al., 1998). More complex approaches are needed for the other types, up to type (6) where generic world knowledge is required, for instance to know that being a capital of a country implies being located in that country. 1","Such world knowledge could be expressed in the form of axioms, like the following:","(X costs Y) iff (the price of X is Y)","In this paper we focus on the role of paraphrases in a Question Answering (QA) system targeted at 1 Note that the reverse is not true, and therefore this","is not a perfect paraphrase. technical manuals. Technical documentation is characterised by vast amounts of domain-specic terminology, which needs to be exploited for providing in-telligent access to the information contained in the manuals (Rinaldi et al., 2002b). The approach taken by QA systems is to allow a user to ask a query (for-mulated in natural language) and have the system search a background collection of documents in order to locate an answer. The eld of Question Answering has ourished in recent years2",", in part, due to the QA track of the TREC competitions (Voorhees and Harman, 2001). These competitions evaluate systems over a common data set allowing developers to benchmark performance in relation to other competitors.","It is a common assumption that technical terminology is subject to strict controls and cannot vary within a given editing process. However this assumption proves all too often to be incorrect. Unless editors are making use of a terminology control system that forces them to use a specic version of a term, they will naturally tend to use various paraphrases to refer to the intended domain concept. Besides in a query a user could use an arbitrary paraphrases of the target term, which might happen to be one of those used in the manual itself or might happen to be a novel one.","We describe some potential solutions to this problem, taking our Question Answering system as an example. We show which benets our approach based on paraphrases bring to the system. So far two different domains have been targeted by the system. An initial application aims at answering questions about the Unix man pages (Molla et al., 2000a; Molla et al., 2000b). A more complex application targets the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) of the Airbus A320 (Rinaldi et al., 2002b). Recently we have started new work, using the Linux HOWTOs as a new target domain.","In dealing with these domains we have identied two major obstacles for a QA system, which we can summarise as follows: The Parsing Problem The Paraphrase Problem","The Parsing Problem consists in the increased dicult y of parsing text in a technical domain due to domain-specic sublanguage. Various types of multi word expressions characterise these domains, in particular referring to specic concepts like tools, parts or procedures. These multi word expressions might","2","Although early work in AI already touched upon the topic, e.g. (Woods, 1977). include lexical items which are either unknown to a generic lexicon (e.g. coax cable) or have a specic meaning unique to this domain. Abbreviations and acronyms are another common source of inconsistencies. In such cases the parser might either fail to identify the compound as a phrase and consequently fail to parse the sentence including such items. Alternatively the parser might attempt to ‘guess’ their lexical category (in the set of open class categories), leading to an exponential growth of the number of possible syntactic parses. Not only the in-ternal structure of the compound can be multi-way ambiguous, even the boundaries of the compounds might be dicult to detect and the parsers might try odd combinations of the tokens belonging to the compounds with neighbouring tokens.","The Paraphrase Problem resides in the imperfect knowledge of users of the systems, who cannot be expected to be completely familiar with the domain terminology. Even experienced users, who know very well the domain, might not remember the exact wording of a compound and use a paraphrase to refer to the underlying domain concept. Besides even in the manual itself, unless the editors have been forced to use some strict terminology control system, various paraphrases of the same compound will appear, and they need to be identied as co-referent. However, it is not enough to identify all paraphrases within the manual, novel paraphrases might be created by the users each time they query the system.","In the rest of this paper we describe rst our Question Answering System (in Section 2) and briey show how we solved the rst of the two problems described above. Then, in Section 3 we show in detail how the system is capable of coping with the Paraphrase Problem. Finally in Section 4 we discuss some related work."]},{"title":"2 A Question Answering System for Technical Domains","paragraphs":["Over the past few years our research group has developed an Answer Extraction system (ExtrAns) that works by transforming documents and queries into a semantic representation called Minimal Logical Form (MLF) (Molla et al., 2000a) and derives the answers by logical proof from the documents. A full linguistic (syntactic and semantic) analysis, complete with lexical alternations (synonyms and hyponyms) is performed. While documents are processed in an o-line stage, the query is processed on-line.","Two real world applications have so far been implemented with the same underlying technology. The original ExtrAns system (Molla et al., 2000b) is used ///// a.d electrical coax cable.n4 connects.v062 the.d external antenna.n1 to.o the.d ANT connection.n1 /////","-Wd Dsu Ss","-MVp -Os","Ds","-Js Ds RW Figure 1: An Example of LG Output to extract answers to arbitrary user queries over the Unix documentation les (\\man pages\"). A set of 500+ unedited man pages has been used for this application. An on-line demo of ExtrAns can be found at the project web page.3","Knowledge Base Document Linguistic Analysis","Term processing Figure 2: O-line Processing of Documents","More recently we tackled a dieren t domain, the Airplane Maintenance Manuals (AMM) of the Airbus A320 (Rinaldi et al., 2002b), which oered the additional challenges of an SGML-based format and a much larger size (120MB).4 Despite being developed initially for a specic domain, ExtrAns has demonstrated a high level of domain independence.","As we work on relatively small volumes of data we can aord to process (in an o-line stage) all the documents in our collection rather than just a few selected paragraphs (see Figure 2). Clearly in some situations (e.g. processing in-coming news) such an approach might not be feasible and paragraph index-ing techniques would need to be used. Our current approach is particularly tar-","geted to small and medium sized collections.","In an initial phase all multi-word expressions","from the domain are collected and structured in","an external resource, which we will refer to as the","TermBase (Rinaldi et al., 2003; Dowdall et al., 2003).","The document sentences (and user queries) are syn-","tactically processed with the Link Grammar (LG)","parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) which uses a 3 http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/cl/extrans/ 4 Still considerably smaller than the size of the docu-","ment collections used for TREC grammar with a wide coverage of English and has a robust treatment of ungrammatical sentences and unknown words. The multi-word terms from the thesaurus are identied and passed to the parser as single tokens. This prevents (futile) analysis of the in-ternal structure of terms (see Figure 1), simplifying parsing by 46%. This solves the rst of the problems that we have identied in the introduction (\\The Parsing Problem\").","In later stages of processing, a corpus-based approach (Brill and Resnik, 1994) is used to deal with ambiguities that cannot be solved with syntactic information only, in particular attachments of prepositional phrases, gerunds and innitiv e constructions. ExtrAns adopts an anaphora resolution algorithm (Molla et al., 2003) that is based on Lappin and Leass’ approach (Lappin and Leass, 1994). The original algorithm, which was applied to the syntactic structures generated by McCord’s Slot Grammar (Mc-Cord et al., 1992), has been ported to the output of Link Grammar. So far the resolution is restricted to sentence-internal pronouns but the same algorithm can be applied to sentence-external pronouns too.","A lexicon of nominalisations based on NOMLEX (Meyers et al., 1998) is used for the most important cases. The main problem here is that the semantic relationship between the base words (mostly, but not exclusively, verbs) and the derived words (mostly, but not exclusively, nouns) is not sucien tly systematic to allow a derivation lexicon to be compiled automatically. Only in relatively rare cases is the relationship as simple as with to edit <a text> $ editor of <a text> / <text> editor, as the eort that went into building resources such as NOMLEX also shows.","User queries are processed on-line and converted into MLFs (possibly expanded by synonyms) and proved by refutation over the document knowledge base (see Figure 3). Pointers to the original text at-tached to the retrieved logical forms allow the system to identify and highlight those words in the retrieved sentence that contribute most to that particular answer. When the user clicks on one of the answers provided, the corresponding document will be displayed with the relevant passages highlighted.","Knowledge Base ANSWERSQuery Document Linguistic Analysis","Paraphrase Identification Figure 3: On-line Processing of Queries","The meaning of the documents and of the queries produced by ExtrAns is expressed by means of Minimal Logical Forms (MLFs). The MLFs are designed so that they can be found for any sentence (using robust approaches to treat very complex or ungrammatical sentences), and they are optimized for NLP tasks that involve the semantic comparison of sentences, such as Answer Extraction.","The expressivity of the MLFs is minimal in the sense that the main syntactic dependencies between the words are used to express verb-argument relations, and modier and adjunct relations. However, complex quantication, tense and aspect, temporal relations, plurality, and modality are not expressed. One of the eects of this kind of underspecication is that several natural language queries, although slightly dieren t in meaning, produce the same logical form.","The main feature of the MLFs is the use of reication (the expression of abstract concepts as concrete objects) to achieve at expressions (Molla et al., 2000b). The MLFs are expressed as conjunctions of predicates with all the variables existentially bound with wide scope. For example, the MLF of the sentence \\cp will quickly copy the les\" is:","(1) holds(e4), object(cp,o1,[x1]), object(s command,o2,[x1]), evt(s copy,e4,[x1,x6]), object(s file,o3,[x6]), prop(quickly,p3,[e4]).","In other words, there is an entity x1 which represents an object of type cp and of type command, there is an entity x6 (a le), there is an entity e4, which represents a copying event where the rst argument is x1 and the second argument is x6, there is an entity p3 which states that e4 is done quickly, and the event e4, that is, the copying, holds. The entities o1, o2, o3, e4, and p3 are the result of reication. The reication of the event, e4, has been used to express that the event is done quickly. The other entities are not used in this MLF, but other more complex sentences may need to refer to the reication of properties (adjective-modifying adverbs) or object predicates (non-intersective adjectives such as the alleged suspect).","ExtrAns nds the answers to the questions by forming the MLFs of the questions and then running Prolog’s default resolution mechanism to nd those MLFs that can prove the question. When no direct proof for the user query is found, the system is capable of relaxing the proof criteria in a stepwise manner. First, hyponyms of the query terms will be added as disjunctions in the logical form of the question, thus making it more general but still logically correct. If that fails, the system will attempt approximate matching, in which the sentence (or sentences) with the highest overlap of predicates with the query is retrieved. The (partially) matching sentences are scored and the best ts are returned. In the case that this method nds too many answers because the overlap is too low, the system will attempt key-word matching, in which syntactic criteria are abandoned and only information about word classes is used. This last step corresponds approximately to a traditional passage-retrieval methodology with consideration of the POS tags."]},{"title":"3 Dealing with Paraphrases","paragraphs":["The system is capable of dealing with paraphrases at two dieren t levels. On the phrase level, dierent surface realizations (terms) which refer to the same domain concept will be mapped into a common identier (synset identier). On the sentence level, paraphrases which involve a (simple) syntactic transformation will be dealt with by mapping them into the same logical form. In this section we will describe these two approaches and discuss ways to cope with complex types of parapharases. 3.1 Identifying Terminological Paraphrases","During the construction of the MLFs, thesaurus terms are replaced by their synset identiers. This results in an implicit ‘terminological normalization’ for the domain. The benet to the QA process is an assurance that a query and answer need not involve exactly the same surface realization of a term. Utilizing the synsets in the semantic representation means that when the query includes a term, ExtrAns returns sentences that logically answer the query, in-Fastr Term Extraction Hyponymy Thesaurus ExtrAns Document Figure 4: Term Processing volving any known paraphrase of that term.","For example, the logical form of the query Where are the stowage compartments installed? is translated internally into the Horn query (2).","(2) evt(install,A,[B,C]), object(D,E,[B]), object(s stowage compartment,G,[C])","This means that a term (belonging to the same synset as stowage compartment) is involved in an in-stall event with an anonymous object. If there is an MLF from the document that can match example (2), then it is selected as a candidate answer and the sentence it originates from is shown to the user.","The process of terminological variation is well investigated (Ibekwe-SanJuan and Dubois, 2002; Daille et al., 1996; Ibekwe-Sanjuan, 1998). The primary focus has been to use linguistically based variation to expand existing term sets through corpus investigation or to produce domain representations. A subset of such variations identies terms which are strictly synonymous. ExtrAns gathers these morpho-syntactic variations into synsets. The sets are augmented with terms exhibiting three weaker synonymy relations described by Hamon & Nazarenko (2001). These synsets are organized into a hyponymy (isa) hierarchy, a small example of which can be seen in Figure 5. Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of this process.","The rst stage is to normalize any terms that contain punctuation by creating a punctuation free version and recording the fact that that the two are strictly synonymous. Further processing is involved in terms containing brackets to determine if the bracketed token is an acronym or simply optional. In the former case an acronym-free term is created and the acronym is stored as a synonym of the remain-ing tokens which contain it as a regular expression. So evac is synonymous with evacuation and ohsc is synonymous with overhead stowage compartment. In cases such as emergency (hard landings) the bracketed tokens can not be interpreted as acronyms and so are not removed.","The synonymy relations are identied using the terminology tool Fastr (Jacquemin, 2001). Every token of each term is associated with its part-of-speech, its morphological root, and its synonyms. Phrasal rules represent the manner in which tokens combine to form multi-token terms, and feature-value pairs carry the token specic information. Metarules license the relation between two terms by constrain-ing their phrase structures in conjunction with the morphological and semantic information on the individual tokens.","The metarules can identify simple paraphrases that result from morpho-syntactic variation (cargo compartment door ! doors of the cargo compartment), terms with synonymous heads (electrical cable ! electrical line), terms with synonymous modiers (fastener strip ! attachment strip) and both (functional test ! operational check ). For a description of the frequency and range of types of variation present in the AMM see Rinaldi et al. (2002a). 3.2 Identifying Syntactic Paraphrases","An important eect of using a simplied semantic-based representation such as the Minimal Logical Forms is that various types of syntactic variations are automatically captured by a common representation. This ensures that many potential paraphrases in a user query can map to the same answer into the manual.","For example the question shown in Figure 6 can be answered thanks to the combination of two factors. On the lexical level ExtrAns knows that APU is an abbreviation of Auxiliary Power Unit, while on the syntactic level the active and passive voices (supplies vs supplied with) map into the same underlying representation (the same MLF).","Another type of paraphrase which can be detected at this level is the kind that was classied as type (3) in the introduction. For example the question: Is the sensor connected to the APU ECB?, can locate the answer This sensor is connected to the Electronic Control Box (ECB) of the APU. This has been achieved by introducing meaning postulates that operate at the level of the MLFs (such as \\any predicate that aects an object will also aect the of -modiers of that object\"). 3.3 Weaker Types of Paraphrases When the thesaurus denition of terminological synonymy fails to locate an answer from the document collection, ExtrAns explores weaker types of paraphrases, where the equivalence between the two terms might not be complete. TERM","doors of the cargo compartment cargo compartment door cargo comparment doors cargo-compartment door emergency ( hard landings ) emergency hard landings emergency hard landing","emergency evacuation (evac) emergency evacuation","evacuation evac electrical cable electrical line fastner strip attachment strip functional test operational check","door functional test stowage compartment","overhead stowage compartment OHSC 1 2 3 5 6 7 10 9 8 11 Figure 5: A Sample of the TermBase Figure 6: Active vs Passive Voice","First, ExtrAns makes use of the hyponymy relations, which can be considered as sort of unidirec-tional paraphrases. Instead of looking for synset members, the query is reformulated to included hyponyms and hyperonyms of the terms:","(3) (object(s stowage compartment,A,[B]); object(s overhead stowage compartment,A,[B])), evt(install,C,[D,B]), object(E,F,[D|G])","Now the alternative objects are in a logical OR relation. This query nds the answer in Figure 7 (where stowage compartment is a hyperonym of overhead stowage compartment).","We have implemented a very simple ad-hoc algorithm to determine lexical hyponymy between terms. Term A is a hyponym of term B if (i) A has more tokens than B, (ii) all the tokens of B are present in A, and (iii) both terms have the same head. There are three provisions. First, ignore terms with dashes and brackets as cargo compartment is not a hyponym of cargo - compartment and this relation (synonymy) is already known from the normalisation process. Second, compare lemmatised versions of the terms to capture that stowage compartment is a hyperonym of overhead stowage compartments. Finally, the head of a term is the rightmost non-symbol token (i.e. a word) which can be determined from the part-of-speech tags. This hyponymy relation is comparable to the insertion variations dened by Daille et al. (1996).","The expressivity of the MLF can further be expanded through the use of meaning postulates of the type: \\If x is installed in y, then x is in y\". This ensures that the query Where are the equipment and furnishings? extracts the answer The equipment and furnishings are installed in the cockpit."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["The importance of detecting paraphrasing in Question Answering has been shown dramatically in TREC9 by the Falcon system (Harabagiu et al., 2001), which made use of an ad-hoc module capable of caching answers and detecting question similarity. As in that particular evaluation the organisers deliberately used a set of paraphrases of the same questions, such approach certainly helped in boost-ing the performance of the system. In an environ-ment where the same question (in dieren t formulations) is likely to be repeated a number of times, a module capable of detecting paraphrases can significantly improve the performance of a Question An-Figure 7: Overhead stowage compartment is a Hyponym of Stowage compartment swering system.","Another example of application of paraphrases for Question Answering is given in (Murata and Isahara, 2001), which further argues for the importance of paraphrases for other applications such Summarisa-tion, error correction and speech generation.","Our approach for the acquisition of terminological paraphrases might have some points in common with the approach described in (Terada and Tokunaga, 2001). The motivation that they bring forward for the necessity of identifying abbreviations is related to the problem that we have called \\the Parsing Problem\".","A very dieren t approach to paraphrases is taken in (Takahashi et al., 2001) where they formulate the problem as a special case of Machine Translation, where the source and target language are the same but special rules, based on dieren t parameters, license dieren t types of surface realizations.","Hamon & Nazarenko (2001) explore the terminological needs of consulting systems. This type of IR guides the user in query/keyword expansion or proposes various levels of access into the document base on the original query.
