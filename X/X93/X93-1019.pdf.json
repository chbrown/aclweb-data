POST tags each word with one of 47 possible tags with 97% accuracy for known words.

In particular, word groups that are important to the domain and that may be detectable with only local lexical information can be treated here. The concept-based pattern matcher applies finite-state patterns to the output of POST, which consists of word tokens with part-of-speech information. The patterns in addition have access to lexical semantic information, which includes a semantic type (or concept) and other semantic information. When a pattern is matched, a semantic form is assigned by the action component of the pattern to the word sequence. This assignment has two effects: the word sequence is temporarily defined in PLUM's lexicon, and the input is retokenized to treat the word sequence as a single unit for further processing. Lexical items added by the pattern actions remain active for the duration of the document's processing. In this way, subsequent sentences may recognize, for example, aliases of corporations identified in previous sentences. The patterns used by the concept-based pattern-matcher may be grouped by \"phases\", indicating multiple pattern-matching passes. Phases following the first phase operate on the input as modified by the previous phase. We have used at most two phases in our applications so far. In both joint ventures and microelectronics, patterns were used to group proper nouns into company names, organization names, and person names. Continuing with the example sentence discussed above, a pattern recognized the sequence (BRIDGESTONE NP) (SPORTS NPS) (CO. NP) as a company; the pattern's action substituted the single token (BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO. CORP), with semantics of corporation."]},{"title":"3.4 Fast Partial Parser (FPP)","paragraphs":["The FPP is a near-deterministic parser which generates one or more non-overlapping parse fragments spanning the input sentence, deferring any difficult decisions on attachment ambiguities. When cases of permanent, predictable ambiguity arise, the parser finishes the analysis of the current phrase, and begins the analysis of a new phrase. Therefore, the entities mentioned and some relations between them are processed in every sentence, whether syntactically ill-formed, complex, novel, or straightforward. Furthermore, this parsing is done using essentially domain-independent syntactic information. FPP averages about 6 fragments for sentences as complex as in the EJV corpus; this number is inflated since punctuation usually results in an isolated fragment. Continuing with the same example sentence, Figure 3-2 196 shows nine parse fragments as generated by FPP. The Japanese grammar produces smaller fragments by design."]},{"title":"3.5 Semantic Interpreter","paragraphs":["The semantic interpreter contains two sub-components: a rule-based fragment interpreter and a pattern-based sentence interpreter. The first was used in MUC-3 and MUC-4. The second subcomponent was added before MUC-5."]},{"title":"3.5.1 Rule-based Fragment Interpreter","paragraphs":["The rule-based fragment interpreter applies semantic rules to each fragment produced by FPP in a bottom-up, compositional fashion. Semantic rules are matched based on general syntactic patterns, using wildcards and similar mechanisms to provide robustness. A semantic rule creates a semantic representation of the phrase as an annotation on the syntactic parse. A semantic form includes a variable (e.g., ?13), its type, and a collection of predicates pertaining to that variable. There are three basic types of semantic forms: entities in the domain, events, and states of affairs. Each of these can be further categorized as known, unknown, and referential. Entities correspond to the people, places, things, and time intervals of the domain. These are related in various ways, such as through events (who did what to whom) and states of affairs (properties of the entities). Entity descriptions typically arise from noun phrases; events and states of affairs are often described in clauses. The rule-based fragment interpreter encodes defaults so that missing semantic information does not produce errors, but simply marks elements or relationships as unknown. Partial understanding is critical to text processing systems; missing data is normal. For example, the generic predicate PP-MODIFIER is used to indicate that two entities are connected via a certain preposition when no more specific information is known. In this way, the system has a \"placeholder\" for the information that a certain structural relation holds, even though it does not know what the actual semantic relation is. Sometimes understanding the relation more fully is of no consequence, since the information does not contribute to the template-filling task. The information is maintained, however, so that later expectation-driven processing can use it if necessary. In Figure 3-3 we show the semantic representation that is built by the rule-based semantic interpreter for the phrase \"THE JOINT VENTURE, BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWAN CO., CAPITALIZED AT 20 MILLION NEW TAIWAN DOLLARS\" in EJV walkthrough article 0592 (this phrase is parsed within a single fragment by FPP). Notice that the JOINT-VENTURE is linked to the OWNERSHIP information via an unknown role, because the interpreter was unable to determine a specific relationship between the NP \"THE JOINT VENTURE, BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWAN CO.,\" and the participial modifier \"CAPITALIZED AT ...\" The discourse component will further refine the relationship between these two semantic objects to the JV-OWNERSHIP-OF relation."]},{"title":"FI:","paragraphs":["\"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO.

Unlike the fragment-combination module used in MUC-4, the rules used in this module need not be tailored to expected fragmentation by the parser. The rules may simply look for parsed phrases with certain semantic characteristics, ignoring whether such a phrase is alone in a fragment or is a part of a larger fragment. For example, in the English joint-venture domain, we have defined a rule which looks for possibly multiple instances of [<PERCENTAGE> \"by\" <ENTITY>]. This rule's action creates an OWNERSHIP semantic form, where <ENTITY> is related via the OWNERSHIP-ENTITY role and <PERCENTAGE> via the OWNERSHIP-% role. In the walkthrough, this rule matches in the sentence \"THE NEW COMPANY ..... IS OWNED 75 PCT BY BRIDGESTONE SPORTS, 15 PCT BY UNION PRECISION ...\". and has much less coverage. Lexical semantic entries indicate the word's semantic type (a domain model concept), as well as predicates pertaining to it. For example, here is the lexical semantics for the noun collocation \"joint venture\".","(defnoun \"joint venture\"","(JOINT-VENTURE (:CASE ((\"with\" \"between\") ENTITY PARENT-OF)","(\"for\" ACTIVITY ACTIVITY-OF)))) This entry indicates that the semantic type is JOINT-VENTURE, and that a \"with\" or \"between\" PP argument whose type is ENTITY should be given the role PARENT-OF, and a \"for\" PP argument of type ACTIVITY should be given the role ACTIVITY-OF.

When references are resolved, corresponding semantic variables are unified. Other inferences may also be added to the database. For each sentence, the discourse component processes each semantic form produced by the interpreter, adding its information to the predicate database and performing reference resolution for pronouns and anaphoric definite NPs. Set- and member-type references may be treated. When a semantic form for an event of interest is encountered, an initial DDO is generated, and any slots already found by the interpreter are filled in. The discourse processor then tries to merge the new DDO with a previous DDO, in order to account for the possibility that the new DDO might be a repeated reference to an earlier one. This merging of discourse domain objects is itself a form of reference resolution. To check compatibility of objects before allowing merging to take place, this procedure uses the same tests used for reference resolution. In addition, other parameters are also used which may, for example, limit the distance allowed between objects considered for merging. Once all the sentences have been processed through DDO creation and merging, heuristic rules are applied to fill any empty DDO slots by looking at the text surrounding the forms that triggered a given DDO. Each slot filler found in the text is assigned a confidence score based on distance from its trigger. Fillers found nearby are of high confidence, while those farther away receive worse scores. Low numbers represent high confidence; high numbers low confidence; thus 0 is the \"highest\" confidence score, used mainly for fillers obtained from predicates asserted in the semantic representation.

The template generator uses a combination of data-driven and expectation-driven strategies. First the DDOs found by the discourse module are used to produce template objects. Next, the slots in those objects are filled using information in the DDO, the discourse predicate database, or other sources of information such as the message header (e.g., document number, document source, and date information), statistical models of slot filling (e.g., as in the microelectronics domain to choose among the slots: purchaser/user, developer, distributor, and manufacturer), or from heuristics (e.g., the status of an equipment object is most likely to be IN_USE, or the status of a joint venture object is most likely to be EXISTING)."]},{"title":"3.8 Parameters in PLUM","paragraphs":["Many aspects of PLUM's behavior can be controlled by simply varying the values of system parameters.

ORIGINAL PROJECT/SYSTEM GOALS Our original goal was to apply a new, unproven approach to the text understanding problem.

EVOLUTION OF SYSTEM OVER 2","YEARS We began our research agenda approximately three years ago. During the past two years, we have focused much of our effort on techniques to facilitate porting our data extraction system (PLUM) to new languages (Japanese) and to two new domains (joint ventures and microelectronics). We have also concentrated on infrastructure development, including the addition of the two pattern matching components as well as an object-oriented template generator. First, consider the evolution in the runtime version of PLUM, as illustrated in Figure 3-1 can be summarized as follows: Message reader -- Prior to this contract, the message reader was code that had to be modified for each application domain. The change was to make the code domain independent and language independent, driven by a declarative knowledge base which is modifiable for the peculiarities of a given class of text.","• Concept-based pattern matcher -- This is a new module, which processes finite state grammars of expressions that can be reliably recognized upfront. It covers organization names, person names, and other items which could be defined in the context-free grammar, but which are so simple in structure that a finite state grammar is sufficient.","• Semantic interpreter -- Coverage of the semantic interpreter was extended in two ways - The number of domain-independent rules was increased greatly, particularly for English - A phrase-based pattern matcher replaced a \"fragment combining\" component to robustly capture the semantics of phrases that are not parsed in a single fragment.","• Discourse - Discourse processing was improved and generalized to more accurately determine whether two text descriptions actually discussed the same thing or same event.","• Template generator -- A new template generation component was written to separate domain-independent code from domain-dependent details, to support output of object-oriented data.","Several new algorithms were added to automate the porting","process, rather than being part of the runtime version of","PLUM. These included:","• A component to automatically learn to classify text (paragraphs) as relevant or irrelevant, given examples of both types of text.","• A simple technique for rapidly defining jargon words.","• A technique for hypothesizing semantically related words from relatively small volumes of text, e.g., from as few as 1,000 articles. 6. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 6.1 Dealing With Multiple Languages And Multiple Domains Any system that participated in more than one domain in MUC-5 and/or in more than one language has demonstrated domain independence and language independence. In PLUM, the text zoner, morphological processing, parsing, and semantic interpretation employ language-independent and domain-independent algorithms driven by data (knowledge) bases. Similarly, the discourse algorithms and template generation algorithms are domain- and language-independent, and are driven by knowledge that is predominantly declarative. The issue (or the goal)that all systems must address further is greater automation of the porting process. Our approach has been to rely on probabilistic learning 200 algorithms. Here we focus on some surprises in dealing with multiple languages and multiple domains. 6.1.1 Dealing With Multiple Domains Porting PLUM to a new domain, even in multiple languages, takes much less effort as a result of the last two years of work. Table 1 shows the labor expended in porting PLUM to the microelectronics domain. In 52 person-days, PLUM was processing microelectronics articles in both English and Japanese, obtaining reasonable performance. Had we run PLUM at that time on the TIPS3 test sets, scores would already have been impressive in English (an ERR of 74). For Japanese, performance was 73 on test set TIPS2. (We quote the score for TIPS2, because it covered only the capabilities for which there was data at the time of the TIPS2 version of PLUM.) When the proposal for this effort was submitted, we made a conservative assumption that all probability models would need to be re-estimated for each domain. During this effort, it became clear that, though one could re-estimate probabilities for each domain, that it was not necessary. Performance of the overall data extraction system could be adequate without domain-specific training. In fact, in moving to microelectronics, no domain-specific linguistic training was used; however, the performance in microelectronics was quite close to that in joint ventures, where domain-specific training was used. See Figure 7-1 Tasks Person-Davs","Language-independent 14 English 19 Japanese 1.__9 TOTAL 52 Table 6-1: Effort to Port to Microelectronics Porting the PLUM system to a new domain involves developing the domain-dependent knowledge bases, primarily the domain model, event rules, and application constraints of Figure 1. To the degree that jargon is used in the domain, the lexicon and patterns will be updated. We have generally proceeded by first building a text-to-response system with small domain coverage. In our experience, this base system can be built in about a week. Once this base system exists, development of knowledge bases can proceed in parallel. In order to build the basic text-to-response system, the following tasks must be performed (not necessarily sequentially).","• The format description for the input texts must be specified; this enables the system to digest the text that is to be processed.","• The domain model (concepts and roles) is defined. The domain model can be defined based on the output template specification. • An initial lexicon of important words is created. Here,","we utilize a tool that assists the domain developer in","classifying words (collected from a text corpus and","sorted by frequency) into a small number of semantic","classes. This tool allows the domain developer to","quickly create a lexicon with semantic type","information. The lexicon is subsequently reviewed by","hand, and case frame information is added. • An initial set of event rules is defined. • The output template objects are defined.","Optionally, the POST part-of-speech tagger may be","retrained on the new corpus. Note that we did not retrain","POST in porting to the microelectronics domain, as we","found the frequency models that were derived from","domain-independent training were adequate. It is also helpful to identify a key set of example sentences that the system should cover. These sentences can be used to drive initial development, as well as to track progress. Once these tasks have been completed, it should be possible to process a text in the new domain and get some limited amount of output. The key to this achievement is the default reasoning that is part of the PLUM system. For example, default semantic, discourse, and template filling rules will be utilized where no domain-specific information is available. After the initial system is created, the knowledge bases can be refined in parallel to achieve greater coverage. Analysis tools, such as a scoring program, can be used to identify and focus on areas in need of development. 6.1.2 Porting to Multiple Languages Annotating data for PLUM's probabilistic model of a new language, even with little language-specific resources, proved easier than anticipated. The only resource available to us at the start was the JUMAN system from Kyoto University, which hypothesizes word segmentation and part of speech for Japanese text. Our Japanese speakers were able to annotate part of speech and word boundaries at about 1,000 words per hour, and were able to annotate syntactic structure at about 750 words per hour. Initial annotation and testing were performed using only 16,000 words plus the JUMAN lexicon; therefore, the initial port to Japanese required only about a person-week of annotation effort. One algorithm change was made in the port to Japanese. The change was not required; the algorithms are language independent; however, by introducing an existing Japanese algorithm much labor was saved in processing Japanese text, where neither spaces nor any other delimiters mark the beginning and end of words. We had at our disposal the following: - A rule-based Japanese morphological processor (JUMAN) from Kyoto University. 201","A context-free grammar of Japanese based on part of speech labels distinct from those produced by JUMAN. - A probabilistic part-of-speech tagger (POST) [Meteer, et al., 1991] which assumed a single sequence of words as input. - Limited human resources for creating training data. The architecture in Figure 6-1 was chosen to minimize labor and to maximize use of existing software. It employs JUMAN first to provide initial word segmentation of the text, an annotation-based algorithm second to correct both segmentation errors and part of speech errors in JUMAN output, and POST third both to select among ambiguous alternative segmentations/part-of-speech assignments and also to predict the part of speech of unknown words."]},{"title":"Japanese Text i A","paragraphs":["I JUMAN ["]},{"title":"] AM~ED I~ Segment Correction Model POST I ~ Part-of-speech I Model Word segments with Part of Speech Figure 6-1.

Building lexical resources for a new language or a new domain took only a few person days using heuristics. In Japanese, a three step process for hypothesizing proper names reduced the labor involved. First, we ran JUMAN + POST over the training corpus to find the sequence of words and their most likely part of speech in context. Then, a finite-state process with a handful of language-specific patterns was run on the result to hypothesize (previously unknown) proper nouns in the corpus. The patterns were designed for high recall of names, at the expense of low precision; we measured the effectiveness of the technique as 90% recall at 20% precision. Lastly, a person ran through the hypothesized proper names using KWIC as a resource to quickly eliminate bad hypotheses. The resulting list of names was made available to all the participants in JJV. A simple manual technique also enabled fast semantic categorization of the nouns and verbs of each domain in both languages. Using a KWIC index and the frequency of each noun and each verb in the corpus, we could define about 125 words per hour, placing each word into categories such as HUMAN, CORPORATION, OFFICER, GOVERNMENT-ORGANIZATION, etc. The process could go so quickly by organizing the categories into small menus of at most 12 items, so that a person need only make simple discriminations in any pass through a list of words."]},{"title":"6.2 Demonstration Prototype","paragraphs":["Since data extraction from text is a new capability, the value of demonstration prototypes became clear, not only as a medium to communicate what the capability offers potential users and also as a trigger to ignite thoughts of how the technology could become a usable aid to users. We developed a single, MOTIF-based, graphical user interface to both domains (joint ventures and microelectronics) and both languages, (English and Japanese), for a total of 4 applications English joint ventures, Japanese joint ventures, English microelectronics, and Japanese microelectronics. The demonstration emphasized the perspective of a potential user of the data extraction technology. A message was selected and processed by the PLUM system, and the output was displayed in the form of a table summarizing the information extracted by the system. In the amount of time that it would take a user to quickly read through an article, the PLUM system can process it and present its results. The user can then browse through the specific template objects and make any changes or corrections that are necessary. The system also serves as an aide for the analyst's correction task. PLUM graphically displays its confidence in particular pieces of information in the output so the analyst can choose to focus on verifying information that PLUM is not highly confident in. Furthermore, by clicking on a piece of information in the template, the analyst can see where in the text the information came from. Figure 6-2 shows the contents of the screen after the user has clicked on the slot fill \"a company in Japan\": the fragment containing the phrase which gave rise to the filler, \"the Japanese group\", is highlighted in the text. When editing template fill values, the analyst can mark and copy text in the article. The system automatically \"normalizes\" the new value. For example, the analyst might add or correct a company's location by highlighting a string in the text. The system then normalizes the text into the gazetteer-style format required by the domain. The system also displays alternate values that it had considered but rejected for some reason. Figure 6-3 shows the pop-up window which presents the user with the entities that were 202 considered for a slot. The boxes to the left of each entity description are used as \"push-buttons\": a raised button indicates the entity is not selected for the slot (as in the first entry, \"A company in Japan\", which the user had corrected). By providing this type of support, the analyst can concentrate more on what information should be in the template, not what the particular format of the template fills needs to be. 6.3 Results in Probabilistic/Learning Algorithms 6.3.1 Morphology Our POST part-of-speech tagger (Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel 1991) uses a stochastic bi-gram model to assign syntactic categories to words in unrestricted text, even if they are unknown. BBN was the first to successfully use several new techniques in part-of-speech analysis: In addition to its use in several PLUM applications, POST has now been distributed to over ten research and development sites. In the last two years, it was modified to deal with ambiguous cases of word boundaries. Also, a more optimal version was written, achieving speedup by a factor of 80. 6.3.2 Acquiring Word Association Information BBN has recently developed a technique for semi-automatically learning word and word group associations [Matsukawa, 1993]. Unlike some other approaches based on mutual information between words, this technique estimates the likely association between groups of words, a kind of conceptual clustering. These word groups can either be automatically generated by a hill-climbing algorithm, or produced by manual classification (in the case of nouns, a simple and rapid classification at the rate of 500 words per hour proved to be adequate). By using words grouped into concept classes, even low-frequency data can be considered. 6.3.3 Automatic Error Correction The traditional approach to word segmentation and part-of-speech labelling in Japanese is the use of rule-based morphological analyzers employing a hand-crafted lexicon and a hand-crafted connectivity matrix. BBN's AMED module [Matsukawa, Miller, and Weischedel, 1993] is an example-based correction technique for segmentation and part-of-speech labelling, which uses annotated text as supervised training. AMED is able to cover cases that occur infrequently by generalizing during training. Using AMED together with POST improved the accuracy of part-of-speech labelling without requiring revision to the existing morphological analyzer (JUMAN). 6.3.4 First Application of Statistical Text Classifier to","Data Extraction from Text For MUC-4, we demonstrated the first technique for significantly varying the trade-off between recall and precision (Weischedel et al, 1992). This used an automatically-trained text classifier that predicted whether paragraphs of text were relevant to the data extraction task, based on a probabilistic model using words as features. This gives the user the capability of tuning system performance to favor either recall or precision, by varying the threshold on the classifier. 203"]},{"title":"Select Message !Analyze[[Find Entities [Options [QuitJ Pertamina would make a decision on the matter possibly in early November.

Our team faced training new staff two months before the MUC-5 test, as our single Japanese programmer needed to reduce his involvement substantially. Starting at the beginning of June, two Japanese computer science majors, who had just completed their junior year at college came to BBN. They had no training in computational linguistics, but had one course in artificial intelligence and one in LISP. In June, they learned about data extraction, the joint venture and microelectronics tasks, and how to use PLUM. Since the Japanese articles on packaging and lithography had arrived much later than the other data, and since we had not touched that data, they focussed on those two capabilities starting July 1. Initially, of course, PLUM had near 100 as an ERR on sets composed primarily of those microelectronics capabilities. As evident in Figure 7-5, the progress was rapid and dramatic, as the error rate dropped by 25% in all cases and by almost 50% in some cases. One consequence in the change of personnel was that performance in both Japanese domains had not peaked. Also, very little effort was devoted to Japanese joint ventures. Many slotw received no effort, accounting for the relatively low recall in JJV."]},{"title":"7.2 Discussion of Metrics","paragraphs":["In the last few months before the final evaluation, we noticed an anomaly in the official measure ERR. We noticed that some changes to the runtime version of PLUM could reduce ERR (\"error rate\") by 2 points (e.g., by 5%), even though the actual number of errors made by the system increased. The anomaly arises because ERR is computed as","# missed data + # incorrect answers + # spurious answers # system answers Therefore, it is theoretically possible to generate more questionable output, producing just enough correct output to reduce ERR, even though more than 50% of the additional output is spurious. 100 75 70 65 60 55","50 July July July July July July July"]},{"title":".2 9 14 16 19 23 28","paragraphs":["Figure 7-5.

Rather, min-err/max-err are better for cross-system comparison, since they normalize the number of errors by a system-independent measure, the number of answers in the answer key. Min-err/max-err are defined as","# missed data + # incorrect answers + # spurious answers # answers in answer key Since some answers are optional, min-err and max-err differ in whether the optional answers are counted in the denominator. If one uses this unofficial, system-independent measure, systems perform quite differently in at least some cases. Since we tuned PLUM, trying to jointly optimize both ERR and min-err, PLUM's performance for both English domains was outstanding on both measures.","8. CONCLUSIONS Some of the lessons we learned during our work in TIPSTER include the following:","• Automatic training and acquisition of knowledge bases can yield relatively good performance at reduced labor, as evidenced, for example, by a quick port to the microelectronics domain (in 2 languages) in 2 person-months (after which further refinements were made). For the TIPS3 test, our total effort spent on each of the 4 domains (in person-months) was as follows: FEJV 4.5, EME 3, JJV 2, JME 3.","• Domains dominated by jargon (sub-language) may be easier than domains of normal vocabulary because there is less ambiguity and more predictability. For TIPSTER this means that the microelectronics domain was easier than joint ventures.","• Japanese was easier to process than English because of strong clues provided by case-markers, and a less varied linguistic structure in the articles.","• Availability of a large text corpus was invaluable for quick knowledge acquisition. Less filled templates should still be adequate.","• Our algorithms are already largely language- and domain-independent; an important goal remains to further automate the porting process.","• Finite-state pattern matching is a useful complement to linguistic processing, offering a good fall-back strategy for addressing language constructions that are hard to treat via general linguistically-based approaches.","• Continued work on discourse processing is important to improving performance. Reliably determining when different descriptions of events or objects in fact refer to the same thing remains one of the hardest problems in data extraction. • Improving syntactic coverage is a priority. Increased","coverage normally leads to greater perceived","ambiguity in the system; we hope to counter this","through the use of probabilistic models. We plan to continue our research agenda emphasizing the use of probabilistic modeling and learning algorithms for data extraction in order to continue improving robustness and portability.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work reported here was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and was monitored by the Rome Air Development Center under Contract No. F30602-91-C-0051.
