Interim evaluations were conducted in September, 1992, and February, 1993; the final evaluation was conducted in July, 1993. The final evaluation included not only the Tipster-supported inform~on extraction contractors but thirteen other participants as well. This evaluation was the topic of the Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5) in August, 1993. With particular respect to the research and development tasks of the Tipster contractors, the goal of these evaluations has been to assess success in terms of the development of systems to work in both English and Japanese (BBN, GE/CMU, and NMSU/Brandeis) and/or in both the joint ventures and microelectronics domains (BBN, GE/CMU, NMSU/Brandeis, and UMass/Hughes).","The methodology associated with these evaluations has been under development since 1987, when the series of Message Understanding Conferences began. The evaluations have pushed technology to handle the recurring language problems found in sizeable samples of naturallyoccuring text. Designing the evaluations around an information extraction application of text processing technology has made it possible to discuss NLP techniques at a practical level and to gain insight into the capabilities of complex systems.","However, any such evaluation testbed application will undoubtedly differ in important respects from a real-life application. Thus, there is only an indirect connection between the evaluation results for a system and the suitability of applying the system to performance of a task in an operational setting. A fairly large number of metrics have been defined that respond to the variety of subtasks inherent in information extraction and the varying perspectives of evaluation consumers.","The evaluations measure coverage, accuracy, and classes of error on each language-domain pair, independently of all other language-domain pairs that the system may be tested on. With its dual language and domain requirements and challenging task definition, Tipster Phase 1 pushed especially hard on issues such as portability tools, language-and domain- independent architectures and algorithms, and system efficiency. These aspects of software were not directly evaluated, although information concerning some or all of them may be found in the papers prepared by the evaluation participants,"]},{"title":"THE EVALUATION PROCESS","paragraphs":["The Tipster contractors were allowed access to the training corpus (articles and hand-coded templates for a given language-domain pair) and associated materials (documentation, software resources, lexical resources) as they were being prepared over the course of Phase 1.

For the 12-month test, the evaluation software that had been used for MUC-4 was rewritten by SAIC to accomodate the object-oriented Tipster templates. Issues that were addressed in the interim between the 12-month and the 18-month tests include JV template formating (especially in the Japanese template), performance metrics (probabifity of false alarm as alternative to precision, system-independent version of recall), object alignment by the evaluation software 8 (content-based as well as threshold-based alignment options, alignment optimization based on score rather than on number correc0, and evaluation software support for human performance studies (scoring of one set of hand-coded templates versus another).","At the 18-month meeting, decisions were made regarding scoring for the 24-month/MUC-59 evaluation. The principal decision was to supplant recall and precision with a modified formulation of the error rate metric that had been in experimental usage for the 18-month test. The revised metric was named error per response fill because it is system-dependent (i.e., the denominator in the formula varies across systems according to the number of spurious fills generated, and it also varies because the answer keys allow for a somewhat variable number of expected fills). Error per response fill 8Object alignment as implemented for MUC-5 is discussed in the next section. 9Since the MUC-5 evaluation was the 24-month evaluation for the Tipster contractors, the evaluation will hereafter be referred to simply as the MUC-5 evaluation. became the primary measure of performance. However, a less system-dependent error rate metric was also implemented; this metric was termed the richness-normalized error. These changes to the metrics necessitated significant reprogramming of the evaluation software. In addition, the decision was made to convert portions of the JV template from objects to complex slots 10, and this resulted in significant updates to the evaluation software, JV corpora, and JV documentation. Another decision resulting from this meeting was to ease the object alignment criteria, largely because of the difficulty of setting valid threshold values given the sparseness of the fills in many of the objects in the answer key.","The MUC-5 dry run was conducted after all these updates h~ been completed. Between the dry run and the final test two months later, further updates were made to the evaluation software, including a revised way of scoring two-part (complex) slots in the JV template. The new method gives separate scores to each part of the two-part fill, rather than giving one score to the complex fill as a whole. Another update was the implementation of a limited two-pass object alignment strategy, which results in slightly improved object alignments because more of the information on the interrelationships among entities is present when objects that reference the entities are aligned.","The intention had been to eliminate some evaluation criteria before the MUC-5 effort began in earnest in March, 1993; however, some of the decisions made at the 18-month meeting were tentative and, in the end, few simplifications were made at that time. The net result was that the number of performance measures has increased since MUC-4, and it is clear that there is still no clear answer as to the single most appropriate criterion to apply to assessing performance on an information extraction task. The good news is that the error per response fill and the F-measure provide consistent views of the relative performance of systems, and therefore technology consumers may choose to use whichever set of metrics they feel is most appropriate for their purposes. All this experimentation resulted in other useful information as well about system-independent metrics, object alignment approaches, and template design, among other things. l OThis conversion affected three parts of the JV"]},{"title":"template: ownership percent, product/service,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"activity site.","paragraphs":["After the conversion, each of these was represented in the template as a two-part slot rather than as an object with two slots. 150 Alignment and Scoring System-generated"]},{"title":"(response)","paragraphs":["templates must be aligned with the answer-key"]},{"title":"(key)","paragraphs":["templates for scoring.

Slot-fill alignments that the alignment program can only guess at may be revised inter'actively during the scoring stage.","Alignment at the object level is the most compficated and controversial aspect of alignment. It takes place prior to scoring, and it is normally done fully automatically because to do it interactively would be so time-consuming as to be virtually impossible. The criteria for estabfishing whether an object ought to be allowed to align at all are defined in a file external to the alignment process. The criteria are defined to apply across all instances of a given object type. However, it is difficult to specify the criteria in this manner since many instances in the keys contain little fill on which to base a comparison.","Various object alignment schemes and minimal alignment criteria (also called the"]},{"title":"minimal mapping requirements)","paragraphs":["have been tried; for MUC-5, an alignment scheme called"]},{"title":"threshold-based was","paragraphs":["used, and the alignment criteria were loose.

Such slots are ignored in the alignment process.","If there is no content match at all between a response object and a key object or if the only match is on a slot that is excluded from the threshold-based alignment criteria, the response object is marked as spurious.

Such objects are aligned on the basis of the degree of slot-fill match, as coarsely determined by the alignment program. The program determines an approximate error per response fill score, which will be overridden during the actual scoring process following alignment.","The alignment of objects in one pass results in suboptimal mappings of some object types, especially <entity> in the JV template, because advantage cannot be taken of useful information about the dependency between <entity> (or <person>) and <entity-relationship>. The solution implemented for MUC-5 was to align objects in two passes, with a few of the object types handled in both passes. However, despite the theoretical advantages of two-pass alignment, it is believed that the adopted solution results in only slightly improved object mappings over what can be done in a single pass. Two-pass alignment is only a partial solution to the problem, but the problem itself appears to be relatively minor. MEASURING TASK DIFFICULTY","With each new MUC, the evaluators have challenged technology to deal with a broader variety of texts and to do more with them. One of the ways in which MUC-5 distinguishes itself from previous evaluations is in the increased task realism, which manifests itself in a greater variety of data extraction requirements, in the requirement for translation of extracted information into entries from standard reference sources (unabridged gazetteers, the Standard Industrial Code manual, etc.), and in a richer template structure. However, the most distinctive feature of Tipster Phase 1 for extraction is the requirement to handle more than one language and more than one domain. This requirement generated a strong push in the direction of language- and domain-independence, while the task realism 151 generated a strong push for maximizing task coverage with minimum time and effort.","Major changes have been made to the evaluation design over the years, which complicates the issue of progress assessment. Not only have the metrics and scoring and alignment algorithms evolved and been replaced, but new exlraction tasks have been defined [10]. The first two tasks were in the naval tactical domain, the next two were in the terrorist domain, and the Tipster/MUC-5 evaluation was conducted in the joint ventures and mieroelectronics domains. One could conceive of trying to compare the difficulty of these tasks in terms of human performance; however, at this point there exists reasonably sound performance data only for MUC-5 [11]. One could also imagine trying to measure relative difficulty in some atheoretic or polytheoretic way in terms of the number of semantic patterns, inference rules, etc., required to carry out the task, but that idea is not a practical one.","In a preliminary attempt to compare the difficulty of different extraction tasks, quantitative criteria were developed in support of MUC-3 that enable comparison in terms of superficial features of the texts, template definition, and template fill rules [5]. Comparison of the complexity of the terrorist task with the naval task in light of these criteria shows at least an order-of-magnitude increase for several of the criteria. Once allowances are made for changes to the scoring methods and the earlier evaluation results are recomputed, it is clear for the results of the top systems in each evaluation that MUC-3 system performance represents significant progress for extraction systems as a group over the previous evaluation.","The criteria can be adapted to allow rough estimation of the relative difficulty of the MUC-5 joint ventures and microelectronics tasks compared to the MUC-3/MUC-4 terrorism task. Most of the adaptations reflect the shift from a flat-format template to an object-oriented template.

To that end, only the top-scoring systems are included in the comparison, namely those that were in one of the top two ranks statistically according to the F-measure. 14","There were four systems in the top two ranks for MUC-4 (TST3 and TST4 test sets) [2] and three in the top two ranks for MUC-5 (EJV test set) [3]. These systems are GE, GE/CMU, UMass/Hughes, and SRI for MUC-4, and GE/CMU, BBN, and SRI for FEJV MUC-5. The average F-measure score of the MUC-4 systems is 51.68; the average for the MUC-5 EJV systems is 47.12. If the one non-Tipster EJV system (SRI) is excluded from the EJV MUC-5 average, the average rises to 49.35.","The greater level of difficulty of the MUC-5 EJV task and the fact that the F-measure scores are close to being as high as the MUC-4 F-measure scores indicate that performance of top MUC-5 EJV systems is at least comparable to performance of top MUC4 systems. It is important to remember that the Tipster systems were achieving that level of performance for MUC-5 on EJV while working also in the microelectronics domain and, in most cases, also in Japanese. In that regard, it is notable that 14The \"P&R\" F-measure value is used. This value weights precision and recall equally. the GE/CMU system scored in the top rank in each language and domain pair; on the F-measure their scores were 52.75 for EJV, 60.07 for JJV, 49.18 for EME, and 56.31 for JME. It is also notable that SRI, which was a non-Tipster MUC-5 participant in both EJV and JJV, achieved F-measure scores of 42.67 and 44.21, respectively.","The fact that relative task difficulty can be assessed only roughly together with the fact that several MUC-5 sites worked on more than one task mean that too much importance should not be placed on comparison of scores between MUC-4 and MUC-5. However, whether or not difficulty factors and evaluation design changes are taken into account, there is at least one MUC-5 task on which performance can only be said to be outstanding, namely the JJV core-template task. Two systems achieved an F-measure score on the JJV core-template test in the 70-80 range -- 73.54 (corresponding to error per response fill of 39) for the GE/CMU Shogun system and 77.94 (error per response fill of 34) for the GE/CMU optional test run with the TEXTRACT system. Top performance on the EJV core-template test was about 20 points worse. The relatively high performance on the JJV core-template task may be indicative not only of the relative simplicity of the core-template task compared to the full-template task but also to the relative simplicity of the JJV texts compared to the EIV texts. (Some of these language differences are discussed further in a later section.) Nonetheless, taken on the task's own terms, these JJV scores reflect strong performance."]},{"title":"Comparison of Machine Performance with Human Performance Application perspective.","paragraphs":["The F-measure is a weighted combination of recall and precision.

As reported in [11], human performance and machine performance on 120 articles in the MUC-5 EME test set was measured.

Performance of the top systems fell far below human performance; the three systems used in the comparison were able to extract up to 53% of the information expected, and of all the information they extracted, at best 57% of it was judged to be correct. In terms of performance shortfall, the machines fell 19-38 points of human performance on the recall measure and 18-31 points short of human performance on the precision measure.","Increasing system recall and precision by another 20 points or so may not seem to be a difficult task -- after all, since systems managed to obtain an F-measure score in the 70s on the JJV core-template test, why not also on the EME task? But it may not be easy to increase both recall and precision by that amount simultaneously on a relatively difficult task such as FAME, since the metrics are in tension with each other. The harder a system tries to extract all the expected information (i.e., the more aggressively configured it is), the more likely it is to extract erroneous information. The tension is reduced if the texts are easier to interpret, as the JJV texts apparently are (see section below on handling two languages) and if the task is simpler, as the JJV core-template task undoubtedly is in comparison to the EME (full-template) task.","The overall recall and precision scores hide the fact that there were not only slots on which human performance was relatively strong but also slots on which human performance was relatively weak. A study reported in [11] measured the degree of difference between human and machine performance for frequently-filled slots in a portion of the EME test set. The author's general conclusion was that machines did comparatively well on slots that may lend themselves to keyword analysis and that are to be filled with a set-fill category from a relatively long list; examples include the <layering> type and film slots.","Speed. Another respect in which systems showed an advantage over humans is in terms of speed. On average, the time required for a human to fill a template (using software tools tailored for the Tipster tasks) was between 15 minutes (for an EME template) to over 60 minutes (for a JJV template). In contrast, timing information collected for the BBN PLUM system, the GE/CMU Shogun system, and the NMSU/Brandeis Diderot system shows that the average time required to process an article in the EME test set was between 75.0 seconds (Shogun on a Sparcl0 with 64 mb RAM) and 211.2 secon6s (Diderot, which was not optimized for speed in English, on a Spare2 with 32 mb RAM) and that the average time required to process an article in the JJV test set was between 39.0 seconds (Diderot on a Sparc2 with 2.32 mb RAM) and 140.8 seconds (PLUM on a Sparcl0 with 128 mb RAM). Predominant Classes of Error","The most frequent type of error committed by nearly all of the MUC-5 systems was to miss pertinent information. This class of error is captured by the undergenemtion metric. The test results show that performance on this metric is a good indicator of performance on the overall metric of error per response fill. The effect of undergenemtion in relation to the overgenerafion and substitution metrics as well as to the error per response fill metric can be seen in figures 1 and 2, which graph the results of all MUC-5 systems for I10 l0 7O I0 so 4o 30 2O lO 0 BBN GE/CMU LSl ~ ~ UVASS/t.ltJ","Figure 1.

Classes of error and overall error per response fill for all JME MUC-5 systems 155 the EME and JME tests. From these graphs it is clear that undergeneration (UND) generally correlates with the overall metric of error per response fill (ERR), overgeneration (OVG) does not correlate with it, and substitution (SUB) correlates with it only to a limited extent.","Substitution is a lesser source of error than undergeneration and overgeneration, lesser even than overgenerafion. Examination of the template-fill specifications sheds light on these data. Some slots and objects in the JV and ME templates have essentially fixed number, requiting one fill or allowing zero or one fill; others have a highly variable number, some requiring one or more fills and some allowing zero or more fills. Thus, for the slots having a highly variable number of fills, there is no absolute bound on the number of fills a system could potentially spuriously generate. This means that overgeneration on those slots could be quite high. Substitution errors, on the other hand, are accrued only when there exists a pairing between a fill in the key and a fill in the response, and the response is judged to be incorrect. Thus, the substitution score has as its upper bound the number of fills in the key.","If the extraction of relatively little target information is indicative of poor overall performance, how and to what extent does the extraction of relatively much information -- good or bad -- correlate with overall performance? Are the aggressive systems just wildly guessing, or is their aggressiveness paying off form them on the overall metric? The data show that there is a correlation between generating lots of data and obtaining a relatively good (i.e., low) error per response fill score. This can be seen by computing the number of fight and wrong fills generated by a system (this number is called the actual (ACT)) as a percentage of the total number of fills expected (termed the possible (POS)) and comparing that percentage with the overall error per response f'dl score.","In figure 3, the EME results are sorted by increasing error per response fill on the vertical axis. It is evident that the more fills generated by the system, the better its error per response fill score, even to the extent that the number of fills generated by the GE/CMU system exceeds the number expected, i.e., the system clearly generated a high proportion of spurious fills (as figure 1 bears ou0. The only clear exception to the generalization is the UMichigan system, which had a relatively high error per response fill score despite having generated relatively many fillers (more than the Language Systems, Inc. (LSI) system or NMSU/Brandeis system). Figure 1 shows that the UMichigan system suffered from relatively high overgeneration as well as relatively high undergeneration.

Welltrained humans are being compared with the best-performing MUC-5 systems. Since the MUC evaluations are designed to challenge research technology as well as to show a practical use of technology, it would probably be unreasonable to expect that any information extraction system participating in a MUC evaluation would perform at a level close to humans, and it is unlikely that any of the MUC-5 participants had comparability with humans as their primary development goal. Nonetheless, there may be evaluation data to help support speculation about how likely it would be that these systems could be developed to make up the shortfall.","Figure 1 shows that all EME systems other than GE/CMU incurred more errors as a result of missing information than as a result of committing other types of error, and figure 3 shows that generating more data was generally beneficial in terms of improving overall performance. The fact that the BBN and UManitoba systems' overall performance is very close to GE/CMU's -- in fact, the differences among the three are statistically insignificant [3] -- provides evidence that relatively good performance does not necessarily come at the expense of high overgeneration 15 and therefore that 15This is not to fault the GE/CMU system for overgenerafing. There are other systems with an equal or worse overgeneration score that come nowhere near matching the GE/CMU system in error per response fill. The GE/CMU system had undergeneration and ! 120 156 greater task coverage could make up for some of the shortfall from human performance. Further evidence of the room left for improvement of most, if not all, MUC-5 systems is found in the fact that there are slots which systems never filled in during the final test. 16 Even in the case of Tipster systems, these unattempted slots can account for a sizeable proportion of the total number of missed pieces of information, t7"]},{"title":"Measuring the Performance of Systems at Different Levels of Maturity Scoring of","paragraphs":["unfilled slots. An object that is instantiated in the answer key may not be fully filled; the corresponding text may not provide information to fill some of the slots defined for that object type.

Noncommittals are not included in the standard formulation of any of the performance measures. This is reasonable from a research perspective, if not from an applications perspective.

Of the four language-pair systems they were required to field for MUC-5, three came out slightly better on balance on recall (which emphasizes minimizing undergeneration) and one, JJV, came out slightly better on precision (which emphasizes minimizing overgeneration). 16Count of unattempted slots (i.e., those where the system's \"actual\" equals zero) excludes those slots that were never filled in the key (i.e., those where the \"possible\" equals zero). 17For example, BBN's JJV system made no attempt to fill 17 of the slots in the JJV template, which accounts for 25% of the total missing, and their JME system made no attempt to fill 12 of the JME slots, accounting for 24% of the total missing; the UMass/Hughes system made no attempt to fill 13 of the EYV slots and 11 of the EME slots, and in each case this accounts for 15% of the total missing.","The effect of scoring noncommittal fills as correct fills is to give an inflated estimate of performance, at least for the systems that undergenerate to a relatively large extent. It also has the potential effect of giving a distorted cross-system view, since very imlmature systems could end up being ranked higher than is intuitively sensible. 18","The latter effect was not evident, however, for MUC-5, despite the relatively large number of unfilled slots in the answer keys (FJV compared to MUC-4). Apparently, the potential effect on the MUC-5 evaluation was eliminated through the object structure. Since the MUC-5 templates consist of objects that arc aligned separately, the scoring impact of producing an object that fails to meet the minimal alignment criteria is limited to just that one object. Such an object, which contains an insufficient amount of correct fill to warrant alignment, is not given credit for any \"correct\" fills. 19 Thus, even though the object alignment criteria were loose for MUC-5, there were still objects that failed to align, and systems got no credit for any correct inftrmation that they may have contained.","For MUC-4, on the other hand, there was no object alignment, only template alignment, and the template alignment criteria were fairly strict. Thus, although no credit would be gained for correct fills in an unaligned template, the amount of credit that would be obtained for noncommittal fills in an aligned template would be fairly high on average, since the MUC-4 template is a larger structure than any of the objects in the MUC-5 template.","Figures 4 and 5 provide examples of the difference the treatment of the noncommittal scoring category can make in the MUC-5 results. They 18When applied to MUC-4 systems, the standard formulation of error per response fill results in no significant reranking of the 17 systems. But a formulation that includes noncommittals would result in rerankings of all 17 systems. The most radical changes would be for immature systems whose number of noncommittals grealy outweighs all other categories of response. 19Major differences between MUC-5 and MUC-4 in the alignment process do not play a role in this investigation of the scoring of noncommittal fills, since the investigation with respect to both MUC-5 and MUC-4 treated such fills as correct only in the scoring stage, not in the alignment stage. As far as scoring method goes, the two evaluations are not very different; both used the All-Objects method, which for MUC-4 was called All-Templates. 157 show the error per response fill scores for the Tipster systems on EME and JME MUC-5 using two formulations of the metric: the standard formulation, which disregards noncommittal fills, and the alternative formulation, which treats noncommittal fills as correct.

This distribution reflects the fact that the core-template slots cover some of the less idiosyncratic portions of the task. Since the MUCJ test set is fairly representative of data seen in the training corpus, it is not surprising that participants would have dedicated more development effort to the core slots in the template and would have been able to leverage previous work that is applicable across a range of tasks.

The third exception is that the UMasdHughes system performed four points worse on <entity>aliases, a core string-fill slot, than on <person>name, which is a non-core string-fill slot.

These are both pointer slots to an <entity> object. For each system, there is at least one non-core pointer slot (and as many as five) that the system scored better on than on than these two core slots. Furthermore, there is a gap between the scores for these two core pointer slots and the scores for the other core pointer slots of at least nine points (and as many as seventeen). The joint-venture and entity2 slots have similarities that indicate why performance on them is not as good as on the other core pointer slots: they both require making two-way role distinctions among entities found in the texts, and they both capture the less frequent of the two entity roles. In the case of the <tie-up-relationship> object, both the joint-venture and the entity slots point to an <entity> object, but the joint-venture is meant to be filled only when a tie-up results in the formation of a joint venture company, which is often not the case. In the case of the <entity-relationship> object, both the entityl and entity2 slots point to an <entity> object, but the entity2 slot is meant to be filled only if a relationship exists other than partnership, which is the most common type of relationship. The lower scores on joint-venture and entity2 are therefore attributed in part to the relative difficulty of identifying specific roles of entities. The restricted use of the joint-venture and entity2 slots is reflected in the template definition: joint-venture and entity2 are constrained to contain either zero or one filler while the entity and entityl slots must contain at least one filler and may contain two or more. The system must decide not only what to fill the joint-venture and entity2","paragraphs":["slots with but also whether to fill them at all. Thus, the system is likely to fill them only if it has found clear evidence in order to avoid generating spurious data, and this can result in the opposing type of performance problem, namely missing relevant information.","Apart from the joint-venture and entity2 slots, the only core slots that appear to have suffered relatively poor performance for all four systems compared to other core slots are the <entity> location and <entity>nationality slots, two of the three geographic place-name slots in the template. Although the systems scored better on these two place-name slots than on the non-core one, <facility>location, the fact that all systems appeared to have relative difficulty with those two core slots is notable, as it may reflect a practical difficulty of selecting the correct entry for an ambiguous place name from the large English gazetteer as well as the linguistic difficulty of determining whether a mention of a place in association with an entity reflects the entity's location or its nationality.","However, there is a problem with attributing relatively low performance of the four core slots under discussion solely to the difficulty of determining the correct role of an entity or of a geographic place-name. The problem is that the lower performance may also be partially explained by the fact that those slots are less frequently filled than any of the other core slots in the full-template test. 25 All other core slots account for at least 3% each of the fills in the full-template test, with six core slots in the 3--4% range and five slots in the 5-10% range. Thus, even among the core slots, it can be expected that development efforts were not focused equally on all slots and that lower performance on some core slots may be a consequence not only of their relative difficulty but also of their lesser impact on the tolal evaluation. SUMMARY","The evaluations conducted during Phase 1 of the Tipster extraction program have measured the completeness and accuracy of systems and have used an examination of the role of missing, spurious and 25However, these four core slots are more frequently filled than many of the non-core slots. Of the 30 non-core slots, 24 account for less than 3% each of the total fills (13 account for less than 1% each, and 11 account for 1-2% each); only six of the non-core slots account for a sizeable proportion of the total fills (four account for 3-4% each, and only two account for 5-10% each). otherwise erroneous output as a means of diagnosing the state of the art. Viewed as a set of performance benchmarks for the state of the art in information extraction, the MUC-5 evaluation yielded EJV results that are at least as good as the MUC-4 level of performance. This comparison takes into account some of the measurable differences in difficulty between the EJV task and the MUC-3 and MUC-4 terrorism task.","However, even a superficial comparison of task difficulty is hard to make because of the change from the fiat-format design of the earlier MUC templates to the object-oriented design of the MUC-5 templates. Comparison is also made difficult by the many changes that have been made to the alignment and scoring processes and to the performance metrics. Therefore, it is more useful to view performance of the MUC-5 systems on their own terms rather than in comparison to previous MUC evaluations.","From this independent vantage point, MUC-5 yielded very impressive results for some systems on some tasks. Error per response fill scores as low as 34 (GE/CMU optional test run using the CMU TEXTRACT system) and 39 (GE/CMU Shogun system) were obtained on the JJV core-template test. The only other error per response fill scores in the 30-40 range were achieved by humans, who were tested on the EME task; however, machine performance on that EME test was only half as good as human performance. Thus, while the JJV core-template test results show that machine performance on a constrained test can be quite high, the EME results show that a similar level of machine performance on a more extensive task could not be achieved, at least not in the relatively short development period allowed for ME.","Not only do results such as those cited for the JJV core-template test show how well some approaches to information extraction work for some tasks, they also show how manageable languages other than English can be. A cross-language comparison of results showed fairly consistent advantage in favor of Japanese over English. Comparison of results across domains does not show an advantage in favor of one domain over the other, and it is quite likely that differences in the nature of the texts, the nature and evolution of the extraction tasks, and the amount of time allowed for development all had an impact on the results.","The quantity and variety of material on which systems were trained and tested presented challenges far beyond those posed by earlier MUC evaluations. 162 The scope of the evaluations was broad enough to cause most MUC-5 sites to skip parts of the extraction task, especially types of information that appear relatively rarely in the corpus. Since no type of information is weighted in the scoring more heavily than any other, the biases that exist in the evaluation reflect the distribution of relevant information in the text corpus and result in a natural emphasis on handling the most frequently-occurring slot-tilting tasks. These tasks turn out to be the ones that are less idiosyncratic and therefore more important to the development of generally useful technology.","Examination of the slot-level results in the appendix to this volume shows which systems are filling which slots and how aggressively they are generating fills. For those slots where a system is generating a substantial number of fills, analysis at the level of the individual templates and corresponding texts would provide insight into the particular circumstances under which the system extracted corr~ or incorrect information. In other words, the quantitative performance measures may yield information on aspects of performance that deserve further analysis, but a deeper investigation needs to include examination of the actual fills and the actual texts. The discussion in this paper of slot-level performance on the JV core-template task does not go as far as that; the discussion is based only on frequency of slot fill and on the slot definitions. Some of the deeper analysis can be carried out only by the authors of the systems. Such an analysis would relate the circumstances under which correct or incorrect system behavior was seen with the strengths and weaknessses of particular algorithms and modules of the system."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["The author would like to acknowledge the extensive support throughout Tipster Phase 1 from Nancy Chinchor and Gary Dungca at SAIC.
