This paper looks briefly at the history of these Conferences and then examines the considerations which led to the structure of MUC-6. 2","1 Portions of this article are taken from the paper \"Message Understanding Conference-6: A Brief History\", in COLING-96, Proc. of the Int'l Conf. on Computational Linguistics.","2 The full proceedings of the conference are to be distributed by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, California; earlier MUC proceedings, for MUC-3, 4, and 5, are also available","The Message Understanding Conferences were initiated by NOSC to assess and to foster research on the automated analysis of military messages containing textual information. Although called \"conferences\", the distinguishing characteristic of the MUCs are not the conferences themselves, but the evaluations to which participants must submit in order to be permitted to attend the conference. For each MUC, participating groups have been given sample messages and instructions on the type of information to be extracted, and have developed a system to process such messages. Then, shortly before the conference, participants are given a set of test messages to be run through their system (without making any changes to the system); the output of each participant's system is then evaluated against a manually-prepared answer key.","The MUCs have helped to define a program of research and development. DARPA has a number of information science and technology programs which are driven in large part by regular evaluations. The MUCs are notable, however, in that they have substantially shaped the research program in information extraction and brought it to its current state. 3 from Morgan Kaufmann.","3There were, however, a number of individual research efforts in information extraction underway before the first MUC, including the work on information formatting of medical narrative by Sager at New York University [3]; the formatting of naval equipment failure reports at the Naval Research Laboratory [1]; and the DBG work by Montgomery for RADC (now"]},{"title":"413 PRIOR MUCS","paragraphs":["MUC-1 (1987) was basically exploratory; each group designed its own format for recording the information in the document, and there was no formal evaluation. By MUC-2 (1989), the task had crystalized as one of template filling. One receives a description of a class of events to be identified in the text; for each of these events one must fill a template with information about the event. The template has slots for information about the event, such as the type of event, the agent, the time and place, the effect, etc. For MUC-2, the template had 10 slots. Both MUC-1 and MUC-2 involved sanitized forms of military messages about naval sightings and engagements.","The second MUC also worked out the details of the primary evaluation measures, recall and precision.

A sample MUC-3 message and template is shown in Figure 1. This same task was used for MUC-4 (1992), with a further small increase in template complexity (24 slots). For MUC-1 through 4, all the text was in upper case.","MUC-5 (1993), which was conducted as part of the Tipster program, represented a substantial further jump in task complexity. Two tasks were involved, international joint ventures and electronic circuit fabrication, in two languages, English and Japanese. In place of a single template, the joint venture task employed 11 object types with a total of 47 slots for the output -- double the number of slots defined for MUC-4 -- and the task documentation also doubled in size to over 40 pages in length. A sample article and corresponding template for the MUC-5 English joint venture task are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The text shown is all upper case, but (for the first time) the test materials contained mixed-case text as well.","One innovation of MUC-5 was the use of a nested structure of objects. In earlier MUCs, each event had been represented as a single template - in effect, Rome Labs) [2]. a single record in a data base, with a large number of attributes. This format proved awkward when an event had several participants (e.g., several victims of a terrorist attack) and one wanted to record a set of facts about each participant. This sort of information could be much more easily recorded in the hierarchical structure introduced for MUC-5, in which there was a single object for an event, which pointed to a list of objects, one for each participant in the event.","The sample template in Figure 3 illustrates several of the other features which added to the complexity of the MUC-5 task. The TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP object points to the ACTIVITY object, which in turn points to the INDUSTRY object, which describes what the joint venture actually did. Within the INDUSTRY object, the PRODUCT/SERVICE slot has to list not just the specific product or service of the joint venture, but also a two-digit code for this product or service, based on the top-level classification of the Standard Industrial Classification. The TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP also pointed to an OWN-ERSHIP object, which specified the total capitaliza-tion using standard codes for different currencies, and the percentage ownership of the various participants in the joint venture (which may involve some calculation, as in the example shown here). While each individual feature of the template structure adds to the value of the extracted information, the net effect was a substantial investment by each participant in implementing the many details of the task."]},{"title":"MUC-6: INITIAL GOALS","paragraphs":["DARPA convened a meeting of Tipster participants and government representatives in December 1993 to define goals and tasks for MUC-6. 4 Among the goals which were identified were","• demonstrating domain-independent component technologies of information extraction which would be immediately useful","• encouraging work to make information extraction systems more portable * encouraging work on \"deeper understanding\" Each of these can been seen in part as a reaction to the trends in the prior MUCs.

In keeping with the hierarchical object structure introduced in MUC-5, it was envisioned that the mini-MUC would have an event-level object pointing to objects representing the participants in the event (people, organizations, products, etc.), mediated perhaps by a \"relational\" level object.","To further increase portability, a proposal was made to standardize the lowest-level objects (for people, organizations, etc.), since these basic classes are involved in a wide variety of actions. In this way, MUC participants could develop code for these low-level objects once, and then use them with many different types of events. These low-level objects were named \"template elements\".","As the specification finally developed, the template element for organizations had six slots, for the maximal organization name, any aliases, the type, a descriptive noun phrase, the locale (most specific loca-tion), and country. Slots are filled only if information is explicitly given in the text (or, in the case of the country, can be inferred from an explicit locale).

Like the named entity task, this was also seen as a potential demonstration of the ability of systems to perform a useful, relatively domain independent task with near-term extraction technology (although it was recognized as being more difficult than named entity, since it required merg-ing information from several places in the text).

Therefore, the committee, with strong encouragement from DARPA, included three MUC tasks which were intended to measure aspects of the internal processing of an information extraction or language understanding system. These three tasks, which were collectively called SemEval (\"Semantic Evaluation\") were:","• Coreference: the system would have to mark coreferential noun phrases (the initial specification envisioned marking set-subset, part-whole, and other relations, in addition to identity relations)","• Word sense disambiguation: for each open class word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) in the text, the system would have to determine its sense using the Wordnet classification (its"]},{"title":"\"synset\",","paragraphs":["in Wordnet terminology)","• Predlcate-argument structure: the system would have to create a tree interrelating the constituents of the sentence, using some set of grammatical functional relations The committee recognized that, in selecting such internal measures, it was making some presumptions"]},{"title":"418","paragraphs":["regarding the structures and decisions which an analyzer should make in understanding a document.

However, from the current perspective of most of the committee, these seemed fairly basic aspects of understanding, and so an experiment in evaluating them (and encouraging improvement in them) would be worthwhile."]},{"title":"PREPARATION PROCESS Round 1: Resolution of","paragraphs":["SemEval The committee had proposed a very ambitious program of evaluations. We now had to reduce these proposals to detailed specifications. The first step was to do some manual text annotation for the four tasks -- named entity and the SemEval triad -- which were quite different from what had been tried before. Brief specifications were prepared for each task, and in the spring of 1994 a group of volunteers (mostly veterans of earlier MUCs) annotated a short newspaper article using each set of specifications.","Problems arose with each of the SemEval tasks.","• For coreference, there were problems identifying part-whole and set-subset relations, and distinguishing the two (a proposal to tag more general coreference relations had been dropped earlier); a decision was later made to limit ourselves to identity relations.","• For sense tagging, the annotators found that in some cases Wordnet made very fine distinctions and that making these distinctions consistently in tagging was very difficult.","• For predicate-argument structure, practically every new construct beyond simple clauses and noun phrases raised new issues which had to be collectively resolved.","Beyond these individual problems, it was felt that the menu was simply too ambitious, and that we would do better by concentrating on one element of the SemEval triad for MUC-6; at a meeting held in June 1994, a decision was made to go with coreference. In part, this reflected a feeling that the problems with the coreference specification were the most amenable to solution. It also reflected a conviction that coreference identification had been, and would remain, critical to success in information extraction, and so it was important to encourage advances in coreference. In contrast, most extraction systems did not build full predicate-argument structures, and word-sense disambiguation played a relatively small role in extraction (particularly since extraction systems operated in a narrow domain).","The coreference task, like the named entity task, was annotated using SGML notation. A COREF tag has an ID attribute which identifies the tagged noun phrase or pronoun. It may also have an attribute of the form REF=n, which indicates that this phrase is coreferential with the phrase with ID n. Figure 5 shows an excerpt from an article, annotated for coreference. 5"]},{"title":"Round","paragraphs":["2: annotation The next step was the preparation of a substantial training corpus for the two novel tasks which remained (named entity and coreferenee). For annotation purposes, we wanted to use texts which could be redistributed to other sites with minimal encumbrances. We therefore selected Wall Street Journal texts from 1987, 1988, and 1989 which had already been distributed as part of the \"ACL/DCI\" CD-ROM and which were available at nominal cost from the Linguistic Data Consortium.","SRA Corporation kindly provided tools which aided in the annotation process. Again a stalwart group of volunteer annotators was assembled; 6 each was provided with 25 articles from the Wall Street Journal. There was some overlap between the articles assigned, so that we could measure the consistency of annotation between sites. This annotation was done in the winter of 1994-95.","A major role of the annotation process was to identify and resolve problems with the task specifications. For named entities, this was relatively straightforward. For coreference, it proved remarkably difficult to formulate guidelines which were reasonably precise and consistent. 7","5The TYPE and MIN attributes which appear in the actual annotation have been omitted here for the sake of readability.","6The annotation groups were from BBN, Brandeis Univ., the Univ. of Durham, Lockheed-Martin, New Mexico State Univ., NRaD, New York Univ., PRC, the Univ. of Pennsylvania, SAIC (San Diego), SRA, SRI, the Univ. of Sheffield, Southern Methodist Univ., and Unisys.","7As experienced computational linguists, we probably should have known better than to think this was an easy task."]},{"title":"419","paragraphs":["Maybe <COREF ID=\"136\" REF=\"I34\">he</COREF>'Ii even leave something from <COREF ID=\"138\" REF=\"i39\"><COREF ID=\"137 '' REF=\"i36\">his</COREF> office</COREF> for <COREF ID=\"i40\" REF=\"91\">Mr. Dooner</COREF>.

Round 3: dry run Once the task specifications seemed reasonably stable, NRaD organized a \"dry run\" - a full-scale rehearsal for MUC-6, but with all results reported anonymously. The dry run took place in April 1995, with a scenario involving labor union contract negotiations, and texts which were again drawn from the 1987-89 Wall Street Journal. Of the sites which were involved in the annotation process, ten participated in the dry run. Results of the dry run were reported at the Tipster Phase II 12-month meeting in May 1995.","An algorithm developed by the MITRE Corporation for MUC-6 was implemented by SAIC and used for scoring the coreference task [4]. The algorithm compares the equivalence classes defined by the coreference links in the manually-generated answer key (the \"key\") and in the system-generated output (the \"response\"). The equivalence classes are the models of the identity equivalence coreference relation. Us-ing a simple counting scheme, the algorithm obtains recall and precision scores by determining the minimal perturbations required to align the equivalence classes in the key and response."]},{"title":"THE FORMAL EVALUATION","paragraphs":["A call for participation in the MUC-6 formal evaluation was issued in June 1995; the formal evaluation was held in September 1995. The scenario definition was distributed at the beginning of September; the test data was distributed four weeks later, with results due by the end of the week. The scenario involved changes in corporate executive management personnel.","The texts used for the formal evaluation were drawn from the 1993 and 1994 Wall Street Journal, and were provided through the Linguistic Data Consortium. This data had been much less exposed than the earlier Wall Street Journal data, and so was deemed suitable for the evaluation (participants were required to promise not to look at Wall Street Journal data from this period during the evaluation). There had originally been consideration given to using a more varied test corpus, drawn from several news sources. It was decided, however, that multipie sources, with different formats and text mark-up, would be yet another complication for the participants at a time when they were already dealing with multiple tasks.","There were evaluations for four tasks: named entity, coreference, template element, and scenario template. There were 16 participants; 15 participated in the named entity task, 7 in coreference, 11 in template element, and 9 in scenario template. The participants, and the tasks they participated in, are listed in Figure 6.","The results of the MUC-6 evaluations are described in detail in a companion paper in this volume, \"Overview of Results of the MUC-6 Evaluation\". Overall, the evaluation met many, though not all, of the goals which had been set by the initial planning conference in December of 1993.","The named entity task exceeded our expectation in producing systems which could perform a relatively simple task at levels good enough for immediate use. The nearly half the sites had recall and precision over 90%; the highest-scoring system had a recall of 96% and a precision of 97%.","The template element task was harder and the scores correspondingly lower than for named entity (ranging across most systems from 65 to 75% in recall, and from 75% to 85% in precision). There seemed general agreement, however, that having prepared code for template elements in advance did make it easier to port a system to a new scenario in a few weeks. The goal for scenario templates -- mini-MUC -- was to demonstrate that effective information extraction systems could be created in a few weeks. Although it is difficult to meaningfully compare results on different scenarios, the scores obtained by most systems after a few weeks (40% to 50% recall, 60% to 70% precision) were comparable to the best scores obtained in prior MUCs.","Pushing improvements in the underlying technology was one of the goals of SemEval and its current"]},{"title":"420","paragraphs":["Task site named entity coreference template element scenario template BBN Systems and Technology • • • Univ. of Durham (UK) • • • • Knight-Ridder Information Lockheed-Martin • • • Univ. of Manitoba • • • • Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst • • • • MITRE • • New Mexico State Univ., Las Cruces New York Univ. • • • • Univ. of Pennsylvania SAIC Univ. of Sheffield (UK) • • • • SRA • • , SKI • • • • Sterling Software • .
