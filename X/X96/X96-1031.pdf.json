This approach, embodied in a system called MatchPlus, allows the user to retrieve information on the basis of meaning and context of a fi'ee text query. The MatchPlus system uses a neural network based, constrained sel~organization technique to learn word stem interrelationships directly 3~om a training corpus, thereby eliminating the need for hand crafted linguistic knowledge bases and their often substantial maintenance requirements. This paper presents results fi'om recent enhancements to the basic MatchPlus concept. These enhancements include the development of a one step learning law that greatly reduces the amount of time and~or computational resources required to train the system, and the development of a prototype multilingual (English and Spanish) text retrieval system."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["While the current MatchPlus learning law has proven to be effective in encoding relationships between words, it is computationally intensive and requires multiple passes through the training corpus. The purpose of the one step learning law is to approximate the behavior of the original learning law while performing only a single pass through the training corpus. The one step learning law uses a single pass through the training corpus to obtain desired dot product values for the set of trained context vectors. The desired dot product values are determined on the basis of information theoretic statistical relationships between co-occurring word stems found in the training corpus. Desired dot products are found such that words that tend to co-occur will have context vectors that point in similar directions while words that do not co-occur will have context vectors that tend to be orthogonal. These desired dot products are used to perform a quasi-linear transformation on an initial set of quasi-orthogonal, high dimensional vectors. This vector transformation and subsequent renormalization results in a set of context vectors that represents the relationships between word stems in a near-optimal fashion. The time requirements for training this set of vectors scale as O(Nn) where N is the number of word stems in the vocabulary and n is the average number of word stems found to co-occur (and/or be related to) any given word stem (usually on the order of several hundred). This new learning law reduces the training time by a factor on the order of 100 over the original context vector learning law with little or no degradation in performance. Results can be improved even further by adjusting the dimension of the context vectors.","HNC has also developed an approach to learning stem-level relationships across multiple languages and has used this approach to develop a prototype multilingual retrieval system. This technique, called \"symmetric learning\", is based upon the use of tie words, which provide connectivity between each language's portion of the context vector space. In the symmetric approach, learning is conducted using both languages simultaneously, thus removing any donor language biases. Tie words are used to connect the context vector space for multiple languages through a \"unified hash table\". The unified hash table provides the mechanism to translate a stem into an associated context vector. In the English-only MatchPlus system, this is a straight forward process. The stem in question is fed to the hashing function and the index is produced. The resulting index is the offset in the stem hash table. The content of that location in the hash table is a pointer to the context vector data structure. Using this approach (hash fimction collisions not withstanding), each unique stem results in a unique entry and thus a unique context vector. In the multilingual system, a tie word list is used to provide multiple references, one word stem ffi'om each language, for common context vectors. Context vector learning is performed in multiple languages"]},{"title":"149","paragraphs":["simultaneously using multilingual training corpora. HNC has performed preliminary evaluation of an English-Spanish version of this system by examining stem trees for tie words and non-tie words. Results indicate that the English-Spanish MatchPlus prototype is able to learn reasonable word stem interrelationships for tie words and non-tie words, thereby demonstrating the suitability of this concept for further development."]},{"title":"2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","paragraphs":["The HNC MatchPlus system was developed as part of the ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER text program. MatchPlus uses an information representation scheme called context vectors to encode similarity of usage. Other vector space approaches to text retrieval exist, but none embody the ability to learn word-level relationships [1-5]. Key attributes of the context vector approach are as follows: During this effort, the initially proposed context vector approach using human defined coordinates and initial conditions was extended and refmed to allow fully automatic generation of context vectors for text symbols (stems) based upon their demonstrated context of usage in training text. The MatchPlus system learns relationships at the stem level and then uses those relationships to construct a context vector representation for sets of symbols. For the text case, these sets of symbols are paragraphs, documents and queries.","To start the learning process, each stem is associated with a random vector in the context vector space. Random unit vectors in high dimensional floating point spaces have a property that is referred to a \"quasi-orthogonality\"[6]. That is, the expected value of the dot product between any pair of random context vectors selected fi'om the set is approximately equal to zero (i.e. all vectors are approximately perpendicular to one another). This property of quasi-orthogonality is important because it serves as the initial condition for the context vector learning algorithm. The usage of the context vector technique is predicated upon the rule that symbols (stems) that are used in a similar context (exhibit proximate co-occurrence behavior) will have trained vectors that point in similar directions. Conversely, stems that never appear in a similar context will have context vectors that are approximately orthogonal.","To achieve the desired representation, the context vector learning algorithm must take the context vectors for symbols that co-occur and move them toward each other. Symbols that do not co-occur are left in their quasi-orthogonal original condition. It is a basic tenet of the MatchPlus approach that \"words that are used in a similar context convey similar meaning\". Since the learning is driven by proximate co-occurrence of words, the learning results in a vector set where closeness in the space is equivalent to closeness in subject content. To perform learning, a learning window is used to identify local context. The window is \"slid\" through each document in the corpus. The window has 1 target stem and multiple neighbor stems. Once the context window has been determined, the learning rule of \"Move context vector for target in the direction of the context vector of the neighbors\" is applied. Once the correction is made, we move the learning window to next location and the learning operation is repeated. The equation for this learning is shown in Figure 1. J where: TJ ¢~ = Context vector of target i after update ~old = Context vector of target i before update 7 = Adjustment step size N# = Context vector for neighborj of target i a~j = Desired context vector dot product for target i and neighborj Figure 1. MatchPlus Learning Equations Several points should be noted:","• All stem vectors are of length 1 (unit vectors). In this paradigm, only the direction of the vector carries information.","• Fully trained vectors have the property that words that are used in a similar context will have vectors that point in similar directions as measured by the dot product.","• Words that are never used in a similar context will retain their initial condition of quasi-orthogonality. That is, approximately orthogonal with a dot product of approximately zero.","• Trained context vectors result in a concept space where similarity of direction corresponds to similarity of meaning.","• No human knowledge is required for training to occur. Only flee text examples are needed. 150 * The algorithm determines the coordinate space of","the context vectors.","When the training is complete, \"words that are used in a similar context will have their associated vectors point in similar directions\". Conversely, words that are never used in a similar context will have vectors that are approximately orthogonal.","At the summary level, the MatchPlus system translates flee text into a mathematical representation in a meaningful way. Note that the MatchPlus approach does not use any external dictionaries, thesauri or knowledge bases to determine word vector relationships. These relationships are learned automatically using only the text examples provided for learning. The result of the learning procedure is a vocabulary of stem context vectors that can be used for a variety of applications including document retrieval [7], routing [8], document clustering and other text processing tasks.","Once the stem learning is complete, it is possible to \"query\" the vector set to determine the nature of the learned relationships. To perform this operation, the user selects a \"root\" word and the trained context vector for that word is determined by a table lookup in the context vector vocabulary. MatchPlus computes the dot product of every other word vector in the vocabulary to the selected word. The resulting dot products are sorted by magnitude where larger means closer in usage.","Sets of words (text passages and queries) and documents can also be represented by context vectors in the same information space. Document context vectors are derived as the inverse document frequency-weighted sum of the context vectors associated with words in the document. Document context vectors are normalized to prevent long documents from being favored over short documents. The resulting document context vectors have the property that documents that discuss similar themes will have context vectors that point in similar directions. It is this property that translates the problem of assessment of similarity of content for text into a geometry problem. Documents that are similar are close in the space and dissimilar documents are far away. Additionally, it should be noted that all document vectors are unit length. This prevents system biases in retrieval due to document length."]},{"title":"3. ONE STEP CONTEXT VECTOR LEARNING","paragraphs":["The sections below describe an approach to context vector learning that greatly reduces the amount of computer time and resources required to obtain a trained set of stem context vectors. This approach uses a single pass through the training corpus (or corpora) to obtain desired dot product values for the set of trained context vectors. These desired dot products are used in a single pass through the vocabulary of word stems to expand a starting set of quasi-orthogonal, high dimensional vectors. This vector expansion and subsequent renormalization results in a set of context vectors that represents the relationships between words stems in a near-optimal fashion. The time requirements for training this set of vectors scale as O(Nn) where N is the number of word stems in the vocabulary and n is the average number of word stems found to co-occur (and/or be related to) any given word stem (usually on the order of several hundred). Using a near-worst case estimate of n = 1000 word stems, a vocabulary size of 50,000 words, and assuming that at least ten iterations of the original learning law are required for convergence (more often at least one hundred iterations are required), this new learning law reduces the training time by a factor of between 10 and 500 (depending on whether or not the non co-occurring terms are explicitly considered in the current learning law)."]},{"title":"3.1 Current MatchPlus Context Vector Learning Law","paragraphs":["The current MatchPlus context vector learning law is presented in Figure 1 and discussed in Section 2.

Learning Law Vector Magnitude Constraints The factors at, b are the desired dot products for the trained set of context vectors. These desired dot products are found as a function of co-occurrence statistics for word stems i and j. In most cases the number of words for which aj.j is non-zero (i.e. the co-occurring words) is several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the vocabulary. In theory, the summation on the right hand side extends over all word stems in the vocabulary. In practice, however, this summation is performed only over words that co-occur with the target word stem i. Since n=number of co-occurring words is usually much less than N=number of vocabulary word stems, summing only over co-occurring words represents a considerable time savings. Non co-occurring word stem context vectors are adjusted by subtracting the mean context vector at the end of each update iteration. This has the effect of spreading out the context vectors, hopefully driving the context vectors of non co-occurring words closer to orthogonality. With this approximation, the time requirements for the current learning law scale as O(kNn) where k is the number of iterations required for convergence."]},{"title":"3.2 Approach to One Step Learning","paragraphs":["The objective of any learning law used to train context vectors is to minimize the cost function specified in Figure 2 subject to the constraints in Figure 3.

The value of this approximate solution is that it provides adequate performance with only a fraction of the computational requirements. This one step learning law scales as O(Nn), so that it is faster than the current learning law by a factor of k (number of original learning law iterations) and is faster than the theoretically derived learning law by a factor of kN/n. For reasonable values of k, N, and n, this translated into a time savings of a factor of 10 to 1000."]},{"title":"3.3 Summary of One Step Learning","paragraphs":["The successful development and testing of the one step learning law offers the possibility of much faster context vector training.

APPROACH TO MULTILINGUAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (MIR)","paragraphs":["The objective of solving the MIR problem is to provide the analyst/user with a flexible high performance tool to allow retrieval of relevant information from multilingual corpora without the need for prior translation of large volumes of text.","The key issue is prior translation of the foreign language material. Clearly, if all material was translated to a uniform representation, say English, the problem is solved. However, translation is time consuming, costly and subjective. Additionally, the current volumes of information would overwhelm any organization who attempted to perform bulk translation. Machine translation efforts have been partially successful, but these techniques frequently ignore subtleties in the translation process. Additionally, the cost of development, tuning and validation of this approach is a hindrance to widespread use.","HNC has developed an approach to the MIR problem that leverages the context vector technology. It is called symmetric learning and its attributes, as well as the implications of its attributes, are discussed in the section below. Explanations of the approach will be given from the frame of reference of two simultaneous languages. However, it should be noted that these approaches are extensible to many languages being processed simultaneously. These discussions assume that language 1 is English and language 2 is Spanish. It should also be noted that HNC has implemented a minimal subset of the symmetric approach as a proof of concept. The preliminary results are extremely encouraging. A description of this system, the training corpus and the preliminary results are provided in Section 5."]},{"title":"4.1 Symmetric Learning","paragraphs":["HNC has developed an approach to learning stem-level relationships across multiple languages.

What is proposed is to use the tie word list to provide references for common context vectors. An example is shown in Figure 5. Assume that \"attack\" and \"ataque\" have been chosen as a tie word pair. Since these words should have the same context vector, some form of connection must be made between the words. Figure 5 shows 4 words in the unified hash table: \"rebel\", \"attack\", \"ataque\", and \"contra\". Without hash table unification based upon the tie word list, all four words would have unique and independent context vectors. However, as can be seen in the figure, the hash table entries for the tie words have been forced to point to a common context vector entry.

The basic approach described here is extensible and capable of processing more than two languages at once. Additionally, this approach can be utilized for ideographic languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean.","The key benefit of the MatchPlus context vector approach is its ability to learn the relationships between words. To simply disregard the relationships contained in the foreign data simply does not make sense. The Symmetric Learning approach exploits the learned relationships without the need to translate the foreign text. The Symmetric Learning approach requires only the translation of a limited number of words (tie words). Furthermore, this operation need only be done once.","The benefits of a multilingual approach to text processing extend well beyond text retrieval. Obviously, text routing and index term assignment could benefit from multilingual technology. Language learning tools could exploit the technology to analyze the relationships between word usage's across languages.

Because the preliminary results are so positive, HNC proposes to extend the preliminary demonstration system to Spanish in two steps. The first step for Spanish will be to develop all the required support files and software for the Spanish language including stop lists, stemmers, etc. This will result in a full capability MatchPlus system for Spanish. The second step will be to continue development of an English-Spanish MatchPlus system by augmenting the current tie-word list and to perform a series of engineering experiments. These experiments will identify the sensitivity of system performance to the characteristics of the tie-words chosen. 158"]}]}
