Different processes, such as tagging or parsing, can be applied to documents or collections and the results compared and analysed. System modules, or combinations of modules which form complete systems, e.g. IE, IR or MT systems, can be configured and evaluated (e.g. using the Parseval tools), then reconfigured and reevaluated, providing a kind of edit/compile/test cycle for LE components.","GATE comprises three principal elements:","• the GATE Document Manager (GDM) -- a TIPSTER-compatible database for storing information about texts;","• the GATE Graphical Interface (GGI) -- an in-terface for launching processing tools on data and viewing and evaluating the results;","• a Collection of Reusable Objects for Language Engineering (CREOLE) -- a collection of wrappers for algorithmic and data resources that in-teroperate with the database and interface."]},{"title":"GDM","paragraphs":["GDM is based on the TIPSTER document manager. It provides a central repository or server that stores all the information an LE system generates about the texts it processes. All communication between the system components goes through GDM, thereby insulating parts from each other and providing a uniform API (applications programmer interface) for manipulating the data produced by the system. 1 Benefits of this approach include the ability to exploit the maturity and efficiency of database technology, easy modelling of blackboard-type distributed control regimes (of the type proposed by [2]), and reduced interdependence of components. GGI GGI is a graphical launchpad for LE subsystems, and provides various facilities for testing and viewing results, and interactively assembling LE components into different system configurations. As we built Sheffield's MUC-6 entry, LaSIE [6], it was of-ten the case that we were unsure of the implications for system performance of using tagger X instead of tagger Y, or gazetteer A instead of pattern matcher B. In the GGI interface, substitution of components is a point-and-click operation. This facility supports hybrid systems, ease of upgrading and open systems-style module interchangeability. 2","Figure 1 shows the launchpad for a MUC-6 IE system. Colours are used to indicate the status of each component with respect to the current document/collection: dark (red) components have already been run and their results are available for viewing; light (green) components have all their required in-puts available and are ready to run, and grey (amber) components require a currently unavailable input be-fore they can become runnable. IWhere very large data sets need passing between modules, other external databases can be employed if necessary. 2Note that delivered systems can use GDM and CREOLE without GGI."]},{"title":"121","paragraphs":["Figure 1: GGI - the GATE Graphical Interface CREOLE In a GATE-based system, the real work of processing texts - analysis, summarisation, translation, etc. -","is done by CREOLE modules. Note that we use the terms module and object rather loosely to mean interfaces to resources which may be predominantly algorithmic or predominantly data, or a mixture of both. We exploit object-orientation for reasons of modularity, coupling and cohesion, fluency of modelling and ease of reuse (see e.g. [3]).","A CREOLE object may be a wrapper around a pre-existing LE module or database (e.g. a tagger or parser, a lexicon or n-gram index), or may be developed from scratch to conform to the TIPSTER architecture. In either case, the object provides a standardised API to the underlying resources, with access via GGI and I/O via GDM."]},{"title":"MULTEXT compatibility","paragraphs":["MULTEXT [9, 5, 1] was an EU project to produce tools for multilingual corpus annotation and sample corpora marked-up according to the same standards used to drive the tool development. Annotation tools currently developed perform text segmentation, POS tagging, morphological analysis and parallel text alignment. The project has defined an architecture centred on a model of the data passed between the various phases of processing implemented by the tools. The MULTEXT architecture is based on a commitment to TEI-style [8] SGML [7] encoding of information about text. The TEI defines standard tag sets for a range of purposes including many relevant to LE systems. Tools in a MULTEXT system communicate via interfaces specified as SGML document type definitions (DTDs - essentially tag set descriptions).","The MULTEXT tools are currently in use and are recommended by the EU. GATE plans to support conversions between TIPSTER annotations and MULTEXT SGML markup, allowing data produced by the TIPSTER-compliant CREOLE modules to be written out in SGML for processing by MULTEXT tools, and the SGML results then converted back into native format. The extensive work done on SGML processing in MULTEXT could usefully fill a gap in the current TIPSTER model, in which SGML capability is not fully specified. Integration of the results of both projects would seem to be the best of both worlds, and we hope to achieve this in GATE."]},{"title":"TIPSTER in EU Projects","paragraphs":["The Sheffield NLP group is moving all its research and development work to GATE, and therefore to the TIPSTER architecture.

And as increasing numbers of CREOLE modules and databases become available, through collaboration with sites able to provide single LE components, e.g. from the MULTEXT tools, we expect GATE, and therefore the TIPSTER architec- [5] ture, to become widely used in the LE research community."]},{"title":"Availability of GATE","paragraphs":["GATE is freely available for research purposes.
