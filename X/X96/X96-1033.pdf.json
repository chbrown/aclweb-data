The experiments used FBIS documents from four categories, and the measures used were the ff.idf and Cosine similarity measures, and a maximum likelihood estimate based on ass~lming a Multinomial Distribution for the various topics (populations). In addition, the SMART program was run with 'lnc.ltc' weighting and compared to the others.","Decisions for both our classification scheme (documents are put into any number of disjoint categories) and our routing scheme (documents are assigned a 'score' and ranked relative to each category) are based on the highest probability for correct classification or routing. All of the techniques described here are fully automatic, and use a training set of relevant documents to produce lists of distin~i~hin£ terms and weights. All methods (ours and the ones we compared to) gave excellent results for the classification task, while the one based on the Multinomial Distribution produced the best results on the routing task."]},{"title":"2.

Similarly, most people can tell that the second passage is from a sports article, even though the word 'sport' is never mentioned.","\"Before the release of his last studio album, 1993\"s 'Ten Summoner's Tales', Sting commented that he could no longer put his whole heart into his work; it left him feeling too vulnerable. Not surprisingly, that disc was well-crafted, but a bit void of feeling--unfortunate, considering the wondrous synergy of heart and craft on Sting's masterwork, 1987's 'Nothing Like the Sun'. Sadly, 'Mercury Falling' makes 'Ten Summoner's Tales' seem brilliant by comparison, lf s as if Sting only made it because he looked at his calendar one day and realized, by golly, that it was time to make another record. Easily the worst album of what has until now been a remarkably successful career, the disc is aptly named: the temperature never seems to rise on this turgid effort.\""]},{"title":"I21","paragraphs":["\"Walter McCarty scored 24 points and Antoine Walker had 14 and nine rebounds as Kentucky pulled away in the second half to beat upstart San Jose State, 110-72, in the first round of the Midwest Regional in Dallas.","The Wildcats (28-3), who are seeking their first national championship since 1978, will meet the winner of the Wisconsin-Green Bay-Virginia Tech game on Saturday at Reunion Arena.","San Jose State, which was making its first NCAA Tournament appearance, gave Kentucky all it could handle in the first half, tying the game at 37-37 with 2:50 to play.

The Mathematical Model","paragraphs":["The mathematical model used here is to represent each category as a multinomial distribution. Parameters are estimated from the frequency of certain sets of words and phrases (the'distinguishing word sets') found in the training collections.","Previous results (Guthrie et al 1994) indicate that the simple statistical technique of the maximum likelihood ratio test would, under certain conditions, give rise to an excellent classification scheme for documents. Previous theoretical results were verified using two classes of documents, and excellent recall and precision scores were achieved for distinguishing topics (previous tests were conducted in both Japanese and English). In this paper we both extend the classification scheme to include any number of topics and modify the scheme to also perform routing.","In modeling a class of text, our technique requires that we identify a set of key concepts, or distinguishing words and phrases. The intuition is given in the example above, but in this work we want to automate the process of choosing word sets in a way that results in sets of 'distinguishing concepts'.","In (Guthrie et al 1994), it was shown that if the probabilities of the distinguishing word sets in each of the classes is known, we can predict the probability of correct classification. Our goal eventually is to define an algorithm for choosing 'distinmlishing word sets' in an optimal way; i.e. a way that will maximize the probability of correct classification. The method we use now (described in section 4.1.) is empirical, but allows us to guarantee excellent classification results."]},{"title":"2.3. Common Approaches","paragraphs":["Schemes for classification and routing all teild to follow a particular paradigm:","1. Represent each class (or topic or profile or bucket) as a numerical object.","2. Represent each new document that arrives as a numerical object.","3. Measure the 'similarity' between the new document and each of the classes.","4. For Classification - Place the new document in the category corresponding to the class (or bucket or prc~'fle) to which it is most similar. For Routing - Rank the document in the class using some function of the similarity measure.","Althon£h many similarity measures have been studied, two of them seem to have gained popularity in the recent literature: the Cosine and tf.idf measures. The Cosine measure is used when a document is represented as a multi-dimensional vector, and a document is defreed as more similar to Class 1 than Class 2 if its corresponding vector is closer to that of Class 1 than to that of Class 2. In ff.idf a document is more similar to Class 1 than Class 2 if more terms match the Class 1 terms than do the Class 2 terms. In our work a document is more similar to Class 1 than Class 2 if the probability of it be-longing to Class 1 is greater than the probability of it be-longing to Class 2.","In choosing a representation of a class or a representation of a document, much of the current research in classification and routing is focused on choosing the best set of terms (in our case, we call them Distinguishing Terms) to represent it. Many systems start with prevalent but not common (so that words such as 'the' and 'to' are not used) words and phrases in the class training set. The training set may be as small as the initial query which defined the class or as large as all of the documents which are available which are deemed to be relevant to the class. If this set of terms is too small, feedback is generally employed in which the full corpus of documents to be classified and routed is compared to the set, prevalent words and phrases from highly ranked retrieved documents are added to the set, and the full corpus is run again against the larger set of terms."]},{"title":"2.4. Probabilistic Classification Approach Using Multinomial Distribution","paragraphs":["A probabilistic method for classification was proposed by Guthrle and Walker [1], which assumed each class was distributed by the multinomial distribution. Elementary statistics tells us that a maximum likelihood ratio test is the best way to calculate the probability that a set of outcomes was produced by a given input. In the example below, we assume a multinomial distribution for our dice and fred the largest conditional probability of getting a certain output given a certain input. For ex-168 ample, consider the set of outcomes produced by rolling one of two single six-sided dice. One of the dice is fair and one is loaded to be more likely to give a '6' outcome. Let us assign the expected probabilities for the outcomes for each of the two dice. Die Fair Loaded","Outcome 1 2 3 4 5 6","Probability 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/10 1/10 1/10 1/10 1/10 1/2 Table 2.3-1. Expected Probabilities Now let us defme three sets of outputs.

Output Fair Die Loaded Die set 1 3.46 x 10 -4 1.33 x 10- 7 set 2 4.09 x 10- 6 5.25 x 10- 4 set 3 7.07 x 10- s 4.71 x 10- 5 Table 2.3-3. Probability of Output","The most likely die to produce each output is the one with the maximum probability. We can see that these probabilities are an excellent measure for determining which of the dice was more likely to be used to generate each of the sets of outcomes. Set 1, which has a fairly uniform distribution, is much more likely to have been created with the fair die than the loaded one. Set 2, which has nearly half of the outcomes as '6', is much more likely to have been created with the loaded die than the fair one. Set 3 does not have an obvious distribution. It has more '6' outccanes than would be expected with the fair die. but not as many as would be expected with the loaded die. As it turns out, it is just slightly more likely that the fair die was used to generate set 3.","Applying this approach to the document classification problem, we may define the outcomes to be the sets of Distinguish Terms which deAr'me the classes. The expected probabilities are then the sum of the frequencies of the Distinguishing Terms in each of the classes divided by the training set lengths. The outputs are the counts of how many of the Distinguishing Terms from each class are evident in a document. Since to create a multinc~nial distribution all possible outcomes must be accounted for, an additional count is kept of all of the words in a document are not members of any of the Disfinguishing Term sets. The expected probability for this set of words is 1.0 minus the sum of the probabilities of all of the Distinguishing Terms in the Iraining set. 2.5. Probabilistic Routing Approach Using Multinomial Distribution","Expa~dino¢ this approach to the routing problem, we want to fred the most likely class given the probabilities of the outputs. This can be calculated with Bayes' Theoreln, using the assumption that all classes have equally likely occurrences.","P(output I classi) P(classi I output) = P(output)","Continuing the example with the fair and the loaded die, the sets are assigned probabilities that they belong to each of the classes given the fact that they have a certain set of outcomes. This would result in the following probabilities. Output Fair Die Loaded Die set I 0.999616 0.000384 set 2 0.007730 0.992270 set 3 0.600170 0.388830","Table 2.3-4. Probability of Class","Sorting these probabilities, we get the expected resuits; set 1 is the output most likely to have been created with the fair die and set 2 the least, and set 2 is the output most likely to have been created with the loaded die and set 1 the least.","Comparing these routing results to the classification results, the question may be raised why the probability that a set is from a class needs to be calculated. Ranking with the probability of getting the outputs (Table 2.3-3) would have given the same ranking. But now consider the case in which set 3 was ten times larger, as shown in the table below. 169 Output set"]},{"title":"1 set 2 set 3","paragraphs":["Outcome"]},{"title":"1 2 3 4 5 6","paragraphs":["Count 5 4 4 6 5 4 2 3 1 2 4 10 30 40 20 50 40 80 Table 2.3-5. Outputs","Our expectation is still that set 3 should be ranked in the middle, between sets 1 and 2 for each die. Calculat-ing the probabilities of getting these outputs, we get the following table. Output Fair Die Loaded Die set 1 3.46 x 10 --4 1.33 x 10 -7 set 2 4.09 x 10- 6 5.25 x 10- 4 set 3 1.96 x 10-16 3.39 x 10-18 Table 2.3-6. Probability of Output","Using these probabilities directly for ranking would place set 3 on the bottom of each list, which does not agree with intuition. Note that this problem is the same problem that document retrieval systems have with doeuments of varying lengths; longer documents are ranked lower than they should be. But now we take the second step of calculating the probability that an output is in a class. Output Fair Die Loaded Die set 1 0.999616 0.000384 set 2 0.007730 0.992270 set 3 0.982998 0.017002 Table 2.3-7. Probability of Class","We can see that now the rankings are as we expect; set 1 is the output most likely to have been created with the fair die and set 2 the least, and set 2 is the output most likely to have been created with the loaded die and set 1 the least. So using this multinomial distribution to rank documents is less likely to be adversely affected by varying document lengths. 3. APPROACH","Below is a description of the different approaches implemented for calculating the match between a document and a class profile. The class scores are then compared to each other to determine the classification and routing results. 3.1.

The weights for all of the Distinguishing Terms in a set are combined into a single value, called the set weight. An additional weight is calculated, which is necessary for the multinomial distribution. This is the probability that a term is not a Distinguiqhlng Term, and is calculated as 1.0 minus the sum of the probabilities of all of the Distinguishing Terms in the training set.

The Multinomial Distribution method works best if the Distingalishlng Terms for each class are more lilfely to be in the class than in another class, so the method which worked best was to choose the words which occur more often in one list than in all other lists combined until the sum of the probabilities of the chosen words was at least 25%."]},{"title":"6.2.

Future work with TREC data will determine whether these are repeatable results or whether the small test data was particularly well tuned to the Multinomial Distribution method.","Although we anticipate improvements to all of the methods through the use of phrases, feedback, term expansion and clustering, these have not yet been implemented. Future efforts will investigate these modifications°","This test for classification and routing was much simpler than the TREC task, since the size of the corpus was significantly smaller and less diverse and every document was relevant to a single category. This produced results which were close to perfect for all of the methods, and the Multinomial Distribution method was less than 1% different than the SMART method in clas-175 sification, and only 5% better in routing. However. since the TREC data is very diverse and is classified into fifty classes, the Mulfinomial Distribution method is expected to perform even better than the other methods, as it is particularly good at distingui~qhing fine detail between classes."]},{"title":"8.
