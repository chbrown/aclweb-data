This is different from the English system, which uses the pattern matching mechanism for named entity detection. In the Japanese system, this is done by an independent program which uses a decision tree technique to assign tags of named entity information to the input text (Sekine 98).","The next two modules employ regular expression"]},{"title":"pattern matching,","paragraphs":["applying patterns of successively increasing complexity to the document.

The patterns - the regular expressions with their associated actions, -- are encoded in a special pattern specification language, and are compiled and stored in a separate pattern base.

The numbers of patterns between the two systems are slightly different mainly due to the difference in the methods of detecting named entities.

There were programming level difficulties because its window system is developed using GARNET, a graphical system for LISP, which does not support the Japanese language. 4 Evaluation Table 2 shows the result of the information extraction experiment for English and Japanese. The English results are based on the formal MUC-6 experiment. The Japanese experiment is conducted using Nikkei newspaper articles on the same domain, \"executive succession events\". We spent about two months of one person's part-time labor to develop the patterns. Actually, the developer created the patterns at the same time as he developed the Japanese system. It achieves a slightly better score. This may due to the fact that he spent more time than that spent for the English rule creation (one month), or due to the tendency we found that there is a typical document style for this kind of articles. The latter is not clear as we have not investigated the English articles."]},{"title":"5 Future Work","paragraphs":["Structural generalization In the English system, there is a facility to generalize a pattern based on structural variation. For example, an active mood pattern can be generalized to a passive pattern or a relative clause pattern. A similar mechanism might be useful in Japanese. Japanese is known as a free word-order language. In principle, a pattern can be generalized based on this property of Japanese, but there are some exceptions and some heuristics should be considered. Reference resolution for zero pronoun In Japanese, subject or object nouns can some-times be omitted. It is a difficult problem to recover the noun, but we found several cases where such technologies are needed to achieve better performance."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The English Proteus Information Extraction system, on which this work is based, was developed by Professor Ralph Grishman.
