We have focused our investigations in four related research areas:","1. High Precision Information Retrieval. The goal of our research in this area is to increase the accuracy of the set of documents given to the user.","2. Near-Duplicate Detection. The goal of our work in near-duplicate detection is to develop methods for delineating or removing from the set of retrieved documents any information that the user has already seen.","3. Context-Dependent Document Summarization. The goal of our research in this area is to provide for each document a short summary that includes only those portions of the document relevant to the query.","4. Context-Dependent Multi-Document Summarization. The goal of our research in this area is to provide a short summary for an entire group of related documents that includes only query-related portions. Taken as a whole, our research aims to increase end-user efficiency in each of the above tasks by reducing the amount of text that the user must peruse in order to get the desired useful information.","We attack each task through a combination of statistical and linguistic approaches. The proposed statistical approaches extend existing methods in IR by performing statistical computations within the context of another query or document. The proposed linguistic approaches build on existing work in information extraction and rely on a new technique for trainable partial parsing. In short, our integrated approach uses both statistical and linguistic sources to identify selected relationships among important terms in a query or text. The relationships are encoded as TIPSTER annotations [7]. We then use the extracted relationships: (1) to discard or reorder retrieved texts (for high-precision text retrieval); (2) to locate redundant information (for near-duplicate document detection); and (3) to generate coherent synopses (for context-dependent text summarization).","An end-user scenario that takes advantage of the efficiency opportunities offered by our research might proceed as follows: 1. The user submits a natural language query to the retrieval system, asking for a high-precision search. This search will attempt to retrieve fewer documents than a normal search, but at a higher quality, so many fewer non-useful documents will need to be examined. 2. The documents in the result set will be clustered so that closely related documents are grouped. Duplicate documents will be clearly marked so the user will not have to look at them at all. Near-duplicate documents will also be clearly marked. When the user examines a document marked as a near-duplicate to a document previously examined, the new material in this document is emphasized in color so that it can be quickly perused, while the duplicate material can be ignored. 3. Long documents can be automatically summarized, within the context of the query, so that perhaps only 20% of the document will be presented. This 20% summary"]},{"title":"107","paragraphs":["would include the material that made the system decide the document was useful, as well as other material designed to set the context for the query-related material. 4. If the user wishes, an entire cluster of documents can be summarized. The user can then decide whether to look at any of the individual documents. This multi-document summary will once again be query-related.","One key result of our TIPSTER efforts is the development of TRUESmart, a Toolbox for Research in User Efficiency. TRUESmart is a set of tools and data supporting researchers in the development of methods for improving user efficiency for state-of-the-art information retrieval systems. TRUESmart allows the integration of system components for high-precision retrieval, duplicate detection, and context-dependent summarization; it includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that supports each of these tasks in the context of the end-user scenario described above. In addition, TRUESmart aids system evaluation and analysis by highlighting important term relationships identified by the underlying statistical and linguistic language processing algorithms.","The rest of the paper presents TRUESmart and its underlying IR and NLP components. Section 2 first provides an overview of the Smart IR system and the Empire Natural Language Processing (NLP) system. Section 3 describes the TRUESmart toolbox. To date, we have used TRUESmart to support our work in high-precision retrieval and context-dependent document summarization. We describe our results in these areas in Sections 4-5 using the TRUESmart interface to illustrate the algorithms developed and their contribution to the end-user scenario described above. Section 6 summarizes our work in duplicate detection and describes how the TRUESmart interface will easily be extended to support this task and include linguistic term relationships in addition to statistical term relationships. We conclude with a summary of the potential advantages of our overall approach."]},{"title":"2 THE UNDERLYING SYSTEMS: SMART AND EMPIRE","paragraphs":["The two main foundations of our research are the Smart system for Information Retrieval and the Empire system for Natural Language Processing.

Salton. The new version is approximately 50,000 lines of C code and documentation.","Smart Version 13 offers a basic framework for investigations of the vector space and related models of information retrieval. Documents are fully automatically indexed, with each document representation being a weighted vector of concepts, the weight indicating the importance of a concept to that particular document. The document representatives are stored on disk as an inverted file. Natural language queries undergo the same indexing process. The query representative vector is then compared with the indexed document representatives to arrive at a similarity and the documents are then fully ranked by similarity.","Smart Version 13 is highly flexible (i.e., its algorithms can be easily adapted for a variety of IR tasks) and very fast, thus providing an ideal platform for information retrieval experimentation. Documents are indexed at a rate of almost two gigabytes an hour, on systems currently costing under $5,000 (for example, a dual Pentium Pro 200 Mhz with 512 megabytes memory and disk). Retrieval speed is similarly fast, with basic simple searches taking much less than a second a query."]},{"title":"2.2 The Empire System: A Trainable Partial Parser","paragraphs":["Stated simply, the goal of the natural language processing (NLP) component for the selected text retrieval tasks is to locate linguistic relationships between query terms. For this, we have developed Empire 1, a trainable partial parser. The remainder of this section describes the as-sumptions of our approach and the general architecture of the system.","For the TIPSTER project, we are investigating the role of linguistic relationships in information retrieval tasks. A linguistic relationship between two terms is any relationship that can be determined through syntactic or semantic interpretation of the text that contains the terms. We are focusing on three classes of linguistic relationships that we believe will aid the information retrieval tasks: 1. noun"]},{"title":"phrase relationships.","paragraphs":["E.g., determine whether two query terms appear in the same (simple) noun phrase; find all places where a query term appears as the head of a noun phrase.","1 The name refers to our focus on empirical methods for development and evaluation of the system. 108","2.

Noun phrase coreference will allow Smart to create more coherent summaries, e.g., by replacing pronouns with their referents as identified by Empire. In addition, Smart can use coreference relationships to modify its term weighting function to reflect the implied equality between all elements of a noun phrase equivalence class.","Once identified, the linguistic relationships can be employed in a number of ways to improve the efficiency of end-users: they can be used (1) to prefer the retrieval of documents that also exhibit the relationships; (2) to indicate the presence of redundant information; or (3) to es-tablish the necessary context in automatically generated summaries. Our approach to locating linguistic relationships is based on the following assumptions:","• The NLP system need recognize only those relationships that are useful for the specific text retrieval application. There may be no need for full-blown syntactic and semantic analysis of queries and documents.","• The NLP system must recognize these relationships both quickly and accurately. The speed requirement argues for a shallow linguistic analysis; the accuracy requirement argues for algorithms that focus on precision rather than recall.","• The NLP component need only provide a comparative linguistic analysis between a document and a query. This should simplify the NLP task because individual documents do not have to be analyzed in isolation, but only relative to the query. Given thcse assumptions, we have developed Empire, a fast, trainable, precision-based partial parser. As a partial parser, Empire performs only shallow syntactic analysis of input texts. Like many partial parsers and NLP systems lk~r information extraction (e.g., Hobbs et al. [9]), Empire relies primarily on finite-state technology [16] to recognize all syntactic and semantic entities as well as their relationships to one another. Parsing proceeds in stages -- the initial stages identit~¢ relatively simple constituents: Pruning Corpus Improved Rule Set Final Rule Set Figure 1 : Error-Driven Pruning of Treebank Grammars simple noun phrases, some prepositional phrases, verb groups, and clauses. All linguistic relationships that require higher-level attachment decisions are identified in subsequent stages and rely on output from earlier stages. Our use of finite-state transducers for partial parsing is most similar to the work of Abney [1], who employs a series of cascaded finite-state machines to build up an increasingly complex linguistic analysis of an incoming sentence.","Unlike most work in this area, however, we do not use hand-crafted patterns to drive the linguistic analysis. In-stead, we rely on corpus-based learning algorithms to acquire the grammars necessary for driving each level of linguistic relationship identification. In particular, we have developed a very simple, yet effective technique for automating the acquisition of grammars through error-driven pruning oftreebank grammars [6]. As shown in Figure 1, the method first extracts an initial grammar from a \"treebank\" corpus, i.e., a corpus that has been annotated with respect to the linguistic relationship of interest. Consider the base noun phrase relationship -- the identification of simple, non-recursive noun phrases. Accurate identification of base noun phrases is a critical component of any partial parser; in addition, Smart relies on base NPs as its primary source of linguistic phrase information. To extract a grammar for base noun phrase identification, we tag the training text with a part-of-speech tagger (we use Mitre's version of Brill's tagger [3]) and then extract as an NP rule every unique part-of-speech sequence that covers a base NP annotation.","Next, the grammar is improved by discarding rules that obtain a low precision-based \"benefit\" score when applied to a held out portion of the training corpus, the pruning corpus. The resulting \"grammar\" can then be used to identify base NPs in a novel text as follows:"]},{"title":"109","paragraphs":["1. Run all lower-level annotators. For base NPs, for example, run the part-of-speech annotator.","2. Proceed through the tagged text from left to right, at each point matching the rules against the remaining input. For base NP recognition, match the NP rules against the remaining part-of-speech tags in the text.","3. If there are multiple rules that match beginning at tag or token ti, use the longest matching rule R. Begin the matching process anew at the token that follows the last NP. 2.2.1 Empire Evaluation Using this simple grammar extraction and pruning algorithm with the naive longest-match heuristic for applying rules to incoming text, the learned grammars are shown to perform very well for base noun phrase identification. A detailed description of the base noun phrase finder and its evaluation can be found in Cardie and Pierce [6]. In summary, however, we have evaluated the approach on two base NP corpora derived from the Penn Treebank [11]. The algorithm achieves 91% precision and recall on base NPs that correspond directly to non-recursive noun phrases in the treebank; it achieves 94% precision and recall on slightly less complicated noun phrases. 2","We are currently investigating the use of error-driven grammar pruning to infer the grammars for all phases of partial parsing and the associated linguistic relationship identification. Initial results on verb-object recognition show 72% precision when tested on a corpus derived from the Penn Treebank. Analysis of the results indicates that our context-free approach, which worked very well for noun phrase recognition, does not yield sufficient accuracy for verb-object recognition. As a result, we have used standard machine learning algorithms (i.e., k-nearest neighbor and memory-based learning using the value-difference metric) to classify each proposed verb-object bracketing as either correct or incorrect given a 2-word window surrounding the bracketing. In preliminary experiments, the machine learning algorithm obtains 84% generalization accuracy. If we discard all bracketings it classifies as incorrect, overall precision for verb-object recognition increases from 72% to over 80%. The next section outlines our general approach for using learning algorithms in conjunction with the Empire system.","2This corpus further simplifies some of the the Treebank base NPs by removing ambiguities that we expect other components of our NLP system to handle, including: conjunctions, NPs with leading and trailing adverbs and verbs, and NPs that contain prepositions. 2.2.2 The Role of Machine Learning Algorithms As noted above, Empire's finite-state partial parsing methods may not be adequate for identifying some linguistic relationships. At a minimum, many linguistic relationships are better identified by taking additional context into account. In these circumstances, we propose the use of corpus-based machine learning techniques -- both as a systematic means for correcting errors (as done for verb-object recognition above) and for learning to identify linguistic relationships that are more complex than those covered by the finite-state methods above.","In particular, we have employed the Kenmorc knowledge acquisition framework for NLP systems [4, 5]. Kenmore relies on three major components. First, it requires an annotated training corpus, i.e., a collection of on-line documents, that has been annotated with the necessary bracketing information. Second, it requires a robust sentence analyzer, or parser. For this, we use the Empire partial parser. Finally, the framework requires an inductive learning algorithm. Although any inductive learning algorithm can be used, we have successfully used case-based learning (CBL) algorithms for a number of natural language learning problems.","There are two phases to the framework: (1) a partially automated training phase, or acquisition phase, in which a particular linguistic relationship is learned, and (2) an application phase, in which the heuristics learned during training can be used to identify the linguistic relationship in novel texts. More specifically, the goal of Kenmore's training phase (see Figure 2) is to create a case base, or memory, of linguistic relationship decisions. To do this, the system randomly selects a set of training sentences from the annotated corpus. Next, the sentence analyzer processes the selected training sentences, creating one case for every instance of the linguistic relationship that occurs. As shown in Figure 2, each case has two parts. The context portion of the case encodes the context in which the linguistic relationship was encountered -- this is essentially a representation of some or all of the constituents in the neighborhood of the linguistic relationship as denoted in the flat syntactic analysis produced by the parser. The solution portion of the case describes how the linguistic relationship was resolved in the current example. In the training phase, this solution information is extracted directly from the annotated corpus. As the cases are created, they are stored in the case base.","After training, the NLP system uses the case base without the annotated corpus to identify new occurrences of the linguistic relationship in novel sentences. Given a sentence as input, the sentence analyzer processes the sentence and creates a problem case, automatically filling in its context portion based on the constituents appearing the 110 Annotate~ linguistic relationship solution"]},{"title":"I t linguistic ~ relationships elected sentences I' to identify Sentence [ ~ [Training Case I conte oflinguistic i ,ela ions p l conte= Isolation I","paragraphs":["episode in linguistic relationship identification t"]},{"title":"i Case-Based Reasoning Component I","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Kenmore Training/Acquisition Phase. sentence. To determine whether the linguistic relationship holds, Kenmore next compares the problem case to each case in the case base, retrieves the most similar training case, and returns the decision as indicated in the solution part of the case. The solution information lets Empire decide whether the desired relationship exists in the current sentence.","In previous work, we have used Kenmore for part-of-speech tagging, semantic feature tagging, information extraction concept acquisition, and relative pronoun resolution [5]. We expect that this approach will be necessary for coreference resolution, for some types of subject-object identification, and for handling gap constructs (i.e., tbr determining that \"boy\" is the subject of \"ate\" as well as the object of \"saw\" in \"Billy saw the boy that ate the candy\"). It is also the approach used to learn the verb-object correction \"heuristics\" described in the last section."]},{"title":"2.2.3 Coreference Resolution","paragraphs":["The final class of linguistic relationship is"]},{"title":"noun phrase eoreference","paragraphs":["-- for every entity in a text, the NLP system must locate all of the expressions or phrases that refer to it.

Smart can use this coreference information to treat the associated terms as equivalents. For example, it can assume that all items in the class are present whenever one appears. In conjunction with coreference resolution, we are also investigating the usefulness of providing the IR system with canonicalized noun phrase forms that make use of term invariants identified during coreference.","To date, we have implemented two simple algorithms for coreference resolution to use purely as baselines. Both operate only on base noun phrases as identified by Empire's base NP finder. The first heuristic assumes that two noun phrases are coreferent if they share any terms in common. The second assumes that two noun phrases are coreferent if they have the same head. Both obtained higher scores than expected when tested on the MUC6 coreference data set.

TREC provides a number of document collections rang-ing up to 500,000 documents in size, along with queries and relevance judgements that tell whether a document is relevant to a particular query.","Evaluation of our high-precision research can be done directly using the TREC collections. The TREC documents, queries, and relevance judgements are sufficient to evaluate whether particular high-precision algorithms do better than others.","For summarization research, however, a different testbed is needed. The SUMMAC workshop evaluated summaries of documents. The major evaluation measured whether human judges were able to judge relevance of entire documents just from the summaries. While very valuable in giving a one-time absolute measure of how well summarization algorithms are doing, human-dependent evaluations are infeasible for a research group to perform on ongoing research since different human assessors are required whenever a given document or summary is judged.","Our summarization testbed is based on the SUMMAC QandA evaluation. Given a set of questions about a document, and a key describing the locations in the document where those questions are answered, the goal is to evaluate how well an extraction-based summary of that document answers the questions. So the TRUESmart summarization testbed consists of • A small number of queries • A small number of relevant documents per query • A set of questions for each query","• Locations in the relevant documents where each question is answered.","Objective evaluation of near-duplicate information detection is difficult. As part of our efforts in this area, we have constructed a small set (50 pairs) of near-duplicate documents of newswire articles. These pairs were deliberately chosen to encompass a range of duplication amounts; we include 5 pairs at cosine similarity .95, 5 pairs at .90, and 10 pairs at each of .85, .80, .75, and .70. In addition, they have been categorized as to exactly what the relationship between the pairs is. For example, some pairs are slight rewrites by the same author, some are followup articles, and some are two articles on the same subject by different authors. We also have queries that will retrieve both of these pairs among the top documents. These articles are tagged: corresponding sections of text from each document pair are marked as identical, semantically equivalent, or different.","Preparing a testbed for multi-document summarization is even more difficult. We have not done this as yet, but our initial approach will take as a seed the QandA evaluation test collections described above. This gives us a query and a set of relevant documents with known answers to a set of common questions. Evaluation can be done by performing a multi-document summarization on a subgroup of this set of relevant documents. The final summary can be evaluated based upon how many questions are answered (a question is answered by a text excerpt in the summary if the excerpt in the corresponding original document was marked as answering the question), and how many questions are answered more than once. If too many questions are answered more than once, then the duplicate detection algorithms may not be working optimally. If too few questions are answered at all, then the summarization algorithms may be at fault. The evaluation numbers produced by the final summary can be compared against the average evaluation numbers for the documents in the group."]},{"title":"3.2 TRUESmart Evaluation","paragraphs":["Automatic evaluation of research algorithms is critical for rapid progress in all of these areas. Manual evaluation is 112 valuable, but impractical when trying to distinguish between small variations of a research group's algorithms."]},{"title":"3.2.1 Trec_eval","paragraphs":["Automatic evaluation of straight information retrieval tasks is not new. In particular, we have provided the \"trec_eval\" program to the TREC community to evaluate retrieval in the TREC environment. It will also be an evaluation component in the TRUESmart ToolBox. The trec_eval measures are described in the TREC-4 workshop proceedings [8]. 3.2.2 Summ_eval The QandA evaluation of SUMMAC is very close to being automatic once questions and keys are created. For SUMMAC, the human assessors still judge whether or not a given summary answers the questions. Indeed, for non-extraction-based summaries, this is required. But for evaluation of extraction-based summarization (where the summaries contain clauses, sentences, or paragraphs of the original document), an automatic approximation of the assessor task is possible. This enables a research group to fairly evaluate and compare multiple summaries of the same document, with no additional manual effort after the initial key is determined. Thus we have written the \"summ_eval\" evaluator. This algorithm for the automatic evaluation of summaries:","1. Automatically finds the spans of the text of the original document that were given as answers in the keys.","2. Automatically finds the spans of the text of the original document that appeared in a summarization of the document.","3. Computes various measures of overlap between the summarization spans and the answer spans. The effectiveness of two summarization algorithms can be automatically compared by comparing these overlap measures.","We ran summ_eval on the summaries produced by the systems of the SUMMAC workshop. The comparative ranking of systems using summ_eval is very close to the (presumably) optimal rankings using human assessors. This strongly suggests that automatic scoring of summ_eval can be useful for evaluation in circumstances where human scoring is not available"]},{"title":"3.2.3 Dup_eval","paragraphs":["\"Dup_eval\" uses the same algorithms as summ_eval to measure how well an algorithm can detect whether one document contains information that is duplicated in another.

The duplicate detection algorithm being evaluated will come up with similar spans. Dup_eval measures the overlap between the these sets of spans."]},{"title":"3.3 TRUESmart GUI","paragraphs":["Automatic evaluation is only the beginning of the research process.

This analysis is often time-consuming and painful. This motivates the implementation of the TRUESmart GUI. This GUI is not aimed at being a prototype of a user efficiency GUI. Instead, it offers a basic end-user interface while giving the researcher the ability to explore the underlying causes of particular algorithm behavior.","Figure 3 shows the basic TRUESmart GUI as used to support high-precision retrieval and context-dependent summarization. The user begins by typing a query into the text input box in the middle, left frame.

Clicking on any document will cause its query-dependent summary to be displayed in the large frame on the right. In Figure 3, the summary of the seventh document is displayed. In this run, we have set Smart's target summary length to 25% and asked for sentence- (rather than paragraph-) based summaries.

If it doesn't the document is removed from the retrieved set; otherwise, the document remains in the final retrieved set with a score that combines the global and local score. In addition, the user can supply relevance judgements on any document by clicking Rel (relevant), NRel (not relevant), or PRel (probably relevant). Smart uses these judgements as feedback, updating the ranking after every 5 judgements by adding new documents and removing those already judged from the list of retrieved texts. Figure 4 shows the state of the session after a number of relevance judgements have been made and new documents have been added to the top 20.","The interface, while basic, is valuable in its own right. It was successfully used for the Cornell/SablR experiments in the TREC 7 High-Precision track. In this task, users were asked to find 15 relevant documents within 5 minutes for each of 50 queries. This was a true test of user efficiency; and Cornell/SablR did very well.","The most important use of the GUI, though, is to explore what is happening underneath the surface, in order to aid the researcher. Operating on either a single document or a cluster of documents, the researcher can request several different views. The two main paradigms are: (1) the document map view, which visually indicates the relationships between parts of the selected document(s); and (2) the document annotation view, which displays any subset of the available annotations for the selected document(s). Neither view is shown in Figures 3 and 4.","The document annotation view, in particular, is extremely flexible. The interface allows the user to run any of the available annotators on a document (or document set). Each annotator returns the text(s) and the set of annotations computed for the text(s). The GUI, in turn, displays the text with the spans of each annotation type highlighted in a different color. Optionally, the values of each annotation can be displayed in a separate window. Thus, for instance, a document may be returned with one annotation type giving the spans of a document summary, and other annotation types giving the spans of an ideal summary. The researcher can then immediately see what the problems are with the document summary.","There is no limit to the number of possible annotators that can be displayed. Annotators implemented or planned include:","• Query term matches (with values in separate window). • Statistical and/or linguistic phrase matches. • Summary vs. model summary. • Summary vs. QandA answers.","• Two documents concatenated with duplicate information of the second annotated in the first. • Coreferent noun phrases. • Subject, verb, or object term matches.","• Verb-object, subject-verb, and subject-object term matches.","• Subjects or objects of gap constructions annotated with the inferred filler if it matches an important term.","Analyzing the role of linguistic relationships in the IR tasks amounts to requesting the display of some or all of the NLP annotators. For example, the user can request to see linguistic phrase matches as well as statistical phrase matches. In the example from Figure 3, the resulting annotated summary would show \"27 inmates\" and \"Latino inmates\" as matches of the query term \"inmates\" because all instances of \"inmates\" appear as head nouns. Similarly, it would show a linguistic phrase match between \"jail overcrowding\" (paragraph 5 of the summary) and \"jail and prison overcrowding\" (in the query) for the same reason. When the output of the linguistic phrase annotator is requested, the lower left frame that lists query terms and weights is updated to include the linguistic phrases from the query and their corresponding weights.","Alternatively, one might want to analyze the role of the \"subject\" annotator. In the running example, this would modify the summary window to show matches that in-volve terms appearing as the subject of a sentence or clause. For example, all of the following occurrences of \"inmates\" would be marked as subject matches with the \"inmates\" query term, which also appears in the subject position (\"inmates are forced\"): \"inmates were injured\" (paragraph l ), \"inmates broke out\" (paragraph 2), \"inmates refused\" (paragraph 2), \"inmates are confined\" (paragraph 3), etc. Smart can give extra weight to these \"subject\" term matches since entities that appear in this syntactic position are often central topic terms. The interface helps the developer to quickly locate and determine the correctness of subject matches. As an aside, if the \"subject gap construction\" annotator were requested, \"inmates\" would be filled in as the implicit subject of \"return\" in paragraph 2 and would be marked as a query term match. 114 ..... 7. = .~,-. 432478 1 56.80 517694 2 56.48 434848 3 54.80 43~5~5 4 54.31 405413 5 53.85 51.1274 6 52.11 399075 7 51.04 <P> REPORT ~$SAILS CONDITIONS AT ~RTE @) ImitATES TO GET $150 ~ UP IF DEIIlE <?> JUDGES ORDE]~E~ TO OPEN COURT IN N.% <P> \"DEATH LOTTB~Y\" III~TIZES O~OI~IH~ <P> 12 ]NJIJRE~ IN RIOTING AT <P> OI~NGE COUNTY NEMSI~TCH <JP> <JHE~ <P> ~ VISTA JAIL ~ I~TER RIOT FC 186773 8 48.30 I(S061 9 48.02 407707 10 47.71 180349 11 47.01 455171 12 46.78 4348~5 13 48.28 117312 14 45.51 444642 15 45,O0 523364 16 44.74 117307 17 44.57 186014 18 43.77 515147 19 43.2'6 462422 2O 43.21 FT 28 OCT 53 / Tumim ~ of Jail over FT 23 SEP 92 / Pria~n violence tops Fr~ <P> JAIL OOUm.E-~UHK ~ H~ HITCH: NE FT 25 NOV 93 1 Prison oxtonslon plan ar <P> POSTSCRIPT: JAIL PROG~It GIGS INF# <P> ~ OFFENOERS HAY BE JAILED IN TElL FT 30 OCT ~ / Prison condltions attack <P> STIFF TERHS I~E LITTLE IHPACT ON [ <P> L.A, COJHTY'S (~TR~L JAIL: </P> <F FT 30 OCT 9~ / Prison coalitions are at FT I0 ~ 94 / Leadin9 ~'tlcle: Jail <P> CRONOING COHPOIJNI~ ]TIE PRESSURE 4~> JAIL ~DING ~q~ IN COURT AGAIN; Rel ~1 PRel ]The d(x~.ment ulll provide inf~tim on Jail and ~'l~m ~] Ne~Q S~itO HodQ Hod vec 351 0 2¢~ 4.69668 l~'i~ 351 0 ~72101 5.18446 Jail 351 0 3940/9 7.17984 Irmat 351 0 435502 12.54202 owN- ~- end 351 0 442675 2.12707 provld 351 0 467934 4.73140 cond 351 0 46S0~9 5.59571 cope 351 0 515220 2.19704 fore ~51 0 644141 1.80153 plan 351 0 6~9474 4.2~2 relief 351 0 680680 2.26442 inform 351 0 765274 2.13352 docu 3~51 0 7~84 4.15008 reveal 351 1 57596 6.39,327 inform l~ovid 351 1 79370 10.46741 plan r~mal 351 1 1085,.2 11.85068 o~mrcrm~d ~Ison <P> Calm ~ r~t~'ed Surda9 at the Sen Diego County Jail in 01ula Vista after 27 irmat.~ uane injured in a Saturda9 ni9ht riot, authorities said. </P> <P> ~llblock 3-R u~ locked doun ~t~r a .aJor dist.ur'bar~ betueen black and Latino irmato~ l~'oka out in • co~ an~ and the Inmatos r~u~d to return to their cells, said Sen Diego Count4j S}m'iff's Capt. <P>","lock-an, in ~'dch lnmat~ are confined to their cells, ~ lifted after an undi~lo~d nuM~\" of inmates ~ trar~Ferred to oU'mr count9 Jails. 11'm Jail, d~i~d to confine 192 inmates, held 782 on Sate'de. </P> <P> A national surv~ released l~t ~ reported that San Diego's Jails are","nation's ~t ~ detention faniliti~.

In response to this request, the document text window would then be updated to highlight in the same color all of the entities considered in the same coreference equivalence class. As noted above (see Section 2.2), we currently have two simple coreference annotators: one that uses the head noun heuristic and one that uses the overlapping terms heuristic. In our example, the head noun annotator would assume, among other things, that any noun phrase with \"inmates\" as its head refers to the same entity: \"27 inmates\", \"black and Latino inmates\", \"the inmates\", etc. (Note that many of these proposed coreferences are incorrect -- the heuristics are only meant to be used as baselines with which to compare other, better, coreference algorithms.) A quick scan of the text with all of these occurrences highlighted lets the user quickly determine how well the annotator is working for the current example. After limited pronoun resolution is added to the coreference annotator, \"their\" in \"their cells\" (paragraph 2) would also be highlighted as part of the same equivalence class."]},{"title":"4 HIGH-PRECISION INFORMA-TION RETRIEVAL","paragraphs":["In order to maintain general-purpose retrieval capabilities, for example, current IR systems attempt to balance their systems with respect to precision and recall measures. A number of information retrieval tasks, however, require retrieval mechanisms that emphasize precision: users want to see a small number of documents, most of which are deemed useful, rather than being given as many useful documents as possible where the useful documents are mixed in with numerous non-useful documents. As a result, our research in high-precision IR concentrates on improving user time efficiency by showing the user only documents that there is very good reason to believe are useful.","Precision is increased by restricting an already retrieved set of documents to those that meet some additional criteria for relevance. An initial set of documents is retrieved (a global search), and each individual document is reparsed and matched against the query again to see if it satisfies the particular restriction criteria being investigated (local matching). If it does, the document is put into the final retrieved set with a score of some combination of the global and local score. We have investigated a number of re-ranking algorithms. Three are briefly described below: Boolean filters, clusters, and phrases."]},{"title":"4.1 Automatic Boolean Filters","paragraphs":["Smart expands user queries by adding terms occurring in the top documents. Maintaining the focus of the query is difficult while expanding; the query tends to drift away to-wards some one aspect of the query while ignoring other aspects. Therefore, it is useful to have a re-ranking algorithm that emphasizes those top documents which cover all aspects of the query.","In recent work [14], we construct (soft) Boolean filters containing all query aspects and use these for re-ranking. A manually prepared filter can improve average precision by up to 22%. In practice, a user is not going to go to the difficulty of preparing such a filter, however, so an automatic approximation is needed. Aspects are automatically identified by looking at the term-term correlations among the query terms. Highly correlated terms are assumed to belong to the same aspect, and less correlated terms are assumed to be independent aspects. The automatic filter includes all of the independent aspects, and improves average precision by 6 to 13%."]},{"title":"4.2 Clusters","paragraphs":["Clustering the top documents can yield improvements from two sources, as we examine in [12]. First, outlier documents (those documents not strongly related to other documents) can be removed. This works reasonably for many queries. Unfortunately, it fails catastrophically for some hard queries where the outlier may be the only top relevant document! Absolute failures need to be avoided, so this approach is not currently recommended. The second improvement source is to ensure that query expansion terms come from all clusters. This is another method to maintain query focus and balance. A very modest improvement of 2 to 3% is obtained; it appears the Boolean filter approach above is to be preferred, unless clustering is being done for other purposes in any case."]},{"title":"4.3 Phrases","paragraphs":["Traditionally, phrases have been viewed as a precision enhancing device. In [13] and [12], we examine the benefits of using high quality phrases from the Empire system. We discover that the linguistic phrases, when used by themselves without single terms, are better than traditional Smart statistical phrases. However, neither group of phrases substantially improves overall performance over just using single terms, especially at the high precision end. Indeed, phrases tend to help at lower precisions where there are few clues to whether a document is relevant. At the high precision end, query balance is more important."]},{"title":"117","paragraphs":["There are generally several clues to relevance for the high-est ranked documents, and maintaining balance between them is essential. A good phrase match often hurts this balance by over-emphasizing the aspect covered by the phrase."]},{"title":"4.4 TREC 7 High Precision","paragraphs":["Cornell/SablR recently participated in the TREC 7 High Precision (HP) track. In this track, the goal of the user is to find 15 relevant documents to a query within 5 minutes. This is obviously a nice evaluation testbed for user efficient retrieval. We used the TRUESmart GUI and in-corporated the automatic Boolean filters described above into some of our Smart retrievals.","Only preliminary results are available now and once again Cornell/SablR did very well. All 3 of our users did substantially better than the median. One interesting point is that all 3 users are within 1% of each other: The same 3 users participated in the TREC 6 HP track last year with much more varied results. Last year, the hardware speed and choice of query length were different between the users. We attempted to equalize these factors this year. The basically identical results suggest (but the sample is much too small to prove) that our general approach is reasonably user-training independent. The major activity of the user is judging documents, a task for which all users are presumably qualified. The results are bounded by user agreement with the official relevance judgements, and the closeness of the results may indicate we are approaching that upper-bound."]},{"title":"5 CONTEXT-DEPENDENT SUMMARIZATION","paragraphs":["Another application area considered to improve end-user efficiency is reduction of the text of the documents themselves. Longer documents contain a lot of text that may not be of interest to the end-user; techniques that reduce the amount of this text will improve the speed at which the end-user can lind the useful material. This type of summarization differs from our previous work in that the document summaries are produced within the context of a query. This is done by","I. expanding the vocabulary of the query by related words using both a standard Smart cooccurrence based expansion process, and the output of the standard Smart adhoc relevance feedback expansion process;","2. weighting the expanded vocabulary by importance to the query; and","3. performing the Smart summarization using only the weighted expanded vocabulary.","We participated in both the TIPSTER dry run and the SUMMAC evaluations of summarization. Once again we did very well, finishing within the top 2 groups for the SUMMAC adhoc, categorization, and QandA tasks. In-terestingly, the top 3 groups for the QandA task all used Smart for their extraction-based summaries.","Using the summ_eval evaluation tool on the SUMMAC QandA task, we are continuing our investigations into length versus effectiveness, particularly when comparing summaries based on extracting sentences as opposed to paragraphs. As expected, the longer the summary in comparison with the original document, the more effective the summary. For most evaluation measures, the relationship appears to be linear except at the extremes.","For short summaries, sentences are more effective than paragraphs. This is expected; the granularity of paragraphs makes it tough to fit in entire good paragraphs. However, the reverse seems to be true for longer summaries, at least for us at our current level of summarization expertise. The paragraphs tend to include related sentences that individually do not seem to use the particular vocabulary our matching algorithms desire. This suggests that work on coreference becomes particularly crucial when working with sentence based summaries."]},{"title":"Multi-Document Summarization.","paragraphs":["Our current work includes extending context-dependent summarization techniques for use in multi-document, rather than single-document, summarization.

This is especially a problem when users search text collections that have been created from several distinct sources: a newswire source may have several reports of the same incident, each of which may vary insignificantly.

A line connects two paragraphs if their similarity is above a predefined threshold.","Exact duplicate documents are very easy to detect by any number of techniques. Documents for which the basic content is exactly the same, but differ in document meta-data like Message ID or Time of Message, are also easy to detect by several techniques. We propose to compute a cosine similarity function between all retrieved documents. Pairs of documents with a similarity of 1.0 will be identical as far as indexable content terms.","The interesting research question is how to examine document pairs that are obviously highly related, but do not contain exactly the same terms or vocabulary as each other. For this, document-document maps are constructed between all retrieved documents which are of sufficient similarity to each other. These maps (see Figure 5) show a link between paragraphs of one document and paragraphs of the other if the similarity between the paragraphs is sufficiently strong. If all of the paragraphs of a document are strongly linked to paragraphs of a second document, then the content of the first document may be subsumed by the content of the second document. If there are unlinked paragraphs of a document, then those paragraphs contain new material that should be emphasized when the document is shown to the user. The structure of the document maps is an additional important feature to be used to indicate the type of relationship between the documents: is one document an expansion of another, or are they equivalent paraphrases of each other, or is one a summary document that includes the common topic as well as other topics. All of this information can be used to decide which document to initially show the user.","Document-document maps can be created presently within the Smart system, though they have not been used in the past for detection of duplicate content [2, 17, 18]. Figure 5 gives such a document-document map between two newswire reports, one a fuller version of the other."]},{"title":"7 SUMMARY","paragraphs":["In summary, we have developed supporting technology for improving end-user efficiency of information retrieval (IR) systems.

The proposed statistical approaches extend existing methods in IR by pertbrming statistical computations within the context of another query or document. The proposed linguistic approaches build on existing work in information extraction and rely on a new technique for trainable partial parsing. The goal of the integrated approach is to identify selected relationships among important terms in a query or text and use the extracted relationships: (1) to discard or reorder retrieved texts, (2) to locate redundant information, and (3) to generate coherent query-dependent summaries. We believe that the integrated approach offers an innovative and promising solution to problems in end-user efficiency for a number of reasons:","• Unlike previous attempts to combine natural language understanding and information retrieval, our approach always performs linguistic analysis relative to another document or query.","• End-user effectiveness will not be significantly compromised in the face of errors by the Smart/Empire system.","• The partial parser is a trainable system that can be tuned to recognize those linguistic relationships that are most important for the larger IR task.","In addition, we have developed TRUESmart, a Toolbox for Research in User Efficiency. TRUESmart is a set of tools and data supporting researchers in the development of methods for improving user efficiency for state-of-the-art information retrieval systems. In addition, TRUESmart includes a simple graphical user interface that aids system evaluation and analysis by highlighting important term relationships identified by the underlying statistical and linguistic language processing algorithms. To date, we have used TRUESmart to integrate and evaluate system components in high-precision retrieval and context-dependent summarization.","In conclusion, we believe that our statistical-linguistic approach to automated text retrieval has shown promising results and has simultaneously addressed four important goals for the TIPSTER program -- the need for increased accuracy in detection systems, increased portability and applicability of extraction systems, better summarization of free text, and increased communication across detection and extraction systems."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Steven.
