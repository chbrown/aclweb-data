However, it is only recently that researchers have begun to consider adjusting the score fusion method to the user's topic and initial results. This study explores the value of fusing multiple retrieval systems' scores in a manner that adjusts to: the semantic and syntactic features of the user's natural language query, the various systems' biases toward long or short documents, and the extent to which the scores produced by the multiple systems are statistically independent."]},{"title":"PREVIOUS WORK","paragraphs":["The ability to improve retrieval performance by using multiple retrieval systems has been documented extensively (e.g,, [1], [31, [41). It is only recently, however, that researchers have turned their attention to the possibility of adjusting the manner in which results are combined to the specific query at hand. Researchers have reported success in using initial relevance judgments to adjust the way in which results are combined [3], and have also reported success in using the joint distribution of relevance scores from multiple marchers (among other things) to predict when to combine the results of multiple systems [6]. The purpose of the current research is to explore the use of the joint distribution of relevance scores, semantic and syntactic features of queries. and the length of retrieved documents to predict how to combine the results of several retrieval systems."]},{"title":"DEFINITIONS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS","paragraphs":["We define a q,ery as a natural language expression of a user's need. For sonic query and some collection of documents, it is possible for a human to attribute the relevance of the document to the query. A retrieral system is a machine that accepts a query and full texts of documents, and produces, for each document, a relevance score for the query-document pair. A measure of the effectiveness of a retrieval system for a query and a collection is precision, the proportion of the N documents with the highest relevance scores that are relevant (in our study, N is 5, 10, or 30).","Using multiple retrieval systems produces multiple retrieval scores for a query-document pair. A fitsion fimction accepts these scores as its inputs, and produces a single relevance score as its output for the query-document pair. A staticfiisionfimction has only the relevance scores for a single query-document pair as its inputs. A dynamic filsion fimction can have more inputs.","We are concerned with the following two questions: If we allow each query its own static fusion function, can we achieve higher precision than if we force all queries to have the same static fusion function?",". If we can achieve higher precision by allowing each query its own static fusion function, then what inputs or tkmtures would enable us to construct a dynamic fusion function that adjusts to the query, the documents retrieved by the retrieval systems, and the distribution of scores produced by the retrieval systems'?"]},{"title":"THE","paragraphs":["DATA"]},{"title":"Queries, Documents, and Relevance Judgments","paragraphs":["We used 247 queries, including TREC I-6 training queries, and queries developed bv business analysts for TcxtWisc's internal use.

For instance, by using query-specific static fusion functions, we achieved precision at 5 of .5960, compared to .3840 when applying the same static fusion function to all queries. However, this comparison is overly optimistic, since it allows query-specific fusion functions to be trained and evaluated on exactly the same data, while forcing the overall fusion function to be trained on a large set of data, but then evaluated on a small subset of that data. To provide a more pessimistic comparison, we partitioned the data for our 50 queries into equallysized training and test sets. We trained each query-specific fusion function on the query's training data, and evaluated it on the test data. (Although our goal is to improve retrospective retrieval, this arrangement resembles the TREC routing scenario.) Table 3 shows a considerably weaker, but still appreciable improvement due to using query-specific fusion functions. For instance, we achieved precision at 5 of .4160 when allowing each query its own static fusion function, compared to .3400 when forcing all queries to use the same function. dimensions are the relevance scores from the set of matchers. We constructed a fused score for a test document by summing the relevance judgments for the test document's K nearest training documents (where K was 5, 10, 15 or 20). We tried weighting the sums by an inverse function of the distance between the test document and the training document. We also tried scaling the dimensions' contribution to the distance metric with a weight reflecting the corresponding matcher's precision.","To our surprise, none of these experiments produced K-NN-based fusion functions that performed consistently better than a linear fusion function. On closer inspection, it appears that at least part of the poor performance of K-NN as a fusion function can be attributed to instances in which the probability distribution of relevance for the training documents for the query did not resemble the probability distribution of relevance for all the documents in the query. In this sort of situation, the linear model appears to be more robust than K-NN. It may be that a more careful selection of the training set would result in more reasonable performance from K-NN-based fusion functions.","For the linear fusion function, we found the optimal vector of coefficients by selecting the coefficients that produce the greatest precision at 5","Table 3.","Precision of Five Systems, Overall Static Fusion Functions,","and Query-Specific Fusion Functions,","When Training and Testing on Different Data for Each Query","Single Retrieval Systems Static Fusion Functions Single Overall","(vs. FB) .1187 .1313 Prec. at FB SFC PROB NG3 LSI 5 .3360 .0040 .1960 .1920 .1600 .3400(+01%) .4160 (+22%) 10 .2680 .0100 .1680 .1600 .1340 .3120(+16%) .3620(+16%) 30 .1967 .0140 Query-Speci tic (vs. overall) .1253 .2230 (+13%) .2533 (+34%)","We constrained our fusion functions to be weighted linear combinations of the five retrieval scores lk)r a query-document pair.

DISCUSSION","So far, our results suggest that, for our choice of retrieval systems, there is an opportunity to improve retrieval performance by using dynamic fusion functions instead of using a single static fusion function ['or all queries. One possible qualification to these results is that limiting ourselves to a linear form for the static fusion models may result in artificially low baseline retrieval for the single overall static function. The volatility of the K-NN technique in the context of our data made it difficult to say whether or not a non-linear form for the fusion model is necessary.","Our preferred implementation of the mixture expert in the dynamic fusion function is a multilayer feedforward neural network, with output nodes corresponding to the linear weights of the linear fusion function. However, given that our real goal is to maximize precision, rather than to replicate the weights exactly, a straightforward application of backpropogation to train such a network to replicate the target weights is inappropriate. The optimal linear weights are likely to be on \"plateaus\" with respect to precision, with little change in precision in response to large changes in linear weights. We are currently investigating alternative ways of training the mixture expert in the dynamic fusion model."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["[ I 1 Bartell, B., Cottrell, G.W., Belew, R.K.
