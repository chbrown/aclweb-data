It is regarded to be a Pluricentric language with a number of interacting centres and language varieties (Thompson, 1992). Each of these national varieties has their own characteristics in terms of phonetics, lexicon and syntax. Computational applications can benefit from identifying the correct variety of Spanish texts when undertaking tasks such as Machine Translation or Information Extraction, as they are able to handle lexical, orthographic and syntactic variation more accurately. The task is modelled as a classification problem with very similar methods to those applied to general TALN-RÉCITAL 2013, 17-21 Juin, Les Sables d’Olonne 580 c⃝ ATALA purpose language identification (Dunning, 1994). To the best of our knowledge, very few attempts have been made to address the problem of identifying language varieties as evidenced in 2.1. In this work we try to classify texts retrieved from newspapers published in 2008 from four different Spanish speaking countries : Spain, Argentina, Mexico and Peru. Moreover, we propose the use of new features, not limited to the classical word and character n-grams. We experimented features based on POS distribution and morphosyntactic information. The use of knowledge-rich features is not an attempt to outperform word and character n-gram-based methods, but an attempt to examine the extent to which these varieties differ in terms of grammar."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Language identification is the task of automatically identifying the language contained in a given document. State-of-the-art methods apply n-gram language models at the character and sometimes word-level with results usually above 95% accuracy. This level of success is very common when dealing with languages which are typologically not closely related. This is however not the case of language varieties in which the distinction is based on very subtle differences that algorithms can be trained to recognize. One of the first general purpose language identification approaches was the work of Ingle (1980). Ingle applied Zipf’s law distribution to order the frequency of stop words in a text and used this information for language identification. Dunning (1994) introduced the use of character n-grams and statistics for language identification. In this study, the likelihood of n-grams was calculated using Markov models and this was used as the most informative feature for identification. Other studies applying n-gram language models for language identification include Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) implemented as TextCat 1",", Grefenstette (1995), and Vojtek and Belikova (2007). In the recent years, a number of language identification methods were developed for internet data such as Martins and Silva (2005) and Rehurek and Kolkus (2009). The most recent general purpose language identification method to our knowledge is the one published by Lui and Baldwin (2012). Their software, called langid.py, has language models for 97 languages, using various data sources. The method achieved results of up to 94.7% accuracy, thus outperforming similar tools. All models described in this section neglect language varieties. Pluricentric languages, such as the case of Spanish, are represented by a unique class."]},{"title":"2.1 Models for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects","paragraphs":["The identification of closely related languages is one of the bottlenecks of most n-gram-based models and there are only a few studies published about it.

To collect comparable samples, we retrieved texts published in the same year from local newspapers regarded to have similar register, as follows : Country Newspaper Year Argentina La Nación 2008 Mexico El Universal 2008 Peru El Comércio 2008 Spain El Mundo 2008 TABLE 1 – Corpora Each sub-corpus contains a set of 1,000 documents randomly sampled to avoid bias towards a given topic or genre. These sub-corpora were divided in training and test settings of 500 documents each. Following the compilation of the corpora, four groups of features were selected. The list of features used and the aspect of language that these features aim to analyse are presented next : – Character n-grams (2 to 5) : orthography and lexicon – Word uni-grams : lexicon – Word bi-grams : lexicon and syntax – POS and morphological features : morphology and syntax The first three groups of features (knowledge-poor features) are standard in language identification and they were widely used in previous approaches. The fourth group of features (knowledge-rich features) is to our knowledge new and it consists of the use of POS and morphological feature annotation. The POS tags and morphological information were used as one unit in form of a compound tags (e.g. N-msc-sg or V-inf).

Firstly, from an NLP perspective, these new features model a different aspect of language that cannot be addressed by neither character nor word n-grams. Secondly, because the average results obtained and the corresponding most informative features might be an important resource for contrastive linguistics providing an indication of how varieties converge and diverge. The classification method is based on n-gram language models and document log-likelihood estimation (Dunning, 1993) as described in Zampieri and Gebre (2012). Its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in language identification which focus on similar languages. It was tested on Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian documents 3","achieving 91.0% accuracy. Models described in Ljubešić et al. (2007) achieved 90.3% and 95.7% accuracy using the same dataset.

For each cluster, two p-values (between 0 and 1) are calculated via multiscale bootstrap resampling. These values indicate how strong the cluster is supported by data. The two p-values are : the AU (Approximately Unbiased), in red, computed by multiscale bootstrap resampling and BP (Bootstrap Probability) in green, computed by normal bootstrap resampling. The graphic shows the difference between the performance of knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich features, arranging each in a different cluster 1. FIGURE 1 – Cluster Dendogram with AU/BP Values The analysis grouped the two word-based feature groups in the same cluster, as they performed on average better than the character-based methods. Another interesting point of the analysis is that the results of character 4- and 5-grams are grouped in the same cluster due to an TALN-RÉCITAL 2013, 17-21 Juin, Les Sables d’Olonne 585 c⃝ ATALA increase in performance when a larger amount of characters are taken into account. Character 4- and 5-grams features are closer to the lexical level taking whole words into account, which suggests that the model is more effective when using complete lexical items as features. As stated before, the morphological features were not expected to outperform the knowledge-poor models, but to be used to investigate differences in grammar. An interesting outcome of these experiments is the direct relationship between the algorithm’s performance using knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich features. One clear example is the classification of Argentina and Spain which obtained the worst results with characters and words as well as when using POS and morphology : 0.843 and 0.666 accuracy respectively. Another example is Argentina and Mexico which achieved the best results using characters and words, 0.999 accuracy and the second best results with POS tags, 0.801 accuracy. For these reasons, the results presented here are an encouraging perspective for further studies. It is possible to use the outcome of the classification as a source of information for contrastive linguistics to provide quantitative overview on how these varieties converge and diverge in terms of grammar and lexicon. Linguistic analysis may be carried out using the most informative features in classification."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Perspectives","paragraphs":["We presented a first attempt to identify a set of four Spanish varieties in written texts with f-measure results ranging from 0.813 to 0.876. As expected, the binary classification settings have achieved significantly better results in comparison to the 4-class classification setting. The algorithm was able to distinguish between texts from Argentina and Mexico with an average accuracy of 0.999. As previously discussed, the integration of these language models in real-world NLP applications, should improve results in a number of NLP tasks. The experiments used not only the classical character and word n-gram models but also morphosyntactic information combined with POS. This is to our knowledge a new contribution of our work to this kind of experiments. The classification with knowledge-rich features achieved up to 0.831 accuracy for Mexican and Peninsular Spanish. We observed a direct relationship between the performance of knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich features, binary settings which obtained good performance using characters and words also present good results using morphosyntactic information. This aspect should be better explored in future work through a careful linguistic analysis. As future perspectives, first we wish to compare the performance of our method with general purpose language identification methods such as langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012). Second, we are replicating our experiments to a set of French varieties. Finally, we would like to experiment the combination of POS and word n-grams to investigate if performance increases."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their careful feedback.
