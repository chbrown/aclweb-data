Yet, many people share the same name with for example 157630 individuals in the UK sharing the most common name ‘David Jones’ (UK statistics cited by Ash 2006). Consequently identifying web pages on specific individuals is a significant problem that will grow as everyone acquires a web presence.","There are several proposed approaches to identifying which individuals correspond to which web pages. For example, Bollegala et al. (2007) propose augmenting queries in the style of relevance feedback (Salton and Buckley 1990), Kalashnikov (2007) treat Web Person Search (WePS) as a disambiguation problem whose objective is to distinguish individuals, whilst Wan et al. (2005) see WePS as a clustering problem.","WePS has both similarities and differences to word sense disambiguation (WSD). Both seek to classify instances of usage, but in WSD the sense inventory is fixed. WSD then is more amenable to a classification solution where a system can be effectively trained using learning algorithms. In WePS we do not know from the outset how many individuals our pages correspond to. Consequently we took the view that WePS is better seen as a clustering rather than a classification problem. 1.1 Ambiguity Ambiguity is a common feature of WePS and WSD. There are multiple types of ambiguity in the relation between person names and entities that confound overly simple approaches. Firstly, note that some first names are also last names (Les Paul, Michael Howard), and that some last names also occur as given names (Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, Martin Luther King). Consequently, an overly simple name parser will easily be confused. Secondly many last names are also place names (Jack London, William Manchester). Thus, if a last name is not found in the names database, but is found in the gazetteer, a name can be confused with a location. Finally, we come to toponym ambiguity, where the name of a place may correspond to several locations. (For example, there are thirteen places called Manchester, multiple Londons, Washingtons etc.) Resolving toponyms is a re-search problem itself (Leidner, 2004). 1.2 Statistics Statistics are a further relation between WePS and WSD. We expect Zipf’s law (e.g. Adamic and Huberman 2002) to apply to the relation between 402 web pages and individuals, meaning that relative frequency and rank form a harmonic series. In other words some people will be associated with many pages and increasingly more will be linked to fewer. This has a strong link to disambiguation, where an inaccurate algorithm may give inferior performance to the strategy of always selecting the most frequent sense.","Now if we consider the types of data that distinguish individuals, we might find colleagues, friends, and family mentioned in web pages, in addition to locations, dates, and topics of interest. Of these, names are particularly useful, and we define co-present names as names found in a web page in addition to the name for which we are searching.","Names are statistically useful, even though many people share the same name. For example there are 7640 individuals in the UK (for example) that share the most popular female name “Margaret Smith”. Given the population of the UK is approximately 60 million, the probability of even the most common female name in the UK occurring randomly is 1.27+10-4 (of course not all the individuals have web pages).","Now, Semeval WePS pages (Artiles 2007) have been retrieved in response to a search for one name. Often such web pages will contain addi-tional names. The probability that a web page will contain two names corresponding to two different individuals is quite low (~ca 7x10-8). Consequently co-present names form indicators of an individual’s identity. These give accurate seed points, which are critical to the success of many clustering algorithms such as k-means (Jain et al. 1999) 1.3 Lexical Chain Text Similarity Not all WePS pages contain multiple names, or even content in any form. Consequently we need to distinguish between pages that are similar in meaning to a page already in a seed cluster, those that refer to separate entities, and those to be discarded","This was done by comparing the conceptual similarity of the WePS pages using Roget’s thesaurus as the conceptual inventory. The approach was described in Ellman (2000), where lexical chains are identified from each document using Roget's thesaurus. These chains are then unrolled to yield an attribute value vector of concepts where the values are given by repetition, type of thesaural relation found, and textual cohesion. Thus, we are not simply indexing by thesaural categories.","Vectors corresponding to different documents can be compared to give a measure of conceptual similarity. Roget’s thesaurus typically contains one thousand sense entries divided by part of speech usage, giving a total of 6400 entries. Such vectors may be compared using many algorithms, although a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in Ellman (2000). 1.4 One Sense Per Discourse UNN-WePS was based on a deliberate strategy that the success of an active disambiguation method needed to exceed its overall error rate in order to improve baseline performance. As such, simple methods that improved overall success modestly were preferred to complex ones that did not. Consequently, to reduce the search space, we used the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic (Gale et al. 1992). This assumes that one web page would not refer to two different individuals that share a name."]},{"title":"2 System Description","paragraphs":["UNN-WePS was made up of three components,","comprising modules to: 1. Create seed clusters that associated files","with person names other than those being","searched for.","2. Match similarity of unallocated documents to micro clusters using lexical chains derived from Roget’s thesaurus.","3. Identify entities using single link agglomerative clustering algorithm.","In detail, a part of speech tagger (Coburn et al. 2007) was used to identify sequences of proper nouns. Person names were identified from these sequences using the following simple names ‘grammar’ coupled with data from the US Census (1990).","","Name = [Title*","][Initials | 1st","name]+","[2nd","name]+"," Figure 1: Regular Expression Name Syntax"," We also used a gazetteer to forms seed clusters","using data from the World Gazetteer (2007). This","did not form part of the submitted system.  403 In the second step, conceptual similarity was determined using the method and tool described in Ellman (2000). Documents not allocated to seed clusters, were compared for conceptual similarity to all other documents. If similar to a document in a seed cluster, the unallocated document was in-serted into the seed cluster. If neither document nor one to which it was similar too were in a seed cluster, they were formed into a new seed cluster. Finally if document has 'meaningful' content, but is not conceptually similar to any other it is stored in a singleton seed cluster otherwise, it is discarded.","In the final step, seed clusters were sorted by size and merged using a single link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to identify entities (Jain et al. 1999). The use of a single link means that a document can only be associated with one entity, which conforms to the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic.","Further details of the UNN-WePS algorithm are given in figure 2 below.

Firstly this contains multiple individuals sharing the same name violating the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic. Secondly genealogical data includes birth and death information which was outside the scope of UNN-WePS. Further-more, the large number of names confounds the statistical utility of co-present names."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have described a system, UNN-WePS that disambiguates individuals in web pages as required for Semeval task 13 (Artiles et al. 2007).","UNN-WePS was composed of three modules. The first formed seed clusters based on names present in web pages other than the individual for whom we are searching. The second used a lexical Figure 2: UNN-WePS Algorithm 404 chain based similarity measure to associates remaining files with clusters, whilst the third joined the clusters to identify identities using a single link hierarchical algorithm.","UNN-WePS performed surprisingly well considering the simplicity of its basic seeding algorithm. The use however of the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic was flawed. Names do re-occur across generations in families.","Genealogy is a popular Internet pastime, and web pages containing genealogy data frequently refer to multiple individuals that share a name at different time periods. As UNN-WePS did not account for time, this could not be detected. Further-more, the large number of names in on-line genealogical data does lead to spurious associations.","As WePS was time limited, several extensions and refinements were envisaged, but not executed. Firstly, as described, the world gazetteer (2007) did not lead to performance improvements. We speculate therefore the disambiguation effect from using place names was exceeded by the ambiguity introduced by using them blindly. We note especially the inference between unidentified names (or street names, or building names) being interpreted as place data.","A further system deficiency was the lack of recognition of date data. This is essential to differentiate between identically named individuals in genealogical data.","Finally, we are currently experimenting with different clustering algorithms using the CLUTO toolkit (Karypis 2002) to improve on UNN-WePS baseline performance."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Adamic L.A. and Huberman B.A., 2002 Zipf's law and the Internet, Glottometrics 3, 2002, 143-150","Artiles, J., Gonzalo, J. and Sekine, S.
