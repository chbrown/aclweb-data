The system is based on a combination of k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, with each classifier learning from a distinct set of features: local features (syntactic, collocations features), topical features (bag-of-words, domain information) and latent features learned from a reduced space using Singular Value Decomposition."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Our group (UBC-ALM) participated in the lexical sample and all-words WSD subtasks of SemEval-2007 task 17. We applied a combination of different k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. Each classifier manages different information sources (features), making the combination a powerful solution. This algorithm was previously tested on the datasets from previous editions of Senseval (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2006). Before submission, the performance of the system was tested on the SemEval lexical sample training data. For learning we use a rich set of features, including latent features obtained from a reduced space using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).","This paper is organized as follows. The learning features are presented in section 2, and the learning algorithm and the combinations of single k-NNs are given in section 3. Section 4 focuses on the tuning experiments. Finally, section 5 summarizes the official results and some conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Feature set","paragraphs":["We relied on an extensive set of features of different types, obtained by means of different tools and resources. We defined two main groups: the original features extracted directly from the text, and the SVD features obtained after applying SVD decomposition and projecting the original features into the new semantic space (Agirre et al., 2005). 2.1 Original features Local collocations: bigrams and trigrams formed with the words around the target. These features are constituted by lemmas, word-forms, or PoS tags1",". Other local features are those formed with the previous/posterior lemma/word-form in the context.","Syntactic dependencies: syntactic dependencies were extracted using heuristic patterns, and regular expressions defined with the PoS tags around the target2",". The following relations were used: object, subject, noun-modifier, preposition, and sibling.","Bag-of-words features: we extract the lemmas of the content words in the whole context, and in a ±4-word window around the target. We also obtain salient bigrams in the context, with the methods and the software described in (Pedersen, 2001).","Domain features: The WordNet Domains resource was used to identify the most relevant domains in the context. Following the relevance for-mula presented in (Magnini and Cavagliá, 2000), we defined 2 feature types: (1) the most relevant domain, and (2) a list of domains above a predefined threshold3",".","1","The PoS tagging was performed with the fnTBL toolkit (Ngai and Florian, 2001).","2","This software was kindly provided by David Yarowsky’s group, from Johns Hopkins University.","3","The software to obtain the relevant domains was kindly provided by Gerard Escudero’s group, from Universitat Politec-342 2.2 SVD features Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is an interest-ing solution to the sparse data problem. This technique reduces the dimensions of the vectorial space finding correlations and collapsing features. It also gives the chance to use unlabeled data as an additional source of correlations.","M ∋ Rm×n",", a matrix of features-by-document is built from the training corpus and decomposed into three matrices, as shown in Eq.

Each occurrence or instance is represented by the features found in the context (fi). Given an occurrence of a word, the ML method below returns a nica de Catalunya weight for each sense (weight(sk)). The sense with maximum weight will be selected.","We use a set of combination of the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) to tag the target words in both the lexical sample and all-words tasks. 3.1 k-Nearest Neighbor k-NN is a memory-based learning method, where the neighbors are the k most similar contexts, represented by feature vectors (⃗ci), of the test vector ( ⃗f ). The similarity among instances is measured by the cosine of their vectors. The test instance is labeled with the sense obtaining the maximum sum of the weighted votes of the k most similar contexts. The vote is weighted depending on its (neighbor) position in the ordered rank, with the closest being first. Eq. (2) formalizes k-NN, where Ci corresponds to the sense label of the i-th closest neighbor.","arg max Sj = k∑ i=1 { 1 i if Ci = Sj 0 otherwise (2) 3.2 k-NN combinations and feature splits As seen in section 2 we use a variety of heterogeneous sets of features. Our previous experience has shown that splitting the problem up into more coherent spaces, training different classifiers in each feature space, and then combining them into a single classifier is a good way to improve the results (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2006). Depending on the feature type (original features or features extracted from SVD projection) we split different sets of feature spaces. In total we tried 10 features spaces.","For the original features: • all feats: Extracted all original features. • all notdom: All original features except do-","main features. • local: All the original features except domain","and bag-of-words features. • topic: The sum of bag-of-words and domain","features. • bow: Bag-of-word features. • dom: Domain features. 343 Combination accuracy all feats+topic+local+SVD-OMT[all feats]+SVD-OMT[topic]+SVD-OMT[local] 88.8 all feats+all notdom+topic+local+SVD-SMA+SVD-OMT[all feats]+SVD-OMT[topic]+SVD-OMT[local] 88.7 all feats+topic+local+SVD-SMA+SVD-OMT[all feats]+SVD-OMT[topic]+SVD-OMT[local] 88.5 all notdom+topic+local+SVD-SMA+SVD-OMT[all feats]+SVD-OMT[topic]+SVD-OMT[local] 88.5 all feats+all notdom+topic+local 88.4 all notdom+local+SVD-SMA 88.3 all feats+all notdom+local+SVD-SMA 88.2 all notdom+topic+local 88.1 all feats+topic+local 88.1 word-by-word optimization 89.5 Table 1: Result for the best k-NN combinations in 3 fold cross-validation SemEval lexical sample.

In this work, we exploited the fact that a k-NN classifier can be seen as k points casting each one vote. The votes are weigthed by the inverse ratio of its position in the rank (k − ri + 1)/k, where ri is the rank. Each of the k-NN classifiers is trained on a different feature space and then combined."]},{"title":"4 Experiments on training data","paragraphs":["We optimized and tuned the system differently for each kind of tasks. We will examine each in turn. 4.1 Optimization for the lexical sample task For the lexical sample task we only use the training data provided. We tuned the classifiers using 3 fold cross-validation on the SemEval lexical sample training data. We tried to optimize several parameters: number of neighbors, SVD dimensions and best combination of the single k-NNs. We set k as one of 1, 3, 5 and 7, and the SVD dimension (d) as one of 50, 100, 200 and 300. We also fixed the best combination. This is the optimization procedure we followed:","1. For each single classifier and feature set (see section 2), check each parameter combination.","2. Fix the parameters for each single classifier. In our case, k = 5 and k = 7 had similar results, so we postponed the decision. d = 200 was the best dimension for all classifiers, except SVD-OMT[topic] which was d = 50.","3. For the best parameter settings (k = 5; k = 7 and d = 200; d = 50 when SVD-OMT[topic]) make a priori meaningful combinations (due to CPU requirements, not all combination were feasible).","4. Choose the x best combination overall, and optimize word by word among these combination. We set x = 8 for this work, k was fixed in 5, and d = 200 (except with SVD-OMT[topic] which was d = 50).","Table 1 shows the best results for 3 fold cross-validation in SemEval lexical sample training corpus. The figures show that optimizing each word the performance increases 0.7 percentage points over the best combination. 4.2 Optimization for the all-words task To train the classifiers for the all-words task we just used Semcor (Miller et al., 1993). In (Agirre et al., 2006) we already tested our approach on the Senseval-3 all-words task. The best performance for the Senseval-3 all-words task was obtained with k = 5 and d = 200, but we decided to to perform further experiments to search for the best combination. We tested the performance of the combination of single k-NN training on Semcor and testing both on the Senseval-3 all-words data (cf. Table 2) and on the training data from SemEval-2007 lexical sample (cf. Table 3).","Note that tables 2 and 3 show contradictory results.

On the lexical sample evaluation our system is 2.6 lower than the cross-validation evaluation. This can be a sign of a slight overfitting on the training data. All in all we ranked second over 13 systems.","Our all-words system did not perform so well. Our system is around 4.7 points below the winning system, ranking 5th from a total of 14, and 3 points above the baseline given by the organizers. This is a disappointing result when compared to our previous work on Senseval-3 all-words where we were able to beat the best official results (Agirre et al., 2006). Note that the test set was rather small, with 465 occurrences only, which might indicate that the performance differences are not statistically significant. We plan to further investigate the reasons for our results."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We wish to thank to David Martı́nez for helping us extracting learning features.
