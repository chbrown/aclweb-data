The system is based on two supervised machine learning algorithms: Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines. These algorithms were trained on a corpus created from SemCor, Senseval 2 and 3 all words and lexical sample corpora and Open Mind Word Expert 1.0 corpus. We used topical, syntactic and semantic features. Some semantic features were created using WordNet glosses with semantic relations tagged manually and automatically as part of eXtended WordNet project. We also tried to create more training instances from the disambiguated WordNet glosses found in XWN project (XWN, 2003). For words for which we could not build a sense classifier, we used First Sense in WordNet as a back-off strategy in order to have coverage of 100%. The precision and recall of the overall system is 81.446% placing it in the top 5 systems."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The performance of a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system using a finite set of senses depends greatly on the definition of the word senses. Fine grained senses are hard to distinguish while coarse grained senses tend to be more clear. Word Sense Disambiguation is not a final goal, but it is an in-termediary step used in other Natural Processing applications like detection of Semantic Relations, Information Retrieval or Machine Translation. Word Sense Disambiguation is not useful if it is not performed with high accuracy (Sanderson, 1994). A coarse grained set of sense gives the opportunity to make more precise sense distinction and to make a Word Sense Disambiguation system more useful to other tasks.","Our goal at SemEval 2007 was to measure the performance of known supervised machine learning algorithm using coarse grained senses. The idea of using supervised machine learning for WSD is not new and was used for example in (Ng and Lee, 1996). We made experiments with two supervised methods: Maximum Entropy (ME) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These supervised algorithms were used with topical, syntactic and semantic features. We trained a classifier for each word using both supervised algorithms. New features were added in 3 incremental steps. After an initial set of experiments the algorithm performance was enhanced using a greedy feature selection algorithm similar to one in (Mihalcea, 2002). In order to increase the number of training instances, we tried to use the disambiguated WordNet glosses from XWN project (XWN, 2003). Combining other corpora with disambiguated glosses from XWN did not provide any improvement so we used XWN as a fall back strategy for 70 words that did not have any training examples in other corpora but XWN.","Section 2 describes the supervised methods used by our WSD system, the pre-processing module and the set of features. Section 3 presents the experiments we performed and their results. Section 4 draws the conclusions. 223"]},{"title":"2 System Description","paragraphs":["The system contains a preprocessing module used before computing the values of the features needed by the machine learning classifiers.

The classifier was adapted to accept symbolic features for classification tasks in Natural Language Processing.","For training SVM classifiers we used LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001). Each symbolic feature can have a single value from a finite set of values or can be assigned a subset of values from the set of all possible values. For each value we created a mapping between the feature value and a dimension in the N-dimensional classificationspace and we assigned the number 1.0 to that dimension if the feature had the corresponding value or 0.0 otherwise.","We firstperformed experiments with our existing set of features used at Senseval 3 All Words task. We call this set ",". Then we made three incremental changes to improve the performance.","The initial set contains the following features: current word form (CRT WORD) and part of speech (CRT POS), contextual features (CTX WORD) in a window (-3,3) words, collocations in a window of (-3,3) words (COL WORD), keywords (KEY-WORDS) and bigrams (BIGRAMS) in a window of (-3,3) sentences, verb mode (VERB MODE) which can take 4 values: ACTIVE, INFINITIVE, PAST, GERUND, verb voice (VERB VOICE) which can take 2 values ACTIVE, PASSIVE, the parent of the current verb in the parse tree (CRT PARENT) (ex: VP, NP), the firstancestor that is not VP in the parse tree (RAND PARENT) (like S, NP, PP, SBAR) and a boolean flag indicating if the current verb belongs to the main clause or not (MAIN CLAUSE).","We added new features to the initial set.

We used filesfrom XWN project (XWN, 2003) containing WordNet 2.0 glosses that were sense disambiguated and tagged with semantic relations both manually and automatically. For each word to be disambiguated we created a signature consisting of the set of words that are linked with a semantic relation of THEME or AGENT in all WordNet glosses. For every word in this set we created a feature showing if that word appears in the current sentence containing the target word.","Then we added a new feature consisting of all the named entities in a window of (-5,5) sentences around the target word.

Each set of experiments together with the finalsubmission is described in detail below. 3.1 Experiments with different feature sets Initially we made experiments with the set of features used at Senseval 3 All Words task. For training the ME and SVM classifiers, we used a combined corpus made from SemCor, Senseval 3 All Words corpus, Senseval 3 Lexical Sample testing and training corpora and Senseval 2 Lexical sample training corpus. For testing we used Senseval 2 Lexical Sample corpus. We made 3 experiments for the first three feature sets","  ,","  ,"," ",". Both algorithms attempted to disambiguate all the words (coverage=100%) so the precision is equal with recall. The precision of each algorithm on each feature set is presented in table 2.","Algorithm","","","","ME 76.03% 75.86% 76.03% 77.56%","SVM 73.30% 71.36% 71.46% 71.90% Table 2: The precision of ME and SVM classifiers using 4 sets of features.","After the first3 experiments we noticed that both ME and SVM classifiers had good results using the firstset of features  .

This led us to the idea that not all the features are useful for all words. So we created a greedy feature selection algorithm based on the performance of the SVM classifier (Mihalcea, 2002). The feature selection algorithm starts with an empty set of features ",", and iteratively adds one feature from the set of unused features",". Initially the set ","contains all the features. The algorithm iterates as long as the overall performance increase. At each step the algorithm adds tentatively one feature from the set","to the existing feature list ","and measures the performance of the classifier on a 10 fold cross validation on the training corpus. The feature providing the greatest increase in performance is finally added to ","and removed from .","The feature selection algorithm turned out to be very slow, so we could not use it to train all the words. Therefore we used it to train only the words from Senseval 2 Lexical Sample task and then we computed a global set of features by selecting the first20 features that were selected the most (at least 5 times). This list of features was named","   . Table 2 that SVM classifier with","  did not get a better performance than","  ","while ME surprisingly did get 1.53% increase in performance. Given the higher precision of ME classifier, it was selected for creat-ing the submission file. 225","3.2 Experiments using disambiguated glosses from XWN project The ME classifierworks well for words with enough training examples. However we found many words for which the number of training examples was too small. We tried to increase the number of training examples using the disambiguated WordNet glosses from XWN project. Not all the senses in the disambiguated glosses were assigned manually and the text of the glosses is different than normal running text. However we were curious if we could improve the overall performance by adding more training examples. We made 3 experiments showed in table 3. For all three experiments we used Senseval 2 English All Words corpus for testing. On the firstexperiment we used SemCor for training, on the second we used disambiguated glosses from XWN project and on the third we used both. XWN did not bring an improvement to the overall precision, so we decided to use XWN as a fall back strategy only for 70 words that did not have training examples is other corpora. 3.3 Final Submission For final submission we used trained ME models using feature set  ","for 852 words, representing 1715 instances using SemCor, Senseval 2 and 3 English All Words and Lexical Sample testing and training and OMWE 1.0.

For the rest of 484 words for which we could not findtraining examples we used the First Sense in WordNet strategy.
