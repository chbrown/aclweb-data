Our second entry, for Task 14: Affective Text, is a supervised system that annotates headlines using a predefined list of emotions. This system uses synonym expansion and matches lemmatized unigrams in the test headlines against a corpus of hand-annotated headlines."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper describes our two entries in SemEval-2007. The first entry, a supervised system used in the Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample task (Task 5), is an extension of the system described in (Wicentowski et al., 2004). We implement five different classifiers: a Naı̈ve Bayes classifier, a decision list classifier, two different nearest neighbor cosine classifiers, and a classifier based on Latent Semantic Analysis. Section 2.2 describes each of the individual classifiers, Section 2.3 describes our classifier combination system, and Section 2.4 presents our results.","The second entry, a supervised system used in the Affective Text task (Task 14), uses a corpus of headlines hand-annotated by non-experts. It also uses an online thesaurus to match synonyms and antonyms of the sense labels (Thesaurus.com, 2007). Section 3.1 describes the creation of the annotated training corpus, Section 3.2 describes our method for assigning scores to the headlines, and Section 3.3 presents our results."]},{"title":"2 Task 5: Multilingual Chinese-English LS","paragraphs":["This task presents a single Chinese word in context which must be disambiguated. Rather than asking participants to provide a sense label corresponding to a pre-defined sense inventory, the goal here is to label each ambiguous word with its correct English translation. Since the task is quite similar to more traditional lexical sample tasks, we extend an approach used successfully in multiple Senseval-3 lexical sample tasks (Wicentowski et al., 2004). 2.1 Features Each of our classifiers uses the same set of context features, taken directly from the data provided by the task organizers. The features we used included: • Bag-of-words (unigrams) • Bigrams and trigrams around the target word","• Weighted unigrams surrounding the target word The weighted unigram features increased the frequencies of the ten words before and after the target word by inserting them multiple times into the bag-of-words. 308","Many words in the Chinese data were broken up into “subwords”: since we were unsure how to handle these and since their appearance seemed inconsistent, we decided to simply treat each subword as a word for the purposes of creating bigrams, trigrams, and weighted unigrams. 2.2 Classifiers Our system consists of five unique classifiers. Three of the classifiers were selected by our combination system, while the other two were found to be detrimental to its performance. We describe the contributing classifiers first. Table 1 shows the results of each classifier, as well as our classifier combination system. 2.2.1 Naı̈ve Bayes","The Naı̈ve Bayes classifier is based on Bayes’ the-orem, which allows us to define the similarity between an instance, I, and a sense class, Sj, as: Sim(I, Sj) = P r(I, Sj) = P r(Sj) ∗ P r(I|Sj)","We then choose the sense with the maximum similarity to the test instance. Additive Smoothing","Additive smoothing is a technique that is used to attempt to improve the information gained from low-frequency words, in tasks such as speech pattern recognition (Chen and Goodman, 1998). We used additive smoothing in the Naı̈ve Bayes classifier. To implement additive smoothing, we added a very small number, δ, to the frequency count of each feature (and divided the final product by this δ value times the size of the feature set to maintain accurate probabilities). This small number has almost no effect on more frequent words, but boosts the score of less common, yet potentially equally informative, words. 2.2.2 Decision List","The decision list classifier uses the log-likelihood of correspondence between each context feature and each sense, using additive smoothing (Yarowsky, 1994). The decision list was created by ordering the correspondences from strongest to weakest. In-stances that did not match any rule in the decision list were assigned the most frequent sense, as calculated from the training data. 2.2.3 Nearest Neighbor Cosine","The nearest neighbor cosine classifier required the creation of a term-document matrix, which contains a row for each training instance of an ambiguous word, and a column for each feature that can occur in the context of an ambiguous word. The rows of this matrix are referred to as sense vectors because each row represents a combination of the features of all ambiguous words that share the same sense.","The nearest neighbor cosine classifier compares each of the training vectors to each ambiguous instance vector. The cosine between the ambiguous vector and each of the sense vectors is calculated, and the sense that is the “nearest” (largest cosine, or smallest angle) is selected by the classifier. TF-IDF","TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a method for automatically adjusting the frequency of words based on their semantic importance to a document in a corpus. TF-IDF decreases the value of words that occur in more different documents. The equation we used for TF-IDF is: tfi · idfi = ni · log (","|D| |D : tiεD| ) where ni is the number of occurrences of a term ti, and D is the set of all training documents.","TF-IDF is used in an attempt to minimize the noise from words such as “and” that are extremely common, but, since they are common across all training instances, carry little semantic content. 2.2.4 Non-contributing Classifiers","We implemented a classifier based on Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998). To do the calculations required for LSA, we used the SVDLIBC library1",". Because this classifier actually weakened our combination system (in cross-validation), our classifier combination (Section 2.3) does not include it.","We also implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, which treats each individual training instance 1 http://tedlab.mit.edu/∼","dr/SVDLIBC/ 309 as a separate vector (instead of treating each set of training instances that makes up a given sense as a single vector), and finds the k-nearest training instances to the test instance. The most frequent sense among the k-nearest to the test instance is the selected sense. Unfortunately, the k-NN classifier did not improve the results of our combined system and so it is not included in our classifier combination. 2.3 Classifier Combination The classifier combination algorithm that we implement is based on a simple voting system. Each classifier returns a score for each sense: the Naı̈ve Bayes classifier returns a probability, the cosine-based classifiers (including LSA) return a cosine distance, and the decision list classifier returns the weight associated with the chosen feature (if no feature is selected, the frequency of the most frequent sense is used). The scores from each classifier are normalized to the range [0,1], multiplied by an empirically determined weight for that classifier, and summed for each sense. The combiner then chooses the sense with the highest score. We used cross validation to determine the weight for each classifier, and it was during that test that we discovered that the best constant for the LSA and k-NN classifiers was zero. The most likely explanation for this is that the LSA and k-NN are doing similar, only less accurate, classifications as the nearest neighbor classifier, and so have little new knowledge to add to the combiner. We also implemented a simple majority voting system, where the chosen sense is the sense chosen by the most classifiers, but found it to be less accurate. 2.4 Evaluation To increase the accuracy of our system, we needed to optimize various parameters by running the training data through 10-way cross-validation and averaging the scores from each set. Table 2 shows the results of this cross-validation in determining the δ value used in the additive smoothing for both the Naı̈ve Bayes classifier and for the decision list classifier.","We also experimented with different feature sets. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3.

The methods used are applicable to any lexical sample task, and have been applied to lexical sample tasks in previous Senseval competitions."]},{"title":"3 Task 14","paragraphs":["The goal of Task 14: Affective Text is to take a list of headlines and meaningfully annotate their emotional content. Each headline was scored along seven axes: six predefined emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, and Surprise) on a scale from 0 to 100, and the negative/positive polarity (valence) of the headline on a scale from −100 to +100. 310","Naı̈ve Bayes Feature Dec.

All feature sets include a simple, unweighted bag-of-words in addition to the feature listed. 3.1 Training Data Collection Our system is trained on a set of pre-annotated headlines, building up a knowledge-base of individual words and their emotional significance.","We were initially provided with a trial-set of 250 annotated headlines. We ran 5-way cross-validation with a preliminary version of our system, and found that a dataset of that size was too sparse to effectively tag new headlines. In order to generate a more meaningful knowledge-base, we created a simple web interface for human annotation of headlines. We used untrained, non-experts to annotate an additional 1,000 headlines for use as a training set. The headlines were taken from a randomized collection of headlines from the Associated Press.","We included a subset of the original test set in the set that we put online so that we could get a rough estimate of the consistency of human annotation. We found that consistency varied greatly across the emotions. As can be seen in Table 4, our annotators were very consistent with the trial data annotators on some emotions, while inconsistent on others.","In ad-hoc, post-annotation interviews, our annotators commented that the task was very difficult. What we had initially expected to be a tedious but mindless exercise turned out to be rather involved. They also reported that some emotions were consistently harder to annotate than others. The results in Table 4 seem to bear this out as well. Emotion Correlation Valence 0.83 Sadness 0.81 Joy 0.79 Disgust 0.38 Anger 0.32 Fear 0.19 Surprise 0.19 Table 4: Pearson correlations between trial data annotators and our human annotators.","One difficulty reported by our annotators was determining whether to label the emotion experienced by the reader or by the subject of the headline. For example, the headline “White House surprised at reaction to attorney firings” clearly states that the White House was surprised, but the reader might not have been.","Another of the major difficulties in properly an-notating headlines is that many headlines can be annotated in vastly different ways depending on the viewpoint of the annotator. For example, while the headline “Hundreds killed in earthquake” would be universally accepted as negative, the headline “Italy defeats France in World Cup Final,” can be seen as positive, negative, or even neutral depending on the viewpoint of the reader. These types of problems made it very difficult for our annotators to provide consistent labels. 3.2 Data Processing Before we can process a headline and determine its emotions and valence, we convert our list of tagged headlines into a useful knowledge base. To this end, we create a word-emotion mapping. 3.2.1 Pre-processing","The first step is to lemmatize every word in every headline, in an attempt to reduce the sparseness of our data. We use the CELEX2 (Baayen et al., 1996) data to perform this lemmatization. There are unfortunate cases where lemmatizing actually changes the emotional content of a word (unfortunate becomes fortunate), but without lemmatization, our data is simply too sparse to be of any use. Once we have our list of lemmatized words, we score the emotions and valence of each word as the average of the emo-311 tions and valence of every headline, H, in which that word, w, appears, ignoring non-content words: Score(Em, w) = ∑ H: w ε H Score(Em, H)","In the final step of pre-processing, we add the synonyms and antonyms of the sense labels themselves to our word-emotion mapping. We queried the web interface for Roget’s New Millennium The-saurus (Thesaurus.com, 2007) and added every word in the first 8 entries for each sense label to our map, with a score of 100 (the maximum possible score) for that sense. We also added every word in the first 4 antonym entries with a score of −40. For example, for the emotion Joy, we added alleviation and amusement with a score of 100, and we added despair and misery with a score of −40. 3.2.2 Processing","After creating our word-emotion mapping, predicting the emotions and valence of a given headline is straightforward. We treat each headline as a bag-of-words and lemmatize each word. Then we look up each word in the headline in our word-emotion map, and average the emotion and valence scores of each word in our map that occurs in the headline. We ignore words that were not present in the training data. 3.3 Evaluation Emotion","Training Size (Headlines)","100 250 1000 Valence 19.07 32.07 35.25 Anger 8.42 13.38 24.51 Disgust 11.22 23.45 18.55 Fear 14.43 18.56 32.52 Joy 31.87 46.03 26.11 Sadness 16.32 35.09 38.98 Surprise 1.15 11.12 11.82 Table 5: A comparison of results on the provided trial data as headlines are added to the training set. The scores are given as Pearson correlations of scores for training sets of size 100, 250, and 1000 headlines.","As can be seen in Table 5, four out of six emotions and the valence increase along with training set size. This leads us to believe that further increases in the size of the training set would continue to improve results. Lack of time prevents a full analysis that can explain the sudden drop of Disgust and Joy.","Table 6 shows our full results from this task. Our system finished third out of five in the valence sub-task and second out of three in the emotion sub-task.

We also used synonym expansion on the emotion label words. Our annotators encountered significant difficulty while tagging training data, due to ambiguity in definition of the task."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["R.H. Baayen, R. Piepenbrock, and L.
