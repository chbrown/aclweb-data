Our systems are all based on a simple process of identifying the components that correspond between two sentences. Currently we use words (that is word forms), lemmas, distributional similar words and grammatical relations identified with a dependency parser. We submitted three systems. All systems only use open class words. Our first system (alignheuristic) tries to obtain a mapping between every open class token using all the above sources of information. Our second system (wordsim) uses a different algorithm and unlike alignheuristic, it does not use the dependency information. The third system (average) simply takes the average of the scores for each item from the other two systems to take advantage of the merits of both systems. For this reason we only provide a brief description of that. The results are promising, with Pearson’s coefficients on each individual dataset ranging from .3765 to .7761 for our relatively simple heuristics based systems that do not require training on different datasets. We provide some analysis of the results and also provide results for our data using Spearman’s, which as a non-parametric measure which we argue is better able to reflect the merits of the di fferent systems (average is ranked between the others)."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Our motivation for the systems entered in the STS task (Agirre et al., 2012) was to model the contribu-","∗","The first author is a visiting scholar on the Erasmus Mundus Masters Program in ‘Language and Communication Technologies’ (LCT, 2007–0060). tion of each linguistic component of both sentences to the similarity of the texts by finding an alignment. Ultimately such a system could be exploited for ranking candidate paraphrases of a chunk of text of any length. We envisage a system as outlined in the future work section. The systems reported are simple baselines to such a system. We have two main systems (alignheuristic and wordsim) and also a system which simply uses the average score for each item from the two main systems (average). In our systems we:","• only deal with open class words as tokens i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. alignheuristic and average also use numbers • assume that tokens have a 1:1 mapping • match: – word forms – lemmas – distributionally similar lemmas – (alignheuristic and average only) ar-","gument or head in a matched grammatical","relation with a word that already has a lex-","ical mapping","• score the sentence pair based on the size of the overlap.

The key issue for semantic textual similarity is that the task is to determine similarity, where similarity is cast as meaning equivalence. 1","In textual entailment the relation under question is the more specific relation of entailment, where the meaning of one sentence is entailed by another and a system needs to determine the direction of the entailment. Lexical substitution relates to semantic textual similarity though the task involves a lemma in the context of a sentence, candidate substitutes are not provided, and the relation at question in the task is one of substitutability. 2","Paraphrase recognition is a highly related task, for example using comparable corpora (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), and it is likely that semantic textual similarity measures might be useful for ranking candidates in paraphrase acquisition.","In addition to various works related to textual entailment, lexical substitution and paraphrasing, there has been some prior work explicitly on semantic text similarity. Semantic textual similarity has been explored in various works. Mihalcea et al. (2006) extend earlier work on word similarity using various WordNet similarity measures (Patwardhan et al., 2003) and a couple of corpus-based distributional measures: PMI-IR (Turney, 2002) and LSA (Berry, 1992). They use a measure which takes a summation over all tokens in both sentences. For each token they find the maximum similarity (WordNet or distributional) weighted by the inverse document frequency of that word. The dis-1","See the guidelines given to the annotators at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/w̃eiwei/workshop/ instructions.pdf 2","This is more or less semantic equivalence since the annotators were instructed to focus on meaning http://www. dianamccarthy.co.uk/files/instructions.pdf. tributional similarity measures perform at a similar level to the knowledge-based measures that use WordNet. Mohler and Mihalcea (2009) adapt this work for automatic short answer grading, that is matching a candidate answer to one supplied by the tutor. Mohler et al. (2011) take this applica-tion forward, combining lexical semantic similarity measures with a graph-alignment which considers dependency graphs using the Stanford dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) in terms of lexical, semantic and syntactic features. A score is then provided for each node in the graph. The features are combined using machine learning.","The systems we propose likewise use lexical similarity and dependency relations, but in a simple heuristic formulation without a man-made thesaurus such as WordNet and without machine learning."]},{"title":"3 Systems","paragraphs":["We lemmatize and part-of-speech tag the data using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). We process the tagged data with default settings of the Malt Parser (Nivre et al., 2007) to dependency parse the data. All systems make use of a distributional thesaurus which lists distributionally similar lemmas (‘neighbours’) for a given lemma. This is a thesaurus constructed using log-dice (Rychlý, 2008) and UkWaC (Ferraresi et al., 2008). 3","Note that we use only the top 20 neighbours for any word in all the methods described below. We have not experimented with varying this threshold.","In the following descriptions, we refer to our sentences as s1 and s2 and these open classed tokens within those sentences as ti ∈ s1 and t j ∈ s2 where each token in either sentence is represented by a word (w), lemma (l), part-of-speech (p) and grammatical relation (gr), identified by the Malt parser, to its dependency head at a given position (hp) in the same sentence. 3.1 alignheuristic This method uses nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and numbers.

If there is no alignment for words or lemmas then it does the same matching process (s1 given s2 and vice versa) for distributionally similar neighbours using the distributional thesaurus mentioned above (tmtch) and also another matching process looking for a corresponding grammatical relation identified with the Malt parser in the other sentence where the head (or argument) already has a match in both sentences (rmtch).","A fuller and more formal description of the algorithm follows:","1. retain nouns, verbs (not be), adjectives, adverbs and numbers in both sentences s1 and s2. 2. wmtch: (a) look for word matches","• wi ∈ s1 to w j ∈ s2, left to right i.e. the first matchingw j ∈ s2 is selected as a match for wi.","• w j ∈ s2 to wi ∈ s1, left to right i.e. the first matchingwi ∈ s1 is selected as a match for w j","(b) and then lemma matches for any ti ∈ s1 and t j ∈ s1 not matched in steps 2a","• li ∈ s1 to l j ∈ s2 , left to right i.e. the first matching l j ∈ s2 is selected as a match for li.","• l j ∈ s2 to li ∈ s1 , left to right i.e. the first matching li ∈ s1 is selected as a match for l j","3. using only ti ∈ s1 and t j ∈ s2 not matched in the above steps:","• tmtch: match lemma and PoS (l + p) with the distributional thesaurus against the top 20 most similar lemma-pos entries.

The solid lines show alignments between words. Composite and composite are not matched because the lemmatizer assumes that the former is a proper noun and does not decapitalise; we could decapitalise all proper nouns. The dotted arcs show parallel dependency relations in the sentences where the argument (Nasdaq) is matched by wmtch. The rmtch process therefore assumes the corresponding heads (rise and climb) align. In addition, tmtch finds a match fromclimb to rise as rise is in the top 20 most similar words (neighbours) in the distributional thesaurus. climb is not however in the top 20 for rise and so a link is not found in the other direction. We have not yet experimented with validating the thesaurus and grammatical relation processes together, though that would be worthwhile in future. 3.2 wordsim In this method, we first choose the shortest sentence based on the number of open words. Let s1 and s2 be the shortest and longest sentences respectively. For every lemma li ∈ s1, we find its best matching lemma l j ∈ s2 using the following heuristics and assigning an alignment score as follows:","1. if li=l j, then the alignment score of li (algnscr(li)) is one. 2. else li ∈ s1 is matched with a lemma l j ∈ s2 with which it has the highest distributional similarity. 6","The alignment score, algnscr(l","i) is the distributional similarity between li and l j (which is always less than one).","The final sentence similarity score between the pair s1 and s2 is computed as sim(s1, s2) = ∑","li∈s1 algnscr(li) |s1| (2) 3.3 average This system simple uses the average score for each item from alignheuristic and wordsim.

We conducted further analysis for the alignheuristic system and that is reported in the following subsec-tion. We can see that while the alignheuristic is better on the MSRpar and SMT-eur datasets, the wordsim outperforms it on the MSRvid dataset, which contains shorter, simpler sentences. One reason might be that the wordsim credits alignments in one direction only and this works well when sentences are of a similar length but can loose out on the longer paraphrase and SMT data.

In table 1 we report the results on the training data for the system that we uploaded, however in table 2 we report more recent results for the final system but with different values of wt. From table 2 it seems that results may have been improved if we had determined the final value of wt after debugging our system fully, however this depends on the type of data as 0.4 was optimal for the datasets with more complex sentences (MSRpar and SMT-eur).","In table 3, we report results for alignheuristic with and without the distributional similarity thesaurus (tmtch) and the dependency relations (rmtch). In table 4 we show the total number of token alignments made by the different matching processes on the training data. We see, from table 4 that the MSRvid data relies on the thesaurus and dependency relations to a far greater extent than the other datasets, presumably because of the shorter sentences where many have a few contrasting words in similar syntactic relations, for example s1 Someone is drawing. s2 Someone is dancing. 8","We see from table 3 that the use of these matching processes is less accurate for MSRvid and that while tmtch improves performance, rmtch seems to degrade performance.

The results in the ’all’ column which combine all datasets together are at odds with our intuitions. Our systems were ranked higher in every individual dataset compared to the ’all’ ranking, with the exception of wordsim and the MSRpar dataset. This ’all’ metric is anticipated to impact systems that have different settings for different types of data however we did not train our systems to run differently on different data. We used exactly the same parameter settings for each system on every dataset. We believe Pearson’s measure has a significant impact on results because it is a parametric measure and as such the shape of the distribution (the distribution of scores) is assumed to be normal. We present the results in table 6 from new metrics proposed by participants during the post-results discussion: Allnrm (normalised) and mean (this score is weighted by the number of sentence pairs in each dataset). 9 The Allnrm score, proposed by a participant during the discussion phase to try and combat issues with 9 Post-results discussion is archived at http://groups.","google.com/group/sts-semeval/topics the ’all’ score, also does not accord with our intuition given the ranks of our systems on the individual datasets. The mean score, proposed by another participant, however does reflect performance on the individual datasets. Our average system is ranked between alignheuristic and wordsim which is in line with our expectations given results on the training data and individual datasets.","As mentioned above, an issue with the use of Pearson’s correlation coefficient is that it is parametric and assumes that the scores are normally distributed. We calculated Spearman’s ρ which is the non-parametric equivalent of Pearson’s and uses the ranks of the scores, rather than the actual scores. 10 The results are presented in table 7. We cannot calculate the results for other systems, and therefore the ranks for our system, since we do not have the other system’s outputs but we do see that the relative performance of our system on ’all’ is more in line with our expectations: average, which simply uses the average of the other two systems for each item, is usually ranked between the other two systems, depending on the dataset. Spearman’s ’all’ gives a similar ranking of our three systems as the mean score. We also show average ρ. This is a macro average of the Spearman’s value for the 5 datasets without weighting by the number of sentence pairs. 11 10","Note that Spearman’s ρ is often a little lower than Pearson’s (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) 11","We do recognise the difficulty in determining metrics on a new pilot study.

There are many trivial fixes that may improve the basic algorithm, such as decapitalising proper nouns. There are many things we would like to try, such as validating the dependency matching process with the thesaurus matching. We would like to match larger units rather than tokens, with preferences towards the longer matching blocks. In parallel to the development of alignheuristic, we developed a system which measures the similarity between a node in the dependency tree of s1 and a node in the dependency tree of s2 as the sum of the lexical similarity of the lemmas at the nodes and the similarity of its children nodes. We did not submit a run for the system as it did not perform as well as alignheuristic, probably because the score focused on structure too much. We hope to spend time developing this system in future.","Ultimately, we envisage a system that:","• can have non 1:1 mappings between tokens, i.e. a phrase may be paraphrased as a word for example blow up may be paraphrased as explode","• can map between sequences of non-contiguous words for example the words in the phrase blow up may be separated but mapped to the word explode as in the bomb exploded ↔ They blew it up","• has categories (such as equivalence, entailment, negation, omission . . . ) associated with each mapping. Speculation, modality and sentiment should be indicated on any relevant chunk so that differences can be detected between candidate and referent","• scores the candidate using a function of the scores of the mapped units (as in the systems described above) but alters the score to reflect the category as well as the source of the mapping, for example entailment without equivalence should reduce the similarity score, in contrast to equivalence, and negation should reduce this still further","Crucially we would welcome a task where annotators would also provide a score on sub chunks of the sentences (or arbitrary blocks of text) that align along with a category for the mapping (equivalence, entailment, negation etc..). This would allow us to look under the hood at the text similarity task and determine the reason behind the similarity judgments."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank the task organisers for their efforts in or-ganising the task and their readiness to take on board discussions on this as a pilot.
