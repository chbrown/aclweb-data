A promising way to provide insight into these questions was brought forward as Shared Task 1 in the SemEval-2014 campaign for semantic evalua-tion (Marelli et al., 2014). In this task, a system is given a set of sentence pairs, and has to predict for each pair whether the sentences are somehow related in meaning. Interestingly, this is done using two different metrics: the first stemming from the formal tradition (contradiction, entailed, neutral), and the second in a distributional fashion (a similarity score between 1 and 5). We participated in this shared task with a system rooted in formal semantics. In particular, we were interested in finding out whether paraphrasing techniques could increase the accuracy of our system, whether meaning representations used for textual entailment are This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

This is essentially an improved version of the framework introduced by Bos & Markert (2006).","To generate background knowledge that could assist in finding a proof we used the lexical database WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). We also used a large database of paraphrases (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) to alter the second sentence in case no proof was found at the first attempt, inspired by Bosma & Callison-Burch (2006). The core system reached high precision on entailment and contradiction. To increase recall, we used a classifier trained on the output from our similarity task system (see Section 3) to reclassify the “neutrals” into possible entailments. 2.2 Technicalities The semantic parser that we used is Boxer (Bos, 2008). It is the last component in the pipeline of the C&C tools (Curran et al., 2007), comprising a tokenizer, POS-tagger, lemmatizer (Minnen et","1","To reproduce these results in a linux environment (with SWI Prolog) one needs to install the C&C tools (this in-cludes Boxer and the RTE system), the Vampire theorem prover, the two model builders Paradox and Mace-2, and the PPDB-1.0 XL database. Detailed instructions can be found in the src/scripts/boxer/sick/README folder of the C&C tools. 642 al., 2001), and a robust parser for CCG (Steedman, 2001). Boxer produces semantic representations based on Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). We used the standard translation from Discourse Representation Structures to first-order logic, rather than the one based on modal first-order logic (Bos, 2004), since the shared task data did not contain any sentences with propositional argument verbs.","After conversion to first-order logic, we checked with the theorem prover Vampire (Riazanov and Voronkov, 2002) whether a proof could be found for the first sentence entailing the second, and whether a contradiction could be detected for the conjunction of both sentences translated into first-order logic. If neither a proof nor a contradiction could be found within 30 seconds, we used the model builder Paradox (Claessen and Sörensson, 2003) to produce a model of the two sentences separately, and one of the two sentences together. However, even though Paradox is an efficient piece of software, it does not always return minimal models with respect to the extensions of the non-logical symbols. Therefore, in a second step, we asked the model builder Mace-2 (Mc-Cune, 1998) to construct a minimal model for the domain size established by Paradox. These models are used as features in the similarity task (Section 3).","Background knowledge is important to increase recall of the theorem prover, but hard to acquire automatically (Bos, 2013). Besides translating hypernym relations of WordNet to first-order logic axioms, we also reasoned that it would be beneficial to have a way of dealing with multi-word expressions. But instead of translating paraphrases into axioms, we used them to rephrase the input sentence in case no proof or contradiction was found for the original sentence pair. Given a paraphrase SRC↦→TGT, we rephrased the first sentence of a pair only if SRC matches with up to four words, no words of TGT were already in the first sentence, and every word of TGT appeared in the second sentence. The paraphrases themselves were taken from PPDB-1.0 (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). In the training phrase we found that the XL version (comprising o2m, m2o, phrasal, lexical) gave the best results (using a larger version caused a strong decrease in precision, while smaller versions lead to a decrease in recall).","We trained a separate classifier in order to reclassify items judged by our RTE system as being neutral. This classifier uses a single feature, namely the relatedness score for each sentence pair. As training material, we used the gold relatedness scores from the training and trial sets. For classification of the test set, we used the relatedness scores obtained from our Semantic Similarity system (see Section 3). The classifier is a Support Vector Machine classifier, in the implementation provided by Scikit-Learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), based on the commonly used implementation LIB-SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011). We used the implementation’s standard parameters. 2.3 Results We submitted two runs. The first (primary) run was produced by a configuration that included reclassifying the ’neutrals’. The second run is without the reclassification of the neutrals. After submission we ran a system that did not use the paraphrasing technique in order to measure what in-fluence the PPDB had on our performance. The results are summarized in Table 1. In the training phase we got the best results for the configuration using the PPDB and reclassication, which was submitted as our primary run. Table 1: Results on the entailment task for various system configurations. System Configuration Accuracy most frequent class baseline 56.7 −PPDB, −reclassification 77.6 +PPDB, −reclassification 79.6 +PPDB, +reclassification 81.6","In sum, our system for recognizing entailment performed well reaching 82% accuracy and by far outperforming the most-frequent class baseline (Table 1). We show some selected examples illustrating the strengths of our system below. Example 1627 (ENTAILMENT) A man is mixing a few ingredients in a bowl Some ingredients are being mixed in a bowl by a person Example 2709 (CONTRADICTION) There is no person boiling noodles A woman is boiling noodles in water Example 9051 (ENTAILMENT) A pair of kids are sticking out blue and green colored tongues Two kids are sticking out blue and green colored tongues","A proof for entailment is found for Ex. 1627, because for passive sentences Boxer produces a meaning representation equivalent to their active variants. A contradiction is detected for Ex. 2709 because of the way negation is handled by Boxer. Both examples trigger background knowledge from WordNet hyperonyms (man → person; woman → person) that is used in the 643 proofs.2","Ex. 9051 shows how paraphrasing helps, here “a pair of” ↦→ “two”."]},{"title":"3 Determining Semantic Similarity 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["The Semantic Similarity system follows a supervised approach to solving the regression problem of determining the similarity between each given sentence pair. The system uses a variety of features, ranging from simpler ones such as word overlap, to more complex ones in the form of deep semantic features and features derived from a compositional distributional semantic model. The majority of these features are derived from the models from our RTE system (see Section 2). 3.2 Technicalities 3.2.1 Regressor The regressor used is a Random Forest Regressor in the implementation provided by Scikit-Learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Random forests are robust with respect to noise and do not overfit easily (Breiman, 2001). These two factors make them a highly suitable choice for our approach, since we are dealing with a relatively large number of weak features, i.e., features which may be seen as individually containing a rather small amount of information for the problem at hand.","Our parameter settings for the regressor is follows. We used a total of 1000 trees, with a maximum tree depth of 20. At each node in a tree the regressor looked at maximum 3 features in order to decide on the split. The quality of each such split is determined using mean squared error as measure. These parameter values were optimised when training on the training set, with regards to performance on the trial set. 3.2.2 Feature overview We used a total of 32 features for our regressor. Due to space constraints, we have sub-divided our features into groups by the model/method in-volved. For all features we compared the outcome of the original sentence pair with the outcome of the paraphrased sentence pairs (see Section 2.2)3",". If the paraphrased sentence pair yielded a higher feature overlap score than the original sentence pair, we utilized the former. In other words, we 2","In the training data around 20% of the proofs for entailment were established with the help of WordNet, but only 4% for detecting contradictions. 3","In addition to the PPDB we added handling of negations, by removing some negations {not, n’t} and substituting others {no:a, none:some, nobody:somebody}. assume that the sentence pair generated with paraphrases is a good representation of the original pair, and that similarities found here are an improvement on the original score. Logical model We used the logical models created by Paradox and Mace for the two sentences separately, as well as a combined model (see Section 2.2). The features extracted from this model are the proportion of overlap between the in-stances in the domain, and the proportion of overlap between the relations in the model. Noun/verb overlap We first extracted and lemmatised all nouns and verbs from the sentence pairs. With these lemmas we calculated two new separate features, the overlap of the noun lemmas and the overlap of the verb lemmas. Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) The two most interesting pieces of information which easily can be extracted from the DRS models are the agents and patients. We first extracted the agents for both sentences in a sentence pair, and then computed the overlap between the two lists of agents. Secondly, since all sentences in the corpus have exactly one patient, we extracted the patient of each sentence and used this overlap as a binary feature. Wordnet novelty We build one tree containing all WordNet concepts included in the first sentence, and one containing all WordNet concepts of both sentences together. The difference in size between these two trees is used as a feature. RTE The result from our RTE system (entailment, neutral or contradiction) is used as a feature. Compositional Distributional Semantic Model Our CDSM feature is based on word vectors derived using a Skip-Gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b). We used the publicly available word2vec4","tool to calculate these vectors. We trained the tool on a data set consisting of the first billion characters of Wikipedia5 and the English part of the French-English 109 corpus used in the wmt11 translation task6",". The Wikipedia section of the data was pre-processed using a script7","which made the text lower case, removed tables etc. The second section of the data was also converted to lower case prior to training.","We trained the vectors using the following parameter settings.

The skip-gram model with hierarchical softmax, and a negative sampling of 1e-3 was used.","To arrive at the feature used for our regressor, we first calculated the element-wise sum of the vectors of each word in the given sentences. We then calculated the cosine distance between the sentences in the sentence pair. IDs One surprisingly helpful feature was each sentence pair’s ID in the corpus.8","Since this feature clearly is not representative of what one would have access to in a real-world scenario, it was not included in the primary run. Synset Overlap We built one set for each sentence pair consisting of each possible lemma form of all possible noun synsets for each word. The proportion of overlap between the two resulting sets was then used as a feature. Given cases where relatively synonymous words are used (e.g. kid and child), these will often belong to the same synset, thus resulting in a high overlap score. Synset Distance We first generated each possible word pair consisting of one word from each sentence. Using these pairings, we calculated the maximum path similarity between the noun synsets available for these words. This calculation is restricted so that each word in the first sentence in each pair is only used once. Word overlap Our word overlap feature was calculated by first creating one set per sentence, containing each word occurring in that sentence.","8","We discovered that the ordering of the entire data set was informative for the prediction of sentence relatedness. We have illustrated this by using the ordering of the sentences (i.e. the sentence IDs) as a feature in our model, and thereby obtaining better results. Relying on such a non-natural ordering of the sentences would be methodologically flawed, and therefore this feature was not used in our primary run. The four most common words in the corpus were used as a stop list, and removed from each set. The proportion of overlap between the two sets was then used as our word overlap feature. Sentence Lengths The difference in length between the sentence pairs proved to be a somewhat useful feature. Although mildly useful for this particular data set, we do not expect this to be a particularly helpful feature in real world applications. 3.3 Results We trained our system on 5000 sentence pairs, and evaluated it on 4927 sentence pairs. Table 2 contains our scores for the evaluation, broken up per feature group. Our relatedness system yielded the highest scores compared to all other systems in this shared task, as measured by MSE and Spearman correlation scores. Although our system performed slightly worse as measured by Pearson correlation, there is no significant difference to the scores obtained by the two higher ranked systems."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Our work shows that paraphrasing techniques can be used to improve the results of a textual entailment system.
