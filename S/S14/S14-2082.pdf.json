Models that incorporate rich global features are typically more accurate, even if pruning is necessary or decoding needs to be approximate (McDonald et al., 2006; Koo and Collins, 2010; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Martins et al., 2009, 2013). This paper applies the same rationale to semantic dependency parsing, in which the output variable is a semantic graph, rather than a syntactic tree. We extend a recently proposed dependency parser, TurboParser (Martins et al., 2010, 2013), to be able to perform semantic parsing using any of the three formalisms considered in this shared task (DM, PAS, and PCEDT). The result is TurboSemanticParser, which we release as open-source software.1","We describe here a second order model for semantic parsing (§2).

We cast semantic parsing as a structured prediction problem. Let x be a sentence and Y(x) the set of possible dependency graphs. We assume each candidate graph y ∈ Y(x) can be represented as a set of substructures (called parts) in an underlying set S (e.g., predicates, arcs, pairs of adjacent arcs). We design a score function f which decomposes as a sum over these substructures, f (x, y) :=","∑","s∈S fs(x, ys). We parametrize this function using a weight vector w, and write each atomic function as fs(x, ys) := w·φs(x, ys), where φs(x, ys) is a vector of local features.

(1) Our choice of parts is given in Figure 2. The second order parts are inspired by prior work in syntactic parsing, modeling interactions for pairs of (unlabeled) dependency arcs, such as grandparents (Carreras, 2007) and siblings (Smith and Eisner, 2008; Martins et al., 2009). The main novelty is co-parent parts, which, to the best of our knowledge, were never considered before, as they only make sense when multiple parents are allowed.","If all parts were basic, decoding could be done independently for each predicate p, as illustrated in Algorithm 1. The total runtime, for a sentence with L words, is O(L2","|R|), where R is the set of semantic roles. Adding consecutive siblings still permits independent decoding for each predicate, but dynamic programming is necessary to decode the best argument frame, increasing the runtime to O(L3","|R|). The addition of consecutive co-parents, grandparents, and arbitrary siblings and co-parents breaks this independency and sets a demand for approximate decoding. Even without second-order parts, the inclusion of hard constraints (such as requiring some roles to be unique, see §3) also makes the problem harder.2","Rather than looking for a model in which exact decoding is tractable, which could be even more stringent for parsing semantic graphs than for dependency trees, we embrace approximate decoding strategies. Namely, our approach is based on","2","Albeit the dynamic program could still incorporate constraints for unique roles (by appending a bit-string to the state to mark semantic roles that have been filled), runtime be-comes exponential in the number of unique roles, only being feasible when this number is small. Figure 2: Parts considered in this paper. The top row illustrate the basic parts, representing the event that a word is a predicate, or the existence of an arc between a predicate and an argument, even-tually labeled with a semantic role. Our second-order model looks at some pairs of arcs: arcs bear-ing a grandparent relationship, arguments of the same predicate, predicates sharing the same argument, and consecutive versions of these two. dual decomposition, a class of optimization techniques that tackle the dual of combinatorial problems in a modular and extensible manner (Komodakis et al., 2007; Rush et al., 2010). We employ alternating directions dual decomposition (AD3","; Martins et al., 2011). Like the subgradient algorithm of Rush et al. (2010), AD3","splits the original problem into local subproblems, and seeks an agreement on the overlapping variables. The difference is that the AD3","subproblems have an additional quadratic term to accelerate consensus, achieving a faster convergence rate both in theory and in practice (Martins et al., 2012, 2013). For several factors (such as logic factors representing AND, OR and XOR constraints, budget constraints, and binary pairwise factors), these quadratic subproblems can be solved efficiently. For dense or structured factors, the quadratic subproblems can be solved as a sequence of local Viterbi decoding steps, via an active set method (Martins, 2014); this local decoding operation is the same that needs to be performed in the subgradient algorithm. We describe these subproblems in detail in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Solving the Subproblems Predicate and Arc-Factored Parts.","paragraphs":["We capture all the basic parts with a single component. As stated in §2, local decoding in this component has a runtime of O(L2","|R|), by using Algorithm 1. Unique Roles. We assume some roles are unique, i.e., they can occur at most once for the 472","same predicate.3","To cope with unique roles, we","add hard constraints of the kind ∑","a I(p r → a ∈ y) ≤ 1, ∀p, ∀r ∈ Runiq, (2) where Runiq is the set of unique roles. This set is obtained from the training data by looking at the roles that never occur multiple times in the gold argument frames.4","The constraint above corresponds to a ATMOSTONE factor, which is built-in in AD3","and can be decoded in linear time (rendering the runtime O(L2","|Runiq|) when aggregat-ing all such factors). These have also been used by Das et al. (2012) in frame-semantic parsing. Grandparents, Arbitrary Siblings and Coparents. The second-order parts in the middle row of Figure 2 all involve the simultaneous inclusion of a pair of arcs, without further dependency on the remaining arcs. We handle each of these parts using a simple pairwise factor (called PAIR in the AD3","toolkit). The total runtime to locally decode these factors is O(L3","). Predicate Automata. To handle consecutive siblings, we adapt the simple head automaton model (Alshawi, 1996; Smith and Eisner, 2008; Koo et al., 2010) to semantic parsing. We introduce one automaton for each predicate p and attachment direction (left or right). We describe right-side predicate automata; their left-side counterparts are analogous. Let ⟨a0, a1, . . . , ak+1⟩ be the sequence of right modifiers of p, with a0 = START and ak+1 = END. Then, we have the following component capturing consecutive siblings:","f CSIB","p,→ (p → a1, . . . , p → ak) =","∑k+1","j=1 σCSIB(p, aj−1, aj). (3) Maximizing f CSIB","p,→ via dynamic programming has a cost of O(L2","), yielding O(L3",") total runtime. Argument Automata. For consecutive co-parents, we introduce another automaton which is analogous to the predicate automaton, but where arrows are reversed. Let ⟨p0, p1, . . . , pk+1⟩ be the sequence of right predicates that take a as argument (the left-side case is analagous), with p0 = START and pk+1 = END. We define:","f CCP","a,←(a ← p1, . . . , a ← pk) =","∑k+1","j=1 σCCP(a, pj−1, pj). (4)","3","Such roles have been called “deterministic” by Flanigan et al. (2014).","4","For PAS, all 43 roles were found unique; for DM, this number is 40 out of 52, and for PCEDT only 3 out of 69.","The total runtime is also O(L3 )."]},{"title":"4 Features","paragraphs":["We define binary features for each part represented in Figure 2. Most of the features are taken from TurboParser (Martins et al., 2013), while others are inspired by the semantic parser of Johansson and Nugues (2008). Those features marked with † require information from the dependency syntactic parser, and are only used in the open track.5 Predicate Features.

The cost function takes into account mismatches between predicted and gold dependencies, with a cost cP on labeled arcs incorrectly predicted (false positives) and a cost cR on gold labeled arcs that were missed (false negatives). These values were set through cross-validation in the dev set, yielding cP = 0.4 and cR = 0.6 in all runs, except for the DM and PCEDT datasets in the closed track, for which cP = 0.3 and cR = 0.7.","To speed up decoding, we discard arcs whose posterior probability is below 10−4",", according to a probabilistic unlabeled first-order pruner. Table 1 shows a significant reduction of the search space with a very small drop in recall.","Table 2 shows our final results in the test set, for a model trained in the train and development partitions. Our system achieved the best score in the open track (an LF score of 86.27%, averaged over DM, PAS, and PCEDT), and the second best in the closed track, after the Peking team. Overall, we observe that the precision and recall in PCEDT are far below the other two formalisms, but this difference is much smaller when looking at unlabeled scores. Comparing the results in the closed and open tracks, we observe a consistent improvement in the three formalisms of around 1% in F1 from using syntactic information. While this confirms previous findings that syntactic features are important in semantic role labeling (Toutanova et al., 2005; Johansson and Nugues, 2008), these improvements are less striking than expected. We conjecture this is due to the fact that our model in the closed track already incorporates a variety of contextual features which are nearly as informative as those extracted from the dependency trees.","Finally, to assess the importance of the second order features, Table 3 reports experiments in the dev-set that progressively add several groups of features, along with runtimes. We can see that siblings, co-parents, and grandparents all provide valuable information that improves the final scores (with the exception of the PCEDT labeled scores, where the difference is negligible). This comes at only a small cost in terms of runtime, which is around 1,000 tokens per second for the full models.","UR # UA/tok LR # LA/tok DM 99.33 3.5 (13.4%) 99.22 34.4 (2.5%) PAS 99.53 3.3 (12.5%) 99.49 20.8 (1.9%) PCEDT 99.03 2.1 (8.2%) 98.77 54.5 (3.0%) Table 1: Pruner statistics in the dev-set, for the open track.
