Our system consists of two components to address two of the subtasks respectively: a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based classifier for Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and a linear classifier for Aspect Term Polarity Classification (ATP). For the ATE subtask, we implement a variety of lexicon, syntactic and semantic features, as well as cluster features induced from unlabeled data. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performances in ATE, ranking 1st (among 28 submissions) and 2rd (among 27 submissions) for the restaurant and laptop domain respectively."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Sentiment analysis on document and sentence level no longer fulfills user’s needs of getting more accurate and precise information. By perform-ing sentiment analysis at the aspect level, we can help users gain more insights on the sentiments of the various aspects of the target entity. Task 4 of SemEval-2014 provides a good platform for (1) aspect term extraction and (2) aspect term polarity classification.","For the first subtask, we follow the approach of Jakob and Gurevych (2010) by modeling term extraction as a sequential labeling task. Specifically, we leverage on semantic and syntactic resources to extract a variety of features and use CRF as the learning algorithm. For the second subtask, we","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. Page numbers and proceedings footer are added by the organisers.

Our system achieves good performances for the first subtask in both domains, ranking 1st for the restaurant domain, and 2nd for the laptop domain.","The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe our ATE system in detail, including experiments and result analysis. Section 3 describes the general approach of our ATP system. Finally, Section 4 summarizes our work."]},{"title":"2 Aspect Term Extraction","paragraphs":["This subtask is to identify the aspects of given target entities in the restaurant and laptop domains. Many aspect terms in the laptop domain contains digits or special characters such as “17 inch screen” and “screen/video resolution”; while in the restaurant domain, aspects in the sentences are specific for a type of restaurants such as “pizza” for Italian restaurants and “sushi” for Japanese restaurants.","We model ATE as a sequential labeling task and extract features to be used for CRF training. Besides the common features used in traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems, we also utilize extensive external resources to build various name lists and word clusters. 2.1 Preprocessing Following the traditional BIO scheme used in sequential labeling, we assign a label for each word in the sentence, where “B-TERM” indicates the start of an aspect term, “I-TERM” indicates the continuation of an aspect term, and “O” indicates not an aspect term.","All sentences are tokenized and parsed using the Stanford Parser1",". The parsing information is used","1","http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ lex-parser.shtml 235 to extract various syntactic features (e.g. POS, head word, dependency relation) described in the next section. 2.2 General (or Closed) Features In this section, we describe the features commonly used in traditional NER systems. Such features can easily be extracted from the training set or with the help of publicly available NLP tools (e.g. Stanford Parser, NLTK, etc). 2.2.1 Word The string of the current token and its lowercase format are used as features. To capture more context information, we also extract the previous and next word strings (in original format) as additional word features. 2.2.2 POS The part-of-speech (POS) tag of the current token is used as a feature. Since aspect terms are often nouns, the POS tag provides useful information about the lexical category of the word, especially for unseen words in the test sentences. 2.2.3 Head Word This feature represents the head word of the current token. If the current token does not have a head word, the value “null” is used. 2.2.4 Head Word POS This feature represents the POS of the head word of the current token. If the current token does not have a head word, the value “null” is used. 2.2.5 Dependency Relation From the dependency parse, we identify the dependency relations of the current token. We extract two different sets of strings: one set contains the relation strings (e.g. “amod”, “nsubj”) where the current token is the governor (i.e. head) of the relation, the other set contains the relation strings where the current token is the dependent of the relation. For each set, we only keep certain relations: “amod”, “nsubj” and “dep” for the first set and “nsubj”, “dobj” and “dep” for the second set. Each set of strings is used as a feature value for the current token, resulting in two separate features. 2.2.6 Name List Name lists (or gazetteers) have proven to be useful in the task of NER (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). We create a name list feature that uses the name lists for membership testing.","For each domain, we extract two high precision name lists from the training set. For the first list, we collect and keep those aspect terms whose frequency counts are greater than c1. Since an aspect term can be multi-word, we also extract a second list to consider the counts of individual words. All words whose frequency counts greater than c2 are collected. For each word, the probability of it be-ing annotated as an aspect word in the training set is calculated. Only those words whose probability value is greater than t is kept in the second list. The specified values of c1, c2 and t for each domain are determined using 5-fold cross validation.","2.3 Open/External Sources Generated Features This section describes additional features we use that require external resources and/or complex processings. 2.3.1 WordNet Taxonomy This feature represents the set of syntactic categories (e.g “noun.food”) of the current token as organized in WordNet lexicographer files (Miller, 1995). We only consider noun synsets of the token when determining the syntactic categories. 2.3.2 Word Cluster Turian et al. (2010) used unsupervised word representations as extra word features to improve the accuracy of both NER and chunking. We followed their approach by inducing Brown clusters and K-means clusters from in-domain unlabeled data.","We used the review text from two sources of unlabeled dataset: the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset that contains Amazon product reviews (Blitzer et al., 2007)2",", and the Yelp Phoenix Academic Dataset that contains user reviews3",".","We induce 1000 Brown clusters for each dataset4",". For each word in the training/testing set, its corresponding binary (prefix) string is used as the feature value.","We experiment with different prefix lengths and use the best settings using 5-fold cross validation.","2","We used the unprocessed.tar.gz archive found at http://www.cs.jhu.edu/m̃dredze/ datasets/sentiment/","3","http://www.yelp.com/dataset_ challenge/","4","Brown clustering are induced using the implementation by Percy Liang found at https://github.com/ percyliang/brown-cluster/. 236 For the laptop domain, we create a Brown cluster feature from Amazon Brown clusters, using prefix length of 5. For the restaurant domain, we created three Brown cluster features: two from Yelp Brown clusters, using prefix lengths of 4 and 8, and the last one from Amazon Brown clusters, using prefix length of 10.","K-means clusters are induced using the word2vec tool (Mikolov et al., 2013)5",". Similar to Brown cluster feature, the cluster id of each word is used as the feature value.","When running the word2vec tool, we specially tune the values for word vector size (size), cluster size (classes) and sub-sampling threshold (sample) for optimum 5-fold cross validation performances. We create one K-means cluster feature for the laptop domain from Amazon K-means clusters (size = 100, classes = 400, sample = 0.0001), and two K-means cluster features for the restaurant domain, one from Yelp K-means clusters (size = 200, classes = 300, sample = 0.001), and the other from Amazon K-means clusters (size = 1000, classes = 300, sample = 0.0001).","2.3.3 Name List Generated using Double Propagation We implement the Double Propagation (DP) algorithm described in Qiu et al. (2011) to identify possible aspect terms in a semi-supervised way. The terms identified are stored in a list which is used as another name list feature.","Our implementation follow the Logic Programming approach described in Liu et al. (2013)6",". We write our rules in Prolog and use SWI-Prolog7","as the solver.","We use the seed opinion lexicon provided by Hu and Liu (2004) for both domain8",". In addition, for the restaurant domain, we augment the opinion lexicon with addition seed opinion words by using the 75 restaurant seed words listed in Sauper and Barzilay (2013). To increase the coverage, we expand this list of 75 words by including related words (e.g. antonym, similar to) in WordNet. The final expanded list contains 551 words.","Besides the seed opinion words, we also use the last word of each aspect term in the training set as a seed aspect word.","The propagation rules we use are modifications 5 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 6 We did not implement incorrect aspect pruning. 7 http://www.swi-prolog.org/ 8 We ignore the polarity of the opinion word. of the rules presented in Liu et al. (2013). A total of 11 rules and 13 rules are used for the laptop and restaurant domain respectively. An example of a Prolog rule concerning the extraction of aspect words is stated below: aspect(A) :-","relation(nsubj, O, A),","relation(cop, O, _),","pos(A, P),","is_noun(P),","opinion(O).","For example, given the sentence “The rice is amazing.”, and “amazing” is a known opinion word, we can extract “rice” as a possible aspect word using the rule.","All our rules can only identify individual words as possible aspect terms. To consider a phrase as a possible aspect term, we extend the left boundary of the identified span to include any consective noun words right before the identified word. 2.4 Algorithms and Evaluation We use the CRFsuite tool (Okazaki, 2007) to train our CRF model. We use the default settings, except for the negative state features (-p feature.possible states=1).

The constrained submission only uses the Word and Name List features, while all features listed in Table 1 and Table 2 are used in the unconstrained submission for the respective domain. 2.6 Results on Test Set Using the optimum feature set described in Section 2.5, we train separate models for each domain and evaluate them against the SemEval-2014 Task 4 test set9",". Table 3 presents the official results of our submissions. We also include the official baseline results and the results of the top three participating systems for comparison (Pontiki et al., 2014).","As shown from the table, our system performed well for both domains. For the laptop domain, our system is ranked 2nd and 3rd (among 27 submissions) for the unconstrained and constrained set-ting respectively. For the restaurant domain, our system is ranked 1st and 9th (among 28 submissions) for the unconstrained and constrained set9 We train each model using only single-domain data. ting respectively.","Our unconstrained submissions for both domains outperformed our constrained submissions, due to a significantly better recall. This indicates the use of additional external resources (e.g. unlabeled data) can improve the extraction performance. 2.7 Further Analysis of Feature Engineering Table 4 shows the F1 loss on the test set resulting from training with each group of feature removed. We also include the F1 loss when all features are used. Feature laptop restaurant Word 0.0260 0.0241 Name List 0.0090 0.0054 POS -0.0059 -0.0052 Head Word 0.0072 0.0038 DP Name List 0.0049 0.0064 Word Cluster 0.0061 0.0185 WordNet Taxonomy - -0.0018 Head Word POS -0.0040 -0.0011 Dependency Relation -0.0105 - All features -0.0132 0.0014 Table 4: Feature ablation study on the test set. The quantity is the F1 loss resulted from the removal of a single feature group. The last row indicates the F1 loss when all features are used.","Our ablation study showed that a few of our features are helpful in varying degrees on both domains: Word, Name List, Head Word, DP Name List and Word Cluster. However, the use of the rest of the features individually has a negative impact. In particular, we are surprised that the POS and Dependency Relation features are detrimental to the performances, even though our 5-fold 238 cross validation experiments suggested otherwise. Another observation we make is that the WordNet Taxonomy feature is actually useful for the laptop test set: including this feature would have improved our laptop unconstrained performance from 0.7378 F1 to 0.7510 F1 (+0.0132), which is better than the top system performance. We also note that our restaurant performance on the test set can potentially be improved from 0.8401 F1 to 0.8454 F1 (+0.0052) if we originally omit the POS feature.","Overall, we see that all the features we proposed are potentially beneficial to the task. However, more thorough feature selection experiments should be conducted to prevent overfitting and to identify the settings (e.g. domain) in which each feature may be useful."]},{"title":"3 Aspect Term Polarity","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe a baseline classifier for ATP, where we treat the problem as a multi-class classification problem.","To correctly identify the polarity of an aspect term, it is crucial to know which words within the sentence indicate its sentiment. A general lexicon or WordNet is not sufficient. Thus, we attempt to build the aspect lexicon based on other information such as POS (Sauper and Barzilay, 2013). For example, sentiment words are more likely to be adjectives. 3.1 Features 3.1.1 Aspect Word This is to model the idea that certain aspects tend to have a particular polarity most of the time. We compute the most frequent polarity of each aspect in the training set. For each aspect instance, the feature corresponding to its most frequent polarity is set to 1. 3.1.2 General Sentiment Word Lexicon One sentence may express opinions on multiple aspect terms. According to our observations, words surrounding the aspect term tend to be associated with it. Based on the best settings obtained from 5-fold cross validation, we set a window size of 12 words and consider words with the following POS: JJ*, RB*, VB*, DT and NN*10",".","Some sentiment words are consistent across aspects. For example, “great” for positive and “ter-10 NN* is only used in the restaurant domain. rible” for negative. On the other hand, some sentiment words are quite distinct between aspects. In certain cases, they may have opposite sentiment meanings for different aspects (Kim et al., 2013). For example, “fast” is positive when describing boot up speed but negative when describing battery life. Therefore, a general sentiment word lexicon is created from the training set.","If a general sentiment word occurs in the surrounding context of the aspect instance, the feature value for the matched sentiment word is 1. Since the training set does not contain every possible sentiment expression, we use synonyms and antonyms in RiTa WordNet11","to expand the general sentiment word lexicon. The expanded lexicon contains 2419 words for the laptop domain and 4262 words for the restaurant domain. 3.1.3 Aspect-Sentiment Word Pair Besides general sentiment word lexicon, we also build aspect-sentiment word pair lexicon from the training set. This lexicon contains 9073 word pairs for the laptop domain and 22171 word pairs for the restaurant domain. If an aspect-sentiment word occurs in the surrounding context of the aspect in-stance, the feature value for the matched aspect-sentiment word pair is 1. 3.2 Experiments and Results We use LIBLINEAR12","to train our logistic regression classifier using default settings.","laptop restaurant 5-fold cross validation 0.6322 0.6704 DLIREC unconstrained 0.3654 0.4233 Table 5: Accuracy of the Aspect Term Polarity subtask.","Table 5 shows the classification accuracy of our baseline system on the training and test set for each domain. The performance drops a lot in the test set as we use very simple approaches to generate the lexicons. This may cause overfitting on the training set. We also observe that in the test set of both domains, more than half of the instances are positive. In the future, we can explore on using more sophisticated ways to build more effective features and to better model data skewness.","11","http://www.rednoise.org/rita/wordnet/","12","http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/c̃jlin/ liblinear/ 239"]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["For ATE subtask, we leverage on the vast amount of external resources to create additional effective features, which contribute significantly to the improvement of our system.
