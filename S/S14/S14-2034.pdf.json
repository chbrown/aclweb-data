They apply the dependency parser described in Sagae and Tsujii (2007) to the tree representations. We note that this algorithm is not sufficient to produce trees in our case, where the input graphs are not necessarily acyclic. It does correspond roughly to our LONGEST-E DGE baseline, which removes the longest edge in cycles, in addition to flow reversal.","Sagae and Tsujii (2008) also present a shift-reduce automaton approach to parsing DAGs.

Pruning optimizes the number of “good” edges in trees (Section 3.1), while packing transforms graphs into trees by means of a pipeline of operations which are 99.6% reversible (see Figure 1); that is, almost no information from the original graphs is lost in the trees (Section 3.2).","Under both approaches, we first introduce artificial root nodes to the graphs and append them to the word list. Graphs may initially be disconnected. We connect all weakly connected components as follows. We first identify a most important node in each weakly connected component, which we will refer to as the root. This root is taken to be the first node with the “top” feature from the data, if one exists. If none exists, then the node with highest degree is chosen as the “root”. (Note that the “root” of each non-singleton connected component is marked as a “top” node in the inverse transformation.) The root of each non-singleton weakly connected component is attached as a dependent of the artificial root node with a special new label for the corresponding edge. Also, each disconnected node is attached as a dependent of the node to the right of it, with a distinct special new label. It is these connected graphs that we take to be the input in the following low, suggesting that maybe the decoding algorithm was tuned to a specific planarization of the complex graphs. 3","http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task8/ two subsections describing our graph pruning and packing algorithms. 3.1 Graph pruning Our PRUNING algorithm removes a small number of edges in the semantic graphs to be able to represent them as trees. The average edge counts from the training data (see Section 4.1) indicate that the potential edge loss in pruning is relatively small (5.7% in the worst case). In this approach, two transformations on the connected semantic graphs are carried out: pruning and flow reversal. Pruning. The input digraph may contain underlying undirected cycles. We break these cycles by iteratively removing the longest edge from the node with the fewest predecessors (lowest depth) in the digraph. The resulting underlying undirected graph is a tree. Depth-first flow reversal. We then carry out depth-first traversal of the resulting underlying undirected tree, reversing the direction of edges from the leaves upwards, as needed, until reach-ing the root. Any reversed edge’s label is given a special prefix, so that this reversal can be undone in a post-processing step. Following the above two transformations, we train our parsers on the transformed semantic annotations and output graphs such as the one in Figure 1a. 3.2 Graph packing Our PACKING algorithm consists of a pipeline of four graph transformations. The two major transformations are for coordination and generalised long-distance dependencies, being both parallel path inducing constructions. The transformations are both linguistically and topologically inspired by the f-structure annotated c-structures in Lexical Functional Grammar and f-structure parsing via off-the-shelf dependency parsers (Schluter and Van Genabith, 2009). We further ensure the defin-ing tree property that every node is connected by a unique path from the root, by carrying out flow reversal when necessary. Finally remaining parallel paths are broken according to an heuristic on path locality. Coordination. In some semantic representations of coordination, individual conjunct nodes may all dominate a same argument, or be dominated by a same head. In both these cases, parallel paths are generated. The same structures may 214 a) b) c) Figure 1: Example of pruned (top), packed (middle), and original (bottom) semantic graph. (Sentence 22002004 from the PAS dataset.) be represented if the head or arguments are “factored out”. To do this, we remove all edges from conjuncts towards a same argument (resp. from a shared head to each conjunct), and introduce a new edge from the root of the coordination sub-tree towards this argument (resp. from a shared head to the root of the coordination subtree). The new edges receive a special prefix to facilitate applying the inverse transformation. Breadth-first flow reversal. Unlike our pruning algorithm, there is not yet any clear distinct path from the root to the all nodes (as there are not leaves yet). After carrying out the coordination transformation, we carry out a breadth-first search on the graph to direct flow away from the root, and again, reversed edges’ labels are given a special prefix. As we do this, we test resulting nodes to see if there are any parallel paths leading to them. If so, these paths may be transformed immediately according to the following transformation. Generalized long-distance dependencies. Long-distance dependencies are represented in f-structure annotated c-structures by path equations. This gives a tree representation of parallel paths, at least one of which is exactly one edge long. Given two parallel paths p1 and p2 in the graph, where p1 = (v1, l, vn) and p2 = (v1, l1, v2), (v2, l2, v3), . . . , (vn−1, ln−1, vn), we remove the last edge of p2 and augment p1’s label with the representation l1 : l2 : · · · : ln−1 of p2. p1 becomes (v1, l and l1 : l2 : · · · : ln−1, vn), indicating that vn is also the child (with dependency label ln−1) of the node found by travelling (from v1) down an l1 labelled edge, followed by an l2 labelled edge, and so on until the child of the ln−2 labelled edge is found. Maximum average locality heuristic. Following these transformations, there may still be parallel paths in the graph: those not parallel to a single edge. We remove “worst” re-entrant edges using the simple heuristic that the path with the lowest average edge span should be conserved entirely. These removed edges clearly cannot be recovered after transformation. Our parsers are trained on the output graphs of these four transformations such as the one in Figure 1b. We observe the main difference between PRUNING and PACKING: coordination and long-distance dependencies. For example, PACKING keeps the edge between the conjunction and the first conjunct, which is pruned away in PRUNING. Such a difference provides a partial explanation for the lower recall of PRUNING vis- à-vis P ACK-ING (see Section 4.5)."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Data","paragraphs":["The three datasets are semantic annotations of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank of English. The average sentence length, which is also the average number of dependency edges in the tree approximations that we use to induce our semantic parsers, is 22.93. The three semantic formalisms are slightly richer, and the average number of edges in the PAS-annotated treebank is 24.32. For DM, the average number of edges is 23.77, and for DM it is 23.33. While the pruning-based approaches thus suffers from a modest information loss, throwing out 5.7% of the edges in the worst 215 case, this is not the case for packing. The reversibility of the packed representations is given by the score upper bound in the last row in Table 1. We use the dataset splits of the SemEval 2014 shared task. 4.2 Model For both our pruning and packing models, we use the Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010)4","with default parameters to learn our parsing models. The Mate parser is trained on the output of the transformation pipeline on Sections 00-19 of the three semantically annotated WSJ datasets. Some models use Brown clusters generated from Sections 00-19 only. This does not solve OOV problems, but allows of slightly better generalisation across distributionally similar words in the training data. 4.3 Baselines We use the SemEval 2014 shared task baseline (SIMPLE-P RUNE; see Section 2), as well as the LONGEST-E DGE baseline, also mentioned above. The latter is our strongest baseline system. It is very similar to PRUNING, in doing both edge pruning and flow reversal, but the pruning step only removes the longest edge rather than considering node depth. Our third baseline is the Mate semantic role labeling learner (SRL-D EP) (Björkelund et al., 2009), which uses predicted syntactic parses as input; for this, we use the syntactic parses made available in the SemEval 2014 shared task for replicability.

This is not surprising, since our packed representations introduce new labels, making it harder to generalize at training time. On the other hand, pruning approaches suffer in recall, simply because edges are thrown away in preprocessing the data. 216"]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we experimented with using tree approximation algorithms to reduce semantic structures to trees and use off-the-shelf structured prediction techniques to train semantic parsers.
