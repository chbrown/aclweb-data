This electronic dictioua,y is supported by of a generic mullilingual dictiona,'y tc~l, ALEX. The problem is to keep as much :is ix~ssible of the logical loruL so as to allow logical access such as searching on multiple keys, sorting, etc. 3. Dictionary revision \"Crossing\" of the French-Euglish and English-Malay dictionaries has been made manually by people who were not lluent ill French. Thus, some errors remaiu in both the logical structure and in the content. These errors have 1o Ix: corrected before producing lhe final paper form of the FEM dictionary. 4. Phonetic codes conversion USM did not use the standard phonetic transcripticm (international phonetic alphabet - IPA), lint a local transcription using certain ch'u','lcters of Ihe Tilnes TM font, which looks like characters of the IPA. These characters have high ASCII code (128 to 256), thus this rendering is different according to the Ibm. To be portable to PC for instauce, the files must contain only lower ASCII characters (32 to 128)."]},{"title":"I!1. Methodology","paragraphs":["Our methodology is genetic enough to be applied to other projects dealing with the construction of real-size publishable human-oriented dictionaries. The methodology is based on the use of simple but powerful l{~ls. 1. Use of an editor for correcting errors The problem is to find an appropriale software for this work. The first type of software is databases but our experiences with them (we have used dBASE III and all)) show that lexicographers don't like to work through DataBase Management Systems. They want to use the same word processor tc~ see the texts they want to index and to construct the dictionary. The most practical tool would bc an edilor of structured documents like Grif (Andr6, Furuta & Quint 1989, Phan & Boiler 1992) which can manage the logical form of tile dictionary, llowever, such editors are complex Io learn and are not yet availal)le on micros as Ihey require lmge computing ressources. ]Ience, we use Word, a wklely awlilable com,ncrcial word processor. We approach this notkm of structured documents by using Word's \"styling\" facility. A Word style is a group of paragraph and characters format with a name (e.g. tile title of this section has the style 'Titlel' which includes tile information about the rendering of this lille). We associate a particul:lr style to each logical type o1\" infer,harlem in the dictionary.","aeeldent","/a ksidCff 11 .nl. accident kelnala n.e, an (kejadian) tidak sengaja kejadian) sec/~ra kebetuh!.n","accident de train/d'avion Irain/pl ane crash kenl;ihlllga n keretapl rialtos kalml terlmng","aeeklenl6","/a k'-;i d ~71tt q a. damaged (in an accident) r~sak (d'41am kemalanzan) hurt (in an accklent) tereedera (dalam kemalangan) (terrain) IllleVen tidak rata (kawas~,ll|, daerah) hilly berlmkit","Fig. 4 : an entry with styles 2. Use of an SLLP for converting formats To convert the initial norm:flizcd ASCII external fcmn (fig. 2) ill a printable form (llg. 3), we propose some solutions: 284 the first solution is In use Word's macro facility. Unfortunately, that facility is euly available on the PC version, and we lmmd it very clumsy to constantly exchange large files bctwcen the PC and the Macintosh, not speaking of unexpected chantcter W, msfonnafion in tim phonetic fent. the second solution is to use transducers, I)tfl the commercial Iranscriptors awtilable are only based OIL direct correspondences.

We used I:l\" (l;mgtmge of Transcriptions), a Specialized l.anguage for l,inguistic ProgrammiLlg for wrilting trallscriplors. LT transducers have one input tape with two reading heads (one standard head and one forward head) and one writing head. They can also handle wuiables and produce side effects.
