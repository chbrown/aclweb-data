In such a system a suitable phonetic pronunciation must be supplied, without human intervention, for every word in the text. No dictionary, however large, will contain all words, let alone proper names, technical terms and other textual items commonly found in unrestricted texts. Consequently, an automatic transcription components is usually considered essential. ttand-written rule sets, defining the transcription of a letter in its context to some sound, view the process as that of parsing with a context-sensitive grammar. This approach to transcription has been challenged more recently by a variety of methods such as Neural nets[2], Perceptrons[3], Markov Models[4], and Decision Trees[5]. Some approaches have used additional information such as prefixes and suffixes[8], syllable boundaries[3], sometimes combined with the use of parts-of-speech to assist in the disambiguation of multiple pronunciations. In the phonetic transcription of proper names special techniques can be employed to improve accuracy[9] such as detecting the language of origin of the name and using different spelling to sound rules. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational speed, complexity and cost. However, none of these methods by itself is completely adequate. The present method uses the two-step conversion process described elsewhere[i,3] in which the structure of the word plays a central role. First the orthographic word is divided into its syllables, and secondly the syllable sequence is converted to a phonetic string. This not only accords with linguistic intuition, but it also allows the two processes to be handled by different techniques, choosing the technique most suited to each step. The question of whether a"]},{"title":"moq)hological","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":",~yllabic","paragraphs":["decomposition of the word might produce better results is not thrther analysed here. (For the present study data was available for syllables and not for morphs, so in the sense the comparison could not be carried out by the techniques proposed). The effects of other factors, such as part-of speech tagging, domain-dependent information, and other information sources, were ignored, although these could be useful in practical systems. The technique proposed for syllabification is based on the principle of Hidden Markov Modelling, well known in speech recognition[7]. This presupposes the existence of some training material containing words in both their orthographic and syllabic tbrm. Using this data a model of syllable sequences can be designed and trained to identit~y syllable boundaries. Once the most likely syllable division of the word has been tbund the phonetic transcription can be produced by a variety of direct transcription methods, such as the one used here based on Decision"]},{"title":"Trees[5].","paragraphs":["The training of such a method presupposes the existence of some training data containing words in both their syllabic and phonetic forms. Using the latter data a Decision Tree can be trained to transcribe syllables in context into phone sequences. The advantage of using decision trees is that they not only learn general rules, but also capture idiosyncratic special cases automatically. The resulting process should perform transcription with high accuracy. Such a two-stage approach has been shown to yield improvements[3] but only where perfect syllabification information is available, consequently a reliable syllabification technique is required. The remainder of this paper 1279 discusses only the syllabification process in detail, since the decision tree methodology is well described elsewhere[5], whereas the syllabification algorithm proposed is novel. An experiment using a very large set of word-syllable-pronunciation strings was used to train the two models, and then tests performed to determine the accuracy of the resulting transcription.

We need to discover the underlying sequence of states which gave rise to the observations. The complexity arises since the states and observations do not align in a simple way[l 1].

As described[ll] the original data was extracted from a type-setting tape in which the words were listed in the usual forms with abbreviations, run-ons, and other typographical devices. These were first regularised by a combination of human and programmed conversioned so that no difficulties were encountered in the current experiment. The word entries were then divided into training data (220,000 words) and test data (5,000 words) by randomly extracting words. It was observed that the 220,000 words in the training text were composed of sequences of syllables taken from a set of 27,000 unique syllable types. An initial estimate of the syllable bi-gram model can be directly computed by observation. This initial model was able to decode the training data with 96% accuracy and the test data with 89% accuracy. This indicates the requirement for a smoothing technique to generalise the parameters of the bi-gram syllable model. Such smoothing may reduce the accuracy of the model on the training data, but should improve it on the test data. A further 100,000 words, not previously seen in the dictionary, were obtained from a corpus of 100 million words of Newspaper articles (available on published CD ROM from the"]},{"title":"Guardian","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Independent","paragraphs":["newspapers). Numeric items, tbrmatting words, and other textual items not suitable for this test were omitted. Assuming that no new syllable types are required to model this data, the training procedure described above was used to adapt the initial statistics obtained by direct inspection. The performance of the model on the training text was 94% and on the test data 92%. This indicates that some generalisation had occurred which made the model less specific to the initial training text, but more robust on the test text. The affect of this syllable model on the overall pronunciation system is as follows: The basic decision tree transcription system when working directly from orthography to phonemes has a word correct accuracy of 86% on training text and 78% on test data. (the result for training data is not 100% as expected because of smoothing and other generalisations in the decision tree construction process). With the use of syllables as marked, and a new decision tree grown on the syllable marked training data, the overall system has a word accuracy rate of 92% on the training data and 89% on the test data. 1282 Conclusions A method of determining syllable boundaries has been shown. The method can be improved by the use of a tri-syllable model and by the use of more training data. Other extensions could be explored quite easily. The method does not find new syllable types. For this some type of unsupervised clustering method is required. The method leaves unsolved the treatment of unusual or idiosyncratic textual conventions, notations, and numeric information. It seems that rule-based techniques will still be needed. While the more serious question still to be answered for TTS systems lie elsewhere, for example in prosody[10], the inability of systems to perform transcription with high accuracy makes this still an open question. The problem of transcription is also of interest in Speech Recognition[6] where there is a need to generate phonetic baseforms of words which are included in the recognisers' vocabulary. In this case the work required to generate a pronouncing dictionary fbr a large vocabulary in a new domain, including many technical terms and new jargon not previously seen, calls tbr an automatic, rather than manual technique. In the wider context the method applied here is another example of self-organising methods applied to Natural Language Processing. While these methods have found a fundamental place in speech processing (for example, speech recognition) they have yet to be seriously adopted for language processing. It is a possibility that many more specific tasks in language processing may be amenable to treatment by self-organising methods, with a consequent improvement in the reliability and ease of replication of the NLP systems which incorporate them.
