Underspecifications can be caused by shortcomings of the component providing the input or by the prelhninary stal.e of incrementally given input. The paper Mms to escape from such dead-end situations by making ~ussumptions. We discuss global aspects of default handling. Two i~roblem classes for defaults in the incrementM syntactic gener;ttor VM-GEN are presented to substantiate our discussion. 1 MOTIVATION Natural Language Generation, i.e., the process of building an adequate utterance for some given content, is by nature a decision making problem (Appelt, 1985). Interna.1 decisions are made on the basis of the specified input. Unfortunately, input information can be insufficient in two respects:","• If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system, .qloba.l problems in producing svJ.Jicicnl inp't,t iuJ'orm.a.tio~, for the generator may occur, e.g., because o[' translation mismatches in inachine translation (Kameyama, 19!)1). In this case, the generator eitl,er has to use a default or formulat.e a request for clarification in order to be abh~ to continue its processing, i.e., to produce an utterance. During simultaneous interpret a.- tion requests are rather unusual. Ilere defaults allow for a sta.ndalone handling of t:he problem. For example, problems during speech recognition of automatic interprel:a-tion can lead to results like, \"the (man/men) will come to the hotel tomorrow\". If the system is not able to give a preference for one of the alternatives, e.g., by evaluating context information, the generator has to choose","\"The author is eurrent, ly at NTT Network lurer mation Systems Laboratories (kikui((Nlttnly.ntt..i P). a probable number value on its own to complete verbalization.","• Furthermore, for incremental generation, the input information is produced and hande.d own' step by step, so that it can be tem-poraril 9 ineomplele -- although as a whole it may become sufficient. This behaviour of a generator is motiw, ted by psycholinguistic observa.tions which show that people~ start speaklug 1)e[bre all necessary linguistic material has been chosen (e.g., articulating a noun phrase be['ore, the dominating w'.rb is selected). As a consequence of undersl)ecification , incremental generation is essentially based on working with defaults, l'~lements are uttered before the processing or input consuml%ion has been finished. (Kita.no, 1990) gives an example for defaults in i:he context of simultaneous interpretation: In Japanese, negation is specified at the end of the sentence while in English, it has to be specified ill ['rent of the finite verb. Tllere[bre, during .lapanese-English translation, where analysis, l;ransfer, and general;ion are l)erformed in a para.llel and incremental way, the system has to commit, e.g., positive wdm', l~el'ore knowing the actual polarlty I.","Generally spea.kiug, dcfa.'ull h.andlin, g specities how processing, i.e., furthe,' decision-making, can contimu, witl~out sufficient input information.

Section 2 provides a geucral description for defaults iu generation emphasizing the specific requirements in an incremental system. After identifying the condi-tions under which defaults are triggered (set> tion 2.1), the application of a default (set> tion 2.2) and the delhfition of its descrilltioll (section 2.3) is outlined. The crucial case of removing defa.ults not coi,lcidiug; wil.h n(,wly arriving input in an incremental system is discussed in section 2.4.","In section 3, this mechanism is applic~l I.o the incremental sentence generator V M--(I EN. In tile beginning of the section, the basic <h'- sign of the sysi;em is outlined. Lator on, default handling is included and exemplified for two general cases.","In tile final section we summarize the main results of the paper, l,'urthermore, we discuss how default handling can I)e adapt¢'d to multilingual generatim~, as required by l:llc speech-to-speech translation system \\/I~I{.IL MOBIl, (Block et al., I!)92). 2 GENERAL DISCUSSION OF DEFAULTS In the literature of norl-incremental generation, the need for defaults is hardly ever taken into account. The conunon point of view restricts the iulmt to be sulIicient for generation (see, e.g., the Te:ct Slructure by (Meteer, 1990) for a syntactic generator). In incremental gm,eration, most authors agree on the necessity of using defaults (see, e.g., (l)e Smedt, 1990; Kitano, 1990; Ward, 1991)). Nevertheless, they do not in sufficient depth answer the question of how to guide the processes of default handling an(l repair wil;hin a generator. This I~roblem is the starting--point tbr the following considerations.","We assume tlm.t generation is a decision-- making process witll the aim o[' producing it phmsiMe ul:t(wance 1)ased on given information. As mentioned in section 1, there are cases where this I)rocess stops (caused by underspccifical.ioll of the input) before finishing its output.","We define a module named d@tv.l! handh:r which tries to resume the process by giv-ing advice to il;, i.e., by maldng assumptions about tile missing input specification. With respect to this task it is discussed 1. in whicll situations de.faults are applied (see section 2.1 ), 2. how default handling is integrated into a sb, st:cm (see sectiou 2.2), 3.

An incremental processing scheme allows for an increase of elficiency and flexibility, e.g., by making tlm analysis and general.ion l~rocesses of a system ['or simultane,- ous interl~ret, al:ion ow~rlap in Lime.

Excessive use of self-corrections or erroneous expressions should be avoided because they decrease"]},{"title":"intdligibility","paragraphs":["of the utterance. Obviously there is a trade-off between fluency and reliability: maximal reliability requires 'secure' decisions and theretbre leads to output delay. On the other hand, maximal fluency necessitates the use of assuml)tions and repair, respectively. 2.1 When to Trigger Default Handling We define as de.fa.~dt sit'ltatio~z the situation where a generation system has not yet finished the utterance but at the same t;ime has consumed all given iul)ut and is not ahle to continue processing. In non-incremental gel> eration, this corresponds to the fact that the input lacks necessary informatiou, because the entire input is assumed to be given at one time (e.g., the undecidable number wdue of the example described in section 1 ). Thus, default handling should be triggered inunediately.","In incremental generation, however, tile system may gel; a new piece of infBrmation lai:er on that enables it to continue processing (e.g., the specification of a negation wdue + as out-lined in the example in section 1). Tllerefore, possible alternatives are either to wait for the next inpnt or to trigger default handling. The former violates the fluency goal, the latter may violate the reliability goal. We propose the explicit use of time-limits .lot delay intervals 4 .","=Ilumans often fill such pauses with filler.s like %r\" or \"what shall I say\".","aSometimes, correct, ion is mmeeessary il' (I.he speaker believes that) the hearer ean inl>r t.he intend-ed utterance from errol~eous speech.","4An explicit parameter expressing tile desired degree of fluency influences the time--limit.s.","Furthermore, the certainty of a &fault is described by a value. As soon aM a default situation is identified, the certainty of the default is checked to see whether it exceeds a predefined threshold that: determines the degree of fluency/relia.bility r'.","l'.;ach application o1\" a default decreases the global certainty o[' the system's state. Consequently, there should be a limit Jbr the mnzireal n'~,mbcr of dcfoults apl)licable to the same sentence. 2.2 How to Integrate Default Handling Basically, there are two strategies to integrate default handling into ongoing processing.","])efanlts may be handled in a way that dif- [>rs from the 'normal' processing of the system, e.g., as short-cuts.
