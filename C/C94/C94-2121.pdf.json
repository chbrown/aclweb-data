Moreover, her word sense disambignation method based on lexical cohesion is not evaluated fully.","In section two we outline what lexical cohesion is.

In the universe that continues expancb ing, a number of stars have appeared aml disappeared again and again. And about ten billion years after tile birth of the universe, in the same way as the other stars, a primitive galaxy was formed with the primitive sun as the center. Words {nniverse, star, universe, star, galaxy, sun} seem to be semantically same or related to each other and they are included in the same category in Roget's International Thesaurus. Like Morris and tIirst, we compute such sequences of related words(lexical chains) by using a thesaurus as the knowledge base to take into account not only the repetition of the same word but the use of superordinates, subordinates, and synonyms.","We. use a Japanese thesaurus 'Bnnruigoihyo'[1]. Bunrui-goihyo has a similar organization to Roger's: it consists of 798 categories and has a hierarchical structure above this level. For each word, a list of category numbers which corresponds to its multiple word senses is given. We count a sequence of words which are included in the same category as a lexical chain. It might be (:lear that this task is computationally trivial. Note that we regard only a sequence of words in the same category as a lexical chain, rather than using the complete Morris and Hirst's framework with five types of thesaural relations.","The word sense of a word can be determined in its context. For example, in the context {universe, star, universe, star, galaxy, sun}, the word 'earth' has a 'planet' sense, not a 'ground' one. As clear from this example, lexical chains ('an be used as a contextual aid to resolve word sense ambiguity[10]. In the generation process of lexical chains, by choosing the lexical chain that the current word is added to, its word sense is determined. Thus, we regard word sense disambiguation as selecting the most likely category number of the thesaurus, as similar to [16].","l';arlier we proposed incremental disambiguation method that uses intrasentential information, such as selectional restrictions and case frames[l 2]. In the next section, we describe incremental disambiguation method that uses lexical chains as intersentential(contextual) information."]},{"title":"3 Generation of Lexical Chains","paragraphs":["In the last section, we showed that lexical chains carl play a role of local context, t]owever, multiple lexical chains might cooccur in portions of a text and they might vary in their plausibility as local context. For this reason, for lexical chains to function truly as local context, it is necessary to arrange them in the order of the salience that indicates the degree of tile plausibility. We base the salience on the following two factors: the recency and the length. The more recently updated chains are considered to be the more activated context in the neighborhood and are given more salience. The longer chains are considered to be more about the topic in the neighborhood and are given more salience.","By checking lexical cohesion between the cu> rent word and lexical chains in the order of the salience, the lexical chain that is selected to add the current word determines its word sense and plays a role of local context.","Based on this idea, incremental generation of 756 lexical chains realizes incremental word sense disambiguation using contextual information that lexical chains reveal. During the generation of lexical chains, their salience is also in crementally updated. We think incremental disambiguation[9] is a better strategy, because a combinatorial explosion of the number of to tal ambiguities rnight occur if ambiguity in not resolved as early as possible during the analyt ical process. Moreover, incremental word sense disarnbiguation is indist)ensable during the gem eration of lexical chains if lexical chains are used for incremental analysis, because tile word sense ambiguity might cause many undesirable lexical chains and they might degrade the performance, of the analysis(in this case, the disambignation itself). 3.1 The Algorithm First of all, a &~pauese text is automatically seg-- mented into a sequence of words 1)y the morphological analysis[l 1]. Ih-om tile result of the |norphological analysis, candidate words are selected to inch.lde in lexical chains. We consider only nouns, verbs, and adjectives, with sonte excep lions such as nouns in adverbial use and verbs in postpositional use.","Next lexical chains are formed. Lexical cohesion among candidate words inside a sentence is first; checked by using the thesaurus. Ilere the word sense of the current w/)rd might be determined. This preference for lexica.1 cohesion inside a sentence over the intersentential one retlects our observation that the former nfight be tighter.","After the analysis htside a sentence, i:audidate words are tried to be added to one of the lexieal chains that are recorded in the register in the order of the above salience. The ih'st chain that the current word has tile lexica] cohesion relation is selected. The salience of the selected lexical chain gets higher and then the arrangement in the register is updated.","Here not ()lily the word sense amt)iguity of the current word is resolved but the word sense of the amt)iguous words in the selected ]exica[ chain cau also be determined. Because the lexical chain gets higher salience, other word senses of the mnhigu ous words in the lexic~d chain whi/-h correspond to other lexical chains can he rejected. There fore,, lcxica] chains can be used riot only a.s prior context but, also later context for word seuse disambiguation.","If a candidate word can not be added to the existing lexical chain, new lexieal chains for each word sense are recorded in the register.","As clear fl'om tile algorithm, rather than the truly incremental method where the register of lexical chains is updated word by word in a sentenee, we adopt the incremental method where updates are performed at the end of each sentence because we regard intrasentential information as more iml)ortant.","The process of word sense disambiguation using lexical chains is illustrated in Figure 1. The most salient lexical chain is located at the top in the register. In the initial state the word W1 re-- utains aml)iguous. When tile current unambigu-ous word W2 is added, tile chain b is selected(top left). The chain b t)ecomes the most salient(topright).

Of course these results are unsatisfactory, but we think this measure for segment boundaries is promising and useful as a preliminary one.","Since lexical chains are considered to be different in their degree of contribution to segment boundaries, we arc now refining the measure by taking into account their importance. We base the importance of lexical chains on the following two factors:","1. The lexical chains that include more words with topical marker 'wa' get more importance.","2. The longer lexical chains tend to represent a semantic unit and get more importance. The start and end points of the more important lexical chains can get the more boundary strength. This refinement of the measure is in the process and yields a certain extent of improvement of the system's performance.","Moreover, this ewduation method is not necessarily adequate since partitioning into a larger number of smaller segments might be possible and be necessary for the given texts. And so we will have to consider the evaluation method that the agreement with hmnan subjects is tested in future. Ilowever, since human subjects do not always agree with each other on segmentation[6, 4, 14], our evaluation method using the texts in the questions with model answers is considered to be a good simplification.","Several other methods to text segmentation have been proposed. Kozima[7] and Youmans[17] proposed statistical measures(they are named LCP and VMP respectively), which indicate the plausibility of text points as a segment boundary. Their hills or valleys tend to indicate segment boundaries. However, they only showed the correlation between their measures and segment boundaries by their intuil, ive analysis of few sample texts, and so we cannot compare our system's and their performance precisely.","ltearst[5] independently proposes a similar measure for text segmentation and evaluates the performance o[ her method with precision and recall rates.
