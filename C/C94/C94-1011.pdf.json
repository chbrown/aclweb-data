It has heen liointed out by many users that one of the most annoying things idmtlt MT sys-- terns is tim repeated occurrence of identical errors in word sense and attachment dlsambiguation. We show the limitations of a conventional user-dictionary method and explain how our approach solves the prol/lem. 1. Introduction","In the last decal% more and more commercia.l machine translation (MT) systems have lmcome available for a wide variety (if languag, e Iiairs. An MT system is a very handy tool: trot one quickly Iinds out thai, it Irlakes tt, e same errors over and over again even if a user dictionary is carefully maintained. There are sew, ral re;mons for such repeated errors.","1. Commercial MT systems are not tmilt in actor dance with a powerful h;xical semantic formalism. The user dictionary alone cannot (llsamlfiguate word senses and phrasal icttitelimei/ts satisNmtorily.","2. MT systems cannot handle the domain and context dei)endency of word sm,se, ph rasal atl, aeh men L an d word selection.","3. In a shared environment, each user has a differ-. ent user dictionary, and must therefore redumhmtly correct the same errors ms all the other users. A powerful lexieal semantic apl)roaeh [s] couhl give more accurate translatiml~ but it might be. too Inuch to ask users to develop their dictionaries within that formalism. Tl, e simple structure of a user dieti(mary also restricts the learning ability of M'r systems during the post-editing process. The second of the almw~ re;kstms tl~ motivated recent exanlple-ba~ed and case-b~med machine translation re.search [9, s, 10]. However, a method for finding the best-matehlng eases hi a cime. base., where cases (or exalnples) are collected from different dmna.ins or contexts~ has not been studied well. Nor is it kllown whether considering the frequency of eases gives a better result. The third reason is rarely <liscussed> hut it is riot desirable sirnply to share a single user dictionary, since the dictionary may become inconsistent by reflect-ing multil>le users' updates. McRoy [s] discussed word sense disambiguation using multlph; knowledge sources, but her method is still dictionary-b~med. Some of the eoolmerclal systems for human-aided trailslatlm h such as the Translation Manager/2 [~1~ can provide the user with nmre Ilexible access to multilile dictionaries and the Iranslation memory (a repository of pairs of smlrce and target sentences). This organization of knowledge cmdd lie quite useful for selecting correct transhttlons of vvords~ lint the types of knowledge awdlable from the dictionaries and translation memo. ries are rather limited> and are certainly not enough for resolving strueturaJ ambiguities in sentences.","In this paper, we propose Porhtble Knowledge Sources (PKSs) for machine translatlou. A PKS consists of preference infi~rmatitm on word sense, l)hrasal attachment, and word selection for translation. It is acquired through user lift.erection in the post-editing process, and is stored with the document being translated. When translating a document by using an Mq' system, a user can specify a llst (if already-translated documents, and the system will ma.ke use of the PKSs included in the specilied documents. We show how Sltch a collectimt of I)KSs is organized, used for translation~ and integrated into a user dictionary, and how the problem stated aliow~ can he solved by using PKSs. 2. Portable Knowledge Sources","A Portabh~ Knowledge Source (PKS) consists of preference infornlation on three kinds of ambiguity: 1. Word sense 2. Phrasal attachelnent 3.
