Some of the basic principles which have evolved from this research may be summarized ~m follows.","(1) The most adequate scheme for simulating human translation ~ctlvity is doubtless the transfer one.","(2) The level of transfer and the volume of structural and semantic information explicitly represented at this level should be determined experimentally as a compromise between the demands for translation adequacy under the given conditions and the advantages of \"shortcuts\" permitted by the superficial correspondences between the languages concerned.","(3) Semantics is not in itself a level of linguistic representation, but rather part of linguistic description at any level of representation of linguistic units.","(4) In its semantic aspects, syntax is dependent on lexicon to a greater extent than vice versa.","(5) A model aimed at faithful simulation of linguistic performance should make explicit use of the factor of linguistic normativity, this being, at least in prospect~ a building block for \"self-tuning\" functions as an analogue for human learning capabilities.","An approach best suited for effectuating these principles seeirm to be that of relying on a lexiconoriented lingware framework of a special kind. Within this framework, eTttrles of a uIfiform structure may be provided, besides lexlcal units, also for morphological categories, fanctlon elements (inchdlug punctuation), and all kinds of grammatical features, while syntagmatics of all levels may be presented in terms of valencies of those levels, assigned to the corresponding lexical or grasmn.atlca] units in their entries.","The JaFtAP experimental system is meaatt to in-corporate this approach.","In ~cordance with the transfer scheme of translation, the system is made up of three major components: the Japanese analysis component, the Japanesc-Rl~ssian transfer component, and the Russian synthesis (generation) component. It is implemented on IBM PC, MS DOS, its programming tools being Arity Prolog for analysis and traamfer~ and Turbo Pascal for synthesis."]},{"title":"2 The current version of the JaRAP system","paragraphs":["At present, the JaRAP system does not go far beyond the i~fitial lexico-morphological level of text processing (though some provision has already been made for further stages of its development - see See.3).","The analysis component of the system performs so far three main groups of operations: segmentation of the input Japanese texts into graphico-morphological (CAM-) elements (stems aJtd suffixes of Japanese words); processing s] tranMationally idiomatic (TI-) csm6inatisns of GM-elements; and lezieo-rnsrpholofical (LM-) analy~i.¢ of the resulting sequence of (]M-elements aatd the_Jr TLeomblnations.","Segmentation is accomplished in two steps. First, the input text (= the input sequence of k~na and kanjl kodes) is broken up into fragments by conteztual delimiters eertMn to denote word or morph boundaries (e.g., punctuation marks, the occurrence of a k~tat~na symbol after a hlragana one or vice verB% etc,). Then the fragmgnts obtained are segmented into GM-elements by mea~ts of dictionary 1/2 search. The resulting GM-elements are represented by the reference numbers loc~tlng their dictionary entries in the database used. For segmentatimtally ambiguous fragments, all possible segmentations are formed. If dictionary search is unsuccessful, the program draws oa ant auxiliary index of separate graphic symbols, so that \"unknown\" words can still be processed (nard if they axe composed of \"kaatjl, be even provided later on with a traatslatlon of sorts).","The processing of TI combinations of GMdements is partly necessitated by the fact that fragment boundaa'ies may sometimes sepszate the components of a. eornpottnd word~ llke so that these compoitents have then to be joined to-gether by a special procedure. The saane procedure is used to locate multl-word comblaatloits similar to tingle GM-elements in that they have idioms.tic translatlons ~nd do not allow of variations in their htternal structure (this is often he case with terminological expressions). TI-combint~tlons axe searched for as sequences of reference numbers identifying the GM-elements they ~e composed of. When. found, they are replaced each by a single reference number - thu.t of the entry for the TI-combinatlon as a whole, ~.nd are subsequently treated in the sumac way as individual GM-elements (with some reservations mentioned in See.3).","LM-analysls of a sequence of GM-elements examines, for eazh of them, all of its alterna.tive lexico-morphological interpretations, or LM-elements contanned in its entry, with the aim of integnging the LM-elements corresponding to adjacent GM-elements into accepta.ble morphologtlcsl (M-) representations of Japnmese word-forms. The acceptzdfillty of these is established by checldng each M-representa-tion, as somt as it is formed, for the co-occurrmtce restrk:- tions its elements may impose on eax:h other t~nd oft the elements of its immediate eoittextual neighbours. Tlfis also serves for disaznbiguation, as all the LM-elements that cannot be used to form a.n acceptable M-represent~rtion of a word-form in the given sequence of GM-elements, are filtered out.","To optimize processing where aiterna.tive pa.ths of analysis are concerited, all analysis procedure, a.re orga.nlzed so as to lhnit sep~r~tte processing of such alternatives only to the subpatht; responsible for the ditferences between them. If some subp,~th is the same in two or more of the alternative axtalyses, it i~ processed just once, and the result is used for all the corresponding Mteraatives.","The bulk of the morphologleal deserlptlon nsed in LM-analysis is of a valeney-~ased type (an exceptioa being the morphonologica] - or, r~ther~ morphographical - alternations: t.he 10 metarnles representing such altentations are incorpor~Lted in the segmentation procedure). The morphological valencies are mostly assigned to suffixes, while stems (verbal or axL jecfival) ~t as fillers. The co-occurrence restrictions imposed by the eh'.ments of ~ word-forra on those of its adjax:ent word-forms are described in much. the same way (the only difference bei]tg that irt this ca~e the data. to be checked is assigned to stems at least ~L8 often as to sufi'ixes). This helps to mt~ke wordbonnda.ries tra-nspa.rent, if necessa-ry, to morphological valencies, so that the borderline between morphology a.nd syntax loses something of its tradltlona] r~ghtity.","Transfer operatioss s.t I, he lexico-morphologlcal level ~tre limited ~Lt present to those of repbLcing tit<.* elements of the Jn.panese M-representation obtained from analysis, by their Russian equivMents, aatd shifting, where necessaxy, the ttussi~n morphological categories that msy appear a~ a result of such replaxeemeat, from the positions they initially occur in to tkeir appropriate word-forms. Sometimes this in-volves skipping a. uumber of intermediate elements, such as a.uxilia.rles, brackets, etc.","Besides lexieo-morphological transfer, we ha.re by now implemented some very simple synts.cfieal a.n~ysis-and-trv.nsfer opers.tions based on the most general correspondences betwemt Japanese and Runsian structura.l and word-order information. This is oitly the very first step to the synta~ctlea] tr~itsfer component we are planning, but the operttt]ons implemented ~re already suttleient to provide a,tcquate l:tusslan translations for Japanese sentences containlag no embedded clauses, lexie,'d ~mbiguities, or other difficult linguistic phenomenu.

The environment built for this purpose is called VOCOPS (\"VOCabulary updating OPtionS\").","The VOCOPS environment allows the user to add, delete or replace all types of dlction~ry entries or zones within them in a highly interactive mode. VOCOPS checks the updating information for its for-real accuracy and for its compatibility with the information already contained in the current databa.se. It then proceeds to waxn the user of those con-sequence~ of lds updating operations which other-wise might have been overlooked, and to indicate the in~cur~ies or inconsistencies detected. If possible, it also suggests the likely ways of their correction. Among other things, VOCOPS keeps watch on the correspondence between the entries for individual GM- (and LM-) elements ~d those for their TI-combinatlons. E.g., if the user wishes to delete a GM-element which forms pazt of some of the TI-combinations present in the database, VOCOPS lists these with a warning that they will also be deleted.","The Russian synthesis component is co~lstrutted as an independent subsystem, cornplete with a database of its own. Its functions include both morphological generation and some tmpecta of syntactic processing. Here we will not discuss it an any length, because there is ~ sepaxate paper devoted entirely to this component (Kanovich,ShaJyapintr,199.1)."]},{"title":"3 Development work under way","paragraphs":["Implementing the most basic (however simple) of the linguistic functions needed in translatior h the current version of the Jal'tAP system constitutes the necessary foundation for further developments.
