Nearly any element can take the one position preceding the verb in V'2, ,-ailed the. Vo~J'd~t (\"p,'e-(verbal)field'). Normally a thematic element is placed into the Vorfeld. According to IIoberg's (1.981) analysis of the Mannheimer l)'uden Korpus, in 63% of al[ V2 sentences the nominative complement (sub jet6) takes this place. A convenient way of seeing it is that all elements fol|ow the. verb in V2 position according to tile CF, and that one (thematic) element is moved int;o the Vorfeld position. We suggest that if the analysis of the source language fails to recognise the theme of the sentence, the subject takes this place.","In our model, most elements can cith(,r I)e thematic, rhematic, or neutral (i.e. unnmrked with respect to theme and theme). Sent(?nce variations as different as shown in the examples 5a to 5d can be generated using tim canonical form presented above, depending on t;he parameterisation of the features theme, rheme and focus for the different constituents. The order of elements in 5a corresponds to the defaull, order. Itowever, the same order would be general;ed if the personal pronoun was marked as being thematic, and/or if the adverb gest.ern was rhematic. We put the information -t-theme in 5a to 5e in brackets to indicate that this feaLm'e is not a requirement to generate I,he respect;ire word orders.

The genera.l principle is that focussing constru(;t;ions a.re relatively unlil(ely to occur ill written text, and therefore one should avoid the an~dysis involving focus when another analysis is possible. This is the case when the analysis of the PP as an adjunct results in a sentence without toni, restive stress.","13a Er sollte ni('ht eherus kommen.

The fact; thi~t most;, hut not all, constituent orders are possible, an(1 that some 74 orders are more n,~tura[ than others poses a considerable problem for NI,P.","In this paper, we presented a method t,o deal with these problems from the analysis and l;he generation point of view. Concerning analysis, the znMn idc~ is (.hat single sentences reflect the theme-rheme structure irnpos(,d l)y the context, so that thematic, rhcmatic and (contrastivcly) focussed constituents can often I)e recognised, in generation, wc can convey gills knowledge, by diN'.ring word order depending on the context.
