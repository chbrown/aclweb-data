Unlike previous work on connection,st morphology (e.g., MacWhinney ~5 Leinbaeh (1991), Plunker, & Marehman (1991) and Rumelhart & MeClelland (1986)), the focus of this paper is receptive nmrphology, which represents the more fundamental, or at least the earlier, process, one which productive nmrphology presumably buihls on.","The task of learning receptive morphology is viewed here ,as follows.

In this paper, two versions of the model are described. Version 1 successfidly learns simple exampies of all of tile morl)hological rules except reduplication and circumfixation, but its l)erformance is far from the level that might be exl)ected frmn a human language learner.

Words are often recognized hmg before they finish; hearers seem to be continuously coml)ariug the contents of at linguistic short-term memory with the phonological representations ill their mental lexicons (Marsk, n-Wilson & Tyler, 1980). Thus tile task at hand requires a short-term memory of some sort. There are several ways of represent-ing short-term memory in cmmectionist networks (Port, 1990), in particular, through the use of time-delay connections out of input units and through the use of recurrent time-delay cmmections on some of the network units. The most ttexible apl)roach makes use of recurrent connections on hidden units, though the arguments ill favor of this opthm are beyond the scope of this l)aper. The model to be described here is a network of this type, a version of the simple recurrent network due to Elman (1990). Version 1 The Version 1 network is shown in Figure 1. Each box represents a layer of connectionist processing units and each arrow a cmnplete set of weighted connections between two layers. The network operates as follows. A sequence of l)hanes is presented to the input layer one at a time. Tl,at is, each tick of the network's chick represents the presentation of ~t single phone. Each l)hone unit represents a llhonetic fi~ature, and each word consists of a sequence of i)hones l)reeede(l by a boundary \"phone\" made. up of 0.0 actiwttlons."]},{"title":"\"1 root ~)inflection","paragraphs":[":: ====================================== I\"il~ure 1: Network for Acquisition of Morphology (Version 1) An input phone 1)attern sm,ds actiwttion to tile network's hidden layer. The 1,idden layer also receives activation from the pattern that apl)eared there on the l)revious time stel). Thus each hidden unit is joined by a time-deh W connection to each other hidden unit. It is the previous hidde,>layer pattern which represents the system's short-term memory. Because the hi(ldcn layer has access to this previous state, which in turn del)ended on its state al. the time step before that, there is no absolute limit to the. length of the context stare(1 in the sho,'t-term memory. At the 1)eginnlng of each word sequence, the. hidden layer is reinitialized to a pattern consisting of 0.0 activations.","l:'inally the output re,its are activated l)y the hidden layer. There are three output layers. One represe.nts simply a copy of the current input l)hone. Training the network to auto-associate its current input aids in learning the root and inflection identification task because it forces the network to learn to distinguish the individual phones at the hidden layer, a prerequisite to using the short-term memory effectively. The second layer of output uvits rel)resents the root \",neavlng\". For each root there is a single outlmt unit. Thus while there is no real semantics, the association between the inl)ut phone sequence and the \"meaning\" is at least an arl)itrary 215 one. The third group of output units represents the inflection \"meaning\". Again there is a unit for each separate inflection. For each input phone, the network receives it target consisting of the correct phone, root, and inflection outputs for the current word. The phone target is identicM to the input phone. The root and inflection targets, which are constant throughout the presentation of a word, are the patterns associated with the root and inflection for the input word. The network is trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm (Rumelhart, IIinton, & Williams, 1986), which adjusts the weights on all of the network's connections in such a way as to minimize the error, that is, the difference between the network's outputs and the targets. For each morphological rule, a separate network is trained on a subset of the possible combinations of root and inflection. At various points during training, the network is tested on unfamiliar words, that is, novel combinations of roots and inflections. The performance of the network is the percentage of the test roots and inflections for which its output is correct at the end of each word sequence when it has enough information to identify both root and inflection. A \"correct\" output is one which is ch>ser to the appropriate target than to any of the others.","In all of the experiments reported on here, the stimuli presented to the network consisted of words in an artificial language. The phoneme inventory of the language was made up 19 phones (24 h)r the mutation rule, which nasalizes vowels). For each morphological rule, there were 30 roots, 15 each of CVC and CVCVC patterns of phones.

Note that chance perforrnance for the roots was .033 and for the. iufiections .5 sluce there were 30 roots and '2. inflections. There are several things to notice in these results. Except for root identification for the eircum-fix rule, the network performs well above cllance. IIowever, the results are still disappointing in many cases. In particular, note the poor performance ou root identification for the prefix rule and inflection identification for the sufHx rule. The 1)chavior is much poorer than we might expect from a child learning these relatively simple rules. The problem, it turns out, is interference between the two tasks which the network is faced with. On the one hand, it must pay attention to infornmtion which is relcwtnt to root identification, on the other, to information relevant to inflection identification. This means making use of the network's short-term memory in very different ways. Consider the prefixing case, fl)r example. Here for inflection identification, the network need only pay\" attention to the first phone and then remelnber it until the end of the sequence is reached, ignoring all of the phones which appear in between. For root identification, however, the network does best if it ignores the initial phone in the sequence anti then pays careful attention to each of the following phones.","hleally the network's lfidden layer would divide into modules, one dedicated to root identification, the other to inflection identificatlon. This could happen if some of the recurrent hidden-unit weights and some of the weights on hidden-to-output connections went to 0. tIowcver, ordinary backpropagation tends to implement sharing among hidden-layer units: each hidden-layer unit participates to some extent in activating all output units. When there arc conflicting output tasks, as in this ease, there are two sorts of possible consequences: either performance on both t~sks is mediocre, or the simpler task comes to dominate the hidden layer, yielding good performaacc on that task and poor performance on the other. In the Version 1 results shown in Figure 2, we see both sorts of outcomes.","What is apparently needed is modularity at the hidden-layer level. One sort of modularity is hardwired into the network's architecture in Version 2 of the model, described in the next section. Version 2 ]]ccause root and inflection i<lentitication make contlicting demands on the network's short-term memory, it is predicted that performance will improve with scparate hid<len layers for the two tasks. Various degrees of modolarity are possible in connectionist networks; the form implemcllted in Version 2 of the model is total modularity, coml)letely separate networks h>r the two tasks.

There are now two hidden-layer mo<lules, each with recurrent connections only to milts within the same module and with connections to one of the two output identification layers of units.

Note that the results for file two-prefix and two-suffix cases agree with those for the single-prefix and single-suffix cases respectively (Figure 2).

There has been considerable interest in the last few years in architectures which are endowed with modularity and learn to use the modularity to solve tasks which call for it. The architecture described by Jaeobs, Jordan, & 13arto (1991) is an example. In this approach there are connections from each modular hidden layer to all of the output units. In addition there are one or more gating networks whose function is to modulate the input to the ontpnt units from the hidden-layer modules. In the version of the architecture which is appropriate for domains such as the current one, there is a single gating unit responsible for the set of connections from each hidden nmdule to each output task gronl). The outl)uts of the modules are weighted by the outl)uts of the corresponding gating units to give the output of the entire system. The whole network is trained using backl)ropagation. For each of the niodules, the error is weighted by the vahle of the gating input as it is l>assed back to the modules. Thus each niodule adjusl;s its weights in such a way that the difference, between the system's output and the desired target is mininlized, and the extent to which a nio<htle's weights are change<l <leiden<Is on its contribution to the outl)ut. For the gating networks, the error function implcments coml)etition among the modules for each output task group. For our purposes, two further augmentations are required. First, we are dealing with recurrent networks, so we permit each of the modular hidden layers to see its own previous values in ad(lition to the current input, but not the l)revious values of the hidden layers of the other modules. Second, we are interested not only in competition among the modules for the output groups, but also in coml)etition among the outpnt groups for the modules. In particular, we would like to prevent the network from assigning a single module to all output tasks. 218 To achieve this, the error function is modified so that error is mi,fimized, all else l)eing equal, when the total of the outputs of all gating units dedicated to a single module is neither close to 0.0 nor close to the total number of output groups.

The connections ending in circles symbolize the emnpcfition between sets of gating units which is built into the error function for the network. Note that the gating units have no input connections. These units have only to learn a bias, which, once tile system is stable, h.'ads to a relatively constant outlmt.

Recall that tile most efficient patteru of connectivity in all cases was the one in which one of the two modules was sl,ared by the two affix identification tasks. Adaptive mmlular networks with two modules of 15 units each were trained on tile two-sufflx, two-prefix, and prefix-suffix tasks described in the last section. Following 120 epochs, the outputs of the six gating units fl)r the different modules were exanfined to determine how the modules were shared. The results were completely negative; the three possible ways of assigning the modules to the three identilication tasks occurred with approximately equal frequency. The prolfiem was that the inflection identilication tasks were so nmch easier than the root identilicatlon task that they claimed the two modules for themsclves early on, while neither module was strongly prefc,'red by the root task. q_'hus as often as not, the two inflections ended up assigned to dil['erent modules. To compensate for this, then, is it reasonable to give root identification some sort of advantage over i,dlection identitication? It is well-known that children begin to acquire lexlcal morphemes before they acquire grammatical morphemes. Among the reasons for this is llrobably the more abstract nature of the lncanings of the grammatical morphemes. In terms of the network's tasks, this relative difficulty wouhl translate into an inability to know what the inllee-tion targets would I)e fl>r particular inlmt patterns. Thus we couh[ m<>del it by (lelayi,lg training on the inltection identification task.","The exl)eriment with the adaptive modular networks was repeated, this tixne witl, the fl)llowing training regimen. Entire words (consisting of root and two at[ixes) were i)resented throughout training, lint for the first 80 epochs, the network saw targets for only the root identification task. That is, the connections into the output units for the two inilcctions were not altered during this plume. I-'of lowing the 80th epoch, by which time the network was well on its way to learning the roots, training on the inllections was introduced. This procedure was followed for the. two-sulfix, twoq)retix, and prelix-sul[ix tasks; 20 sel):trate networks were trained for each type. For the two-sutlix task, in all cases the network organized itself in the p,'cdicted way. That is, for all 20 networks one of the modnh.'s was associated mainly with the two intlectio,, output units and the other associatcd with the root output units. In the preilx-suflix case, however, the results were more equivocal. Only 12 out of 20 of the networks organized themselves in such a way that tile two intlecti(m tasks were shared by one module, while in the 8 other cases, one module w~s shared by the root and pretix identitication t~sks. Finally, in the two-pretlx case, all of the networks organized themselves ill Sllch a v,'ay that the root and the first pretix shared a module rather than in the apllarently more eillcient contlguration.","The ditt'erence is not surprising when we consider the nature of the advantage of the configuratioit 219 in which the two inflection identification tasks are shared 1)3, one module. For all three types of affixes, roots are identified better with this configuration. But this will have little effect on the way the network organizes itself becanse, following the 80th epoch when competition among tile three output tasks is introduced, one or the other of tile modules will already be firmly linked to the root output layer. At this point, the outcome will depend mainly on the competition between tlle two inflection identification t,'~sks for the two modules, the one already claimed for root identification and the one which is still unused. Thus we can expect this training regimen to settle on tl,e best configuration only when it makes a significant ditference for inflection, as opposed to root, identification. Since this difference was greater for tile two-suflix words than for the prefix-sufl]x words and virtually nonexistent for the two-prefix words, there is the. greatest preference in the two-suffix case for tile configuration in which the two inflection tasks are shared by a single module. It is also of interest that for tile prefix-suffix cruse, tile network never chose to share one module between the root and the suffix; this is easily the least efficient of the three configurations from the perspeetlve of inflection klentlficatlon.","Thus we are left with only a partial sohttion to tlle problem of how the modular architecture might arise in the first place. For circumstances in which the different sorts of modularity impinge on inflection identification, the adaptive api)roach can find the right configuration. When it is performance on root identification that makes the difference, how-ever, this api)roach has nothing to offer. Future work will also have to address what happens when there are more than two modules and/or more than two intlections in a word. CONCLUSIONS Early work applying connectimfist networks to high-level cognitive tasks often seemed based on the assumption that a single network wouhl l)e al)le to handle a wide range of phenomena. Increasingly, however, the emphasis is moving in the direction of special-l)urpose modules for subtasks which may eontlict with each other if handled by the same hardware (aacobs et al., 1991). These apl)roaches bring eonnectionist models somewhat more in line with tile symbolic models which they seek to replace. In this paper I have shown how tile ability of simple recurrent networks to extract \"structure in time\" (Ehnan, 1990) is enhanced by built-in modularity which I)ermits the recurrent hidden-unit connections to develop in ways which are suitable for the root and inflection identification tasks. Not(., that this modularity does not amount to endowing the network with the distlnctiml 1)etween root and affix because both modules take the entire sequence of phones as input, and the modularity is the same when tile rule being learned is one for which there are 11o affixes at all (mutation, for examph!).","Modular approaches, whether symbolic or connectionist, inevitably raise fllrther questions, how-ever. The modularity in the pre-wired version of MCNAM, which is reminiscent of the traditional separation of lexical and grammatical knowledge in linguistic models, assumes that the division of \"semantic\" outlmt units into lexical and grammatical categories has already l)een made. The adaptive version partially addresses tills shortcoming, lint it is only etfective in cases where modularity 1)cuefits inflection identification. Furthermore, it is still based on the assumption that the output is divided initially into groups rel)resenting separate compet-ing tasks.
