This work represents the first effort for parsing Turkish. Our implementation is based on Tomita's parser developed at Carnegie-Mellon University Center for Machine Translation. The grammar covers a substantial subset of Turkish including simple and complex sentences, and deals with a reasonable amount of word order freeness. The complex agglutinative morphology of Turkish lexical structures is handled using a separate two-level morphological analyzer. After a discussion of key relevant issues regarding Turkish grammar, we discuss aspects of our system and present results fi'om our implementatiou. Our initial results suggest that our system can parse about 82% of the sentences directly and almost all the remaining with very minor pre-editing. 1 INTRODUCTION As part of our ongoing work on the development of computational resources for natural language processing in Turkish we have undertakeu the development of a parser for Turkish using the lexical-functional grammar formalism, for use in a mtmber of applications. This work represents the first approach to the computational analysis of Turkish, though there have been a number of studies of Turkish syntax fi'om a linguistic perspective (e.g., [Meskill 1970]). Our implementation is based on Tomita's parser developed at Carnegie-Mellon University Center for Machine Translation [Musha et.al. 1988, Tomita 1987]. Our grammar covers a substantial subset of Turkish including simple and complex sentences, and deals with a reasonable amount of word order freeness.","Turkish has two characteristics that have to be taken into account: agglutinative morphology, and rather ti'ee word orde r with explicit case marking. We handle the rather complex agglutinative morphology of the Turkish lexical structures using a separate morphological processor based on the two-level paradigm [Evans 1990, Otlazer 1993] that we have integrated with the lexical-functional grammar parser. Word order freeness is dealt with by relaxing the order of phrases in the phrase structure parts of lexical-functional gramm.ai\" rule by means of generalized phrases.","IThis work was done as a part of the first author's M.Sc. degree work at the Department of Computer Engineering of Iqilkent University, Ankara, 06533 Turkey. 2 LEXICAL-FUNCTIONAL"]},{"title":"GRAMMAR","paragraphs":["Lexical-functional gramnmr (LFG) is a linguistic theory which fits nicely into computational approaches that use unification IShieber 1986]. A lexical-functional grammar assigns two levels of syntactic description to every sentence of a language: a constituent structure and a functional structure. Constituent structures (c-structures) characterize the phrase structure configurations as a conventional phrase structure tree, while surface grammatical functions such as subject, object, and adjuncts are represented in functional structure (f-structure), Because of space limitations we will not go into the details of the theory. One can refer to Kaplan and Bresnan [Kaplan and Bresnan 1982] for a thorough discussion of the LFG formalism. 3 TURKISH SYNTAX In this section, we would like to highlight two of the relevant key issues in Turkish grammar, namely highly inflected agglutinative morphology and free word order, and give a description of the structural classification of Turkish sentences that we deal with."]},{"title":"3.1 Morphology","paragraphs":["Turkish is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by productive affixations of derivational and inflectional suffixes to root words [Ottazer 1993]. This extensive use of suffixes causes morphological parsing of words to be rather complicated, and results iu ambiguous lexical interpretations in many cases. For example: (1) ~ocuklarl a. child+PLU+3SG-POSS his children b. child+3PL-POSS their child c. child+PLU+3PL-POSS their children d. child+PLU+ACC children (acc.)","Such ambiguity can sometimes be resolved at phrase and sentence levels by the help of agreement requireuletlts though this is not always possible:","(2a) Onlarm qocuklarl geldiler. it+PLU+GEN child+PLU cone+PAST","+3PL-POSS +3PL (Their children came.) 494 Table 1: Percentage of different word orders in Turkish.

(Their children came.) For example, in (2a) only the interpretation (l c) (i.e., :heir et,ihlren) is possible because:","• the agreement requirement between lhe modifier and the modified parts in a possessive compound norm eliminates (la). ~",",, the facts that gel (come) does not subcategorize for an accusative marked direct object, and that in Turkish the subject of a sentence must be nominative 3 elintinate lid).","• the agreement requirement between the subject and the verb of a sentence eliminates lib). 4 In (2b), both (l a) and (l c) are possible (his children, and their children, respectively) because the moditier of the possessive compound noun is It covert one: it may be either onun (his) or onlartn (their). The other two interpretations are eliminated due to the same reasons as in (2a). 3.2 Word Order If we concern ourselves with the typical order o[ constituents, Turkish can be characterized as being a subject - object-verb (SOV) language, though the data in Table 1 fiom Erguwmh [Erguwmh I979], shows that other orders for constituents are also common (especially in discourse). In Turkish it is not the position, but the case of a noun phrase that determines its grammatical function in the sei1tence. Consequently typical order of the constituents may change rather freely without affecting the grammaticality of a sentence. Due to various syntactic and pragmatic constraints, sentences with the non-typical orders are not","2The agreement of the modilier milSt be tim sanle as the Imssessivc ol the moditied wilh the exception that if the modilicr is third llerson phn'al the imssessive of the modilied may be third person singular.","31u Turkish, the nominative caste is IlUltl~lrkctl.","4In a \"turkish sentence, person leattu'es of Ihe subject and the veil) sbould be the sitllle.

In this way, multi-word constructs such as yapar yapmaz (do+AOR+3SG do+NEG+AOR+3SG) (as soon as (one) does (that)) where both lexical categories are verbal but the coml~ound construct is an adverb, can be handled, so can idiomatic constructs like yant stra (side+3SG-POSS row) (besides) where the flmction and semantics of the multi-word construct has nothing to do with the function and semantics of the constituent lexical tbrms.","• We are currently working on extending the subset of sentences dealt with in respect of structure.","• We are currently working on augmenting our lexicon with substantial lexical information and selectional restriction information to be used with an integrated on-tological database. 8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Carnegie-Mellon University, Center for Machine Translation for making awfilablc to us their LFG parsing system.
