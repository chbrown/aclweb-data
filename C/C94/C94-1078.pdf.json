[Shieber el al., 1990] proposed to define the 'head' constituent It of phrase with category a~ on semantic grounds: the semantic representations of h and z are identical. This puts a strong restriction on the shape of semantic analysis rules: one of the leaves must share its semantic form with the. root node. IIowever, there are composition rules for semantic representations which violate this restriction, e.g. tim schemata for the construction of Underspecified Discourse It,epresentatim, Structures (UI)ILSs) [l\"rank and Reyle, 1992] where, in general, the root of a tree is associated with a strictly larger semantic structure (,hal, a,ly of I, he leaves. Ill order to make at generation method available for grammars wl,ich do not follow the striet notion of a semantic head, a syntactic-head-driven generation algorithm is presented, which can be specialized to generate from UDRSs. In a second step, the method will be extended in order to handle the movement of (syntactic) heads in a logically well-defined manner.","The (tactical) generation proble.m is tim task to generate a string from a semantic representation according to the syntax-semantics-relation defined in a given grammar. Let's assume that the latter relation","*The research reported here has been funded by the Sonderforsclmngsbereidt 340 \"Sprachtheorctische GrmMlagen ffir die Computerllngulstik\", a project of the German National Science Foundation I)I,'G. is stated by pairs of trees. The left tree stages a local syntactic dependeacy, i.e. the dominance relation between a root node and a set of leaf nodes and the linear precedence relation among the leaves. The right tree defines the relation among the semantic representation of the root and the semantic representations of the leaves. We assume that there is a one-to-one map from the nonterminal leaf nodes of the (local) syntax tree on the le.af nodes of the. (locM) semantic deriw~tion tree. Example:","np vp NP VP","i","i","t","I",",_ _ _ 5_-55, .... If one assumes a pairwise linking from M't to right then the links between the two trees can be on,itted. Although such pairs of trees are reminiscent of synchronons trees in TAG's [Shieber and Schabes, 1991], they are simpler in wtrious ways, in particular because we will nol make use of the adjunction operM.ion later on. In essence, pairs of trees are just a graphical notation for what has been put forward as the 'rule-to-rule'-hypothesis, el'. [Gazdar el al., 1985], the fact that in the grammar each syntax rule is related with a semantic analysis rule. However, on the long run, the tree notation suggests a more general relation, e.g. more internal structure or additional, terminal leaf nodes in the local syntax tree.","An obvkms way to implement a generation procedure (see Fig.l) is to relate the inlmt semantics with the start symbol of the gramnuu\" and then to try to exl}and this node in a top-down manner accordiug to the rules specitied in tl,e grammar. This node expansion corresponds to an application of the (predicl)-rule in the following abstract specification of a Lop-down generator. Generation terminates successfully if all the leaf nodes are labeled with terminals (s.ucccss). The question is which method is used to nmke two, possibly complex symbols equal, l'~or the sake of simplicity, we assume that the open leaves at0 resp. X0 are matched by (feature) term unification with the corresponding mother nodes in the grammar rule. llowever, for the semantic form Xo, a decidable variant of higher order unification might be used instead, in order Lo inch, de the reduction of .\\-expressions.

If such a map is not feasible, this lexical entry is dropped.","We restrict the grammars to lexicalized ones. A grammar is lexiealized if for every local syntax tree there is at least one preterminal leaf, cf. [Sehabes and Waters, 1993]. Note that lexicalization does not affect the expressibility of the grammar [Bar-llillcl el al., 1960], [Schabes and Waters, 1993].

[Calder et al., 1989] (modulo the use of unary category transformation rules) which relies, in addition, on the symme-try of syntactic and semantic head. A syntactic-head-drlven generator for a kind of lexlcallzed grammars has been proposed independently by [Kay, 1993]. Another variant of a lexlcMized grammar by [Dymetman ctal., 1990] does not make use of the head-corner idea but rather corresponds to the top-down generation schema presented in Fig.1.
