It is the largest such system in terms of the iunount of knowledge it compris(~s. In this work, we are concerned with the li)llowing components o[' the ALT-J/E system: 1. The Semantic lliera.rchy, 2. The Semantic Dictionary, and 3. Tile Translation l{ules. We briefly describe each of these COmln)nents below. For more details al)out the AI,T-.I/E system, we refer the reader to [lkehara et M. 1989, Ikehara et al. 1990, ikehara et al. 1991].","As shown in l\"igam~ 1, the Semantic ltierarchy is it SOFt of colt(:el)t t}l(?SltllrtlS represented its it l;l'(?e structure in which each node is called a .SC'IIta'tttiC categolw, or a (:atego'l~9 R)r siml)licity. Edges in this structure represent \"is-a\" relations am(rag the categories. For example, \"Agents\" and \"P(!ople\" (see Figure 1) are both categories. Tile edge between these two (:at-egories indicates that any instance of \"l)eoph~ '' is also an instance of \"Agents\". The current version of ALT- .l/E's Semlmtic llierarchy is :12 levels (let, I) and has about 3000 nodes. The Semantic Dictionary maps (~it(:h .]~4pall('.sC IIOtlll to its aI)prol)riate SeItlalltic cRtcgories. For example, the Selilalltic D!ctionary states that the noun )~!:~ (niwatori), which meahs \"chicken\" OF \"h011\" ill English, is an instance of the categories \"Meat\" and \"Birds\".","The Translation Rules in AUI?-J/E associate Japanese patterns with English patterns. Currently, ALT-J/E uses roughly 10,000 of these rules.' As Figure 2 shows, each translation rule has a .]apanese fret - tern its its left-hand side and all English pattern as its right-hand side. For example, the first rule in this figure basically sltys that if the ,Japanese verb in a sentence is ~J'~ < (yaku), its subj('(:t is an instance of \"l)eople '', and its ol)ject is an instance of \"lh'ead\" or \"Cake\", then the following English pattern is to be llS(?d:"]},{"title":"Sub.jeer","paragraphs":["\"l)ake\" Obj(!ct.
