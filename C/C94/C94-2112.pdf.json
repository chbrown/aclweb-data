We discuss generally the role of type and sortal coercion operations in the selnantics, and specifically the conditions on the application of coercion in aspectual predicates and other contexts. We reply to some recent discussion regarding the use of coercion in the grammar, and show that type chang-ing operations are both useful and explanatory mechanisms for capturing linguistic and computatioiml gcll eraliza.tions."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently, work in computational semantics and lexical semantics has made an interesting shift. Motivated by a concern for lexical organization and global coherence in tl~e structure of the language lexicon, some researchers ha,w~ moved towards more expressive semantic descriptions ([16, 1, 5, 101), as well a.s more powerful methods of composition ([22, 3]).","Some, however, have expressed reservations a.s to the general applicability of type-changing operations such as coercion, as well as the notion of a generative lexicon itself ([7]). In this pa.per, we address these c.riticisms directly, and show that, upon closer examination of the data, these critiques either miss the. point or are not substan tiated by the data. Still, without a proper notion of constraints on coercion, there can indeed be overgeneration of forms a.nd interpretations in the semantics, and in fact, the notion of conditions on coercion has always been integral to the basic spirit of Generative Lexicon Theory (el'. [19]). The empirical study of the range and lim-its of type change and cocomposition operations in natural language is an essentia.l part of the research in formal smnantics. The advantages accompanying gelmrative mechanisnls and the characterization of languages as lmlymorphic in well-defined ways far outweight the explanatory in-adequacies inherent in traditional approaches to lexical design and semantic projection, what [22] have called word sense enumeration approaches."]},{"title":"2 Polymorphic Languages and Semantic Expressiveness","paragraphs":["We will a, ssulne s(3me geueraJ familiarity with the framework of generative lexicon theory, as out-lined in [16, 18, 1]. ~'e feel it is important, how-ever, to clarify the motivating principles and genera.l methodology behind SllCh work, since these points seem to be overlooked or misunderstood by some authors ([7]).","In order to help characterize the generative power of natura.l languages in terms of semantic expressiveness, it is natural to think in terms of senla.ntic systenls with increasing functional power, l:urthel'more, a nat u ra.I wa.y of Cal)tu ring this might be in terms of the type system which the gra.mmar refers to for its interl)retation. It has been argued elsewhere ([19, 20]), that there are reasons for describing how semantic systems fall on a hierarchy of increasing expressive power. It seems clear at this point that the current enumera.tiw ~. techniques for lexical description are too impoverished to adequately describe the richness of semantic da.ta, much less to explain either how word senses relate to one a.|tother or the creative use of wo,'ds i. ,,over ,:o.texts","llrieily, a. genera.tiw', lexicon can be characterized as a syste.nl involving at least the tbllowing four levels of re.presentations: Argument Strut 1;nre, Event Structul'e, Qnalia.
