Parsers using a grammar for written sentences cannot deal with spontaneous speech because in spontaneous speech there are phenomena that do not occur in written sentences. A grammar based on analysis of transcripts of dialogues was therefore developed. It has two distinctive features: it uses short units as input units instead of using sentences in grammars for written sentences, and it covers utterances including phrases peculiar to spontaneous speech. Since the grammar is an augmentation of a grammar for written sentences, it can also be used to analyze complex utterances. Incorporating the grammar into the distributed natural language processing model described elsewhere enables the handling of utterances including variety of phenomena peculiar to spontaneous speech. 1 INTRODUCTION Most dialogue understanding studies have focused on the mental states, plans, and intentions of the participants (Cohen et al., 1990). These studies have presumed that utterances can be analyzed syntactically and semantically and that the representation of the speech acts performed by those ntterances can be obtained. Spontaneonsly spoken utterances differ considerably from written sentences, however, so it is not possible to analyze them syntactically and semantically when using a grammar for written sentences.","Spontaneous speech, a sequence of spontaneously spoken utterances, can be distinguished from well-planned utterances like radio news and movie dialogues. Mnch effort has been put into incorporating grammatical information into speech mlderstanding (e.g., Hayes et el. (1986), Young et al. (1989), Okada (1991)), but because this work has focused on well-planned utterances, spontaneously spoken utterances have received little attention. This has partly been due to the lack of a grammar and processing technique that can be applied to spontaneous speech. Consequently, to attain an understanding of dialogues it is necessary to develop a way to analyze spontaneous speech syntactically and semantically. There are two approaches to developing this kind of analysis method: one is to develop a grammar and analysis method for spontaneous speech that do not depend on syntactic constraints as much as the conventional methods for written sentences do (Den, 1993), and the other is to augment the grammar used for written sentences and modify the conventional analysis method to deal with spontaneous speech. The former method would fail, however, when new information is conveyed in the utterances; that is, when the semantic characteristics of the dialogue topic are not known to the hearer. In such cases, even ill a dialogue, the syntactic constraints are nsed for understanding utterances. Because methods that disregard syntactic constraints would not work well in these kinds of cases, we took the latter approach.","We analyzed more than a hundred dialogue transcripts and classified the distinctive phenomena in spontaneous Japanese speech. To handle those phenomena, we develop a computational model called L'n-semble Model (Shimazu et al., 1993b), in which syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processing modules and modules that do combination of some or all of those processing analyze the input in i)arallel and in-dependently. Even if some of the modules are unable to analyze the input, the other modules still output their results. This mode] can handle various kinds of irregular expressions, such as case particle omission, inversions, and fragmentary expressions.","We also developed Grass-.] ( GT\"ammar for spontaneous speech in Japanese), which enables the syntactic and semantic processing modules of t~he Ensemble Model to deal with some of the phenomena peculiar to spontaneous speech. Since G~'ass-.] is an augmentation of a grammar used to analyze written sentences (Grat-J, Gr'ammar for lexts in Japanese), Crass-Y-based parsers can be used for syntactically complex utterances.","There are two distinctive features of' G~'ass-J. One is that its focus is on the short units in spontaneous speech, called utter'auce units. An utterance uniL instead of a sentence as in Gral-J is used as a grammatical category and is taken as the start symbol. A Grass-J-based parser takes an utterance unit as input and outputs the representation of the speech act (illoeutionary act) performed by the unit. The other distinctive feature is a focus on expressions peculiar to spontaneous speech, and here we explain how to augment (h'at-J so that it can handle them. Previous studies of spontaneous speech analysis have focused mainly on repairs and ellipses (Bear et el., 1992; l,anger, 1990; Nakatani & Hirschberg, 1993; Otsuka ~; Okada, 1992), rather than expressions peculiar to spontaneous speech.","This paper first describes Grat-J, and then classities distinctive phenomena in Japanese spontaneous speech.

(The hours we receive your requests, they are received 24 hours a day.) 3.2 Treatment of the Phenomena by the","Ensemble Model These kinds of phenomena can be handled by the Ensemble Model. As described in Section 1, the Ensemble Model has syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processing modnles and modules that; do combination of some or all of those proeessings to analyze the input in parallel and independently. Their output is unified, and even if some of the modules are unable to analyze the input, the other modules output their own resnlts. This makes the Ensemble Model robust. Moreover, even if some of the modules are nnable to analyze the input in real-time, the others output their results in real-time.","'['he Ensemble Model has been partially implemented, and Ensemble/Trio-I consists of syntactic, semantic, and syntactic-semantic modules, it can handle (p2) above as described in detail elsewhere (Shimazu et al., 1993b). Phenomena (p3) through (p6) can be partly handled by another implementation of the Ensemble Model: Ensemble/Quartet-1, which has pragmatic processing modnle as well as the three modules of Ensemble/'lMo-I. The pragmatic processing module uses plan and domain knowledge to handle not only well-structured sentences bnt also ill-structured sentences, such as those including inver sion and omission (Kognre et al., 1994).","To make the system more robust by enabling the syntactic and semantic processing modules to handle phenomena (pl) and (p3) through (p6), we in-corporated Grass-g into those modnles. Grass-J differs fl:om Grat-J in two ways: Grass-J has lexieal entries for expressions peculiar to spontaneous speech, so that it can handle (pl). And because sentence boundaries are not clear in spontaneous speech, it uses tile concept of utterance unit (Shimazu et al,, 1993a) instead of sentence. This allows it to handle phenomena (p3) through (p6). For example, an inverted sentence can be handled by decomposing it, at the point where the inversion occurs, into two utterance units.","Fig. 3 shown the architecture of Ensemble/Quartet-I. Each processing module is based on the bottomup (:hart analysis method (:Kay, 1980) and a disjunctive feature description unification method ealled constraint projection (Nakano, 1991).

Many studies,"]},{"title":"though,","paragraphs":["have shown that utterances are composed of short units (I,evelt, 1989: pp. 23-.24), that need not be sentences in written language. Grass-3 uses such units instead of sentences.","Consider, for example, Dialogue 1 in Fig. 4. Utterances 1 and 3 cannot be regarded as sentences in written language. Let us, however, consider 'hal' in Utterance 2. It expresses participant B's confirma-tion of the contents of Utterance 1. 2 Each utterance in Dialogue 1 can thus be considered to be a speech act (Shimazu et al., 1993a). These utterances are pro-- cessing nulls we call \"utlerance units. They are used in Grass-J instead of the sentences used in Grat-J. One feature of these units is that 'hal' can be. intel\\jected by the hearer at the end of the unit.","The boundaries for these units can be determined by using pauses, linguistic clues described in the next section, syntactic form, and so on. In using syntactic [brm to determine utterance unit boundaries, Crass-J first stipulates what an utterance unit actually is. This stipulation is based on an investigation of dialogue transcripts, and in the current version of Grass- .], the following syntactic constituents are recognized as utterance units.","• verb phrases (including auxiliary verb phrases","and adjective phrases) that may be followed by","=The roles of 'hal', ~tn interjectory response corresponding to ~ back-channel utterance sueh &s uh-huh in English but which occurs more frequently in Japanese di;> logue, axe discussed in Shimazu et at.

These. expressions may be analyzed morphologica.lly (Takeshita & Fukn naga, 1991). Because some expressions peculiar to spontaneous sl)eecb do not affect the propositiomd 1017 content of the sentences, disregarding those expressions might be a way to process spontaneons speech. Such cascaded processing of morphological analysis and syntactic and semantic analysis disables the incremental processing required for real-time dialogue understanding. Another approach is to treat these kinds of expressions as extra, 'noisy' words. Although this can be done by using a robust parsing technique, such as the one developed by Mellish (1989), it requires the sentence to be processed more than two times, and is therefore not suitable for real-time dialogue understanding. In Grass-J these expressions are handled in the same way as expressions appearing in written language, so no special techniqm~.s are needed. Words phonologically different froin corresponding words in written-language","The words 'tern' and 'ndesu' in 'shit tern ndesu ka' (do you know that'?) correspond semantically to 'teirn' and 'nodesu' in written sentences. We investigated such words in the dialogue data (Fig. 5). One way to handle these words is to translate them into their corresponding written-language words, but because this requires several steps it is not suitable for incremental dialogue processing. We therefore regard these words as independent of their corresponding words in written-language, even though their lexical entries have the same content. Fillers","Fillers such as 'anoo' and 'etto', which roughly correspond to wellin English, appear fl'equently in spore taneous speech (Arita et al., 1993) and do not affect the propositional content of sentences in which they appear 4 . One way to handle them is to disregard them after morphological analysis is completed. As noted above, however, such an approach is not suitable for dialogue processing. We therefore treat them directly in parsing.","In Grass-J, fillers modify the following words, whatever their grammatical categories are. The feature structure for fillers is as follows. head [pos interjection] su beat { } adjunct [ lexical +] adjacent nil lexical 4-sem [ restric {}] The value of the feature lexicaI is either + or -: it is + in lexical items and - in feature structures for phrases colnposed, by phrase structure rules, of sub-phrases. Because these words do not affect propositional contents, the value of the feature (sere restric) is empty.","For exalnple, let us look at the parse tree for 'etto 400-yen desu' (well, it's 400 yen).
