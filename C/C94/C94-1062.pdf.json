The design principles, though, are applicable to a large class of unification-based grammars where the constraints are realized as Prolog terms and applied monotonically through instantiation, where there is no right movement, and where left movement is handled by gap threading.","The I,R. parser was constructed for experiments on probabilistic parsing and speedup learning, see [10]. LI{ parsers are suitable for probabilistic parsing since they contain a representation of the current parsing state, namely the stack and the input string, and since the actions of the parsing tables are easily attributed probabilities conditional on this parsing state. LR parsers are suitable for the speedup learning application since tile learne~ grantmar Ls much larger than the original grammar, and the prefixes of tile learned rules overlap to a very high degree, circumstances that are far\" from ideal for the system's original parser. Even though these ends influenced the design of the parser, this article does not focus on these applications but rather on the design and testing of the parser itself."]},{"title":"2 LR PARSING","paragraphs":["An LI{ parser is a type of shift-reduce parser originally devised by Knuth for programming languages [4].

In her paper [5], Nakazawa proposes a simple and elegant solution to this problem: \"While the C LOS U ILE proced u re makes top-down predictions in the same way its beh)re [using the full constraints of the unitication grammar], new items ;tre added without instantlation.

The LIIS of these grammar rifles have no realization in the inlmt string since their RIIS are empty. They are used to model movement as in the sentence Whali does John seek ei .,2, which is viewed as a transfornration of John seeks what?. This is an example of left movement, since the word \"what\" has been moved to the left. Examples of right movement are rare in English, but frequent in other languages, the prime exarnple be-ing German subordinate clauses.","The particular unification grammar used keeps track of moved phrases by employing gap threading, i.e. by passing around a list of moved phrases to ensure that an empty production is only applicable if there is a moved phrase elsewhere in the sentence to license its use, see [6] pp. 125--129. As LR parsing is a parslug strategy employing bottom-up rule prediction, it is necessary to limit the applicability of these empty productions by the use of top-down filtering."]},{"title":"4 PARSER DESIGN","paragraphs":["The parser was implemented and tested in SICStus Prolog using a version of the SRI Core Language Engine (CLE) [2] adapted to the air4ravel information-service (NFIS) domain for a spoken-language translation task [8]. The CLE ordinarily employs a shift-reduce parser where each rule is tried in turn, although filtering using precompiled parsing tables makes it acceptably fast. The ATIS domain is a common ARPA testbench, attd the CLE performance on it is comparable to that of other systems.","In fact, two slightly ditferent versions of tile parser were constructed, one for the original grammar, employing a mechanism for gap handling, as described in Section 4.2, and one for the learned grammar, where no such mechanism is needed, since this grammar lacks empty productions, l~xperirnents were carried out ow~r corpora of 100-200 test sentences, using SLI{ parsing tables, to measure the impact on parser performance of the various modifications described below.","A depth-first, backtracking LI/. parser was used were the parsing is split into three phases:","1. Phase one is the LI{ parsing phase. The grammar used here is the generalized unification grammar described in Section 4.1 below. The output is a parse tree indicating how tile rules were applied to the input word string and what constraints were associated with eaelt word.","2. Phase two applies the full constraints of the syntactic rules of the unification grammar and lexicon to the output parse tree of phase one.","3. Phase three applies the constraints of the compositional semantic rules of the grammar. For tile learned grarmnar, phase two and three coincide, since tile learned rules include coml)ositional semantic constraints. Each rule referred to in the output parse tree of phase one may be a generalization over several ditDrent rules of tit(; unification grammar. Likewise, the constraints associated with each word can be a generalization over several distinct lexicon entries. In phase two, these difli~rent ways of applying the full constraints of the syntactic rules and the lexicon, and with the learned grammar also tile compositional semantic constraints, are attempted non-deterministically.","The lookahead symbols, on the other hand, are ground Prolog terms. Firstly, this means that they can be computed e[llciently in the LAI,I{. case. Secondly, this avoids trivial reduction ambignities where a particular reduction is performed once for each possible ruapping of the next word to a lookahead symbol. This is done by producing the set of all possible lookahead symbols ['or the next word at once, rather than producing one at a time non-deterministieally. Each reduction is associated with another set of lookahead symbols. The intersection is taken, and the result is passed on to the next parsing cycle.","Prefix merging means theft rules starting with similar phrases are processed together until they branch away. q'he problem with this in conjunction with a unification gramrnar is that it is not clear what \"similar phrase\" means. The choice made here is to regard phrases that rnap to tile same CF symbol as similar: Definition: Two phrases are similar if they map to the same conic*t-free symbol. Since the processing is performed by applying colt-straints incrementally and monotonically, where constraints are realized as Prolog terms and these are ill-stantiated stepwise, it is important that a UG phrase map to tile same CF symbol regardless of its degree of instantiation l'or this delinition to be useful. The mapping of tic phrases to CF symbols used in the experiments was the naive one, where UG phrases mapl)ed to their syntactic categories, (i.e. Prolog terms mapped to their ['unctors), save that vert)s with different complements (intransitive, transitive, etc.) were distinguished. 4.1 G,meralization The grammar used in phase one is not a eontexl.-fl'ee backbone grammar, nor the original unification grammar. Instead a generalized unification grammar is employed. This generalization is accomplish using anti-unification. Tiffs is the dual of uniIication it constructs tim least general term that subsumes two giwm terms --- and was first described in [7]. This operation is often refe.rred to as generalization in the computationallinguistics literature. If 7' is the anti-unification of Tt and 7), then 7' subsumes Tl and 5\" subsumes 5\".,, and if any other terrn 7\" subsumes both of 7'1 and 5/~, then T' snbsunqes 7'. Anti-uniflcation is a built-in predicate of SICStus Prolog and quite acceptably fast.","For each context-free rule, a generalized UG rule is constructed that is the generalization over all UG rules 388 that lnltp to that context-free rule. If there is only one such orightal UG rule, the full constraints of the nnification grammar are applied already ill phase one.","Siwilarly, the symbols of the action and gore tables are not context-free symbols. Tliey are the general-izations of all relevant similar UG phrases. For exampie, each entry in the goto table will have as a symbol the generalization of a set of UG phrases. These UG phrases are those that map to the same context-free symbol; occur in a UG rule that corresponds to an item where this CF symlml immedhttely follows the clot; and ill such a UC, rule occur at tile position immediately following tile clot. For example, tile synibol of the gore (or shift) entry for verbs between State 1 and State 6 of Fig. 2 is the anti-unification of tim RIIS verbs of tile UG rules inapping to lhlles 2, 3 and 4, e.g. vp: [agr=Agr] => [v : [agr=Agr,sub=intran] ]. vp : [agr=Agr] => [v : [agr=/lgr, sub=Áran[ ,np : [agr= ] ]. vp: [agr=Jtgr] =>","[v : [agr=Agr, sub=ditran], np : last= ] , np : [agr= ] ]. which is v: [agr=_,sub= ]. llere the vahle of the subcategorization feature sub is left unspecilied.","l,exical arnbignity iii the input sentence is handled in the same wliy. For each word, a generalized phrase is constructed from all similar phrases it can lie analyzed as. Again, if there is no lexical ambiguity within the CF symbol, the fllll UO constraints are apl)lied. Nothing is done about lexical an-lbignities outside of the sltnie CF symbol, though.","In the experiments, using the UG constraints, in-stead of their generalizations, for tile LR-parsing phase led to an increase in median normalized parsing tinie l from a.1 to"]},{"title":"3.8,","paragraphs":["i.e. by 20 %.

This and prefix merging are vital when working with the learned grammar since many rules overlap totally or partially on the context-free level.","Interleaving context-free processing with applying the fidl constraints of the unitlcation grammar to prune the search space restores some of the predictive power lost using a context-free backbone grammar.
