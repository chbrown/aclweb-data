I. INTII.ODUCTION In this paper, we give a formed representation of the thematie-rhematic ('P-ll) structure of a, nahum] lsLntriage discourse. Some pairs, triples, or in general n-tuples of sentences in a discourse may differ in the 1)hLee of theh' information focus. The distribution of this inform~ttion focus is c~dled the thematic-thematic (T-R) structure, or dichotomy. [n English, the use of paa'ticles tile and a (an) is deeply related to tile T-ll strnctu re. lit general, a noun with the particle a constitutes arheme part of tit(; sentence that appears at the ])cginiug of the discourse or text, while that noun with the p~Lrticle tl~e ~ppe~rs ht the second, third, etc. sentences ~LS themes. In Ja.p~Lnese, the %1{ dichotomy is we.ll represented by postpositlons wa and .qa. The Korean bLnguage h~s a similar system. Meanwhile, in Slavic langu~rges ~s Polish, Czech, and ]lnssian, the word order is free ~nd this degree of freedom is used h)r the represent~tion o[ the T-R dichotomy. In Chinese, the word order is also used f(~r the T-R di~ chotomy. Besides theme and rheme, simibLr terms s.s old-information and new-itgormation, topic ~nd comment, topic ~tnd focus etc. ~re used in the literature concerning functionaL1 lingnistics (see, e.g., Va]lduvi). In our ~tn~dysis, since we do not define these terms explicily, it is not essenti~d which terms are used. We. give implicit definition of these concepts a.z'iomatically. We eonside.r the problem mainly for J~p~Lnese. We propose to Its('. typed A-c~deulus to analyse the problent. A logie~d notation is seen as a typed X term. Batsi(: types sLre T and l{. t{.onghly speaking, 7' and ll stand for a thenw, l)~rt ~Lnd a rhemc part of e~ sentence, respectively. Tile difference of T-It dichotomy is given by different types. Thus tile same sentence *nay h;~ve different types depending on the *l';tchujim~ Kotc-ku Tokyo J~tpa, n sitnation. For utterstnces, type inference will be performed. The corre<:tness of ~t given discourse can bc proved by eheckh~g the correctness of the types of each utters, ace. ]in tills p~q)er, we elaborate on this ideaL. II. REPRESENTATION BASED ON A TYPED A-CALCULUS 'I'll(; purpose of this psLper is to propose ~t formaJ model for nttersu~ce interprctsLtion of the them~ttic rhematic structure of a ,|~tp~tnesc scntel/ee using tt typed k-cedculus. In our sLn~dysls, a logical notsttion is seen as a typed A-term. B~tsic types stre. 51' a, nd /L Roughly spe~king, 7' and /{ sttuld R)r ~ theme ps~rt and ~ rheme part of a sentence, respeetlvely. Although we analyse ma.hdy Japanese sentences, the resnlts can be tLpp]ied to other langn,Lges. The T-[~ dichotomy of ~t Japanese sentence is represented by the postpositions wa a.nd ga. For extLmple, the folo lowing two sentences ~re different in T-I{ dichotomy, ~nd used in dit[rent situtttions: (a) Taroo wa Gakusei ,lea,,. (Speaking of Ta,'oo, he is a student) (b) 'l'aroo ga (?akusei desu. ((Of all the people we are talkino abo,a) \"*~,'oo (and o,~l,a 7a,'oo) i.~ ~, .,t,,,~e,~t.) The mo~ning or both (,,) a~,(l 0') i,~ ~'~,,.0o i., a .~,,t~,,~, ~nd thus ma.y be wrlten ~s student(Tn.roo). I[ow~ ever this representation is obviously not sufficient for an ~tcc'ount of the utter~Lnce interpretation of (~) and (b). The NI' (noun phrase) of (a) marked with wa functions as ~ theme, i.e., it should h~Lve ~dready ,~ppetered in the preceding discourse and thns can be considered ~m ~n old information. Therefore, in the discourse, sentence (~) should t)e preceded by ~t sentenee that contains \"l'a~'oo sm a rhe.me (new information), l,'or example, Taroo in the. fol]owing sentence can be considered as ~L new information: (c) 7a,'0o ga ima.su. (llc,'e is 7h,'oo.) The pair (e), (a)in this order is ~L correct discourse utterance. On the other h,~nd, the p~dr (c), (b)cannot be considered correct since student functions ,as ~ theme in (b) while it h~m not appeared in the preceding context. As is seen 1105 from (b) and (c), an NP marked with postposltion .qa fnnctions as a theme (i.e., information focus). To explain the difference between (a) and"]},{"title":"(b)","paragraphs":["in the utterance level, we annotate Ax.student(x) of (a) and (b) by different typed A-terms. Roughly speaking we assign T ---* It and R to each Ax.studeM(x) of (a) and (b), respectively. Based on this, if we can show student(Taroo): 12 then we say sentence (a) (or (b)) of the discourse is correct. For example, if Taroo of (@ has a type T then by the fl-reduction of typed A-calculus, we have student(Taroo) : 12. For Taroo to have a type T, we impose a constraint that Taroo must have appeared in a preceeding sentence. Other cases can be treated similarly. See the following descriptions for details. Thus the correctness of the discourse CaLL be proved by checking the correctness of the types of eavh formula.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have given a formM representation of the T-R structure of a natural language discourse. We have proposed using a notion of typed /k-cMculus. A logical notation has been seen as a typed ),-term. The correctness of a given discourse can be proved by checking the correctness of the types of each utterante. Although we have analysed mainly Japanese sentences, the results can be applied to other lnnguages by considering adaquate translation rules to encode a given sentence to formal representations. in Uetake (1993, 1994), the author has proposed an-other tool for the analysis of the T-R structure. The tool nsed there is a logical notation called ontological promiscuity of Ilobbs (1985), which is first-order and nonintensionM. Using this description, a proof process of utterance interpretation of a discourse is obtained. It is interesting that two concepts similar to these (i.e., typed A-c~dculus and ontological promiscuity) used in the analysis of the T-R structure of a discourse are used in the theory of constructive mathematics (r-realizability and constructive type theory). The concept of ontological promiscuity in Uetake(1993, 1994) corresponds to the rreMizability and the typed ),-c~lculns of this paper to the constructive type theory. See Uetake (1994) for more detailed discussion. One of the reviewers noted that Barbara Partee is recently working on logically reconstructing the Prague school's notion of topic-focus articulation.
