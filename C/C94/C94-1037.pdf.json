In Fig.5, -37 is Ihe linmal core. A core with its category (x in the example at h:md) is called a nucleus. The graph it/ Fig.5 can be seen as a nelwork of nodes.

The nelwork output will then be the calcgory associated with the actiwltcd core. 235 236 3 <=> X 4 <=> 0 Fig. 6 riwfl cores in a multicategory network","More concretely, if a certain lbrm, say 437, ix given as input to the network, the system tries to guess the right category on the basis of the analogy of 437 (called the target string) with already stored items (called base strings). This is carried out through the lbllowing steps. Network cores are activalcd by 437: this is done through a simple string-matching routine 2. For example, 37 will be actiwtted, and its category x ix a candidate response of the system for the input 437. What happens when more than one core gets activated by the same input token? If the activated cores have the same category, the corresponding mtdtiple responses would reinforce each other: the only category activated is given as OUtl~Ut. The case of multiple responses with different categories (and thus potentially different outputs) is more complex. We can dislinguish two cases: I) there is no core which is fully activated 2) there ix at least one fully activated core.","A core is fully activated when it is entirely contained by the input string: in the example above 437 fully actiwttes the core -37. This contrasts with partial activation, when the core is only partially contained by the input string: for example, 437 partMly activates the core -38 of Fig.6 above, since it contains 3 in the second position, but not 8 in the third. Let ns consider case 1) above first, l[' there is no core which is fully activated, then the system goes through the following two steps: la) for each candidate response, the system gauges an Activation Ratio:","number of numerals (+1 the activated core contained in input","total number of numerals in the actNated core","The actiwttion ratio (AcR) is then 0 < AcR _< I. The case of full actiwttion (AcR= 1) is dealt with in 2); lb) the core with the highest AcR wins out over the others.","Let us consider now case 2). If there exists at least one fully activated core, then two I'urfl~er subcases need be distinguished: 2a) there is only one core which is fully activated: the category borne out by that core is 2 More on string-matching will be said in section 4 of this papcr. then picked up; 2b) there are at least two cores which are fully activated. 2a) can be seen as a degenerate case of 1) above, when AcR = I. As to 2b), in this case the activation ratio is clearly no longer conclusive. One needs to gauge :t further ratio, called Analogy Ratio, whose definition follows:","total number of numerals in the activated core","total number of numerals in input &gain, the analogy ratio (AnR) is 0 < AnR _< 13. To stnn up, a certain pattern is analogic,'dly activated","if the following conditions are met in tiffs order: I) it is activated by an input pair 2) it has got the highest activation ratio 3) it has got the highest analogy ratio","So far, we have been assenting that the network produces cores incrementally as more data .'n'o input. In fact, the nclwork pfogressively exlracts retlnced cores. Each full form is aheady a core in its own right, otherwise it would never get activated. The exmtction of smaller cores represents the process of acquiring generalizations on the basis of the analogy between data (redundancies). In the network, an exception is simply an isolated case, that is a nucleus which is fully actiwtted only when it is witnessed in input in its enlircty (AnR = I).","3 AN ANAI~OGY-BASH) NETWORK FOIl.

These performances have been obtained hy using tile simplified model illusm~ted here.","It should he noted, however, that this model works well for the Morphology of Ihose hmguages (such as Italian and English) where affixation is commonly realized through a concatenative operation (surfixation or prel'ixation). In these cases, string-matching is a fairly simple head-and-tail operation. Clearly, this model is far from having a universal, cross-linguistic wdidity though. For example, it does not work well with cases of circumfixation (known also as parasynthesis), let alone tile Morphology of nonconcatenative l'mguages. Nevertheless, we contend that the set of analogy-based principles illustrated here hold Ibr a wider spectrum or hmguages than purely concatenative ones: by making string-nmtehing a more flexible and powerful operation, we can successfully adapt our model to the requirenaents of noncatenative languages such as Arabic, or Io the treatment of discontinuous affixation.
