One a,ppro~ch to the problem of capturing meanings ~tt the lcxi<:al level is to use a form of distributed representation where each word meaning is converted into a point in an n-dimenskmal space (Sutcliffc, 1992a). Such rel)- resentations can capture a wide variety of word meanings within the same forlnalism. In addition they can be used within distributed representations [br capturing higher level information such as that expressed I)y sentences (Sutcliffc, 1991a). Moreover, they can be scaled to suit a particular tradeoil\" of speciticity and memory usage (Sutclilfi~, 1991b). Hnally, distributed representations can be processed conwmiently by vector processing methods or connectionist algorithms and can be used either as part of a symbolic system (Sutclitl~, 1992b) or within a eonnectionist architecture (Sutcliffe, 1988). In previous work we have shown how such representations can be constructed automatically by the method of taxonomic tr~Lversal, using tire Merriam Webster Compact Electronic die-- tionary (Sutcliffe, 1993) ~md the Irish-Irish An Focldir Beag (Sutcliffe, McElligott and O Ndill, 1993). Ilow ever our efforts so far have I)een limited by our parsing technology to lexicons of a few thousand words. We describe here how we can gel|er;M,e a lexical entry for any of the 71,000 nouns 2 in the Princeton WordNet (Beckwith, Fetlbaum, (]ross mM Miller, 1992), and the initial tests we have conducted on the representations.","Our method is closely related to other work which exploits the taxonomic nature of dictionary detinitions (Amsler, 1980; Iliedorn, Byrd and (~hodorow, t986; Vossen, 1990; Guthrie, Slator, Wilks and I/ruce, 1990; Nutter, Fox and Evens, 1990). In addition there. have already been some very interesting al)l)roaehes to the construction of distributed semantic representations either from dicl, ionaries (Wilks el, el., t990) or fl'om corpora (Schuetze, 1993).","1 This research was support~ed in l)art by the I!]m'Ol)Can Union under (:ontract~ 1,1{E-6203(1 and by the National Software ])irectoratc of h'chmd. Wc are indebted to Tony Molloy, HedmolM O'Brien and Gcmn~a ltyan i~:n' t.heir help with this work.","2'l'his figure includes hyphenat~cd t.erms, COml)ound nouns ~klld Ill'Opel\" l[&tl[ll~s, 2 EXTRACTING FEATURE R,EPR,ESEN-TATIONS 'l'he object of our work is to produce for each n()un sense in a lexicon a semantic reprcscntation consist. ing of a set of tim.lure-centrality p~firs. The lhatures are semantic attributes each of which says something about the concept being defined. 'Phe centrality as-sociated with each feature is ;u real mmd)er which in-- dicatcs how strongly the feature contributes to the meaning of the concept. The use of centralities allows us to distinguish I)etwecn important and less impor taut ti;atures in a semantic rel)resentation. By scaling the centralities in a particular noun-sense representation so that tire stun of their squares is one we can use the (lot product ol)eration to compute the sen,an tic simila.rity of a pair of coneel)ts. A word COlnpared to itself always scores OlLe while a word compared to another word is always less than or equal to one. This is equivalent to saying that each word representation is a vector of length one in an n-dimensional space, where n is the nmnber of features which are used in the lexicon as a whole.","Our algorithm for constructing the representations is based on two well-known observations. Firstly, a word definition in a dictionary provides attribute in-I'ormation about the COlmept ('a ilia.still' is a LAR(31'; dog'). Secondly a word delinition also provides tax(> nomic information about the concept ('a mastiff is i~ large DOG'). We use the former to derive attributes for our representation, and the latter to ol)tain other definitions higher up in the taxonomy from which fur-- ther attril)utes can be obtained. In assigning central ities to %aturcs, we use the same value for each attribute added at a particuli~r level in the taxonomic hierarchy, and we reduce the value used as we move u 1) to higher levels. This corresponds I,o the intuition that a feature which is derived from a delinitioa which is close to the word of interest in the taxonomy con tri/)utes more to its meaning than one which is derived from a more distanu detinition.","The Princeton WordNet is very suitable lbr use in iml)lementing our extraction algorithm because taxo nomic links are represented explicitly by pointers. In most Ml{l)s such links have to be deduced by synta(> tic and semantic analysis of sense detinitions. Nouns in WoMNet are organised around"]},{"title":"synsels.","paragraphs":["I!;ach synset may inelmle a list of synonyms, pointers to hyponym and hypernym synsets, and a gloss con'esponding to a conventional dictionary definition. 827 Figure 1.

'l?he gloss is tokenised, function words are removed and tire relnaining content words are converted to their root railer(ion. All such words are considered to be real,ares of the word-sense, and are given a centrality of 1.0. We then chain at)war(Is using a hypernymic link (if any) 3. At the. next level up, features are extracted from the hypernym's gloss, nsing a centrality of 0.9. The process is repeated, reducing the centrality by 0.1 at each level, until either the top of tire hierarchy is reached or the centrality falls to zero. Finally, the rel)resentat.ion , consisting of a set of feature-centrality l)airs, is normalised. 3 RESULTS The Mgorithm deseril)ed above has helm imt)hmmnted and can be used to construct a lexical entry for any of the nouns in the WordNet database. Figure 1 shows the synset hypernym hierarchy for tile word 'terrier' in WordNet. Figure 2 shows the semantic representation derived by the algorithm for this word. We present here some preliminary exl)eriments whic.h attempt to measure the performance of the lexicon. Four words were chosen fi'om each of live categories of noun wlfi('.h we label cars, clogs, /lowers, trees mid peol)le. These are shown in Table I. Talrle 2 shows a Slllllll/lary of tile characteristics of the word representations in the set of twenty words. Pairs of categories were ehosoil, cars-dogs, flowers-trees alld so ()[1~ each contain-ing eight words. A series of eighl.-by-eight tables was then computed, showing the dot l)roduct of each word with every other word in the category pair. Table 3 shows the results for the curs-dogs matrix. There are several points to note about this table. I:'irstly, the match of one car word with another is high, ranging between 0.58 and 1.0 with an average of 0.8. This shows that the lexicon has cal)tured the similarity between the ear coneel)ts. Secon(lly, the match of one dog word with another is also high, ranging I)etwcen 0.63 and 1.0 with an average of 0.76, for the same festoon. Thirdly, the lnateh of a car word with a clog word is low, ranging between 0.05 and 0.17 with an average of 0.t. This is heeause cars and dogs are not closely linke.d semantically. Tal)le 4 shows resuits for the flowers-trees matrix. Flowers and trees are much more closely related semantically thau cars and dogs, and this is rellected in the results. Hower words match with tree words in a range of 0.30 to 0.67","aAt. wesent, we only clmosc the firs(, such link if there are several. with an average of 0.4, n~mch higher than for cars m~d dogs. The match of flowers with tlowers or trees with trees continues to be high. Finally, Tabh; 5 shows the people-dogs matrix. Note here thai; the match of people with themselwes is lower than that of (logs with themselves (average 0.63 rather than average 0.76.) This is because tile people words are in fact a rather disparate set. Note in particular that 'bruiser' against 'rake' is the best lnatch while 'bruiser' against 'patriarch' is the worst. This matches one's intuitions abont these concepts: patriarchs are \"good\" while 'hruisers' all(l q'akes' arc not. 4 CONCLUSIONS We have presented a simph', algorithm which allows a set of distributed lexical semantir representations to be constructed from nouns in the Princeton WordNet. '['he results show that the method works and produces good results. The main reason for this is the explicit taxonomic information in WordNet which has to be inferred in other dictionaries. Incorrect taxonomic information seriously degrades the pex[brrnanee of this Idml of method. On the other hand errors in individual features arc not so harmful as they have. no knock on effects. Ilowever, we are engaged in eliminating errors in word sense and syntactic category which are the princilml sources of inaccuracy in the method. In addi|;ion we a.re working on objective methods for nw.asl,ring the perfornmnce of the lexicon on a large scale. 5 FLEFERF, NCES Amsler, R.A. (1984). Machine-l{,e;~dable I)ictionaries.
