ANAPHORA AND ELLIPSIS RESOLUTION","paragraphs":["Jos6 Abraqos, Jos6 Gabriel Lopes - (jea,gpl) @fct.unl.pt CRIA/UNINOVA, Faculdade de Ci6ncias e Tccnologia, 2825 Monte da Capafica, Portugal ABSTRACT","Cormack (1992) proposed a framework for pronominal anaphora resolution. Her proposal integrates focusing theory (Sidner et al.) and DRT (Kamp and Reyle). We analyzed this methodology and adjusted it to the processing of Portuguese texts. The scope of the framework was widened to cover sentences containing restrictive relative clauses and subject ellipsis. Tests were conceived and applied to probe the adequacy of proposed modifications when dealing with processing of current texts. 1. INTRODUCTION","Pronominal anaphora resolution, as part o1' a more general process of anaphora resolution, is a determinant step in constructing a semantic representation of a text. Although \"general cognitive processes DO play a role in establishing anaphoric dependencies (...)\" (Kempson, 1990 p.14), inference is, in computational terms, a very expensive process, both for the amount of processing involved and for the extension of the knowledge bases required. Therefore, any system aiming at efficiency in anaphora resolution should minimize the role of inference.","As far as DRT is concerned, the construction rule for pronouns slates that the referent introduced by the pronoun should be bound to a"]},{"title":"suitable","paragraphs":["referent, chosen among those that are accessible (Kamp and Reyle, 1993 p.122). The"]},{"title":"accessibility","paragraphs":["is based on semantic constraints and is expressed by the structure of DRS representing the text. However the"]},{"title":"suitability","paragraphs":["of referents is ill-defined.","Another perspective for anaphora resolution is founded on the principle of relevance, i.e. on \"the presumption that every utterance is selected to convey the intended interpretation while imposing to the hearer the least amount of processing effort in constructing that interpretation\" (Kempson 1990 p.17). Focusing/ centering theories (Grosz; Sidner; Brenn,'m, Friedman and Pollard et al.) can be considered as having this perspective. They try to keep track of the focus of attention along the text and bind pronouns preferentially to focused entities. The choice of antecedents is based on pragmatic constraints, which put an ordering on preferences between ,antecedent czmdidates.","Cormack proposes the integration of focusing and DRT, \"(...) adding semantic constraints to a model of attention in discourse\" (Cormack, 1992 p.5). This integration compensates for two shortcomings of DRT: it considers too many possibilities for anaphoric binding and doesn't provide an ordering between antecedent candidates. From the focusing point of view, the addition of semantic constraints, provided by DRT, to the pragmatic ordering further restricts the determination of possible antecedents.","We analyzed Cormack's proposal, and found out that it was lacking some features that we consider more adequate, as it will be shown in the next few sections. Therefore we adapted it, and applied the modified version to the processing of texts written in Portuguese. The scope of d~osc mcthods was widened to cover sentences containing restrictive relative clauses and subject ellipsis. Tests were conceived and applied to probe the adequacy of proposed modifications when dealing with processing of current texts. 2. SIMPLE SENTENCES 2.1. Alterations to DRT","Cor,nack defends that pronouns of the current sentence can only have access to two groups of referents: focused referents and those unfocused ones that were introduced by the preceding sentence. Referents not fitting any of these two groups can be forgotten. Let us look at an example (Connack, 1992 p.350): (la) John took apart the chest 0 f drawers. (lb) it was full of clothes pegs. The DRS representing the first sentence will be (foct, sed referents are shown on the left, unfocused ones on the right): 5> I< .j c > John0) chest of drawers(c) Iook_apan(j,c) The second sentence introduces another DRS. Anaphors are resolved with referents of previous DRS,"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["<>l<jc> <c>I<P> John(j) 'clothes_pegs(P) chest of drawers(c) [ full of(c,P) took_apart(i,c) , and then previous DRS can be \"R~rgotten\":"]},{"title":"1128 i ,","paragraphs":["<c>l<P> clothes_pegs(P) t'nll of(c,P) Referent John, who was introduced by (la), was only available for anaphor resolution in (lb). Since it was never focused, it is \"forgotten\". This means that it is no longer included in the referents of the DRS representing the text after processing of the second sentence, becoming unavailable as antecedent candidate for pronouns in following sentences. This claim may seem a little strange if we look at (lc) as an acceptable third scntenee: (lc) lie didn't like dmir color.","Two other aspects of Cormack's representation led us to prefer to keep to the original DRT formalism. First, Cormack's representation is too conditioned by pronominal anaphora resolution. Referents that become unavailable for pronominal reference, and are therefore \"forgotten\", may still be cospecified hy definite descriptions. Eliminating them from tbe representation would be a limit to the possibilities of expanding the system in the fltture. Second, \"forgetting\" conditions introduced by previous sentences leads to a situation where the DRS representing Ihe text at a given moment will contain little information about the text, and no information at all about some of the \"surviving\" referents• For instance, looking at the last DRS presented, we no longer know what entity introduced referent cl. 2.2. Focusing algorithms","Most focusing theories keel) referents that can be relevant in future anaphora resolution in focus stores. Sidner considers two groups of focus stores, which in a very short and simplistic way can be described as: those related to agent tAG) role: actor locus (AF) - AG of current sentence or previous","AF, if current sentence has no AG; potential actor focus list (PAFL) - other animate","referents of current sentence; actor focus stack (AFS) - previous AFs; those related to other thematic roles: discourse focus (DF) - • DF of previous sentence, if referred with a pronoun in current mntence; • referent of the highest ranking pronoun 2 in current mntence; • theme, in discourse initial sentences; 1 We can, of course, overcome this limitation by creating a text knowledge base where all the restrictions upon referents are present. 2 sue (Sidner. 1979), (Cormack, 1992) for details about this ranking potential discourse locus list (PDFL) - referents of","current sentence excluding DF; discourse focus stack (DFS) - previous DFs.","In determining the antecedent of a pronoun, algorithms go through some preliminary considerations (such as recency rule) and a basic ordering of focus stores. AF - DF distinction","Although taking Sidner's algorithms as a starting point, Cormack renounces the distinction between actor focus and discourse focus, in the final part of her work. The algorithms become more simple but they loose in discriminatory power. This is particularly more significant in a language like Portuguese, where nominals can only be masculine or feminine (not neuter)• In a text like","(2a) O Jofio escreveu um livro.","John wrote a book. (AF = John, DF = a book)","(2b) A Maria lets-().","Mary read it. eliminating the distinction between AF and DF would lead to Jodo (lohn) being proposed as preferred antecedent of the masculine pronoun o (it). Rejecting this binding would require an appeal to inference, wlfich is something that we want to minimize. Keeping AF - DF distinction will also be significant in dealing with another phenomenon very common in Portuguese: subject (SU) ellipsis. Recency rule \"if the pronoun under consideration occurs in the subjcct position, and there is an alternate focus list noun phrase which occurs as the last constituent in the previous sentence, test that alternate focus list phrase for co-st)ecification before testing the current focus. (...)\" (Sidner, 1979 p.144).","Sidner admits that \"the recency rule makes focussing seem somewhat ad hoc\" (ibid.), Carter states that \"its inclusion in SPAR led to considerable inaccuracy\" (Cartes\" 1987 p.114) and Cormack decides to ignore it too (Cormack, 1992 p.54), ttowever, it seems that, in Portuguese, this rule should be considered for pronouns in AG position:","(3a) A Maria i deu um livm a Anaj. Mary i gave Annj a book. If tile agent of the ncxt sentence is Mary there are two ix)ssit)ilities of pronominalization: the prontmn ela (she) or the null pronoun (~ (SU ellipsis). This last option will be l)mferrexl:","(3b) ~i comprara-o num leilfio. ¢i had bought it at an auction• 1129 But if the agent of the next sentence is Ann, the only possibility of pronominalization will be the cxplicit pronoun ela (she):","(3b') Elaj Icu-o. Shej read it. So thc speaker will tend to use a null pronoun in AG position to eospccify the agcnt of the previous sentcncc, reserving the explicit pronoun a use that conforms with thc recency rule. Intrasentential anaphora","Carter inserts intrasentential candidates (ISC) between current feel and potential loci, in the basic ordering. Cormack distinguishes between focused ISC and remainder oflSC. In our implementation this distinction seemed unnecessary and we decided to insert ISC alter potential foci, in thc basic ordering. A special casc of ISC is the reflexivc pmn(mn se (himself/herse!f/itself/ themselves). We always bind it to the agent of the scntcnce.","(4) O camelo i dcitou-se i na arcia. The camel i laid (itse!f i) down on the sand. Intrasentential catapbora","In our implementation, syntatic parsing is done according to grammar (levclopment formalisms hased on barricrs, movcment and binding (Lopcs 1991). It is an cxtension of thc extraposition grammar formalism (Pereira 1981) and allows for movement of constituents of a scntencc in a rcstrictcd area delimited by harricrs. The resulting synUltic trcc will always show the intcrnal arguments of the verb on it's right, no matter what positions they had in the original sentence. For instance, the syntatic trec for (5) Near her, the blond girl saw a man. will be: S NP VP NP PP lhe blond girl saw a man near her","The anaphora resolution process works on the restdts of the syntatic parser, so this kind of cataphora will be trc~lted as intrasentential anaphora. Subject ellipsis","As mentioned above, this is a very common phcnomcnon in Portugncse language. Null pronoml in AG position seems to behave differently from onc in non-AG position. In thc first case it cospecifies AF or a combination of foci including AF: (6a) A Maria i dccidiu ofcrcccr aquele perfume h Arm. Mary i decided to offer Ann that perfume. AF = Mary (6b) ~i gostava muito dole. (b i liked it very much. A null pronoun in non-AO position cospccifics DF or a combination of foci including DF: (7a) O Joao poisou o livro i sobrc o piano. John put the book i on the piano. DF = the book (7b) (Diem grandee pesado. ~i was big and heavy. Ratification procedure","Both Sidner and Cormack leave all verifications of syntactic agreement and consistency with world knowlextge to a ratification procedure, to be appliexl after completion of focusing process. Efficiency can be improved if inexpensive number and gcnder agreement and reflexivity verificatk)ns arc included in the focusing proccss. Thus, scvcral inadcqrmte candidates can be ruled out without a call to the ratification procedure.","3. SENTENCES CONTAINING RESTRICTIVE RELATIVE CLAUSES","Going beyond simple sentcnces, we widcncd thc scope of the prescntcd methods to includc sentcnccs with restrictive relative clauses (for short, we'll just use the form relative clauses in the remainder of this paper). Rules for focus movement and refcrcnts accessibility were formulated and tests werc dcsignetl to probe their adcqt, acy. In this secti(m we refer to the results of a qucstionnairc answered by 40 collcge students. Focus movement (8a) O Joao leu unl livro i.","John read a book i. DF = a book (8b) O homemj que o i cscreveu morreu.","The manj who wrote it i died. (8c) Os eruditos cnalteceram-no i v j ? muito.","Erudite people praised him~it i v j ? much. According to focusing rules, tile pronoun in (8c) cospecifies DF of (8b). ff lnXmouns in relative clauses were able to influence focus then (81)) would confirm a book as DF and this would be the antecedent of the pronoun in (8c). That doesn't sccm to be the case. The intuitively preferred antecedent is the man. Examples like this show that pronouns occurring within relative clauses dofft seem to inlluence focus movement. This colmlusion was confirmed by 83% of the answers to the alx)ve mentioned questionnaire. Access of following sentences to relative clause referents","Referents introduced 1)y the relative clause arc acccssiblc hut arc not preferred to main clause rcfcrcnts. The qucstionnairc prcscnted the text: 1130","(9) 0 homem a quem u,n ladr~o roubou o rcldgio chamou a polfcia. Ele ... The man whom a thief stole the watch from calh:d the police, lie ... 58% of the continuations proposed bind the pronoun to the main clause referent the man while only 28% indicate binding with file relative clause referent a thief. Access of the relative clause to main clause referents (10) O Joao deu um livro i at) ahmo qnc o i merecia.","John gave a book i to the student who deserved it i. Pronouns in the relative clause can cospecify both main clause referents or focus stores. The first situation seems to be preferred except, perhaps, for pronouns in AG position, that show a weak preference (suplx)rted by 61% of the answers) for cospecification with AF or a member of PAFL. Access of the main clause to relative clause referents (11) O homem que escreveu um livro i deu-o i a Maria.","The man who wrote a book i gave it i to Mary. Pronouns in the main clause, occunilLg after the relative clause, can cospecify it's rclerents, lake Cormack, we conskler access to focus storcs to be more likely, lint this preference was not confirmed by the results of the questionnaire (60% of the answers were against).","Access of relative clause to relative clause","(12) O homem qtte a Maria i viu escreven um livro title a i imprcssionou. The man who was seen by Mary i wrote a book that impressed her i. Pronouns in the second relative clause can cospccify referents of the first one. ttowever, it seems that main clause referents should be prelerrtxl as antecedents. The example used to test this preference was not very clear and so we've got 63% of negative answers.","Transitive access to a main clause","(13) A Maria i casou corn o cliente qlce conlprou 0 livro que ela i e~reven. Mary i married the client who bought the book that she i wrote. Pronouns in ,'1 nested relative clause cnt| cospccify main clause referents. Preference seems to be given to antcccxlent candidates of the main clause over those el: the nesting relative chmse, but this hypothesis was not testexl.","Transitive access to a relative clause","(14) O cliente que comprou () livro que a emprcgada i escrcveu casou corn ela i. The client who bought the book that was written by the employee i married her i. Pronouns in the main clause can cospccify nested relative clntnse referents. Candidate nnteccxlents occurring in the nesting relative clause seem to be preferred though. This preference is supported by 75% of the answers. Ordering autecedent candidates","We can summarize this analysis in the following rules lot predicting antecedents.

A farmer who (subjunctive of ~) a donkey beats it. This kind of sentences is associated to non-factual, hypothetical presuppositions and is semantically equivalent to an implication relation between two clauses:","(17') Seum agricultor tern um burro entfio bate-lhe. If a farmer owns a donkey then he beats it. So, our implementation represents this kind of sentences as conditionals: [xy donkey(y) owns(x,y) zw","=7> Z=X w=y beats(z,w) Our rules for anaphora resolution will then be applied as usual, taking in consideration both focusing and semantic (DRT-detennined) acessihility constraints. 4. TESTING","Tests were conceived with the only purpose of probing the adequacy of proposed modifications. One of the tests, the questionnaire, has already been inentioned. It consisted of two parts. In the first one there were short texts (2-4 sentences) where some referents were introduced. The last sentence was always incomplete and contained a pronoun. The continuation proposed by the student was supposed to show which co-specification he had chosen. Since the evaluation of this part might be influenced by intuition, it was committed to 3 independent evaluators, who were found to agree on 80% of the answers. The second part consisted of texts of the same kind, but where all sentences were co,nplete. The student was asked to identify explicitly the co-specification of a pronoun introduced by the last sentence. The results concerning relative clauses were presented in last section. Recency rule and rules for subject ellipsis were confirmed respectively by 77% and 85% of the answers.","The two other tests consisted of applying the rules for relative clauses to all anaphome found in current texts, and whose antecedent or anapho,\" were introduced by a relative clause. \"Fhe first target text was a novel by a famous Portuguese writer of lhe end of last century, Eqa de Queiroz (19(/0). The news of a Portuguese news agency (Lusa, 1993) provided 637 kbytes of fresh (June93) raw material for the last test. The rules performed correctly in respectively 96% and 92% of the cases. 5. CONCLUSION","We developed and implemented a mechanism ['or pronominal anaphora resolution, integrating focusing and DRT, and adjusted to Portuguese language processing. Modifications to other authors proposals included recovering AF - DF distinction and recency rule, handling intrasentential anaphora, cataphora, subject ellipsis, restrictive relative clauses and, in particular, Ihose containing subjunctives.","Focusing mechanisms enabled the reduction and ordering of the set of possible antecedents for each anaphor. Final ratification or rejection of each suggested co-specification would require the use of world knowledge and reasoning. That was beyond the aim of this work.","The analysis made for restrictive relative clauses should be extended to other constructions of subordination and coordination, in order to establish more general rules. We believe that many questions raised here might be relevant to processing of other romance languages.","REFERENCES","Brennan, S., M. Friedman and C. Pollard (1987). A centering approach to pronouns.
