The Text Encoding Initiative (TEl) is an international project established in 1988 to develop guidelines for the preparation and interchange of electronic texts for research, and to satisfy a broad range of uses by the language industries more generally. The need for standardized encoding practices has become inxreasingly critical as the need to use and, most importantly, reuse vast amounts of electronic text has dramatically increased for both research and industry, in particular for natural language processing.

Introduction","paragraphs":["The past few years have seen a burst of activity in the development of statistical methods which, applied to massive text data, have in turn enabled the dcvelopnmnt of increasingly comprehensive and robust models of language structure and use. Such models are increasingly recognized as an inwduable resource for natural langu:lge processing (NLP) tasks, inch,ding machine translation. The upsurge of interest in empricial methods for language modelling has led inevitably to a need for massive collections of texts of all kinds, including text collections which span genre, register, spoken and written data, etc., as well as domain- or application-specific collections, and, especially, multi-lingual collections with parallel translations. In tile latter half of the 1980's, very few appropriate or adequately large text collections existed for use in computational linguistics research, especially for languages other than English. Consequently, several efforts to collect and disseminate large mono- and multi-lingual text collections have been recently established, including the"]},{"title":"ACL Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI),","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"European Corpus Initiative (ECI),","paragraphs":["which has developed a multilingual, partially parallel corpus, the U.S."]},{"title":"Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), RELATOR","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"MULTEXT","paragraphs":["in EuropE, etc. (see Arm.strong-Warwick, 1993). It is widely recognized that such efforts constitute only a beginning for the necessary data collection and dissemination efforts, and that considerable work to develop adequately large and appropriately constituted textual resources still remains.

It is no longer realistic to distribute data in"]},{"title":"ad hoc","paragraphs":["formats, since the eflbrt and resources required to clean tip and reformat the data for local use is at best costly, and in many cases prohibitive. Because much existing and potentially available data was originally formatted R)r the purposes of printing, the information explicitly represented in the encoding concerns a imrticular physical realization of a text rather than its logical strttcture (which is of greater interest for most NLP applications), and the correspondence between the two is often difficult or impossihle to Establish without substantial work. Further, as data become more and more available and tile USE of large text collections become more central to NLP research, general and publicly awdlable software to manipt, late tile texts is being developed which, to he itself reusable, also requires the existence of a standard encoding format. A standard encoding format adequate for representing textual data for NLP research must be (1) capable of representing the different kinds of information across the spectrum of text types and languages potentially of interest to tile NLP research community, including prosE, technical documents, newspapers, verse, drama, letters, dictionaries, lexicons, etc.; (2) capable of representing different levels of information, including not only physical characterstics and logical structure (as well as other more complex phenomena such as intra- and inter-textual references, aligtunent of parallel elements, etc.), but also interpretive or analytic annotation which may be added to the data (for exainple, markup for part of speech, syntactic structure, Etc.); (3) application independent, that is, it must provide the required flexibility and generality to enable, possibly siumltaneously, the explicit encoding of potentially disparate types of information withiu thc same text, as well as accomodate all potential types of processing. The development of such a suitably flexible and cornprehensivE encoding system is a substantial intellectual task, demanding (just to start) the development of suitably complex models for the wirious text types as well as an overall model of text and ,'m architecture for the encoding scheme that is to embody it. 574"]},{"title":"2.

Basic architecture of the TEl scheme","paragraphs":["3.1. General architecture The 'I'EI Guidelines are built on the assumption that there is a common core of textual features shared by vMually all lexts, beyond which many different elements can be encoded. Therefore, the Guidelines provide an extensible framework containing a common core (~l 575 features, a choice of frameworks or bases, and a wide variety of optional additions for specific applications or text types. The encoding process is seen as incremental, so that additional markup may be easily inserted in the text. Because the TEl is an SGML application, a TEI conformant document must be described by a document type definition (DTD), which defines tags and provides a BNF grammar description of the allowed structural relationships among them. A TEl DTD is composed of the core tagsets, a single base tagset, and any number of user selected additional tagsets, built up according to a set of rules documented in tile TEI Guidelines. At the highest level, all TEI documents conform to a common model. The basic unit is a text, that is, any single document or stretch of natural language rcgm'ded as a self-contained unit for processing purposes. The association of such a unit with a header describing it as a bibliographic entity is regarded as a single TEI element. Two variations on this basic structure are defined: a collection of TEl elements, or a variety of composite texts. The first is appropriate for large disparate collections of independent texts such as language corpora or collections of unrelated papers in an archive. The second applies to cases such as the complete works of a given author, which might be regarded simultaneously as a single text in its own right and as a series of independent texts. It is often necessary to encode more than one view of a text--for example, the pbysical and the lingtfistic or the formal and the rhetorical. One of the essential features of the TEl Guidelines is that they offer the possibility to encode many different views of a text, simultaneously if necessary. A disadvantage of SGML is that it uses a document model consisting of a single hierarchical structure. Often, different views of a text define multiple, possibly overlapping hierarchies (for example, the physical view of a print version of a text, consisting of pages sub-divided into physical lines, and the logical view consisting of, for example, paragraphs sub-divided into sentences) which are not readily accomodated by SGML's document model. The TEI has identified sever:d possible solutions to this problem in addition to SGML's concurrent structures mechanism, which, because of the processing complexity it involves, is not a thoroughly satisfactory alternative. The TEI Guidelines provide sophisticated mechanisms for linking and alignment of elements, both within a given text and between texts, as well as links to data not in the form of ASCII text such as sound and images. Much of the TEI work on linkage was accomplished in collaboration with those working on the Hypermedia/Time-based Document Structuring Language (HyTime), recently adopted as an SGML-based international standard for hypermedia structures. 3.2. The TEI base tagsets Eight distinct TEI base tagsets are proposed: 1, prose 2. verse 3. dntma 4. transcribed speech 5. letters or memos 6. dictionary entries 7. terminological entries 8. language corpora and collections Tbe first seven are intended for documents which are predominantly composed of one type of text; the last is provided for use with texts which combine these basic tagsets. Additional base tag sets will be provided in tile flrtnre. Each TEl base tagset determines the basic structure of all the documents with which it is to be used. Specifically, it defines the components of text elements, combined as described above. Almost all the TEI bases defined are similar in their basic structure (although they can vary if necessary). However', they differ in their components: for example, the kind of sub-elements likely to appear within the divisions of a dictionary will be entirely different from those likely to appear within the divisions of a letter or a novel. To accomodate this variety, the constituents of all divisions of a TEl text element arc not defined explicitly, but in terms of SGML parameter entities, which behave similar to a variable declaration in a programming language: the effect of using them bere is that each base tag set can provide its own specific definition for the constituents of texts, which can be modified hy the user if desired. 3.3. The core tagsets Two core tagsets are available to all TEl documents unless explicitly disabled. Tile first defines a large number of elements which may appear in any kind of document, and which coincide more or less with the set of discipline-independent textual features concerning which consensus has been reached. The second defines the header, providing something analogous to an electronic title page for the electronic text. Tire core tagsel common to all TEl bases provides means of encoding with a reasonable degree of sophistication the following list of textual features: 1. Paragraphs","2. Segmentation, for' example into ortbographic sentences.","3. Lists of various kinds, including glossaries and indexes","4. Typographically highlighted phrases, whether tmqualified or used to mark linguistic emphasis,","foreign words, titles etc.","5. Quoted phrases, distinguishing direct speech, quotation, terms and glosses, cited phrases etc.","6. Names, numbers and meastnes, dates and times, and","similar data-like phrases.","7. Basic editorial changes (e.g. correction of apparent","errors; regularization and normalization; additions, deletions and omissions)","8. Simple links and cross references, providing basic","hypertextual features.","9. Pre-existing or generated annotation and indexing 576","10. Passages of verse or drama, distinguishing for example speakers, stage directions, verse lines, stanzaic units, etc.","11. Bibliographic citations, adequate for most commonly used bibliographic packages, in either a free or a tightly structured format","12. Simple or complex referencing systems, not necessarily dependent on the existing SGML structure. There are few documents which do not exhibit some of these features, and none of these features is particularly restricted to any one kind of document. In most cases, additional more specialized tagsets are provided tit encode aspects of these features in more detail, but the elements defined in this core should be adequate fro\" most applications most of the time. Features are categorized within the TEl scheme based on shared attributes. The TEl encoding scheme also uses it classification system based upon structural properties of the elements, that is, their position within the SGMI~ document structure. Elements which can appear at the same position within a document are regarded as forming a model class: for example, the class phrase includes all elements which can appear within paragraphs but not spanning them, the class chunk includes all elements which cannot appear within paragraphs (e.g., paragraphs), etc. A class inter is also defined for elements such as lists, which can appear either within or between chunk elements. Classes may have super- and sub-classes, and properties (notably, associated attributes) may be inherited. For example, reflecting the needs of many TEI users to treat texts both as documents and as input to databases, a snb-class of phrase called data is defined to include data-like featnres such as names of persons, places or organizations, numbers and dates, abbreviations and measures. The formal definition of classes in the SGMI, syntax used to express the TEI scheme makes it possible for users of the schente to extend it in a simple and controlled way: new elements may be added into existing classes, and existing elements renamed or undefined, without any need for extensive revision ~t tile TEl document type definitions. 3.4. The TEl header The TEl |leader is believed to he the first systcmatic attempt to provide in-file documentation of electronic texts. The TEl header allows tbr the definition of a full AACR2-compatible hihliographic description for the electronic text, covering all of the lbllowing: 1. the electronic document itself 2. sources from which the document was dcrivcd 3. encoding system 4. revision history The TEI header allows for a large ammmt of structured or unstructured information under the above headings, including both traditional bibliographic material which can be directly translated into an equivalent MARC catalogue record, as well as descriptive inlormation such as the languages it uses and the situation within which it was produced, expansions or formal definitions for any codcbooks used in analyzing the text, the sctting and identity el participants within it, etc. The amount of encoding in a header depends both on the nature and the intended USE of the text. At oae extreme, an encoder may provide only a bibliographic identification of the text. At the other, encoders wishing to ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range of applications can provide a level of detailed documentation approximating to the kind most often supplied in tile form of a manual. A colic(lion of \"I'L:I headers can also be regardcd as a distinct document, and an auxiliary 1)'I'13 is provided tt~ support interchange of headers alone, for example, bEtweEn libraries or archives. 3.5. Additional tagsets A number of optional additional tagsets are defined by tile Guidelines, inlcuding tagscts for special application areas such as alignment and linkage of text segments to form hypertexts; a wide range of other analytic elements and attributes; a tassel for detailed manuscril)l transcription and another for the recording of an electronic variorum modelled on the tradition,'d critical apparatus; tagscts fc)r the detailed encoding of names and dates; abstractions such as netw¢~rks, graphs or trees; nmthematic-d formulae and tables Etc. In addition to these application-specific specialized taSSelS, a general purpose tagset based tm feature structme notation is proposed fnr the encoding of entirely abstract intcrpretati(ms of a text, either in parallel or embedded within it. Using this mechanism, encnders can define arbitrarily complex bundles or sets of features identified in a text. The syntax defined by the Guidelines formalizes the way in which such features are encoded and provides for a detailed specification of legal feature wdue/pair combinations and rules (a feature system declaration) determining, for example, the implication of under-specified or defaulted features. A related set of additional elements is also provided for the encoding ~1 degrees of uncertainty or ambiguity in the encoding of a text. A user of Ihe TEl scheme may combine as many or as few additional tagsets as suit Isis or her needs. The existence of tagsets for particular application areas in tile Guidelines reflects, to some extent, accidents of history: no claim to systematic or encyclopedic coverage is implied. It is expected that new tagscts will be defined its a part of the continued work of the \"I'EI and in related projects. For example, tile l~ltropean project MULTEXT, in collaboration with EAGLIiS, will develop a specialized Corpus Encoding Standard for NLP applications based on the \"I'E1 Gnidelines. 2 2 See Idc and Vdronis, MULTEXT : Multilingual Text Tools and Corpora, in this vohnne. 577"]},{"title":"4.
