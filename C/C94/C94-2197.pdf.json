Most previous approaches are rule-based methods, hi this paper, we proimse to represent user models through Bayesian networks. Some advantages of the Bayesian approach over the rule-based approach are as follows. First, rules for updating user models are not necessary because up<lating is directly performed by the ewduation of the network base<l on probal>ility theory; this provides us a more formal way of dealing with uncertainties. Second, the Bayesian network pro: rides more detailed information of users' knowledge, because the degree of belief on each concept is provided in terms of prol~ability. We prove these advantages through a prelinfinary experiment."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently many researchers have pointed out that user modeling is important in the study of (tiMog systems. User n:o<h!ling does not just render a dialog syst(,nl more cooperative, lint constitutes an indis-1)ensable l)rerequisite fin\" any flexible (lialog in a wider <tomain[9]. The user models interact closely with all other components of the system and often cannot easily be separated from them. For examph,, the inl)ut anMysis component refers to tile user's knowledge to solve referentiM ambiguities, and tile output genera-tion component does the same for h,xical el,oices.","The con<:epts are usually explained l>y showing their relations to the other known concepts. Thus, for the <lialog system it is important to guess what the user knows (user's knowledge) in order to explain new concel)ts in terms of know,t concepts. For examl/le , con: sider that tit(, system explains the location of a restaurant to the user. It might 1)e useless to tell the. user the position in terms of the Mlsolute <:oordinate system, since the user's mental model is not based on the absolute coordinate. Therefore, the system should show the relative location frmn the lo(:ation tit(' user alrea(ly knows. It is difficult to predict which locations the user, who l)erhaps is a stranger to the system, knows. Though the syst:em <:ouhl atteml)t to a('quire the information l/y asking the user al)out her k,towle(lge, too many questions may irritate the user. Such a system is considered mechanical and not helpful. Therefore, tit(\" system is required to guess the user's knowledge by finding clues in the user's utterance and to refine the user's model incrementally.","In the user modeling component of UC[5], several stereotyped user models which vary the user's level of expertise were prepared beforehand and the appropriate model was selected based o1: the user's utterances. Ill the approach used by Wallis and Shortlifl'e [12], the expertise h,vel was assigned to all concepts in the user model. The system guessed the user's level, and the concepts with the expertise level lower than her level are considered to be known by her. This n:o(lel can deal with tit(.' level of expertise more appropriately than UC, because the system does not have to prepare the nmltiple user nlodels for each expertise h, vel.","The approach of pr<.'paring several user models and adoptit,g one, however, is an al>l>roximation of user modeling. The expertise level of tit(: user is continuous and, in general, the unique measuremelfl: of expertise level is not appropriate for some domMns, specifically the domain of town guidance consi<lere<l in this paper, because the areas that are known differ with the users.","Another problem of user modeling is updating the nmdel as the (tialog progresses. At the beginning of the diMogue the system cannot expect the user nm<M to be accurate. As the diMogue progresses the. system can acquire clues of the user's knowledge fl'om his utteranees. Also, the system can assume that the concepts mentioned are known to the user. Thus. updating the user model shouhl 1)e performed incrementally.","One difficulty of updating user nmdels is dealing with uncertainties. The clues that can be obtained from the user's utterances are uncertain, the iltfol'nlatiol( may conlli<:t with what has been hi,rained, and, as a result, the user mo<lel may be revised. The effects of the systtnn's explanation are also uncertain. Further-more, reasoning about the user's kuowledge must be performed Oil the basis of uncertainties. Most previous apl)roaches to this prolflem are rule-based metho(ts. Cawsey [2] sorted the update rules in order of their reliability and applied them in this order. In another approach, tit(., mechanisnl such as TMS[6] or nomnonotonic logic[l], is used to maintain the consistency of"]},{"title":"7272","paragraphs":["|;he 211odcl.
