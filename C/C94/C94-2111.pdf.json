I. INTROI)I/CTION Three oricntalions have [brined Ihc basis o1 Ihc design of tile Functior~al-Semalltic Proccssor: (i) the ti.)CtlS (51' analysis is on discourse; (it) the purlxlse is Io discover lhose elements lhal conhibllle to Ihc overall ltlC'llling conveyed by a Iexl; (iii) the approach is inodular, wilh each illOdllle corresponding to a slrtleltlral I'epl'CSell[~lliOll ]71\"O111 OllC of Several din~ensions of nleaning. 'In order to provide insighls into tile meaning and cfl'cclivcness of a text', stales Hall[day (1985), 'a cliscourse granlmar needs 1o be lil51ctionaI and semalHic in its orientation, with the granunalical categories explained sis the real[sat[on of semantic pattcrns'(xvii). St,'(; provides this Ihnclionalsenlanlic orientation. 2. SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAl, (;I/AMMAR (SF(;) llalliday's systemic-time[tonal grammar (SFG) identifies the shllclnres ;.11 clatlse level and above thai conlribute Io the meaning o1' a text. An SFG analysis reveals 'how and wily' a lex[ means what it does. The clause, as; coxIslilucnl (s[thc lest, ix tile coral)los realisation (fl three functional-senlanlic con/portents: leMtlal, inlcq)crsoilal and ideational.

[n English, lexhlal nleaning is represented by theme-theme ~.lll(.] inlbrmalion slrtlctllles; inlerpcrsonal lllCalling by mood-residue or exchauge slruchlrc; and idealional or proposflional recants?, by Iransifivily strllelllre. While l lalliday idenlilies the clause as I[IC most basic lexico-,prammalical 1Hlil, nevcrlhcless hc iily;t.} lecol,nises and includes in his grammar olhcr discomse Ill/its besides tile clause. I\"or example, I I'alliday's notion of inlbrmalion ut/it in l:\",nglish is similar to wh;ll '['sao (I979) calls topic-chains in Chinese where a topic extends its scm:lnlic domain over several senie]lcc£. 3. TIlE FIJNCTIONAL SEMANTIC I'ROCESSOR The Funclional Senlantic Processor is a Iool to assist in rite analysis of lexis lbllowing M.A.K. 1 lalliday's (1985) approach outlined in his Introduction to f,Smctional (h'ammar lIFe) in terms of Ihelne-rhcme sir/let[ire, inlb,mation, nlood-residue and transitivity. This llarlicular work of llalliday's dill'crs fiom his previous work in that the eml)hasis is on Ihe slrllchlral rather Ihan lhc syslemic petites ofa descriplion of l'SIglisll. 'File I,'SP includes a separate n/odule lbr each kind of slmCltlral analysis. The modules are independen[ of one anolhel-, each llas iIs own uniqlle lcrnlinology and organ[sat[on. Transilivfly slrtleltlre, tor example, inchldes elenlcnls not [bund in inlbrnla/ion, mood-residue or lhenle-rhenlc SlrllCltlres. I!ach module assenlbies a parlial solulion to file larger queslion of wMI is tile nleaning which tile text as a whole COl/Veys. The approach ix smlihlr lo thai of the blackboard method of prohlenl solving. I)itl'crcnl knowledge sources parlicipalc in \"assembling\" a solulion. Edward l\"cigenbaum (1988) calls it '\"knowledge assenlbly\" (vi). The I;:)tlr Idnds of SIlllellllal analysis Ihal Iogelher mouiprisc Ihe I;SI' ale each a knowledge source, a knowledge [nodule. They are independent of one allolher, each has ils own unique terminology and ort,anisation. Whellover a clause is analysed, by whichm:er module, Ihal analysis is saved to tile blacl<- board. Each module nlUSt then ksok to tile blackboard, pulliny relevant intbrmation tionl tile bhlcM)oard Io assist in con/t)lcling ils own analysis.

The outpul fronl the parser will pennil certain fields lo be pre-set, lmplementalion of a bilingual version of the FSP will assist in the advancemenl of research into lhe similarilies and differences belwecn Chinese and English texl structures. While ttalliday lnai/llains thai file Ihree COlllponelllS of meaning -- ideational, interpersonal and textual --- are universal to all lang/lages, tile slruclures corresponding 1o these COlllpol/ellls are, nevertheless, language specific. Thus this bilingual implementation of tile FSP includes structures and fields relewmt to Chinese and English. Certainly there is some overlap. Transilivity analysis, Ibr example, facililales comparison on a generally shared level of meaning. But there is also a great deal of difference bchveen Chinese and English, parlicularly noliceable with respect Io exchange or Mood-residue slruchu'e. McDonald (1992), in his oulline of a FG for Chinese, does not recognise a separate Mood-P, esiduc slmclure for Chinese. The FunclionaI-Selnantic Processor (FSP) has been developed ill .lhe MS Windows 3.11 environnlcnl. Chinese is handled ill tile, Windows environment using PC Express TwinBridge v.3.2. The FSP includes three linked components: (i) MS Word lor Windows v.6.0 (WinWord) as texl-edilor; (it) the Analysl's lnlerlhcE (AI); and (iii) a database facility. From WinWord, the analyst can vicw the lexl, and select clauses for analysis. The AI, a Visual Basic application, is linked by means ofOl,E automalion wilh WinWord. Working within the All thc analysl can view, edit, and save IhE contents of l]elds on lbrms lot each of tile different kinds of slructural analysis. Using VB's database capability, enlriEs are saved to a database. The database entries may be relrieved liom within the AI, or separately using MS Access. MS Access nlay also be used to generalc reporls including, lot Example, consistelll IXlllErns of usage occurring ill lhe dala. 4. TIlE ANALYST'S INTI0;RFACE Tile user opens a document in WinWord, highlights the clause to be analysed, presses a button in tile toolbar labelled IFSP]. The lexl highlighled in WmWord now appears in the [Clausel lexlbox in the Analyst's lnterl-ilce (AI). The document name and tile bookmark for tile selected |exl appear ill tile status line at tile boltom of the AI window (Fig. I). Front lhe lnenu, Ihe user chooses which analysis Io perlorm on tile selEcIEd clause. Once chosen, WinWord is lninmlizEd to an icon and the [FSP] bullOll is dEaclivated. Ill lhis case, lhc user chooses to do transitivity analysis on tile selecled chluse. Transilivily analysis is concerned wilh the scmanlic configuration of process, parlicipanl, and cit'ClHl/SlallCe, i.e. the clatlse as a means ofrcprescnling the processes of doing, lhinking, being, speaking, etc. The clause lo be analysed appears ill the [Clause] textbox.
