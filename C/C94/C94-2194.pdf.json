This reduces the chance that the system will become mired in irrelevant structural detail, and specifically avoids the 'spy novel' style of belief space nesting that is characteristic of cla,ssical normative models. Attribution by default inference allows an individual to be represented as a member of several different groups holding conflicting beliefs, and inheriting only those beliefs consistent with those represented as being held privately.","The results are thus substantially different from those obtail, ed in classical logics [Allen, 1983; Kraus and Lehmann, 1988; Appelt, 1985; Cohen and Levesqne, 1990]. They differ from other path-based algorithms [Ballim and Wilks, 1991] in the provision of semantic relevance conditions and in addressing the need for shared attitudes by ascribing them directly to groups, rather than by maintaining complex accounts of which agents believe what. This allows us to describe and process conversational mechanics withont recourse to nested (x believes that y believes that...) belief spaces, though snch structures may remain necessary for other, less routine feats of cognition.","In the next section we show how our model of attitude ascription can be used to implement multiparticipant speech act processing. Multiparticipant Speech Acts As in [Traum and Hinkelman, 1992], we assume that a core speech act is ultimately realised by a sequence of utterances that ernbody the grounding process. The model requires thai; the definitions of the speech acts themselves abstract away from grounding and provide high level actions that can be integrated with nonlinguistic domain actions in planning. Using our multi-agent attitude attribution mechanism, we can simplify matters fllrther, defining speech acts as joint actions whose effects apply directly to the conversational group being modelled.","Consider the generalised action operator representing one simple core speech act:"]},{"title":"Informal)","paragraphs":["conditions : BbPA b K aAlivea","effects : Bap","This Inform is a true joint action. Agent a is the nonce corporation representing all the participants taken jointly (the live predicate requires that this nonce correspond to an a ongoing conversation). Though the singleton subagent b is the source of the information, the action has its effect directly on our model of the group. From that point propagation downwards to the individual participants is a function of the attitude ascription model, and is subject to the constraints given above. (The system effectively assumes that corresponding updates actually take place in the minds of the conversational participants.)","The correctness of this formulation relies on two facts. The first is that the grounding structure realis-","3Our current implementation actually deals with (mail rather than live speech, and must cope with mul(.iple acl;ive dialogues. ing the core speech act operator ensures the content is successfully conveyed. The second is that if a speech act that has an efl~ct on the conversational gronp is flflly realised and properly grounded, then any hearer who dissents from those effects must explicitly act to cancel them. That is, acknowledgement of receipt of a message establishes a presumption of assent to the content. Note, however, that when the speech act remains unchallenged this means only that the conversational participants will let it stand as part of the public record; it does not mean that they are tndy persuaded of its content, and the rules we have given only predict that they adopt it if there is no evidence to the contrary.","St, ecessful requests have effects on the goals rather than the beliefs of the group. It is crucial that both communicative and noncommnnicative are introduced. The first goal below is noncommunicative and represents simply that the requested action be performed. Note that although the requested action's (possibly corporate) agent participates in the dialogue, there is no restriction that it not include the requester. Writ-ing Bifap for Bop V Ba~p and O for eventually, we have","Requestae","conditions : agent e E a A live a","effe.cts : (~a<~ e A GaBifa@ e","The second goal in the effects is a communicative one; the group acquires the goal of finding out whether the requested action will be performed. The consequence of this is that the requester gets an indication of whether the request was successful: even lmder the assunrption of co-operativity, goal conflicts and plan constraints sometimes lead to the rejection of a successfully communicated request.","In tile next section we describe how OOSMA, our implemented calendar management system, processes all actual exchange. Processing an N-Way Speech Act Speech acts like the above can now fignre in the plan-and inference- based algorithms of communicative intelligent agents. Since dialogue may include unpredicted events, such agents must be able to react to chang-ing circumstances rather than relying completely on advance planning. As each incoming speech act arrives, the agent updates its beliefs and goals; these beliefs and goals are the basis for subsequent action. This is not only appropriate for the interface between task and dialogue, but absolutely crucial for the grounding process.","A typical application task for Noway speech acts in a multiagent environment is appointment schedul-ing, with dialogue systems serving as personal appointment secretaries to human agents. Our implemented system, COSMA, operates in this domain. We model a human/secretarial pair as a kind of corporate agent in which beliefs about appointments propagate up and down from both members, and in which goals about appointments propagate fl'om the hnman up to the pair and from there down to the secretary.","When this example begins, the dialogue system 1194 (see.Jan) has the role of a personal aplmintment secretary to a human agent (Jan), forming the human/secretarial corporation ofliee..hm.

Al-though the number of 'agents' in a nontrivial world model may be large, we only introduce belief spaces corresponding to 'actual' objects about which the system has knowledge. In particular, the corporate agents that are used correspond to either durable social gronpings or records of actual conversations. Individual speech act definitions, though they acconnt for all the agents in the dialogue, need make reference to at most two agents.","In contrast with normative models, our speech act processing model at no point requires that individual addressees be modelled. Of course, dialogue is typically motivated by the desire to modify the addressees' mental states, but our system is free to make these updates on demand. Thus, so long as constructing detailed partner models is not independently necessary, the effort required to plan and respond to speech acts remains almost constant as the number of conversational participants grows.","We have thus achieved the extension of speech acts to multiagent environments, a step beyond other speech act based models[Dols and van der Sloot, 1992; Meyer, 1992; Bunt, 1989; Traum and Ilinkehnan, 1992]. In the process, we have reduced the complexity of the task/dialogue interface. WidgetCorp ~~ ~'- I nonce5 Figure 9: WidgetCorp expands An interesting consequence of not needing to nlodel all members of a conversational group is that it becomes unnecessary to identify them. While in some circumstances this may be an advantage, it does leave the door open to an interesting glitch: without an independent check, the system's model of who it is addressing may turn out to be inaccurate. A related thing can happen when the system plans on the basis of attitude propagation: it can perform an action that 'ought' to result in a given agent's coming to hold some view through social processes, but since social channels are quite imperfect, the message never gets through. Human agents are at times more cautious, and may model delays in the grapevine, but this 'lost sheep' phenomenon occurs sufficiently ofl;en in real life to make the utterance \"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess you weren't at the meeting.\" sound very familiar.","Generalisatiou remains a hard problem, of course. Our system has no special advantages when faced with a question like \"Are conservatives porcupine-lovers?\" Vague questions about large groups require extensive search or some independent theory of generalisation, and seem to be difficult even for hunians.","Related to this is the Nixon diamond anomaly faced by many default inference systems. In our case, when we find propagation paths that will support the ascription of contradictory attitudes to a single agent, how should we choose between them? It turns out that selecting whichever result we first discover we would like to use is a surprisingly good solution. Such 'arbitrary' judgments tend to facilitate the conversation by using the inference mechanism not to seek a reli-able proof but to find the most convenient supportable argument, regardless of actual truth. Perhaps the most interesting deviation of our model from the behaviour of systems founded on mutual belief is the social fiction anomaly: one can fairly e~i-ly reach a state in which an attitude is ascribed to a corporation which is held by none of its members. In-credibly, this also corresponds to a familiar situation in everyday life. Three examples should serve to illustrate the point. In the first place, consider this exchange, in which Jan asks Les to compile a tedious report: Jan: I'll need that on my desk by friday. Les: friday, no problem. Such a dialogue may occur even when Jan will not have time to look at the report until the middle of the following week, and Les knows that the work cannot possibly be completed before the weekend. '~","Secondly, we propose the example of a couple who are jointly but not severally on a diet. When together, neither partner ever takes dessert, and this policy is verbally reinforced. Yet either of' them will happily join you in eating a large slice of strawberry cheesecake, if they are apart.","Finally, imagine that you are a lone bicyclist approaching a Very Large Hill. You might now say to yourself--a conversational nonce of one--\"It's not far to the top!\" Processing this speech act results in another unsupported belief. You can now try to be convinced. In light of all of tile above anomalies, it begins to appear that human agents may be struggling with limitations similar to those of our own model.","It may still be objected that onr model falls short in failing to support the detailed 'spy novel' reasoning used in conventional logics of belief, keeping track of whether Loll believes that Lee believes that p, and whether or not common beliefs are truly mutual.
