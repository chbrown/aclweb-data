A number of systems have been developed that deal with word-level processing. A widely used approach is finite-state morphology, most no-tably two-level morphology (for an introduction, see Sproat 92). Morphological components are sueeessflflly used for a wide range of stand-alone applications like sl)elling correction aM hyphenation. One obvious application is the use in NI,P systems geared to the analysis/generation of text. Surprisingly, they have not been widely al)l)lied in this domain up to now.","A major reason for this is the llrolllem of interfacing morphology with syntax. Reflecting tile current trend in syntax towards lexicalism, unification-1)ased systems use highly structured feature structures as inI)ut. Translating tile output of morphologieM components into such it rel)- resentation has proved to be diiticult. Reducing interface problems is therefore crucial to success.","*Financial support for the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence is provkled by the Austrian Ministry o] Science and Research. We wouhl like to thank Wolfgang lleinz for vMuable comments and suggestimls","A tight integration between word and sentence level processing also has linguistic advantages. The boundary between morphology and syntax is fuzzy. When processing written text the units nmrl>hology has to deal with are, ill it technicM sense, not words Mt character strings separated by delimiters. While these strings roughly correspond to the words of a sentence there are problematic cases. In German, e.g., zu-infinitive or w'rbs with separMfie prefixes ;Lre written as a single unit in some instances and separately ill others.","The prol)lem has boon recognized and seine possihle remedies have been prol)osed.

Sag in press) can be viewed as a mono-level Mt multi-stratal theory Of gl'anlnlitl', where different stratit relate to different aspects (d\" linguistic informlttion, but are ropresonted uniformly in feature logics. As such it is well suited as a linguistic theory for our en-141 terprise.","ItPSG differentiates between three strata--- PIION, SYNSEM and DTItS. Though morphology is not considered in the standard approach, it suggests itself to be included as a fourth stratum by introducing a feature MORPH into the type sign. Morphotactics are easily described in terms of a feature based grammar. The problem is how to deal with morphophonology. Two proposals have been made to overcome this problem.","Krieger et al. 93 encode finite state automata directly in the feature formalism. Since two-level rules can be compiled into such automata, roof phophonology can be straightforwardly integrate<l into the grammar. While this is formally elegant it seems to be no good solution for practical considerations. First, it is not entirely clear frmn their paper how the problem of null characters can be handled. Second, encoding large automata will result in a very large and unwieldy type hierarchy. In general, introducing automata into feature structures and encoding morphophonology directly at that level seems to be too low-level.","Bird & Klein 93 argue against the use of two-level morphology because of linguistic considerations. The linguistic background of two-level rules--main stream segmental phonology-- has widely been rejected as a valid linguistic model. Instead, they base their implementation on autosegmental phonology (of. Goldsmith 90).","This is certainly linguistically appealing. But there are reasons for sticking to a more conservative approach. Finite-state morphology as a formalism is not necessarily tied to segmental phonology. There are various approaches to cope with non-concatenative phenomena--one of tlmm X2MoltF (Trost 90). Also, for a nmnber of languages complete sets of two-level rules do exist and can immediately be brought to bear. Finally, finite-state morphology has proven to be eflicient while the method proposed by Bird ~: Klein 93 seems to be computationally costly.","Like the other apl>roaches ours is also based on IIPSG. Itowever, we employ a different approach to integration. Our grammar is encoded using a unification engine based on constraint logic programming (CLP). Besides conventional attril)ute-value descriptions this system allows for the direct representation of more general relations, as they are required by IIPSG. This extension of the formalism is used for the integration of morl>hology. Thus X2MoI~F is treated as one special relation of tile grammar. As a result, our approach is more modular than the others. While being fully integrated morphology can still be viewed as an autonomous component leading to a more llexible design.","We will now give an overview of X2MolIF hefore describing the integrated system and its implementation in detail."]},{"title":"Word Level Processing X2MoRF","paragraphs":["X2MoRF differs fi'mn standard two-level morl>hology hi two hnportant respects. Continua-tion classes are replaced by a feature-based word grammar. This allows for a more line-grained description of morphs.

The word grammar itself is shnple. Morphs have a functor-argument structure along the lines of di Sciullo ,~: Williams 87.

Well-typed unification of two feature structures is implemented via the constraint solving clauses mentioned above, taking into account type hierarchy and feature appropriateness (for a detailed description cf. Matiasek & Ileinz 93).","Constraints imposed onto feature structures by the principles of grammar are stated in a conditional form where the antecedent is restricted to contain only typing requirements. 5 In order to account for these conditional constraints we adopt a licensing view: Every node of a feature structure has to be licensed by all principles of grammar.","A node is licensed by a principle if either"]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["the feature structure F rooted in that node"]},{"title":"satisfies","paragraphs":["the applicability conditions of the l)rinciple and the constraints expressed by the l)rinciple successfully unify with F, or"]},{"title":"(ii)","paragraphs":["the feature structure F rooted in that node is"]},{"title":"incompatible","paragraphs":["with the applicability conditions of the principle.

The conditional operator ===> is translated at read time via terra_expansion/2 and implements the delay mechanism by coml)iling l>recon<lition checks into the principle.
