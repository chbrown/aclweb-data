We share the opi= nion of those who argue that ellipsis resolution should take place at a semantic level [Dalrymple et al., 1991; Kehler, 1993; Sere, 1993]. We will provide a framework in which ellipsis resolution is constrained by presupposition projection, and furthermore, anaphora and presupposition are represented underspecified in the semantics. The latter postulation is necessary for a proper treatment of VP-ellipsis on the semantic level. The source clause of an elliptical VP often contains presupposition triggers, and resolution of the elided VP asks for presupposition projection in the context of the target elliptical clause. This is an issue which has been neglected in the literature hitherto. The other thesis we put forward in this paper is that VP-ellipsis resolution is constrained by presupposition. Every elided VP is evidently escorted by some presupposition trigger. The cases we will pursue through this paper is the presupposition","*This work was partly funded by the German Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) under contract 01 IV 101 k/1 (VERBMOBIL). introduced by focusing particles such as too. Of our interest are examples like: (1) John kicked his dog, and Tom did, too.","(2) With Betty, John visited her parents, and with MARY, he did, too. Example (1) presupposes that only John owns a dog (in the strict reading), or presupposes that both John and Tom own a dog (in the sloppy reading). Example (2) shows that this strict/sloppy ambiguity also occurs in cases where there is a non-subject parallelism. We use the level of discourse representation for VP-ellipsis resolution, in an extension of Discourse Representation Theory [Kamp, 1981]. For the reconstruction of elided material we adopt a version of Asher's Concept Abstraction mechanism [Asher, 1993]. We furthermore integrate Van der Sandt's presupposition projection algorithm [1992]. Van der Sandt argues that presuppositions are kind of anaphoric expressions which interpretation is strongly influenced by discourse structure. The main difference to pronouns is that presuppositions have more descriptive content, which enables them to accommodate an antecedent, in case not provided by discourse."]},{"title":"2 DRT-framework","paragraphs":["In this section I will outline a proper framework that integrates anaphora resolution, presupposition projection, and ellipsis resolution. Basically, we will extend Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory slightly, by integrating the treatment of presupposition of Van der Sandt and reference to 1784 abstract entities by Asher. What is new is the combination of these three formalisms into one, leading to interesting results concerning the analysis of VP-ellipsis. ])RT focuses on the semantic interpretation of discourses. A major aspect of I)RT is the use of Discourse Representation Structures that hold the seinantic content of sentences as a pair < U, C >, in which U is a set of discourse markers (referents) and C a set of conditions upon them. The full syntax of DRSs is given in Definition 1. Definition 1: DRS Syntax","1. If U is a set of reference markers, C a set of conditions, then the pair < Uq~,C¢ > is a 1)RS I~;","2. If P is n-place predicate constant and tl ... t~ are terms, then P(tl ... tn) is a condition;","3. If (i) and g~ are DRSs, then ~ (P, • => qJ and (I) V • are conditions","4. If (I) is a I)RS, P a predicative I)RS, tl, t2 are terms, then ~(h,t2):(I), cP(h) and h:O are conditions. Clause (2) forms atomic conditions. Clause (3) states negation, universal quantification, and disjunction. Clause (4) defines anaphoric, elliptical material, and propositions and deserves more at-tention because it deviates from Kamp's original proposal. In our framework we introduce the alfa-condition (~:~) which functions to indicate that the information in ])]IS ~ must be anaphorically Linked to previously established discourse markers. It has two additional arguments, one for indicating the prhlcipal referent of the anaphoric construction, and (optional) one for stating the antecedent. So a condition c~(x,y):~ states that y is the antecedent for x~ under restriction of (I). In the case of pronouns, e0 only contains discourse markers and no conditions. But in the case of, for example, definite descriptions, (I) carries the restrictions in its conditions for linking the discourse marker associated to the definite description to an earlier introduced marker. Referential constructions such as ellipsis and event-type anaphora, are not linked to discourse markers but, instead, refer to portions of discourse, and are indicated by e: P(t), where P is an abstracted piece of the previous DRS. Resolution of epsilon-conditions is done by applying the abstracted DRS P to its argument t. Alfa- and epsilon conditions do not c~rry any subordination relations with respect to other DRSs, and neither do propositional conditions. They are, in contrast to the sub-DRSs formulated under clause (3), accessible for anaphoric relations and inherit the subordination relations of the I)RS in which they are situated. Ellipsis resolution is done by a process called C-Abstraction (cf. Asher 1993, p. 249). It is stated in a simplified form as: Definition 2: C-Abstraction for VP:ellipsis (Asher)","1. If c:P(t) is a condition in DRS K and is derived from auxiliary do, then P may be identiffed with Ay.K*, where K* is an alphabetic variant of a part of K.","2. K* is underspecified for alfa- and epsilon-conditions. While parsing a sequence of sentences, we aSsume tile following: firstly, we have got ~ pro per I)RS of the sentences that we have parsed so far, and secondly, a compositional bottom-up construction procedure that returns the DRS of the actual sentence, which is called the sentence-l)RS (henceforth s-I)RS). An s-DRS is in a sense underspecified, because all anaphoric material that it includes is still unresol-. ved. On the representationM level this is marked by leaving the optionM slot in the Mfu-condition for the antecedent untilled. Anaphoric material contains, besides the 'normal' anaphors, also all presuppositioual information of the sentence under consideration. Accordingly all presupposition inducers are marked as such in the lexicon."]},{"title":"3 Presupposition Projection","paragraphs":["In this section we will show how presupposition projection (aild hence, anaphora resolution) is treated in I)RT. The Mgorithm I present is in essence conform to Van der Sandt's proposal [Van der Sandt, 1992]. Van der Sandt's theory is principally based on two mechanisms: binding 1185 and accommodation. Compared to classical presupposition theories, the former corresponds by and large to presupposition cancellation (or better: neutralization), while the latter is sort of repairing the discourse in the style of Lewis [1979]. The idea of Van der Sandt's work is that \"anaphoric expressions are either linked to some previously established antecedent or, if they have enough descriptive content, accommodated at some level of representation\" [Van der Sandt, 1992]. All anaphoric information is resolved (under normal circumstances), conform the following rules:","1. Try to bind the anaphoric material to an accessible antecedent. 2. If (1) fails, accommodate an antecedent. Accommodation must take place at some accessible level of discourse. It has been argued in the literature that accommodation must take place as global as possible. [Helm, 1983; Van der Sandt, 1992]. Rather than using a non-monotone moving operation for accommodation we obey the following algorithm: 1. 2. 3. 4. Ready. If there is a superordinated level then (2) else"]},{"title":"(4).","paragraphs":["Copy the presupposed information to this level, but only if this does not lead to semantic contradictions (unbound variables or inconsistencies) or pragmatic violations, else (4). Repeat step (1). We will not elaborate in detail on the issue which constrains constitute the elimination of possible accommodation sites. The interested reader should consult Van der Sandt's paper (1992) for proposals. We exemplify the projection algorithm with (3) and (4). The former presupposes John as a (tog owner, the latter, in contrast, does not presuppose that, although it contains the same presupposition inducer. This is named the the projection problem. (3) John beats his dog. (4) If John has a dog, he beats his dog. The result of the compositional semantic construction process for (4), given that presuppositions are marked in the lexicon as anaphorical, is the following s-DRS: X2"]},{"title":"o/x ) l johXlxl, ]","paragraphs":["dog(x2 ) of(x~,x~) :ee"]},{"title":".(x~):~","paragraphs":["dog(x4) ~(x,): of(x,,xs) beat(xa ,x4) This s-DRS is merged with the DRS of the previous discourse, which is in this case an empty one. The next step is to examine the newly acquired conditions and see if there are any anaphoric DRSs among them. In the first place we find the condition for the proper name John, which is treated as a presupposition. We cannot bind this expression to a referent, since there is none available, so we accommodate the information in the principle DRS) Accommodation is simply fulfilled by copying an alphabetic variant of the anaphoric DRS to the main DRS. Linking is possible for the personal pronoun x3 to the (closest) referent of John. The other anaphoric DRS in the conseqnent of tile implication paraplirases his dog has an embedded anaphoric DRS, which has to be resolved first. In this case the referent x5 can be linked to xl. Finally we can resolve x4 to x2 because their corresponding conditions do not conflict and yield:","X6 john(x6) --- X1 ~(Xl ~X6): =~"]},{"title":"dog(x2) I I ot(x~,xl) / <xJ,xl):V _ c~tx4'x~)' I","paragraphs":["of(×4,xs) beat(xs,x4) This DRS is fully specified and paraphrases the meaning of (4) correctly: There is a male person called John, and if John owns a dog, he beats it.

None of the approaches to be mentioned use presupposition as means to restrain VP-ellipsis resolution. Source-clause Ambiguity Approaches The first class of approaches to VP-ellipsis is characterized by claiming that the semantics of the elided VP is identical to another VP salient in discourse. They treat the source clause as ambiguous in cases where there is both a strict and sloppy interpretation possible. For illustration, our example (5) would allow only one of the two possible properties for the antecedent VP, respectively the referential and the bound interpretation.","(15) a) Ax. kicked(x,dog_of(x)) b) Ax. kicked(x,dog_of(john)) Resolution is simply done by choosing one of the possible sources given in (15) and apply it to the subject of the elliptical VP. This analysis is proposed in [Sag, 1976], [Williams, 1977], [Klein, 1987], [Roberts, 1987] and [Gawron and Peters, 1990] and are also termed \"identity-of-relations\" approaches in the literature. The most serious problem that these approaches face is \"the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause, one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis.\" [Dalrymple et al., 1991]. Furthermore, it turns out to be impossible to hold 1188 on to this analysis for cases like (16):","(16) With Betty, John visited her parents, and with MARY, he did, too. Example (16) also shows the strict/sloppy ambiguity. Our analysis predicts this, since the focused object is Mary, and the presupposition stemming from too is either with x, John did visit x's parents (sloppy reading) or with x, John did visit Betty's parents (strict reading)."]},{"title":"Copying-and-Renaming Approaches","paragraphs":["On the other hand, there are the 'sloppy-identity', qmn-identity', or ~flexible-copying' approaches to the problem of ellipsis, which abandon the as-sumption that the source clause is ambiguous. Instances of these analyses are the higher order unification and equationM analysis [DMrymple et al., 1991], role-based copying methods [Kehler, 1993], and few posited in Discourse Representation Theory [B~uerle, 1988]; [Sem,"]},{"title":"1993];","paragraphs":["and Kainp (Personal communication of Kamp to Gawron & Peters [Gawron and Peters, 1990]). Their shortcomings are, generally stated, first that they are forced to put additional, intricate constraints on resolution to omit overgeneration of readings. Second, these approaches do not include a detection of parMlelism. They take the identification of parallel objects for granted, or assume that the subjects of the source and target clauses are parallel (which is not necessarily the case, see e.g. (16)). A proper treatment of ellipsis requires the integration of parallelism detection between the source and target clause. Our approach can also be classified as a copying-and-renaming approach, with the difference that it uses presupposition neutralization as a naturn constraint rather than using \"artificial\" constraints to restrict resolution. Copying-and-renaming analyses generally have better predictions than source-clause-ambiguity approaches.

Our analysis generates (assuming that before introduces a similar presupposition as too), when the embedded elided VP is strictly interpreted, two readings (the corresponding presuppositions are x revised x's paper before t revised t's paper, and x revised j's paper before the t revised t's paper) and three readings when the embedded elided VP is sloppily interpreted (here the corresponding presuppositions are: x revised x's paper before t revised x's paper, x revised j's paper before t revised j's paper, and x revised x's paper before t revised j's paper). These are exactly the same readings as [l)alrylnple et al., 1991], [Kehler, 1993] and [Sem, 1993] get in their analysis."]},{"title":"Analyses using Discourse Relations","paragraphs":["A quite distinct class of approaches to VP-ellipsis are those that use discourse structure to restrain resolution lasher, 1993; Gardent, 1993; Priist and Scha, 1990]. These merely built on fi'ameworks stemming from AI of whom the most famous one is Grosz & Sidner's Discourse Structure Theory [Grosz and Sidner, 1986]. In order to identify the underlying segments of discourse and their relations that hold between them, interpretation of clue words (finguistic expressions that indicate boundaries between discourse segments) and the purpose of the speaker is taken into account. Also, one inight need knowledge of the world in the analysis of segmentation. A general problem that these approaches face is that they heavily rely on discourse relations. There definition is \"notoriously elusive\" [Gardent, 1993], and an exhaustive classification is still subject to future research. Although cue phrases play an important role ill signalling topic changes in discourse, in general another mechanism might be needed to find connections which are not clearly stated. The use of speaker's intentions might be necessary but in general there is no finite set of possible intentions available [Grosz and Sidner, 1986]. Another problem is the difficulty of finding a general way to incorporate world knowledge in a working system. It is unclear in how far one needs discourse information for ellipsis resolution. An interesting future research topic is how far presupposition, as proposed in this paper, can support this task. Take for example:","(18) If John beat his donkey, Bill will too, but if he doesn't, Bill won't either. 1189 Although source-clause-ambiguity approaches predict the right two readings for (18), it is unclear how copying~and-renaming analyses would eliminate any mixed strict/sloppy readings without using discourse relations like contrast and parallelism."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed to perform VP-elllpsis resolution on a semantic representation level, in a DRT-style framework. We did so by incorporating a Van der Sandtian approach to presupposition projection. This gave us means to treat interactions of VP-ellipsis with presupposition, in such a way that we do not need any intrinsic rules that traditional copying strategies use for VP-ellipsis resolution. In this respect, emphasis was laid upon the presupposition introduced by the particle too, although the analysis of other discourse particles is not expected to be much different."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["lAsher, 1993] Nicholas Asher.
