Theoretical questions concerning the nature of t)honemic data in dictionaries are raised; phonemic dictionary data is viewed as a representative corpus over which to extract n- gram phonemic frequencies in the language. Dictionary data are compared to corpus data, and phoneme inventories arc evaluated for coverage. A methodology is defined to compute I)honemic n-grams for incorporation into a TTS system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The majority of speech synthesis systems use two techniques: concatenation and formant-synthesis. Building a comprehensive and intelligible concatenative-based speech synthesis system relies heavily on the successfid choice of concatenative units. Our results contribute to the t~sk of developing an eificient and elfective methodology for reducing the potentially large set of concatenlive units to a manageable size, and to chosing the optimal set for recording and storage.","The paper is aimed primarily at two audiences: one consists of those concerned with research on the automatic use of MR.D data; the other are TTS system designers who require linguistic and lcxicographic resources to improve and streamline system-building. Issues of morphological analysis and generation, as well as stress assigmnent based on dictiona.ry data, are discussed."]},{"title":"2 Using MRDs in Text to Speech","paragraphs":["Several problems are addressed in this paper; one concerns tile subtle comple×itics and idiosyncrasies ilwolved iu parsing dictionaries and extracting data. Added to this is the lack of consistency both within the same dictionary and across dictionaries which often requires ad hoc procedures for each- resource. Another issue relates to tile structure of the modules of a TTS system, specifically ill the grapheme-to-phoneme component; dictionary lookup depends on several factors including size, machine power and storage, factors that have important consequences for the extrac-tion ofconcatenative nnits. Another consideration concerns tile nature of the language itself: a language with irregular graphcme4o-phoneme mapping and lexically determined stress assignment (such as English) benefits rnost from the large exception list which a dictionary can provide, There is also the practical issue of dictionary availability, and of pronunciation field accuracy within an available dictionary. Thus, decisions on the use of MRD data depend on many factors, and can significantly impact efficiency and accuracy of a speech system.","Since a dictionary entry consists of several fields of information, naturally, each will bc use-rid for different applications [1]. Among the standard fields are prommciation, etymology, subjcct field notes, definition fields, synonym and antonym cross references, semantic and syntactic comments, run-on forms, conjugational class and inflectional information where relevant, and translation for the I)ilingual dictionaries. Each of these fields has proven usefifl for different applications, such as for building semantic taxouomies [3], [13] and machine translation [12]. The most directly useflfl for TTS is the pronunciation field [4], [11]. Equally usefifl for TTS, but less dir6ctly acces-971 sible, are data from run-on fields, conjugational class information, and part-of-speech. 1","To illustrate, the following partial entries from Webster's Seventh (W7) [15] illustrate typical pronunciation, definition, and run-on fields: (l) ha.yen/'h.~-v0n/ n 1: IIAnBOR, POLO' 2 : a","place of safety : ASYLUM haven vt (2) bi.son/'brs-on, 't>iz-/ n ... (3) ho.m,,.ge.neous /-'j~-ne-0s,-ny0s/ ... (4) den.tic.u.late/den-'tik-y0-1~t/ or","den.tic.u.lat.ed/-,lat-od/ adj The entry for \"haven\" contains one fnll pronunciation. The entry for \"bison\" has one alternative, but the user must figure out that the /on/ should be appended after 't)]z-/, as in the first prommciation, in order to obtain the correct variation. Correct pronunciation for \"homogeneous\" relies on the pronunciation of the previous entry, \"homogeneity\" , and requires the user to separate and bring the prefix \"homo-\" from one entry to another. To complicate matters, the alternative pronunciation for the suffix /n6.-as/-nyas/ must also be correctly interpreted by the user. Finally, \"dentieulate\" has a morphologically related run-on form \"denticulated\" in tile early part of the entry, and the pronunciation of that run-on is related to the main entry, but the user must de-cide how to strip and append the given syllables. 2 While these types of reasoning are not difficult for humans, for whom the dictionary was written, they are quite difficult for programs, and thus are not straighforward to perform automatically."]},{"title":"2.1 Using the MRD pronunciation field","paragraphs":["Extracting the prommciation field from an MRD is one of the most obvious uses of a dictionary. Nevertheless, parsing dictionaries in general can be a very complex operation ([16]) and even the extrac-tion of one field, such as prommciation, can pose problems. Similar to W7, in the Robert French dictionary [9], which contains about 89,000 entries, several pronunciations can be given for a headword and the choice of one must be made. More-over, because of the rich morphology of French","1 Notice, however, that the fifll Collins Spanish-English dictionary [7], as opposed to the other bilinguals, does not contain any prommciatlon information. Although this is rather surprising taking into account that the smaller versi ...... h as the paperback and g .... ([8], [lO]) do 1 ..... phonetic field, it could be attributed to the fact that prommciation miles in Spanish are relatively predictable.","[2] reports on the need to resyllablfy entries already syllabified in LDOCE [18], since syllable boundaries for written forms usually reflect hyphenation conventions, rather than phonologically motivated syllabification conventions necessary for pronunciation. which has a rough ratio of eight morphologically inflected words for one baseform, Robert lists only the non-inflected forms of the lexical entries. Itowever, if pronunciation varies during inflection of nouns and adjectives, the pronunciation field reflects that variation which makes the information difficult to extract automatically. For example, in (5) and (6), one needs to know the nature of the rule to apply in order to relate both forms of the adjective. (5) blanc, blanche/bl~, blbJ'/adj, et n. (6) vif, rive/vif, viv/adj, et n. In (5), the masculine/bl~/is obtained by removing the phoneme /J'/ from the feminine /bl~,j'/ (blanche, \"white\" ). In (6), the form masculine fornr/vif/(\"sharp, qnick\") is formed by stripping the affix /ve/ and substituting the phoneme /f/. Notice that tile rules are different in nature, the first being a addition/deletion relation, and the second being a substitution.","In this project, the dictionary pronunciation field was used to start building the phonetic inventory of a speech synthesis system. For the French TTS system [?], the set of diphones was established by taking most of the thirty-flve phonemes for French and coupling them with each other (352 = 1225 pairs). Then, the diphones were extracted from the pronunciation field for headwords in the Robert dictionary. A program was written to search through the dictionary phonetic field and select the longest word where the phoneme pairs would be in mid-syllable position. For example, the phonemic pair/lo/was found in the pronunciation field/zoolo3ik/corresponding to the headword zoologiquc \"zoologic.\"","Out of 1225 phonemic pairs, 874 words were fonnd with at least one occurence of the pair. The pair [headword_orth, headword_phon] was extracted and headword_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording. For instance, the speaker would utter the following sentence: \"C'est zoologique que je dis\" where \"C'est ... que je dis\" is the carrier sentence. Due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nmms and adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of the entries were extracted during dictionary lookup for building tile diphone table. Similarly for verbs, only the infinitive forms were used since the dictionary does not list the inflected forms as headwords. This exemplifies the most simple way to use pronunciation field data, which we have completed. A pronunciation list of around 85,796 phonetic words was obtained from the original list of ahnost 89,000 entries, i.e. 96% of the entries. The remaining 4% consist primarily of prefixes and suffixes which are listed in the dictionary without pronunciations, 972 and which should not be used in isolation in arty ease. 2.2 Using the MRD for morphology Even though an MRI) may not list complete in-tlectional paradigms, it contains useful inflectional information. For example in the Collins Spanish-English dictionary, verb entries are listed with an index pointing to the conjugation chess and table, listed at the end of the dictionary. Using this infer mation, a finite-state transducer for morphological analysis and generation was built for Spanish [20]. From the original list of over 50,000 words, a few million words have been generated. These forms can then be used as tile input to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion module, in ;t Spanish TTS system."]},{"title":"2.3 Using Run-on's","paragraphs":["A run-on is defined as a morphological variant of a headword, included in the entry. Run-on's are problematic data in MRI)s [16], and they can be found nearly anywhere in the entry. In example (4), the run-on occurs at the beginning of the entry, and consists of a fitll form with suffix. More commonly, run-on's occur towards the end of the entry, and tend to consist of predictable suttixa-tion, that is, class II or neutral suttixes [19] , such as :hess, dy, or -er, ~s in: (7) sharp adj .... sharp.ly adv sharp.hess n (8) suc.ces.sion n .... suc.ces.sion.al adj","snc.ces.sion.al.ly adv In cases where stress is changed with class I nonneutral sultixes, a separate prououneiation is given as in:","(9) gy.ro.scope /'ji-ra-,skSp/ n .... gy.ro.scop.ie /ji-ra-'sk~p-ik/ adj-gy.ro.s('ol,.i.cal.ly/d-k(a-)le/ adv The run-on form with part-of-speech is given in.- side the entry, so it could be used for morphologi.- eel analysis, tIowever, since proton|elation is usually predictable from the headword (i.e. there is usually no stress change, and if there is a change, this is explicitly indicated) the run-on pronunciation often consists of a truncated form, requiring some logic for reconstruction of the entire pronunciation. Again, this may be obvious to the human user, but rather complex to tigure out by l)rogram. 'l'hus, the run-on may be nsefld for Inorpl|ology, but is not ms useful h)r automatic pronunciation extraction."]},{"title":"3 Methodology and Results 3.1 Collecting Data","paragraphs":["As stated al)ove, out of ahnost 89,000 headwords in the dictionary, 874 phonemic pairs,which represents 71% of the total, were found. This is due to the fact that (a) the lookup occurs only on non: inflected words, thus a limited sample of the language, (b) because the dictionary consists of a list of isolated words, it does not aceonnt for inter: word boundary phenomena.

A dictionary of over 110,000 entries containing 51,219 common words and 59,625 proper nouns, [17] was used for selecting candidate units that were further utilized in the set of concatenative units (diphones, triphones, and longer milts) for synthesis. The phonemic string was split according to ten language-dependent segmentation principles. For example, the word \"abacus\" ['ab-o-kos] was first transformed into cuttable units as follows: [#'a,'~b,bo,ok,ko,os,s#]. Once each dictionary word was split, the duplicates were removed and the remaining units formed the set of concatenative units. At the end of this operation, a rather long list was obtained that was pruned by methods such as reduction of secondary and primary stress into one stress in order to keep only one +stress/-stress distinction. Techniques were shown that allow the selection of a minimal set of word pairs for inter-word junctures; every candidate unit inside and across word sequence was included. The same strategy was replicated on the Collins Spanish-English dictionary by [6]. In this fashion, the dictionary was used as a sample of the language in the sense that it assnmes that most of the phonemic combinations of the language were present. i81H ite je* 8111\" bl* Mi abl tik st*"]},{"title":"4 Limitations of MRDs","paragraphs":["The most straightforward way, but in the long run not the nlost flexible, is to parse the phonetic information out of the prommciation field. The )ronunciation field information can generally be ~onsulted by a TTS system within the grapheme- ;o-phoneme module. Additional rules for pro- :esses such as inter-word assimilation, juncture, md prosodic contouring need to be added, since solated word pronunciation couhl already be bantied by look-up table. Although appealing, there ~re two major drawbacks to this approach:","(a) dictionary pronunciation fields are often not )honetically fine-grained enough for acceptable speech output. For example, the pronunciation for \"inquest\" is given ill W7 as /'in-,kwest/, but of course the nasal will assimilate in place to the velar, giving /i0-kwest/. Without assimilation, the perceptual cffect is of two words: \"in quest\" and would be misleading. Again, the human user will a.ssimilatc naturally, but a text to speech system must figure out such details, since artieulatory ease is not a factor in most synthesis systems. One way to solve this problem is to impose such assimilation on input from the pronunciation field by a set of post-processing rules. Although this solution wouht be correct in the majority of cases, blanket application of such rules is not always appropriate for lexical exceptions. For example, as-similation is optional for words like \"uncaring\", in this case related to the morphological structure of the lexical item. A TTS system will probably already have snch rules since they are inherent in the graphemc-to-phoneme approach. Thus, it could be argued that there is no need for the dictionary prommciation, since with a complete and comprehensive grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system, a list which requires post-processing is simply inadequate and unnecessary. Tiffs is the approach taken, for example, by [14], who makes use of small word lists (the main dictionary being 25K stored forms) and several affix tables to recognize graphemic forms, which arc then transformed into phonemic reprcsentations;","(b) only a small percentage of possible words are listed with prommciations in a dictionary. For example, Wcbster's Sevcnth contains about 70,000 headwords, but is missing words like \"computerize\" and \"computerization\" since they came into frequent use in the language after the 1963 publication date. Two solutions to this problem present themselves. One is to expand the word list from tile dictionary to include run-on's, as illustrated in examples (3) and (4), and discussed in Section 2.3. The other is to build a morphological generator, 974 using headwords, part of sl)eech , and other information as input, discussed in Section 2.2 that would be invoked when the word does not tigure in tl,e headword list."]},{"title":"5 Final Remarks","paragraphs":["Although limitations ('lcarly constrain the use of MRI)s in TTS, we have demonstrated in this paper that it is more cost eflqcient to post process underspecilie(l dictionary information such as inflection, pronunciation, and part-of-speech, rather than generate rules from scratch to arrive at the same end point. For speech synthesis, thc data is not always perfect, and often must be post-processed. This paper h~us demonstrated ways we have successfully used dictionary data in 'FTS systems, ways wc have post-processed data to make it morc useful, and ways data Camlot bc easily post-processed or used.","Of course, for any TTS system, the power of the dictionary data can be found at the lexical, t)hrmqal, and idiom level.
