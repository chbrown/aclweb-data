The transformation consists in two steps: (1) removal of empty-productions, followed by: (2) left-recursion elimination. It is related both to left-corner parsing (where the grammar is compiled, rather than interpreted through a parsing program, and with the advantage of guaranteed termination in the presence of empty productions) and to the Generalized Greibach Normal Form for I)CGs (with the advantage of implementation simplicity)."]},{"title":"1 Motivation","paragraphs":["Definite clause grammars (DCGs) are one of the simplest and most widely used unification grammar formalisms. They represent a direct augmentation of context-free grammars through the use of (term) unification (a fact that tends to be masked by their usual presentation based on the programming language Prolog). It is obviously important to ask wether certain usual methods and algorithms pertaining to CFGs can be adapted to DCGs, and this general question informs much of the work concerning I)CGs, as well as more complex unification grammar formalisms (to cite only a few areas: Earley parsing, LR parsing, left-corner parsing, Greibach Norinal l,'orm).","One essential complication when trying to generalize CFG methods to the I)CG domain lies in the fact that, whereas the parsing problein for ClOGs is decidable, the corresponding problem for DCGs is in general an-decidable. This can be shown easily as a consequence of the noteworthy fact that any definite clause program can be viewed as a definite clause grammar \"on the empty string\", that is, as a DCG where no terminals other than [ ] are allowed on the right-hand sides of rules. The ~Itlring-completeness of defnite clanse programs therefbre implies the undecidability of the parsing problem for this snbclass of DCGs, and a for-tiori for DCGs in general. 1 In order to guarantee good *Thaalks to Pierre Isabelle and Frangols Perrault for their comments, and to C,[TI (Montreal) for its support during the preparation of this paper. 1 I)CGs on I, he empty string might be dismissed as extreme, computationM properties for DCGs, it is then necessary to impose certain restrictions on their form such as o[fline-parsability (OP), a nomenclature introduced by Pereira and Warren [11], who define an OP DCG as a grammar whose context-free skeleton CFG is not infinitely ambiguous, and show that OP DCGs lead to a decidable parsing problem. 2","Our aim in this paper is to propose a simple transformation lbr an arbitrary OP DCG putting it into a form which leads to the completeness of the direct top-down interpretation by the standard Prolog interpreter: parsing is guaranteed to enumerate all solutions to the parsing problem and terminate. The e.xistence of such a transformation is kuown: in [1, 2], we have recently introduced a \"Generalized Greibach Normal Form\" (GGNF) for DCGs, which leads to termination of top-down interpretation in the OP case. lIowever, the awdlable presentation of the GGNF transformation is rather complex (it involves an algebraic study of the fixpoints of certain equational systems representing grammars.). Our aim here is to present a related, but much simpler, transformation, which from a theoretical viewpoint performs somewhat less than the GGNF transformation (it; involves some encoding of the initial DCG, which the (~GNF does not, and it only handles oflline-parsable grammars, while the GGNF is defined for arbitrary DCGs), a but in practice is extremely easy to implement and displays a comparable behavior when parsing with an OP grammar. 3'he transformation consists of two steps: (1) empty-production elimination and (2) left-recursion elimination. The empty-production elimination Mgorithm is in-spired by the nsnal procedure for context-free grammars. But there are some notable differences, due to the fact that removal of empty-productions is in general impossible for non-OP I)CGs. The empty-but they are in fact at the core of the oflline-parsability concept. See note 3.","2'lThe concept of ofllineA~arsability (under a different name) goes back to [8], where it is shown to be linguistically relevant.","aThe GGNF factorizes an arbitrary DCG into two components: a \"unit sub-DCG on the empty string\", and another paa't consisting of rules whose right-hand side starts with a tm'minal. The decidability of the DCG depends exclusively on certain simple textual properties of the unit sub-DCG. This sub-l)CG can be eliminated fl'om the GGNF if and only if the DCG is of Illne-parsable. 1226 production elimination a(gorithm is guaranteed to terminate only in the OP ease. 't It produces a I)C(] declaratively equivalent to the. original grammar.","The left-recursion elimination ~dgorithnt is adapted from a transR)rmation proposed in [4] in the context of a certain formalism (\"l,exical Grammars\") which we presented as a possible basis for bui(ding reversible grammars, a The key observation (in slightly different terms) was that, in a I)CG, ifa nontermiual g is defined (itcrMly by the two rules (the first of which is leftreeursive): :+\\') --+"]},{"title":"g(Y), a(v, x).","paragraphs":[",(x) --, ~(x). then the replacement of these two rules by the three rules (where d_tc is a new nonterminal symbol, which represents a kind of \"transitive c(osure\" of d): g(X) -, t(Y), d_tc(r, X). ,/_re(X,"]},{"title":"x)","paragraphs":["-+ []."]},{"title":"d_tc(X, Z) -, d(X, V), d_tc(r, Z).","paragraphs":["l)reserves the declarative semantics o1' tim grammar, s","We remarked in [4] that this transformation :'is closely re(ated to le('t<.orner pa.rsing\", but did not give details.
