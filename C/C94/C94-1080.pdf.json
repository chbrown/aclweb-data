The behavioral specification of an obj~t-oricnted grammar model is considered. The model is based on full lexicalization, hcad-oricntation via valency constraints and dependency relations, inhcritancc as a means for non-redundant lexicon specification, and conct, rrcncy of computation. The compntation model relies upon the actor l)aradigm, with concurrency entering throt~gh asyn- ~:hronous message passing between actors. In pa,ticular, we here elaborate on principlcs of how the global lyzhavior of a lexically distributexl grammar and its corresponding parser can be specified in terms of evcnt type networks and cvent networks, resp. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper, we propose a grammar model that combines lexical organization of grammatical knowledge with lexicalized control of the corresponding parser in a coherent object-oriented specification framework. We build upon recent developments in the lield of linguistic grammar the-ory which have already yiekled a rigid lexical mod,larization, but extend thcm by assigning full procedural autonomy to lexical units. In particular, we treat lexic,'ll items as active lexieal processes commtnticating with each other by message passing. Titus, they dynamically establish heterogeneous communication lines in order to dctcnninc each lexical item's fimctional role. While the issue of lexiealize(I control has early becn invcstigatcd in the l)aradigm of conceptual parsers (e.g., Riesbcck & Schank 1978), and word expell parsing in particular (Small & Ricger, 1982), we here elaborate on improving ils lcxical commtmication facilities by formalizing the parscr's message passing protocol according to actor computation principles. As this protocol allows for asynchronous message passing, concurrency enters as a theoretical notion at the level of grantmar specification, not only as an implcmentational fcatttrc. Correspondingly, we introduce a behavioral description in terms of event type networks which rcpresent grammatical interrelations at the level of actor definitions, while event networks represent the I)arsing process in terms of actual messages exchanged between instantiated actors. The ParseTalk model outlined in this paper can thereft)re be considcred as an attempt to rcmedy the lack of theoretical integration of parallelism at the level of grammar design. 2 ParseTalk's GRAMMAR MODEL The ParseThlk grammar mcxlel (of. Br6kcr, Hahn & Schacht (1994) for a more comprehensive treatment) considers dependency relations between words as the fundameatal notion of lingnistic analysis. This corresponds to the head-orientation found in most modern grammar theories. Grammatical spccilications are given in the format of valency constraints attached to each lexical unit, on which lhe comptttalion of concrete dependency relations is based. A modilicr is said to depend on its head if the modifier satisfies the constraints placed on it. These constraints incorl×)rate iulormation about the hierarchy of word classes (encapsulating declarative and behavioral properties of lexical items), nmrphosyntax (containing Ihe grammalical conditions of the combination of lcxical items to l)hrascs as expressed by a unification [ormalism, similar to Shieber, 1986), linear ordering (stating precedence relations between a head and its modiliers), and permitted conceptnal roles (expressed in terms of a hybrid, classilication-based knowledge represenlation formalism; cf. Mac-Gregor, 1991). Dependencies are thus asymmelric binary relations that can be established by local computations involving only two lexical items 1 and simnllaneonsly lake grammatical as well as conceptual well-formedness criteria into account.","P,y way of inheritance (for a rcccnt survey of apl)lying inheritance mechanisms in modern gramlnar theory, of. l)aclemans, I)e Sine(It & Gazdar, 1992) the cnlirc collection of lexical items is nrganizc(l in a lexieal hierarchy, the lexical items forming its leaves and the intermediary nodes representing grammatical generalizations in terms of word classes. This form of specification is similar to variotts proposals currently investigated within the unification grammar connnunity (e.g., Evans & Gazdar, 1990). t We exlend this definition to incoqxmLtc the notion of phrases as well. Ahhough phrases are not explicitly represenled (c,g., by non-lexical categories), we consider each complete suhtrce of Ihe delx~ndency tree a phrase (Ihis definition allows discontinuous phrases as well). A dependency is thus not trealed a~: a relation between words (as in Word Grammar (lludson, 199(], p.1171, but between a word and a dependent phrase (as in l)epcndency Unification (]rammar (llellwig, 1988)). The root of a phrase is taken to be the rel~resent:ttlve of tim whole phrase, 489 3 ParseTalk's COMPUTATION MODEL Although the object-oriented pm-adigm seems to bc well suitexl to support the distribution of data through encapsulation and the distribution of control via message passing, most object-based calculi rely on synchronous messages and dmrcfore do not provide for concurrency. One of the few exceptions that aim at the methodologically clean combination of object-oriented features with concurrency and distribution is the actor model of computation (Agha & Hewitt, 1987). It assumes a collection of independent objects, the actors, communicating via asynchronous, point-to-point message passing. All messages art guaranteed to be delivered and processed, but in an unpredictable order and indeterminate time. Each actor has an identity (its mail address), a state (consisting of the addresses of its acquaintances, i.e., the set of other actors it may send messages to) and a behavior (i.e., its reaction to incoming messages). Tile arrival of it message at an actor is called an event; it triggers an action described by the corresponding method definition, a composition of the following atomic actions: creating a new actor (create actorType (acquaintances)); sending a message to an acqtminted or a newly created actor (send actor message); or specifying new acquaintances for itself (become (acquaintances)). An actor system is dynamic, since new actors can be created and the communication topology is reconfignrable in the course of actor computations.","The actor model does not contain synchronization primitives, but we assume one-at-a-time serialized actors for our specification, i.e., actors that cannot process more than out message at a time and that process each message step by step (cf. Hcwitt & Atkinson (1979) for expressing this convention in terms of patterns of simple actors). The distribution of comlmtation among the collection of actors is dins dm only source of parallelism. Furthermore, in order to compute complex, but well understo~x[ and locally determined linguistic conditions and functions, such as unification of feature structures iuld queries sent to a (conceptual) knowledge base, we esud)Iish a synchronous request-reply protocol (of. Licberman, 1987).","The ParseTalk model extends Ihe formal foundalkms of the basic actor model according to the requirements set up by tilt natural language processing application. These extensions are expressible by the primitives of the basic model. We distinguish between word actors, relations between word actors and a special set of messages word actors exchange.","• Word Actors: The grammatical knowledge associated with each lexieal item is represented in a word actor definition. Upon instantiation of a specific word actor, d~e acquaintances specilied in the definition will be initialized with actors which stand for the lexical item's morphosyntactic features, its conceptu,'d representation, valency constraints and, after instantiation and subsequent parsing events, governed lexical items and further grammatical relations (e.g., adjacency, textual relations).","• Word actor relations: Acquainumces of word actors are tagged according to linguistic criteria in order to serve as navigation aids in linguistic structures (the message distribution mechanism described below). Textual relations, e.g., are distinguished from linear adjacency and hierarchical dependency relations. Tagging imposes a kind of typing onto acquaintances that is missing in odmr actor systems.","• Word actor messages: In contrast to simple messages which unconditionally trigger the execution of the corresponding method at the receiving actor, we define complex word actor messages as full-lledgcd actors with independent computational capabilities. Departure and arrival of complex messages are actions which are performed by the message itself, laking the sender and the target actors as parameters. Upon arrival, ,'~ complex message determines whether a copy is forwarded to selected acquaintances of its receiver and whether the receiver may process the message on its own. Hence, we redefine an arrival event to be an uninterruptable sequence of a computation event and distribution events. The computation event corresponds to an re'rival of a simple message at the receiving word actor, i.e. an event in the basic model; it consists of the execution of an actor's lee(hod that may change the actor's state and trigger additional messages. The distribution events provide for the lorwarding of the message and are realized by cre,qtiug new complex mess.ages. They depend on the (unchanged) state of the receiving actor or on the result of the computation event and take place before and after the computaliou event. This extension accounts for the complexity of interactions I)ctween word actors.","We define tl~c semantics of an actor program in terms of","two kinds of networks. First, we consider event types","which refer to message keys and can easily be determined","from ,'1 given actor program. Next, we turn to actual events","that involve instantiated actors. Both, event types and","events, arc partially ordered by the transitive closures of","relations alll()ng them, causes t and causes, resp., that give","rise to event type networks and event networks.","A program (in our apl)lication: a lexical grammar) is given by a set of actor d@nitions.

The dotted line indicates an alternative possibility how the seanNext event could have been triggered. Of the two receipt events, the last one taking place triggers the seanNext event (note that both involve the same actor, (mitt, so that they must be ordered, even in a distril)utcd system without global lime). 6 CONCLUSIONS The ParseTalk model of natural language understanding aims at the integration of a lexically distributed, dependency-I)ased grammar Sl)CCification with a solid formal foundation for concurrent, object-oriented parsing. The associated concurrent compu~ttion model is based el} the actor paradigm of object-oriented programming, with several extensions relating to special reqtfirements of natural langtmge processing. These cover mechanisms for complex message distribution, synchronization in terms of request-reply protocols, and the distinction of dislriht, tion and computation events. We have shown how the semantic specification of actor systems can be used for the consider-ation of global interrelatious of word actors at the grammar level (event type networks) and the parser level (event networks). While event type networks provide a general, global view on the behavioral aspects of ottr grannnar specification, the current formalism slill lacks the ability to stlPi)ort retinal reasoning about computational prope, rties of distributed systems, such as deadlock freeness, termination. On tim oflmr hand, event networks illustrate the contimtations during real parses, but do not allow predictions in general cases. Providing a type discipline for actor detinitions may Ix: a reasonable apl)roach to till the method-ological gap between both layers of description.","The ParseT?flk model has been exlmritnentally vali.. dated by a prototype system, a parser for Germ;re. The current fifll-form lexicon contains a hierarchy of 54 word-class specifications and nearly 1000 lexieal entries; a module for lnorphological analysis is trader development. The parser's coverage is currently restricted to the analysis of assertional sentences, with focus on complex noun and prepositional phrases. The Parse'l?flk system is impleinented in Smalltalk, with extensions that allow for coarsegrained parallelism through physic,'d distribution in a workstation cluster (Xu, 1993) and asynchronous ntessage passing. It is loosely coupled with lhe l.OOM knowledge representation system (MacGregor & Bates, 1987). We currently use a knowledge base with 120 concept delini- }ions covering the domain of information technology. Furthennore, an interactive graphical grammar/parser engineering workbench is supplied which supports the development and maintenance of the ParseTalk grammar sysleln.
