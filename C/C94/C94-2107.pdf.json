Therefore the hackward center of the subordinatc clause is tlanak% arm consequently zero subject qh,,,bj refers to Itanako. By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with, the zero subject o[' the main clause 4~z,~bj is known to refer to tlanako, too. This result is neither interpretation a nor b shown above. Another candidate is the property sharing thoery [Kameyama 88]. In her theory, since the both of zero subjects share the snbjecthood, both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topic for both of these clauses. Therefore the prol)erty sharing theory also fails to account for the iutuitive interpretations.","Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one, ill which ,roughly speaking, the important part of semantics of complex sentence is tbrmalized as relations among semantic roles that appear ill tile main clause or the subordinate clause. At the first glance, the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of mMn or subordinate clauses, hr other words, semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear ill the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence. However, looking more carefiflly, we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and tile cons(fronts of main cla.use are represented as local constraints by introduciug the new notion of motivated which is characterized as a llerson who has euollgh reason to act as the lllain clause describes. More precisely, moZivated is one of tire pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate chmse are stated as identity relations between molivaled and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing ill subordinate clause. Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause. The constraints ill main clause are stated as identity relations hetween molivaled which con|es from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles al / pearing in main clause. Therefore in understanding the mail( clause we (h)u't have to be care M)out semantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate cla.use other than a molivaled. In this sense, the constraints ill the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause. The next question is how to represent tile semantics of complex sentence in feature structure( called lPS henceforth ). l?or this, we shouhl write down the constraints about these relations among semantic/pragmatic roles ill a feature structure formalism. Due to the space limitation, in this l)aper we ma.inly pursue the constraints about semantic feature structares."]},{"title":"2 Hierarchical Structure of Complex Sentence","paragraphs":["We pay our attention to the general structure of 3apanese utterance which is helphfl to rel)resent semantics of complex sentence. Several Japanese linguists have Mready proposed the general structm'e of Japanese utterances [Mikami 53~ Minami 74, Takuho 87, (~Ullji 89]. Mikami categorized clauses into three (:lasses, namely 'open', 'semi-open' and 'closed.' '['his categorization indicates how freely the content of clause interacts with the outside o/' clause. For instance, they arc categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero pronouns in-side the subordinate clause and nominM or topic that appear in tile main clause. Following Mikami's idea., Minami proposed four levels, namely level A, B, C and D which correspond roughly to VP, proposition, sentence without eommuni(-~tion mood and utterance which takes into a.ccount a hearer, respectively. [Takubo 87] divided level A into two levels. One of them corresponds to VI', the other corresponds to VP + a certain kind of subject which is called \"objective subject.\" g~unji proposed the more detailed structure, in which starting from predicate, say, verb and adjective, objects, voice, subject, aspect, tense, modality, topic and mood are or might be sequin> tially added to make all inIbrmatioually more fultilled sentence component, l\"iually, it; ends up with all utterallce.
