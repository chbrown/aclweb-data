Intuitively, a treatment of lrunctuation seems necessary to the analysis and production of text. Whilst this has been suggested in the fiekls of discourse strnetnre, it is still nnclear whether punctuation can help in the syntactic field. This investigation atteml)ts to answer this question by parsing some corpus-based material with two similar grammars - one including rules for i)unctuation, the other igno,'ing it. The punctuated grammar significantly outq)erforms the unpunctnated on% and so the conclnsion is that punctuation can play a usefifl role in syntactic processing. INTRODUCTION qT'here are no cnrrent text I)ased natural language analysis or generation systems that make flfll use of punctuation, and while there are some that make limited use, like the ],klitor's Assistant [l)ale 1990], they tend to be the exception rather than the rule. Instead, punctuation is usually stripped out of the text belbre l)rocessing, and is not included in generated text.","Intnitively, this seems very wrong. Punctuation is such an integral part of written language that it. is difficult to imagine natnrally producing any significant body of unpunctuated text, or being al)le to easily understand any such body of text.","IIowever, this is what has been done in the computational linguistics field. The reason that it has always been too difficult to incorporate any coherent account of punctuation into any system is because no such coherent account exists.","I)unctuation has long been considered to be intimately related to intonation: that is that difDrent punctuation lnarks simply give the reader tiles :_ts to the possible prosodic and l)ausal characteristics of the text [Markwardt, t942]. This claim is questioned by Nunberg [1990], since such a transcriptional view of punctuation is theoretically nninteresting, and also correlates rather lradly with intonation in any case.","However, even if we reeognise that punctuation fulfils a linguistic role of its own, it is by no means clear how this role is defined. Since there is still no concise linguistic aeconnt of the flmction of pllltCtU-ation, we have to rely mainly on personal intuitions. This in turn introduces new probhmas, since there is a great deal of idiosyncrasy associated with the use of Imnctuation marks. Whilst most people may agree on (:ore situations in which use of a given punctuation mark is desirable, or ewm necessary, there are still tnany situations where their nse is less clear.","In his recent review, lhurlphreys [1993] suggests Llmt acconnts O['lnmctuation fall into three categories: '\"I'he first ...is selllessly dedicated to the task of bringing Punctuation to the Peasantry ,.. The second sort is the Style (I uide, written by editors and printers for tile private pleasure of fellow professionals ...The third, on tile linguistics ranch the rarest of all.\"","Thus whilst we do lmblishers ' style guides, of the punctuation systenr, is","not really want to rely on","since the accounts of i)unctu-ation they contain are rather too proscriptive and concentrate on tile nse of punctuation rather than its ine~.tnillg, tim academic accounts of l)nnetnation are far from numerous. In the work of Dale [1991], the potential o1' punctuation in the tiehl of discourse and natnral hmguage generation is explored. However, little mention is made anywhere of tile role of lmnctuation within a syntactic framework. '£herefore the current investigation tries to determine whether taldng consideration of lmnetuation can further the goals of syntactic analysis of natural language. PUNCTUATION Punctuation, as we consider it, can 1)o defined w~ the central part of the range oF non-le×ical orthography. All,hough arguments could Ire made for including the md)-Iexical marks (e.g. hyl)hens, apostrol)hes ) and structural marlcs (e.g. bullets in itemisations), they are excluded since they Lend to be lexicalised or rather difficult to represent, respectively. Indeed, it is difficult t,o imagine the representation of structural punctuation, other than through the use of some special structural description language such ~m SGM I,.","Within our definition o[' punctuation then, we lind bro~*dly three types of mark: delimiting, separating and disambigu~tting, as described by Nunberg [1990]. Some marks, the COlnlna especially, fall into multiple categories since they can have different roles, and the categories each per[brm distinct lingnistic functions.","l)elimiters (e.g. comma, (hush, l)arenthesis) occur to either side of a l)articular lexical expression to remove that exl)ression from the immediate syntactic 42\"/ context of the surrounding sentence (1). Tile delimited phr~e acts as a modifier to the adjacent phrase instead. (1) John, my friend, fell over and died.","Separating marks come between similar grammatical items and indicate that the items form a list (2). They are therefore similar to conjunctions in their behavionr, and can sometimes replace conjunctions in a list.","(2) I came, I saw, I conquered. I want butter, eggs and titan'.","Disambiguating marks, usually commas, occur where an unintentional ambiguity coukl result if the marks were not there (3), and so perhaps illustrate best why tile use of puncttmtion within NL systems could be beneliciM. (3) Earlier, work was halted.","In addition to the nature of different punctuation marks, there are several phenomena described by Nunberg [1990] which it is useful to consider before implementing any treatment of punctuation:"]},{"title":"Point absorption:","paragraphs":["strong point symbols (comma, dash, semicolon, etc.) absorb weaker adjacent ones (4).

A lexical grammar is proposed ['or the lexical expressions occurring between l~unctuation marl;s, and a text grammar is proposed for the structure of the punctuation, and the relation of those marks to the lexical expre.ssions they separate. The text gralllluar has within it distinct levels, such as phrasal and clausal, at which distinct punctuational phenomena can occur.","This should, in theory, make for a very neat system: l.he lexical syntact, ic processes being kept separate from those that handle ImnCtUation. llowever, in pracl.ice, this system seems mdikely l,o succeed since in order to work, the lexical expressions that occur between punctuation marks must carry additional information about the syntactic categories occurring at their edges so that the text grammar can constrain the function of the punctuation marks.","For example, if a sentence includes an itemised noun phrase (10), the lexical expression before the comma must be marked as ending with a noun phrase, and the lexleal expression after the comma must be marked as starting with a nottn phrase. A rule in the text grammar could then process the sel)arating comma as it clea,'ly Col nes between two similar syntactic elements.

The reason that testing was performed on the training corpus was that, in the absence of a complete treatment of punctuation, the pnnetuational phenomena in the training corpus were the only ones the grammar could work with, and although they included almost all of the core phenomena mentioned, slightly different instances of the same phenomena could cause a parse failure. For reference, a small set of novel sentences were also parsed with the grammars, to determine their coverage outside the closed test.","The unpunetuated version of the grammar was prepared by removing all the features relating to specifically punetuational phenomena, and also removing explicit mention of punctuation marks from the rules. This, of course, left behind certain rules that were fimetionally identical, and so duplicate rules were removed from the grammar. Similarly for rnles which performed the same function at different levels in tire grammar (e.g. attachment of prepositions to tile end of a sentence with a comma was also catered for by rules allowing prepositions to be attached to noun and verb phrases without a comma). I~ESULTS Results of parsing with the punctuated grammar were very good, yielding, on average, a surprisingly small number of parses. The number of parses ranged fi'om 1 to 520, with an average of 38. This average is unrepresentatively high, however, since only 4 sentences had over 50 parses. These were, in general, those with high numbers of punctuation marks, all containing at least 5, as in (20). Ignoring the four smallest and four largest results then, the average number of parses is reduced to just 15. Example (21) is more representative of parsing.

If these caused the parse to fail completely, the tag was changed in the development phase of tile grammar, but even so, the number of complete mistags was rather small in the sub-corlms used: around 10 words in the 50 sentences used.","Initial attempts at parsing the corpus subset using the nnpunctuated version of the grammar were unsuccessfl, l on even the most powerfifl machine awtilable. This was due to the failure of the machine to represent all the l)arses sinmltaneously when unpacking the parse forest produced by the chart parser. A speciM section of code written for the (~I)E (grateful thanks are due to John Carroll for supplying this piece of code) to estimate the munber of individual parses represented by the packed parse-forest showed that for all but the most basically punctuated sentences, the number of parses was ridiculously huge.

F, ven though this estimate is an upper bound, since effects of feature value percolation during nnpaeldng are ignored, it has been fairly accura.te with most grammars in the past and still indicates that rather too many parses are being produced! Not all sentences produced such a massive number of parses: the sentence in (22) yielded only 1.q2 parses with the unplnletuated granlmar which was by far the smallest nnmbcr or nnpttnctuated parses.

'I'he punctuated grammar had to allow for sentences including comma-delimited noun phrases adjacent to undelimited noun phrases, as illustrated by the rules (15) and (16). These are relatively easy to mark and recognise when the punctuation is available, Itowever, 424 without punctuational clues, and with the underspecific tagging system, any compound noun could appear as a set of delimited noun phrases with the unpunetuated grammar.","Therefore the unpunetuated grammar was filrther trimmed, to such an extent that parses no longer accurately retlected the linguistic structure of the sentences, since, for example, comma delimited noun l)hr~es and compomtd nomls became indistinguishable. Some manual preparation of the sentences was also carried out to prevent the reoccurrance of simple, but costly, misl)arses.","\"['he results of the parse now became nmch more tractable.

The sentence in (25) had 12,096 unpunctuat,ed parses.","Parsing a set of ten previously unseen l)UnCtUationally complex sentences with the l)uncttmted grammar resulted in seven of the ten being unparsable. The other three parsed successfully, with the number of parses failing within the range of the results of the first part, of the investigation. The parse failures, on examination, were due to novel punctuational construct,ions occurring in the sentences which the grammar had not been designed to handle. Parsing the unseen sente,~ces with the. unpunetuated grammar resulted in one parse failure, with the results for the other 9 sentences rel'lectiug the previous results for complex sentences. DISCUSSION This investigation seems to supl)ort the original premise --- that inclusion and use of punctuational phenomena within natural language syntax can assist, the general aims of natural language processing.","We have seen that for the simplest sentences, use of punctuation gives us little or no advantage over the more simple grammar, but, conversely, does no harm and can reflect the actual linguistic construction a lit,t,h', more accurately.","For the longer sentences of real language, however, a grammar which makes use of punctuation massively outperforms an otherwise similar grammar that ignores it.

The grammar only performed reliably on those l)unctuational phelmmena it, had been designed with. Unexpected constructs caused it to fail totally. Therefore, following l, he recognition that l)unctuation can play a crucial role in natural language syntax, what is needed is a thorough investigation into the theory of lmnCtuation. Then theoretically based analyses of lmnctuation can play a full and important part in the analysis of language.
