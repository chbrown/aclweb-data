The segmentation of this string can be either (fl'hc ping-pong-balLs were soht outat sale price.) or ('13e paddles for gable tennis were sold out.)

Tihe theory is that, if a hypothesis can be derived from various types of mutually exclusive evidence, then the strength of truth of the hypothesis can be increased to reach a plausible conclusion.","Two concepts MB[h,e] and Ml)[h,e] have been introduced as the measures of belief and disbelief. MB[h,e] means the measure of increased belief in the hypothesis h, based on the evidence e. M l)[h,e] means the measure o[ increased disbelief in the hypothesis h, based on the evidence c. To facilitate comparison of the evidential strength of competing hypotheses, certainty factor CF is introduced to combine degrees of belief and disbelief as fop ]OWS: csqh, ~1 = M l~[t~, e] - MY[h, c] in the case that a hypothesis is derived froIn a number of mutually exclusive observations, the combining functions are defined as: if MD[h, el&,e2] = 1 then MB[h, el&,e2] = 0 otherwise M l:~[h, el&,c2] = MB[h, e~] + M,[h, e~] • (:l - MY[h, e,]) if M13[h, el&e2] = 1 then MD[h, cl&c~2] = 0 otherwise M D[h, cl &c2]"]},{"title":"= MD[h,e~,] + MI)[h, e2],","paragraphs":["(l -"]},{"title":"mD[h, ej])","paragraphs":["In the case that two hypotheses are established with positive evidence from syntactic and semantic knowledge with the same degree, no discrimination of the strength of truth hypotheses can be drawn.
