The corpus contains 1359 pictm'es, each of which is annotated with a single word or word colic)- cation from tile dictionary. Clearly, there are a great many semantic relations that coil]([ he useful for retrieval fl'om such a database. To narrow down the set of interesting sen,antic relations, we used the fact that the annotations are single words or word collocations. As in memory experiments in cognitive psychology, we used tile annotations as cues for flee reeMl by as-sociation. We then analyzed the resnlts to locate semanticrelations that occurred most often. Based on l, his analysis, we picked the sewm relations shown in 'Ddfie I (which we will henceforth call modes to distinguish them from individual senlantic relations).","The OCC, UI{S-WITII mode refers to typical physical collocation of objects. It. is useful for making \"intelligent\" guesses about what else might be in the picture besides the objects explicitly annotated. As the example in q'ahle 1 shows, tiffs is not Mways symmetric. It can he argued that tile presence of an ax in a picture much more often indicates the presence of wood than the other way around.
