PHRASAL COORDINATION At first sight, analysing nou-constitnent coordination using phra.sal (i.e. constituent) coordilmtion seerns nonsensical. This is not the case. (2)or(linations are classified as non-constituent coordination if' the conjuncts fail to be constituents in a 'sta.n&~rd' phrase structure grammar.

In particular, it does not help to exclude examples (9a) and (gb) which suggest shared material must have identical syntactic structnre. However, once we have started to think in terms of merging, there is an obvious next step, which is to move f'rom inerging of word strings to rnerging of synt;ax trees. This is the move made by Goodall (1!)87), who advocates treating coordination as a. union of phrase markers: '% 'pasting together' one or, top of the other of two trees, with any identical nodes tnergil~g to-gether\" ((;oo(hdl, 1987, p.20). We can visualise the result in terms o[' a three-dimensional tree structure, where the merged material is on one plane, and the syntax trees for each eonjmlct are on two other planes. For example, consider the a-l) tree for example (17a.) given in Fig. 1.","np vp","StlO / t-.","~'~ \"\" np W',. ~\\ \" ....... ll ~ \" ,1 t) , \" paper","v ~ Peter np ciet","gave ~ /, a ' I x x","I \\ np n","det book Fred a Fig. I The merged part of' the tree inch,des all the nodes which dominate the shared matel:ial Sue gave.

There is also a f'undanmnl,al l)lroblem COl,cerning semantic interpretation of coordinated structures (see Moltmanu, 1992 which provides a revised a.nd more complex 3-1) account based on Muadz, 1991). [\"ot: coordinatioll el' unlike categories, as in the examples in (15), Goodatl proposes a treatment some what similar to Sag el; al. (1985). I[owe.w~r there is still a problem in dealing with examples where there are clit[>rent nurnbers of modifiers, such as (19a) or the lbllowing:","20) a. We can meet at the office or in London outside the theaure b 'FNT deliver efficiently and after 5pro in Edinburgh (~onsider example (b). The synl;ac[~ic structure appropriate for \"FNT' deliver eJficicnthd has one S node and two VP nodes, llowever, the structure fbr 7'N7' dellvet after 5pro in l','dinbm~h requires one S node and three VP nodes (or three S nodes and one VP node). The two structures therefore fail to merge since the structure dominating the shared material 7'N7' deliver must be identical. The nse of ordered phrase structure trees also excludes examples such as (19b).","]n summary, the /I-l) approaches correctly enforce identity of synta.ctic structure for shared material. ltowever, the way of characterising syntactic structure using (parts of) st, andard phrase structure trees results in a.n overly strict requirement of parallelism between the conjnncts. We will now consider processiug strategies, where syntactic structure of shared material is eharacterised more indirectly by the state of the parser. PROCESSING STRATEGIES There have been several attempts to trea.t coordination by adapting pre-existing parsing strategies. For example, NFNs were adapted by Woods (1973), I)CGs by Dahl and MeCord (198:1), and chm:t parsers by lfaugeneder ([992). Woods and Dahl & McCord's system are similar, ltaugeneder's system has very limited coverage.","In Wood's SYSCONJ system, the pa.rscr can back ap to various points in the history of the parse, and parse the second conjunct according to the configura.- lion fouud. I\"or example, in parsing,","21) John gave some books to l)eter and some papers I;o George at the point after encountering and, the parser can reaecess the configuration after parsing John gave i.e. a stack consisting of a sentence and a. verb phrase, and an arc traversal by the verb.
