The commonalities and differences in two ontologies are classified according to Hovy and Nirenburg as follows: 1. 2. 3. Identity: The same concept is found in both ontologies. Extension: There is a concept ill one ontology which is missing in the other, but which specializes the latter ontology fllrther. Cross classification: '['he partitioning of identified concepts into subeoncepts differs in the considered ontologies. The merging procedure t, hen keeps all concepts of cases (1) and (2) and resolves ease (3) by exhaustive cross classification.","A simplified version of this procedure is proposed in [How and Knight, 1993]. Here, the cross elassification resulting fi-om nonmatching partitions of identified concepts into snbeoncepts is replaced by parallel subordination of those subconcepts. This re-sults in a substantial reduction in the concepts necessary, but leaves open l;he question of the mutual relation between concepts stemming from different source ontologies. Participating NLI' components can be controlled well by such n shared ontology, but its adequacy as a point of communication in a joint MT systent is less clear.","We have found that it is necessary to go beyond the original merging methodology in a number of ways.

The decision how to deal with different concepts (identification, extension, or cross classification) is based on the possibility of stat-ing an identity between concepts of difl~rent language ontologies. This is somewhat problematic. ][21 the comparison between the English and the German upper models, we took as identificatiou criterion the equivalence of the sentences or phrases which can be generated by the concepts. This correspondence relies on the assumption theft German and English sentences have a one-to-one-mapping and that translation is a totally information preserving relation.

Tin~ 807 precise distribution for strong identical meaning is shown by the numbers on,side of brackets in Figure 3. Union If both considered ontologies are equally weighted as ill [How and Nirenburg, 1992], individnal concepts in an ontology must be maintained in any merge. However, in onr approach we have extensively made nse of an ontology:internal concept union. This is a result of the general ontology design principles given in Section 2.3. The ehmse/PP distinction, for example, which is often a concept discrinliliation criterion in the GUM violates Principle 1 and so this <tiscrim: ,nation is not preserved in the Merged Upper Model. Therefore, leaving out of account the clause/PP distinct,on, identical concepts then amount to 163. The number and distribution of concepts identical after union is shown by the numbers in brackets in Figure 3. 106 concepts are strongly identical and 57 merged coneepts are identical with tire unions of dill fcrent GUM con(:epts. Extension Extension can be Pound in both directions. Because of the emphasis we have given to the EUM, most of the extensions are I';UM concepts which extend tile GUM further. These are 60 concepts, 11 for the Mental-Process, ll Participants and 38 others from the Relational-Process hierarchy. On the other hand, only 4 German participant, concepts have found their way into the Merged Upper Model. Cross classification An essentiM field tbr cross classification has been avoided by the relaxation of the upper model-grammar interface stated in Principle :{ in Section 2.3. For exainple, whereas the cross class,If-cation (liscussed for the MaleriaI-Proccss/Aclion liierarchy in Section 2.3 would have cross classified 2 Fmglish subconcepts with 5 Gerlnan subconcepts and their subhierarchies respectively, resulting in 42 merged concepts, 9 concepts are suflicient to cover all distinctions expressed in tile EUM and the GUM."]},{"title":"Slllillrlary","paragraphs":["Summarizing the urerging statistics, strong identity can be found for 41%.
