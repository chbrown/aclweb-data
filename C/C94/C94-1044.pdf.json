These resources ,are considered to ::epresent the most expensive part of ahnost any NLP system.

NADIA provides re:my tools for the management of MLI)Bs. Moreover, this system gives the linguist a great liberty in tbc choice of the linguistic structures. We first give ,an overview of the project, beginning with its lexical organization. Then, we give the results of our experimentations on this lexic,'d organization. Finaly, we present our current work: the definition and prolotyping of a specialized system for the management of acception-based MLDBs. NADIA is the continuation of a work done for the Multilex ESPRIT project. The coherence checkcr and software architecture have been defined for Multilex and adapted to our lexical orga,fizatinn. I. Acception-basod lexical organization After studying and comparing different projecls of lexic:d dat;dmses, including I\"J)R (E[31~. 1993), KBMT-89 (Nirenburg and 1)cfrise 1990; Good,nan and Nirenburg 1991) Multilex and of Mullilingual MT syslems, such as CICC (Uchida and Zhu 1991) and ULTRA (Farwcll, ,guthrie ctal. 1992), wc lmve concluded in favor of an iutcrlingual lexical organization for our MLDBs. Some of the inter,rational projects of lexical databases are based on a multbbilingual approach (e.g. Multilex) while others use knowledge representation as an interlingua (e.g. KBMT-89 or EI)P,). Much like ULTRA, our approach is interlingual and linguislic rather than knowledge-based.","1.

Indexing in Parax As the platform we used for this mock-up was not specialized for such a task, we have used an indexing methodology lbr the construction of this MLI)B. The starting point of onr work was a smaU French corpus we wanted to index, llence, we begau to index French words and for each created acceptions, we gave a translation in the other languages. After creating an entry, the lexicographer gives its different word-senses ,and their linked linguistic information (the kind of information depends on the language of the entry). Then, the lexicographer links the word senses to an interlingual acception. As lhe number of acceplions is still small, it is possible to select an ,already existing aeception by browsing directly in the acception dictionary. If the searched aceeption does not exist, it is created along with a definition in French and some semantic inlk)rmation.","2.2. General c, ~'ls.~ When developing a lmge scale MLI)B, it is no longer possible to select existing interlingual acceptions by directly browsing through the acceptiou dictionary. Moreover, the different dictionaries will have to be iudexed by different lexicographers. 11encc, it is necessary to define another methodology. The process of creation of an entry and its monolingual acceptions does not change. AftEr creating an enlry, Ihe lexicographer selects a possible translation for the considered acception in a language of the database. If this translation is already indexed in the target language, he selects the corresponding acception in the target dictionary. The source and target monolingual aeceptions are automatically linked to the same inlerlingual acception. If the translation is not ah'eady indexed in the target language, the lexicographer indexes it (partially) and asks the person in charge of the target dictionary to complete the new entry. The acception dictionary is thus constructed and managed by the system and the lexicographers work in more or less the s,-une way as when indexing bilingual dictionaries. This automatic management of the interlingual dictionary involves the automatic verification of the criteria defined abxwe. When a problem is detected the system attaches a w,-u-ning for the lexicographer in charge of the acception dictionary, m~d proposes a default solution.","3. Some results The corpus we wanted to index in the Parax mock-up consisted of 135 entries in French corresponding to a representative set of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs of gener:d vocabulary. We have indexed these entries and the related aeceptions. As we sutrted the indexation with q French corlms, only some of the entries in the other languages have been given all their acceptions. The distribution of the entries and aeceplions of the different languages is the lollowiag:","l~ntries Acccptions [ Frencl~ 135 484"]},{"title":"~ 304 484","paragraphs":["l German 388 509 [~m 394 545 This represents a total of 589 interlingual acccptions. Among these intcrlingual aeceptions, 58 are sub-acceptious introduced by contr,'t~tive problen~s. The size of this mock-up is of the same order as that of Multilcx. III. Current work Our current work consists in the dcfiniti(m and prototyping of a specialized management system for acceplion based MLI)FIs.","1. Related projecls Some internalional projects have already started the development of a system for MLl)lis. We have studied and we nse some of their reStllis. In Fmropc, we have participated in the Mullilcx project (CFC - I)G XIII - EsPRrI\" project) which aims at the definition of standards for lexieal databases systems. We use some o1' its rcstzlts (e.g. the software architecture, some of the tools). Multilex's software architecture, based on three layers (presentation level, internal level and database level), clearly separates the presentation from the coding and the coding from the storage of the information. This organization allows to change Ihe presentation of the structures (giving the possibility to define user interfaces hiding the internal structure). We have also studied the Jap:mesc I:I)R project which has developed large dictionaries of about 300,000 words in bofll English and Japanese (200,000 of general vocalml:u-y, 100,000 of terminological vocabulary). FDR has also developed diction:uies of 4(X),000 concepts, dictionaries of 300,000 co-occun'cnces (bolh in F.nglish and Japanese) and dictionaries of 300,000 bilingual culries (both for J,'qmucsc-l:.nglish and l';nglish-Japauesc) (I';I)R 1993). In EDIt., illdividtml concepts arc introduced in the word dictionary and correspond to the word senses, llence, our acceptions are really close 1o their concepts, l lowever, they do not use a contrastivc relation t() code problems between the languages. The CICC (Center of International Cooperation for Computerization, Japan) has also used a very close organization to construct a MLI)B (Japanese, Chincse, Thai, Malay, and Indonesian) for its Multilingu:d Machine Translation system. This lexical database coulains 50,000 wonls or terms (Uchida and Zhu 1991).","2. Toward a specialized management system A specialized management system for acception-based lexical databases must offer ways to automatisc the management of the aceeption dictionary. It must also offer tools to define, index and manage the monolingual dictionaries. 280 The NAI)IA system has to detect potential errHrs in the acceptiHn database. Fach pHtenlial Error is giVEn IH a lexicographer who is in charge of the correctio,. This detection is independent of the linguistic structure of the monolingual dictkmary. It consists in tile detection of geHmclrie inconsistencies in the relations between the elements Hf the database (entries, nlonolingtlal acceptions, inleflingtull acceplions). \"llm NAI)IA system also provides tHOIS to help the users define, index, and manage a MI,I)B. These tHHIS depend on the linguistic slructure Hf Ihe different dictionaries, Ilence, a lingnist has to declare the slructure of the mlicles of the dictkmaries via a specialized la,tguage. To encode the linguistic informatkm, the linguist can use p,'edefined basic data structures (strings. lists, sets, trues, graphs, autHmata or Typed Feature S It'llcttll'eS).
