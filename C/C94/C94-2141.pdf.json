One of the simplest ways of showing this is where a grammar accumulates the orthographic representation of its terminals as one of its feature values, it is not difficult to see how one can have an infinite mmlber of NPs in such a granlInar: NP[orth: the (log 1 NP[orth: the fat clog] NP[orth: the big Nt dog], etc. This means that"]},{"title":"l~'Ii~ST(NP[orth:","paragraphs":["the (tog]) would have a different value"]},{"title":"to FllLgT(NP[","paragraphs":["orth: the fat dog]) even though they share the same left;most terminal. That is, |:tie ilia - ture structure for the substring \"det adj noun\" will be different to that for \"det noun\" ewm though they have tile same starting symbol. This point is important since similar situations arise with the subcategorization frame of verbs and the selnan(;ic value of categories in contemporary theories of grammar, (Pollard and Sag, 1992). Without modification, the algorithm above would not terminate.","The sohltion to this problem is to define a finite number of equivalence classes into which the infinite uumber of nnnterminals inay be sorted. 'Fhese (',lasses may be established in a number of ways; the one we have adopted in that presented by (Harrison and Ellison, ] 992) which builds on l;he work of (Shieber, 1985): it introduces the nol;ion of a negative restrictor to define equivalence classes. In this solution a predefined portion of a category (a specific set of paths) is discarded when determining whether a category belongs to an equivalence (:lass or not. For instance, in the above example we could define the negative restrictor to be {orth}. Applying this negative restrietor to each of the three NPs abow~' would discard the infbrmation in the %rth' feature t,o give us three cquiwflenI; nonterminals. It, is clear that the restrictor must be such that it discards features which in one way or another give rise I;o an infinil;e munl)er of nOlfl;erminals.

One technica.l (lit t 879 ference between the two approaches is that he uses positive restrictors, (Shieber, 1985), in-stead of negative ones. In addition, both of his algorithms also differ in another way from the algorithm described here. The difference is that they add items to a set using simple set addition whereas in the algorithm of Section 4.1 we add elements using the operator +<. Furthermore, when computing the closure of a set of items, both of the algorithms there ignore the effect that unification has on the categories in the rules.","For example, the states of an LR parser are computed using the closure operation on a set I of dotted rules or items. In Nakazawa's algorithms computation of this closure proceeds as follows: if dotted rule < A ~ \"w.Bz > is in I, then add a dotted rule < C -+ .y > to the closure of I, where C and B unify. This ignores the fact that both dotted rules may be modified after unifcation, and therefore, his algorithm leads to less restricted [ values than those implicit in the grammar. To adapt our algorithm to the computation of the closure of I for a feature-theoretic grammar would in-volve using a set of pairs of dotted rules as the value of I. 7 CONCLUSION We have extended an algorithm that manipulates CF grammars to allow it to handle feature-theoretic ones. It was shown how most of the information contained in the grammar rules may be preserved by using a set of pairs as the value of a function and by using the notion of subsumption to update this set. Although the algorithm has in fact been used to adapt the constraint propagation algorithm of (Brew, 1992) to phrase structure grammars, the basic idea should be applicable to the rest of the flmctions needed for constructing LR tables. However, such adaptations are left; as a topic for future research.","Finally, improvements in speed obtained with the active pairs mechanism of Section 5 are of an order of magnitude in an implementation using Common Lisp.
