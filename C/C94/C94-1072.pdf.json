All system l)uilding took place during the last three years. The special approach of this project is a combination of linguistically sound highlevcl grammatical description and specialized methods for linguistic performance modelling.","During the last decade it has become obvious to the majority of researchers in our field that the linguistically designed elegant and transparent grammars written in high-level representation languages such as HPSG or LFG could not be employed for elficient and robust processing in a straightforward way.","Many researchers have therefore resorted to well-known older methods such as ATNs or other augment-ed finite-state methods, to statistical or connectionist methods, or to combinations of these. Several projects participating in the demanding ARPA competitions fall in this category.","Many others have decided to settle for a compromise between high-level description and efficient processing by strongly constraining their formalisms. The resulting formalisms are usually much closer to PROLOG and do not contain a powerful multiple-inheritance type system; e.g. the Core Language Engine (CLE) of SRI Cambridge [1], its derNative tile GEMINI system of SRI International in Menlo Park, the LKP of SIEMENS in Munich [3]. As a consequence of their design philosophy, these systems usually do not feature a powerthl development platlbrm.","Only a few groups have continued to work ill high-level formalisms driven by the expectation that better processing methods for these formalisms can be developed. Our work belongs in this category, tIowever, we have decided to allow for combinations of high-level grammatical description and low-level processing methods by strictly distinguishing between a general linguistic competence model and very applic~tion-specific performance models.","Our decision was based on some fundamental criteria:","• It, is necessary to build general, reusable competence systems that can be the basis lbr different applications, since the development of liuguistic eoml)etenee is too costly to redo for each new application.","• In the foreseeable future, NL applications will have very limited linguistic competence, where the limitations depend on the task to be performed. They determine coverage and depth of analysis.","• The general competence system as such will not be used for iudividnal allplications because each application type imposes specific requirements on the perlbrmauee model. Depending on the task there are quite different constraints on robustness, accuracy, and processing speed.","On the basis of these assumptions, we took a rather uncompromising stand. We decided to utilize the most suitable and most advanced methods for the development of linguistic competence. Our development platlbrm is based on a powerful typed feature unification formalism, and the grammar follows the IIPSC th('ory. ':these choices were made since we wanted on tile one hand to facilitate the difficult and timeconsnllling process of grammar development, and on the other to save our grammar from the fate of several older large-coverage grammars which eannol~ be reused or extended today because of their idiosyncratic representations.","Since research on systems with multiple cooperating agents constitutes one of the focal areas of our institute, we tried to develop the system ill such a way that it would support dialogue among such agents. At the same time, we undertook serious efforts in research on methods that would allow us to derive adequate performance models from tile core competence system.","We also built a sample application (COSMA) for appointment scheduling and rnanagement based on tile COml)etence model, ill order to test tile grammar of German, methods for dialogue modelling, and eerl;ain new n)ethods for deriving a performance model from the competence system.","In the remainder of this paper we will present all 436","overview of the following comt)onents and methods: • development l)latform including shell, formalism,","morphology, parser, gm,erator, semantics; • German competence including morphology, syn-","tax, semantics; • methods for providing multi-agent dialogue com-","petence; • methods tbr linguistic performance modelling; • tile NL flmctionality of the sample application","COSMA. Some individual components and methods have","been described in more detail in previous imblications.","llowever, this paper is the first attempt to l)resent","an overview of the integrated system and to describe","its parts from the perspective of our overall research","strategy. 2 Formalism For the grammar, tile lexicon and parts of tile roof phology a powerfld typed unification lbrmalism 7\"/)£ (Type Description Language) has been developed. Reasoning is performed by two specialized inference engines, viz. the TD1; type engine and the l~ature constraint-solver llDi.Afe. The modnles are connect-ed via a flexible interface to allow for mutual control. Type System 7\"191; is a powerfifl typed feature-b~ed language and inference system, spceilicalty suit-ed for highly lexiealized grammars [81 (in this vohl,ne). Type definitions in \"I'19£ consist of type constraints and feature constraints over the standard boolean connectives A, V, and -1. The operators are generalized ill that they can connect feature descril)tions, coreference tags (logical variables) and types. 7\"/)1; distinguishes between arm types (open-world remsoning), sort types (closed-world reasoning), bl*ilt-in types, and atoms. Recursive types are explicitly allowed and handled by a sophisticated lazy type expavsiot, mechanism.","7/;)£ allows the definition of partitions and the declaration of sets of types as incompatible, meaning that the conjunction of them yields L. Working with partially as well ~s with fully exl)anded types is possible through the use of a sophisticated type expansion mechanism, both at definition and at run time. 7-791; is fid[y incremental in that it allows the redelinition of types and the use of undelined types. 7'/9£ allows a grammarian to define and use parameterized tem-plates (macros). Input given to 7\"D1; is parsed by a LAMI.(1) parser to allow for all intuitive, high-lew;l input syntax.","Eilicient reasoning in the system is accomplished through specialized modules: (i) bit vector encoding of the type subsumption hierarchy; (it) f~ust symbolic simplification for complex type expressions; (iii) memoization to cache precomputed results; and (iv) type expansion to make constraints explicit, to determine the global satisfiability of a description, and to work with partially expanded types during processing. Constraint Solver NDiAfe is a feature constraint solver capable of dealing with distributed disiunctions over arbitrary structures, negative coreferences, full negation, and functional and relational constraints. It is the first (and to our knowledge t},e only) implemented feature constraint solver that integrates both full negation and distributed disjunctions [2]. NDYq'e does l,ot use distributed disjunction only as a tool for efficient processing. It also forms part of the input syntax, which allows for very compact representation of tire input data. In controls( with other systems using distributed disjunctions, we do not restrict disjunctions to length two, thus reducing tire size of the feature structure representations massively.","~l'he functionality of N1)iAfe is completed by several auxiliary functimls. It is possible to remove inconsistent alternatives, to si,nplify structures, to extract subterms or to evaluate functional constraints. One call also construct disjunctive normal form if desired. Semantic Representation A specialized meaning representation formalism, Aft;t, developed at llewlctt Packard [9], is used for semantic reasoning and as a flexible interface to various application systems. H£1; is a linguistically motivated extension of sorted [irst-order predicate logic, integrating also eonccl)ts from Situation Semantics and l)l{'|'. It provides a large range of rei)resentational mechanisms for natural language phenomena. 3 Linguistic Resources Tile core of tile linguistic resources consists of a two-level morphology with feature constraints, all Ill)S(] oriented grammar of German with integrated syntax and semantics, and a module for surface speech act recognition, all implemented ill 7\"D/2. Morl)hology The component X2MorP, analyzing and generating word forms, is based on at two-level morphology which is extended by a word-lbrmation gralnnrar (described in 7\"l)1;) lbr handling the concatenative llarts of morl)hosyntax [15]. Grammar The style of the grammar closely tbllows tile spirit of HPSG, but also incorporates insights fi'om other grammar frameworks (e.g. catcgorial grammar) and further extensions to the theory [12].","The grammar distingnishes various types of linguistic objects, such as lexical entries, phrase structure schmnata, lexical rules, multi-word lexemes etc., all of which are sl)e<:ified as tyl)ed [~ature stru<:tures. LexicaI rules are defined as unary ruh!s ;tnd al)plied at runti,ne. Multi-word lexelnes are eoml)lex lexelnes with a non-compositional semantics, such as tixed idiomatic expressions, lIPS(', I~rincil)les and constraints are rel)- resented by inheritance links ill tile type lattit:e. The grammar covers :t fair nmnber of the standard constructions of German, and exhibits a more detailed coverage ill some sl)ecilic application oriented are~. Semantics Feature strncture descriptions of the se.- mantic contribution of linguistic items arc represent-ed in \"I\"1)1; and are fully integrated into tile grammar. Additionally, the T'D£ type system is used to encode and check sortal constraints as they occur in selcctional restrictions. For furl.her 1)rocessing such as scope normalization and anaphora resolution, inferences and al)plication dependent interpretation, the (initial) TD£ semantic descriptions arc translated into A/'1;1; fornndae. Sl)eech Act Recognition and Dialogue The grammar provides a typed interface to a speech act 437 recognition module based on IIPSG representations of utterances. Tim assignments of illocutionary force take into account syntactic features, a marking of performative verbs and assignments of fixed illoeutionary force to relevant idiomatic expressions.","Recently inference-based dialogue facilities using a quasi-modal logic for multiagent belief and goal attribution [5] have been added to the system, incoming surface speech act structures are subjected to anaphora and reference resolution, translated into a frame-based action representation, and disambignated using inferential context. The effects, including communicated beliefs and goals, of the first acceptable speech act interpretation are then asserted. 4 Processing components Parser and generator provide the basic processing flmctionality needed for grammar development and sample applications. In addition to the separate modules for parsing and generation, we also experiment with a uniform reversible processing module based on generalized Earley deduction. Parser The parser is a bidirectional bottom-up chart parser which operates on a context-free backbone implicitly contained in the grammar [6]. The parser can be parameterized according to various processing strategies (e.g. breadth first, preference of certain rules etc.). Moreover, it is possible to specify the processing order for the daughters of individual rules. An elaborate statistics component supports the grammar developer in tuning these control strategies.","In addition, the parser provides the facility to filter out useless t~ks, i.e. tasks where a rule application can be predicted to fail by a cheaper mechanism than nnification. There is a facility to precompute a filter automatically by determining the possible and impossible combinations of rules; some additional filtering information is hand-coded.","The parser is implemented in an object-oriented manner to allow for different parser classes using different constraint solving mechanisms or different, parser instances using different parsing strategies in the same system. With differing parameter settings instances of the parser module are used in the X2MorF and surface speech act recognition modules ,-us well. Generator Surface generation in DISCO iS performed with the SeReal (Sentence Realization) system [4], which is t)ased on the semantie-head-drivell algorithm by Shieber et al. SeReal takes a TD£ semantic sentence representation ms its input and can deliver all derivations for the input admitted by the grammar. Efficient lexieal access is achieved by having the lexicon indexed according to semantic predicates. Each index is associated with a small set of lemmata containing the semantic predicate. Using the same indexing scheme at run-time for lexical access allows us to restrict unification tests to a few lexical items. Subsumption-based methods for lexieal access were considered too expensive for dealing with distributed disjunctions. The grammar nsed for generation is the sanre as the one used for parsing except for some compilation steps performed by SeReal that, among other things, introduce suitable information wherever 'semantically empty' items are referred to. Rule application is restricted by rule accessibility tables which are computed off-line. 5 Performance Modelling hr our search for nrethods that gel; us from the transparent and extensible competence grammar to el[icient and robust performance systems we have been following several leads in paralM, We assume that methods for compilation, control and learning need to be investigated. The best combination of these methods will depend ou the specific application, hr the following some initial results of our efforts are summarized. Acquisition of Sublanguages by EBL it is a matter of common experience that different domains make different demands on the grammar. This observation has given rise to the notion of sublangnage; efficient processing is achieved by the exploitation of restricted language use in well specified domains.","In the DISCO system we have integrated such an approach based on Explanation-Based Learning (1~;13I,) [14]. The idea is to generalize the derivations of train-ing instances created by normal parsing automatically and to use these generalized derivations (called telnplates) in the n,n-time mode of the system. If a tem-plate can be instantiated for a new input, no further grammatical analysis is necessary. The approach is not restricted to the senl;ential level but can also be applied to arbitrary subsentential phrases, allowing it to interleave with normal processing. Intelligent Backtracldng in Processing Disjunctions In [16] a method is outlined lbr controlling the order in which eonjnnets and disjmmts are to be processed. The ordering of disimmts is useful when the syste.m is supposed to find only the best result(s), which is the case for any reasonably practical NL application. An extension of NDi,/V'e has been implemented that exploits distributed disjunctions for preference-based backtracking. Compilation of IIPSG into Lexicallzed TAG [7] describes an approach for compiling fIPSG into lexicalized feature-based TAG. Besides our hope to achieve more efficient processing, we want to gain a better understanding of the correlation between 1 [PSG and TAG. The compilation algorithm has l)een intplelneute([ and (:overs almost all constrtlctions containe(] ill our IIPS(] granltnar. 6 Environment The DISCO I)EVELOPMI~NT SIIELI, serves as the basic architectural platform for the integration of natural language components in the DISCO core system, as well as for the CosMA application system [13]. Follow-ing an object oriented architectural model we followed a two-step approach, where in the first; step the architecture is developed independently of specific components to be used and of a partienlar flow of control. In tim second phase tl,e resulting 'frame system' is instantiated by the iutegration of e.xisting components and by defining the particular llow of control between these components. Using an object-oriented design to-gether with multiple inheritance has been shown fruit-438 ful for ttle system's modifiability, extensibility and incremental usability ........ Several editing and visualization tools greatly facilitate the work of the grammar developer. The most prominent of them, FEGRAMEDj provides the user with a fully interactive feature editor and viewer. There are many possibilities to customize tile view on-to a feature strncture, such ,as hiding certain features or parts of a structure, specifying the feature order and many more. The large feature structures emerg-ing in the process of constraint based formalisms make such a tool absolutely indispensable for grammar de.- bugging. Main goals of the development of FI~GltAMI.'D were high portability and interfacing to different systems. Written in ANSI-C, it exists in Macintosh and OSF/Motif versions and is already used at several external sites.","There exists a graphical chart display with mousesensitive chart nodes and edges directly linked to the feature viewer, thus making del)ugging much sinq)ler. It also provides a view of the running parser and enables you to inspect the effects of the chosen parsing strategy visually. A browser for the 7\"DE type system permits navigation through a type lattice and is coupled with tl,e feature editor. There are other tools ms well, e.g., a 77)£2I#TEXutility, an EMACS TD£ mode, global switches which affect tile I)ehaviour of the whole system etc.","The diagnostics tool (DiTo) [11] containing close to 1500 annotated diagnostic sentences of German fimilitates consistency maintenance and measuring of con> petenee. The tool ha.s been lmrted to several sites that participate in extending the test-sentence database."]},{"title":"7 Putting it to the Test","paragraphs":["Cooperative Schedule Mauagement In building the COSMA prototype the DISCO core system has been successrully integrated into an application do-main with both scientific interest and practical plausibility, viz. multi-agent appointment scheduling (see Figure 1). Understanding and sending messages in natural language is crucial for tl,is application since it cannot be expected that all participants will haw~ a COSMA system. Tile use of natural hmguage also makes it easier for the owner of the system to Inonitor the progress of an appointment scheduling process. Each COSMA instance functions as a personal secretarial assistant providing the following services: (i) storage and organization of a personal aplmint - ment date-book; (ii) graphical display and manil)ula-tion of appointment data; and (iii) natural language understanding and generation in communication with other agents via electronic mail. The current scheduling flmctionality includes the arrangement of multiparticipant meetings (possibly with vague or taMerspecified details) as well a~s the modification and can-cellation of appointments that are under arrangement or have already been committed to.","Accordingly, the current COSMA architecture h~us three major components: a prototype appoiutment planner (developed by the DFKI project AKA-MOI)) that keeps the calendar database, provides temporal resolution and drives the communication with other agel,ts; a graphical user interface (developed inside the DISCO project) monitoring tile Calendar state and","APPOINTMENT PLANNER I,~:VEL"]},{"title":". er internal repreeentation_ (.IR)~","paragraphs":["P,I A NAGEMENT MACIIINEItY SCANNER 5AR 5NL (standardized) natural langoage NL E-~a.,dL E-MAa WRAPPER AND SCANNER INTEI(FACE"]},{"title":"1 1 T","paragraphs":["figure 1: l{ongh sketch of the DISCO system in its application to the COSMA scenario.

The sys-439 tem is implemented in Common Lisp and runs on Sun and liP workstations. Some tools and peripheral components are coded in C. A port of the system to another hardware platform (Apple Macintosh) is currently being carried out. The total size of the system is about 100,000 lines of code. Parts of the system were demonstrated at several conferences, at trade fairs and on other occasions.","The work will be continued in two smaller projects. First of all we plan to extend the system's linguistic competence of German. The diagnostic tool Di-To will be expanded in joint work with other groups to provide an instrument for measuring progress and for comparing grammars. We will also continue work on building up dialogue competence. The application demonstrator will be further developed in collabora-tion with other projects at the DFKI.","In the area of performance modelling, we will continue exploring different approaches for control, compilation, and competence-based learning in parallel. At this point nobody can really foresee which strategy or combination of strategies will yield the best practical results. As we pointed out in the introduc-tion, different application types will require different performance models. IIigh priority is given to the integration of statistical methods in all pursued approaches, since in contrast to competence modelling, statistical data are essential for developing adequate performance models.
