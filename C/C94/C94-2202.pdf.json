If we take the construction heavy smoker in English and attempt to translate it into French and German, we find that a literal translation of heavy yields the wrong result, since the concept expressed by the adjective (something like ' excess:i_ve ' ) is translated by grand (large) in French and stark (strong) in German. We observe then that in some sense the adjectives stark, grand and heavy are equivalent in the collocational context, but that this is of course not typically the case in otber contexts, ef grande boite, starke Schachtel and heavy box, where the adjectives could hardly be viewed as equiwdent. It seems then that adjectives which are not literal translations of one another may share meaning properties specifically in the collocational context.","How then can we specify this special equivalence in the machine translation dictionary? The answer seems to lie in addressing the concept which underlies the union of adjective and noun in these three cases, i.e., intensification, and hence establish a single meaning representation tbr the adjectives which can be viewed as an interlingual pivot for translation.","Collocations have been studied by computational linguists in different contexts. For instance, there is a substantial body of papers on the extraction of \"frequently co-occurring words\" from corpora using statistical methods (e.g., (Choueka et al., 1983), (Church and Hanks, 1989), (Smadja, 1993) to list only a few). These authors focus on techniques for providing material that can be used in other processing tasks such as","x The research rcpmlcd in this paper was undmtaken as the project \"Collocations and the Lexicalisation of Semantic Operations\" (ET-10/75). Financial contributions weir by the Commission of the European Community, Association Suissetra (Geneva) and Oxford University Press. word sense disambiguation, information retrieval, natural language generation and so on. Also, the use of collocations in different applications has been discussed by various authors ((McRoy, 1992), (Pnstejovsky et al., 1992), (Smadja and McKeown, 1990) etc.). However, collocations are not only considered usefnl, but also a problem both in certain applications (e.g. generation, (Nirenburg et al., 1988), machine translation, (Heid and Raab, 1989)) and fiom a more theoretical point of view (e.g. (Abeill6 and Schabes, 1989), (Krenn and Erbach, to appear)).","We have been concerned with investigating the lexical .['unctions (IJTs) of Mel'0,uk (Mel'6uk and Zolkovsky, 1984) as a candidate interllngual device for tbe translation of adjectival and verbal collocates. Our work is related to research by (Heid and Raab, /989). In some respects it is an extension of some of their suggestions. Our work differs fi'om theirs in scope and also in the exploration of wtrious other directions."]},{"title":"2 Representation","paragraphs":["The use we make of lexical functions as interlingual representations, does not respect their original Mel'~.ukian interpretation. Furthermore, we have transferred them from their context in the Meaning-Text Theory to a different theoretical setting. We have embedded the concept in an HPSG-like grammar theory? In this section we review this operation. First we consider the features of Mel'~:nk's treatment that we have wanted to preserve. Next we show how they have been imported into the HPSG fi'amework."]},{"title":"2.1 Collocations and LFs","paragraphs":["In Mel'~nk's Explanatory Combinatory Dictionary (ECD, see (Mel'~uk et al., 1984)), expressions such as uneJerme intention, une rdsistance acharnde, un argument de poids, un bruit it~fernal and donner une lefon, faire un pas, commetre un crime are described in the lexical combinatorics zone. These \"expressions plus ou moins fig6es\" will be called 'collocations'. They are considered to consist of two parts -- the base and the collocate. In the examples above, the nouns are the bases and the adjectives and the verbs are the collocates. The idea that all adjective collocates and all the verb 2Head Drivt~n Phrase SlltlCItlrc granllllar, see (Pollard and Sag, 1987), (Pollard and Sag, to appear). For another treatment ,:ff collo cations in HPSG, see (Krenn and ltrbach, to appear). 1240 collocates share an important meaning component --- roughly paraphrasable as intense and do respectively -- and the fact that the adjectives and verbs are not interchangeable but are restricted with this meaning to the accompanying nouns, is coded in the dictionary using lcxical functions (in this case Magn and Oper).","Each article in the ECD describes what is called a 'lexeme': a word in some specflic reading. In the lexical combinatorics zone, we lind a list of the lexical funclions that are relevant to this particular lexeme. Each lexical function is followed by one or more lexcrees (the result or value of the function applied to tile head word). The idea is that each combination of the argument with one of the values of the function forms a collocation in our terminology. The argument corresponds to tile base and each value is a collocate. The |ollowing fcatures of this representation are important to us.","• l,exical functions are used to represent an important syutactico-semantic relation between tile base and the collocate.","• The restricted combinatorial potential of the collocate lexcme is accounted for by listing it at each base with which it can occur.","The secund of these characteristics points out that the collocational restriction is seen as a purely lexical, idiosyncratic one: all collocations are explicitly listed.","One other aspect of collocations which we have to deal with is the relation between the collocate lexeme and its freely occurring counterpart. Collocate lcxemes often differ in some respects from their literal variants while sharing other properties. Mel'6uk deals with this by including in the ECD an entry for the free variant and putting tile collocate-specific information in the entry for the base (with the result of the lexical functions). The fill entry of the eolh)cate is the result of taking the entry for the free variant and overwriting it with the information provided at the base."]},{"title":"2.2 Collocations in HPSG","paragraphs":["The three aspects of Mel'6uk's analysis we wanted to encode in HPSG were the following. Coding the base-collocate relation in the lexicon.","• Choosing the level at which [cxical functions will be situated.","• Relating the collocate information to the free wniant entry.","We have provided straightforward solutions to these problems. For tire first problem we have taken over the ECD architecture rather directly, by creating a dedicated 'collocates' field in the entry t)r bases which contains all the relevant collocates. As far as the second problem is concerned, the obvious place to put lcxical funclions is in the semantic reprcscntation provided by HPSG. There are wtrious reasons for this. One is that 13;s arc used in lhe deep syntax level in Mel'6uk's model, a level oriented towards meaning. Another reason is that this level seems most appropriate to be used in transfer/translation and because we want to use lexical functions in transfer, this is where they should be. In contrast to the ECD, the meaning of the collocate is represented by the lexical function only.","The following is an example of the entry for criticism with the encoding of strong as a collocate, a We use SEM_IND as all abbreviation for the feature path SEM.CONT.INI).","PHON criticism REST {cl'iticislll([~)}","COLLS { SEM_IND VAIl [~' } REST {Magn(~l~)}","Just as in the ECD the base contains a specific zone in which the collocates are listed. In our case, the feature 'COLLS' has a set of lexical entries as its value.","Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexical function in its semantics field. In this representation the lexical function is chosen as the real semantic value of the collocate. One should read the feature structure as specifying that the semantics of strong (as a collocate) is the predicate Magn([~).","The collocate subentry only provides partial information. In fitct, it provides only the intbrmation that is specific to the occurrence of strong in its combination with criticism. In this case only the semantics is given. We further assume that the lexicon also contains a 'super-entry' which provides all the information that is shared by all the diflerent occurrences of strong. This entry is where the variable Sstrong points to. Of course, other architectures that try to avoid redundant specification of information are equally possible. For instance if one assumes a mechanism of default unification, one can have Sstrong refer to the full entry describing 'strong' in say its ordinary use, and have the values that are particular to the collocational strong overwrite the values provided in the ordinary entry, as in Mel'~uk's proposal."]},{"title":"Collocations, Rules and Principles","paragraphs":["So far, we have not specified in what way one gets flom the lexical entries for the base and the collocate to the representation of the collocational expression.","ill HPSG, tile descriptions of complex expressions arc constrained by principles. We will assume that collocations are snbject to the same constraints. The ordinary rules of combination (combining adjectives and nouns, for instance) thus account for lnost of the properties of the collocational combination. However, we are still left with the typical 'collocational restriction' which nceds to be accounted for.","We havc therefore addcd a principle which says that constructions that are analysed as collocations (indi cated by tile type COLI.OCATION) are either head-adjunct structure or head-complement structures with specific rcstrietions holding between the head anti the adjunct or","aNoticc that hcrc we use a simple VCl'Sion of HPSG based on (Pollard and Sag, 1987) whereas the actual ilnplmncntation was based on (Pollard and Sag, to appear). 1241 the head and the complement respectively. Let's consider the former case 4, illustrated by the heavy smoker example, The adjunct daughter will contain the adjective collocate. In such collocational constructions the collocate adjuncts have to be 'licensed' by the noun or the head daughter. This is implemented by requiring that the collocates field (C'OI,LS) of the head daughter contains a reference to a lexical entry that is compatible with the adjunct daughter. In the literal reading of an expression such as heavy smoker, the phrase will not be analysed as a COLL.OCATION and the principle does not apply.
