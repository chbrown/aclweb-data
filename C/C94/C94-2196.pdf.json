While the AWM model is extremely sin> pie, [,andauer showed thai it could be pm'ameterized lo 1il many empirical resells on human memory and learning [Baddeley, 19861. AWM consists of a three dimensional slsace in which propositions acquired Dora perceiving the world are stored in chronological sequence according 1o tile localion o1' a moving memory pointef. The sequence of memory loci iised lof slotage constitutes a fI.Itldolll walk lhrough memory wilh each loci a shorl dislance lfonl tile previous one.

Search is restricted to a particular se,'u'ch radius: radius is defined in Hiunming distance. For ex~unple if the current memory pointer loci is (0 0 (1), the loci dist~mce 1 away would be (0 1 0) (0 -1 0) (0 0 l) (0 0 - 1) (- 1 0 0) (1 0 0). The actual locations are cldculated modulo the memory size. The limit on the search radius defines the capacity of attention/working memory and hence defines which stored beliefs and intentions are SAI ,IENT.","Thc radius of tile search sphere in the AWM model is used as the par,'uneter for Design-World agents' resource-bound on attentional capacity. In the experiments below, memory is 16x16x16 and tile radius parmneler v~n'ies between 1 and 16, where AWM of 1 gives severely attention limited agents imd AWM of 16 means that everything an agent knows is accessible. 3 This parluneter lets us distinguish between an agent's ability to access all the inlimnation stored in its memory, lind the effort involved in doing so.","The advantages of the AWM model is that it was shown to reproduce, in simulation, mlmy results on human memory ~md lem'ning. Because search st~n'ts from the current pointer location, items that have been stored most recently are more likely to be retrieved, predicting recency effects [BMdeley, 19861. Because items that are stored in multiple locations are more likely to be retrieved, tbe model predicts fiequency effects [Hiutzmmm and Block, 1971 I. Because items are stored in chrono-IogicN sequence, the model produces natural associativity effects [Landaner, 19751. Because deliberation and means-end re~tsoning can only operate on salient belietls, limited attention produces a concomitlmt inl)rential limitation, i.e. if a belief is nol salient it cannot be used in deliberation or mcans-end-reltsoniug. This means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plansible cognitive basis. Agents can both fail to access a belief that would idlow them to produce ,an optim~d plan, its well as make a mistake in pl~mning if a belief about bow the world has changed its a result of pllmning is not sldicnt. I)epending on the preceding discourse, and the agent's attentionld capacity, the propositions that im agent knows may or may not be salient when a proposed is made.","Another hypothetical riveter was the relative cost of retrievld and communication. AWM ~dso gives ns a way to measure tile nmnber of retriev~ds from memory in terms of tile number of locations searched to find a proposition. The iunount of effort required li)r each retrieval step is a parmnetel, its is tile cost of each inference step lind the cost of each communicated message. These cost parluneters supporl modeling v~uious cognilive mchitectures, e.g. vmying tile cost of retrieved models different assumptions ahout memory. For example, if retrieval is free then ~dl items in working memory me instfmtly accessible, as they would be if they were stored in registers with litst p~uallel access. If AWM is set to 16, but relrievzd isn't free, tile model approximates slow spreading","3The size of memory was determined as adequate for pro ducing the desired level ~1' variation in tile current task across all the experimental variables, while slill making it possible to I'1.1 n a large iltlnlher el\" simtllalions over night wherl agents have access to all of their memory.

If AWM is set lower than 16 ~md retrievld isn't liee, then we model slow spreading activation with a timeout when e/fort exceeds a certain ~unount, so that im agent does not have the ability to access all of memory.","It does not make sense to fix absolute v~dues li)r the retrievld, inference lind communication cost plu~uncters in relation to human processing. However, Design-World supports exploring issues about the relative costs of vlu'- ions processes. These relative costs might v,'u'y depending,on the language that the agents are communicating with, properties of the communication channel, how smtu't tile agents ,arc, how much time they have, lind what the demands of the ti~sk are [Norm~m and Bobrow, 1975].

Explicit Warrant is detrimental if Communication is Expensive If we ch~mge the relative cosls of the dillerent processes in the siluation, we change whether a strategy is benelicial. Figure 5 shows that if connnnnication cost is 10, ~md inlerence and rolrieval ~u'e li'ee, then the Explicit-Wlu'i'~nll strategy is DI,ITRIMI]N'IAL (KS for AWM 1 to 5 > .23, p< .01). This is because the Explicit-Warr~mt slralegy increases the number of ntter~mces required to perform Ihe task; it doubles the number of messages in every proposal. If communication is expensive compared to retrieval, communication cost can dominate the other benelits. l!;xplicit Warrant Achieves a High Level of Agreement If we change lhe dolinition of success in the ta:sk, we change whether a slrategy is benelicial. When the l&sk is Zero-Nouiilatching-Beliefs, the Explicit-W~u'ranl strategy is beneficial oven if retrieval is fiee (KS > .23 for AWM ll'onl 2 lo 11, p < .01)The warranl inl]Jrnlation that is redundantly provided is exactly tilt inlk)rmation that is needed in order to achieve inatching beliel\\s about Ihe warranls for intended actions. Tile strategy virtually gu~u~nllees thai the agenls will agree on the re&sons l(/l' carrying onl a particular course of action. The fact that relrieval is indclcrminate produces this effect; a simihit resnll is oblained when wm'r~mls are required and relriewll costs someihing.","To my great surprise, Ihe benelicial effect of Explicit-W~uralll for the Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs task is so robust thal even if communication cost is 10 and reirieval and inference are fl+ee, Explicil-Warrant is better than AII-hnplicit at AWM of 3 •.. 11 (KS > .23, p < .0l). See ligure 6. In other words, even when every extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 poinls, if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents using Explicit-W~u'rant do belier. Contrasl ligure 6 with the Standard t~tsk ~md s~une cost p~n'amelers in 5.","These result suggesls thai including w~u'rants is highly effective when agents must agree on a specilic w~ua~u/t, if lhey are atlenlion-limited to any extent. 5 (~tlnclllsion This paper has discussed an iuslaiice of a general probloin in tile design of convorsalional agents: when lo inchido optional infornlation.

The Design-World environment is b~tsed on a cognitive model of limited attention ~md supports experimenls on the interaction of discourse strategies with agents' cognitive limitations. The use of the method and the focns of lhis wtnk are novel: previous work has l~)CliSed Oil determining nnderlying mechanisnls £~r cooperative strategies rather than on investigating when a slrategy is elIective.","To my knowledge, no previous work on di;dogue l/~ts ever argued that conversational agents' resonroe limits are a lnajor factor in determining ¢IIective conversational strategies in collaboration. Tim resulls presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot be delhied in the abslracl, but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue. If one agent has limited working memory, then the ()thor agenl can make the di~doguc go more slnoothly by adopting a strategy that makes deliberative premises salient. In other words, slrategies ~ue cooperative for certain conversational p;u'tners, in/der particular task delinitions, lor p~uticul~u communicalion situations.","Here we compared two discourse strategies: All-hnplicit ~ul(l Explicit-Warr~mh Explicit-W;uranl is a type of discourse stralegy called ~m Attelition strategy in [W;dkel; 1993] because its main lunction is to manipulate agents' altenlional slate. Elsewhere we show 1210 that (1) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when in-ferential complexity is higher Ihall in the Standard \"l,u,~k [R~unbow and Walker, 1994; Walker, 1994al; (2) IRUs that make intL'rences explicit can help inlbrence limited agents perlorm as well as logic;ally omniscient ones I Walker, 199311.","Although much work remains to be done, there is reason to believe that these results are (Iomsdn independent.
