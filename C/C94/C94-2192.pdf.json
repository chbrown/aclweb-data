According to Mmm and Thomps(m [Malta and Thompson, 1987], subject matter relations are those whose intended effect is that the reader recogldses the relal;ion in question and presentational relations are those whose intended eft'cot is to increase some inclination in the reader.

Ilalliday and llasan [llalli(lay and llasan, 1985] identitled a set of linguistic devices for linking one part of a text 1,o another, such as reJcrcnce, subslihtlion and ellipsis, conjuncliou, and [exical cohesion.","From the view point of text processing, these linguist, it devices can be used as cues tor segment.ing a text into structural units (Satellite and Nucleus).
