The statistical approach involves the following: alignment of bilingual texts at the sentence level nsing statistical techniques (e.g. Brown, Lai and Mercer (1991), Gale and Church (1993), Chen (1993), and Kay and RSscheisen (1993)), statistical machine translation models (e.g. Brown, Cooke, Pietra, Pietra et al. (1990)), finding character-level / word-level / phrase-level correspondences from bilingual texts (e.g. Gale and Church (1991), Church (1993), and Kupiec (1993)), and word sense disambiguation for MT (e.g. Dagan, Itai and Schwall (1991)). In general, the statistical approach does not use existing hand-written bilingual dictionaries, and depends solely upon statistics. For example, sentence alignment of bilingual texts are performed just by measuring sentence lengths in words or in characters (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993), or by statistically estimating word level correspondences (Chen, 1993; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).","The statistical approach analyzes unstructured sentences in bilingual texts, and it is claimed that the results are useful enough in real applications such as machine translation and word sense disambiguation. However, structured bilingual sentences are undoubtedly more informative and important for future natural language researches. Structured bilingual or multilingual corpora serve as richer sonrces for extracting linguistic knowledge (Klavans and Tzonkermann, 1990; Sadler and Vendelmans, 1990; Kaji, Kida attd Morimoto, 1992; Utsuro, Matsnmoto and Nagao, 1992; Matsumoto, l.shimoto and Utsuro, 1993; Utsuro, Matsumoto and Nagao, 1993). Compared with the statistical approach, those works are quite different in that they use word correspondence information available in hand-written bilingual dictionaries and try to extract structured linguistic knowledge such as structured translation patterns and case frames of verbs. For example, in Matsunloto et al. (1993), we proposed a method for finding structural matching of parallel sentences, making use of word level similarities calculated from a bilingual dictionary and a thesaurus. Then, those structurally matched parallel sentences are used as a source for acquiring lexical knowledge snch as verbal case frames (Utsuro et al., 1992; Utsuro et al., 1993).","With the aim of acquiring those structnred linguistic knowledge, this paper describes a unilied framework for bilingual text matching by combining existing hand-written bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques. The process of bilingual text matchin 9 consists of two major steps: sentence alignment and structural matching of bilingual sentences. In those two steps, we use word correspondence information, which is available in hand-written bilingual dictionaries, or not included in bilingual dictionaries but estimated with statistical techniques.","The reasons why we take the approach of combining bilingual dictionaries and statistics are as follows: Statistical techniques are limited since 1) they require bilingnal texts to be long enough for extracting usefifl statistics, while we need to acquire structured liugnistic knowledge even from bilingual texts of about 100 sentences, 2) even with bilingual texts long enough for statistical techniques, useful statistics can not be extracted for low frequency words. For the reasons 1) and 2), the use of bilingual dictionaries is inevitable in our application. On the other hand, existing hand-written bilingual dictionaries are limited in that available dictionaries are only for daily wm'ds and usually domain specific on-line bilingual dictionaries are not available. Thus, statistical techniques are also inevitable for extracting domain specific word correspondence information uot included in existing bilingual dictionarie'~.","At present, we are at tile starting point of combining existing bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques. '['herefore, as statistical techniques tbr estimating word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries, we decided to adopt techniques a.s simple as possible, rather than techniques based-on complex probabilistic translation models such as in 1076 statistical = ="]},{"title":"UJaPanese ........ text ~ _e.st_im.{,t!,)_n o f English iext _J~l","paragraphs":["parso parse * Granlllll|r"]},{"title":"\"Dictionary ' 1 f ]","paragraphs":["penc!ency st rueture _j ( dependency"]},{"title":"structure J ~..,l~ Word Sinlilarity ( .... /~[~l ~\" ~ \" bilingual dictionary","paragraphs":["X.~matcllmg~../"]},{"title":"+","paragraphs":["thesaurus"]},{"title":"~./e@~llN,,,.~ -statistics [-.,,,p-,,c~e 1 .. \"Y'.\"P':'\"-..

In this paper, we call the pair of minimM corresponding segments in bilingual texts a sentence bead. 2 Then, sentences in bilingual texts of S and T are aligned into a sequence P of sentence beads: P = Pl,P~,...,Pk","We put some restriction on possibilities of sentence alignment. We assume that each sentence belongs to only one sentence bead and order constraints must be preserved in sentence alignment. Supposing Pi = (ai, xi; bi, Yi), those constraints are expressed in the following: a0 = 0 , b0 = 0 ai = ai 1 + .~ci , bi = bi-1 q- yl (1 < i _< k)","Suppose that a scoring function h can be defined for estimating the validity of each sentence bead pi. Then, bilingual sentence alignment problem can be defined as an optimization problem that finds a sequence P of sentence beads which optimizes the total score H of the sequence P: H(P) = IIh(h(pl) ..... h(pk))","3.2 Bilingual Sentence Alignment using Word Correspondence Information In this section, we describe the specification of our sentence alignment method based-on word correspondence information. 3","lIn this paper, we do not describe paragraph alignment process. For the moment, our paragraph alignment program is not reliable enough and the results of sentence alignment are better without paragraph alignment tban with paragraph alignment. Since bilingual texts in our bilingual corpus are not so long, the computational cost of sentence Mignment is not serious problem even without paragraph Mignment.","2The term bead is taken from Brown et al. (1991).","3We basically use dictionary-based bilingual sentence alignment method originMly reported in Murao (1991). The work in Murao (1991) was done under the supervision of Prof. M. Nagao and Prof. S. Sato (JAIST, East). 3.2.1 Score of Sentence Bead Before aligning sentences in bilingual texts, content words are extracted frmn each sentence (after each sentence is morphologicMly analyzed if necessary), and word correspondences are found using both bilingum dictionaries and statistical information source for word correspondence. Then, using those word correspondence information, the score h of a sentence bead p is calculated as follows.","First, supposing p= (a, x; b, y), and let n~(a, x) and nt(b,y) be the numbers of content words in the sequences of sentences s~4,... ,s, and"]},{"title":"t~v~,,...,tb","paragraphs":["respectively, and n~t(p) be the nunlber of corresponding word pairs in p.

Then, we solve the problem above by defining freq'(w,,w~), fveq'(w,), freq'(w't) , and N' which becmne the inputs to Gale's method or Kay's method. We describe two different ways of defining those vMues. Estimation I One is to estimate all the word correspondences equally except that the co-occurrence of wa and wt is preferred to that of ,w~ and w~. freq'(w~,w'~), fveq'(w~), freq'(w't) , and N' are given below: 4 fveq'(w,, ,w't) : freq(w,,"]},{"title":"w',) -- ~","paragraphs":["freq(w,,"]},{"title":"wt, w',)","paragraphs":["~t freq'(w,~) - freq(ws) freq'(w~t) - freq(w't)","N' -- N","(freq'(w,,wt) - freq(w,,wt) ) When w~, wt, and w~ are co-occurring in a sentence bead, the co-occurrence of w~ and wt is preferred and that of w~ and w I is ignored.
