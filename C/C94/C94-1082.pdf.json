'rite system uses a robust island-based parsing method controlled by user-defined performance thresholds. Keywords: I)CG, head, island parsing, robust parsing, Prolog 1 LHIP Overview This paper describes LIIII' (Left-Ilead corner Island Parser), a parser designed for broad-coverage handling of lmrestricted text. The system interprets an extended DCG formalism to produce a robust analyser that finds parses of the input made from 'islands' of terminals (corresponding to terminals consumed by successful grammar rules). It is currently in use for processing dialogue tr,'mscripts from the tICRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991), although we expect its eventual applications to he much wider. 1 Transcribed natural speech contains a number of frequent characteristic 'ungrmnmatical' phenomena: filled pauses, repetitions, restarts, etc. (as in e.g. Right I'll have ...you know, like I'll have to ...so I'm going between the picket fence and the mill, right.). ~ While a full analysis of a conversation might well take these into account, for many purposes they represent a significmlt obstacle to analysis. LIIIP provides a processing method wlfich allows selected portions of the input to be ignored or handled differently.","The chief modifications to the standard Prolog *grammar rule' format are of two types: one or more rlght-hand side (RtIS) items may be marked","*This work was carried out under grants nos. 20-33903.92 and 12-36505.92 from the Swiss National Fund.","tNote that the input consists of wr/tten texts within the Map Task Corpus; LtIIP is not intended for use in speech processing.","2This example is taken fronl the Map Task Corpus. as 'heads', and one or more RHS items may be marked as 'ignorable'. We expand on these points and introduce other differences below.","The behaviorlr of LHIP can best he understood in terms of the notions of island, span, cover and threshold:","Island: Within an input string consisting of the terminals (tl,t2,...tn), ~ island is a sub-sequence (ti, ti+l,.., ti+,,), whose length is m + 1.","Span: The span of a grammar rule R is the length of the longest island (tl,...tj) such that ternfinals tl and t i are both consumed (directly or indirectly) by R.","Cow.'r: A rule R is said to cover m items if rn terminals are consumed within the island described by R. The coverage of R is then rn.","Threshold: The threshold of a rule is the minimum ~;alue for the ratio of its coverage c to its span s which must hold in order for the rule to succeed. Note that c <_ s, aud that if c -- s the rule has completely covered the span, consuming all terminals. As implied here, rules need not cover all of the input in order to succeed. More specifically, the constraints applied in creating islands are such that ishmds do not have to be adjacent, but may be separated by non-covered input. Moreover, an island may itself contain input which is unaccounted for by the grammar. Islands do not overlap, although when multiple anMyses exist they will in general involve different segmentations of the input into islands.","There are two notions of non-coverage of the input: sanctioned and unsanetloned non-coverage. The latter case arises when the grammar simply does not account for some terminM. S~mctioned non-coverage means that some number of special 'ignore' rules have been applied which simulate coverage of input material lying between the ish'mds, thus in effect making the islands contiguous. Those parts of the input that have been 'ignored' are considered to have been 501 consmned. These ignore rules can be invoked ino dividually or as a class. It is this latter capability which distinguishes ignore rules from regular rules, as they are functionally equivalent other-wise, mainly serving as a notational aid for the grammar writer.","Strict adjacency between RHS clauses can be specified in the grammar. It is possible to define global and local thresholds for the proportion of the spanned input that must be covered by rules; in this way, the user of an LHIP grammar can exercise quite fine control over the required accuracy and completeness of the analysis.","A chart is kept of successes and failures of rules, both to improve efficiency and to provide a means of identifying unattached constituents. In addition, feedback is given to the grammar writer on the degree to which the grammar is able to cope with the given input; in a context of grammar development, this may serve as notification of areas to which the coverage of the grammar might next be extended.","The notion of ~head' employed here is connected more closely with processing control than linguistics. In particular, nothing requires that a head of a rule should share any information with the LItS item, although in practice it often will. Heads serve as anchor-points in the input string around which islands may be formed, and are accordingly treated before non-head items (RHS items are re-ordered during compilation-see below). In the central role of heads, LtIIP resembles parsers devised by Kay (1989) and van Noord (1991); in other respects, including the use which is made of heads, the approaches are rather different, however. 2 The LHIP System In this section we describe the LHIP system. First, we define what constitutes an acceptable LHIP grammar, second, we describe the process of converting such a grammar into Prolog code, and third, we describe the analysis of input with such a grammar.","LHIP graxnmars are an extended form of Prolog DCG graznmars. The extensions can be summarized as follows: a","1. one or more [tHS clauses may be nominated as heads;","ZA version of LHIP exists which permits a form of negation on RHS clauses.

Thus 'A ~ /3' indicates that A precedes I3 in the input, perhaps with some intervening material. The stronger constraint of immediate precedence is marked by ':'; 'A : B' indicates that the span of A precedes that of B, and that there is no 1recovered input between the two.

If used in a rule body, they indicate that input is potentially ignored-the problems that ignore rules are intended to repair will not always occur, in which case tile rules succeed without conslmfing any input. There is a semantic restriction on the body of a rule which is that it must contain at least one clause which necessarily covers input (optional clauses and ignore rules do not necessarily cover input).","The following is an example of a LtIIP rule.

First, the rule is read and the RHS clauses are partitioned into those marked as heads, and those not. A record is kept of their original ordering, and this record allows each clause to be constrMned with respect to the clause that precedes it, as well as with respect to the next head clause wMch follows it. Additional code is added to maintain a chart of known successes and failures of each rule. Each rule name is turned into the name of a Prolog clause, and addltionM arguments are added to it. These arguments are used for the input, the start and end points of the area of tlm input in which the rule may succeed, tile start and end points of the actual part of the input over which it in fact succeeds, the number of terminal items covered within that island, a reference to the point in the chart where the result is stored, and a list of pointers to sub-results. The converted form of tile above rule is given below (rMnus the code for chart maintenance):","s(conjunct(H,I,J), A, B, C, D, E, F,","ELIK]-K, G) :- lhip_threshold valuo(M), conjunction(H, A, B, C, O, P, Q,","R-S,_), s(l, A, B, fl, D, _, T, C-R, _). s(J, A.

In the current implementation of LI[IP, compiled rules are interpreted depth-first and left-to-right by the standard Prolog theorem-prover, giving an anMyser that proceeds in a top-down, qeft-head-corner' fashion. Because of the reordering carried out during compilation, the situation regard-ing left-recursion is slightly more subtle than in a conventional DCG. The 's(conjunct(... ))' rule shown above is a case in point. While at first sight it appears left-recursive, inspection of its converted form shows its true leftmost subrule 503 to be 'conjunction'. Naturally, compilation may induce left-recursion as well as eliminating it, in which case LIIIP will suffer from the same termination problems as an ordinary DCG formalism interpreted in this way. And as with an ordinary DCG formalism, it is possible to apply different parsing methods to LHIP in order to circumvent these problems (see e.g. Pereira and Shieber, 1987). A related issue concerns the in-terpretation of embedded Prolog code. Reorder-ing of lZHS clauses will result in code which precedes a head within a LtHP rule being evaluated after it; judicious freezing of goals and avoidance of unsafe cuts are therefore required.","LHIP provides a number of ways of applying a grammar to input. The simplest allows one to enumerate the possible analyses of the input with the grammar. The order in which the results are produced wiU reflect the lexical ordering of the rules as they are converted by LHIP. With the threshold level set to 0, all analyses possible with the grammar by deletion of input terminals can be generated. Thus, supposing a suitable grammar, for the sentence John saw Mary and Mark saw them there would be analyses corresponding to the sentence itself, as well as John saw Mary, John saw Mark, John saw them, Mary saw them, Mary and Mark saw them, etc.","By setting the threshold to 1, only those partial analyses that have no unaccounted for terminals within their spans can succeed. Hence, Mark saw them would receive a valid analysis, as would Mary and Mark saw them, provided that the grammar contains a rule for conjoined NPs; John saw them, on the other hand, would not. As this example illustrates, a partial analysis of this kind may not in fact correspond to a true sub-parse of the input (since Mary and Mark was not a conjoined subject in the original). Some care must therefore be taken in interpreting results.","A number of built-in predicates are provided which allow the user to constrain the behaviour of the parser in various ways, based on the notions of coverage, span and threshold:","lhip _phras o (+C, + S ) Succeeds if the input S can be parsed as an instance of category C.","lhip_ cv_phrase (+C, +S) As for lhip_phrase/2, except that all of the input must be covered.","lhip_phras e (+C, +S, -B, -E, -Coy) As for lhip_phrase/2, except that B binds to the beginning of the island described by this application of C, E binds to the position immediately following the end, and Coy binds to the ntunber of ternfinals covered.","lhip_mc_phrasos (+C, +S, -Coy, -Ps ) The maximal coverage of $ by C is Cov. Ps is the set of parses of S by C with coverage Coy.","lhip_rainmax_phr as e s (+C, +S, -Coy, -Ps ) As for lh±p_mc_phrases]4, except that Ps is additionally the set of parses with the least span.","lhip seq_phrase(+C,+S,-Seq) Succeeds if Soq is a sequence of one or more parses of S by C such that they are nonoverlapping and each consumes input that precedes that consumed by the next.","lhip maxT_phras os (+C, +S, -MaxT) MaxT is the set of parses of S by C that have the tfighest threshold value. On backtracking it returns the set with the next highest threshold value. In addition, other predicates can be used to search the chart for constituents that have been identified but have not been attached to the parse tree. These include:","lhip_success Lists successful rules, indicating island position and coverage.","lhip_ms_success As for lhip_success, but lists ouly the most specific successful rules (i.e. those which have themselves succeeded but whose results have not been used elsewhere).","lhip_ms_success (N) As for lhip_ms_succoss, but lists only successful instances of rule N. Even if a sentence receives no complete analysis, it is likely to contain some parsalfle substrings; results from these are recorded together with their position within the input. By using these predicates, partiM but possibly useful information can be extracted from a sentence despite a global failure to parse it (see section 4).","The conversion of the grammar into Prolog code means that the user of the system can easily develop anMysis tools that apply different constraints, using the tools provided as building blocks. 504 3 Using LHIP As previously mentioned, LHIP facilitates a cyclic approach to grammar development. Suppose one is writing an English grammar for the Map Task Corpus, and that the following is the first attempt at a rule for noun phrases (with appropriate rules for determiners and nouns): up(N,"]},{"title":"D, A) # 0.5 ,-~--~>","paragraphs":["determiner(D), * no,,n(N)","While tiffs rule will adequately anMyse simple NPs such as your map, or a missionary camp, on a NP such as the bottom right-hand corner it will give analyses for the bottom, the right-hand and the corner. Worse still, in a long sentence it will join determiners from the start of the sentence to nouns that occur in the latter hMf of the sentence. The number of superfluous anMyses can be reduced by imposing a local threshohl level, of say 0.5. By looking at the various analyses of sentences in the corpus, one can see that this rule gives the skeleton for noun phrases, but from the fraction of coverage of these parses one c,'m also see that it leaves out an importmlt feature, adjecfives, which are optionally found in noun phrases."]},{"title":"np(N, D, A)","paragraphs":["#"]},{"title":"0.5 ~,-~> determiner(D), (? adjectives(A) ?), * noun(N).","paragraphs":["With rids rule, one can now handle such phrases as the left-hand bottom corner, and a banana tree. Suppose further that this rule is now applied to tile corpus, and then the rule is applied again but with a local threshold level of 1. By looking at items parsed in the first case but not in the second, one can identify features of nolm phrases found in tlle corpus that are not covered by the current rules. Tiffs might include, for instance, phrases of the form a slightly dipping line. One can then go hark to the grammar azld see that the noun phrase rule needs to bc changed to account for certain types of modifier including adjectives and adverbial modifiers.","It is Mso possible to set loom thresholds dynamically, by making use of the '{ prolog code }' facility:"]},{"title":"np(N, D, A) # T ~,,~> determiner(D), (? adjectives(A) ?), * .o~.(N).","paragraphs":["{"]},{"title":"set_dynamic_threshold(A,T)","paragraphs":["}. In this way, the strictness of a rule may be varied according to information originating either within the particular run-time invocation of the rule, or elsewhere in the current parse. For example, it would be possible, by providing a suitable definition for set_dynamic_threshold/2, to set T to 0.5 when more titan one optional adjective has been found, and 0.9 otherwise.","Once a given rule or set of rules is stabl% and tile writer is satisfied with the performtmce of that part of the grammar, a local threshold value of 1 may bc assigned so that superfluous parses will not interfere with work elsewhere.","The use of the chart to store known results and failures allows the user to develop hybrid parsing techniques, rather than relying on the default depth-first top-down strategy given by analysing with respect to the top-most category. For instance, it is possible to anMyse the input in 'layers' of linguistic categories, perhaps start-ing by analysing noun-phrases, then prepositions, verbs, relative clauses, clauses, conjuncts, and finally complete sentences. Such a strategy allows the user to perform processing of results between these layers, w:hich can be useful in trying to find the 'best' analyses first. 4 Partial results The discussion of built-ln predicates mentioned facilities for recovering partial parses. Here we ilhlstrate this process, and indicate what further use might be made of tile information titus obtained.","In the following example, tile chart is inspected to reveal what constituents have been built during a t~iled parse of the truncated sentence Have you the tree by the brook that... :","> lhip_phrase(~(S), [have,you,the,tree,by,the,brook,that]). no > lhip success.

Recent proposals include the use of probabilistic methods (see e.g. Briseoe and Carroll, 1993) and large robust deterministic systems like Hindle's Fidditch (Hindle, 1989). 4 Experience so far suggests that systems like LIIIP may in the right circumstances provide an alternative to these approaches. It combines the advantages of Prolog-interpreted DCGs (ease of modification, parser output suitable for direct use by other programs, etc.) with the ability to relax tile adjacency constraints of that form&llsm in a flexible and dynamic manner.","LIHP is based on the assumption that partial results can be useful (often much more useful than no result at all), and that an approximation to complete coverage is more useful when it comes with indications of how approximate it is. This latter point is especially important in cases where a grammar must be usable to some degree at a relatively early stage in its development, as is, for example, the case with the development of a grammar for the Map Task Corpus. In the near future, we expect to apply LHIP to a different problem, that of defining a restricted language for specialized parsing.","The rationale for the distinction between sanctioned and unsanctioned non-coverage of input is twofold. First, the qgnore' facility permits different categories of unidentified input to be distinguished. For example, it may be interesting to separate material which occurs at the start of the input from that appearing elsewhere. Ignore rules have a similar flmctionality to that of normal rules. In particular, they can have arguments, and may therefore be used to assign a structure to unidentified input so that it may be flagged as such within an overall parse. Secondly, by setting a threshold value of 1, LtIIP can be made to perform llke a standaxdly interpreted Prolog DCG, though somewhat more efficiently","aIndeed, the ability of Fidditch to return a sequence of parsed but unattached phrases when a global analysis fails has clearly influenced the design of LHIP. 506 due to the use of the chart. ~","A number of possible extensions to the system can be envisaged. Whereas at present each rule is compiled individually, it would be preferable to enhance preprocessing in order to compute certain kinds of global information from the grammar. One improvement would be to determine possible linking of 'root-to-head' sequences of rules, and index these to terminal items for use as an oracle during anMysis. A second would be to identify those items whose early analysis would most strongly reduce the search space for subsequent processing and sc,'m the input to begin parsing at those points rather titan proceeding strictly front left to right. This further suggests the possibility of a parallel approach to parsing. We expect that these measltres would increase the efficiency of LHIP.","Currently, also, results are returned in an order determined by the order of rules in the grammar. It would be preferable to arrange matters in a more cooperative fashion so that the best (those with the highest coverage to span ratio) are displayed first. Support for bidirectional parsing (see Satta and Stock, to appear) is another candidate for inclusion in a later version. These appear to be longer-term research goals, however. 6 Acknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Louis des Tombe and Dominique Estival for comments on earlier versions of this paper.
