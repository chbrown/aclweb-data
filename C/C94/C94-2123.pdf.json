'iFhis knowledge may be expressed at different levels of abstraction depending on the phenomena involved: selecLional re~ strictions (SR~), lexical preferences, eel-locations, etc. We are specially interested on SIhs, which can be ex-. pressed as semantic type constraints t/tat a word se~se imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation. SRs nmst iachlcle information on the syntactic position of the words thai; are being restricted semantically.

If it was possible to represent roughly the Sits of the word being studied, it could be possible to clmssify roughly the concordances automatically in the different word uses before the lexicographer analysis.","The possible sources of Sits are: introspection by lexicographers, machine-readable dictionaries, ~nd on-- line corpora. 'l'he main advantage of the latter is that they provide experimental evidence of words uses. tl.e-- cently, several approaches on acquiring different kinds of lexical information from corpora have been developed [BPV92, CG[III91, CH90, Res92]. This paper is interested in exploring the amenability of using a method f(~r extracting SI{~ from textual data, in the line of these works. The aim of the proposed technique is to learn the Sl~,s that a word is imposing, from the analysis of the examples of use of that word contaim'd in the corpus. An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure l, where the system, depart-ing from the three examples of use, and knowing that prosec'utor, buyer attd lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class <pera-m~, individual >, and that i~zdictme~d, assura~zce and legislation are members of < legal_in.strttmeuZ >, should induce that the verb see/.' imposes SILs that constraint the subject to be a nmm-. bet of the semantic type <peraon, individval>, and the object to be a kind of < legaLiustrurnent >. Coneluding, the system should extract for each word (with contplemeut,..~) having enough number occurrences of use in the corpus and for each of its syntactic eomplemelttS, a li:;t of the alternative Sl~s that this word is imposing.","In order to detect the SRs that a word imposes in il;s coutext hy means of statistical techniques two distiuct approaches haw~, been proposed: word-based [CC, HIIgl], and class..based"]},{"title":"[Bpv92, ~tes92].","paragraphs":["Word-. based al~proach infers SRs as the collection of words that co-occur significantly in the syntactic context of the studi,'.d word.

SRa are only acquired if there are enough cases in the corpus as to gather statistical evidence. As long as distinct uses of the same verb can have different SRs, we permit to extract more than one class for the same syntactic position. Nevertheless, they must be umtually disjoint, i.e. not related by hyperonymy.","Previous knowledge used In the process of learning SRs, the system needs to know how words are clustered in semantic classes, and how semantic classes are hierarchically organized. Ambiguous words must be represented ms having different hyperonym classes. In subsection 2.2 we defend the use of a b'road-coverage taxonomy.","Learning process The computational process is di-vided in three stages: (1) Guessing the possible semantic classes, i.e. creation of the space of can-didates. In principle, all the hyperonyms (at all levels) of the nouns appearing in the training set are candidates. (2) Evaluation of the appropriate~ hess of the candidates. In order to compare the different candidates, art statistical measure summa.rizing the relevance of the occurrence of each of the candidate classes is used. (3) Selection of the most appropriate subset of the candidate space to convey the SILs, taking into account that the final classes must be mutually disjoint. While in subsection 2.3 an statistical measure to flflfill stage 2 is presented, stages 1 and 3 are discussed in 2.4 thoroughly. 2.1 Extracting Co-occurrence Triples In any process of learning from examples the accuracy of the training set is the base for the system to make correct predictions. In our case, where the semantic classes are hypothesized not univoquely from the ex~ staples, accuracy becomes fundamental.","Different approaches to obtain lexical co-occurrences have been proposed in the literature [BPV92, CGHH91, CH90]. These approaches seem inappropriate for tackling our needs, either because they detect only local co-occurrences[CGHtI9i, CtI90], or because they extract many spurious co-occurrence triples [BPV92, Clt90]. On the one hand, our system in-tends to learn SRs on any kind of verb's complements. On the other hand, the fact that these approaches extract co-occurrences without reliability on being verb-complements violates accuracy requirements. However, if the co-occurrences were extracted from a corpus annotated with structural syntactic information (i.e., part of speech and \"skeletal\" trees), the results would have considerably higher degrees of accu-770 racy and representativity. In this way, it would be easy to detect all tile relationships between verb and con> plements, and few non-related co-occurrences would be extracted. 'rile most serions objection to this approach is that the task of producing syntactic analyzed corpora is very expensive. Nevertheless, lately there has been a growing interest to produce skeletally analyzed corpora 1","A parser, with some simple heuristics, wonI(1 be enough to meet the requirements of representativeness and accuracy introduced above• On the other band, it could be useful to represent the co-occurrence triples as holding between lemmas, in order to gather ~ much evidence as possible. A simple morphological analyzer that could get the lemma for a big percentage of tile words appearing in the corpus would suffice. 2.2 Semantic Knowledge Used Of the two class-based approaches presented in section 1, [Res92]'s technique uses a wide-coverage semantic taxonomy , whereas [BPV92] consists in hand-tagging with a fixed set of semantic labels . The advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are diverse. On the one hand, in [BPV92] approach, semantic classea relevant to the domain are chosen, and consequently, the adjustment of the classes to the corpus is quite nice. Nevertheless, [I'~es92]'s system is less constr~ined and is able to induce a most appropriate level for the SRs. On the other hand, while [BPV92] implies hand-coding all the relevant words with semantic tags, [[{.es92] needs a broad semantic taxonomy. IIowever, there is already an available taxonomy, WordNet 2. We take ires92] approach because of the better results obtained, and the lower cost involved.","2.3 Class appropriateness: the Association Score When trying to choose a measure of the appropriate-. hess of a semantic class, we have to consider the features of the problem: (1) robustness in front of noise, and (2) conservatism in order to be able to generalize only front positive examples, without having the tendency to over-generalize.","Several statistical measures that accomplish these requirements have been proposed in the literature [BPV92, CGIItI91, l{es92].

He performed a best-first search on the candidate space. Itowever, if tile function to maximize doesn't have a monotone behavior (as it is the c~e of Assoc) the best-first search doesn't guarantee global optimals, but only local ones. This fact made us to decide for a global search, specially because the candidate space is not so big. 3 EXPERIMENTAL I{ESU LTS In order to experiment the methodology presented, we implemented a system in a Unix machine. The corpus used for extracting co-occurrence triples is a fragment of parsed material from the Penn Treebank Corpus (about 880,000 words and 35,000 sentences), consisting of articles of the Wall Street Journal, that has been tagged and parsed. We used Wordnet ~ the verb and noun lexicons for the lemmatizer, and also as the semantic taxonomy for clustering nouns in semantic classes. In this section we evaluate the performance of the methodology implemented: (1) looking at the performance of the techniques used for extracting triples, (2) considering the coverage of the WordNet taxonomy regarding the noun senses appearing in Treebank, and (3) analyzing the performance of the learning process.","Tile total number of co-occurrence triples extracted amounts to 190,766. Many of these triples (68,800, 36.1%) were discarded before tile lemmatizing pro~ tess because the surface NP head wasn't a noun. The remaining 121,966 triples were processed through the lemmatizer. 113,583 (93.1%) could be correctly mapped into their corresponding lemma [\\)rm.","in addition, we analyzed manually the results obtained for a subset of tile extracted triples, looking at the sentences in the corpus where they occurred. The subset contains 2,658 examples of four average common verbs in the Treebank: rise, report, seek and present (from now on, tile testing sample). On the one hand, 235 (8.8%) of these triples were considered to be extracted erroneously because of the parser, and 51 (1.9%) because of the lemmatizer. Summarizing, 2,372 (89.2%) of the triples in the testing set were considered to be correctly extracted and lemmatized.","When analyzing the coverage of WordNet taxonomy a we considered two different ratios. On the one hand, how many of the noun occurrences have one or more senses included in the taxonomy: 113,583 of the 117,215 extracted triples (96.9%). On the other hand, how many of the noun occurrences in the testing sample have the correct sense introduced in the taxonomy: 2,615 of the 2372 well-extracted triples (8.7%). These figures give a positive evaluation of the coverage of WordNet.","In order to evaluate the performance of the learning process we inspected manually the SRs acquired on the testing-sample, a.ssessing if they corresponded to the actual Sits imposed. A first way of evaluation is by means of meazuring precision and recall ratios in the testing sample. In our e~e, we define precision as the proportion of triples appearing in syntactic positions with acquired SRs, which effectively fififill one of those SRs. Precision amounts to 79.2%. The remaining 20.8% triples didn't belong to any of the classes induced for their syntactic positions. Some of them because they didn't have the correct sense included in the WordNet taxonomy, and others because tile correct class had not been induced because there wasn't","3The information of proper nouns in WordNet is poor.
