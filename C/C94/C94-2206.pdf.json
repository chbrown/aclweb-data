A lexical transducer, lirst described by Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaencn (KKZ) (Karttunen, 1992a), is a speeialized tinite state transducer (FST) that maps canonical citation forms of words and morphological categories to infh.'cted surface forms, and vice versa. l;]'s have many advantages for stemming, morphological analysis, and generation. They are","(i) bldirectlonah the same structure (:an be used for stemming and generation.","(ii) etticient: the recognition and generation of word tbrms does not require the application of any morphological rules at runtime. LTs for li',nglish and French have been built at Xerox PARC within a t}amework known as two-level Inorphology (Koskenniemi, 1983). As described by KKZ(Karttuneu, 1992a), this can be done in three steps: (i) we construct a simple flnite-state automa ton (LA) that defines all valid lexical tbrms (LFs) of the language.. A I,F is a eoncateuation of stems and morphemes in their canonical dictionary representation. (ii) We describe morphological alternations by means of two-lew,.1 rules(Koskeuniemi, 1983; Kin't-","1 '['his p~per was partially supporl;ed by t(orcan Science and h]nginecring l,'onndation. tunen, 1993), compile the rules to finite-state transducers, and intersect them to form a single rule transducer (RSF). (iii) We merge the LA with the ffF by composition producing the 1/[' that has on its lexical side every valid lexical form of the language and on the surface side the corresponding realization as determined by the morphological alternations of the language.","KKZ argued that for l!'rench, it, was best to divide step (ii) into two stages. A three-level description was required to give a linguistically satisfactory account of the plural lbrmation of eompomld nouns. KKZ opted for two cascading two-level rule systems thai; are cornpiled separately, then intersected laterally and finally composed to a single RT.","The task of building a morphological analyzer for ~t language such as Korean or ,I apanese is a much higher challenge than it is for l';uglish and French. A Kore.an verb may have more than fifty thousand inflected forms. = The Korean writing system (l]anaul) does not consistently distinguish be.tween single and eompound nouns. Because llangul uses syllabic characters, changes in syllable strucl, ure are directly reflected in the. orthography.","Because o[' the complexity of the morphological alternations in Korean, it; is very difficult, although not impossible in principle, to describe them in a single two-level rule system or in a system that is limited to just three levels like the KKZ system for French. The most natural description of the Korean alternation is a cascade of rules of greater depth."]},{"title":"2 Morphological Alternations in Korean","paragraphs":["3'he [langul is a phonemic syllabic-based script where morphologieal alternations that change the syllable strllctnre of the word are rellected in the orthography (Korean Ministry of Education, 1988; Kim, 1990).

The first step was to divide the total list of morphemes into snblexicons on the basis of their morphological type and to make a text file for each sublexieon. We added diacritic markers to the edges of certain types of morphemes in order to be able to enforce morphotactie constraints on valid morpheme sequences.","Each sublexicon was compiled separately to a finite-state automaton. The sublexicons were used to con struct the LA with the help of the regular expression facility in the ifsm-toolkit..For example, having compiled a simple automaton from the list ofsm@le nouns, we could expand it to an infinite lexicon of compound nouns with the regular expression \"noun.auto\" [# \"noun.auto\"l*","']'his regular expression reads the noun automaton from a file and concatenates it with itself any number of times and marks the internal word boundaries with #.","The first version of the LA was made in this way by combining sublexicons with regular operations (concatenation, union, iteration).","In order to enforce morphotactic constraints on the concatenation of some classes of snflixes, we wrote a set of two-level rules that require or prohibit the occurfence of particular diacritics at certain suffix boundaries. Lexieal forms that do not satisfy the morphotactic constraints get eliminated in the composition with the well-formedness rules. The diacritics them-selves are realized as zero so that they are not present in the lower side of the resulting transducer. The final form of the lexical automaton is obtained by extract-ing the lower-side from that transducer as a simple automaton.","We believe that this incremental method of lexicon construction is better suited to morphologically complex languages than the lexicon format commonly used in two-level morphology. In standard two-level lexicons, individual entries contain intbrmation about which sublexicon they may concatenate with. The entire lexical structure is compiled in one step to large letter tree (Karttunen, 1993; Antworth, 1990). Our method is more tractable in two ways. Firstly, the lexicon can be developed and refined stepwise. Secondly, the morphotactic rules of the language are described explicitly as the regular expressions that construct the LA in conjunction with the well-formedness constraints that eliminate certain types of concatenations. In two-level lexicons of the standard variety, the morphotactic structure of the language is not described explicitly at; all. l~,ather, it is expressed in a very opaque and indirect way, in the sequences of links between entries and snblexicons.","Sproat argued thai; two-level morphology of morphotactics leads to a somewhat inelegant model of long-distance dependencies and suggested the unficalion scheme, due to Bear, as a solution (Sproat, 1992). But unification scheme introduces additional runtime overhead. The above approach can easily and explicitly describe the fact that \"-able\" attaches to verbs formed with the prefix \"en-\" and does not require additional runtime overhead.","We give a few examples of the difficulties in the description of Korean morphol;artics. There are two different types of endings: (i) non-tinM (verbal) endings for tense, modality, subject honorific or aspect, and (it) final (verbal) endings as cornplementizer, nominalizer and adjectivizer. The non-tinal endings are placed in fl'ont of final endings and must be followed by a suflix of the second type.","(4) shows the ordering restrictions of non-finM endings. The parentheses indicate optionality.","(4.) (+ lion) (4- t'~st 4- Perf (4- Will) I(+ Past ) (+ Will) (4- Beta'o)) (Hon:Honorific; ]~etro:I{ei~rospection ; Perf: Perfect Aspect)","(4) compiles to a lexicon covering 20 difi>rent compound non-final ending sequenees including null. 'l'his representation is clearly more informative than a simple listing of the members of the class. The proMbition of \"Past+Perf+Will+l{.etro\" in (4) can not be described by an adjacency table.","In (4) we do not need any morphotactic diacritics on the left, because all non-final endings can combine with any verb and adjective stems arm the combination of non-final and final endings is controlled by the diacritics of the latter group.","(5) shows three entries in the suhlexiron of final endings. Tim elements in square brackets are morpho tactic diacritics. (Square brackets indicate grouping, the vertical bar marks a disjunction.) 'Phe diacritics are deleted by well-formedness rules when the final endings are combined with other morphemes. The diacritics on the left of nun and nuu-ka shows that they can not combine with adjectives."]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["[Verb I Adj I I{on I P;~t I WlU I I'~.~'f] ~ ~ {l)~) ; [Verb [ Ilon] 4 ....... {Con) ; [V~,b I rtoH I ru~t I win] + ....... k.

Consequently, it is possible to combine sets of parallel two-level rules by intersection and merge them with the lexicon and other rule systems in a cascade, of compositions. The complexities of Korean morphology make it desirable both tbr linguistic and computational reasons to allow for many more intermediate levels than assumed in previous works on English and t,~reneh, l{.e-gardless of the nnmber of intervening levels, the outcome is a single lexieal transduce.r thaw directly maps lexical forms to their intlected surface realizations, and vice versa.","In the construction of the lexieal automaton for Ko-. rean, we have put two-level rules to a novel use as well-formedness constraints on lexical tbrms. The sublexicons from which the LA is constructed contain (tiacritic marks on the outer edge that identify the type of morphoh)gical constituents that the lexicon contains. The role of rules in the [,A constructions is to enforce morphotaetics and, at the same time, to eliminate the diacritics that encode them.","Theoretically, we can get the same LT to compose the morphotactic and phonological >ties all together into one. rule and compose it with the initial LA or to compose the initial LA with each rule of the mor photaetic and phonological rules one by one in order. Practically, the composition of all the morphotactic and phonologieal rules into one rule causes the combinatorial explosion of states. This shows that ordered rules can be used to avoid the combinatorial explosion of states in one two level rule system too.
