The most eon-nnon types are taken nnder closer scrutiny. It has to be decided whetlier these are genuine word forms or non-words (e.g. misspellings). At the begimfing, I used several (I;tys to update the lexical module for a new batch of text but experience and increased coverage of the lexicon haw~ diminished the time needed tbr this task considerably. [ have added words above a certain frequency routinely to the ENG'I'WOL lexicon. The fi'equency is no~ fixed but de~ermined by practical considerations. For instance, when the data contain a great, deal of duplication (as in l, he BBC material owing to the repetitive nature of daily broadcasting), simple token fl.equency is a poor indicator of what is a suigable item to add to the lexicon. IIowever, sarnpiing methods have not heen developed t.o optimise the size of the lexicon, beea/ise it is not crucial for the present purpose. My lexieal practices differ sornewhat fi.om the updating procedure doeurnented in [V'outilain,'n, 1994]. If our aim is to SUpl)ly every word in running text; with all prol)er rnorphological and syntactic readings, we c,'Lnllot deprive frequent IlOllstandard words (e.g. htrn, veggie, wanna) of their obvious morphological readings because this might cause the whole sentence to be misanalysed. Siuce prescriptive considerations were not taken into aeeotmt in the design of ENGTWOI,, many el~t.rles marked as informal' or lang' in conventional dictionaries were added to the lexicon. I have also included highly domain-specific entries into the lexicon if they were frequent enough in certain types of data, especially when heuristics might produce erroneous or incomplete analyses for the word in question (e.g. species of fish which have the saule form in singular and plural: brill, chub, ¢laTfish) t . ()he advantage of iucluding all frequetfl, gralfldeal words tO the lexicon is that EN(TFWOL filterlnl2; of incornitlg texts produces output which can he more reliably dealt with by autoulatic nleaus. \\Vh,m :111 frequent nonstandard and even foreign words are listed in the lexicon, the otttput can be used in a straightforward way for generating new entries. The procedure of adding new entries to the lexicon goes its follows: first, all words are classified aec¢~rding to the part-of-speech they belong to. Second, new entries in the ENGTWOL format are generat.ed automatically from these word-lists using readymade tools presented in [Voul.ihfiuen, 1994]. Lists or new entries are carefully checked up, and additiolml feat.ures (such as transiLivity and complemenl;ation","IThe default category of morphological heuristics is :t singular Iioun. ht the case of a potential plural form (sending), au underspecified tag S(I/PL is given.

Ilut when the usage a.nd distribution seems to be /lllelea.r, [ have generated an on-line concordance directly from the corpus..qlnee I have dealt with words which have a frequency of, say, at, least 10 tokens in the corpus, tJfis method seems to be quite reliable. We cannot detect errors ill the lexicon during the initial liltering phase. ()nee a certain string has had one or more entries in the lexicon, it is not present in the output of the filtering, and other potential uses might not. be added to the lexicon ~. And fi'eqllent errors telld to get., corrected since all incorrect analyses detected during the manual iuspee(.ion a.re corrected directly it, the lexicon.
