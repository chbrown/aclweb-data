Further substitution relations such as metaphoric","repetition (7d), negated az~tonyray (7e), etc. can","be added:","(7) d. while Daniela wafted away to Norway.","e. Daniela also did not stay at home.","Collocation stands for 'any recognizable lezicosemastic relation' between lexicM expressions in related discourse segments. Examples of collocation relations are attribution (7f), partition (7g), means (7h), etc.:","(7) f. it was a very pleasant journey. g. making a stop over in Munich. It. it was one of those ~ifl aircrafts.","As our examples show, reiteration and collocation relations help to ensure not only cohesion, but also coherence in texts. Therefore, a text generator has to provide an organization of lexical resources that tailors discourse structure relations to reiteration and collocation relations. This presupposes, on the one hand, a precise picture of which reiteration and collocation relations are available in language and how they are realizable; and, on the other hand, a fine-grained discourse model that contains these relations. To make allowance for the global discourse organization, which is performed independently from lexical resources, we suggest a two level text planning task implementation, with the first level realized by a Rhetorical Struclure 7'heory (its'r) (M ann and Thompson, 1987) style text planner and the second level -- by a separate lexical choice module. Then, the discourse organization of a text is done in two steps: in the first step, the text planner predetermines the discourse structure relations; in the second step, the lexical choice module provides, in accordance with linguistic constraints, the final determination and the realization of these discourse structure relations.","The present paper reports an attempt to define lexieally biased discourse structure relations used in a partially implemented lexical choice module. I)ue to the lack of space, we do not discuss the module it-self; it is described in detail in (Wanner, 1992, 1994). Here, we demonstrate how discourse organization for text generation can be refined by lexically biased discourse structure relations and how these relations are related to global discourse relations specified in the output of an RST style text planner.","In contrast to the most discourse models (cf., e.g., McKeown, 1985; Ch'osz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and Thompson, 1987), which take the clause ~ts the minimal discourse segment, we consider as discourse segments \"perspectives\" (cf. McCoy, 1989)- specific views taken on a semantic entity (an object, an ew~'nt, etc.). A perspective is a wording which is tailored to the lexical repertoire of an entity; it is realizable as a clause, a phrase, or as a single lexeme. Each of the clauses in the examples above can be considered as a realization of a single perspective; ~md the reiteration and collocation relations that hold between the clauses","as well-defined perspective pairs.","In our model, a single perspective is represented as a composition of Mel'&fl~'s Lexical l,~unctions (hereafter LFs) (Mel'&fl{ and Polgu~re, 11987); perspective pairs are represented as LI~' sequences. The lbllowing distinctive features characterize our model:","• it makes snre that all relations defined ~tre expressible in language,","• it allows for a realization of lexicM relations as subclansal relations between discourse segments,","• it is sensitive to lexical and syntactic wtriations ['or the realization of discourse structure relations. 2 LEXICAL FUNCTIONS IN DIS-COURSE 2.1 The Basics Formally speaking, an L~ f is a standard semantico-lexical relation which holds between a lexeme 1,1 (the keyword of f ) and a set of lexemes f(t,) (the wdue of f).

(2aul is entirehj occupied by the I~o-marts; well, not enti~vly ...one small village still hohls out.","b. Gaul is uhnost entirehj oecvpied by the l?omans; but one small village still hohls out. In this case, tim taxonomy of lexical discourse structure relations is entered at a relatively general level (in the worst case at TOP). (iii) An lIST relation is not captured by our taxonomy (as, e.g., CONCI,ISSION). Then, the corresponding ease fi'ames are treated as unrelated (see above). 5 RELATED WORK Our proposal for tile description of lexically biased discourse structure relations resembles l)anlos' work (Danlos, 1987), who presented acceptable ehmse pattern sequences explMtly in a Discourse Grammar. The. basic difference between Danlos' work and ours is that in the Discourse (h'amrnar, clause pattern seqtlences are represented as concreLe valency sehelllatlt while in our model they are represented as functional distinctions that encode sequcndes o[' I,FS. As a result, we do I/el. ['aee the probhml of being restricted to a concrete small domahl as l)anlos does.","Metoer's text phumer (Meteer, 1992) is another prol)osa.l for the realization of lexically biased discourse strucl.ure relations. [/ut while we argue that lexically biased (liscourse structure relal;ions are to I)e realized by a functionally motiwd,ed h'.xical choice. model, Meteer sugggests a single struetundly moti rated model For text planning, which also sul)sumes lexical choice. This is different from, e.g., (R.ubineff, 1992), who ensures the expressil)ility o1\" discourse structure relations provide(l I)y a conventional text l)hmner by annotating linguistic structures.","Elhadad's prol)osal (Elhadad, 1992)to use 7bpoi (inference ,'ules that encode relations between t)ropo - sitk)ns incorporating lexical material) as discourse structure relations is aimed at exploiting lexical phenomena for discourse organization. Elhadad focuses, however, on the 'argumentative potential' of lexieal items r;~t.her t.llan on lexica.lly biased discourse structure relations. 374"]},{"title":"6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK","paragraphs":["In this paper, we argue<l that it, is useful Lo distinguish between two levels of discourse organization: a global discourse organization, which is not afli~cted by linguistic means; and a finer discourse orgauizal,iou, which is built tip in accordance with the linguistic material that is availal>le for the meaning communicated.","We have shown that reiteration aud collocatiott relations may function as discourse stru<:ture relatious and that these relations are well represented by Lez'- ical Function sequences.
