'Poday, several part-of-speech tagged corpora are readily available for research use. [Iowever, because there is wide diversity of morphological information systems (word-segmentation~ part-of-speech system, etc.), it is ditficult to use tagged corpora with an incompatible morphological infm'mation system.

Linguistic corpora can be classified as word-segmented corpora, part-of-speech tagged corpora, and parsed corpora, tlecause a part-of-speech tagged corpus is the most important corpus, much corpus-based natural language processing research has been performed using part-of-speech tagged corpora.","Ilowever, building a large part-of-speech tagged corpus is very dillicult. It is even more difficult to build a corpus for languages without explicit word boundary characters, such as Japanese. q'herefore, researchers always complain of the scarcity of data in the corpus.","To solve this data scarcity problem, previous works proposed methods of increasing the productivity of the labor required for building a part-of-speech tagged corpus. [1].","'.l'his paper proposes another method of acquir-ing large part-of-speech tagged corpora: restructuring tagged corpora by using morpheme adjustment rules. This method assures good use of the sharable part-of-speech tagged corpora that are already awdlable such as the ATR Dialog Database (ADD) [2;"]},{"title":"3].","paragraphs":["Ideally, these corpora could be used by all re-","searchers and research groups without any modifica-","tions, llowever, actual part-of-speech tagged corpora","have the following problems:","• Diversity of orthography: A word can be spelled in various ways. In Japanese, there are three types of character sets: kanji (i~.~\"-), hiragana (~ to ~ ~), and katakana (:~J # :~J ¢). Also, people can use these character sets at their discretion.","• Diversity of word segmentation: Because the Japanese language has no word boundary characters(i.e, blank spaces), there","are no standards of word segmentation. A sin-","gle word in a certain corpus may be considered","nmltiple words in other corpora, and vice versa.","• Diw;rsity of part-of speech systems:","There are no standards for part-of-speech sys-","tems.

This problem","is language-independent.","Diversities of word-segmentation and part-of-speech systems are fatal problems. The simplest way to solve these problems is to perform a morphological analysis on the raw text in the corpus, with no regard to the word-segmentation and part-of-speech infer mation. Uowever, making a high-quality morphological analyzer demands much time and care. Additionally, it is wasteful to ignore the word-segmentation and part-of-speech i,fformation that h~s been acquired with much effort.","In restructuring tagged corpora with nmrpheme adjustmel,t rules, tim word-segrnentation and part-of-speech inlbrmation of the original corpus is rewrittm,, making good use of the original corpus information. \"riffs method is characterized by reduced manual effort.","In the next section, the method of rest, rueturing tagged corpora is described in detail.

Table 2 shows the result.","The error rates seem to be rather large, but it should be noted that only simple knowledge sources are used both ill our method (the morpheme adjuster) and by the morphological analyzer. Also, it is significant that our targets are spoken-style Japanese sentences. Ordinary morphological analyzers can analyze written-style Japanese sentences with a less than 50_/o error rate, by using richer knowledge sources[I]. However, previous work reported that the error rate for automatic morphological analysis of the ADD text is more than 15%[6].","hi comparing the two methods, the part-of-speech error rates of our method are clearly better than those of the morphological analyzer.

The eventuaI goal of this work is to make precious knowledge sources truly sharable among many researchers.

Brill's simple part-of-speech tagger call be considered a morpheme adjnster that adjusts differences between initial (default) tags and correct ta~s.","As Brill applied his part-of-speech tagging technique to tbe syntactic bracketing technique[8], we believe that our method can be applied to the adjustment of parsed corpora. In the work of Grishman et al.[9], tree rewriting rules to adjust differences between Tree Bank and their grammar were probably prepared manually. By applying our method to parsed corpora, such rewriting rules call be extracted automatically."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The attthors would llke t.o thank Dr. Yasnhlro Yamazaki, President of ATI/ interpreting Telecommunications Lalmrat.orles, for his collstant supl)ot't and encouragement.."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Maruyama, ll., Oglno, S., l[idano, M., \"The Mega-Word Tagged-Corpus Project,\" TMI-93, pp.15-23, 1990","[2] Ehara, T., Ogtlra, a. and Morimoto, T, \"ATR, Dialogue Database,\" ICSLP-90, pp.1093-1096, 1990.","[3] Sagisaka, Y., Uratani, N., \"ATI~ Spoken Language Datahase,\" The Journal ,ff Ihe Acoustical Society of Japan, Vol. ,18, 12, l)p. ggs-S82, 1992.
