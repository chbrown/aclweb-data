In particular, I address the problem of providing an adequate formalisation of categorial commctives l)ro-l)osed by Moortgat (1988), which are useful for handling certain forms of diseontimmus eonstitnency, l)e-spite some interesting proposals, a satisfactory logic for these e{mnectives has so far remained dnsive. I will provide such a h)gie, using an approach that falls within the general framework of labelled deductive systems (Gabbay, 1991), employing novel methods for reasoning ahout linear order in resource nsage. The approach is illusl;rated by linguistic al}plications for extraction, pied-piping and quanti[ieation. The Lambek calctflus Our general fran,ework is the associative I,ambelc calculus (L: l,mnbek, 1958), a system which falls within the class of formalisms known as Categorial Grammars. The set of types is freely generated firom a set of primitiw; (atomic) types (e.g. {s, np .... }), using binary infix el)craters \\, /, .. The 'meaning' of these connectives in L is fixed hy a senlanties for the logic, based on a (se,nigroup)algehra of strings (Z:,.), i.e. where • is an associative, notl-coulmtltative binary operator, with two-sided identity e, and E is the set Of non-eHlpty (-7 t:- g) strings over some vocabulary.

Alternative formulations carry different advantages, e.g. natural dcductlon is well suil.cd for lh,guisl.ic prcsental.ion, whereas proof nets haw~ benefits for automated theorem proving. l)iscontinuous type constructors The I,ambek calculus is a purely concatenative system: where any two types are combined, the string of the result is arrived at by concatenating the strings of the types combined. This point is illustrated graphically in (la,b), for the Lambek tractors, where (following Moortgat, 1991) each triangle represents a result string, and unshaded and shaded areas represent fnnetor and argutlre.nt stril/gs, respectively."]},{"title":"(1) (a) X/Y (b) YXX (c) XIY (d)","paragraphs":["XIY","Y Y Y y l'rclixa~ion Suffixal.ion Extraction Infixation","Various linguistic phenomena, however, suggest the existence of discontinous constituency, i.e. situations the result string from combining two constituents is not produced by concatenating the component strings. (See e.g. Bitch, 1981.) Moortgat (1988) suggests augmen£ing ]T, with two discontinuous type construct, ors. An exh'aclion fimctor X]Y is one whose argument corresponds to a non-peripheral (or more precisely, nor necessaribj peripheral) suhstring of the result of con> binaries, as it, (lc). An infixation fimetor XIY itself corresponds to a non-l)eril)heral substring of the result of combination, as in (ld). Given these intuitiw'~ characterisations, two options arise for the meaning of each comlecLive as to whether the point of insertion of one striug into the other is free (universal) for lixed (existential). In this paper, I will focus on the existential variants of the commctives, which appear to he the most linguistically useful, and whose interpretive conditions arc as follows: Previous proposals F, ach connective should have two inference rules: a rule of proof (showing how to derive a type containing the connective), and it rule of nse (showing how to employ such a type). This indicates a possible eight inference rules that we might hope to state (i.e. proof/use"]},{"title":"x universal/existential x infixation/extraction). V~ri~","paragraphs":["ous attempts have I~eeu made to provide a logic for tile discoutiuuous type constructors, but all have proved ullsu('cessflll or unsatisI'actory in some way or another. 1235","Moortgat (1988), for example, uses an ordered sequent calculus framework, which allows only two of the possible eight rules to be stated: a rule of proof for existential T, and a rule of nse for universal ~. Moortgat (1.991) nses a proof method in which types are not ordered in proof representations, where linear order constraints and consequences are instead handled using a system of string labelling, i.e. types are associated with string terms, which are explicitly manipulated by inference rules. This approach allows two further rules to be stated, but the four expressible rules are distribnted one per connective, i.e. a complete logic is not given for even any one connective. As Versmissen (1991) notes, Moortgat's string label system does not allow the recording of a specific position for inserting one string into another, as would seem to be required.","Morrill & Solias (1993) avoid this latter problem by augmenting the string ]al~elling algebra with a nonassocia(,ive pairing operator (., .), allowing labels such as {st, s2), indicating an insertion point in between sl and s2. 'lPhis system allows versions of T and ~ operators to be specified, hut ones whose interpretive definitions differ from Moortgat's. The non-associativity of pairing gives rise to limited flexibility for the system in terms of the type combinations that can be derived, and even the types that can be constructed, e.g. no flmctor (X~Y)/Z, where a ] argument is not the first sought, is allowed. Labelled deduction &: Lambek calculus I next develop a formulation of L which can be e×- tended to allow for the (existential) discontinuity connectives. Our starting point is a lambda term semantics for implicational L due to Bnszkowski (1987), ba.sed on the well kuown Cnrry-Howard interpretal;ion of proofs (Iloward, 1969)3 This uses a bidirectional variant of the lambda calculus whose basic terms are directionally typed variables. If t is a term of type Y\\X (resp. X/Y), and u one of type Y, then (at) t (resp. (tu)\") is a term of type X. If v is a variable of type Y, and t a term of type X, then klv.t (resp. 2\"v.t) is a term of type Y\\X (resp. X/Y). A semantics for implicational L is given by the class of terms which","2Under the Curry-lloward interpretation (lloward, 1969), logical formulas are regarded as types of expressions in typed lalnbda calculus, with atomic formulas corresponding to basic types, and a formula A--~B to the type of functions from A to tl. It is dmnonstrable that the set of formulas for which there exists stone correspondingly typed lambda term is precisely the theorems of the impfieatlonal fragment of intuitlonistlc logic. Thus, typed lambda calculus provides a s emantlcs for implicational in-tuitlonlstic logic, i.e. an independent, characterlsation of 'valid deductlon',just as the algebralc semantics of L provides an independent characterisatlon of validity for that system. Semantics for vm'ious other logics can be given in terms of classes of typed lambda terms, i.e. subsets of the typed lambda terms which satisfy certain stated criteria, van Benthem (1983) provides a lambda semantics for the system LP, a eonmmtative variant of L. Wansing (1990) provides lambda semantics for a range of subloglcs of intultlonistie logic. The Curry-tloward interpretation so permeates categorlal work that the terms \"formula\" and \"type\" have become almost interchangeable. Note that I have slightly modified BuszkowsM's notation. satisfy the conditions: (lll) each subterm contains a flee variable, (132) no subterm contains > 1 free occurrenee of any variable, (133) each A t (resp.)?') binds the leftmost (resp. rightmost) free variable in its scope.","This semantics can be used in formulating (implicationM) L as a labelled deductive system (LDS: Gabbay, 1991). a LM)els are terms of the directionM lambdasystern, and propagation of labels is via application and abstraction in the standard manner. Natural deduction rules labelled in this way are as follows:","(2) a/B:a B:b [B:v]","/E A:a","a : (~b) ~ --/I","A/B : X:v.a","B:b B\\A :(~ [B :v]","A : (b~) l \\E~ ___A :a \\~","/3\\A : ,~v.a","We can eusure that only deductions appropriate to (implicational) L are made by requiring that the label that results with any inference is a term satisfying Buszkowski's three conditions. To facilitate testing this requirement, I use a flmction E, which maps from label terms to the string of their free variables occurring in the left-right order that follows from type directionality (giving what I call a marker term).

However, if we require that lexical subcategorisation is stated only using the standard Lambek connectives, then adequate ordering information will always be encoded in labels to allow simple ordering for linguistic derivations. Alternatively, we could allow discontinuity connectives to be used in stating lexical subcategorisation, and farther allow that lexical types be associated with complex sh'ing terms, constrncted using label operators, which encode the requisite ordering information. For example, a word w with lexical type XTY might have a string term ,Vv.(wv)\", which does encode the relative ordering of w and its argument. A more radical idea is that deduction be made over lexical types together with their (possibly complex) lexical string terms, and that the testing of side conditions on inferences be done on the /3-normal form of the end label, so that the implicit ordering information of the lexical string term is 'brought out', extending proof possibilities.
