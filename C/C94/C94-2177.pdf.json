This is a strong motivation for investigating alternative strategies for processing DATR representations. This paper is concerned with the reverse query problem, i.e. the problem how a given DATR value can be mapped onto the queries that evaluate to it. A standard query consists of a node and a path, e.g. Sheep:<orth plur>, an<l evaluates to a sequence, of atoms (value), e.g. sheep. A reverse query, on the other hand, starts with the value, e.g. sheep, and queries the set of node-path pairs which evaluate to it, for instance, Sheep:<orth sing> and Sheep:<orth plur>. Our solution can be be regarded as an inversion of the parsing-as-deduction al)proach of the logic programming tradition, since we treat reverse-query theorem proving as a parsing problem. We adopt a wellknown strategy frora parsing technology: we isolate the context-fi'ee \"backbone\" of DATR and use a modified chart-parsing algorithm for CF-PSG as a theorem prover for reverse queries. I, br the purposes of the present paper we will introduce a DATR notation that slightly differs fi'om the standard notation given in Evans & Gazdar [1989] in the following respects:","• the usual DATR abbreviation conventions are spelled out","* the global environment of a DATR descriptor is explicitly represented (even if it is uninstantiated)","• each node-path pair N:P is associated with the set of extensional suffixes of N:P that are defined within the DATR theory In standard DATR notation, what one might call a non-terminal symbol, is a node-path pair (or an abbreviation for a node-path pair). In our notation a DATR nonterminal symbol is an ordered set [N, P, (7, N', P']. N and N ~ are nodes or variables ranging over nodes. P and P' are paths or variables ranging over paths. C is the set of path suffixes of N:P.","A DATR terminal symbol of a theory 0 is an atom that has at least one occurence in a sentence in 0 where it is not an attribute, i.e. where it does not occur in a path.

These theoretical results may a priori outrule DATR as an implementation language for large scale real time applications, but not as a develot)ment environment for prototype lexica which can be transformed into efficient task-specific on-line lexica (Andry et al. 1992).
