On August 30th. At what time.? At8. Mm~ing or afte~won? In the evening.","TILe parser recognizes Schedule a meeting with Bob as an instance of sent(imp), the imperative construction consisting of a verb and an NP, here up(event). TILe context is used to prevent another reading in which with Bob modifies schedule, as in l)ance a tango with Bob/. That is, a contextual rule is used which says that for calen(lar applications, peotlle do not modify actions or places. Context also plays an important role in understanding answers, e.g. At 8. This is understood as a time expression (and not t)lace or rate or something else) only because of the eontcxt.","The tlarameters of a meeting can be given in many ways, e.g. synonyms or differe, nt constructions can be used, users Call in(hide as many parameters in a senten(:e as they wish, and the parameters can be given in any order. As a result there are about 10,000 ways of scheduling meetings (with a given set of parameters)."]},{"title":"How are the dialogs understood","paragraphs":["With respect to parsing, grammars of constructions can be parsed like \"standard\" grammars, except that tile set of features is richer. Civen a string (representing a sentence, a fragment of a discourse or a paragraph), the parser assigns it a construction. From this viewpoint, the situation is similar to \"regular\" parsing, and the t)ossible algorithms arc, similar. We have implementect a prototype chart parser for construction grammars, disensse, d fllrther in Section 3.","But, c, learly, having understood tile sentence as a linguistic entity in isolation is not the ultimate goal. Here the message of all utterance mils( be understood in tile context of an intended action. This is clone in two steps. First, the system determines the intended 1289 action and its parameters, using domain knowledge (meetings+time+places). Second, once all the parameters have been extracted from tile dialog, the system executes the action. To do this, the program uses application-specific knowledge to translate the action and its parameters lute a form that can be executed by the application (Xdiary)."]},{"title":"2 Constructions as data structures","paragraphs":["A construction is given by the matrix:","N : name_of_construction C : context ] V : structure M : ntessage","The vehicle V consists of formulas describing presence (or perhaps absence) of certain taxemes, or features of form, within the structure of the ('onstruction. Such a structure is given by a list of subconstructions and the way they have been put together (in all our examples this is concatenation, but there are other possibilities, e.g. wrapping). The context, C , consists of a set of semantic and pragmatic constraints limiting the application of the construction. It can be viewed as a set of preconditions that must be satisfied in order for a construction to be used in parsing. The message, M , describes the meaning of the construction, via a set of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints.","To make this concrete, let us consider a few examples. We begin with a simple \"command construction\" consisting of an action verb followed by its argument.","N : senti cmnd, v.np) C : < hr attends >= sr] ]","strue = (V.NP)"]},{"title":"!","paragraphs":["< V cons n >= verb","V < V M v_type >= action_verb < NP eons_n >= np 8ern_eat ~ cogg~gaand","M a_type-< V M sex_type > a_obj =< NP M sex_type > agent = hr","The context of the construction describes all situations in which the the hearer hr (hmnan or machine) is paying attention to the speaker sr (a \"ready\" state). The feature struc is a list of variables and/or words/tokens; it is used to describe the structure of a construction, and its role is similar to a rule in a generative grammar. (We will write names of variables in capital letters, e.g. NP, inside matrices of constructions). The attribute cons_n gives the name of a construction that could be assigned to a string. We use it here to say that the form of the construction can be described as a concatenation of two strings, of which one is a verb ((;onstruction) and the other an nt) (construction). l,hlrthermore, the verb type < V M vAype > is \"action_verb\". (The expression < V M v_type > should be read \"tile v_.type of the message of V\").","The message M describes the meaning of tile construction as that of a command in which tile type of action is described by tile nmaning of the verb, and the object of the action is given by the meaning of the noun phrase. The attribute sex_type stands for the \"semantic type\" and we identify it currently with tile word sense. Thus \"erase the file\" is understood as a command to delete the file, if < erase M sex_type >= delete, but \"erase the picture\" might refer to the type of action associated with rub_out. In both cases the hearer hr is supposed to be tile agent of the action. Constructions: from words to discourse Words~ phrases, and fragments of discourse can be analyzed as constructions. We view languages as collections of constructions which range fi'om words to discourse. We claim that the same representation scheme can be used for all constructions.","The examples we are going to present; have been developed with a specific purpose in mind, namely for scheduling calendar events. In other papers ([10] and [6]), we have presented examples showing that we (:an give a good descriptions of non-standard constructions. However, in either case descriptions of meanings and contexts are general, and hence applicable to other tasks.","We uow turn our attention to words. Tile verb \"cancel\" can be represented as follows:","N :verb(cancel)","[lane_code = english] C : lan.q_ehannel = text V : struc- (cancel)","M : 8era_type = delete v_type -- action_verb Notice that even simple words (prop'orly) interpreted. In C","require context to be","we say that English text is expected (but in other cases it could also be l,¥ench text, or 1,¥ench speech, etc.). Some aspects of context do not have to be explicitly specified and cart be replaced by defaults.","Although the vehicle and the message are both very simple in this example, the simplicity of tile message is a result of deliberate simplification. We have restricted it to the specification of the scream tie type, identified with one sense of tile word, and to describing the xmrb type of \"cancel\" as a verb of action. Notice that the other sense of\" cancel\" -\"off-set, balance out\" wouht appear ill another entry.","Of course, in reality, tile lexical meaning of any word is a much more complicated matter [1]. For instance, in our lexicon tile messages of words may contain many of the attrilmtes that appear in the 1290 explanatory combinatorial dictionary of Meleuk [7].","Discourse constructions: qb illustrate discourse constructions, we consider the folh)wing dialog:"]},{"title":"Have you arranged the worn yet?

Fillmore and his colleagues (ef. [31). Their motivation for advocating such an approach comes from the fact that typical generative theories of grammar cannot deal tu:operly with open idioms illustrated by constructions such as:","The morc carefully you work, the easier it will get.","Why not fix it yourself?","Much as I like fgonnie, I don't approve of any-thing he does.","It's time you brushal your teeth.","Him be. a doctor? The same is true about even so-called robust parsers of English. The reason for this failure can be attributed to the fact that expressions like these \"exhibit properties that are not fully predictable from independently known properties of its lexical make-up and its grammatical structure\" [3], p.511. However we do not need a list; of \"strange\" constructions m conclude that ~horoughly integrating syntax with semantics and pragmatics could provide us with a better handle on natnral language understanding. On a closer examination \"normal\" construetions exhibit enough complexity to warrant the new approach (see [10] for details).","Jurafsky [4] has independently come up with a proposal for a computable grammar of constructions. We compare our work with his in [10]. Here, we limit ourselves to a few remarks. What is common in both approaches is the centrality of the concept of grammatical construction as a data structure that represents lexical, semantic and syntactic knowledge. However, there are important differences between the two formalisms. First, the actual data structures used to represent constructions are different. The most important differenee has to do with the presence of the context field in our version of the construction grammar. This allows us to account for the importance of pragmatics in representing many constructions, and to deal with discourse construe-tions.","Secondly, while Jnrafsky acknowledges the need for abstract constructions (pp.43-51), his abstract constructions (weak constructions) are not first class citizens they are defined only extensionally, by specifying the set of constructions they abstract over, and their abstract meaning (e.g. entity for"]},{"title":"NOUN).","paragraphs":["They are used to simplify descriptions of constituents of other constructions. However, because they do not have a separate vehicle part, they cannot be used to assign default meanings. For instance, since verb is defined as a collection of all verbs is + read + can-cel 4- know + look-up + ..., it cannot be assigned a feature action_verb without introducing a contra- /292. diction its semantics is therefore given as RELA-TION/I'I~OCESS. For us the important feature of \"abstract\" constructions is not that they simplify (tescriptions of other constructions, trot that they have default meanings. (A similar critique of [5] can be found in [10])."]},{"title":"5 Summary of results","paragraphs":["Our at)preach to NI,U is based both on linguistic arguments and on our dissatisfaction with the state of the art. State of the art systclns typically are too \"syntax-driven\", failing to take context into account in determining the intended meaning of sentences. A related further weakness is that such sysreins are typically \"sentcnce oriented\", rather than \"conversation/diseourse oriented\", lit our view, this nmkes even the most robust systems \"brittle\" and ultimately impractical.","To test whether a construction-based approach is feasible built a \"complete\" working system that would include a representation for constructions. To do this, we focused on the \"calendar domain\", a domain with limited comi)lexity and simt)le but not nninteresting semantics. We have chosen to deal with simple actions, and not e.g. with question answering, where dee, per understanding would be necessary. 3 Our contributions: 1. We. have t)roposed a new kind of grammar computable construction grammars, which are neither semantic, nor syntactic. Instead, their \"productions\" combine lexieal, syntacti(', semantic and pragmatic information. 4 2. We have described data structures for constructions, and have shown that they can be effectively used by the parser. Note that the same data structure is used to encode tile lexicon anti the \"syntactic\" forms. 3. We have shown how to parse with~ constr~lctions. We have implemented a simple chart parsing algorithm, which carl be easily extended to an Eearly-like parser, as h)ng as tire construction granmlar remains L-attributed. We have found that even a simple parser of construction ear be quite ef[icient. This is partly due to the fact that it does not require copy-ing of all syntactic and semantic information from daughters to mothers; the goal of parsing consists in producing an interpretation, and strnetural information can be discarded once an intertn.etation of a phrase is produced. ]t is also worth e.mt)hasizing","aWe have also thought about anoLher possibility, that is, enhancing an IR system, e..g. with the understanding of date expressions.","4In what sense are they \"computable\"? Althmtgh this adjective might sugge.st a formal model with computational complexity results, etc., what we have in mind ix pretty trivial: (1) the systcm actually computes the messages of grammatical construction; (2) the grammars and constructions are well defined data structures, and l)arsing (combining all associated constructions in all possible ways) is decidable. that invoking domain semantics drastically reduces the number of parses constructed. 4. We have proposed a modular architecture for NL interfaces based on the division between linguistic knowledge, domain knowledge base, and application knowledge base. Based on our experience, we be-lieve that this architecture should work in general for speech-enabled interfaces for restricted domains."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Computational Linguistics.
