In Thai language, it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun, both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers. Basically, there is no exact rule for classifier selection. As far as we can do in the rule~based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun. Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types ,are open due to the meaning of representation. We propose a corpus-based method (Biber,1993; Nagao,1993; Smadja,1993) which generates Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase. The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences. Keywords: Thai language, classifier, corpus-based method, Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) 1. Introduction A classifier has a significant use in Thai language tbr construction of noun or verb to express quantity, determination, pronoun, etc. By far the most common use of classifiers, however, is in enumerations, where the classifiers follow numerals and precede demonstratives (Noss,1964). Not all types of classifier have a relationship with noun or verb as a unit classifier does."]},{"title":"A unit classifier","paragraphs":["is any classifier which has a special relationship with one or more concrete nouns.

The member of this class of classifier is closed for each noun. Most of the unit classifiers m'e used with a great many concrete nouns of very different meaning, but few are restricted to a single noun. Except for the unit classifier, the members of classifier for a noun or predicate are open. Especially for the metric classifier, the number of classifiers for numeral expression of distance, size, weight, container and value is large.","The use of classifier in Thai is not limited to the nunmral expression but is extended to other expressions such as ordinal, determination, relative pronoun, pronoun, etc. The detail of each classifier phrase is described in the next section.","In many existing natural language processing systems, tile list of available classifiers lk3r each noun is attached to a lexicon base. Rules for classifier selection from the list can somehow provide the 556 dcfault value but does not guarantee thc appropriateness, tlowever, the problems on classifier phrase construction still remain unsolved.","To overcome the problems of using classifiers, we propose a method of classifier phrase extracting fl'om a large corpus. As a result, Noun-Classifier Associations (dcscribcd in Section 3) is statistically created to define the relationship between a noun and a classifier in a classifier phrase. With the li'equency of tile occurrence of a classifier in a classifier phrase, we can propose the most apl)rot)riate use of a classilier. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchy of semantic class for tile induction of a classifier class when they are employed to construct with nouns which belong to the same class of meaning.

Extraction of Noun-Classifier Collocation","paragraphs":["1,1 this section, wc describe tile algorithm used for extraction of Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) from a large corpus. We used a 40 megabyte Thai coq)us collected from wu'ious areas to create tile table. The algorithm is as follows: Step 1: Word segmentation. Input: A corpus. Output: The wordosegmented corpus. hi text processing, we often need word boundary information lot several puqmses. Because Thai has no explicit raarke, to separate words from one another, we have to prcprocess the corpus with word segmentation program. We used the program developed by Sornlcrthmwanich (1993) with post-editing to correct fault segmcntation. The program employs heuristic rules of longest malching and least word count incoq)orated with character combining rules for Thai words. Though tile accuracy of the word segmentation does not reach 100%, but it is high enough (more than 95%) to reduce the post-~iting time. Step 2: Tagging. Input: Output of step 1. Output: The corpus of which each word is tagged with a part of speech and a semantic class. The word-segmented corpus is then processed with a stochastic paWof.-st)eed, tagger. Each word w together with its part of speech is then used to reUieve the semantic class of tile word fiom a dictionary. The result yields a data structure of (w,p,s), where p denotes the pm-t of speech of w and s denotes the semantic chtss of w. For example, the data structure of the word fihf~mA hlakrian/'student' is (ffnt~ou, NCMN, person), where NCMN stml(ls for common noun and t)crson rel)rescnts ffntTml in file class of person.

Actually, A--B can be 559 separated by several arbitrary words but in our experiments we considered only possible separations by a relative pronoun phrase having no more than 5 words. This is to limit the search space of general cases to a manageable size with some loss of generality.","The pattern matching process was carried out one by one with each pattern. For each pattern of A- - B-C, the matching of B-C pair was simple and was performed at first. Next, the matching of a pair A- -B was done by:","1. searching for the nearest A from B. If found, mark AI.","2. from B within a span of five, searching for the nearest relative pronoun. If found, mark pl then go to 3. Otherwise, match A1.","3. further searching for the nearest A from p 1. If found, mark A2. If A2 is farther from B than A1, match A2. Otherwise, match A I.","At the end of these steps, we obtained a list of nouns Ni along with the frequency of w in the corpus for each matching pattern (see Fig. 3.1 for sample ouqmts). Each entry is of the form (W_N1, CLN2, Freq) where W denotes a noun, N1 denotes a number representing semantic class of W, CL denotes the associated classifier, N2 is a number indicating whether CL is a unit or collective classifier (1 for unit, 2 for collective) and Freq denotes the frequency of co-occurrence between W and CL. The semantic class is shown in Fig. 3.2. Step 5: Determine representative classifier Input: A list of noun-classifier with frequency information of co-occurrence. Output: Representative classifier of each noun and each semantic class of nouns.","As it can be observed in Fig. 3.1, each noun may be used with several possible classifiers. In language generation process. However, we have to select only one of them. For each noun we select the classifier with the greatest value of co-occurrence frequency to be the representative classifier for both representative unit classifier and representative collective classifier. Tile classifier in Fig. 3.1, for example, will have ~__1 as the representative unit classifier and have n~ 2 as the representative collective one for the noun sm~nr~unq'~ 111. Collective classifiers are used instead of unit classifiers when the notion of \"group' is required.","We also find the representative classifier for each semantic class of nouns in the same manner. For each semantic class of nouns (grouped by the semantic class attached with each noun), the classifier with the greatest value of co-occurrence frequency is selected to be the representative. The classifier is used to handle the assignment of classifier to noun which does not exist in the trained corpus. For example, the representative unit classifiers for each semantic class extracted by the pattern (N- -NCNM-CL) are shown in Fig. 3.3. 4. Classifier Resolution The associations as produced in the previous section are useful for determining a proper classifier for a given noun. For a noun occurring ill the corpus, alternative determination is accomplished in a straightforward manner by using its associated representative classifier which occurs in the corpus more frequently than any other classifiers. In the other case where the given noun does not exist in tile corpus, the determination is done by using the representative classifier of its class in the concept hierarchy.","Some examples of classifier determining are listed below. (1) and (3) show the case of nouns appearing in the corpus, while (2) and (4) show a different scenario. In (2), the unit classifier of/appem/ is obtained by using the representative unit classifier of its class \"fruit' which is ~n_~ /luuld according to Fig. 3.3. Similarly, in (4), the collective classifier of /gangkerd is determined by the representative collective classifier of its class \"animal' which is ~2 /fuung].","Semantic class Unit classifier Collective classifier animal ~'L"]},{"title":"1 ~.~_2","paragraphs":["human ~u I ~m~2 plant ~u_l fruit"]},{"title":"nnl","paragraphs":["Fig. 3.3 NCA for representative classifier 560 Unit classifier /nakrian kon tit sit/ student <sttident> number four v","(2) mnlfi'ka ~]n lint /appern luuk nail apple <apple> which","Collective classifier","(3) ~ul:n~m~ ~ut.~ un /kanagammagarn kana nan/ committee . group that","(4) ,m,~u ~ ~Tu /gangken fuung nan/ magpie group that Linguistics, Vol. 19, No.3, Set)tember 1993.","[2] Nagao, Makato.

Conclusion \"File proposed approach is a significantly new method to manipulate the classifier phrase in Thai language. The fact that the expression of some syntactic constituents needs a specific classifier to be constnmted with and the selection of classifier lot each noun or noun phrase depends on tile traditional use and the senmntic class. The corpus-based approach is quite suitable for detecting the traditional use and searching for the most appropriate one wlmn it does not exist in the corpus yet. Concept hierarchy of noun provides another path for searching when the NCA does not cover the noun in question.","In the future, this NCA will be included in the generation process of Machine Translation to solve the classifier assignment, and incoqmrated in the analysis process to produce a proper syntactic and semantic structure. The classifier will then be a key for pattern disambiguation when it is fixed to one of the patterns illustrated in Fig. 2.1.
