This article reports on \"Parsody\", an experimental system which combines a partial parser with a prosodic marking component to predict the location and relative strength of prosodic boundaries in text. INTRODUCTION Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems are quite good at word level synthesis, but tend to perform badly on connected word sequences. It has been suggested that the poor prosody of synthetic connected speech is the primary factor leading to difficulties in comprehension [1,5]. TTS systems must therefore incorporate better mechanisms for prosodic processing. For the purpose of this article, prosodic processing is narrowly interpreted as being the prediction of the location and of the relative strengths (salience) of prosodic boundaries (although, of course, there are several other important aspects to prosody). A prosodic boundary is a point in a spoken utterance associated with important acoustic prosodic phenomena, such as pauses and pitch change. There are two main approaches to the prosodic marking problem : the rule-based approach and the stochastic-based approach. The rule-based approach stems from Gee and Grosjean's work on performance structures 1 [7], which has been the focus of many extensions, such as that reported by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick [2,4]. Gee and Grosjean's work sought to account for the (then) disparity between linguistic phrase-structure theories and actual performance structures produced by humans, and focused on recreating the pause data of several analysed sentences from syntax (althougtt they claim that their method could easily account for other prosodic features). The central tenet of their work was that prosodic phrasing is a compromise between the need to respect the linguistic structure of the sentence and the performance aspect (which manifests itself as a need to balance the length of the constituents in the output). More recent efforts have extended the Gee and Grosjean approach in various ways. Bachenko and Fitzpatrick take a similar rule-based approach but believe that syntax plays a lesser role in determining phrasing, and that certain prosodic performance constraints, such as length, override syntactic structure. They allow prosodic boundaries to cross syntactic boundaries (under certain conditions), whereas Gee and Grosjean viewed their 1 Performmme structures are \"structures based on experimental data, such as pausing and parsing values\" [7]. rules as acting within basic sentence clauses. Bachenko and Fitzpatrick made several other changes to the basic"]},{"title":"Gee","paragraphs":["and Grosjean algorithm, including counting phonological words 2 rather than actual words when determining node strengths. Wightman et al. have proposed some further interesting extensions to the Bachenko and Fi~patrick method [12]. With the availability of large and accurately labelled prosodically annotated corpora, the stochastic-based approach will come more to the fore. Wang and Hirschberg [11], and Ostendorf et al. [9], have both described methods for automatically predicting prosodic information using decision tree models. Generally, decision trees are derived by associating a probability with each potential boundary site in the text, and relating various features with each boundary site (e.g. utterance and phrase duration, length of utterance (in syllables/words), positions relative to the start or end of the nearest boundary location etc.) [11]. The resulting decision tree provides, in effect, an algorithm for predicting prosodic boundaries on new input texts. It is interesting to note that Ostendorf et al. report similar results in their evaluations of the performance of both the rule-based and decision tree algorithms. THE PARSODY SYSTEM Our approach has been to implement a rule-based method on top of a chart parser. This was a purely practical decision, as an efficient chart parser had been developed in-house. Also the larger and more detailed descriptions of the rule-based methods in the literature provided an adequate starting point on which to build. The resulting system, the Parsody (from Parser + Prosody) system is designed to provide a test-bed for investigating the interface between syntactic parse structures and the performance structures of actual speech. Results from the Parsody system are directly led into BT's TTS system, Laureate. The fact that Laureate will be a commercial TPS system places several requirements on the parser, it must be robust, it must be fast, and it must predict prosodic boundaries with a reasonable degree of accuracy. At present the emphasis is on the prediction of the location of prosodic boundaries rather than on the strength of the boundaries. The Parsody system is implemented in C, under Xwindows on a Sun Sparc station, and allows for interactive editing of intermediate results throughout the parsing/prosodic marking process. This provides us 2A phonological word is one which effectively functions as one spoken item, as the internal word-word boundaries are resistant to pausing [7]. Typical examples are determiner-noun word groups, such as \"the+man\". 992 with a useful tool for investigating our algorithms, as A typical tree is shown in Figure I.

The basic algorithm is also different. By extending the grouping of nodes to cover all nodes, the confusion of Bachenko and Fitzpatrick's \"general bundling rulc\" is avoided, since all nodes will have becn grouped at completion. The change to the algorithm is more subtle, yielding thc rule:","if Count(X) + Cmmt(Y) < Count(Z) then Join to the Left(Y) else Join to tile Right(Y) where : Count(a) = Number of Phonological Words","beneath Node 'a' X = Previous Nnde Y = Current N(~le Z = Next Node This makes explicit the assumption in Bachenko and Fitzpatrick's algorithm that tile adjoining of phrases pr(xluces a balancezt tree. The above approach continues to balance the structure created so far, with the phonological phrases which have not yet been joined into the structure. By doing this, the boundary values (strengths/salience) remain dependent on the values of the constituent prosodic phrases. in the example shown in Figure 2, tile left-to-right nature of application of this rule ensures that earlier material will generally be gronpcd lower in the structure than later material. This ties in with Gee and Gmsjean's work on discourse semantics: the later in the sentence 993 Ihe information, the greater the prosodic offset. It is at this stage that PP's which p}ecede verbs are added into the structure (assuming they haven't been already). The proviso is continued that PP's should always join to the left, rather than the right.

Experience would suggest that this is not a realistic s,'unple of sentences from which to work. Bachenko and Fitzpatrick have converted these sentences to their notation. This results in catch sentence having only one primary boundary, and all but one sentence having eric secondary botmdary. Furthermore, the primary boundary nearly always appears at the mid-point of the sentence.

Despite the high performance of the word tagger, the effect of wrongly tagging a word is large, since the prosody component uses this information to construct a prosody tree in a bottom-up fashion. To improve the tagging performance we ,are considering including word collocation statistics. Also, it would be desirable to increase the range of syntactic structures produced by the parser. To improve the parser performance we are looking at extending the minimal grammar, but in such a way that processing speed is maintained. Future versions of the parser may also include special disambiguation roles concenlrating on words having multiple pronunciations. Topic and focus marking will also be introduced at some stage. We also hope to investigate the stochastic approach to prosodic marking. Future work will focus on assembling a suitable corpus, it is likely that the best prosodic marking procedare is one which is a hybrid of both the rule-based and stochastic-based approaches. As was mentioned earlier, the immediate goal with respect to prosodic marking has been the prediction of prosodic boundary location and of the tx)undary strengths. Future work will concentrate on the interpretation of boundary slrengths, for cxample by investigating the corrclafion of our normalised (hence gradable) boundaries with acoustic phenomena at Ihcse boundaries. Finally, it is important to remember the intended goal of text-to-speech systems is to synthesise unrestricted text input, hfitial work has begun on extending the evaluation of the system to more 'normal' sentences. For example, work in BT's Natural Language Group includes automatic text summarisation; in tests on the summarisation of newspaper articles the length of sentences often exceeds 100 words. Our text-to-speech system must be able to handle such sentences efficiently both at the parsing and prosody stage. The lessons learnt from more difficult input such as this, may serve to increase our understanding of the relationship between syntax and prosody.
