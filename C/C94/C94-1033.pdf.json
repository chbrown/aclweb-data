Thus, Japanese morphological analysis involves a large number of dictionary accesses.","The standard technique for handling this problem is to use the TRIE structure to find all the words that begin at a given position in a sentence (Morimoto and Aoe 1993). This process is executed for every character position in the sentence; that is, after looking up all the words beginning at position n, the program looks up all the words beginning at position n + 1, and so on. Therefore, some characters may be scanned more than once for different starting positions.","This paper describes an attempt to minimize this 'backtracking' by using an idea similar to one proposed by Aho and Corasick (Aho 1990) for multiple-keyword string matching.
