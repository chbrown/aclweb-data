In tile target languages, a compound nominal is as a role to be rendered by an NP with an adjective or genitive attribute, or with an attrilmtive participle construction. The model is based on Bierwisch's theory of word formation, which in turn is inspired by categorial grammar. The procedure is applied to a specific domain (asthma research). 0. INTItOI)UCTION","The need of a component interpreting complex lexical items in an MT system translating fl'om Germanic languages into e.g. French or Slavic languages is obvious. Many rules (or patterns) of word fo,'mation are highly productive, which makes it impossible to store all complex lexical entries in a static lexicon.","An effective MT system rnust also be able to match the interpretation of a complex entry with the correct morphosyntactic pattern in the target language.

Lees 1960, Selkirk 1982, Fanselow 1988, Bierwisch 1989) require as a rule several modifications in order to be applicable ill an MT system. Since, in our opinion, a model aimed to serve as an efficient tool for NLP and MT mnst be linguistically valid, we will discuss a number of theoretical questions and relate our model to general linguistics beRn'e presenting our experimental procedure t'or domain-restricted compound translation. 1. Till,; STATUS OF WORI) FORMATION RUIA,;S 1.1. 'Where's nmrphology?'","The above question, put by Stephen Anderson 1982, is still waiting for a definitive answer. Word for,nation rules have been claimed to obey syntactic principles and hence being a part of UG (Lees 1960, Pesetsky 1985), to form a grammatical level on their own (Di Sciullo & Williams 1987), to be explainable in semantic terms solely (Fanselow 1988) or to belong to the lexicon (Chomsky 1970, Jackendoff 1975, Bierwisch 1989).","We will propose a quite simple answer to Anderson's question: morphology shall be seen ;is a component of the grammar, tim notion 'grammar' to be understood as an integrated fnodel where no borders are drawn between syntax, morphology, and semantics. 1.2. Towards an integration of syntax, semantics and morphology","Fanselow (1985, 1988)argues, on tile basis of psycholinguistic evidence, for treating word fornmtion rules not ;is generative processes, but as a 'primitive' process of co,acatcnating morphematic items, a very easily learnable procedure. His argumentation is restricted to morphology in the traditional sense of tim term. We would like to go even further and clailn that tile gralnmal\" as a whole can be regarded as a set of patterns {'of concalolVdtion or COOCllITellCe of lexical items, each concatenatio,~ pattern associated with principles of semantic interpretation. This approach is to some extent inspired by (but far l'ronl identical to) categorial grammar and gierwisch's lexicon theory (P, ierwisch 1989). At tile same time, it is in its very essence not incompatible with Constraint Grannnar (Karlsson 1990, Koskenniemi 1990). 1.3. Compounds as collocations","English compounds provide an argument in ['avour of our approach to grammar. It seems impossible to draw a clear-cut borderline between strings traditionally labelled its 4,5 compounds and those classified as noun phrases. Cf.:the following examples, taken from a corpus of medical abstracks: ragweed allergic dffnitis house-thtst-allergic a,vthma house chtst asthma patient daily symptom diary cards fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray","In most grammatical descriptions, strings consisting of nouns (like house dust asthma) are treated as compound nouns, whereas a complex including an adjective followed by a' noun is normally labelled as an NP. The above examples show, however, that such a distinction is not unproblcmatic. Phrases like house-dust-allergic asthma and.fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray may be analysed either as NPs containing a compound adjective and a head noun, or as compounds including optional adjective constituents (hottse dust asthma and fluticasone ,wray are perfectly well-formed). Furthermore, parts of an English compound may provide referents for elliptic constructions, as in the following examples: The variations in provocation concentrations ... were small during both placebo aml active drug treatment the d~fference between a single allergen provocation and continltotts exposure... Thus, a noun included in a compound can still have a referent on its own, an ability normally associated with nominal phrases. Such facts in-dicate that there is no absolute distinction to be drawn between compound nominals and complex nominal phrases in English. It seems more appropriate to talk about morn or less lexicalized collocations. However, in the following the traditional term 'compound' will be used. 2. AUTOMATIC INTIqlPilETATION AND TRANSLATION OF COMPOUNi)S 2.1. The theoretical foundation","Bierwisch (1989; cf also Olsen 1991) regards the process of compounding as a functional application, where one of the thematic roles of the head noun becomes 'absorbed'. For example, a noun like payer is supposed to have the following interp,'etation: )~y)~x[zINST[xPAYy]], where y is the external theta-role, x the internal one, mad z represents the 'referential role'. In a compound like bill payer, the internal role of pay becomes instantiated: )vx[zINST[xPAY BILL]].","Our analysis of compounds is not incompatible with Bierwisch's approach. However, for the purpose of MT, a classification of valency in terms of three kinds of theta roles only (external, internal and referential) seems insufficient. A procedure for compound interpretation must also take into account optional thematic roles, e.g. location (tmive~wio, teacher). It must in addition be able to deal with compounds that do not include deverbal components. IIence, we decided to modify the theory proposed by Bierwisch at two main points: a. the valency of a verbal stem is to be represented not in terms of external and internal them roles, but in terms of the components of the event or situation the verb may refer to b. the interpretation of compounds that do not contain deverbal elements is based on morpho-semantic patterns specifying the default readings of combinations that include members of dilTferent semantic categories. 2.2 An experimental procedure for understanding derived nouns and compounds","In an experimental program, implemented in LPA MacProlog, we structured a very restricted lexicon of Swedish stems and affixes (basal lexical ent,'ies, BI.A) according to the approach outlined above. Each verbal stem was provided with a list of elements of its typical event referent, e.g.:","lex([ l~ir],m(teach,stem),v,vt,[ agent, sem_object,domain,place,time,resultl,[]). Affixes were specified with respect to the following features: 0 the category or categories of stems the affix may be combined with 0 the resulting category, including the morphosyntactic specification 0 the default semantic interpretation of the affix. For example, the Swedish agcntive suffix -are was represented as: slex([ arel,su ff(n,agr(sg,re,inde f)),v,agent,[]). Underived nouns got a quite simplified semantic specifcation formulated in tradilional terms like 'human', 'animate', 'abstract', 'concrete', 'potential location' etc. On this basis, the interprctation procedure tried to match the semantic specification of the affix or of the noun and associate the morphcmaiic entries attached to the verb stem with the most probable elements of 46 the stem's semantic valency. The program distinguished correctly between coml+ounds like grammatikliimre (teacher of"]},{"title":"gl'itllllllal')","paragraphs":["and tolivetwitetslih'are (university teacher), as shown in the following outprint. :- analym([grammatikl;,iraml)","m(Idomain(grammar), head ( m (I agen t(su ff),","head(teach) l))l) category: n agr(sg, re, indel +) constituents [grammatik, 1;,irate, []fir, :tre tl :- analyse([universitetsl;,irarel)","m([ place(university), head(m([agent(suff),","head(teach)]))l) category: n agr(sg, re, indef) constituents [universitet, l£irare, I I~ir, atoll","The program wits also able to interpret somewhat unusual, but I'ully possil+le compounds like ttniversitervmi)rdare (university killer). In the case of 'university killer', three alternative interpretations were given, all of them acceptable in Swedish: l) a person who kills in university buildings, 2) somebody who causes destruction of a university, 3) somehody who uses a university for destructive purposes. The flexibility of the quite simple interpretation procedure and its ahility to 'undcrst:md' even unusual complex words encouraged us to apply the method tested by means ol7 the toy program fflr a more serious goal, viz. for interpretation and translation of rncdical abstracts dealing with asthma and allergy research. 2.3. Translation o1\" compounds within ;l restricted domain (medical texts ml asthma and allergy research) 2.3.1. Domain-related requirements","In order to construct a domain specific lexicon and to design apl)ropriate parsing and translation algorithms, we investigated a corpus of about 140 medical abstracts. Already the preliminary inspecticm provided evidence for the need of a special procedure for COmlmund interpretation. The frequency of compounds in the texts was extremely high. Cf. the following sample: A large-scale mttlticenter investigation was undertaken in 3 cities with c'Oml)aral.~le pollen seasons and atmospheric pollen concentrations in order to obtain+ more dell'nile it~flormatiot7 about the sa/'ety and +q[icacy o['cromolyn sodium in the treatment of pollen-induced seasonal rhinitis.","Complex names of chemical substances, as cromolyt~ soditm,, do not pose especially great prohlems to an MT system, since chemical symbols may be efficiently used as interlingual representations. Highly lexicalized and highly idiosyncratic compoutv, ls, like airways or hay fi, ver, may also he stored in tim basic lexicon. The rnain difficulty lies rather in the translation of productive compounds referring to different allergic syudroms, types of medical treatment and patient groups (ragweed pollen asthma, late-stmtmer rhinilis, Jhmisolide test,.lhmisolMe patient group etc.). In different texts, tile same syndrom may be referred to by different phrases, e.g. ragweed asthma, ragwood-in-dttced asthnla, ra,~wood pollen asttuna, ragwood-allergic asthma etc. A correct interpretation of the semantic relations between tile constituents of such collocations is necessary for correct translation. Otherwise, a phrase like child/~ood o.vthma \\vcmhl be translated into French itot its asthme des etfrmts, bttt as ¢tsthme inchtit par el!/?race (lit. asthma induced by childhood-by analogy to e.g. pyrethrltm asthma-ctslhme induit ]mr ]~yr+;thrines). A procedure for interpretation of compounds and complex NPs must therefore include a kind ol' domain know+ lc¢lge, preferably encoded in the lexicon. 2.3.2. The lexicon","An MT system aimed at translatkm of scientific texts should give tile user a possibility el\" adding new entries to the lexicon in a simple way. A system for medical abstract translation would n{~t be really useful, if the user could not introduce names of new medicines, new terms denoting syndroms, symptoms, treatment me-. thods etc. Since the users of such a .system would, with a high degree of probability, be a non-linguist, the linguist designing the method for lexicon extension lntlst adapt the form of interactions to the expected competence of the I.iser.","It would be naive to helive that a non-linguist could manage to specify tile lexical items in terms of internal and external theta~roles. Even terms like agent, theme and semantic object would prohably cause confusion, l-lence, it seems most reasonable to fornmlate the se,nan-tic classification in do,nain-spccific texts (in our case, in terms like allergen, syndrom, body-part etc.). There are actually linguistic reasons for this solutiotl, as scientific sublanguages differ semantically from each other as well as from the everyday conversation language. For a botanist, pyrethrum is primarily +a plant belonging to the chrysanthemum family, whereas an allergy re-47 searcher regards pyrethrum as an allergy-inducing factor, having much in common with grass pollen and house dust.","In the preliminary model of the lexicon developed until now we classify nouns as members of the following categories: - syndrom (asthma, rhinitis) - symptom (sneezing, irritation) - allergen (pyrethrum, ragweed) - body part (airways, skin) - body function (inhalation) - chemical substance:","medicine (antihistamine) or","not used as medicine (histamine) - medical treatment (injection) - scientific method (measurement, test) - time period (season, childhood) - lmman: patient or not (the later distinction is","needed for con'ect interpretation of e.g."]},{"title":"asthma patient","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"asthma researcher)","paragraphs":["- amount: mass or countable (dose, group) - others: concrete or abstract 2.3.3.

If the verb in question turns out to be transitive, a further question is asked about the semantic category of the typical object, according to the standard category list. The specification of verbs takes more time than the one of nouns and adjectives. However, the need of introducing new verbs is ~su:dly not as great as the need o17 adding new nouns. 2.3.4. Compound interpretation and generation of target equivalents","The present program covers the most frequent types of compounds found in the corpus. After having filtered out the most fl'equent verbs (:mxiliaries, medals) and items belonging to closed lexical classes (pronouns, articles, prepositions etc.), we first investigated word frequencies, and then the (unfiltered) environment of about the thirty most frequent words. On this basis, we could state that the most usual compounds containing the most frequent nouns (disregarding names of chemical substances) display the following patterns: i.

For the time heing, we use a parsins procedure based on a combination of dependency grammar and categorial grammar.

The function o1\" ambiguous items, like result, control etc., may often be identified on tim basis of their evironmeut: if tile word in question is immediately preceded by a preposition and/or an article, it can be easily identified as a nominal element.
