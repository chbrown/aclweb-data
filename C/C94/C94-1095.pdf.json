Silberztein","Laboratoirc d'Automatiquc 1)ocumentaire ct Linguistique Universil6 Paris 7 ABSTRACT INTEX is a text processor; it is usually used to parse corpora of several megabytes. It includes several built-in large coverage dictionaries and grammars represented by graphs; the user inay add his/her own dictionaries and gramnlars. These tools am applied to texts in order to locate lexical and syntactic patterns, remove ambiguities, and tag words. INTEX builds collcordances and indexes of all types of patterns; it is used by linguists to analyse corpora, but can also be viewed as an information feb'lewd system. INTROI)UCTION INTEX automatically identities words and morpho-syntactic patterns in large texts. By using INTEX, one can: .... build the dictionary of lhe words of the texts; words may be simple words (sequences of letters, e.g. table), compounds (sequences of simple words which include a separator, e.g. worU pro~ cessor) or complete expressions (sequences of words which accept insertions, e.g. to kick ... the bucket); --- locate in texts all occurrences of a given word (even if inflected), a given category (e.g. all feminine plural adjectives) or a morpho-syniactic pat~ tern (a regular expression); --apply grammars represented by recursive graphs to texts; build indexes or concordances for all occurrences of the previous patterns; .... use local grammars to remove word and ullerance ambiguities in texts, or to detect errors or deviant sequences. While INTEX already i,lcludes several built-in dictionaries and granunars, it allows tile user to create, c(lit and add his/her own tools, hi order to increase coverage of texts and to remove additional ambiguilies. 1.

INTEX includes a few other dictionaries for proper names, toponyms, acronyms, etc.; --the DELACF dictionary contains over 150,000 compounds, mostly nouns 3. Each entry in the DELACF is associated with its canonical form, its part of speech, and some inflectional information. Here are three entries of the French DELACF:","h tout de suite, h tout de suite. ADV","cartes bleues, carte bleue. N:fp","pomme de terre, pomme de terre. N:fs INTEX includes a few other dictionaries for compound proper names. The use,\" may add his/her own dictionaries for simple words and compounds. 1.2. Finite State Transducers FSTs are represented in INTEX by recursive graphs. Basically, the \"input\" part of an FST is used to identify patterns in texts; the \"output\" part of an FST is used to associate each identified occurrence with information. In many cases, FSTs represent words more naturally than dictionaries. For example, numerical determiners, such as trente-cinq mille neuf cents trente-qttatre, for-really are compounds which are naturally represented by graphs (see the graph Dmlm in Appendix 1). FSTs may also be used to bring together graphical variants of a woM in order to check the spelling coherency, to associate all the variants of a term with a unique canonical ent,'y in an index, to represent families of derived words (see the graph France in Appendix 1), to associate synonyms of a term in an information retrieval system, etc. In the graph editor, gray nodes are graph names; tags written in white nodes are the inputs of the FSTs, outputs are written below nodes 4. The user draws graphs directly 3. For a discussion on the completeness of the DELACF, see in [Courtois; Silberztein 1989]. 4. For a description of the graph editor of INTEX, see [Silberztein 1993]. on the screen; the resulting graphs a're interpreted as FSTs by INTEX. By selecting and applying dictionaries and FSTs to a text, the user builds the dictionary of the words of the text. Appendix 1 shows the resulting dictionary, as well as the list of all unknown tokens. Generally, these tokens are either spelling errors or proper names. 2. LOCATING PATTERNS After having built the dictionary of the words of the text, the user can locate morpho-syntaetic patterns in the corpus, index o1' build a concordance for all occurrences of the pattern. Patterns may be: --a word, or a list of words. For example, one can locate in a text all occurrences of the verb faire (even when inllected), all the compound nouns (since most of them are non-ambiguous terms, their list constitutes a good index); --a given category, such as verb conjugated in the third person sitzgttlar (V:3s), or noun in the feminine plural (N:fp), etc. Here arc several examples of categories5:","A:p (adjective in plural), ADV (adverb),","DE7\".'f (femirzine determirzer),","DKms (past participle, mascttline singular), etc. --a syntactic pattern represented by a regular expression or a graph; the following is a regular expression:","<t?tre> (<ADV> + <E>) <DET> <N> This pattern re'Itches any sequence beginning with a conjugated form of the verb e?tp'e, optionally followed by an adverb (<E> stands for the null word), followed by a determiner and then a noun. Note that categories match simple and compound words. In particular; <ADV> also matches compound adverbs. More generally, the use,\" may apply to the text grammars expressed by recursive graphs; graphs typically represent: -- sees of synonymous expressions, such as : perdre Ia t~te, l'esprit, le nord, etc. Graphs in differ-5. For a syntactic description of the categories, see [Silberztein 19931. 580 ent languages can be linked, so that each matching sequence in the source language could be automatically associated with the corresponding graph in the target hmguage (e.g. lose one's head, mind, bearings, etc.). A graph may represent all the expressions which designate an entity, or a process; indexing such graphs allows one to retrieve information in large corpora; -- pieces of a large-coverage grammar of the language. Recnrsive graphs are easily edited; standard operations on graphs (union, intersection, differences, etc.) help to build an easily mainrained system of hundreds of elementary graphs. This construction has begun in LADL; we already have graphs describing adverbial complements which express a measure (temperature, speed, length, etc.), a time or a date (e.g. le 17 fdvrier 1993, le premier hmdi du mois de jnin) (Maurel 1989), some locative structures (Garrigues 1993), etc. 3. REMOVING AMBIGUITIES In order to disambiguate words in texts, INTEX uses cache dictionaries and local grammars. 3.1. Cache dictionaries Since the DELAF and DELACF dictionaries included in INTEX have a very large coverage, they contain a number of words which only occur in some specific domains; in addition, some fiequent words may be associated with generally inappropriate information. For instance, par is usually a preposition in French, but in some cases it may be a noun (a technical term in gol[). By default, each occurrence of this token will be considered ambiguous (preposition or noun). Cache dictionaries are used as filters: if INTEX finds a word in a cache dictionary, it will not look tip the selected dictionaries and FSTs. If the user knows that in a given corpus, the token par is always a proposition, he/she enters the following entry in a cache dictionary:","pat; par. PREP Hence, the user can avoid unnecessary ambiguities by putting frequent words (or conversely, specific terms) in cache dictionarids adapted to each processed text. Most compounds are ambiguous, since they for-really are sequences of simple words; for instance, the sequence pomme de terre is not necessarily a compound noun in the following sentence:","Luc recottvre une pomme de terre tulle","(Luc covetw a cooked potato)","(Luc covers an apple with scorched earth) However, a number of compounds are not ambiguous, either because they contain a non-autonomous conslituent (e.g. aujourd'hui), or because they are technical terms (e.g. tm lube cathodiqtte, un sous-marin nucldaire). By entering these non-ambiguous compounds in a cache dictionary, the user prevents INTEX fi'om looking up dictionaries and FSTs for simple words; hence INTEX does not process these conlpounds as ambiguous. 3.2. Local grammars A local granmaar is a two-part rule: if a given sequence of words is matched, then each word in the sequence is tagged in the proper way. For instance, in the sequence s'en donne, s' is a 1)1\"o-noun (not a conjunction), en is a pronoun (not a preposition), and donne is a verb (not a noun). The corresponding local grammar would be:","s '/<PRO> en/<PRO> <MOT>/< V> <MOT> stands for any word. Local grammars arc represented by FSTs, heuce their length and their COml)lcxity have no limit. Any number of local giammars may be used at lho sanie (line to disanl~ bigualo Ioxls (FSTs Inorgo easily); hence it is best Io el'tale small ()lieS.

The resiill of lhe parshig After having selected linguistic tools (either dictionaries or FSTs), the riser cau parse tile text, that is, insert in the text all the linguistic information reqt, ired by a syntactic parser. For instance, the text: iI la donne would at this step be represented by the following expression: iI, PRO (la, PRO:fr + la, DUl'.'fs) (donne, N:fs + donner, V.'PIs + donner, V:P3s donnel; V: S l s + donne r, V: S3s +donner, V.' Y2s ) la can be a pronoun or a determiner; donne is a noun, or 5 conjugated forms of the verb donner. INTEX then builds the corresponding minimal automaton: the number of transitions of this automaton corresponds to the number of lexical ambiguities of the text (in the above example: 9 transitions). By selecting and applying local grammars to the text, the user effectively removes transitions in the resulting automaton. For instance, thanks to a simple local grammar (which describes the preverbal particles), the above text can be parsed to give the following expression: it, PRO la, PRO:fs (donner, V.'P3s + donner, V:S3s) The remaining ambiguity corresponds to the tense of the verb: indicative or subjunctive present. The corresponding automaton has only 4 transitions. Hence, the number of transitions can be used as a quantitative tool to measure the efficiency of the removal of ambiguities. By selecting one local grammar at a time, or by merging several, the user is able to apprehend exactly how each grammar covers the text, and pcrlbnns in terms of deleting transitions. CONCLUSION INTEX is used for several purposes: --lexicographers who build dictionaries for compounds (or technical terms) try to find new ones by applying characteristic patterns to big corpora, such as: <N> (de + d' + de la + du + des) <N>; --linguists who study specific syntactic structures use INTEX to find attestations of these structures. For instance, one may search for the following structure in order to find predicative nouns associated to the support verbs avob; donnet; Ftre, Jaire:","( <avoir> + <donner> + <~tre > + <fai re >)","(<ADV> + <E>) <N> --our objective is to build a large grammar which covers as much of the language as possible. By applying \"pieces\" of grammar to big corpora, and then studying the outputs, one can correct and refine each piece, and incrementally develop the global grammar; --INTEX is used to find \"semantic units\" in large technical texts, hence it constitutes a good information retrieval system.
