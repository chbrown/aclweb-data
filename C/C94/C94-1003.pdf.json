Step 3 identities extra-exceptional translation patterns by checking the structure of the target part. Step 4 then identifies intra-exceptional ones by comparing the mot node in the target part with the root nodes in the target part of possible general translation patterns. The reason why this comparison is restricted to possible general translation patterns is that intra-excepti(n,d translation patterns have si(h~efrects only when they are similar to general translation patterns.
