S()llle interesting characteristics. First, quantities in the real workl which can be repre sented by degree words w~.ry pragmatically, depending on speakers, situa.tions, etc. (Fauconnier, 1.975). This means that degree words do not have denotations in the rea,1 world. IIowever, lllalty degreL' expressions are used in daily life and it; is not tblt thai, they are particula.rly incomprehensil~le. The authors do not think thaC to underst~md the lneanhtgs of degree words is to understan([ tit(; rea.l quantities in the real world.","Second~ it is difficult to compare: degree words in different languages, in the case of the English non-degree word ~dog, ~ we may think that the word semantically corresponds to the ;lapanese word 'iml' because these two words reli!r to ~he same object 'clog' in the real world. However, this correspondence is not true of degree words. Tim English woM %ften' intuitively corresponds to Lit('. Japanese word %hitmshib% ~ but this correspondence is not ol)vious. 'Fhat is because these words do not have. denota.tions in the real world.","These chttra.cteristics a, re related to the b~vse of Machine Tr~tnslation and its dietionaries. Even when the real quantity, which is reti?rred to by ~t degree word in ~t text, is not clearly understood, it is usually believed that it is possible to translate the word into ~tnother language. When building bi-lingual dictiomtries, it is necessary to consider the correspondence between (lm gree words in each htnguage. A new reference framework is needed by which to investigate to what extent the two words correspond to each other. These issues are. also related to conceptual descriptions in btrge scale knowledge l)aae projects, wlfieh have started recently.","Third, degree words tuwe some ch~racteristics which are indepelMent from in~rts of speech. One of the phenomena degree words have in comnlon is modification restrictions between degree words and rlegree intensi.- tiers. Each degree word ha.s its own modification restriction (Bolinger, 1972; Quirk, 1985; Kamei, 1988, 1990). For example, %IP and qm ~ can be modified by 'Minos(,' but 'tall,' 'short,' hnany~' and 'few' cannot usually be so h~mdled. On the other hand, %all,' %hort,' 'many,' and 'ihw' rail be modified by ~ve.ry,' but 'all' a,nd %0' cannot. 'Some' trod 'sometimes' cannot be modified by either %ery' or ~ahnost.'","Previous researchers pointed out a lot of important linguistic phenonmna~ which ~re related to degree words but, the issues described abow ~. were left uninw~stigated. Barwise trod Cooper (1981) investigate relations I)c~ taween determiners in English and ge,mrMized quantltiers in logic. Howew.'r, they did not focus so much on degree words, such ~s ~tdjeetiw'.s and adverbs in general. it is still undetermined how to fully comprehend such words as 'ma.ny' and % i'ew.' Oazdar (1979) and IIirsehberg (1985) introduced ideas of a linear ordering of degree words and treated ~ wide range of phenomelut related to degree words. However, they directly htmrlled real words and treated ~positive words ~ such as %11' and hnany,' ~nd qmgative words ~ such as flew' and %o ~ separ~ttely. Relations between the positive and negative words were not clear. In order to con,prehend these, unsolwM linguistic phenomena~ the authors propose a semantic model of degree, concepts. 775"]},{"title":"2 Discrete Degree Primitives and a List Expression","paragraphs":["This section introduces discrete degree priinitives and a list expression 'co represent mea.nings of degree concepts.

This suggests the existence of DISCILETE degree concept primitives, which are independent from parts of speech.
