Zernik used monolingual texts which consist of about 1 nfillion words tagged by 1)art-of-spee(:h. I~Iis method associates ca(-h word se.nse of a polysemous woM with a set of its co-occurring words. If a word has sew eral senses, then the word is assoeiated with several different sets of co-occurring words, each of which corresponds to one of the senses of the word. The linfitation of Zernik's method, however, is that it solely relies on human intuition for identifying different senses of a word, i.e. the human editor tlas to determine, by her/his intuition, how many seilses a word has, and then identii~y the sets of co-occurring words"]},{"title":"(signa-t.lcres)","paragraphs":["that correspond to the different senses.","Brown used bilingual texts, which consist of ]2 million words. The results of Brown's technique, when al)- plied to a French-English nmchine transb~tion system, seems to show its eflbctiveness and validity. However, as he admits, the at)preach is linfited because it can only assign at most two senses to a word. More seriously, 1)olysemy is defined in terms of translation, i.e. only when a word is Lranslated into two different words in a target language, it is recogniscd as polysemous. The apllroach can bc used only when a large 1)aral - lel corpus is awdhtble. Furthermore, individual senses thus identified (1(1 not neeessarily constitute single semantic units in the monolingual domain to which 1)lausible semantic prollertics (i.e. semantic rest;rictions, 762 colhlcations, etc.) can lie associated.","The defects of these two methods show that it is crucial to have an N)pr()l)riate detinition of polyscmy in terms of distributimml 1)char|ours of words in monolingual texts.
