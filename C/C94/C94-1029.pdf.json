Nominal forms, such as /kitaab/ 'book', were entered in the lexicon. Vert)al forms were derived by a 'lexicon component'. A verb, such as /nkutib/ (form 7), has the lexical entries n E1 u El i El where El is the alphabet of the root and E~ the alphabet of the vocalism/affixes. Tim lexicon compovent takes the intersection of these two expressions and produces/nkutib/. Now/nkutib/is fed on the lcxical tape of a standard two-level system wtfich takes care of conditional phonetic dmnges (assimilation, deletion, etc.) and produces/'einkutib/, a A similar approach was used by [Lavie et al. 1988] for IIehrew using a 'pre-h!xical compiler'.","[Kay 1987] proposed a finite-state aplnoacl~ using fimr tapes for root, CV-skeleton, vowel melody and surface, each having an indel)endent head, i.e. the machine can scan from one lexical tape without moving the head on other lexieal tapes. The absence of mo-tion is indicated by ad hoc notation coded in the lexical strings.","[Beesley 1991], working on Arabic, impleme,ited a two-level system with 'detours', where, according to [Sproat 1992, p. 163-64], detouring involves nmltiple dictionaries being open at a time, one for roots and one for templates with vowels pre-compiled (as in iIarris' description).","Other non two-level models were proposed (there is no place here for a review of ttmse works): [Kornai 1991] proposed a model for autosegmental l/honology using FSTs, where non-linear autosegmental representations are coded as linear strings. [llird and Ellison 1992] proposed a model llased on one-level phonology using FSA to model representations and rules. [Wiel)e 1992] pr(llmsed I,l(Jdellii,g autosegmental phonology using multi-tal/e FSTs, where mitosegmental representations m'e coded in arrays.","[Puhnan and Hepi)le 1993] prol)osed a formalism for bidirectional segmental phonological processing, and i)roposed using it for Arabic. The next subsection presents the develoi)ment of this formalism. 3.3 Previous Formalisms [Black et al. 1987] pointed out ttmt previous two-level rules (cf. ,~a.1) affect one character at a time and proposed a formalism wtfich maps tletween (equal ram> bered) sequences of surface and lexical characters of the form, SURF ~ LEX alnidal consonant clusters, CC, take a prosthetic /Pi/. A lexical string maps l;o a sllrfaee sLring iff they can be partitioned into pairs of lexical-sm'fi~ce, subsequences, wtmre each pair is licenced I)y a rule. [l].uessink 1989] added explicit contexts and allowed unequal sequences. [Puhnan and IIepple 19931 (level-oiled the l'ormalism further, allowing feature-based representations interpreted via unification.","The developed formalism is llased on the existence of only two levels of rel)resentation: sm'face and lexical.

Once this was estat)lished, we made a second implementation based on the work of [Pulman and Hepple 1993]. This iml)lementation differs fi'om theirs as follows: Lexical expressions are n-tuples, i.e. implemented as lists-of-lists instead of lists-of-characters. A facility to check ellipsis in rules was added. The lexicon consists of multii)le trees, one tree per tape.
