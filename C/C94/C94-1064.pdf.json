To some extent, this connection is already clear since for each parsing strategy the nodes of the parse tree are constructed accord-ing to the corresponding tree traversal. It is somewhat trickier though, to actually use a tree traversa.l program as a parser since the resulting pa.rser may be left recursive. This left recursion can","*The research presented in this paper was partially sponsored by Teilprojekt Bd \"Constraints on Grammar for Efficient Generation\" of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

First, the base case for a parser should be to parse a lexical item rathe,: than to parse an empty string. And second, in the recursive clauses, the mother care.gory fits into the parse tree and is licensed by the auxiliary predicate rule/3 but it does not figure into the string that is parsed.","As was the case for the three tree traversal programs, the three parsers differ from each other only with respect to the right hand side order. ])'or simplicity, I assume that phrase structure rules are binary branching, though the approach can easily be generalized to non-bi uary branching. 1","% top-down parser","td(node(PreTerm,lf(Word))) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}.","td(node(Mother,Left,Right)) --> {rule(Mother,Left,Right)}, gd(Left), td(Right). bottom-up parser","bu(node(PreTerm,lf(Word))) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}.","bu(node(Mother,Left,Right)) --> bu(Left), bu(Right), {rule(Mother,Left,Right)}.","Y, left-corner parser","ic(node(PreTerm,lf (Word))) --> [Word] , {word (Pr eTerm, Word) }.","ic (node (Mother, Left ,Right) ) --> ic(Lef%), {rule (Mother, Left, Right) }, ic (Right).","iks seen here the on]y difference be-tween the t]lree strategies concerns |,he. choice of when to select a phrase structure rule. 2 Do you start with a. rule and then try to satisfy it as iu the top-down apl~roa.ch , or do you parse the (laught(ers of a. rule. first before selecting the rule as in the bottom-up approach, or do you l,al(e an inte,'mediate strategy as in the left-corner al)l)roach.","lq'he only ln'oblematic ease is for left corner since the corresponding tre.e traw~'rsal inorder is normally defined only for bina,'y trees.

There exists, however, a general technique for removal of left-recursion, namely, conversion to Oreibach normal form. The standard Oreibach normal form conversion, however, does not allow for I)CG type rules, but we can easily take care of the Prolog arguments by a technique suggested by Problem 3.118 of Pereira & Shieber [9] to produce what I will call Extended Greibach Normal Form (ECINF). 3 Pereira & Shieber's idea has been more formally presented in the Generalized Greibaeh Normal Form of Dymetman ([1] [2]), however, the simplicity of the parsers here does not justify the extra complication in Dymetman's procedure. Using this transformation, the bottom-up parser then be-comes as follows: 4","aEGNF is similar to normal GNF except that the arguments attached to non-terminals must be manipulated so that the original instantiations are preserved. For specific grammars, it is pretty e~y to see that such a manipulation is possiMe. It is nmch more diftlcult (and beyond the scope of this paper) to show that there is a general rule tbr such manipulations.","4The Greibach NF conversion introduces one auxiliary predicate, which (following IIopcroft & Ulhnan [4]) I have called b. Of course, the GNF conversion also does not tell us what to do with the auxiliary procedures in curly brackets. What I've done here is silnply to put these auxiliary procedures in the transformed grammar in positions corresponding to where they occurred in the original grammar. It's not clear that one can always find such a \"corresponding\" position, though in the case of the bottom-up and left-corner parsers such a position is easy to identify.","% EGNF bottom-up","bu(node(PreTerm,lf(Word))) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}.","bu(Node) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}. b(node(PreTerm,lf(Word)),Node).","b(L,node(Mother,L,R)) --> bu(R), {rule(gother,L,R)}.","b(L,Node) --> bu(R), {rule(Mother,L,g)}, b(node(Mother,L,R),Node).","This, however is not very ef[icient since the two clauses of both bu and b differ only in whether or not there is a final call to b. ~Ve can reduce l.he a.mount of backtracking by encod-ing this optiolmlity in the b procedure itself.","% Improved EGNF bottom-up","bu(Node) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}, b(node(PreTerm,lf(Word)),Node). b(Node,Node) --> []. b(L,Node) -->"]},{"title":"bu(R),","paragraphs":["{rule(Mother,L,R)}, b(node(Mother,L,R),Node).","l~y tile same I\",GNI: transform~Ltion and improvement, s, tile resulting left-corner parser is only minimally different from the bottom-up parser: Improved EGNF Left-corner","Ic(Node) --> [Word], {word(PreTerm,Word)}, b(node(PreTerm,lf(Word)),Node). 398 b(Node,Node) --> []. b(L,Node) -->","{rule(Mother,L,g)},"]},{"title":"Xc(R), b(node(Hother,L,R),Node). 4 PARTIAL EXECUTION The","paragraphs":["improved ECNF bottom-np altd left-corner parsers (lilIhr now only in the position of the auxiliary l)redicate in curly brackets.
