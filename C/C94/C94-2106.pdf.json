Introduction","paragraphs":["Various machine translation systems have approached the stage of being put to practical use. However, the quality of the finished translation is not satisfactory in any of these systems. This is due to difficulties in limiting linguistic phenomena that are handled by machine translation systems. In particular, the analysis of linguistic expressions such as ellipsis and anaphoric references, which require contextual analysis, is imperfect. To introduce constraints brought about by context requires an enormous volume of knowledge of word meanings that can be used to determine the semantic relationships between one sentence and another.","To avoid an explosion in the volume of knowledge, a technique is proposed for classifying word meanings and determining the relationships between words or between sentences using the typical attribute values of each word. Particularly in the case of context processing, the verbal semantic attributes that become the key factors in analyzing the flow of sentences constitute important knowledge.","Various efforts have been made in researching verb classification. Muraki (1985) suggested a method for grouping Japanese verbs using their word meanings and their syntactic features. Tomiura et al. (1986) proposed a method for representing the meaning of verbs divided into fundamental meanings and reasoning rules. Ogino et al. (1989; EDR 1990) proposed a method for verb classification based on relations between verbs and co-occurring elements. Various efforts have been made to classify English verbs. For example, Levin (1993) proposed a method for the classification of 3000 English verbs that uses the relationship between syntactic behavior and shared meaning.","The research about verb classification still tends to be limited solely to classification of the semantics of verbs per se. It does not take into account the relationship between word meanings and their usage within sentences and is not aimed at natural language processing. Thus, the full benefits that could be achieved in the analysis of tracking semantic relationships between sentences and eliminating the polyscmy of verbs have not been realized.","This paper tbcusses on the relationship between word meanings of verbs and their usage, and seeks to classify the semantic attributes of verbs. These semantic attributes are used in defining the method of use of each verb in Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionaries. They furnish the key to tracing the semantic relationships of verbs that are used in a text."]},{"title":"2. Semantic Structure of Verbal Patterns","paragraphs":["This chapter examines the relationship between the usage of verbs I and the semantic structure of verbs. In machine translation systems, it is well known that the translation pattern pairs of source IALT-J/E's pattern dictionaries include both verbs and adjectives. Japanese adjectives are the equivalent of English 'be Adjective': for example \"A-ga utsukushii\" => \"A is beautiful\". 'verbs' will be used to refer to both verbs and adjectives from now on. 672 hmguage and target language sentence are effective in detmrnining the meaning of verbs.","Our machine translation system, AI,T-J/E, uses two types of Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionaries based on verbs: the semantic valence pattern transfer dictionary and the idiomatic expression transfer dictionary (Fig. 1). These dictionaries consist of pairs made of [The semantic valence Imttern transfer d ictimmryl (1) NI(SUBJECI'S)-ga N2(F(X)D)-wo taheru","eat => N1 eatt N2 (2) Nl(*)-ga yomigaeru","revive :> NI revive [The idiomatic expression transfer dictionary l (1) NI(sUBJECTS)-ha se-ga takai","back high => NI is tall. Fig. 1 Japanese to English Transfer Pattern","Dictionaries (The semantic constraints are shown in parenthesis, * indicates flmre is no senmntic constraint.) Japanese unit sentence patterns derived from Japanese verbs 2 with semantic constraints to their case elements and English patterns which correspond to thc Japanese expressions, t\"or example, pattern(l) in Fig. 1 shows how, if the Japanese verb is \"taberu\" and the noun phrase with a \"ga\" particle, which shows a subject, has the semantic attribute SUBJECTS and the noun phrase with a \"we\" particle, which shows a direct object, has the setnantic attribute FOOl) then the verb should be translated as \"eat\". The noun phrase with the \"ga\" particle is translated as the English subject. The noun phrase with the \"we\" particle is translated as the English direct object. Here, wc exantine the rehttionship between the usage of verbs and the semantic structure of verbs using verbal patterns that have been entered into the Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionaries of ALT-J/IL","Fig. 2 shows an example of entries in the Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionary which indicate the patterns of the 2In the idiomatic expression transfer dictionzu'ies, these arc the core secg)r of idiomatic exp,essions such as \"Abura we uru\" literally, \"to sell oil\", but kliomatically, \"to idle away time\". Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\". This verb has three patterns.","[Japanese Verb : tsutsumu \"wrap\"l","(l) NI(SUBJECTS)-ga N2(CONCRETE OBJECTS or PEOPLE)-wo N3(CLOTHES or PAPERS)-de IsuIsumu","=> N1 wrap N2 in/withN3","Verbal Semantic Attribute: NI's bodily action","(2) NI(FIRE, ATMOSI'tlERI~ or AlR)-ga N2(CONCRETE OBJECTS, CULTtJRE or PLACES)-wo Isulsumu","=> Ni envelop N2","Verbal Semantic Attribute: N1 clmnges N2's attributes","(3)NI(FOG)-ga N2(CONCRETE OBJECTS or PI,ACES)-wo ISI~tsIImu","=> NI veil N2","Verbal Semanlic Attribute: Natural Plmnomena Fig. 2 Example of a Japanese Verb with","multiple patterns","The first example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equiwtlent of the Japanese expression \"N 1 (SUBJECTS) ga N2 (CONCRETE OBJECTS or PEOPI,E) we N3(CLOTHtiS or I'APERS) de tsutsumu\" is the English expression \"N1 wrap N2 in/with N3\". When the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\" was used with these cases, this sentence gives the impression that NI really does the wrapping action. So, in this case, this pattern has the w:rb meaning \"N1 conducts bcxlily action.\".","The second example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equivalent expression of the Japanese expression \"NI (FIRE, ATMOSPIIERE or AIR) ga N2(CONCRETE OBJECTS, CULTtlRE or PLACES) we laulsumu\" is the English expression \"NI envelop N2\". This sentence gives the impression that the state of N2 which isn't usually enveloped by N1 changes to the enveloped state. So, even though the same Japanese verb \"ISUL~'UmU\" was used with these cases, in this case, the pattern has a verb meaning of \"NI changes N2's attributes.\".","The third example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equiwdent of the Japanese expression \"N 1 (FOG) g(l N 2(C()NCRETF~ OBJECI'S or PLACES)we tsutxumu\" is the English expression \"N1 veil N2\". In this case, this sentence gives the impression that a natural 6Z3 phenomenon, 'fog', has occurred. So, this pattern has the meaning \"Natural Phenomena have arisen\".","As shown in these examples, maintaining expressions in pairs which indicate both the common meaning and their usage between the Japanese and English, enables us to eliminate many conceptual ambiguities and makes it possible to give detailed and accurate attribute values to the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\".","As in the case of the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\", one verb normally has several kinds of conceptual structures. But one verbal pattern which indicates common word meanings and their use between the Japanese and English (which differ so vastly in syntactic structure) corresponds to one conceptual structure. So, it is possible to eliminate the conceptual ambiguity of verbs by selecting verbal patterns in syntactic semantic analysis. In Japanese to English machine translation, we estimate there are tens of thousands of verbal patterns which need to be defined. If the usage of these patterns can be expressed by a small number of verbal semantic attributes, it is possible to track the semantic relationships of verbs easily. When giving verbal semantic attributes to a pair of individual Japanese and English patterns, it is possible to refer to the meaning of verbs not only in Japanese but also in English. 3. System of Verbal Semantic Attributes 3.1 Classification Standards for","Verbal Semantic Attributes Regarding the classification of verbs for use in machine translation, Nishida et al. (1980) proposed a system of verbal classification. This system of classification was introduced to resolve syntactic and semantic ambiguities of English in English to Japanese machine translation. To this system, they added the semantic attributes of verbs to the patterns of English verbs proposed by Hornby (1975) and determined the case structures depending on the combination of these two kinds of information. This system of verbal semantic attributes was introduced on the condition that the features of syntactic structures are expressed by Hornby's patterns of English verbs. So, this system of classification focused only on word meaning. Therefore this system can not be applied as such to the classification of Japanese verbs because Hornby's patterns can't be applied directly to Japanese verbs. No one has yet to propose exhaustive patterns like Hornby's for Japanese verbs.","We expanded our system based on the discussions in section 2, using the following two factors. • Dynamic Characteristics of verbs","Classification based on a verb's meaning","and its effects on the discourse: This classification is based on the types of action that can be understc×)d to have occurred when a verb is expressed and what situations have been brought about.","Ex. \"motsu\"(to have) -- Possession \"kaihatsusuru\"(to develop) -- Production","The verb \"motsu\" indicates that there is an act of possession within the context. In contrast, the verb \"kaihatsusuru\" indicates that there is something being produced within the context. • Relationslfip of Verbs to Cases","Classification based on the role which the","cases play with the verbs that govern them: This classification is based on the roles played by the case elements governed by the verb expressed.","Ex.\"kanseisuru\":SUBJ be completed","->SUBJ be produced","\"kaihatsusuru\":SUBJ develop OBJ","->SUBJ produce OBJ","\"kanseisuru\" and \"kaihatsusuru\" \"are both verbs which indicate acts of production. But whereas \"kanseisuru\" indicates that the SUBJ is being produced, \"kaihatsusuru\" indicates that the SUBJ produces the OBJ.","3.2 Semantic Attribute System considering the Semantic Relationship between Verbs We created a system of verbal semantic attributes as explained above. The semantic attribute values were determined using the usage patterns of typical Japanese verbs. First we classified verbs focussing on their dynamic characteristics. Next, we classified each group again focussing on the relationships of verbs to 674 their cases. The top levels of the created system of verbal semantic attributes are shown in Fig. 3. The left side of this figure lists classifications as based on the dynamic characteristics of the verbs (their meanings). The right side lists the classifications based on the relationship of verbs with their cases (their usage). On the basis of these classification criteria, 97 verbal semantic attributes have been established.

Applications","paragraphs":["for Context Processing in this chapter, we show examples of applications in context processing."]},{"title":"5.1 Analysis of","paragraphs":["Anaphoric Reference"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["Japanese Zero Pronouns Using verbal semantic attributes to analyze anaphoric referents of zero pronouns appearing in Japanese texts is one applicati(m that has been considered (Nakaiwa et al. 1992). This technique pays attention to verbal semantic attributes and the relationship between the semantic attributes of tim verbs which govern zero pronouns and the semantic attributes of ttle verbs which govern case element candidates which may be anaphoricatly referred to. The contexts are carefully examined to determine anaphoric reference elements.","This method has been realized in the machine translation systmn AIA'-J/E. The enhanced ALTJ/E was assessed by processing common Japanese newspaper articles. It was found that 95% of the Japanesc zero pronouns requiring anaphoral resolution in the 102 sentences from 30 newspapcr articles' lead paragraphs tlad their referents determined correctly using rules tuned for the 102 sentences(window test). In tile case of a blind test, the rate of success in anaphora resolution in which the zero pronoun referent exists within the sentence in another 98 sentences from newspaper articles was about 83% using tile rules. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we evaluated the performance of the method proposed by Walker et.al. (1990) using the 98 sentences. Its rate of success in anaphora resolution where the zero pronoun referents existed within the sentence was about 74%. This result shows that our method is more effective than Walker's method, and that the rules used in our method determine universal relationships between verbs. If a few rules appropriate ff)r tile 98 sentences are added, tile rate increases to 95%. This result shows that the load imposed by rule customization is low.","Even in the case of sentences in machine translation systems for which target meas cannot be constrained, this method allows the construction of rules independent of the translation target areas by means of verbal semantic attribute pairings. Using the verbal semantic attributes, anaphoric reference resolution of zero pronouns can be conducted with a limited volume of knowledge."]},{"title":"5.2 Supplementation of","paragraphs":["Elements Outside Sentences against Elliptical Case Elements Verbal semantic attributes can be used with elliptical case elelnents in Japanese texts to supplement case elements whose referents do not appear within tim texts. To analyze such elliptical phenomena, it is possible to use case elements' semantic constraint conditions to estimate supplementary elements. Semantic information used to estimate supplementing elelnents is a constraint on cases for selecting the transfer f)attcrn. With this xnethod, therelbre, the majority of the constraints involve abstract semantic information, fi'equently posing difficulties in pinpointing elements to be supplemented.

Thus if a method presuming supplementary elements of elliptical 677 case elements corresponding to the verbal semantic attributes is used, the deduction of more accurate supplementary elements would be possible. 5.3 Application for Other Context Processings The verbal semantic attributes can be applied to other context processing problems. Estimating the relationship between verbs by pairing of the verbal semantic attributes, analysis of the tenses relationship of events as indicated by certain sentences and events indicated by another, together with sentence abridgment can be considered."]},{"title":"6.
