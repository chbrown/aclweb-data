Using statistics and crude surface analysis and a minimum of prior information, Dihnn,,,a identities instances and suggests their counterparts in I)aralh!l source and target texts, on all levels down to individual words.","Dilemma forms part of a tool kit for t,'anslation where focus is on text structure and over-all consistency in large text volumes rather than on framing sentences, on interaction between many actors in a large project rather than on retriewd of machine-stored data and on decision making rather than on application of give,) rules.","In particular, the system has been tuned to the needs of the ongoing translation of European Con,n,unity legislation into the languages of candidate me,,,her countries. '/'he system has been demonstrated to and used by professional translators with promising results. Instant Lexicographer The design of translation aids beyond ordinary texl. processing and database accession and maintenance tools is mostly based on the same sinai)lifted view which .... for compelling reasons -- has been the worki,,g hyl>othesis of machine translation: that the source text. has a well-determined meaning and that there exists in the target language at least one correct and adequate ways of expressing that meaning.","When these assumptions are reasonably well justifled, translation is relatively easy, fast and cheap with traditional methods and mechanization not rarely feasible with methods now known or envisaged. Typically, however, the translator must do more tha.n retrieve and operate on we-established a,,d in principle pre-storable correspondences. Thus, lexical correspondences do not exist for all items; it is an essential part of translation to establish them. Legal texts, factual and stereotype though they may see,n, re.gularly represent thoughts, attitudes and arguments which do not haw'. any counterparts in the. target language prior to translation. This is particulary true in the huge project to translate the European Community legislation into the languages of countries which are not yet members of tile (]omnmnity and which currently have a partly different legal conceptual framework.","What human translators need is decision supl)ort. The most imlmrtant tools are telelfl,ones , electronical ¢'onfi.'rencing systems and good and relevant dictiol,aries. Unfortunately, there are not always at ew~'ry point of time ltnowledgalAe and cooperative colleagues or othe.r experts to call, eh.'ctronical networks ~tre only recently being established in some domMns, and the intelligent and comprehensive dictionaries, which can serve as a writer's digest to the cumulative literature it, a fiehl are few and far between.
