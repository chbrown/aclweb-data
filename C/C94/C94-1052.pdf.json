Within Acquilex IP Project, a unification framework based on typed feature structures [4] was ddveloped, the LKB (Lexical Knowledge Base), in order to represent conceptual units corresponding to lexieal senses, lexical and phrasal rules, multilingual rclalionships, elc. This paper describes the enhancements made, to the LKB system [6], in order to support linking of lexical entries to their translation equivalents. The organisation of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the motivations and formalisation of tlinks (for \"translation links\"). Section 3 deals with TGE (Tlinks Generation Environment), the way we propose to help in constructing lexical linkages semi-automatically from LKB data and bilingual dictionaries [13], [8], loaded in the LDR (Lexical Data Base) environment [5]. Section 4 shows the use of'l'GE 1 This researcher has been snported by a grant o.f the Departament d'Ensenyament (~]'Generalitat de Catahmya. 91-DOCG-1491. 2 This researcher has been snported by o grant o/\" the Ministerio tie Educacidn y Ciencia. 92.BOF. 16392. 3 AcquilexH EC Esprit project BRA 7315. within SEISD 4 [1] (Sistema de extracci6n de Informacidn Sem~ntica de Diccionarios). In section 5 some experimental results ,are presented. Finally in section 6 we present our conclusions ,and furtl~er lines of research. 2 Tlinks The initial assumption was that the basic units for defining lexical translation equivalence should be the lexical entries in the monolingual LKBs, which should, in general, correspond to word senses in the dictionary. Although in the simplest cases we c,'m consider the lexical entries themselves as translation equiv,-dent, in general more complex cases occur corresponding to lexical gaps, differences in morphologic or lexical features, specificity, etc. [11]. We will therefore represent the relationships between words in terms of tlinks. The tlink mechanism is general enough to allow the monolingual information to be augmented with translation specific information, in a variety of ways. We will first describe the tlink mechanism in the LKB and then outline how some of these more complex equivalences can be represented. The LKB formalism uses a typed feature structure (FS) system for representing lexical knowledge. So we can define tlinks in terms of relations between FSs. Lexical (or phrasal) transformatious in both source and target languages ~ are a desirable capability so that we can state that a tlink is essentially a relationship between two rules (of the sort already defined in the LKB) where the rule inputs have been instantiated by the representations of the word senses to be linked. As shown in fig 1, furniture can be encoded as translation equivalent to the plural muebles by specifying that the named rule plural has to be applied to the base sense in Spanish. As any other LKB object a tlink can be represented as a feature structure, as shown in fig 2. The type system mechanism, in the LKB, allows further 4SEISD is an interactive environment built within Acquilex project in order to help in constructing the LKB entries from the LDB sources. 5 in fact tlinks are undirected relations. 324"]},{"title":"identity <fs0:l> <fs0:0> furniture furniture tlink plural <fsl:0> <fsl:l> muebles mueble","paragraphs":["Figt~re 1: A tlink #etween furnit,tre anti muebles."]},{"title":"fl","paragraphs":["~ tlink (top) < fsO > = rule <fsl>=rule < fs0:0 : sere : id > = < fsl : 0 : sem : id >.","simple-flink (tlink) partial-tlink (simple-tlink) <fs0:0>=<fs0:l > <fsl :0:rqs > = < fs0:O:rqs>. < fsl:0> =< fsl :1 >."]},{"title":",op ]","paragraphs":["I rule <0> = sign <1> = sign. ,,,","plmksal41ink (tlink) < fsI > = grammar-rule.

A simple-tlink is applicable whenever two lexical entries which denote single place predicates (nouns, etc.) arEstraighfforwardly an equivalent translation, without any previous transformation. Thus, assuming that the LDOCE [9] sense absinth L 0 1 is translatio,l equivalent to the VOX [12] sense absenta X I 1, we will have tile next tlink: simple tlink <fs0:1 >==absinth L_0_I <fst : 1 >~absenta X I 1. The \"syntactically sug~tred\" version, which appears in tlink files, is: absinth L 0 1 / absenta X t 1 : simple-tlink. A partial tlink is applicable when we want to transfer the quidia structure from one sense to anc)ther, and a phrasal tlink is necessary when we need to describe a single word equivalent translation to a phrase [I0]."]},{"title":"3 TGE: Tlinks Generation Environment","paragraphs":["The establisment of tlinks can be obviously perlbrmed manually, but the multiplicity of possible cases and the existence of several Knowledge St)nrces (such as bilingual dictionaries, monolingt,al LDBs, or a mtddlingual [.KB) allows and motivates the (parlizd) antomalizalion of the process. To help in perl'orn~ing such a task wc have developed an interactive environment: T(;I.]. TGE has been implemented using a Production Rules approach. This approach was already used within the SEISD enviromnent ,'rod was mainly motivated by the need of providing a flexible and open way of defining tlink formation mechanisms. The core of TGE is PRE (production rules Environment), a rnle-orieuted general purpose interpreter [2]. PPd~ follows the philosophy of most Production Rules Systems [3] but is deeply adapted to Natural Language applications. PRE offers a powerful (according to both expressiveness and performance) rule applicatio,I mecljanism and provides the possibilities of defining higher level mechanisms, such as rulescts (allowing inheritance capabilities) ,and of choice ,'unong control strategies, either usEr-definEd or provided by the system. Consider the following example: (rule rule-l-all ruleset all control forever priority l (translation-in \"trans-records (?translation *rest)) -> (modify 1 \"trans-records (*rest)) (create a'anslation","t̂rans-psorts nil","t̂rans-record ?translation","t̂link-type nil ĉhecked nil)) In this rule the pattern-condition is the occurrence of an object named translation-in ill the Working Memory. This object must ill tUrn contain a t̂rans-records attribute whose value will be matched against file pattern (?translation *rest). If the matching succeeds then .:/2.5 translation will be unified with the first element of tile list and rest with the remainder elements. The action part of the rule consists of two actions. The t'ormer is the modification of translation-in, popping its first element, and the latter performs the creation of another object, named translation. Rule-l-all rule is applied until all the objects n,-uned \"translation-in\" have emptied the list contained in their slot \"trans-records. 4 Using TGE for generating Tlinks The TGE may be considered a toolbox attd thus, it doesn't impose a fixed methodological strategy. Whatever methodology we follow, several decisions must be taken: the kind of control we need, the rulesets to be designed, \"the rules belonging to each ruleset, the relative priority assigned to each rule ,and so on. As regards the control strategy, one of tile following four alternatives may be chosen lbr each source entry (see [2] of [10] for futher details): • All, which executes all tile rulesets. From tile proposed Oinks, finally the user chooses the correct ones. • Collect, which executes the rulesets one at a time and provides the results to the user (for selection of the correct ones) every time a ruleset succeeds. • One-by-one, which orderly executes the rulesets ,and stops as soon as one of them succeeds. • Select, which only executes the rulcsets that the user chooses. An initial set of modules was designed according to tile typology of tlinks presented so far. It included four sorts of Oinks that showed distinct conceptual correspondences between both languages. A more in-depth study of English-Spanish mismatcfies [11] might lead to an enrichment of the typology, and co,lsequeully to a need Ibr extending the extant modules."]},{"title":"Up","paragraphs":["tO now seven modules, each one iln[}lumeulcd ,'is a ruleset, have been developed. Fach of them generates one out of/he three kinds of tlinks stated above. Each module follows a different strategy to guess a possible tlink, taking account of the lhree accessible knowledge sources. • Simple Tlink Module, this is tile case when there exists a direct translation of the source entry in the bilinguN dictionary. Ex,'unple: absenta x i 1 -->absenta LKB source entry absenta --> absinth bilingual dictionary absinth --> absinth L_0 I l.KBtargctcntry absenta x_i_I / absinth I. 0_1: SIMPt.E-qq-INK. \"absenta\" is translated in the bilingual dictionary by \"absinth\", ABSINTH L_0 1 is a valid lexical entry of the target lexicon, and therefore a SIMPLE-TLINK connecting both entries is created. • Orthographic Tlink Module, this case occurs when in both languages the same word with exactly the same spelling is used. Therelbre, no bilingual dictionary is needed. • Compound Tlink Module, this is the case when the corresponding entry in the target lexicon is a compound one, being the target lexio'd entry made up of the concatenation of the two English words that appear in the bilingual entry. • Phrasal Noun Tlink Module, this case takes place whenever the translation is the concatenation of two other nouns; for example, the Spanish nouns for trees often correspond.to two nouns in English, (like limonero - lemon tree, melocotonero - peach tree, etc.). More complex cases can be recovered by using different grammar rules (also implemented within the LKB formalism). • Parent Tlink Module, this is the case of those very specific terms in the source lexicon which are not treated in the bilingual dictionary, but whose hypcronyms in the taxonomy have a clear translation that can generate a partial tlink. • Grandparent Tlink Module, this is a very similar case to the previous one, in which the source word's grandpm-ent is used to produce the partial tlink. • General Tlink Module, this is the case when the translation appearing in the bilingual dictionary is composed of more than one word. Normally these explanations are made up as definitions in the form of a genus, plus some modifiers. A tlink connecting the source entry and the genus appearing in the definition must be crcaied. We will illustrate the tlink generation process with an example of an entry for which a number of different dinks have been generated, namely batido X I 5. In figure 3 where batido_XI5 appears with the tlink options, we had selected file option all and subsequently, all tile possible tlinks have been suggested by the system. Ilowever the TGE allows for other selection criteria. As we can see iu figure 3, five tlinks are suggested by tile system for this p~ticular example: I) The first option is not a correct one. Among tile various translations given for the source LKB entry batidoX_15 the adjective shot appears. Because another syntactic realisation of shot is that of a noun denoting a drinkable thing therefore it is included ill the t,'uget subset. 326","r ~ File Edit Find Windows Packages fools Preferences Ldb Lk.b pro","•","i","........... \"llinks selection mode fiLL for gflTIDO_H_l_5 SIlOf_L_l_l 3 SII'4PLE-EL INK SIMPLE b41LK_SIIFIKE .... ~IN1PL.E-/LINK COMPOUND HILK_L_I_I +,,.

We discuss next thosc con'esl~mding It} \"drinks\" [I0]. The Spanish taxouomy of (lrink-n(mns, cxu'acted from VOX dictionary, consists of 235 noun senses atnd h:ls 5 levels. The English taxonomy of drit|k-nouns, exlracted from LDOCE, consists at' 192 notre senses. Some of the obtained results are the following: • While translating f,'om Slmnish to l~lI,jlish, 223 out of 235 drink-nouns have been linked by means of different aud often more than one tlinks (95 %). However, only 52 English nouns have been linked with Spanish nouns (27%). Out of these 223 drink-nouns mentioned above, 210 have been linked by using (mainly) the bilingu:d dictionary as a translation resource while the rest, 13 of them, have been linked by means of the orthographic-tlink ruleset and consequently, the gap of the bilingual dictionary has finally been bridged, for in both hntguages the stone word with exactly the same spelling is used. For example, chartreuse X l 1 aud chartrettse_.L_l O, sherry Xll mid sherry L 0_0, etc. • 74 out of 235 source I+KB entries for drink-nouns are also bilingual entries (31,5%). Consequently, 161 source I+KB entries have no corresponding bilingual entries (68,5%). This big gap in the bilingual dictionary is due to the [act that the one nsed, VOX/llarrap's, is a very basic one, and as such it only contains 32,463 senses, lu contrast the VOX monolingual Spanish dictionary covers a total of 143,700 senses. • 30 out of tilt translations of tilt 74 source I+KI] entries which were found in the bilingual dictionary are also tm'get I+KB entries. Consequently, the translations of 44 bilingual entries have uo corresponding target I+KB entries. • 13 out of 16l source LKB entries arc also target LKB 327 entries (8 %). • For most entries, more than one tlink type has been extracted.
