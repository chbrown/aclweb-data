Complex lexical units are mainly compounds, commonly characterized by a set of morphosyntactic and semantic criteria (see for example [llenveniste, 1966] for Dench and [tlatcher, 1960] for English). The constitution of a list of technical terms from a specific domain is an important issue in NaturM Language Processing, for example in applications such as Machine Translation. Several methods for the extraction of terms have been proposed, relying on linguistic or statistical approaches. To build a monolingual terminology bank, [Bourigault, 1{)92] has implemented a software package which provides it list of likely terminologicM units, based on linguistic specifications. Different statistical methods have Mso been tested to extract collocations from large corpora, as [Church and lianks, 1990, Smadja aim McKeown, 1990]. Our work makes use of both linguistic and statistical knowledge. The outline of this paper is the following: lirst, given linguistic specifh:ations of English and l;'rencli terms, we select noun phrases which are likely ta be terms, and which we will call candidate terms. To build a monolingual terminology bank, we then apply different statistical scores to select the good ones among the candidate terms. Finally, we. test statistical inethods to obtMn ;~ list of bilingual terms, using aligned corpora in l\"cench and Ex@ish. All work and tests are carried out on a parallel bilingual corpus that is tagged by the words' part-of-speech and lemma. This corpus consists of Mmut 20(I,000 words for each language in the tieht of telecommunications. Simil,~r work can be found in [Van der Eijk, 1993]."]},{"title":"2 Linguistic specifications of French and English terms 2.1 Basic multi-words units","paragraphs":["From an investigation of the cori)us, and from the tenninologists' point of view (for exampie [Nkwenti-Azeh, 1992]), it appears that most of tile terms encountered in technical tiehls are noun phrases corresponding to ~t limited num-I}er of syntactic patterns. These patterns detine the morphosyntactic structures of multi-words units (MWU) which are likely to be terms. We detine the length of a MWU as the number of main items it contains. A main item is either a noun, an adjective, a verb or an adverb; thus, neither deternliners nor prepositions are considered main items. MWU of length 1 often correspond to words connected with a hyphen or an apostrophe, and are easy to identify. We will not deal with them in this paper. Nor are we concerned with mono-word terms (e.g. telematics), the extraction of which is a different -possibly 515 516 snore complex- problem. We present below the patterns retained for MWU of length 2, which we will refer to as base MWU. For each pattern we give an example followed by its translation in parentheses.

In order to l)uild the reference list, we augmented an existing terminology database (EURODICAUTOM) with hand work: we selected those candidates for which at least two judges out of three agreed on their goodness, and included them in the reference llst. A candidate will be considered \"good\" when it is found in this reference list.","The program for the extraction of candidates was run on a 240,000 words French corpus, divided into 9,541 sentences. It yiehled 2,400 candidates that appear at least three times in the text. After sorting the candidates according to the particular score examined, we build a graphic representation of the prol)ortion of \"good\" candidates per range of score w~lues, in the form of a histogram. Figure 1 shows the histograms obtMned on the French Iqt de 1~2 candidates with two different scores: the likelihood ratio and mutuM information. The vertical axis, which represents the proportion of good candio dates, is bounded between 0 and 1. llut, since we do not pretend to have built an exhaustive reference list, we can't actually expect values of more than 0.8. The horizontM axis grows with the score. The likelihood ratio test (LOG) (the use of a likelihood ratio test leads to a log likelihood statistics, which explains tile LOG abbrevi:ttion) shows a curve that grows slowly at tirst, and then decidedly. There is a true ol)position ill the behaviours of small and big v~Llues, the representativity of good candidates approaching 0.8 in that case. On tile contrary, mutual informat, ion (MI)is quite uniformeiy distributed, and the representativity never exceeds 0.5. Thus, if one had to choose between these two scores, the first one would undoubtedly be selected.","The outcome of tile study of tile histograms is that very few searing methods will meet our objective. The most signilicant seem to be tit('. likelihood ratio test, and the number of occur-fences of the pair. If it were for the sole histograms, one could be tempted to keep only the frequency of the pair, but due to its definition unfrequent terms won't stand out; therefore, we have to keep several methods. Anyhow, the performance of our scoring functions indicate tile best method to follow: start any task (human post-editing for example) with the highest frequency values on monolingual candidates previously identified via linguistic patterns, thus maximizing the odds that the candidates will indeed be \"good\" candidates.","Is the best score a combination of s(:ores? An extra data analysis method","To complete the evaluation and comparison of the different scores used to select actual ternls from our candidates list, we have applied to these scores specific data analysis methods. In our case, tile techniques of data anMysis can provide at least two things: a probabillstic study of the correlations between scores, in order to select tile relevant ones, and the possibility of coml)ining scores, in order to improve the results.","We carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a set of fifteen variables, i.e. tile scores, on a set of"]},{"title":"1,230","paragraphs":["individuals, i.e. the can-517"]},{"title":"0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.2 0.1 0 t ....","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Itistograms corresponding to the log likelihood (left), and to mntnal information (right) didates. The first objective of PCA is to reduce the number of variables with as little loss of information as possible. Doing so shouhl enable us to visualize our data more easily. From the study of the correlation matrix of variables and their part in the principal axis, it appeared that variables could be divided into four classes. In each class, we wanted to retain the most significant variable with regard to our task. This was done by selecting in each class the variable with the best score-histogram. All other w~riables can be confidently connected to one of these.","With the remaining four variables we tried to investigate the set of candidates. The difficulty of this task comes from the high nulnber of candidates, so we decided to work on smaller sets. We divided the whole set of candidates into six subsets depending on the number of occurrences of the candidate (respectively with a number of occurrences in the text equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, between 6 and 10, and over 10). This division was used to counterbalance the fact that most scores tend to privilege low frequencies. We then visualized the candidates graphically (with different tick marks distinguishing terms and non-terms) on several two-dimensional diagrams, the axis of which are linear combinations of the different variables. The results show series of marks overlapping each other, without any clear separation between terms and non-terms.","The PCA allowed us to go further in the study of the statistical scores, and confirmed that only a few are relevant to our task; more-over, we found no satisfactory combination of variables that could account for termhood."]},{"title":"4 Bilingual candidate term alignment","paragraphs":["The problenl is now one of finding correspondences between candidates across languages (between English and I\"rench in our case). As it has been shown in the previous section, it is difllcult to restrict the set of candidates to the \"good\" ones. l'~urthermore, if a candidate is really a term, it shouht be easy to find the equivalent in other languages, or more precisely, in our case, in aligned sentences (supposing that terms are always translated into the same lexical unit). For these reasons, we tried to pick out associations between the whole sets of candidates, both l?rench and English. Sticking to our general philosophy of harmonizing linguistic and statistical contributions, we made experiments with two methods.","4.1 A simple count method, and a possible improvement","This method basically counts how often a source candidate and a target candidate occur in aligned sentences; we shall cMl the resulting score bilingual count. For a given source language candidate, the most frequently aligned target candidates are sorted according to the score; one can then apply the criterion defined in [Gaussier et al., 1992], which consists in extracting a bilingual pair only when the target candidate has no stronger association with any other source candidate. Such a naive frequency collection gives satisfactory results, providing a sorted list where the top half candidates are 518 mostly good. We can however try to improve on that result by taking adv,'tntage of available linguistic inforIffation, namely the part-of-speech patterns of the candidates.

For each unit, we calcula.ted its recall a.nd its precision. The scores can then be compared in graphs showing the evolution of precision and recall with the number of candidates considered. Using such graphs, we found out that adding pattern probabilities gives only slightly better or equal results than the silnple frequency method, which does not entirely satisfy our expectations as to their role on the quality of term alignment.","The second method presented above, which does not make use of pattern probabilities, be-haves better for candidates of rank 1,00(} and more, hut worse for the first 100 best candidates.

The simple frequency count of the pair turns out to be the best score. We then carried out bilingual terminology extraction using results from the nmnolingum step. Two scoring methods augmented by the use of prior knowledge about the bilingual correspondences of linguistic patterns were applied to bilingual pairs of monolingua[ candidate pairs. In this case, the best way to proceed is derived from the combination of the two methods.","With regard to the future, we will focus on monolingual extraction of MWU of length a and more (based on the identified base MWU and linguistic specifications on term composition), and on the improvement of term alignment in order to deal with terms of heterogeneous length."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Benveniste, 1966] Benveniste B."]},{"title":"(1966).","paragraphs":["Formes nouvelles de l~t composition nominale.
