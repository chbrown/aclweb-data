We combine a rule-based analysis with subsequent exploitation of empirical data. The rule~based surface syntactic analyser leaves some amount of ambiguity in the output that is resolved using empirical patterns. We have implemented a system for generating and applying corpus-based patterns. Somc patterns describe the main constituents in the sentence and some the local context of the each syntactic function. There are several (partly) redmltant patterns, and the \"pattern\" parser selects analysis of the sentence ttmt matches the strictest possible pattern(s). The system is applied to an experimeutal corpus. We present the results and discuss possible refinements of the method from a linguistic point of view.","1 INTRODUCTION We discuss surface-syntactic analysis of running text. Our purpose is to mark each word with a syntactic tag. The tags denote subjects, object, main verbs, adverbials, etc. They are listed in Appendix A. Our method is roughly following • Assign to each word all the possible syntactic tags. • Disambiguate words as much as possible using linguistic information (hand-coded rules). Ilere we avoid risks; we rather leave words ambiguous than guess wrong. • Use global patterns to form alternative sentence level readings. Those alternatiw~\" analyses are selected that match the strictest global pattern. [f it does not accept any of the remaining readings, the second strictest pattern is used, and so on. • Use local patterns to rank the remaining readings. The local patterns contain possible contexts for syntactic functions. The ranking of the readings depends on the length of the contexts associated with the syntactic functions of the sentece. We use both linguistic knowledge, represented as rules, and empirical data collected from tagged corpora. We describe a new way to collect information from a tagged corpus and a way to apply it. In this paper, we are mainly concerned with exploiting the empirical data and combining two different kinds of parsers.","*This work was done when the author worked in the Research Unit for Computational Linguistics at the University of Itelsinki.

Althought, the ENGCG parser works very well in part-of-speech tagging, the syntactic descriptions are still problematic. In the constraint grammar framework, it is quite hard to make linguistic generalisations that can be applied reliably. To resolve the remaining ambiguity we generate, by using a tagged corpus, a knowledge-base that contains information about both the general structure of the sentences and the local contexts of tim syntactic tags. The general structure contains information about where, for example, subjects, objects and main verbs appear and how they follow one another. It does not pay any attention to their potential modiliers. The modifier-head relations are resolved by using the local context i.e. by looking at what kinds of words there are in the neighbourhood.","The method is robust in the sense that it is ahle to handle very large corpora. Although rule-b~med parsers usually perlbrrn slowly, 0rot is not the ca.qe with ENGCG. With the English grammar, the Constraint Granun;~r Parser implementation by Pasi Tapanainen analyses 400 words 2 per second on a Spare-Station 10/:30. q'hat is, one million words are processed in about 40 minutes. 'l'he pattern parser for empirical patterns runs somewhat slower, about 100 words per second.","1 But even then some of tile original ,xlternative analyses are removed","'2InchMing all steps of preprocessing, morphologlcM analysis, disambiguation and syntactic analysis. The speed of morphological disamblguation alone exceeds 1000 words per second. (,29","2 KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION We have used two schemes to extract knowledge from corpora. Both produce readable patterns that can be verified by a linguist. In the first scheme, sentences are handled as units and information about the structure of the sentence is extracted. 0nly the main constituents (like subject, objects) of the sentence are treated at this stage. The second scheme works with local context and looks only a few words to the right and to the left. It is used to resolve the nmdifier-t,ead dependencies in the phrases.","First, we form an axis of the sentence using some given set of syntactic tags. We collect several layers of patterns that may be partly redundant with each other. For instance, simplifying a little, we can say that a sentence can be of the form subjecl -- main verb and there may be other words before and after the subject and main verb. We may also say that a sentence can be of the form subject -- main verb -- object. The latter is totally covered by the former because the former statement does not prohibit the appearance of an object but does not require it either.","The redundant patterns are collected on purpose. During parsing we try to find the strictest frame for the sentence. If we can not apply some pattern because it conflicts with the sentence, we may use other, possibly more general, pattern. For instance, an axis that describes all accepted combinations of subject, objects and main verbs in the sentence, is stricter than an axis that describes all accepted combinations of subjects and main verbs. After applying the axes, the parser's output is usually still ambiguous because all syntactic tags are not taken into account yet (we do not handle, for instance, determiners and adjective premodifiers here). The remaining ambiguity is resolved using local information derived from a corpus. The second phase has a more probabilistie fiavour, although no actual probabilities are computed. We represent information in a readable form, where all possible contexts, that are common enough, are listed for each syntactic tag. The length of the contexts may vary. The common contexts arc longer than the rare ones. In parsing, we try to find a match for each word in a maximally long context.","Briefly, the relation between tim axes and the joints is following. The axes force sentences to comply with the established frames. If more than one possibility is found, the joints are used to rank them. 2.1 The sentence axis In this section we present a new method to collect information from a tagged corpus. We define a new concept, a sentence axis. The sentence axis is a pattern that describes the sentence structure at an appropriate level. We use it to select a group of possible analyses for the sentence. In our implementation, we form a group of sentence axes and the parser selects, using the axes, those analyses of the sentence that match all or as many as possible sentence axes.","We define the sentence axis in the following way. Let S be a set of sentences and T a, set of syntactic tags. The sentence axis of S according to tags T shows the order of appearance of any tag in T for every sentence in S.","Itere, we will demonstrate the usage of a sentence axis with one sentence. In our real application we, of course, use more text to build up a database of sentence axes. Consider the following sentence a ISUBJ would_+FAUXV also_ADVL increase_-FMAINV child NN>"]},{"title":"benefiLOBa","paragraphs":[", give_-FMAINV some_QN> help OBJ t0_AI)VL the 1)N> car_NN> industry <P and CC relax_-FMAINV r~,les OBa governing_<NOM-FMAiNV Iocal AN> avthority_NN> capital_AN> reeeipts OBJ , alIowing_-FMAINV councils SUBJ /o_INFMAI{K> spend_-FMAINV more ADVL.","The axis according to the manually defined set T = { SUBJ +FAUXV +FMAINV } is","• ..

SUBJ ... which shows what order the elements of set T appear in the sentence above, and where three (lots mean that there may be something between words, e.g. +FAUXV is not followed (in ttfis c~e) immediately by SUBJ. When we have more than one. sentence, ttm axis contains more than one possible order for the elements of set T.","The axis we have extracted is quite general. It de-fines the order in which the finite verbs and subjects in the sentence may occur but it does not say anything about nmdlnite verbs in the sentence. Notice that the second subject is not actually tt,e subject of the finite clause, but the subject of nontinite construction councils to spend more. This is inconvenient, and a question arises whether there should be a specific tag to mark suhjects of the nonllnite clauses. Voutilainen and Tapanaincn [1993] argued that the richer set of tags could make parsing more accurate in a rule-based system. It may be true he.re as well.","We can also specify an axis for verbs of the sentence. 'Fhus the axis according to tim set","{ +FAUXV +FMAINV -FMAINV INFMAI{,K> } is",".... kFAUXV ..... FMAINV ..... FMAINV",".... FMAINV ..... FMAINV .,. INFMAR, K>","-FMAINV • .. The nonlinite verbs occur in this axis four times one after another. We do not want just to list how many times a nonllnite verb may occur (or occurs in a corpus) in this kind of position, so we clearly need some generalisations.","The fundamental rule ofgeneralisation that we used is the following: Anything that is repeated may be repeated any number of times.","We mark this using l)rackets and a plus sign. The generalised axis for the above axis is • .. +FAUXV [ .... FMAINV ]+ • .. INI,'MARK> -FMAINV ...","aThe tag set is adapted from the Constraint Grammar of English as it is. It is more extensive than commonly used in tagged corpora projects (see Appendix A). 630 We can also repeat longer sequences, for instance the set","{ --FMAINV <N()M-I,'MAINV +FAUXV","SUBJ OBJ } provides the axis SUBJ +FAUXV ....

OBJ here.","Another generalisation can be made using equivalence clauses. We can ,assign several syntactic tags to the same equivalence class (for instance -I\"MAINV, < NOM-FMAIN V arrd < P-FMA [N V), and then gen-. crate axes as above. 'l'he result would be SUBJ +FAUXV [ ... nonfinv ... OBJ ]-I- • .. nontinv SUBJ ... nonfinv ... where nonfinv denotes both -FMAINV ;u,d <NOM FMAINV (and also <P-.1,'MAINV).","The equivalence classes are essential in the present tag set because the syntactic arguments of finite verbs are not distinguished from the arguments of nontlnite verbs. Using equivalence classes for the finite attd non-finite verbs, we may tmiht an generallsation that ;tl)- plies to both types of clauses. Another way to solve the problem, is to add new tags for the arguments of the nontinite clauses, arid make several axes for them. 2.2 Local patterns In the second phase of the pattern parsing scheme we apply local patterns, the joints. They contain ioformation about what kinds of modifiers have what kinds of heads, and vice versa.","For instance, in the following sentence 4 the words fair and crack are both three ways ambiguous before the axes are applied.

After the axes have been applied, the noun phr,xse a fair crack has the analyses","a DN> fairAN>/NN> crack OBJ. The word fairis still left partly ambiguous. We resolve this ambiguity using the joints.","4This analysis is comparable to the output of I'3NCCG. The ambiguity is marked here using the slash.

Tim sentence is represented internally in the parser in such a way that if the axes make this distinction, i.e. force the.re to be exactly one subject complement, there are only two possil)le paths which the joints can select from: less AD-A> attenlive_l'COMPL- S and less J'COMPl,- S attentive <NOM.","Generating the joints is quite straightforward.

Local context information was derived from corpora that were analysed by ENGCG. We generated three different parsers using three different corpora 6. Each corpus contains about 10 million words. For evaluation we used four test samples (in Figure 1). Three of them were taken frmn corpora that we used to generate the parsers and one is an addi-tional sample. The samples that are named bbl, today and wsj belong to the corpora from which three different joint parsers, called BB1, TODAY and WSJ respectively, were generated. Sample bb~ is the addi-tional sample that is not used during development of the parsers. The ambiguity rate tells us how much ambiguity is left after ENGCG analysis, i.e. how many words still have one or more alternative syntactic tags. The error rate shows us how many syntactic errors ENGCG has made while analysing the texts. Note that the ambiguity denotes the amount of work to be done, and the error rate denotes the number of errors that already exist in the input of our parser.","All the samples were analysed with each generated parser (in Figure 2). The idea is to find out about the effects of different text types on the generation of the parsers. The present method is applied to reduce the syntactic ambiguity to zero. Success rates variate from 88.5 % to 94.3 % in ditferent samples. There is maximally a 0.5 percentage points difference in the success rate between the parsers when applied to the same data. Applying a parser to a sample from the same corpus of which it was generated does not generally show better results.","Some of the distinctions left open by ENGCG may not be structurally resolvable (see [Karlsson et al., 1994]).

The present method makes it possible to prune the remaining morphological ambiguities, i.e. do some part-of-speech tagging. Morphological ambiguity remains unresoNed if the chosen syntactic tag is present in two or more morphological readings of the same word. Morphological ambiguity 7 is reduced close to zero (about 0.3 % in all the samples together) and the overall success rate of ENGCG + our pattern parser is 98.7 %.","r After ENGCG the amount of nmrphologic',d ambiguity in the test data was 2.9 %, with au error rate of 0.4 %. 632","4 CONCLUSION We discussed combining a linguistic rule-based parser and a corpus-based empirical parser. We divide the parsing process into two parts: applying linguistic information and applying corpus-based patterns. The linguistic rules are regarded ms more reliable than the corpus-based generalisations. They are therefore applied first.","The idea is to use reliable linguistic information as long as it is possible. After certain phase it comes harder and harder to make new linguistic constraints to eliminate the remaining ambiguity. Therefore we use corpus-based patterns to do the remaining dis-and)iguation. The overall success rate of the combination of the linguistic rule-based parser and the corpus-based pattern parser is good. If some unrcsolvable ambiguity is left pending (like prepositional attachment), the total success rate of our morphological and surface-syntactic analysis is only slightly worse than that of many probabilistic part-of-speech taggers. It is a good result because we do more than just label each word with a morphological tags (i.e. noun, verb, etc.), we label them also with syntactic fimction tags (i.e. subject, object, subject complement, etc.). Some improvements might be achieved by modifying the syntactic tag set of ENGCG. As discussed above, the (syntactic) tag set of the ENGCG is not probably optimal. Some ambiguity is not resolvable (like prepositional attachment) and some distinctions arc not made (like subjects of the finite and the non-finite clauses). A better tag set for surface-syntactic parsing is presented in [Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993]. But we have not modified the present tag set because it is not clear whether small changes would improve the result significantly when compared to the effort needed. Although it is not possible to fully disambiguate the syntax in ENGCG, the rate of disambiguation can be improved using a more powerful linguistic rule tbrmalism (see [Koskenniemi el al., 1992; Koskenniemi, 1990; Tapanainen, 1991]). The results reported in this sudy can most likely be improved by writing a syntactic grammar in the finite-state framework. The same kind of pattern parser could then be used for disambiguating the resulting analyses.","5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Constraint Grammar framework was originally proposed by Fred Karlsson [1990].
