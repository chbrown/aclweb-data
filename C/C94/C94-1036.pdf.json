In this paper we describe our method and experimental result on Japanese and Chinese se~,tences. As will be seen in the body of this paper, the result shows that this systent is etlicient for most of tile sentences. 1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION An English sentence has several words and those words are separated with a space, it is e~usy to divide an English sentence into words. I[owever a a apalmse sentence needs parsing if you want to pick up the words in the sentence. This paper is on dividing non-separated language sentences into words(morphemes) without using any grammatical information. Instead, this system uses the statistic information between morphenws to select best ways of segmenting sentences in non-separated languages.","Thinldng about segmenting a sentence into pieces, it is not very hard to divide a sentence using a certain dictionary for that. The problem is how to decide which 'segmentation' the t)est answer is. For examl)le , there must be several ways of segmenting a Japanese sentence written in lliragana(Jal)a,lese alphabet). Maybe a lot more than 'several'. So, to make the segmenting system useful, we have to cot> sider how to pick up the right segmented sentences from all the possible seems-like-scgrne, nted sentences,","This system is to use statistical inforn,ation between morphemes to see how 'sentence-like'(how 'likely' to happen a.s a sentence) the se.gmented string is. To get the statistical association between words, mutual information(MI) comes to be one of the most interesting method. In this paper MI is used to calculate the relationship betwee.n words found ill the given sentence. A corpus of sentences is used to gain the MI.","'Fo implement this method, we iml)lemented a system MSS(Morphological Segmentation using Statistical information). What MSS does is to find the best way of segmenting a non-separated language, sentence into morphemes without depending on granamatieal information. We can apply this system to many languages. ~2 )/[ORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 2.1 What; a Morphological Analysis Is A morpheme is the smallest refit of a string of characters which has a certain linguistic l/leaning itself. It includes both content words and flmction words, in this l)aper the definition of a morl)heme is a string of characters which is looked u I) in tile dictionary.","Morphoh)gical analysis is to:","l) recognize the smallest units making up tile given sentellce","if the sentence is of a l|on-separated hmguage, divide the sentence into morphenms (automatic segmentation), and","2) check the morlflmmes whether they are the right units to make up the sentence. 2.2 Segmenting Methods We have some ways to segment a non-separated sentence into meaningflll morphemes. These three methods exl)lained below are the most popular ones to segment ,I apanese sentences.","• The longest-sc'gment method: l~,ead the given sentence fi'om left to right and cut it with longest l)ossible segment. For exampie, if we get 'isheohl' first we look for segments wilich uses the/irst few lette,'s in it,'i' and 'is'. it is ol)vious that 'i';' is"]},{"title":"loIlger thall","paragraphs":["'i', SO tile system takes 'is' as the segment.

'l'his method is to seg:- ment Japanese sentence.s, which have content words anti function words together in one bunsetsu most of the time. This method helps not to cut a se, ntenee into too small meaningless pieces. Lettm'-tyl)e, segmenting method: In Japanese language we have three kinds of letters called Iliragana, Katakana and Kanji. This 227 method divides a Japanese sentence into meaningful segments checking the type of letters."]},{"title":"2.3 The Necessity of Morphological Analysis","paragraphs":["When we translate an English sentence into another language, the easiest way is to change the words in the sentence into the corresponded words in the target language. It is not a very hard job. All we have to do is to look up the words in the dictionary, flowever when it comes to a non-separated language, it is not as simple. An non-separated language does not show the segments included in a sentence. For example, a Japanese sentence does not have any space between words. A Japanese-speaking person can divide a Japanese sentence into words very easily, how-ever, without arty knowledge in Japanese it is im-possible. When we want a machine to translate an non-separated language into another language, first we need to segment the given sentence into words.","Japanese is not the only language which needs the morphological segmentation. For example, Chinese and Korean are non-separated too. We can apply this MSS system to those languages too, with very simple preparation. We do not have to change the system, just prepare the corpus for the purpose."]},{"title":"2.4 Problems of Morphological Analysis","paragraphs":["The biggest problems through the segmentation of an non-separated language sentence are the ambiguity and unknown words.","For example, niwanihaniwatorigairu."]},{"title":"~: ¢-¢2 N ~: w6","paragraphs":["niwa niha niwatori ga iru A cock is in the yard."]},{"title":"/E I,c t.~ -<NI £'0 ~: v, 6 o","paragraphs":["niwa niha niwa tori ga iru Two birds are in the yard."]},{"title":"1~ tc *gN ~ ~ .a: N 7o","paragraphs":["niwa ni haniwa tori ga iru A clay-figure robber is in the yard. Those sentences are all made of same strings but the included morphemes are different. With dill>rent segments a sentence can have several meanings. Japanese h~ three types of letters: I[iragana, Katakana and Kanji. lIiragana and Katakana are both phonetic symbols, and each Kanji letters has its own meanings. We can put several Kanji letters to one lliragana word. This makes morphological analysis of Japanese sentence very difficult. A Japanese sentence can have more than one morphological segmentation and it is not easy to figure out which one makes sense. Even two or nlore seglnentation can be 'correct' lbr one sentence.","To get the right segmentation of a sentence one may need not only morphological analysis but also semantic analysis or grammatical parsing. In this paper no grammatical information is used arid MI between morphemes becomes the key to solve this problem.","rio deal with unknown words is a big problem in natural language processing(NLP) too. To recognize unknown segments in tim sentences, we have to discuss the likelihood of tim unknown segment being a linguistic word. In this pal)er unknown words are not acceptable as a 'morpheme'. We define that 'morpheme' is a string of characters which is registered in the dictionary. 3 CALCULATING TIlE SCORES OF SENTENCES 3.1 Scores of Sentences When the system searches the ways to divide a sentence into morphemes, more than one segmentation come out most of the time. What we want is one (or more) 'correct' segmeutation and we do not need any other possibilities. If there arc many ways of seg- ,nenting, we need to select the best one of them.
