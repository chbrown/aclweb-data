The assignment of meanings to texts uses the Curry-Howard-Van Benthem correspondence. O. INTRODUCTION In Van Benthem [1986] it was observed that the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and lamtxla terms can be used to obtain a very elegant and principled match between Lambek Categorial Grammar and Montague Semantics. Each proof in the gambek calculus is matched with a lambda term in this approach, and Van Benthem shows how this lambda term can be interpreted as a recipe for obtaining the meaning of the expression that corresponds to the conclusion of the Lambek proof from the meanings of its constituent parts.","Usually the semantics that is obtained in this way is an extensional variant of the semantics given in Montague [1973] (Hendriks [1993] sketches how the method can be generalized for the full intensional fi'agment). However, it is generally acknowledged nowadays that the empirical coverage of classical Montague Grammar falls short in some important respects. Research in semantics in the last fifteen years or so has in-creasingly been concerned with a set of puzzles for which Montague's original system does not seem to provide us with adequate answers. The puzzles I am referring to have to do with the intricacies of anaphoric linking. What is the mechanism behind ordinary cross-sentential anaphora, as in 'Harry has a cat. He feeds it'? Is it essentially the same mechanism as the one that is at work in the case of temporal anaphora? I low is it possible that in Geach's notorious 'donkey' sentences, such as 'If a farmer owns a donkey, he beats it', the noun phrase 'a farmer' is linked to the anaphoric pronoun 'it' without its having scope over the conditional and why is it that the noun phrase is interpreted as a universal quantitier, not as an existential one?","While it has turned out rather fi'uitless to stt, dy these and similar questions within classical Montague Grammar (MG), they can be studied profitably within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT, see Heim [1982, 1983], Kamp [1981], Kamp & Reyle [1993]). This semantic theory offers interesting analyses of tile phenomena that were mentioned above and many researchers in the field now adopt some form of DRT as the formalism underlying their semantical investigations.","But the shift of paradigm seems to have its drawbacks too. Barwise [1987] and Rooth [198711, for example, observe that the new theory does not give us the nice unified account of norm phrases as generalized quantifiers that Montagut's approach had to offer and it is also clear from Ka,n 1) & Reyle [1993] that the standard DRT treatment of coordination in arbitrary categories cannot claim the elegance of the Montagovian treatment. For the purposes of this paper a third consequence of the paradigm shift is important. The Curry-Howard-Van B enthem method of providing l~mlbek proofs with meanings requires that meanings be expressed as typed lambda terms. Since this is not the case in standard DRT, the latter has no natural interface with Lambek Catego,'ial Grammar.","It seems then that the niceties of MG and DRT have a complementary distribution and that considerablc advantages could be gained from merging the two, provided that the best of both worlds can be retained in the merge. In fact the last eight years have witnessed a growing convergence between the two sem:mtic frameworks. The articles by Barwise and Rooth that were mentioned above are early examples of this trend. Other important examples are Zeew~t [1989] and Groenendijk & Stokhof [1990, 1991].","None of these l)apers gives the combination of DRT and type logic that is needed for attach-ing the first to Lambek's calculus, but in Muskens [forthcoming] it was shown how the necessary fusion can be obtained. The essential obserwttion is that the meanings of DRT's discourse representation structures (boxes) are first order definable relations. They can thus be expressed within first order logic and within the first order part of ordinary type logic (i.e. the logic that was described in Church [1940], Gallin [197511 and Andrews [1986]).

AX2 says that two states cannot be different if they agree in all pigeon-holes. AX3 makes sure that different discourse referents refer to different pigeon-holes, so that an update on one discourse referent will not result in a change in some other discourse referent's value.","Type logic enriched with these three first-order non-logical axioms has the very useful property that it allows us to have a tk~rm of the 'unselective binding' that seems to be omnipresent in natural language (see Lewis [1975]). Since states correspond to lists of items, quantifying over states corresponds to quantifying over such lists. The following lemma gives a precise formulation of this phenomenon; it has an elementary proof. UNSELF, CI'IVE BINDING LEMMA.

While Groenendijk & Stokhof giw; a Tarski definition for DRT in terms of set theory and thus interpret the object DRT language in a metalanguage, the clauses given above are simply abbreviations on the object level of standard type logic. Apart from this difference, tile chmses given above and tile clauses given by Oroenendijk & Stokhof are tnueh the same. 4. FROM SEMANTIC RECIPES TO BOXES Now that we have the DRT language as it part of type logic, connecting l~ambck proofs for sentenccs and texts with Discourse Representation 511 Structures is just plain sailing. All that needs to be done is to define a function TYPE of the kind described in section 3 and to specify a lexicon for some fragment of English. The general mechanism that assigns meanings to proofs will then take care of the rest. The category-to-type function TYPE is defined as follows. WYPE(txt) TYPE(s) = s(s0, TYPE(n) = ~ and TYPE(cn) = z(s(st)), while TYPE(a / b) = TYPE(b \\ a) = (TYPE(b), TYPE(a)) in accordance with our previous requirement, It is handy to abbreviate a type of the form at(..."]},{"title":"(ctn(s(st))... )","paragraphs":["as [a,... a,,], so that the type of a sentence now becomes [1 (a box!), the type of a common noun [or] and so on.","In Table 1 the lexicon for a limited fragment of English is given. The sentences in this fragment are indexed as in Barwise [1987]: possible an-tecedents with superscripts, anaphors with subscripts. The second column assigns one or two categories to each word in the first column, the third column lists the types that correspond to these categories according to the function TYPE and the last column gives each word a translation of this type. Here P is a variable of type [or], P and q are variables of type [], and v is a variable of type ~r.","Let us see how this immediately provides us with a semantics.

FROM BOXES TO TRUTll CONDITIONS Wc now have a way to provide the expressio,ls of our fragmcnt automatically with Discourse Representation Structures which denote relations between states, but of course we arc also interested in the truth conditions of a given text. These we equate with the domain of the relation that is denoted by its box translation (as is done in Groenendijk & Stokhof [11991]). Theoretically, if we are in the possession of a box (/), we also have its truth conditions, since these are denoted by the first-oMer terln xiqj(q)(i)(j)). but in practice, reducing the last term to some manageable first-order term may be a less than trivial task. Therefore we define an algorithmic function that can do the job for us. The function given will in fact be a slight extension of a sinlilar function defined in Kamp & Reyle [1993].","First some technicalities.
