In other words, when there are multiple zero-pronouns, only one of the zero-pronouns has any significance, and ally other zero-pronoun might as well have been overtly expressed. But, because entities become zero-pronouns in order to avoid unnaturalness due to redundancy, zero-pronouns can be said to be salient enough to be understood without being overt. Iu effect, this means that a greater amount of attention is placed on them than entities that were overtly expressed. This is shown through an example.","Taking her approach, some simple extensions are made to see how well the ordering of entities in centering would work for multiple zero-pronouns. First, the antecedent for the Cb-eueoding zero-pronoun is chosen.as shown in [Kameyama 85]. Basically, this consists of choosing the entity with the highest degree of salience in the previous sentence. Then, the next most salient zero-pronoun according to the ordering of degrees of salience given in the previous section is considered. The antecedent for this zero-pronoun is the most salient entity fi'om the previous sentence which will not contradict any possible constraints. At this point, we only consider semantic constraints for excluding such sentences as \"The desk ate fish\" and contra-index constraints for excluding such sentences as \"Jack ate Jack.\" Any other zero-pronouns are handled in tile same manner. For example, the following discourse is examinedl:","Example 1:","(1) Taro wa Jiro to shokuji chuu de atta. Taro Top/Sub airo with meal during was Taro was h.avin 9 a meal wilh. airo. Cb: --, Cf: Taro > .}ire","(2) @ Saburo we mikaketa. Sub Saburo Obj saw (Taw) saw SabTtro. Cb: Taro, Cf: Saburo","(3) ~ • airo ni shoukaishita. Sub Obj Jiro Obj2 introduced (Taro) introduced (5'aburo) to Jiro.","(4) ¢ q' Shokuji ni sasotta. Sub Obj meal Obj2 invited (Taw) invited (Sal, uro) to lhe meal.","1 \"¢5\" denotes zero-pronouns, and Top, Sub, Obj, Obj2 de~ notes Topic, Subject, Object, and Object2, respectively.","In sentence (1), tile Cfs are ordered as Taro > Jiro, since Topic is the most salient entity. In sentence (2), the entity with the highest degree of salience fi'o,n the previous sentence (Taro) is chosen as tile zero-pronoun's antecedent, and becomes the Cb, with Saburo becoming a Cf. In tile third sentence, after Taro is chosen as the subject of the sentence, since there is only Saburo left,, Saburo becomes the antecedent of tile object zero-pronoun, assuming that there is some sort of knowledge preventing Taro from becoming the object.","After sentence (3), the ordering of noun phrases would be as follows: Taro (Cb) > Jiro (Cf- Obj2) = Saburo (Cf- Oh j) This means that sentence (4) is ambiguous, having tile following possible interpretations: (a) Taro invited Jiro to the meal. (b) Taro invited Saburo to the rneal.","But, the preferred meaning is (b). So, this would mean that the ordering should be as follows: Taro > Eaburo > Jiro","This example shows that when trying to interpret more than one zero-pronoun, the ordering of noun phrases according to Kameyama's acconnt may not be optimal. Of course, this can be rectified by chang-ing the ordering of the degree of salience so that Object is higher than Object2, and as noted later in the paper this will actually take place. But, suppose sentence (3) in Example 2 is replaced with the following sentence:","(3') q5 '-b Jiro we shoukaishita. Sub Obj2 airo Obj introduced (Ta,,) i,,.t,~od,,ce~ ai,'o (to S,,b,,,'o).","Even in this case, the interpretation of sentence (4) would not change 2. So, the ordering of zero-pronoun not being optimal, i.e. that zero-pronouns are more likely to become zero-pronouns again than overt noun phrases, would seeln to be the more logical choice.","So, we propose that \"entities that have become zero-pronouns are more centered in tile discourse than those that have been overtly expressed.\" There-fore, tile centering model has been extended to tile following two lists to handle entities (noun phrases) that appear in a sentence:","~Althougb it should be noted that it doesn't seem to be ,as strongly preferred as before. 1752","(1) Center List . .. Entities in asentence that have becolne zero-])rOllOtlns.","(2) Possible Center List; •..

This line is basically the same as l(ameyama's ordering, except that Object is deemed to be more salient than Object2. This was because, after making some prelhninary evaluations of our model, Object was Rmnd to have at slightly higher degree of salience than Object2.","The following two lines are for ally entities that atpl)car in subordinate (:l~mses. '['here doesn't seem to be at clear cut difference between the Subject, Object, and Obje.ct2 of subordinatte clauses, so they are Ilcmdled at the same level. The difference between the lnain clause and any sul)ordinate clauses captures the intuition that entities in the main chmse are. more s~dient than those in subordinate ones.","There is one exception to the Center List Model. It is tile salience of the Topic in the Possible Center 1153 List. As can be surmised from the term itself, tim 'Fopie is special in that the sentence contains information about the entity corresponding to the Topic. In other words, the sentence is usually about the 3bpicalized entity. So, it was placed at. the same level as the Object in the Center List."]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["Experiment and"]},{"title":"Discussion","paragraphs":["An experiment was done to show the effectiveness of the Center last Model in interpreting pronouns and zero-pronouns. A total of 160 sentences from the following four discourses were used:","• \"Ushikata To Yainanba\" [Tsul)ota 75] (Japanese folklore - 70 sentences)","• \"Madogiwa No Totto-clmn\" [Kuroyanagi 81] (Story--- 51 sentences)","• \"Yasei Doubutsu '.I'o Tomoni\" (Newspaper col-Hllln) - \"Baison\" [Obara 91] (15 sentences) - \"h'ie Wani\"[Obara 92] (24 sentences)","This section will first describe the simple implenlentation used in the experiment. Then, it is evaluated (Table 1), followed by a eonll,a.rison (Table 2) with Kameyama's method. 3.1 Implementation","The implementation is kept simple to demonstrate the eft'eel of the Center List. Semantic constraints on the type of entity that a (zero) pronoun may refer to -- for example, the Subject of 'eat' must be animate -, and contra-index constraints for restricting combinations of eoreferring entities within a sentence - for example, tile Subject and Object of 'eat.' cannot be the same entity - are used. In addMon, a constraint concerning tire subject and identification 4 of Cbs in adjacent sentences is used [Kameyama 86], except it applies to each entity in the Center List of adjacent sentences as follows: Two zero-pronouns that appear ill the Cell-ter List of adjacent sentences should share one of the following properties (in descend-ing order of pret?rence): (l) id'entitication and subject, (2) identification only, (3) subject only, (4) non-identification and not> subject.","41(ameymna's terminology for l~mpathy [Kuno 78]. It shows the perspective from which an event is described.","Of course, tire Center List and the Possible Center List by themselves will not be able to handle antecedents that arc not in the previous sentence. In order to solve this problem, an ad hoc approach was taken by adding the following two lists:","• Past Center List ... Entities that have previously been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun, but do not appear in the current sentence.","• Noun List ... Entities that have never been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun. In order to avoid combinatorial explosion, the entities that are held in these two lists are limited to those which appear in the previous three sentences.","Each entity in the four lists is assigned a score to show its degree of salience. In other words, tbe score shows the possibility of beconfing a zero (or overt) pronoun in the next sentence.","After morphological and syntactic analysis, the interpretation process is basically carried out as follows:","(1) Using the semantic constraints, possible antecedents for pronouns and zeroq)ronouns are found from the Center List, Possible Center List, Past Center last, and Nolln List. (2) Combinations of possible antecedents are made. (3) Contra-index constraints are applied. (4) Each combination is given a score as follows:","(4.l) Compute the sum of the scores that each possible antecedent was given.","(4.2) Give bonus scores according to the subject and identification constraint.","(5) The combination with the highest score is ch{> sell as the combination with the inost probable antecedents.","(6) The Center List, Possible Center List, etc. are updated."]},{"title":"3.2 Evaluation","paragraphs":["Table 1 shows our results.
