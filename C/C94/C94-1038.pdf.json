We propose that the key to the solution is hat in the non-alternating cases, prepositions are rworporated into the verb in lexical syntax just as shelve n Fig. 3. For exmnple, the lexical entries for pout, and 'over contain prepositions as shown in (10). We assume hat the lcxical representation for the prepositions encodes peeifications for figure and ground, represented as F ~nd G in (10). In essence, whatX on Y means is that X afigure on the ground Y. ht fact, this is tim essence ~f what prepositions \"mean\", at an abstract level. Thus he prepositions are the primitives in our system, and oncepts such as figure and ground are deriwttive. This ntaihnent is illustrated by the linking lines in Fig. 5. cover(X,Y)+with(G,F)","Fig. 5 An Explanation For The Spray-Load Alternation","The lexical entry for load does not contain a preposition nd hence is free to alternate. Thus the reason why a erb does not participate in part of an alternation ix that : incorporates lexical material which clashes with otential complements. The reason that 'cover the blanket n the baby' is bad is that covet\" already encodes the igure and ground relationship by incorporating with into :s representatoin--that is, the preposition with is frozen \"lto the verb's representation. Adding an overt PP with n creates a clash in figure and ground relations.

Ontologically speaking, then, what language parameters are is the presence or absence of lexical material in the morphological component. The observed patterns in language variation is then reflected in morphological systematicity. For example, the fact that Japanese has richer possibilities in certain verbal patterns is derived from its morphological inventory. In specific, the reason that it is impossible for English verbs to behave like certain corresponding Japanese verbs is that English lacks an equivalent of tim Japanese aspectual morphetnes ts'ukusu 'exhaust', kakeru 'trajectory verb', etc) ~ But recall, we find that load, for example does behave precisely like its corresponding verbs in Japanese, llindi, Bengali, and Greek. in cases where verbs do m)t appear to behave alike, apparent differences are resolved hy a process of language particula,\" morphological behavior: lor example, the verbal suffixes (and prefixes) of Japanese such as -tsukusu 'exhaust' alter verb argument structure enough to bring them into correspondence with their former English noncounterparts.

Given the universal aspects of our lexical representations, we also expect manageable applications to machine translation, along the lines that we have suggested.","References","]hnonds, J.E. (1991).
