'/'he basis is the computation of a flxed point of a linite-state function, i.e. a finite-state transducer. Using these techniques, we have built a program that parses French sentences with a gramnlar of more than 200>000 lexical rules with a typical response time of less than a second. The tirst algorithm computes a fixed point of a non-deterluinistic tinite-state transducer and the second coniplites a lixed point of a deterministic bidirectiollal device called a bimachine. These two algoril;hms point out a new connection between the theory of parsing and the theory of representation of rational transduetions."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Fhlite state devices have recently attracted a hit of interest in computational linguistics.

The inl}ut of the parser is the set so containing as only element the input sentence bounded by the phrase marker [P], i.e. so = {[P] sentence [P]}. The analysis consists in computing sl = f(so), s2 = f(st) until a tixed point is reached, i.e. s t , = f(sp). The set s v contains trees represented by bracketed strings, this set is the set of grammatical analysis of the sentence, it contains more than one element in the case of syntactically ambiguous inputs. Each set sl is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DA(1) Ai, thus the computation consists in applying the transducer 7' on the DAGs eli.

If this operation is applied once more, one gets A4=f(Aa)= fa(A1). This last result, A4, is a fixed point of the transducer f, i.e. f(A4)=A4.
