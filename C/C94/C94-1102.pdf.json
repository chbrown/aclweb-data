Non-direetionality Our mMn motivation was to design a system where not only the formalism but also the system engine is bi-directional. In [Lepage 91], we sketched such an engine tbr a rule-based al)proach.","From a theoretical point of view, such a system is also more interesting than a system where, although the formalism would be bi-directional, analysis and genera-Lion would be separate modules resulting from different compilations.","In our sketch, a more general property than bi-direct:ionality mue,'go,¢: ,ro,>direclioTJagil!l. IGdirectionality is just the property of executing analysis and generation with the same set of specifications, whereas noudirectionality allows more: a complete sentence and its complete analysis can be built from a partial specification of the sentence and a partial description of tile associated structure. 1.2 Self-assessment A second motivation lles in a flaw of rule-based systems using context-flee parsers, which is that they often fail to deliver a solution for trivia[ reasons such ~ a word missing in a dictionary. On the contrary, our system al.- ways delivers an output for any input, would the solution be \"bad\". O[\" course, this woukl be of no meaning if the quality of outputs wotfid not be evahtated. IIence, when delivering a solution, the system scores it.","Some machine translation systems viewed as expert systems may return an evaluation of their work in terms of their knowledge (grammar) [Tong 89], some other may evaluate the result according to thesaurus cl~ssificatlon and statistical frequencies [Furuse and lida 92b1, but all these methods are specific. Ifere, on the contrary, the system delivers a score which is a formal distance between the input and the output. Thus, it is independent of the linguistic representation chosen (dependency or constituency). '[Fhis is not the case of a proposal such as [llarrison el al. 91].","'1?his score is a possible answer to the serious lack of assessment in natural language processing, ~m it, may apply to any other system, leading to reliable comparisons of inl;rinsic performances"]},{"title":"2 Realisation","paragraphs":["Genetic algorith,ns constiL~lte a possible answer to tJie previous rnotivatior~s.

For each individual, one can compute a funct.ion, called the filT+ess flutction. Those individuals for which the fitness fm~ction is optimmn,'are the besl i.ndividuals.","From two individm~.ls, one can derive two Imw imlivldunls by cuttinv: lheu! itlt~ two pieces and gluing the 616 pieces back in the way ilhistrated in Figure 1. \"J'}lis is crossover.

In the l,.~t generalion, the best individuals are hopefidly solutions of the optimisation problem at hand.","In order to apply genetic algorithms to natural language processing, one hms to determine:","• which data has to play the role of individuals;","• consequently, what a population will be;","• for an individual, wlmt its fitness is;","• in a population, how individuals are selected for","crossover and how it is performed;","• how analysis and generation can be viewed as op-","timisation problems on a population.","'l?he meeting of our research interests with genetic ale gorithrns is a consequence of wirious awulable results.","Firstly, the need for linguistic specification of cornpnter grammars led to the proposal of an original data structure called board. This data structure is neutral with respect to ahalysis and generation. It will play the role of individuals. Boards rely on the data structure of forests, [br which it is possible to define a crossover method.","Secondly, tim stream of exainl)le-b~sed machine translation is now well-established and justifies considering a collection of already parsed sentences as a population [Sadler and Vendelmans 90], [Sate and Nagao 90].","Finally, our recent work on distances, and especially on distances between uncompletely specified boards, led lls to the idea of looking in a data base for boards with the closest distance to a given board. This is an optimisation l)roblem and the tltness of any board will simply be a tilnction of its distance to the given board.","In the following we will first describe the data structures used. Then we will define the finlctions working on these data structures. 2.1. Data struet;ures 2.1.1 Individuals = Boards","The board data structure [Vauquois and Chaplmy 85] w~s introduced ~s an answer to the problem of specification of real-size graminars. A board is the associa. tion of a text with its corresponding, linguistic structure. Moreover, constraints express the linguistic validity of the fine-grained correspondences between different parts of the texts and of the structure [Better and Zaharin 88], [Zaliarin and Lepage 92].

As a matter of fact, a string is a forest with only o.lle level, and a tree is a forest with only one node on the highest level. Now, as forests are the underlying data type, variables stand naturally for subforests. On the string side, considering Variables as forests is by far more interesting than if they would instantiate with one word only.","An interesting property about the board data structure, and it is exactly why it has been devised, is that, because it is the association of a string (the text) and a (linguistic) tree, it is neutral with respect to the main natural language processing operations:","i analysis (input: string, output: tree);","• generation (input: tree, output: string). 2.1.2 PoI)ulatlon = Data lmse of l)oards","Our database of sentences is that of ATR telephone conversations.

They are syntactic constituency trees and are exactly projective, which means that each leaf in the tree corresponds to a word in the sentence in the same order.","As for illustration, all the trees and sentences in this paper are extracted from our data base of boards. Some representational choices have been made to limit the number of morpho-syntactic categories to 14 (and phrase types to 7) and to keep projectivity by all means. 2.2 Pnnetions 2.2.1 Fitness = Distance between forests","We define the fitness of an element in a population (set of boards) ms the distance to a given input (a board) to the system. In other words, we have to define a distance between boards. A simple idea is to take the sum of the distances between the strings on the one band, and the trees on the other hand. As strings and trees are forests a distance on forests is required.","The definition of a distance on forests is given below, with a, b being nodes, u, u ~, v, .v ~ being forests and . denoting concatenation of forests.","dist(a(u').u, b(v').v) = m/n( di~t(a(u'), e) = di~t(~(,,'), b(,,')) disl(a,b) = dist(E,a) := dist(a,E) = di~t(a(,,'),b) + di~t(u,v), di~i(a(u'),e) \"1- di~t(u,b(v').v), dist(Gb(u')) + di~t(a(u').,,,u)) <u,t(<,, ~) 4- <u~(,,', ~-) dist(a,b) -I- dist(u',v') 0 if a=b 1 else (replaeeme)H) 1 (insertion) 1 (deletion)","It is a direct generMisation of two classical distances on strings [Wagner & Fischer 74] and trees [Selkow 77]. Both distances answer the correction problem: what is the minimal number of typing operations needed to transform one object into the other one? In both distances and their generalisation to forests, the typing operations are insertion, deletion and replacement","An extension of the previous distance to forest patterns (i.e. forests containing variables) has been presented in [Lepage etal. 92]. It is no longer a metric, so We call it a proximity score. With this score, the distance between a variable and a constant object is zero by definition. Figure 5 gives an illustration (the unit is a one word or node difference). 2.2.2 Crossover = Exchange of subfore.sts","We turn now to crossover. The first question is how b,_..(Is a]re selected in a population for crossover.","It seems reasonable that those individuals with better fitness value should intervene more in the production of the next generation. Along this line, the simple following law gives the probability of a board i with fitness fl (some reciprocal of distance) to be selected for crossover:"]},{"title":"f~","paragraphs":["Pi =","As for crossover itself, it has to be defined on strings and on trees.","On strings, be they chromosomes or sequences of bii,s, crossover is generally performed as ilhlstrated in Figure 1.
