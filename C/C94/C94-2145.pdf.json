As well as having in common many formal properties, these formalisms also support, often by explicit de.sign, descriptions from a similarly convergent range o[' linguistic theories, which we might reasonably label \"[lPSG-like\".","Given the considerable common ground between such formalisms, it is reasonable to begin to ~sk questions about their intertranslatal)ility, or, ht programnling language terms, the relative ease with which it is possible to \"port\" a grammar from one such formal-isnl to another. Such questious are clearly of interest ['or tile enterprise of recovering a.s much as possible of the existing stock of already encoded linguistic knowledge, perhaps for reuse in a more modern theoretical ['ramework. They are also of relevance for any attempts to build in portability from the start in ongoing new grammar writing.","At present, the criteria for determining whether a particular translation is successful are extremely fuzzy. Apart from anything else, they will presumably depend to some extent on external goals, such as, for example, whether the results will be used in a practical, rnnning system or just in a laboratory experiment to show the feasibility of a particular theoretical approach. In our work, we have. a.ssulned that, if the translation is intended ,as more than a sterile exercise, then the information in the source description must be worth conserving and hence worth translating. More-over, we suppose that the resulting target gramInar will need to be maintained and extendcd, and hence should be well-understood and well-behaved. Given these assumptions, we can begin to impose some conditions on what constitutes a \"good\" translation; in effect, in a translation from grammar A to grammar B:","*Currently affiliated to the Institute for Computational IAnguistics, University of Stuttgart, Azenbergstr.12, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany, cj(~ims.mfi-stuttgart.dc",") In the interests of brevity, we shall often use the term grammar to refer to the collection of formal devices which comprise all aspects of a linguistic description, encomn&sslng both grammaticM and lexical inforrn,~tion. This is purely a notational convenience and in no way implies a commitment to the primacy of syntax.","• B and A should have the same input-output behaviour.","• B should conserve as much as possible of the conceptual shape of A.","• B should have comparable or better run-time performance with respect to A.","The first condition is a consequence, if somewhat oversimplified, of tile assumptions we made above, that the main purpose of the exercise is to preserve usefltl information.","The second condition h~Ls to do with the relative expressivity of tile two formalisms involved. In effect, tLow much of the conceptual and organisatioual structure of a linguistic description can pass over un-. changed, and to what extent do conceptual changes that may have to be made obscure our subsequent understanding of the description as a whole?","The question of performance is not limited to the relative execution speed of source and target grammars, though its importance for subsequent maintenance and development cannot be overstated, llow do we approach the case, for example, where the source grammar runs normally in its native environment but the translated form fails to terminate unless the description is completely restructured? And what if the two systems use conflicting criteria for the apportion-ment of procedural control between the linguist and the implementation?","Over the past year, we have been engaged on a nun> bet of experiments designed to investigate these portability issues, and in particular to bring out the implications behind the two related sets of questions about expressivity and performance. In some ways, our work is similar in spirit to the reusability experiments reported in [Arnold el al.,"]},{"title":"1993], though","paragraphs":["these appear to have been limited to translation to a single, rather general formalism, and to have been concerned ahnost entirely with questions of relative expressivity.","The remainder of this paper discusses our own experinrents and comlnents ou some of our more important findings so far. .900"]},{"title":"i 'rl's I t c/31,\" I [al,U A","paragraphs":["Type ltierarchy","I i~xplici~ l)edicated l'ars~r ~_ Morphology yes llO IlO yes _y(~ _~ yes (Jontol Lazy Host l)etermiued Evaluation Language globally globally locally locally yes yes yes no Common Lisp Common Lisp l'rolog Prolog Table 1: A checklist of tile signiticant properties of the sample implementations"]},{"title":"2 Formalisms","paragraphs":["In our experiments to explore the portability of complex constraint-ba.qed grammars we have considered a sample of four imt)lemented formalisms:",".

The nal, ure of experinmnts in portability requires nol, otdy tim selection of source and target tbrmalisms, but also of exatnl)le descriptions to be translat.ed. In this respect we opted for taking grammars \"fronl the wild\", i.e. native, code from one of the sample for malis,ns that was not designed with ally prior consideration of its potential portal)ility. To be more precise, we have worked with a small, lint formally represen- (.alive IIPSG grammar, originally provided as sample data with the TI\"S system, and a somewhat larger and quite intricate gl) grammar of French, which touches on such thorny issues ;us clitic placement and object agreement.

This is central to the success of the enterprise since preservation of concepts defined by the linguist is an essential part of grammar translation. Consequently, we are I)articularly concerned here with the main constructs of a linguistic description: types, relations and lists. We also consider, though to a lesser exl,el,t, purely notational devices like lnacros, which can be useful in organising the conceptual structure of a description. Of lesser importance in the present context. is the treatment of logical structure, in particular disjunction; iu any case, this topic has received a good deal of attention elsewhere (cf [Trost, 1993])."]},{"title":"3.1 Types","paragraphs":["'Fhc role of f~at, ure structure types in constraint-based linguistics t1~ gained increasing importance as a result of the increa~slng popularity, some might s~y donlinance, of IIPSG [Pollard and Sag, 1987, Pollard and Sag, forthcoming]. In HPSG the type system, or type signature, plays a signitlcant role in deiln-ing the (:lass of legal linguistic objects. In fact in the current version of the theory only objects wlmse typ-ing information is fldly resolved are considered to be adequate models of naturally occurring linguistic constructs. Each of the formalisms we consider permits the delinition of feature structure types, but the form and expressivity of these type definitions differ quite considerably, a~s does the significance of type defini-. tions in the description a.s a whole. The extreme cases are TFS, in which the type system is virtually all there is, and ol), where type dellnitions simply constrain the attributes which can occur on a feature structure.","At this point we should note that a type system in the \"true\" or IIPSG sense, requires a notion of type inheritance which can be further subdivided into three COllCeDt8: ® subtype/supertype relations • feature appropriateness conditions • closure conditions Type detinitions which form a type system usually encode immediate subtypes and feature appropriateness conditions, which specify, at le~Lst, tire attributes which 901 head = subst I funct, head(X): !subst(X) subst = noun I verb I adj I prep. subst[PKD:boolean]. noun [CASE: case] . verb[VFOKM:vform,"]},{"title":"AUX:","paragraphs":["boolean, INV: boolean]. Figure h A fragmentary type system rootcd in head and written in TFS are licensed by the type and the types of their values, as in Figure 1. Closure is usually a derived notion, in that only attributes licensed by the type or one of its supertypes may occur, an unlicensed attribute in-curring either further subtyping or inconsistency. UD type definitions cannot of themselves be used to define a hierarchical type system. They give an entirely fiat system with the most absolute closure and the most minimal appropriateness conditions. The type definitions of the other formalisms, TFS, CUF and ALE, differ mainly in the expressivity of their appropriateness conditions, in order of decremsing expressivity, cf [Manandhar, 1993] for a more detailed comparison of these type systems.","Evidently, one of the most basic hurdles to translating any of the other formMisms into UD is the reconstruction of the type system. This was the problem posed in our initial experiment of porting an IIPSG grammar encoded in TFS into up. Our solution to this problem, cf Figure 2, consists of separating out the hierarchies of sub- and supertype dependencies from those of feature appropriateness, so that each node in the type hierarchy is represented by two unary abstraction definitions in the UP encoding. UD types ~ are only utilised on the terminal nodes of the type hierarchy to ensure ultimate closure. In principle the use of any pseudo-type definition will work its way down the dependency hierarchy to the terminal node and then back up the appropriateness hierarchy to gain more information. While this sounds dreadfully inefficient the lazy evaluation strategy adopted in UD in fact avoids most of the computational overhead. 3.2 Relations The other main constructs used for expressing linguistic concepts are relations - or more specifically definite relations since most of these formalisnls are in fact instantiations of the tIShfeld and Smolka notion of a Constraint Logic Programming language [tI6hfcld and Smolka, 1988]. While the same essential notion occurs in all thcse formalisms the terminology is quite 5Type a~ssignmcnts in UD have the form: Variable == type, head(X): !funct(X) subst(X): !noun(X) subst(X): !verb(X) subst(X): !adj(X) subst(X): !prep(X) Subst(X): <X prd> = yes/no","noun(X) X ==","noun !Subst(X) !case(<X case>)","verb(X) X ==","verb !Subst(X) <X aux> ="]},{"title":"yes/no","paragraphs":["<X inv> ="]},{"title":"yes/no","paragraphs":["!vform(<X Worm>) Figure 2: The head system rewritten in UD diverse, including, for instance, relational abstractions (UD) and parametric sorts (CUF). In fact in TFS relational constructs actually take the form of types with features expressing their argument structure, although a relational notation is provided to sweeten the syntax slightly. Since definite relations occur in each of the formalisms, their translation does not pose any immediate problems, and many of their usages are the same, e.g. accounting for relational dependencies and principles in llPSG-style grammars, cf Figure 3. Difficulties do however occur where the usage of relational constructs is restricted. ALE imposes the restriction that true definite relations may only be used in the phrasal domain, attached to phrase structure rules. On first impression, this could pose a serious problem for translations from other formalisms where relations may be used freely in the lexicon. Our experience has shown that many such lexical relations can in fact be encoded using ALE macros, as in Figure 4, which may be parameterised, but require a deterministic expansion. Where operations involving reeursive or disjunctive relations are required there is still the option of encoding the construct as a lexical rule, though with the risk of losing some of the conceptual structure."]},{"title":"hfp(synsem:","paragraphs":["loc: cat: head: Head) :="]},{"title":"synsem:","paragraphs":["loc: cat: head: Head.

We consider two aspects of this topic, the provi-- sion of explicit modules for processing in a particular domaiu, such as syntactic or morllhological analysers, ~md the complex and thorny issue of control information, or who gets control of control. First, though, it is worth emphasising wily we (:onsider performance to be a signilicant issue at all. We are not - yet, anyway","particularly concerned with the real time performance of \"end-user\" allplications. Wc view all of the systelns that implenmnt these formalisms as develop ment environments, even if timy were originally developed as \"academic\" protol,ypes, in several cases with a view to demonstrating it particular theoretical perspective. Accordingly, we feel that it is more appropriate to evaluate their perfornlance with respect to the development loop ~ussociated with grammar writing. More. concretely, if either the analysis or compilation times exceed certain acceptable bounds (determined by pragmatic, external considerations like the attention sl)an of a grammar (levelol)er or lexicographer), then the grammar under development should be re° garded as being, in a purely practical sense, no longer extensible. These may be rather harsh criteria, but we believe they reflect a more realistic sense of what these systems are good for% 4.1 Dedicated Modules A further explicit distinction arises between those tbrmalisrns which include explicit modules for treat-ing either phrasal or morphological structure (UD, ALl';), and those which only l)rovide a theorem prover over linguistic constraints (TFS, CUF). In general, we expect that, other things being equal, a formalism whose implementation contains dedicated processors for phrase structure parsing and/or string processing will have better run-time performance than one which does not, and this is indeed borne out empirically in the behaviour of the systems we considered.","The prc'senee or absence of an explicit parser also ha~s obvious consequences for porting experiments. If there is a parser in the target system and not in the source system then seine phrase structure component must be supplied. This may just be a vacuous structure or it; may he derived from existing components of the source description, llence we have produced three instantiations of the UD translatiou of the TFS-IIPSG gra,mnar: one inw~lving a vacuous phrase structure description, one in which grammar rules are derived from the phrase structure delinitions of the TFS encoding and one ill which full strings are associated with a lexicon of garbage tokens to awfid invoking either of UD's dedicated modnles lbr morphology and syntax.","Portability in the other direction poses considerably greater problems, since not only must the phrase strnc-ture description he encoded, but some parsing strategy must also be detined. In translating the UD grammar into (J/Jl\" we encoded a head coruer parser (cf e.g. [van Noord, t994]) directly in the CUF formalism. In order to obtain adequate results with this strategy it was necessary to make use of all the facilities offered for determining both global and local process control. This sheds a certain anionnt of doubt on the possibility of replicating the CUI\" resnlts within TFS, where explicit local control statements are not permitted. We address the more general i)roblems with the incorporation of control information in the next section.","While the question of translating more or less explicit phra~se structure information is already a diificult one, the issue of porting morphological information is quite chaotic. There is even less agreement on the in.- formation structure of morphological regnlarities than there is on syntactic patterning, avd this fact is re,° tlected in the fact that two of tile systems we have been working with do not oiler any apparatus at all for dealing with sub-word-level phenomena. Moreover, the two formalisms in our sample which (to admit explicit morphological descriptions differ so greatly ill 6That is apart froln acquiring publication.~ (,r qualilicati(ms 903 the form that these components take that they are not directly comparable even with each other r. 4.2 Control Information The final issue that wc turn to is one which is in effect most revealing about how system developers view their users. In terms of our sample formalisms, we once again can distinguish a two-way split, which actually cuts across all of the groupings that we have observed above. The crude characterisation of this distinction is that some formalisms permit the grammar writer to influence the local processing strategy, either in the good, old-fashioned Prolog manner of ordering clauses, as in ALE, or by providing additional control information, such as delay statements in CUF. The other two systems eschew this kind of local tweak-ing of the processing strategy and rely on a global specification of processing behaviour. Of course, this apparent dichotomy is to some extent illusory. Those systems which retain global control usually permit the user to modify certain parameters of this behaviour, and those that permit local control information must also assnme a global control strategy which may bc less forgiving than that in an apparently more totalitarian system. We have two observations in respect of the control strategies adopted by these systems.","The first of these is that some form of lazy evaluation, such as that assumed as a global strategy in both UD and TFS, can become a requirement of a target system when the source system permits lazy evaluation. More explicitly a description may rely on a particular evaluation strategy that cannot be emulated in the target system. This situation actually occurred in the porting of the UD French grammar to ALE. The lack of a lazy evaluation strategy in ALE required a change in the analysis of verbal structure s , so the ALE description is actually different from the original UD one. In a very real sense the port failed, in that, even though in terms of the declarative formalism a compatible description was definable, it turned out that this was not runnable. The class of portable descriptions between ALE and any of the other formalisms is therefore further constrained by the ALE's underlying evahlation strategy.","The second point we would like to make harks back, in many ways, to the warnings inherent in Kaplan's \"procedural seduction\". Kaplan [Kaplan, 1987] reports experiences with the use of ATN parsers which ended with both grammar writers and system developers attempting to improve the performance of the same parser and effectively getting in each other's way. More generally, every time we think we may be making a smart move by some kind of local fix to the con-","7In the case of ALE it would probably be incorrect to speak of a lnorphological analyser since lexical forms are expanded at compile time.","SAt the corresponding point in the CUb\" translation lazy evaluation had to be explicitly enforced by the use of a delay statement trol strategy we also make it more difficult for a really smart optimising controller to do its job properly. Of course we have progressed considerably in the declarativity and monotonicity of our formalisms which we now tend to view as st)ecialiscd logics, but where we have not learnt so much is in our view of the kind of people who arc going to use the implemented system and what they are capable of. Where local control information is specified in the ordering of statements in definitions, we are effectively requiring that the grammar writer be an accomplished logic programmer. Where local control information is added to supplement an existing grammar description the implicit assumption is even more demanding: that there are individuals capable of appcudiug local control information to descriptions that other people have written --- or worse still translated -- and of getting it right. Both of these approaches ultimately assume that it is not only possible but relatively easy to retain a detailed picture of the behaviour of a complex constraint solver.","When translating to a formalism which permits local control from one which does not, the, issue may come down simply to a question of rclativc speed of computation, which is important enough iu itself in practical situations, as we have already pointed out. In cases where the target formalism, like ALE, requires local control information in order to guarantee termination, much more is at stake."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We readily admit that the experiments reported here are still quite unscientific -- or, we would prefer to think, prescientific and we are still feeling our way towards a more rigorous approach to the question of comparability of implemented formalisms, even though the task is noticeably simplified by recent convergence of goals and methods in constraint-ba.sed computational linguistics.","Nonetheless, our experience already suggests, in keeping with [Arnold et al., 1993], that from the point of view of relative expressivity it is possible to move grammars from one formalism to another, and even perhaps to conceive of new grammars which arc designed from the start to be portable across a range of related formalisms.","As regards the set of issues which we have classed to~ gethcr under the heading of performance, on the other hand, there are still many open questions whicb need to be addressed before porting grammars to serious, extensible and maintainable applications can become a realistic enterprise."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The research reported in this paper was funded by the Swiss National Fund for Scientific Research, under project No. 12-32604.9l Situations and Discourse. 904 This work would not have been possible without the cooperation of the developers of the various systems.
