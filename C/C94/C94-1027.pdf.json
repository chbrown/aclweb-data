In this paper, a new part-of-speech tagging method hased on neural networks (Net-Tagger) is presented and its performance is compared to that of a llMM-tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and a trigram-based tagger (Kempe, 1993). It is shown that the Net-Tagger performs as well as the trigram-based tagger and better than the iIMM-tagger."]},{"title":"2 INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Words are often ambiguous in their part of speech. The English word store for example can be either a noun, a finite verb or an infinitive. In an utterance, this ambiguity is normally resolved by the context of a word: e.g. in the seutence \"The 1977 P6's could store two pages of data. \", store can only be an intluitive. A part-of-speech tagger is a system which automatically assigns the part of speech to words using contextual information. Potential applications for part-of-speech taggers exist in many areas inclnding speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation and information retrieval.","l)ifi'ereut methods have been used for the im plemenration of part-of-speech taggers. TAGGIT (Greene, Rnbin, 1971), an early system, which was used for the initial tagging of the Brown corpus was rule-based. It was able to assign the correct part-of-speech to about 77 % of the words in the Brown corpus.","In another approach contextual dependencies are modelled statistically. Churcb (1988) and Kempe (1993) use second order Markov Models and train their systems on large handtagged corpora. Using this metbod, they are able to tag more than 96 % of their test words with the correct part-of-speech. The need for reliably tagged training data, however, is a problem for languages, where such data is not available in sufficient quantities. Jelinek (1985) and Cutting et al. (1992) circumvent this problem by training their taggers on untagged data using tile Itaum-Welch algorithm (also know as the forward-backward algorithm). They report rates of correctly tagged words which are comparable to that presented by Church (1988) and Kempe (1993). A third and rather new approach is tagging with artificial neural networks. In the area of speech recognition neural networks have been used for a decade r, ow. They have shown performances comparable to that of IIidden Ivlarkov model systems or even better (Lippmann, 1989). Part-of-speech prediction is another area, closer to POS tagging, where neural networks have been applied successfidly. Nakamura el; al. (1990) trained a d-layer feed-forward network with up to three preceding part-of-speech tags ,as input to predict the word category of the next word. The prediction accuracy was similar to that of a trigram-b,~sed predictor. Using tile predictor, Nakamura et al. were able to improve the recognition rate of their speech recognition system from 81.0 % to 86.9 %.","Federici and Pirrelli (199a) developed a part-of-speech tagger which is based on a special type of neural network. It disambiguates between alternative morphosyntactic tags which are generated by a roof phological analyzer. The tagger is trained with an analogy-driven learning procedure. Only preliminary results are presented, so that a comparison with other methods is difficult.","Ill this paper, a part-of-speech tagger based on a multilayer perceptrou network is presented. It is similar to tile network of Nakamura et al. (1990) in so far as the same training procedure (Backpropagation) is used; but it differs in the structure of tile network and also in its purpose (disambignation vs. prediction). The performance of tl,e presented tagger is measured and compared to that of two other taggers (Cutting et al., 1992; Kempe,"]},{"title":"1993). 3 NEURAL NETWORKS","paragraphs":["Artificial neural networks consist of a large number of simple processing units.

This complicates the training process, because the output of the network is not correct, when the training starts and therefore, it cannot be fed back directly, when the training starts. Instead a weighted average of the actual output and the target output is used. It resembles more the output of the trained network which is similar (or at least shouhl be similar) to the target output. At tile beginning of the training, the weighting of the target output is high. It fails to zero during the training. The network is trained on a tagged corpus. Target activations are 0 for all output units, excepted for the unit which corresponds to the correct tag, for which it is 1. A slightly modified version of the backpropaga-tion algorithm with momentum term which has been presented in the last section is used: if the difference between the activation of an output unit j and the corresponding target output is below a predefined thresh-old (we used 0.1), the error signal ~pJ is set to zero. In this way the network is forced to pay more attention to larger error signals. This resulted in an improvement of the tagging accuracy by more than 1 percent.","Network architectures with and without hidden layers have been trained and tested. In general, MLP-networks with hidden layers are more powerful than networks without one, but they also need more training and there is a higher risk of overlearning 4. As will be shown in the next section, the Net-Tagger did not profit from a hidden layer.","In both network types, the tagging of a single word is performed by copying the tag probabilities of the current word and its neighbours into the input units, propagating the activations through the network to the output units and determining the output unit which has the highest activation. The tag corresponding to this unit is then attached to the current word.","If the second strongest activation in the output layer is close to the strongest one, tile tag corresponding to the second strongest activation may be given as an alternative output. No additional computation is required for this. Further, it is possible to give a scored list of all tags as output.","aThe output activations of the network do not necessarily sum to 1. Therefore, they should not he interpreted as probabilities."]},{"title":"40verlearning","paragraphs":["means that irrelevant features of the training set are learned.

(1992). it has three parts: a fullform lexicon, a suffix lexicon and a default enlry. No documentation of tile construction algorithm of the su[lix lexicon in (Cutting et al., 1992) was available. Thus, a new method based on information theoretic principles was developed.","During the lookup of a word in the lexicon of the Net-Tagger, the fifllform lexicon is searched first. If the word is found there, the corresponding tag probability vector is returned. Otherwise, the uppercase letters of the word are turned to lowercase, and the search in the fullform lexicon is repeated. If it fails again, the suIfix lexicon is searched next. If none of the previous steps has been snccessfull, tile default entry of the lexicon is returned.","The fullform lexicon was created from a tagged training corpus (some 2 million words of the Penn Treebank Corpus). First, the number of occurrences of each word/tag pair was counted. Afterwards, those tags of each word with an estimated probability of less than 1 percent were removed, because they were in most eases the result of tagging errors in the original corpus.

The tag frequencies of all deleted subnodes of a parent node are collected at the defi, ult node of the parent node. If the default node is the only renlaining subnodc, it is deleted too. In this case, the parent node becomes a leaf and is also checked, whether it is deletable.","To illustrate this process consider the following example, where ess is the suffix of the parent node, less is tim suffix of one child node and hess is the suffix of the other child node.
