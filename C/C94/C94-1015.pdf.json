To snppress the nnnecessary patterns, the surface words in patterns are in principle restricted to functional words, which occur frequently, and which modify or relate content words 2.","Fnr instance, the expression, \"go to the station\" is divided into two constituents \"go\" and \"the station\", and the l)reposition, \"to\" can be identified as a constituent boundary. Therefore, in parsing \"go to the station\", we use tile l)attem, \"X to Y \", which has two variables X and Y, and a constituent boundary, \"to.\" 2.3 Constituent I)oundary marker expressed by a pa,'t-nf-sl)eech hig,'anl","The expression \"1 go\" can be divided into two constituents 'T' and \"go.\" But it has no surface word that divides tile expression into two constituents. In this case, a part-of-speech bigr,'un is used as a constituent boundary.","Suppose th,qt a constituent X is immediately followed by a constituent Y. We express a boundary-marker between X and Y by A-B, where A is a part-of-speech abbreviation of X's last word, and B is a 1)art-of-speech abbreviation of Y's first word. For instance, 'T' and \"go\" are a pronoun and a verb, respectively, so the marker \"pron-verb\" is inserted as abot, ndary marker into \"1 go\". Namely, \"I pron-verb go\", i.e. with the boundary marker inserted into the original input, matches tile pattern \"X pron-verb Y.\" 2.4 Linguistic level","Patterns are classified into (lffferent linguistic levels to limit the explosion of structural ambiguity during parsing.
