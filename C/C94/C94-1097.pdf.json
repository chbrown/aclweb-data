Introduction","paragraphs":["Text-oriented methods and software tools have come to be of primary interest to the NLP community. However, existing tools for natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation (MT) corpus-based research are typically embedded in large, non-adaptable systems which are fundamentally incompatible. Little effort has been made to develop software standards, and software reusability is virtually non-existent. As a result, there is a serious lack of generally usable tools to manipulate and analyze text corpora that arc widely available for research, especially for multi-lingual al)plications. At the same time, the availability of data is hampered by a lack of well-established standards for encoding corpora. Although the Text Encoding Initiativc (TEI) has provided guidelines for text encoding [Sper94], they arc so far largely untested on real-scale data, especially multi-lingual data. Further, the TEl Guidelines offer a broad range of text encoding solutions serving a w~riety of disciplines and applications, and are not intended to provide specific guidance for the purposes of NLP and MT corpus-based research. MIJLTEXT (Multilingual Text Tools and Corpora) ix a recently initiated large-scale project funded under tim Commission of European Communities Linguistic Research and Engineering Program, which is intended to address these problems. The project will contribute to the development of generally usable software tools to nmnipulate and analyse text corpora and to create multi-lingual text corpora with structural and linguistic markt, p. It will attempt to establish conventions for the encoding of such corpora, building on and contributing to the preliminary recommendations of the relevant international and European standardization initiatives. MULTEXT will also work towards establishing a set of guidelines for text software development, which will be wklely published in order to enable future development by others. The project consortimn, consisting of eight academic and research institutions and six major European industrial partners, is committed to make its results, namely corpus, related tools, specifications and accompanying documentation, freely and publicly available."]},{"title":"2. Project Overview","paragraphs":["At the outset of the project, the consortimn will undertake to analyse, test and extend the SGML-based recommendations of the TEl on real-size data, and gradually devch)p encoding conventions specifically suited to nmlti-lingual corpora and the needs of NLP and MT corpus-based researcb. To manipulate large quantities of such texts, the partners will, in collaboration with the recently established Text Software Initiative (TS[), develop conventions fo,\" tool co,~struction and use tbem to build a r:mge of highly language-independent, atomic and cxtensible software tools. These specifications will be the basis for thc development of two major software resources, namely (a) tools for the linguistic annotation of texts (e.g. segmenters, morphological analysers, part of speech disambiguators, aligners, prosody taggers and post-editing tools), and (b) tools for the exploitation of annotated texts (e.g. tools for indexing, search and retrieval, statistics). This software will be implemented under UNIX, while its specific properties should facilitate portability to other systems. Moreover, it will be integrated by means of a common user interface into a text corpus manipulation system expected to provide the basic functionality needed in academic or industrial corpus research. For the overall software design as well as the development of specific components, MULTEXT will capitalise on the experience and, possibly, preliminary results achieved in the ALEP project. By using the emerging software tools, the consortium plans to produce a substantial multilingual corpus, including parallel texts and spoken data, in six EC 588 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Dutch). The entire corpus will be marked for gross logical and structural features; a subset of the corpus will be marked and hand-validated for sentence and sub-sentence features, part of speech, alignment of parallel texts, and speech prosody. All markup will have to comply to the TEI-based corpus encoding conventions established within the project. Tim corl)us will also serve as a tcstbed for the project tools and a resource for future tool development and evaluation. An application programming iuterfime will facilitate the coupling of the progressively refined software and data components with several existing langt, age application systems or prototypes. In particular, the industrial partners phm to develop extraction software fl)r lexieal and terminological infornmtion to complement and improve their Terminology Management, Information R.etrieval or Machine Translation systems. Some effcwt will also be devoted to a prototypical api)lication for testing and comparing successive versions of a Machine Translation system."]},{"title":"3. Background and approach 3.1. Software Standard","paragraphs":["MULTEXT is strongly committed to \"software reusability\", to avoid the re-inventing of tim wheel and development of largely incompatible and non-extcnsihle software that is characteristic of much language-analytic research in the past three decades. Therefore, the project will establish a software standard for the development of its tools. This will enable these tools to be universally used and extended hy others. We outline here the principles (borrowed from [IdeV93a]) nnderlying the MULTEXT approach to software design, which enable flexibility, extendability, and reusability. • Principle 1: lxmguage independence The first goal is to extend existing mctlmds to otlmr European languages. So far, these methods have been applied almost exclusively to English. Therefore, the methods will be adapted to produce language-independent tools, by using an engine-based approach where all hmguage dependent materials arc provided as data. Thus, extension of the tools to cover additional languages will in most cases involve only providing the appropriate tables and rules. • Principle 2: Atomicity Existing text analytic software often comprises large, integrated systems that are nearly impossible to adapt or extend. MULTEXT will produce a set of small tools (often on the order of a few lines of code, with the absolute minimum of t'unctionality) that researchers can use alone or combine to create larger, more complex programs, thereby implementing a \"software l.cgo\" approach. In this way, increasingly complex program bundles can be developed without the overhead of large system design, and with ease of modification since any program can be de-bundled into its constituent programs, each consisting of small, easily understandable piece of code. MULTEXT will bundle its tools in a comprehensive corpus-handling system, as welt as demonstrate their use in several high-level applications, thus showing different ways in which tim \"Legos\" can be recombined in specific applications. • Princil/e 3: OperatotZ~'tream approach MUI.'I'EXT will adopt the operator/stream apl)roach to scfftware design, which has had widespread implementation and use and is generally accepted in research and industry. In particular, it has been used increasingly in computational linguistics applications (see, for instance, [I,ibe92]). The operator/stream approach has served as the basis for the UNIX operating system, which as a result provides a ready-made platform for its implementation. In the operator/stream approach, data flows in unidirectional \"slreams\" between functions. Each of these functions is an \"operator\" that translbrms the data as it passes by. Since everything is understood in terms of what goes in and what comes out, the emphasis is on what needs to be done rather than how it is done. \"Fhis enables a focus on overall algorithms rather titan implementation details. Component functions are independent, and at no point are compiled together in a single program. This is a key point, since it means that each operator can be implemcnted in a different language, developed by different people, tested independently, etc. In addition, new functions can be phlgged into the stream as necded, and all ft, nctions are completely re-usable in other contexts. • Princil~le 4: [hrique &tta type Commtmication between programs will be by lneaus Of flat, ]roman readable streams and files, apart from well-defined, encapsuhlted binary formats for cases such as speech signal, images, or indexes. The only data type is therel'tn'e the stving. There is some overhead in this ;.Ipproilch, since conversion froul string to, s'ty, nulnbcr and back is required I()r numbers that are to be manipulated arithmetically, but tim speed and storage capacities of present-day machines virtu:ally eliminate this concern. More importantly, the use of string data only enables an easy test-modify-test cycle, since the input and outi)ut of any step can be examined and manii)ulated using all-purpose tools freely awtilable on most machines, such as text editors, search software, sorting utilities, etc. Fi,ially, colnplex data types tic programs to specific Izmguages that implement those types. The use of a unique data type eliminates this dependency. A fe,'dure of lilts strategy which is of major importance is that any system can accept flat files. Therefore, data is portable between different systems. In addition, it is lllUCh easier [O port software from system to system, since tim software accepts lhe same kind of input data. l:()r example, a program in C is likely to work on any system with no or very minor modification. 589 • Principle 5: Internal standardfi~rmats (ISFs) To write the compatible set of tools we describe, it is essential that all programs communicate effectively. This demands that internal standard formats (ISFs) for data be developed, to serve as specifications for program development. It is essential that these formats are public, so that any program written anywhere by anyone can use thmn. ISFs, like the functions that process them, are very simple and straightforward. Many ISFs will be needed to accomodate different possible \"interpretations\" of the data, and their development will demand careful consideration of text types, their structures and properties. Therefore, ISF development should build upon the TErs work on text structures and categories and ensure compatibility with it. Note that because ISFs represent only partially the information in an encoded text (that is, whatever is required for certain operations), they do not replace a TEI/SGML encoding of data, which represents all the information in an encoded text and can be used for interchange. Transduction programs to import TEI-eonformant texts into one or more internal standard formats, and vice versa, will be essential. 3.2. Tools All MULTEXT tools will be developed according to the principles outlined above. The project will use only well-known, state-of-the-art methods in tool development, in order to ensure the project's feasibility (e.g., [Chur88], [Cutt92], [Gale9 l ], [Hirst93], [Hirst91]). The project will use these methods to produce a set of tools that is freely available, coherent, extensible, and language independent. The tools will be implemented under UNIX, but will be developed according to principles that will facilitate portability to other systems. The high-level tools produced by the project fall in two general categories of corpus-handling fimetions that are basic across applications (these functions apl)ly to mono-lingual texts, multi-lingual parallel texts, and speech):","• Corpus annotation tools: • segmentcr: marks sentences, quotations, words, abbreviations, names, terms, etc.; • morphological analyser: provides possible lemmas, morpholgical features, and parts of speech; • part of speech disambiguator: disambiguates part of speech where alternatives exist; • aligner: provides alignments of passages among parallel texts; • prosody tagger: derives automatic modelling of F0 curve and symbolic coding of intonation from the speech signal; • post-editing tools: assist in hand validation of automatically annotated corpora. • Corpus exploitation tools: • indexing tools: construct indexes for fast access to data; • search and retrieval tools: browsing, concordancing, retrieval of collocations, etc., based on a given word, words, pattern, syntactic category, etc.;","• statistical and quantitative tools: generate lists and statistics--basic statistics for words, collocates (pattern or part of speech) such as frequency, mutual information, etc. Also word lists, lists by syntactic category, etc. To provide support for these tools, several other general utilities will be required, such as general data manipulation tools, UNIX shell tool, etc. In addition, the tools will be integrated by means of a common user interface into a general-l)urpose corpus manipulation system suitable for NLP and MT research. 3.3. Markup Standard One of the goals of MULTEXT is to develop standards for encoding text corpora. We distinguish four levels of document markup:","• Level O. Document-wide markup: • bibliographic description of the document, etc. • character sets and entities • description of encoding conventions","• Level 1. Gross structural markup: • structural units or text, such as volume, chapter,","etc., down to the level of paragraph • footnotes, titles, headings, tables, figures, etc.",", Level 2. Markup for sub-paragraph structures: • sentences, quotations • words • abbreviations, names, dates, terms, cited words, etc.","• Level 3. Markup for linguistic annotation: • nmrphological information • syntactic information--e.g., part of speech • alignment of parallel texts • prosody Level 0 provides glohal information about the text, its content, and its encoding. Level 1 includes universal text elements down to the level c,f paragraph, which is the smallest unit that can be identified language-independently. 1.evel 2 explictly marks sub-paragraph structures which are usually signalled (sometimes ambiguously) by typography in the text and which are language dependent. Level 3 enriches the text with the results of some linguistic attalyses. The TEI guidelines [Sper94] provide the basis for MUI:FEXT corpus markup for levels 0 (the TEI header), 1 and 2 as well as many elements of level 3. However, the TEl standard will need careful examination and adaptation [IdeV93b]: (1) the TEI sclteme is intended to be maximally applicable to a variety of encoding purposes and applications. Therefore it in many cases specifies several encoding options for the same phenomena, and provkles options and elements without the specific needs of corpus markup in mind. (2) the TEl scheme is not complete; many areas are yet to he addressed. For example, no TEI encoding scheme 590 for some aspects of spoken materials, such as prosody iF0 modelling, synlbolie coding, etc.), exists. (3) the 'l'lZ.l scheme is largely untested on corpora, especially multi-lingual corpora. Therefore, use of tile TEI scheme for corpus eucoding will ahnost certainly require modification and extension. For instance, TEl mechanisms for aligmnent will require exteusion and/or modification to handle lnulti-lingual text alignment and aligmnent of different levels of speech representation (signal, orthographic tra,lscriptiou, i~honelnic transcription, prosody). (4) the TEl scheme specifically does not aiul to provide recomnlendillions for certain content-related eleinents. For example, while the 'tEl provkles several means to mark POS, it is not within tile scope of the TEl to provide a standardized set of POS category #lanles. hlstead, it provides a flexible incehanism that can aecomodate any set of actual tag uames. Similarly, tile TEI does not provide guidelines for uames which might, for example, be used as identifiers for texts, text categories, etc. MULTEXT will use tile TEl scheme as the basis for the developmeut of a \"H']l-confornlant Corptts Em:oditlg Style iCES) that is optimally suited to NI,I' research and can therefore serve its a widely accepted TEl-based style tot European corpus work. 3.4. Corpus Tile goal of MUI.TEXT is not to duplicate the various large mulli-lingual data gathering initiatives by collecting raw data. The intent of the p,oject is to provide a vahlable resource that is not provided elsewhere, in tile form of a high quality multi-lingual corpus for six European languages, annotated for basic struetllral features as well as sub-l)aragraph se,~meiltalioii, POS, and alignment ill parallel texts. The priinary goal of tile MULTEXT corpus is to inovide ;.ill example and testbed for: (1) multi-lingual tools (especially cnginedmsed tools, aligunlent software, and nlulti-lingual exlr;iction tools); and (2) nlarktlp across a large variety of languages (h/cltldirl~.; TEl text markup and the NERC panoeurolman part-of-speech tagset [Mona92]). MUI.TEXT has a secondary but inlportarlt gt)al to provide a corF, us of value for geueral linguistic analytic purposes, a,ld will aim to serve this goal to the extent possible without compromising or coniplicating the primary goal. The corpus will aim for three parts, each comprising six languages (English, French, Gernlan, Italian, Spanish, I)utch): (1) a comparable corpus, consisting of 2M words per language, composed of coral)arabic types of texts fronl two or three different domains. Ten percent of the corpus for each language will be nlarkcd aud hand validated ti)l sul)-lmragraph segmentatiou and POS. (2) a parallel CO#TJIts, composed of fully paralIcl text,; across the six languages and incltiding 2M words per language. Ilalf of the corpus for each hmguage will be marked and hand-villidatcd for sentence alignmeut. Ten percent of tile corpus for each langtiagc will be marked and hand-wilidated for sub-paragraph scglnentation illld POS. (3) a Sillall speech co#7~ltS, consistiug of additiollal niarkup to he tised in conjunction wilh tile F~UROM-I speech database. There is iuoveinenl towards lhe integration of NI.I' and Slmeeh (see, for oxanlple, I{I.SNI]'I'); MUI/I'IiXT will explore the possilfilities for such iutegraiion by attenipting to harmonize tools and llleihods froill both <'u'eiis. MUI.TEXT will pay speeiitl attention to pheilonleua ill the iutorseetion ill' the two doulilius, in particilhlr prosody, whose supra-segulental nattlre invites researc]l iuto the coinplex relatioi~ships it holds with nlorphology alld syntax. To serve its goals, MIJIM'I']XT will aim to construct its CoipUS accoltlillg to the 17111owing principles: ° lJritleip[e I.\" Cotlsistetlcy The salliC six languages will be represented in equal illllotints in all paris of tim corpus. Simihuly, equal anlouilis of the same typos of texts will tm provided for each language. • l'rineiple 2: 1⁄21riely rclther than r¢7)resemativeness The MULTF, XT corpus is small-scale compared to national efforts aimed at providing balanced, representative corpora ill a sitlgle language. The project does not therefore aim at representativeness or balance in constructing its corpus. Instead, tile MUI,TEXT corpus will contain a variety of texls of different types and front different dolllailas, generally following (where apllroflriate ) knowI1 criteria I'rOlll corptls ]hlgilistics. \" I'rim:iple 3.\" lligh quail O, oJ',larkup Ill Ihe slate of the ilrl, autoiil'llic uiarkup of segnlcntation, POS, iuld aligllllleiit is aboul 90..96% COH'OCi for I{nglish (and French in tile case of the tlansard), lu order to provide a reference corpus for ftlrthor testing of inethodologies and tools, MI;II.'I't~,XT will hand-validate a portion ill' its corptlS to lllake it virtually error-free. • Prineilde 4\" Reuse ofavaihthh, &mr MULTEXT is not committed to the goal of collecting data, but rather to enhancing with structural and linguistic annotation data which ulay bc available from other sources.

Because neither of these schemes have been widely tested, the MULTEXT corpus will provide both a testbed and a basis for their evaluation and modification or extension."]},{"title":"4. Exploitation and Future Prospects","paragraphs":["It is expected that the availability of basic multi-lingual tools and data will improve and extend R&D across a wide range of disciplines, including not only the various areas of NLP (language understanding and generation, translation, etc.), but also fields such as speech technology, language learning, lexicography and lexicology, literary and linguistic computing, information retrieval, etc. By feeding the results into several commercial applications systems/prototypes, the project is expected to show the potential of state-of-the-art methods in corpus linguistics for improving industrially relevant language systems and services."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[ldeV93a] Ide, N., Veronis, J.
