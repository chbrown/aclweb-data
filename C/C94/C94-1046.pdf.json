Our research aims at developing such Linguistic Discovery Assistants by merging hyperdocumcnts, Data Base Management Systems and interpretive adaptive interfaces.","We have followed a stepwise approach to the idea in the context of the discovery and learning of lcxical properties of Chinese eh,'uacters, by developing several prototypes.

MOTIVATIONS : C OMPUrER A IDED","DISCOVERY OR LEARNING OF LINGUISTIC","KNOWLEDGE 1.1 A need for making linguistic knowledge accessible","to the user, in Personal MT","A current trend in Personal Machine Translation tends towards opening to the nser the linguistic data that the system is operating upon [1]. Such 'discoverable' environments should allow some free, self-plmmed, or coached investigation to users, and provide these in a suitable expl~matory fonn with a l,'u'ge part of the linguistic material emba)dicd in the personal lingwarc: lexical data bases, syntactic patterns or syntactic rules modules, semantic conlrastive aspects, etc.","Our work is oriented towards a particular aspect of such 'open lingware': the grasp, evcnlu:dly the learning, by monolinguai writers or editors of a document who are working in a language they know imperfectly, of the lexical proi',crties of the language to be used. 1.2 A new resource different from dictionaries","In the context of lexical properties we may at first consider dictionaries to be a straight rcsponsc to such a demand. They usually require of the user some premodelled view of the very organic'alton of the lexical data, a pragmatic know-how of their legibility, or real mastery in order for the searcher user to perform a sensible pruning of the available information. This is particularly true with the lexieal properties of the languages we are concerned with in this project, Chinese and Japanese.","Users may experience thc complexity of the process when, starting from uncertain or incomplete chunks of recollected knowledge, they wish to investigate a word to be ,'tscertained, a num~ce to be expressed, an ideogram to be remembered. Such situations clearly demand a reshaping of dictionaries as interactive knowledge bases, and the proposal of components and coopemlive interfaces wlfich could offer altenmte access schemes to lexic~d data b:t~es, or views of them [11].","Some integrated systems for I)ialogue Based Machine 'l'rm~slation intend to provide the author with the means for interactive consulting of linguistic facts or rules, for instance in the context of lexical or syntactical disambiguation or indirect pre-editing of contextual semantic features, specific to the text to be composed. The I.IDIA architecture [2] and the NAI)IA model [9] certainly illustrate this approach. 1.3 Discovery Assistants, Cooperative Observatories","The development of interactive environments for monolingnal writers leads to modelling new functions for documentation, self-documentation, self-learning and management of indivitlualized personal knowledge bases, to bc pooled into opcn encyclopaedic 'discovery environments', specific components for NLP systems.","Such technologies as hyperdocuments, multimedia and voiced data bases, adaptive interfaces, and the benefits of Computer Aided l.earning techniques may merge to offer solutions in the reahn of such 'cooperative obserwttorics' of linguistic knowledge.","Our project has a stepwise approach to the idea, in the e:tse of the lexical properties of the Chinese ideograms. 2. PROJECT OUTLINE AND PROTOTYPIN(;","SCIIEME 2.1 Comlmter Aided Chinese Character l,earning","The work we report here stems from the initial m()delling of an AAOCC systcm (for 'Apprcntissage Assist6 par Ordinatcur des Caract&es Chinois'), intended to provide motivated users with an adaptive enviromncnt for the atltonomous discovery or rcvicw of character properties Idl, with a deliberate restriction to a hanzi / kanji subset of characters.","llan-zi simply means Chinese (~aractel, and kan-ji (which alliterates the Jboner, and means the same in Japatwse) t'~'tw to a small subset of characters that written Japanese almost entirely borlmved from hanzL and fivm the combination of which Japanese words are derived. We shall call 'hanzi / kanji' the intersection set, that is the hanzi which also are Japanese kataji.","The conceptu:d model of the lcxical data base schematizes different views and levels of investigation of the material.","A first alternative lor the user is to explore a language-","independent view (Fig. 1) of the characters (intrinsic","moq~ho-semantic properties of the hanzi / kanji, shared","by written Chinese, Japanese and Korean), contrasting","with language-related views (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).","These are enriched with groups of other clmracter","properties (phc)nctics, morphological similarities,","contextual semantics...), all su'ongly relevant to one of","tim three languages of nse --presently, only with the","core of the Chinese instanciation. 287 Towards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants...

Such mnemonic m,-u-king will supplement the etymology, while enhancing the user's ~dmaginative memory>> and strongly rehtying visual memory. We also strongly invite the user to personalize his knowledge ba~, through adding his own mnemonics or imaginative productions. 2.2 Basic functionalities","The lexical base initially m(xlelled provides a good coverage of character properties [3] : using one view of the character base, the user may explore language-free morphology (pictogram, stroke number, overall structural vignette, semantic radical, confusing sinfilarities...) and universal semantics, on the other hand --m~d on the other view-- an author can discover language-relevant morphological properties (phonetic component ill its structural valency, homographs, positional wtriants for compound characters, use in composition...), language-tied phonetics (written and voiced pinyin and tone, homophones...), h'ulguage-related semautics. A very detailed set of structural vignettes (simihu\" in","spirit to Ilalpern's patterns [6]) is proposed with a digital","coding, and validated over some 1500 kanji in the lleisig","progression. They may deeply improve le,'u'ner recall of","the over~dl structure of a character. We have lor instance,","with file grey tint giving the position of the semantic key: bright rising sun","tea tiny","Fig 4: l(ramples of structural vignettes Such patterns may also be invoked by the user for the","study of compound ohmactors to be derived from a given","kanji, when recalling some particul,'u\" structural model.","2.3 Multiple prototyping development schenle The first prototype implemented the conceptmd m<u.lcl","of the property base as a highly structured hypertext, using","llyperC,'u'd on Macintosh. We considered this platform a","g(~ trade-off between a vahmble interaction management","system, and a temperate framework for expressing the","object-oriented and reusable view of the base. We then adopted a twofold development scheme, with","both incremental prototyping ill llyperCard, for surface","multimodal data and for tile interlace fimctional layer of","the application, and parallel prototyping on different","development platlk)nrts, to explore different structuring","and searching methods for tile character base. Three tracks were experimented to express character","search modalities in more relincd interactive ways: first a Data Base Management System approach, flmmgh Iwo varianls: (1) ollject-oricnled modelling of tile base (in tOOl'S on a Xerox workstatioq), (2) a rehltional scheme on a standard medium (an Oracle encapsulation in l lypercard on the Macintosh); (3) various sketches of a knowledge base were prototyped in F'rolog with a simplified user interface.","3.

Direct designation is based on a simple selection of the character icons Oil character boards.

G. ~tfiotte & F. Tcheou Multicriterial search (MCS) allows the user, starting from a partial description of the character, from tentatively diserimiuaut properties lie may recall, to refine or focus his request. Partially erroneous demands should be nmuaged adequately by the system (while suggesting dcfault or alternate detenniuatious for dubious prol~)sals, or suppressing irrelevant ones). The elements remembered or ew~k~ by the learner are put forward in a criteria array orgimized in 3 lexical property subclitsses: l~teutial characteristics about thc sought character itself, about its semantic key, and about its phonogr,'unme if it exists (the phonetic marker component, very often structurally present). See Fig. 6. The grid presents main discrimiuaut criteria (left) and secondary characteristics (right). In the MCS of complex characters, we put some emphasis on using structural vignettes and positional morphology aspects.

On the I)BMS driven prototypes, surface","recontiguralion of the base is made possible, using in turn","Ixlth multicriterial search or direct character collecting.

The leluner might","here express, discover, refine, some personal discovery","'customs' according to a cognitive style.","Both types of users are thus allowed (with appropriate access rights to such restructuriug resources) to enrich file collection of existing views on the property basE, to edit and to reshape predcfiued lessons or collections into 'personal lessons'.","Along with instant feedback and regular reviewing of tile actual work, the systenl here has some inccmivcs to more intention-driven, sell'guided learner activity, through sllort-tern~ session plmming and long-range curricnhmt self-organization. Case by case spontaneous consultatiou of lexical information is of course still advised. 3.3 Observing user activity","In our view such a function is essential on the way It1 inteq)reting and rot×lolling user activity.

We here aimed at exploring implementation paradigms for htrgcr scale character bases.","The system first configurates entities in an Oracle property base, while extracting relevant data from the llyperCard hypcrdocument fields. At query time, arguments sent from the interface layer will generate SQL requests. System response is displayed back to the user, who then collects characters for litter use, or directly picks up n~ded multimedia data on the properties sought.","~lhough on a still small scale prototype, the relatioual DBMS scheme cased data security, coherence qualities, as well as some quautitative devclopmeut aspects. 2~9 Towards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants... G. Fafiotte & F. Tcheou 4. EXPERT ASSISTANCE TO CItARACTER","IDENTIFICATION 4.1 Expert System oriented schemes","We prototyped a similar 'scale model' corpus into smidl knowledge bases (facts, structural aud other property rules), providing for deductive and explanatory fnuctious. Data-driven and goal-driven schemes were experimented in a small Expert Assistant for Character Identification.","We try to initiate more interactive multicritcrial searches, while coupling very discriminant semantic characteristics (the meanings of the expected character, of its semantic or phonetic keys), less selective indexiug (stroke number, pinyin...), with a tentative iconic specification of structural properties.","When efficient criteria ,are missing, we tbiuk such a visual structural recall to be helpful, with or without strong spatial positioning and applied to subcomponents with semantic or phonetic key functions, through a progressive opening or refinement of structural vignettes. 4.2 Cooperative search","Later the user should be able to express preferences regarding the prompting profile or the search strategies adopted by the Discovery Assistant (I)A) in cases of underspecified or possibly erroneous queries. The DA could group results or hints, in order to prevent overstepped talkative dialogues. System explanation, if activated, could justify or illustrate side-hints with details.","In the Annex example, the user tries to recall a ch~waeter ,~.,,, a morphological tree of which is shown below (the semantic keys of the subcomponents being squared) ---but he actually knows very little of all this.","~ z~a~utb Fig 7: A morphological tree for the character ILLUMINATI~","A first scenario (see the Annex) exemplifies a cooperative dialogue with a beginner user whose spontaneous search strategy will favour visual structural characteristics (with no particular attention here to any phonetic unit in the churacter). The I)A repeatedly asks for any semantic recall of another compouent (a most diseriminant criterion), but the user decliues, lie is therefore asked and helped to visually refine the overall","finally I:~. structure, sucessively , ~ then , In a second scenario, the user soon proposes (at dialogue step 2) a component kmfe ( ~ ),which he figures to be present --and which really belongs to the investigated character. With the current kauji base, adding this very discriminant element directly produces the unique final solution: to illuminate.","In a third scenario, the user erroneously recalls (at step 2) the possible presence of the radical strengh, ( ~ ), instead of the very similar knife radical. The system will first exhibit ,an empty respond, which is correct here. But knowing about this misleading similarity (a 'faux ,'mils' property), it then suggests chm~giug strength into knife. If","the user acknowledges the proposal, the proper character","to illuminate is reached right away.","5. A PROSPECTIVE VIEW","5.1 Functional development methodology In the context of our prototyping effort, we would like","ideally to design the application with a three-fold","functional architecture: a highly interactive interface layer developed on an appropriate authoriug environment, for tile surface multim(xlal representation of the lcxical lo:owlege, ,an object oriented DBMS to express the core of the structural knowledge, to implement efficieutly heavy data searching and to structure and update the user history profiles mid personid bases, a declarative or deductive progriunming environment or expert system generator, in order to express both the strategy m(xlels of a coached or error-compensatory multicritcrial character search, and first elements towards typed behavioural profiles and users' discovery strategies. This could possit)ly lead to 'client-server' m'chitectures","with distributed logical resources in the way of 'white-","board' schemes [8]. lit seems that the iutcropcrability","expected from multiplatform developmeut cnviroucmcnts","will further such luuctionally distributed design.","5.2 Cooperative adaptive accompanying interface To summarize, we intend to develop the first draft of","the exploration assistant, towards free surface resUucturing by the leander of his personal kuowledge base, according to a thematic or methodologic:d view he lkdlows, personal management---plauniug, monitoring and reviewing-- of sessions or iuquiry sequences, synthetic or analytical follow-up of the discovery, working on a metaphor of the subbase bciug explored, with qualitative indicators on the actual navigation, productiou (according to user preferences) of session journals, profile status, global cun'iculum surveys, issuing of persoualized written, magnetic or audio documents, for remediation and iu-depth work.","5.3 Towards integrated polymorphic or multiple-view Lexical Knowledge Bases Our system can be viewed as a facet of a broader","'environment for an encyclop:edic discovery' with other","mcxles of activity: sell-review, semi-tutored lessons, where","character thematic 'collections' would drive the discovery. It would be desirable to be able to find, througb","different views, in one and the same knowledge base, all the information that the I Ialperu Japanese-English dictionary [7] offers, with the words built from clmraeters, Japanese pronunciation, a sound thesaun~s, the data of a large 'Chiuesc-usual language' dictionary, character etymology [ 10], classical, usual calligrapby, a language-independent view of the hanzi / kanji, angmented with a progressive and comprehensive proposal of mnemonics in lteisig's style [7], but culturally related to tile user's native or usual language, the resources and mod:dities modelled in the AAOCC prototypes, for accompanied hyperdocumental navigation, expert character identification, for the creation and updating of pe~onal subbases or thematic character collections, among other features to appear. 290 7bwards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants...
