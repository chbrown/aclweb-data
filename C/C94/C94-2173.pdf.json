Pattern matching systems for English texts are reported to be suits,hie tor achieving a high level of per[brmance with less effort, compared to full parsing architectures[Hobbs et al. 92]. Among seventeen systems presented in the Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5), three systems used a pattern marcher a.s the main component for identifying patterns to be extracted [MUC-5 93]. A pattern matching architecture is appropriate for information extraction fi-om texts in narrow domains since identifying informatkm does not necessarily re-quire full understa.nding of the text.

The first step in pattern ln~tching is a concept searvh applied in the TI';XTRACT system of the TIPSTER Japanese microelectronics and corporate .joint ventures domains{aacobs 93a], [aacobs 93b]. In this step, key words representing a concept are searched for within a sentence. The second step is a. template pattern sea~rh applied in the TEXTRACT joint ventures system. A complex pattern to be searched for usually consists of a few words and phrases, inste~d of just one word, as in the concept search. The template pattern search recognizes relationships between matched objects in the defined pattern a.s well a.s recognizing the. concept itself.","l,'rom the viewpoints of system perfof mance and portalfility across domains, the TIPS'I.'I~;II/MUC-5 evaluatioll J'esults suggest that pattern nta.tching described in this paper is all appropriate architecture for information extraction from ,lapanese texts."]},{"title":"2 TIPSTER/MUC-5 OVERVIEW","paragraphs":["The goal of the TI1)STER/MUC-5 project sponsored by ARPA is to capture information of interest from English and .lal)aJmse newspal)er artMes about microelectronics and corpora.re joint ventures. 1 A system must fill a. generic template with information taken","1Several Al{PA-sponsored sites f¢)rmed tile TIP-ST]'21/informal|on extraclion project. \"['he TIPSTER sites and other non-sponsored organizations participated in MUC-5. 1064 fronl the text its. a fully automated fa.shion.

The concept search module recognizes the concept when a word in the fist exists in tile sentence. Using such a simple word list sometilnes generates an incorrect concept. For example, a dissolved concept is erroneously identiffed fl'om an expression \"cancel a hotel reservation\". IIowever, when processing text in a. narrow <lomain, concepts are often i<lentiffe<t correctly fi'om the simple list, since key words are usually used in a particular meaning of interest in the domain.","During the Ja.panese segmentation process in the preprocessor, a key word in the text tends to be divided into a few separate words"]},{"title":"by MAJESTY,","paragraphs":["when the word is not stored in the dictionary, For example, the compound noun \"~jJ'~f~\" consists of two words, \"i~3 '' (joint venture) and \":r#~b1\" (dissolve). It is segmented into the two individual nouns using the current MAJESTY dictionary. Thus, when the compound word \"~.-~jlf(t'-fb] '' is searched for in the segmented sentence, the concept search fails to identify it. To avoid this segmentation problein, adjacent nouns are automatically put together during the concept search process.","This process al]ows, by defanlt, partial word matching between a key word and a word in the text. Therefore, \"~.-~j\" and \"~05 {~J\" both meaning \"a .joint venture\" can be identitied by a single key word \"~.'I~,Y'. Ilowever, due to the nature of partial matching, the key word \"-.:/~ = :/\" (Silicon) matches \"-iL~. 4[:: \"5+ ~ = :/\" (Silicon dioxide), which is a different type of ffhn reported in the microelectronies domain. This undesirable behavior can be avoided by attaching \">\" to the beginning or \"<\" to the end of key words. Thus, ,,> .3.1) :~ :/ <,, tells the matcher that it requires an exact word matching against a word in the text. 4.2 Template pattern search 4.2.1 Template pattern matcher","The teml>late pattern matcher identifies typical expressions to be extracted from the text that frequently aplmar in the corpus. The patterns are defined as pa.ttern matching rules using regular expressions.","The pattern matcher is a ffnite-state automaton sinfilar to the pattern recognizer use.d in the MUC-4 FASTUS system developed at SRI [I[obbs et al. 92]. /n TEXTRACT, state transitions arc driven by segmented words or grouped units fi'om the prei)rocessor.

Partial string matching is useful when compound words must be matched to a defined pattern.

(The key word list is shown in Section 4.11.) After sentence-level processing, discourse processing recognizes that \"X\" in the second sentence is a reference to \"X Inc.\" found in the first sentence. Thus, the \"DISSOLVI';I)\" concept is joined to the, joint venture relationship between \"X inc.\" and \"Y Corp.\". in this way, TI!iXTRACT recognizes that the two companies dissolved the ,joint venture.","SupI)ose that the second sentence is re-place(t with another sentence: \"Shortly after, X terminated a contract to supply rice to Z Corp.\". Although it does not mentiot~ the dissolved relationship nor anything a hottt \"Y Corp.\", the system incorrectly recognizes the dissolved joint ventttre rela.tionship between \"X In('.\" and \"V Corp.\" due to the existence of the word terminate.
