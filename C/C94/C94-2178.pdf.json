Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product. We present an alternative alignment strategy which we call K-vec, that starts by estimating the lexicon. For example, it discovers that the English word fisheries is similar to the French p~ches by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of p~ches in the French. K-vec does not depend on sentence boundaries. 1. Motivation There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al (1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al (1993), Dagan et al (1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al (1992), Warwick-Armstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear). Most of this work has been focused on European language pairs, especially English-French. It remains an open question how well these methods might generalize to other language pairs, especially pairs such as English-Japanese and English-Chinese. In previous work (Church et al, 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using charalign (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target. The charalign method was designed for European language pairs, where cognates often share character sequences, e.g., government and gouvernement. In general, this approach doesn't work between languages such as English and Japanese which are written in different alphabets. The AWK manual happens to contain a large number of examples and technical words that are the same in the English source and target Japanese. It remains an open question how we might be able to align a broader class of texts, especially those that are written in different character sets and share relatively few character sequences. The K-vec method attempts to address this question. 2. The K-vec Algorithm K-vec starts by estimating the lexicon. Consider the example: fisheries --~ p~ches. The K-vec algorithm will discover this fact by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of p~ches in the French. The concordances for fisheries and p~ches are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of this paper). 1","1. These tables were computed from a small fragment of the Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al (1992).

For this work, we set K to the square root of the size of the corpus. K should be thought of as a scale parameter.
