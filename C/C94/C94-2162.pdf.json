Scrambling can pose both sever(', linguistic and cornpurational ditficulties for naturM language parsers. This paper describes how these problems are dealt with in a Principles-and-I)aran3eters-based parser. Japanese, at first glance, seems to permit fMrly-free permutation of objects: (I) Short distance (Vl'-internal) scrambling","Ca) aohn-ga Mary-n! kono hon-o ageta (koto) t John gave this book to Mary (b) ,Iohn-ga kono hon-o Mary-n! ageta (koto) (2) Short (or medium)distance scrambling to IP (at) Mary-ga John-n! sono hon-o watasita (koto) Mary handed that book to John"]},{"title":"(b)","paragraphs":["SOIl() hon-o John-n!

The goM is to produce an a nMysis of scrambling that works for different languages and a wider variety of examples wilhou! introducing new machinery. The essential idea is to rely on the same (universal) constraints and parsing algorithms Mready in place for non-scramhling languages, e.g. English. [n other words, we adopt the null hypothesis. So, we be-gin with a comImtationally-rnodelh:d linguistic framework that is already capable of handling scrambling as the dedm-tive result of interactions of basic principles, such as general movement (Move-c 0 with Binding theory. The point is that scrambling (like the so-called i asmv ; and \"dative\" constructions) obeys the same i:estrictions ah'eady showu to be operative for other syntactic phenomena, and so shoukl follow from in-","1 (Salt, o, 1992) remarks that ko to %he fact. that' is often added to avoid the unuagurahless resulting fl'om not having a topic in the main'ix clause.","2It was brought t,o lny attention by Doug Jones (personM coinmunlcation), l, hat German is normally considered to have only short, distance scrambling for technical reasons.

Scrambling is always to the left. 2. Empty NPs don't scramble. Again, judging from the data, these appear to be no restriction all.

State 1: (End) Skip until see an NP gap, halt. Note this is potentially inefficient since the NV constraint is only checked when the LtUmachine completes the RHS of a rule, i.e. when it completes an IP or VP phrase.

Con,- paring the two algorithms on 50 Japanese sentences (25 scrambling examples) fi'om (Saito, 1985) & (Lasnik & Saito, 1984), an average speed-up factor of 2.3 per sentence and a total of 3.2 over the 50 sentences was observed for the second algorithm over just the phrase structure recovery portion. Due to the varying effects from the participation of other principh'.s, the improvement for the total parsing time was le.ss clearcut, generally varying between no speed-up at all l;o a factor of two depending on the sentence. Using the 25 non-scrambling examples fl'om the test set, an additional experiment hetween two variants of the parser, one with and one without the ability to handle scram bling, showed that the ability to handle scrambling exacts a penalty of about 30 50% in total parsing time, In conclusion, given tit(; pertlaps disproportionate el'- feet of scrambling on parsing time, we suggest that although scrambling comes virtually for free linguistically speaking, the same certainly does not N)pear to be the case for computation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["2'.
