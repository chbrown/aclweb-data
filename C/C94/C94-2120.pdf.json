In recent years psycholinguistic evidence for incremental interpretation has become more and more compelling, suggesting that humans perlTorm semantic interpretation before constituent boundaries, possibly word by word. However, possible computational applications have received less attention. In this paper we consider various potential applications, in particular graphical interaction and dialogue. We then review the theoretical and computational tools available for mapping from fragments of sentences to flflly scoped semantic representations. Finally, we tease apart the relationship between dynamic semantics and in-creinental interpretation. APPLICATIONS Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson (1973), .lust and Carpenter (1980) and Altma.nn al]d Steedrnan (1988), it has heroine widely accepted that semantic i11terpretation in hnman sentence processing can occur beibre sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries. It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation in computational applications.","In the [970s and early 1980s several compntational implementations motivated the use of' incremental in-. terpretation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity (a survey is given in Haddock 1989). A sentence snch as the following has 4862 different syntactic parses due solely to attachment ambiguity (Stabler 1991).","1) I put the bouquet of flowers that you gave me for Mothers' Day in the vase that you gave me for my birthday on the chest of drawers that you gave me lbr Armistice Day. Although some of the parses can be ruled out using structural preferences during parsing (such as [,ate C'losure or Minimal Attachment (Frazier 1979)), ex traction of the correct set of plausible readings requires use of real world knowledge. Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic tiltering, i.e. parses of initial fragments which have an implausible or an-olnalous interpretation are rqiected, thereby preven-","*'.lPhis research was supported by the UK Science and Gnglneerlng l~.esearch Council, H, esearch Grant 1tR30718. Ling ambiguities from multiplying as the parse proceeds.","However, onqine semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks. Firstly, for sentence processing using a serial architecture (rather than one in which syntactic and semantic processing is perforlned in parallel), the savings in computation obtained from on-line filtering have to be balanced against the additional costs of performing selnan~ic computations for parses of fl:agments which would eventually be ruled out anyway from purely syntactic considerations. Moreow~r, there are now relatively sophisticated ways of packing ambiguities during parsing (e.g. by the nse of graph-structured stacks and packed parse forests (2blnita 1985)). Secondly, the task of judging plausibility or anomaly according to context and real world knowledge is a difficult problem, except in some very lilnited domains. It, contrast, statistical techniqnes using lexeme co-occurrence provide a relatively simple mechanism which can imitate semantic filtering in many cases. 1,br example, instead of judging bank as a lhmncial institution as more plansible than bank as a riverbank in the noun phrase the rich bank, we can cornpare the number of co-occurrences of the lexemcs rich and bank1 (= riverbank) versus rich and bank2 (= financial institution) in a semantically analysed corpus. Cases where statistical techniques seem less appropriate arc where plausibility is affected by local context. For example, consider the ambiguous sentence, The decorators painted a wall with cracks in tim two contexts 517~c room was supposed to look\" rundown vs. The clients couhln't afford wallpaper. Such cases involve reasoning with an interpretation in its immediate context, as opposed to purely .judging the likelihood of a particular linguistic expression in a given application domain (see e.g. Cooper 1993 for discussion). Although the usefulness of on-line semantic filtering during the processing of complete sentences is debatable, filtering has a more plausible role to play in interactive, real-time environments, such as interactive spell checkers (see e.g. Wirdn (1990) I'or arguments for incremental parsing in such environnlents). IIere the choice is between whether or not to have semantic ill-tering at all, rather than whether to do it on-line, or at the end of the sentence. q'he concentration in early literature on using incremental interpretation for semantic filtering has perha.ps distracted f'roln SOlne other applications which provide less controversial applications.

For example, incomplete parsers have been proposed by Stabler (11991) and Moortga.t (1988). Stabler's system is a simple top-down parser which does not deal with left recursive grammars. Moortgat's M-Systeln is based on the Lambek (~ah:ulus: the problem of an infinite lmmber of possible tree ka.gments is replaced by a corresponding problem of initiM fl:agments having an infinite number of possible types. A colnplete incremental parser, which is not fully word by word, was proposed by Pullnan (1986). This is ba.~ sed on arc-eager left-corner parsing (see e.g. l{esnik","To elmbIe complete, fully word by word parsing re quires a way of encoding an intinite nmnber of partiM l, rees. There are several possibilities. 'Fhe first is to use a language describing trees where we can express the fact that ,]ohn is donfinatcd by the suode, but do not have to speciiy what it. is ilmnediately dominated by (e.g. D-Theory, Marcus et ah 198a). Semantic representations could be tbrmed word by word by ex-tracting 'default' syntax trees (by strengthening dominance links into immediated dominance links wherever possible).","A second possibility is to factor out recursive structures from a grammar. Thompson et al. (1991) show how this can be done for a phrase structure grammar (creating an equivalent 'Pree Adjoining (;rammar (,Ioshi I987)). The parser for the resulting grammar allows linear parsing tbr an (infinitely) parallel system, with Cite absorption of each word performed in constant time. At each choice point, there are only a finite number of possible new partial TAG trees (the TAG trees represents the possibly inlinite nmnbet of trees which can be forlned using adjunct|on). It should agMn be possible to extract 'default' semantic values, by taking the semantics from the TA(I tree (i.e. by assuming that there are to be ,to adj unctions). A somewhat similar system has recently been proposed by Shieber and Johnson (191t3). The third possibility is suggested by considering the semantic representations which are appropria.te during a word by word parse. Although there are any number of dill'trent partial trees for the fragment Mary thinks John, the semautics of the fragment can be represented using just two lambda expressions6: AP. thinks(mary,I)(john)) AP.

Given tile illtuitive evidence, our hypothesis is that scope preferences can sometimes be established early, befbre the end ofa sentence. This leaves open the possibility that in other cases, where the scoping inIbrmation is not particularly of interest to the hearer, preferences are determined late, if at all. 3.1 Increlnental Quantifier Scoping: hnplelnent, ation Dealing with quantifiers incrementally is a rather simila.r problem to dealing with h'aglnents of trees incrementally, a,st as it is in-,possible to predict the level of embedding of ~r noun phrase such as John from tile fragment Mary thinL's John, it is also impossible to predict the scope of a quantifier in a fragment with respect ~o the arbitrarily large number of quantiliers which might appear later in the sentence. Again the problem can be avoided by a tbrm of pacldng. A particularly simple way of doing this is to use unseoped logical forms where qmmtifiers are left in situ (silnilar to the representations used by Hobbs and Shieber (1987), or to Quasi Logical Form (Alshawi 1990)). For example, the fl'agment Every man gives a boot\" can be given the tbllowing representation: I1) kz.gives(< V,x,nlan(x)>,< ~,y,book(y)>,z) Each qnantitied term consists of' a quantitier, a va.riable and a restrictor, but, no body. To convert lambda expressions to unscoped propositions, we replace an occurrence of each argument with an empty existentia.l quantitier term. In this case we obtain: 12) gives(< V,X,ITIall(X)>,< 3,y,book(y)>,< -~,z,'l'>) Scoped propositions can then be obtained by using an outside-in quantifier scoping algorithm (Lewin, 1990), or an inside-out algorithm with a free w~riable constraint (IIobbs and Shieber, 1987). The propositions fbrlncd can then be judged for plausibility.","To imitate jungle path phenomena, these pla.usi o bility judgements need to feed back into the scoping procedure for the next fragment. For example, if' every man is taken to be scoped outside a book after processing the fragment l?vcry man ga~c. a book, [;hen this preference should be preserved when deterlnining the scope for the full sentence l?very uza~t gave a book lo a child. Thus instead of doing ~dl quantitier scoping at the end of the sentence, each new quantilier is scoped relative to the existing quantifiers (and operators such as negation, intensional verbs etc.). A preliminary irnplemenl, ation achieves this by annotating the semantic representations with node nantes, a.nd recording which quantifiers are 'discharged' at. which nodes, and in which order. DYNAMIC SEMANTICS l)ynamic semantics adopts the view that \"the mea-- ning of a sentence does not lie ill its truth conditions, but rather in the way ill which it changes (tile representation of) the in[brmation of the intcrl)reter\" (Groencndijk and Stokho[', ] 991). At first glance such a. view seems ideally suited t.o incremental interpretation. Indeed, Groenendijk and Stokhof claim that the compositional nature o[' l)ynamic Predicate Logic enables one to \"interpret a text ir~ an on-line ntauner, i.e., incrementally, processing a.nd interpreting each basic unit as it comes along, in the context created by the interpretation of the t.ext so fa.r'.","Putting these two quotes together is, however, misleading, since it suggests a more direct mapping between incremental sem~mtics and dyna.mh: semantics than is actually possible. In an incremental semantics, we would expect the informtttiou state, of an interpreter to be updated word by word. In contrast, in dynamic semantics, the ol:der in which states are updated is determined by semantic st;ructure, not by left-to-right order (see e.g. I,ewiu, 1992 [br discussion). For example, in 1)ynanfic Predicate Logic ((~roenendijk ,~ Stokhof, 1991), states are threaded from the antecedent of a conditional into I, he conseque~d~, and from a restrictor of' a quantitier into I;he body. Thus, in interpreting,"]},{"title":"13)","paragraphs":["John will buy it right away, if a car impresses him the input state for evMuation of .John will bug it right away is the output state from the a.ntecedent a ear hnp,vsses hhn. in this ease the threading through semantic structure is in the opposite order to the order in which the two clauses appear in the sentence.","Some intuitive justification for the direction of threading in dynamic semantics is provided by cousidering appropriate orders for evaluation of propositions against a database: the natural order in which 752 l,o cvMual;e a, conditiona,1 is first, 1,o add the antecedenl;, illl([ thell see if I.he COllSC(lUOlll, c{i.ll 17c: l)roveli. ]to is ()lily ai, tile sentence lew;l iu ,siniple na,rrative texLs 0ha,t I,he l)l;esenl;al, ion ordor itlld I,ho iw, l, ur~d order o[ 4\"wahl3J;ion necx~s,<sarily coincide.","The orderhig of a,n~tl)hors and theii: autel:edent, s is o[l;en used inl'orinMly/,o jusl,ify lefl,-l,o-riglll; i, hreadiug or thi:eadilig through selllaait, ic sl;rtlC(,llrO, llowew',r, (,]iroa(lingj fl;Olll ]el'[,-to-righ{ disa,llows cX;/llllJlcs (3]\" Ol) (;tonal c;d;aphoi;a,, as ill example (1'3), mid examI)les o[' c:oiilpll|sory c,a.l;a,p}lora, a,s ill : 14) I lesitle her> every girl could see a, large cl:acl~ Sitnihu:ly, l;]irei~ding li'oin the aui;ccedeui,s o1' conditio-- ua, lS into t;he COllSl'x[llOll[; fails f'()r (!X31ill)JeS sHCh &s:","15) EVC'L'y boy will be a.I)lc t,(i s(!(', olLi, <)[' a window il he walll;s I,() I{, is also 1)ossilTle l;o gel; ,SOli{,ellCCS with <([Olil,:cy' rea,dhlgs, })ill; whei:c the inde[inil;c is hi I, hc conseqllOlil,:","[6) A 81,11de, tit wilt a, tteud the COli['creliCe it' we C(~II ~2~(]0 l;ogei,hoi: enough lliOli(?y [or her air [are This ,qCli[;OliCO ,q(!oHis [;o g(;1L, ;i, reading where we aro liOt, lalking &l)ollb it particul~u' sl0tl(i()tll, (~/11 O[IL(H' exist, on 0ial), or ~d)Olil; i~ typic~d stu(]cul, (a geiloric, reading).

CONCLUSIONS The paper described some potential applications 0]7 incremental interpretation. It then described the series of steps required in mapping fi'Oln initial fragments of sentences to propositions which can I)e judged for plausibility. I,'inally, it argued that the apparently close relationship between the states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold I)elt)w the sentence level, and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in increinental interpretation.
