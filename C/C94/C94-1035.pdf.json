Introduction","There are two linguistic phenomena that are interested in Ihe processing of computational morphology. They are morphological transformation and morpheme identification. Two-level model and syllable--based formalism focussed on the problem of morl)hological h'ansformntion IBear88, Cahig0, Kosk83]. Morpheme identification is an importmlt issue in some languages where two or more morphemes ave combined to make a word, a compound word, or a sentence without any delimiters between morphemes [Abe86, Chen92, Paeh92].","The goal of morphological analysis is to find the base form of morphemes in a word. It consists of a generation of analysis candidates and the selection of ton'cot candidates. Analysis candidates are generated as a reverse process of word formation rules'. morpheme isolation and morphological transformation. Then, correct candidates are selected by the coherence restrictions among Yung Taek KiIn Dept. of Computer Engineerin,q Sc~ul National University Seoul 15l-742, Korea adjacent morphelnes and dictionary confirnmtion. The morphological mmlyzer tries to generate all the possible candidates only to accept the correct candidates. 2. The l)roblem","Two.-level model is widely known to be n eomputationnlly efficient method for the practical system on the condition thai the munber of rules is smnll[Bart86, Kosk88]. Howew.w, when the size of the rulebase is large it causes an exponential probleln. In case of the Korean langttage, it is common that a stenl is succeeded by I,,rammatical n~orphemes. If we use the twe-level model for a practical sys/eln, a small set of phonological rules and a large set of rnorl)helne isolation rules are required because there are several thousand colnbinalion.~ of grammatical morphemes[Zhan90].","in order to solve the problem, we can try a 2--pass algorithm. All the l)OS,~ible morl)hemes are isolated, and then do a phonological processing. It is also l~ossil)le to do a phonological processing first and morphemes are isolated at the second Imss. [iowever, this Mad of solution causes m~olller Selious problem that o(;eut+s l'totll the conditional resh'ie{ions: (1) ,,:eme morphologieal transformation occurs not only at a stem but also at a functional inorpheme, (2) there are eooccurrenee restrictions between two morl)hemes, (3) morphological tl'ansfovlnat[oll OCCtll'S only for the El)e.cinl word grotlp. 3. Syllable-based writing system","The writina system for most languaffes i,~; based on tile letter set called as alphabet. Instead of' a letter se, t, Chinese writing 221 system is based on the set of characters that consists of one or more letters. Each character is a meaning unit and words are represented by the combination of characters. In case of Korean, words are represented by one or more characters as in Chinese. The difference is that Korean character is a well-formed written syllable, which is a sound unit rather than a meaning unit as in Chinese. A written syllable is a combination of two or three sound symbols, which corresponds to a spoken syllable in a one-to-one fashion[Chun90]. Korean words are constructed as follows based on the syllable unit. word ::= { syllable )\" syllable ::= open_syll I closed syll open_syll ::= initial + medial closed_syll ::= initial + medial + final"]},{"title":"4. Idiosynehratic features of syllable","paragraphs":["There are 11,172 syllables in the modern Korean language( = 19 initials * 21 medials * 27 finals plus one for null). However, it is i,)teresting to investigate the usage of syllables to make a word. About 2,350 syllables cover more than 99.9% of the modern Korean words. Furthermore, 267 syllables(11.36% of 2,350 syllables) are only used for the surface form of verbs, and grammatical morphemes are combinations of 151 syllables(6.43% of 2,350 syllables). In addition, only a very small set of syllables, 1 to 46 syllables for each type of irregular verbs, are tied to the morphological transformation [Kang93]. This ldnct of information is very useful to improve Ihe efficiency of the morphological mmlyzer. For example, if a syllable used only for the surface form of verb is found in a word, we can easily guess that the word is a verb, the string before that syllable is a stem, and the rest is a grammatical morpheme. There is no other chance for the different result except typographic errors.","Suppose that X is a set of syllables that are used at the first position of grammatical morphemes. We can easily guess the syllable boundary position of grammatical morpheme in an n-syllable word at syllable .v~, where xj"]},{"title":"X and i","paragraphs":[":~ j K n. There is no the possibility at other positions. It is based on the fact that only 48 syllables are used for the first position of postl)ositions and 72 syllables for the first position of final endings in the Korean language.","Three Idnds of syllable features are defined from where the features are extracted. 'Unit feature' is a syllable featm'e defined on the syllable itself. If a syllable xi itself has an idiosynchratic feature J], then xi has a unit feature g. 'Partial feature' is defined by the component of a syllable. A syllable xi is called to have a pm'tial feature 1)~, if xi includes a component 1)~, as an initial, a medial, or a final letter. 'Successive featlwe' is a mete-level feature defined for the adjacent two syllable features. For example, if there is a set of two successive syllables xixi,l that construct grammatical morphemes and that cannot construct any noun/verb, then the boundary position of a grammatk.'al morpheme is possible only at syllable xi or Xi~ 1. 5. Characteristic function","Idiosynchratie features of syllables are represented using a characteristic set of syllables. Suppose that a part of speech(i), morpheme length(j), and the position of syllable in a word(k) are discriminating features of a characteristic set. I.et IPi be a set of syllables that are used for a part of speech i, ()j be q sol: of syllables Ihal are used for the morpheme length j, and ~k be a set of syllables that are used for the k-th l)osition of syllable in the word. \"['hen, a characteristic set of syllables A<i,j,k> is an intersection of Pi, {~j, and ~l{.

[Definition] characteristic function Let X be a set of Korean syllables and A<id, k> be a characteristic set of syllables 222 where A<ij,k> ~ X for pm't of sI)eech i, morpheme length j, and the k-th position of morpheme.

Conclusion","Syllable-based formalism is proposed to solve the problem of morphological alternation with morpheme isolation where many candidates are generated by tile phonological rules. It improved the worst--time complexity O(n) to a constant, and tim nulnber of dictionary accesses is highly reduced using tile syllable features that are extracted froin words and formalized to be available for a morphological analyzer. They are very useftfl for the isolation of morphemes, which make it possible to guess the boundary position of a stem without accessing the dictionary. They are also useful to reject the implausible base forms from a w~rb.","Charaeterislic set of syllables and syllable-lmsed formalism may be applied for lhe languages whose words consists of syllables and morphological operation is described as a syllable- to-syllable transformation to increase tile performance of tile morphological analyzer.
