IDItS (Intelligent Dictionary lielp System) is conceived as a monolingual (explanatory) dictionary system for hum,'m use (Artola & Evrard, 92). The fact that it is intended for people instead of automatic processing distiuguishes it from other systems dealing with semantic knowledge acquisition from conventional dictiouaries, ql~e system provides various access possibilities to the data, allowing to deduce implicit knowledge from the explicit dictionary information. IDIIS deals with reasoning mechanisms analogous to those used by humans when they consult a dictionary. User level functionality of the system has been defined ,'rod is partially hnplementcd.","q'he starting point of IDIIS is a Dictionary Database (DDB) built from an ordinary French dictionary. Meaning definitions have been analysed using linguistic information from the DDB itself and interpreted to be structured ,as a Dictionary Knowledge Base (DKB). As a result of the parsing, different lexical-semantic relations between word senses are established by means of semantic rules (attached to the patterns); this rules are used for the initial construction of the DKB.","This paper describes tile knowledge rcprcsentatiou model adopted in IDIIS to represent the lexical knowledge acquired from the source dictionary. Once the acquisition process has been performed and the I)KB built, some enrichment processes have becn executed on the I)KB in order to enhance its knowledge about the words in the language. Besides, the dynamic exploitatiou of this knowledge is made possible by means of specially conceived deduction mechanisms. Both the enrichment processes and the dynamic deduction mechanisms are based on the exploitation of the properties of the lexical semantic relations represented in the DKB.","In the following section an overview of II)IIS is given. Section 3 briefly presents the process of construction of the DKB. The knowledge representation model and the enrichmeut mechanisms are fully described in sections 4 and 5. Section 6 describes some inferential aspects of the system. Finally, in section 7, some figures about the size of tile prototype built are presented. 2 TIIE IDIIS DICTIONARY SYSTEM. IDIIS is a dictionary help system iuteuded to assist a human user in hulguage comprehension or production tasks. The system provides a set of functions that have been inspired by the different reasoning processes a human user performs when consulting a conventional dictionary, such as definition queries, search of alternative definitions, differences, relations and analogies between concepts, thesaurus-like word search, verification of concept properties and interconceptual relationships, etc. (Arregi et at., 91).","II)IIS can bc seen as a repository of dictionary knowledge apt to be accessed and exploited in several ways. The system has been implemented on a symbolic architecture machiue using KEE knowledge engineering environment.","Two plmscs are distinguished in the construction of tile DKB. Firstly, information containcd in the DDB is used to produce an initi,-d DKB. General information about the cntries obtained from the DDB (POS, usage, examples, etc.) is conventionally represented --attribute-value pairs in thc frame structure-- while the semantic component of the dictionary, i.e. the definition scntenees, has been analysed and represented as an interrelated set of concepts. In this stage the relations established between concepts could still be, in some cases, of lexical-syntactic nature. In a sccond phase, the semantic knowledge acquisition process is complcted using for that the relations established in the initial DKB. The purpose of this phase is to perform lcxical and syntactical disambiguation, showing that semantic knowledge about hierarchical relations between concepts c,'ul be determinant for this. 3 BUILDING TIlE DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE BASE. 'File starting point of this system is a small monoliugual French dictionary (Le Plus Petit Larousse, Paris: Librairie Larousse, 1980) consisting of nearly 23,000 senses related to almost 16,000 entries. The dictionary was recorded in a relational database: the Dictionary Database (DDB). This DDB is the basis of every empirical study that has been developed in order to design the final model proposed for representation and intelligent exploitation of the dictionary.","The definition sentences have been analysed in the process of transformation of tbe data contained in the DDB to produce the DKB. The analysis mechanism used is based on hierarchies of phrasal patterns (Alshawi, 89). The semantic structure associated to each analysis pattern is expressed by means of a Semantic Structure Construction Rule (SSCR). The 544 prncess oF construction of the I)KB is automatic and based on these SSCR's (Artola, 93).","The intcrconcelmml lexical-semantic relations delcclcd li'om Ihe analysis of the source dictionary are classified into paradigmatic and synlagmatic...Mnong the paradigmatic rclalions, the followiug have bccn found: sylu)uy~ny au(l antonymy, laxonomic relalions as hyperuymy/hyponymy --obtained from definitions of type \"gcnt,s et differenlia\"--, aud taxonymy itself (expressed by nlcaus of specific relators such as sorte de aad espbce de), mcronymy, and others as gradation (for adjectives and verbs), equiwdcnce (between adjectives and past pmticiplc), factitive and rcllexivc (for verbs), lack and reference (to the previous sense). Whereas among the synlagmalic relations, i.e. those thai relate concepls belonging to different POS's, derivation is the most important, I)ut also relationships bctweell concepts without auy morphological relation its case relations, attributivc (for verbs), lack and couforlllily have Ix3eil dclccle(l,","The hierarchies created have already been used to parse all Ihe noun, verb, and adjective definitions in the ])l)B.

In tim KB-TIIESAURUS, some of the links representing lexicat-semmltic relations are created when buildiug Ihe initial version of the knowledge base, while others are deduced later by means of specially conceived deduction mechauisms. When a dictionary entry like spatule I I: aerie de cuiller plate (a kind of flat Sl)Oon) is treated, new concept unils arc created in KB-TIII';SAURUS (aud subsidiarily iu KB-DICTIONAR.Y) and linked to olhers previously included in il. l)uc to the ellct:l of these links new wflucs lot some l)roperlies arc propagaled flmmgh the resulliug taxonomy. ~-- KB'S'fRUCTURI~'S LKII .STRUC ( I I R E-~4 .... i",".~- .......

The classification of conceptual units under this last","class is as follows:","• TYPE-CONCEPTS correspond to Quillian's (1968) \"type nodes\"; this class is, in fact, like a supcrclass under which every concept of KB-TIII2SAURUS is placed. It is fi~rthcr subdivided in the classes ENTITII'?.S, ACTIONS/F.VF.NTS, Q[JALITIES and STAq'ES, that classify different types of concepts.","• PIIRASAL-CONCEPTS is a class that includes concepts similar to Quilliau's \"tokens\" .--occurrences of type concepts in the delinitio,i scnlcnccs--. Phrasal concepts ,'u'e the representation of phrase stn~ctures which are composed by several concepts with semantic content. A phrasal couccpt is always built as a subclass of the class which ,cpresents its head (the nouu of a noun phrase, the verb of a verb phrase, and so on), and integrated in the conceptual taxonomy. Phrasal concepts are classified into NOMINALS, VERBALS, A1)JFL;TIVALS, ~md AI)VERBIALS. For iustance,' Iplaute I 1#31 is a phrasal concept (see Fig. 2), subclass of the type concept Iplaute I 11, and represents the noun phrase \"une plante d'ornement\".","• Finally, the concepts that, after the analysis phase, are not yet completely disambiguated (lexical ambignity), are placed under the class AMBIGUOUS-CONCEIrFS, which is further subdivided into the subclasses IIOMOGRAPIIE (e.g. Ifacult6 ? ?1), SENSE (IpanserI ?1), and COMPLEX (Idouner I 5/61), in order to distinguish them according to the level of ambiguity they present. The links between units iu KB-TIII]SAURUS and","KB-DICTIONARY are implemented by means of slots","tagged with the n,'une of the link they represent. These","slots are defined in the different classes of KB-","STI~.UC~I'URI:S. The representation model used in the system is","made up of two levels:","• Definitory level, where the surface representation of the definition of each sense is made. Morphosyntactic features like verb mode, dine, determination, etc. arc represented by means of faeets attached to the attributes. The defiuitory level is implemented using representational attributes. Examples of this kiud of attributes are: DEF-SORTI:D, 1) t'.\" F-QUI, CARACTERISTIQUE and AVEC.","o Relational level, that rellccts the relational view of the lexicon. It supports the deductive behaviour of the system and is made up by means of relational attributes, that may eventu,'dly contain deduced knowledge. These attributes, defined in the class TYPE-CONCEPTS, are the implementation of the iuterconceptual relations: ANTONYMES, AGENT, CARACTI~.RISTIQUE, SORTI:.-I)E, CE-QUI, etc. 4.2 KB-I)ICT1ONARY: from words to COliCepl,',;. This knowledge base represents the links between each dictionary entry and its senses (see link 4 in Fig. 1). 4.3 KB-TIIESAURUS: the concept network.

In this section tim cnrichment processes accomplished on the DKB are explained. Two phases are dislinguished: (a) the enrichment obtained during the construction of the initial DKB, and (b), where different tasks concerning mainly tim exploitation of the properties of synonymy and taxonymy have been performed. 5.1 Enrichment obtained during the construction of the initial I)KB. KB-TIIESAURUS itself, represented --as a network--- at the relational level, can be considered an enrichment of the definitory level becanse, while the DKB was built, tim following processes have been performed: . Values coming from file definiiory k;vel have been promotcd to the relational level. • Values coming from the nnit which represents the tiefiniens havt: been transferred to the corresponding definiendum unit. The maintcnancc of the relations in both directions has been antomalically guamntccd. • \"Ille concepts included in REFERENCES have becn directly related to other concepts. The taxonomy of coneepls has bccn made explicit, thus obtaining wduc iuhcritanee. 5.2 Second phase in tile enrichment of the DKB, Several processes have tmeu carried out in order to infer new facts to be asserted in tile DKB 2. \"lhe enrichment obtained in this phase concerns tim two follt)wing aspects: o Exploitation of the properties of the synonylny","(symmetric and transitive). * Enlargement of the concept taxonomy based on","synonymy.","Another aspect that has been considered to be exploitexl in this phase is that of disambiguation, qhe use of the lexical-sentantic knowledge about hierarchical relations contained in the DKB can be detcnninant in order to reduce tim level of lexical and syntactical ambiguity 3. lleuristics based on the taxonomic and synonymic knowledge obtained previously have been considered in tiffs phase. Some of them have been designed, implemented and cwlluatcd in a sample of the DKB. 2 By tnear~s of rules fired following a forward chaining strategy. 3 Lexical ambiguity comes from tile definitions themselves; syntactical ambiguity is due lroinly to the anadysis process, 548 6 INFERENTIAl, ASPECTS: DYNAMIC DEDUCTION OF KNOWLEI)GE. I)ynalnie acquisition of knowlcdgc deals with the knowledge not explicitly represented ill the 1)KB aqd captured by means of especially conceived mechanisms which ,arc aelivaled when thc system is to answer a question posed by the user (Arregi et al., 91). Thc lollowing ,aspect,,; ,'u'e considered: • Inheritance (concept taxouomy).","Composition o1 lexic~d relations.","Links bctweeu concepts and relations: users are","allowed to use actual concepts to denote","relationships (and not only primitive rclatious). . Anlbiguity ill file DKB: trealnlent of reraaining","imccrlainty.","In the following, some aspects couccnliug to Ihe secoud point will be discusscd.","lu IDIIS, Ihe relationships atnoug the diffcrenl lcxical-semautic relations can be easily expressed in a declarative way. It is tile way of expressing these ,elationships that is cMled Ihc composition of lexical relations. From an operative poiat of view, this mechanism permits the dyuamic exploitation --under Ihc user's requests--- nf Ihe tnopcrties of Ihe lexical relations in a direct maturer. It is, in fact, a way of acquiring iml)licit knowledge Ii'om II,c DKB.","The declarative aspect of the mcchanism is based on the definilion of triples: each llil)le expresses a relationship among difli'.reut lcxical-scmanlic relations. These Iriples have thr, form (R l R 2 R3), where R i represcnls a lexical rehdiou 4. The opel alive eflgct of these declarations is Ihe dynalnic crealiou of Irausitivity rules based on the triples stated.
