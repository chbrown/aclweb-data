The notion of universal guides also offers a new framework in which both parsing and generation can be viewed merely as two different instances of the same generic process: guide consumption. This technique generalizes and exemplifies a new and original use of an existing concept of \"proper guides\" recently proposed in literature for controlling top-down left-to-right (TDLR) execution in logic progrmns. We show that universal guides are independent of a particular grammar evaluation strategy. Also, unlike proper guides they can be specified in the same mmmer for any given algorithm without knowing in advance whether the algorithm is a parsing or a generation algorithm. Their introduction into a grammar prevents as well the occurrence of certain grammar rules an infinite number of times dnring a derivation process.","1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION This research interacted with a Japanese-English machine translation project at New York University. The results reported herein are part of an attempt to establish an evaluation system for grammar processing algorithms (parsing and generation algorithms). The need for evaluation of various competing approaches presently available lbr parser and generator design has been felt strongly in both Theoretical and Computational 1,inguistics. Both fields have been thus fat predominantly empMcal, so that the measuring of actual progress has become very difficult, l lere, we introduce the notion of universal guides in order to discuss two of the most relevant criteria tot the comparison of different parsing and generation algorithms: finiteness aml symmetry. Other criteria such as completeness, soundness, efficiency, etc., although equally significant and interesting, are outside of the scope of this paper and are addressed in [M92]. There is a natural appeal to the problem of characterizing parsing and generation within the same fl'amework and in a symmetrical way. The reversibility is by its nature symmetrical: parsing is retrieving a semantic content fiom a phonological one, and generation, a phonological from a semantic content. Several papers ([$88], [N89], [SNMP89], [DI88], [DI90], and [DIP90]) have recognized parsing and generation as instances of a single paradigm and have pointed out the correspondence between certain parsing problems and techniques (left-recursion, linking, Early deduction) and their correlates in generation. It has also been long noticed that adopting a certain technique for a derNation process can lead to termination problems (sometimes referred to as infinite derivations). Perhaps the best known example of this is using the TDLR derivation lor left-recursive rules. Consequently, to specify conditions on grammars, whose liflfillment is necessary and stffficient to guarantee finite derivations under a given evaluation strategy, posed another problem, one that has been given serious attention recently ([D90], [I)lP90]). These conditions are usually referred to as the finiteness criteria and are often given in the form of sufficient though not necessary conditions (\"worst case\" analysis of the finiteness of an algorithm). What we propose here is to abstract the notion of string index in parsing to the notion of a universal guide. A similar proposal was made in [DIPg0] for guides (here called proper guides to distinguish them fiom univetwal guides). Using the new concept, both parsing and generation call be seen as two instances of the same generic process: universal guide consmnption. Universal guides prove to be more general than proper guides because they can be used under any evaluation strategy and not only under TDLR technique as must proper guides. They achieve symmetry in treating parsing and generation but need not be instantiated difl'erently in either case, unlike proper guides. Universal guides can be consnmed anywhere during a derivation, as opposed to proper guides which may be consumed only by the application of lexical rules, therefore restricting the class of grammars for which they can be used. Moreover, we show here that proper guides can be viewed as a special case of our universal guides concept. The introduction of universal guides into a grammar also prevents the infinite repetition of certain grammar rules (i.e. those that do not instantiate any grammar variable and cause infinite loops).","2. PRIOR RELATED WORK Some of the most significant findings with respect to characterizing finiteness and symmetry of gratnmar processing algorithms have been published by [)ymetman, lsabelle and Perrault in [D1P90]. The authors pointed out the symmetrical nature of parsing and generation by introducing the notion of (proper) guides. A guide structure is a partially ordered set G that respects the descending chain condition, i.e. the condition that in (3 all 916 strictly decreasing chaius (1~ >l[>...>li>.,. ) are finite. Guides were introduced lilt() each of a logic gralllnlar's llon-tcrlllinals in the fOlill ell: IleW, SO called guide variables. These variables added SOlllC redundal/cy which could be exploited for tighter control of the computational process. Aller the guide wuiablcs were added and left recursion was eliminated (by perlbrming the usual trallslbrmation as indicated in [I)IP901), the creation of a IICW gl'allllllaf, equivalent lo the original one, was completed. Then, a set of conditions was specified that, if the now gIanllnal' satisfied it, guaranteed a finite deriwition lor any given goal. The conditions are: tile guide coilstullplion condition (GCC) alid the no-clmin condition (Nee). The guide coi]stnnption condition states that the wthies for guide wu'iablcs must initially he finite and must also be consumed (decreased) each time a lexical predicate is expanded. The no-chain condition prohihits tile exclusive appearance el:predicates like 7' 4/ on tile right-hand side of a rule. It was shown that if both (iCC altd NCC held, all derivations ill the gl-allllllal' would lie finite. The notion of guides is applicable Io both parsing and generation btit it is instantiated difl{Jrently in each case (for parsing, the guide wiriablc rcprcscuts file list of words awaitiug to he allalyzed, aild fbr generation, the list of seniantics of subcalegorizcd constituents lonmining to be generated). Tile authors of I I)lPg01 also denlonstrated all application of their main result to the chiss of lexical gl'all/lllars. The following inqJrovcments look desirable with respect to the maiil result from 11)11>901: (i) The guides should bc specified bolero the details o1 Ihe algoritlun (parsin!.,> or gelleration) alld lhc underlying glallllllal\" (lexical or other kind) arc awfilablc.

When a rule to be expanded (partially or completely) instantiates some variables (rules (2) and (3) in the previous example), the guide's set component is reduced by those variables and the guide's numeric component is reset to p (the number of rules in the grammar). On the other hand, when a rule does not instantiate any variable, the set component stays unchanged and the numeric component is decreased by one (rule (1)). The numeric component actually counts (down) the number of consecutive occurrences of rules that do not instantiate may variable. If that number is larger than the total number of rules in the grammar (p), then a grammar rule must have been repeated in its unchanged form, and a potentially infinite derivation is caught. Such a rule is always failed. For example, np --> np pp rule will in a TDLR derivation cause an infinite loop. However, adding universal guides to it will always, when this rule is applied, decrease the guide's numeric component by one (as no variable gets instantiated). Since the numeric component is always initialized and reset (after a rule that instantiates some variable(s)) to 9 (number of rules in the grammar), it will eventually go down to 0, which in turn will fail this rule, as in the following sequence: np(Vars,p) --> np(Vars,p- 1) pp(Vars,p- 1) --> np(Vars,p-2) pp(Vars,p-2)pp(Vars,p-l) --> np(Vars,p-3) pp(Vars,p-3)pp(Vars,p-2)pp(Vars, p- l) --> np(Vars,0) pp(Vars,0)pp(Vars, I) ... pp(Vars,p- 1) --> fail. All details (additional arguments for original predicates, additional predicates, transformation of the original rules into equivalent ones containing guides) of the procedure tbr introducing universal guides into a grammar and their handling can be lound in [M92]. Thus, the universal guide structure is represented in the new grammar by the pairs (Unln,Num) which stand for the set of all currently uninstantiated variables and the numeric guide's component, respectively. The new grammar is equivalent to the original one. By the introduction of an additional grammar predicate at the end of each rule (called decrease in [M92]) the guide consumption condition is demonstrated to hold for any finite and complete derivation. If a variable gets bound then the guide gets stricUy smaller because the set of still uninstantiated variables participating in the derivation has lost one member. If no variabie gets instantiated, the decrease of the number component is there to ensure that the guide itself strictly decreases (by the definition 3.2.). By failing, this new (decrease) predicate will stop any derivation that contains a sequence of more than p consecutive applications of rules that do not instantiate any variable (because the further decrease of the guide's numeric component would make it negative). Otherwise, a production rule would be repeated in the same manner without instantiating any of the present variables which would in turn cause an infinite derivation to take place. Thus, because of the way the universal guides are introduced for any derivation in the new grammar, guide consumption condition holds. The difference between finite and infinite derivations is isolated and solely characterized by the set component of the universal guides being either finite or infinite initially. The following theorem establishes a correlation between proper and universal guides. Theorem 3.1.: lfthere is a proper guide structure for a class of logic grammars (in its form flom [DIP90]) satisfying guide consumption and no-chain conditions (GCC and NCC) under the TDLR grammar evaluation algorithm, then the universal guide structure (under the same algorithm) is a proper guide structure satisfying both GCC and NCC. Proof The existence of the proper guides satisfying GCC and NCC nnder the TDLR algorithm guarantees that all derivations will be finite for the given class of grammars (main theorem from [DIP90]). Since the derivations are finite, the universal guides will initially assume a finite value (its set component will be set to all variables taking part in the derivation and its number component will be assigned value p (number of different production rules in the grammar). The universal guides are defined to always satisfy the guide consumption condition, and since NCC is assnmed as well, it only remains to show that the descending 918 chain condition is respected. As every strictly descending chain of universal guides with a finite initial value must be finite (moreover, we know lhat its length is always less than or equal to p*u (u being number of variables taking part in the derivation), the universal guide structure has all properties of a proper guide structure,, Thus, whenever proper guides can be used to establish the finiteness of an algorithm, the universal guides approach may likewise be used. Also, tile notion of universal guides proves to be more general than the notion of guides in the sense that it does not asstane any partictflar algorithm under which a grammar will be processed. It is applicable to any algorithm, and to apply it would mean to specify conditions on gtammars thal would (for a given algorithm) guarantee finiteness of tile forclnentioncd sets (set components of the universal guides). Of conrse, the character of tile conditions will ctepcnd oll tile nature of tile gtamtnar processing algorithm. Proper guicles as proposed by I)ymetman, ct al. guarantee finiteness el:one specific (TI)I,R) algorithm if the grammar satisfies GCC and NCC.

The proof of this theorem as well as a detailed specification of how to introduce tmiversal guides into a grammar can be found in [M92]. Moreover, the common essence of tim parsing and generation process as merely different instances of the stone generic process of consuming the universal guides becomes obvious after making the appearance of universal guides explicit. Universal guide variables do not necessarily have different meaning for\" parsing and generation as do proper guides. Even under an evaluation strategy (TDLR) assumed in advance proper guides (as in the case of lexical grammar> floln [DIP90]) represent difterenl entities for parsing and generation. For a parsing algorithm guides are difference lists of words remaining to be analyzed, and for' a generation they are lists of subcategorized semantics to be generated next. Unlike proper guides, universal guides exposed the common substance of the two processes. They are always (for parsing as well as for generation) instantiated as sets of all currently uninstantiated variables. Another feature of the univcrsal guides that gives them an advantage over proper guides is that they do not impose the restriction that the guides can be consnmed only at the level of lexical predicates. Thus, the class of grammars lbr which this approach can be used is broader than for that of proper guides.
