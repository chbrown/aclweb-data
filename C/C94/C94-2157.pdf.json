Diphones are structured as [bllows: *V, *C, g*, C*, CV, VC, CO, gV where * is a silence, C a consonant, and V a vowel. Semi vowels were treated in the same fash-ion as consonants. Diphones were recorded following two (lif[erent strategies: the first one consisted of picking existing words from a dictionary list. The second consisted of deciding on a neutral phonetic context in using logatornes or non-existing words. Logatomes are phonotactiically well-formed strings, which do not exist as words in the current French language.","2.1.2 Selection of existing words from machine-readable dictionary A word list was extracted from a subset of the Robert French dictionary [?] and the pronunciation fields were extracted. The dictionary contains almost 89,000 entries, of which 85,796 entries con-Lain a headword, a phonemic transcription, and a part of speech. The remaining entries are prefixes and suffixes. The first task consisted of convert-ing and mapping the dictionary phonemic symbols to the ones adopted in our system (shown in table 1). This was not straightforward since there was not always a one-to-one mapping between the two sets. For handling symbol mapping, a program was written that converts any set of characters to any other set of characters I. The program is developed so that characters coded in octal or decimal code not only can he translated in either code, but also can be input in ascii format for being converted 2","Quite often, there was more than one pronunciation in the phonetic field and the. pattern match-ing program chose the pronunciation corresponding to the one required. Moreover, dictionary pro-","11 am very grateflfl to Mike Tanenblatt who wrote this program and made a succession of changes until complete flexibility of character conversion was obtained.","2 This tool allowed the conversion of databases originally written on Macintosh, PC, or Unix. Additionally, we used it to convert all the French textual databases into latin1 8 bit encoding format. nouneiation fields are often not phonetically linegrained enough for acceptable speech output (see"]},{"title":"[?]","paragraphs":["for a discussion on machine-readable dictionaries in text-to-speech systems). Finally, due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nouns and adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of the entries were extracted during dictionary lookup. Sirnilarly for verbs, only the infinil;iwd forms were used since the dictionary does not list the intleeted forms as headwords. A program was written to search through the dictionary pronunciation field and select the longest word where the phonenm pairs would be in mid-syllable position in order to avoid the extraction of' phonemes occuring at the beginning or end of words. In this way, l, he influence of lexicM stress was reduced. The orthography/prommciation pair [headword_orth, headwordq~)hon] was extracted and headword_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording. Out of 1225 original phonemic pairs, 874 words wet'{'. found with at least one occurence of the pair. Be cause 1225 is the number of all phonemic pairs in French whether they are allowed or not, it is interesting to notice that only 874 pairs occur within real words in the Robert dictionary. 2.1.3 Selection of logatomes"]},{"title":"For the logato.tes, two phonen,es /a/ attd /t/ were","paragraphs":["used to encompass the selected diphone, since they appear to be fairly stable from a phonetic-acousLic standpoint.

Nonetheless, these R)rms were generated and used since they were necessary for interword phenomena. Approximately 1225 words were constructed following the ab ow~' model. 978","l{.esearchers disagree as to whether to use logatomes or real words for synthesis. The argmnent for using logatomcs is that it is t)etter to collect non-real words so that the diphone ix recorded as neutrally as possible and does uot undergo any real word stress. Those against argue thai; the ([iphone is ov(~r-articulated in a logatome environment and that it reduces l, he naturahmss of the synthesized sl)eech.

Speech synthesis for French brings a variety of chalh!nges, some of which are specific to French, such as nasalization, liaison, schwa realization, etc. and some of which are more general issues, such as vowel hmgthen= ing, prosodic cont, ouring, and intonation. Several systems are. in exp<!rin|e|d;al stages for other languages, such as Spanish (Castilian as well as South Ame.ri<'ar0, Italian, Chinese, Navajo, German, aud Russian. Once C, ontinental French is eomph'.ted, 981 we also intend to build a TTS system for Canadian French."]},{"title":"References [1]","paragraphs":["Veronique Aul)ergd."]},{"title":"La synth~se de la parole: 'des r@les aux lezique'.","paragraphs":["I'M) thesis, (lniversitd de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, 1991."]},{"title":"[2]","paragraphs":["Jared 11ernstein.
