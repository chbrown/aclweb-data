We would like to thank all members of the NLP groul), and in particular Iatl Johnson and Pete Whitelock, for helpful comments and advice. transitive verb such as move to yield either a movement or psychological interpretation ean be generalized to most predicates of caused motion (e.g. agitate, crash, cross, lift, slrike, sweep, unwind) with the causer col responding to the stimulus argument and the theme to the experieneer. Similarly, the option of either a noun or verb phrase complement for enjoy can be extended to many other psychological verbs with experiencer subjects (e.g. hale, like, lnvfeO, and verbs of undirected motion in English (e.g. carry, drive, float, push, run, swim, walk) can subcategorize for an expression of completed path so as to yield a telic/directed interpretation (Tahny, 1985; Sanfilippo el al., 1992; Sanfilippo, 11994). Moreover, the metonymical and metaphoric processes which are responsible for sense/usage extcnsious appear to be sul)ject to crosslinguistic variatiou. For example, the \"meat vs. animal\" alternatkm that is found in English -- viz. feed lh.e lamb vs. eal lamb -- is absent in Eskimo (Nunberg &. Zaencn, 1992) as well as in l)utch where nominal compomlding is used instead -. e.g. lain vs. lamvlees (Copestake & Saniilippo, 1993).","Exanrples of this sort show that our ability to exteud word use in context is often systematic or conventiom alized. As Pustejovsky and Boguraev (1993) point out, traditional approaches to lexical representation assume that word use extensibility can be modeled by exhaustively describiug the meaning of a word through closed enumeration of its senses: each sense corresponds to a predefined context. This practice has largely characterized the compilation of dictionary entries in the texicographic tradition and has consequently iniluenced the shape of comlmtational lexicons since the large scale construction of such lexicons has typically in-volved semiautomatic knowledge acquisition from machine readable dictionaries (Carroll & Grover, 1989).","Word sense enumeration provides highly specialized lexical entries, but • it fails to make explicit regularities about word sense","cxtensibility which are necessary in promoting com-","pactedness in lexical description, ® it is at odds with our ability to create new word uses","in novel contexts, and • it generates massive lexic~d ambiguity.

For example a verb such ;m want whMt can be used as either a transitive (want a beer), subject equi (w.nt to .sleep) or object raising w'xb (want Mary to sleep) will only produce a single chart edge when followed by a VP complement, e.g. (6) 1% derivation([wmlt,to,sleep]).","0 want 1 to 2 sleep 3","0 ......... t .........","\"2. .................... 3 ......... 4 ....................................","With simple structures i~s the one in (6), the edwin|age ill using i)olynaorphic lexical types with sort resolution ~s comparexl to word sense euumeration by lexical disjnnction is minimal even though fewer chart edges are built.

Such a measure is needed, R)r example, when a w.'rb with l)olymorl)hie type undergoes morphological combination before the head-complement rule el)plies. In this clme, the semantics of the verb wouhl be altered with a consequent loss of the original (polymorphie) lexical type. This wouht make lexical type resohttion impossible.

In the lexicon, briu9 is assigned the polymorl)hie. type tv_or_tv_obl_or..ditrans_syns(,.m which subsumes the tlu'ee uses of tim verb exemplified in (2): tv..synsem in (2a), tv._old__(litrans synsem in (2b), and ditrans syns(;m in"]},{"title":"lab).","paragraphs":["Because the three subtypes are consistent with a direct object subcategorizalion, z-ec_restr±cts Callnot provide a unique solution when parsing bring with a nouu l)hrase complement. This is l)eeause, rec_restr±cts carries out sort resolution of a I)olymorphic type by elmcking consistency of 699 the discriminating constraint against all minimal (most specific) subtypes of the polymorphie type. Consequently, tee_restricts would return three solutions for bring using the instantiation for the head of the compllst to np_synsem, as would the use of generalized recursive constraint resolution. In our approach, however, this inadequacy can be easily redressed by • changing rec_res~ricts so that sort resohltion is","done by returning the maximal (least specific) sub-","type of the input polymorphic type at which the","discriminating constraint is introduced, and • modifying the grammar so as to support such a","change. 1 As long as the same constraint is not introduced at several subtypes for each polymorphic type to be solved, these changes will ensure that sort resolution by tee_restricts is always deterministic. 4 Conclusion If the computational analysis of natural language is to approach the ease with which language users manage the contextual determination of word usage, an approach to lexical ambiguity is needed which capitalizes on the regularity of sense extensions to avoid undiscriminated generation of word uses during sentencc processing. Our proposal to achieve this objective is to use lexical polymorphism with deterministic contextual sort resolution within a type feature structure formalism. Such a proposal is based on the intuition that for each class of lexieal ambiguity there is a word substructure whose increnmntal instautiation provides sufficient discriminating information to select a unique solntion. We have shown how a first implementation of such an approach can be realized for the domain of verbal diatheses and envisaged how further refinements can be carried out to arrive at a fidl specification. Although it is too early to establish whether or not the approach can be made to handle all kinds of lexical ambiguity, initial results suggest that our treatment is effective, efficient and has natural applications in domains other than verbal diatheses.","References Atkins B. & B.
