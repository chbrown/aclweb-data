We. can divide the sources of error and inconsistency into four classes:","1. errors of classification: where an instance of a word is improperly analyzed, and in particular where the words following a verb are not properly identified with regard to complement type.

Our primary defenses against such errors have been a steady refinement of tile feature deseril)tions in ollr nlanlla] and rel';- ular grou I) review sessions with all the elves. Ill particular, we have developed detailed criteria for making adjunct/argument distinctiolis [O]. A 1)reliminary study, conducted on examples (drawn at random from a corpus not used for our concordance) of verbs beginning with \"j\", indicated that elves were consistent 93% to 94% of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinctions following our criteria and, in these eases, rarely disagreed on the subcategorization. In more than half of the cases where there was disagreethen(, the elves separately flagged these as drillcult, ambiguous, or figurative uses of the verbs (and therefore would probably not use them its the basis for assigning lexical features).

Acceptability, however, is often not absolute but a matter of degree. A verb may occur primarily with particular complements, but will be \"acceptable\" with others. This problem is eompmmded by words which take on particular features only in special contexts. Thus, we don't ordinarily think of \"dead\" as being gradable (*\"Fred is more dead than Mary.\"), but we do say \"deader than a door nail\". It is also compounded by our decision not to make sense distinctions initially. For examl)le, many words which are countable (require a determiner before the singular form) also have a generic sense in which the determiner is not required (*\"Fred bought apple.\" but \"Apple is a wonderflfl flavor.\"). For each such problematic feature we have prepared gnidelines for the elves, but these still require considerable discretion on their part.
