Morcovcr, there arc good reasons to include pictures in refcrring acts. l'icturcs effectively convey discriminating object properties such as surface atlributes and shape. If au object can only be discriminated against alternatives through ils location, a picture may provide the spatted context of the object. Since depictions arc explicit material representations of the world objects to which they correspond, new attributes of the type 'being dcpicted as ...' arc iutroducc(l which, in ttlrn, provide an additiomd source for object discriminatiou (e.g., the knob which is reprcscnlcd by thc black circle ...). Last but not least, several graphical focusing tcchniqucs can bc applied to effcctivcly constraiu the set of alternatives (c.g., arrows, blinking). Unfortunately, there is also a dark side of the picture. An obvious drawback is that pictures do not provide for syutactical devices to distinguish between a reference-specifying and a predication-specifying part since objects and their properties are hardly separable once depict \"cd. Auothcr difliculty is that pictures lack the means to distinguish deliuitc from indefinite descriptions. Thus, it may remain unclear whcthcr a particular object or whether ~m ,-u-biUzu-y exemplary of a class is depicted. The conclusion we can draw from these considerations is that it often makes sensc to employ bofll text lind pictures when rcfcrriug to domain objects. Pictures may be used in order to simplify verbal reference expressions. On the other hand, ambiguitics of pictures cau be rcsolvcd by providing additional information throngh text.

Rcprcscnlations can bc act)wiled by textual descriptions, by graphical descriptions or by mixed descriptions. Whereas the order in which representations are activated by a text is ittlhmtlccd by the discourse structure, it is less than clear ill which order a picture activates representations.

The user is assumed to look at the espresso machine aud to see two switches. Let rl_u and r3_u corresl×md to iutenml reprcscnlatious of the switches which Ihe user builds up when looking at tim machine. We assume that tile user idso knows of the existeuce of the on/off switch and file temperature control, but is not able to localize them. l.et r2_u and r4_u be the user's representations for tile temperature control and the on/off switch. \"l lie fact that he o)lly knows that one of tile switches lie sccs must be the temperature control and the other file on/oil switch can be expressed by metals of a disjunction. Either a corer ,elation holds between rl_u and r2_u and between r3_u aud r4_u or conversely, between rl_u and r4_u and be~ twecu r3_u and r2_u. The couucctiou between the system's rcprcscnlations rl_s and r3_s to tim rcpresentalious tile user is assumed to have. is also expressed by corelizreuce relations. 2.2 Reln'esent:dion of Descriptions As nmntioncd ill section 1, descriptions can be co;nlx)stal 531 of text, graphics mid further presenUUion media. To cope with such descriptions, we associate with each syntactical unit (depictions, noun phrases, etc.) the set of objcct rcpreseutations which will be activated by that particular part. The referent of tile whole description is then considered as a member of thc intersection of all sets resulting from partial descriptions.","An important prerequisite of our approach is that the system explicitly represents how it has encoded in formation in a presentation. Inspired by (Mackinlay, 1986), we use a relation tuplc of tim form: (Encodes nwans itlformation context-slmce) to specify tim semantic relationship Imtwccn a textual or graphical means, and tim inh)rmatiou tim means is to convey in a cerladn context space. In our approach, the third argulnent refers to tile context space to which the encoding relation corresponds R~ and not to a graphical language as in Mackinlay's al~proach. This enables us to use one and the same presentation means differently in different context spaces. For example, a depiction of an csprcsso machine may refer to an individual machine in one context space, but may serve as a prototypical representative of an espresso machine in mmthcr. In addition, we not only specify encoding relations bctwccn individual objccls, but ~dso specify encoding relations on a generic level (e.g., that tile property of being red in a picture encodes tile property of being defect iu tile world).","While it can be assumed that a user reads a text in sequeutial order, it is often not clear at which times a user looks at a picture. ThercR)re, it makes not ,'always sense to further distinguish between an mlaphor and its antecedent. Fortunately, our approach does not require identi lying parts of a presentation as anaphora and antecedents. It suffices to recognize which parts of a description ~u'e intended to encode a uniquely determined object. ~Ib express such cohesive relationships between presentation parts p 1 and p2, we define the predicate:","(EncodesSame pl p2 c) : =","(Exists w (And (Encodes pl w c) (Encodes 1)2 w c)","(Forall v (Implies (Or (Encodes plv c) (Encodes p2 v c))","(Coref w v))))) The first part of this dcfiuition expresses that there exists an object w thai pl and p2 encode in tile context space c while the second part means that this object w is uniquely determined. 2.3 Links between Representations and Descriptions In uuderstanding a referring expression, the user has to recognize certain links between actiwttcd mental representations, between descriptions and mental representations, and between textual and graphic,'d parts of dcscriptions. Which links are present in a description and which have to be inferred varies from sifimtiou to situation. To illustrate this, let's have a look at a case study carried ot, t in our espresso machine domaiu where text-picture combinations are used to explain how to operate an espresso machiuc. We assume that tile user is rexlUested to tunl the temperature control of an espresso machine. In this case, identification means actiwtting a representation the user builds up when localizing the referent in his visual field. Furthermore, we presume tile user knowledge of the espresso machine as in Scction 2.1; i.e., file user knows of the existence of tile on/off~ and the temperature control, has visual access to tile two switches in the world but is not able to tell them apart. In the diagrams below, we use the abbreviations ES, C aud E for die relations EncodesSame, Coref and Eucodes respectively.","In tile document fragment shown in Fig. 2, the textual rcfcrcncc expression uniquely determines a referent, but activates a reprcscutation (r2_u) which docsn't contain any information to localize rile referent. Colwersely, the representations activated by tim picture contain locative information, but here we have the problem that several objcct representations arc activated to tile siune extent. Since only the prope,ty of being a switch, but not tile property of being a temperature control is conveyed by the picture, both switch depictions become possible as antecedents of the textual referring expression. ? ? lhe temperal.re ~ E ~ control Figure 2: Missing Cohesive Liuk between Text and Picture","In Fig. 3, tile verbal descriptiou discriminates tim referent from its alternatives by attributes of the world object, umncly 'being a switch', and 'being depicted in tile figure' and an attribute of the depiction, namely 'being dark'. But, in contrast to tim previous example, only one of the representations activated by the picture fits tim verbal descriplion. \"llius, the user should be able to discover the anaphoric link between the verbal description and the graphical depiction and activate an appropriate representation. the dark switch '.~ r2~u Figure 3: Establishing a Cohesive Liuk by Incorporating Picture Attributes in Vcrbal Descriptions","In tile previous example, an anaphoric link between text and picture has been established by including pictorial attributes in the vcrbal descriptiou. All altcrnative is to apply graphical focusing tcclmiqucs ,as in Fig. 4. Ilere, it's vcry likely that the user will be able to draw a link between text mid picture because he will assume that the pictorial ,'rod the textual focus cx)incide. This ex~unple also illustrates how tile user's knowledge of rile identity of objects cml be enriched by means of a referring act. The verbal 532 descripthm without the graphics and tim graphical dcpicthin witimut the text actiwtte different reprcseatalions of tim switch. When coasidering bolh text and graphics, tim user will conclude timt they refer to tile same object.

This DAG rellecls rellccls lhe proposithmal contents of the potcnti;d document paris, Ihe intcntkmal gems behind tim parts as well as tim rhetoric~d relationships between them, lot details see (Andr6 and Rist, 1993). While tim top of the presenlalion plan is a more or less complex presentation goal (e.g., instrucling tim user in switching on a device), the lowest level is formed by specilications of elementary presentatioa lasks (e.g., formulating a r~lucst or depicting an object). These elementary tasks m'e directly forwardcxl to tim mcdium-spccilic generators, currcntly for text (Kilgel, 1994) aud graphics (Rist, and Andr6, 1992).","\"llm contcut of referring expressions is determined by Ihe presentation planucr Ihat Mso decides which representations should be actiwttcd and which medium should be chosen for tiffs. \"lb be able to pcrlbnn these steps, we need presentation slrategics for linking propositional acts with activation acts.
