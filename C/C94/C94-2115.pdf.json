Specifically, the authors have developed a multimodal drawing tool. The multimodal drawing tool allows users to draw pictures by using multiple modalities; mouse, keyboard and voice input, in various combined ways.","Recently, most user interfaces tend to be based on a direct manipulation method. However the direct manipulation method is not always better than other ways. The direct manipulation method is not particularly applicable, when mentioning several operations together and operating an object which is not displayed. Also, it compels a user to point to a target object correctly with a pointing device. On the other hand, voice inputs have some advantages, since a user can feel free to speak at any time, and the user can use the voice input while simultaneously using other devices. A combination of such different modalities offers an interface which is easy for the user to use.","Many multimodal systems, which integrate natural language inputs and pointing inputs, have been developed [2][1][5][4]. In those systems, tbe user uses natural language mainly supported by the pointing inputs. However, when the user has to communicate with the computer frequently, in such a system as drawing tool, it is ,lot effective for the user to always speak while working.","A prototype system for a multimodal drawing tool has been developed, whereby the user can use voice inputs unrestrainedly and effectively, that is, the user can choose a modality unrestrainedly, and can use the voice inputs only when the user wants to do so. Ill such a system, input data come ill at random with multiple modalities. Tile multimodal system must be able to handle such several kinds of input data."]},{"title":"2 Multimodal Inputs in Drawing Tools","paragraphs":["This section describes requirements to develop general drawing interfaces. In existing drawing tools, a mouse is a major input device. In addition, some drawing tools assign functions to some keys on a keyboard to reduce inconvenience in menu operations. Issues regarding such interfaces are as follows:","• It is troublesome to input a function. Because a user uses a mouse, both to select a menu and to draw a figure, tile user has to move a cursor many times from a menu area to a canvas on which figures are placed.","• It is troublesome to look for a menu item. In proportion to increasing functions increment, menu items also increase. So, it becomes increasing-ly difficult to look for a specific objective menu item.","• It is troublesome to continuously move a hand from a mouse to a keyboard.","• It is not possible to express plural requirements simultaneously. For example, when a user wants to delete plural figure objects, the user has to choose the objects one by one.","• The user has to point to an object correctly. For example, when the user wants to choose a line object on a display, the user has to move a cursor just above the line and click the mouse button. If the point shifts slightly, the object is not selected.","By adding voice input functions to such an input environmeut, it becomes possible to solve these first 722 three issues. That is, by means of operation with the voice input, a user can concentrate on drawing, and menu search and any labor required by changing dee vices becomes unnecessary.","t, br overcoming the rest of these issues, more con-it*vance is needed. The authors attempted to develop a mull*modal drawing tool, operable with both voice inlmts and pointing inputs, which has tire following time*ions.","• A user can choose a modality (lUOHSe or voice) unrestrainedly, which means that the user can use the voice inputs only when the user wants to do so. Also, the user can use both modal*ties in various comhiued wws. For example, the user says \"this\", while pointing to one of several objects.","• Plural requests can be e×pressed simultaneously ( ex. \"change the (-ok)r of all line objects to green\"). So, the operation elticiency will be im-1)roved.","• A user can shorten voice inputs (ex. \"n,ove here\") or omit mouse i)ointing events b,%sed on the situation, if the omitted concepts are able to be inferred l¥om eoute×t. For example, the. user can utter \"this\", as a reference for previously operated objects, without a mouse pointing.","• Ambiguous pointings are possible. When a user wants to choose an object ['rein ~;uliollg those on a display, tire nser can indicate it rouglfly with a brief desrription, using the voice input. For ex.. aml)le , a user points at a spot near a target object and utters"]},{"title":"\"line\",","paragraphs":["whc'reby the nearest \"line\" obje.ct to the spot in selected. Or, a us(;,' points at objects piled n I) and says \"circle\", then only the \"circle\" objects among the piled /,t1 objects are selected.","'lb realize these time*ions, it in necessary to solve the following new problems.","1. Matching pointing inputs with voice inputs. hr tire proposed sysi.em, since pointing events may olteu occur independently, it is difficult to judge wtmther or not an event is at* independent input or whethe.r it follows a related voice input. So, an interpretation wherein the voice input and pointing event are connected in the order of arrival is not sufficient [4]. Therefore, a pointing event shouht be basically handled as an independent event. Then, the event is picked out from input history afl, erward, when the sys~ tern judges that the event relates to the li)llowing voice input.","2. Solving several input data ambiguities. in the l)revious mouse based system, ambiguous inputs do not o<'.cur, because tim system requires that a user selects menus and target objects e~- plieitly and exactly. F, ven if the voice inl)ut function in added in such a system~ it is possible to if)roe the user to give a detailed verbal sequence for the operation without ambiguity. However, when the time*ion becomes more sopltisticated, it is dilficult for the user to outline the user's in-tention in detail verbally. So, it is necessary to be able to interpret the ambiguous user's input.","Several multimodal systems have been developed to solve these problems. For example, Hayes [4] pro posed the first issue to be addressed, but the definite solution was not addressed. ()()hen [3] presented a solution for the first issue, by utilizing context. However, the solution is not sufficient for application to drawing tools, because it was presented only for query systems. The following section describes a prototype system for a multimodal drawing tool. Next, solutions for these problems are presented. 3 Multlmodal Drawing Tool 3.1 System Construction A l)rototype system for a nmltimodal drawing tool w~Ls develol)ed as a case study on a mull*modal coinmunicatiou system. Figure I shows a system image of the prototype system, by which the user draws l)ictures using mouse, keyboard and voice.

The system moves the circle object to the specified point.","• If a user wants to choose an existing line object among several objects one upon another, the user can say \"line\" while pointing at a point near the line object. The system chooses the nearest line object to the point.","• If the user wants to draw a red circle, the user can say \"red circle\". The system changes a current color mode to red and changes the drawing mode to the circle mode. 3.3 System Structure Figure 3 shows a prototype system structure. The system includes Mouse Input Handler, Keyboard Iu-put Handler, Voice input Handler, Drawing Tool and Input Integrator.","Each Input Handler receives mouse input events, keyboard input events and voice input events, and sends them to the Input Integrator.","The Input Integrator receives an input message from each input handler, then interprets the message, using voice scripts, which show voice input patterns and sequences of operations related to the patterns, as well as mouse scripts, which show mouse input patterns and sequences of operations. When the input data matches one of the input patterns in the scripts, the Input Integrator executes the sequence of operations related to the pattern. That is, the Input Integrator sends some messages to Drawing Tool to carry out the sequences of operations. If the input data matches a part of one of the input patterns in the scripts, tile Input Integrator waits for a next input. Then, a combination of previous input data 724 and the new input data is examined. Otherwise, the interpretation fails. The Input Integrator may refer to the Drawing Tool. For example, it refers to the Drawing 'reel for iirformation regarding an object at a specific position.","Tile Drawing Toot manages attributes for tignre objects and current status, such as color, size, line width, etc. Also, it executes drawing and editing tiperations, according to requests from the Input lutegrater, and it; sends the editing results to the Display Handler. The l)isplay Handler modilies the expression on the display. 4"]},{"title":"Multimode Data Interpretation","paragraphs":["This section describes in detail interpretation methods for tile multimodal inputs used in the drawing tool. 4.1"]},{"title":"Matching Pointing","paragraphs":["Inputs with Voice"]},{"title":"Inputs","paragraphs":["In conwmtional multimodal systems, all a,laphoric references in voice inputs bring about pointing inputs, and individual pointing input is connected to any anaphorie refi~renee.

Because a pointing event may often occur independently, when a l/ointing event does occur, the system cannot judge whe.ther tile event is an independent input or whether it follows the related voice input. Furthermore, tile user can utter \"this\", as reference to an object, operated immediately before tile utterance.

Such systems require a user to select menus and target objects and to edit the objects explicitly and exactly. Even if the voice input function is added in such a system, the user can be forced to utter operations without ambiguity. However, when the function becomes more sophisticated, it is difficult for the user to utter the user's intentions in detail. So, it is necessary to be able to interpret the user's ambiguous input. In a multimodal drawing tool, such our system, one of the most essential input ambiguities is led by ambiguous I)ointings.","l~br example, if a user says \"character string\", there are three possible interpretations: \"the user wants to edit one of the existing character strings\", \"the user wants to choose one of the existing character strings\" and \"the user wants to write a new character string\"","In this example, the system interprets using the following heuristic rules.","• If a pointing event does not exist immediately before, the system changes a drawing mode to the character string input mode.","• If a pointing event upon a string object exists just before the voice input, then the system adds the character string object to a current selection; a group of objects selected currently.","• When a pointing event exists immediately before the voice input and there is a character string object near the position of the user's point (ex. within a radius of five ram. fi'om the position), then the character string object is added to a current selection.","• When a pointing event exists and there is no character string object near the position, then the mode is changed to the character string input mode at the position.","Naturally, \"character string\" in these heuristics rules can be replaced by other figure types. If this heuristic rule is not perfect, the interpretation may be different from the user's intention. In such a case, it is important for a user to return from the error condition with minimum effort. For example, assume that a user, who wants to choose one of \"character string\" objects, says \"character string\" and points on the display, but the distance between the pointed position and the \"character string\" object is greater than the predefined threshold. Then, according to the above rules, the result of the system's interprcration will be to input a new character string at the position, and the drawing mode changes to the character string input mode. In this case, the user wishes to turn back to a state which the user intended with mininmm elfort. The system must return to the state in which tlle character string input mode is canceled and the nearest \"character string\" object is selected. A solution is for the user to utter \"select\" only. Then, the system understands that it's interpretation was wrong and interprets that \"select\" means \"select a character string object\" using current context."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["For implementing a multimodal system, based on direct nmnipulation system, tile system has to use not only pointing events concurrently with a voice input, but must also use the context, such as input history or information regarding the current operated object, ms information for binding to the voice input. Furthermore, it is important to solve any ambiguity in inputs. This paper discussed these problems, and described an interpretation nmthod using a drawing tool example. Furthermore, a prototype system for a multimodal drawing tool has been implemented. Much future work remains, but we believe that these elaborate interpretations may become bases of user fi.iendly multimodal interfaces.
