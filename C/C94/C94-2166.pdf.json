In view of the general decision to work with intermediate, semantic expressions the denotation of which is the answer to the NL questions, the basic types of complete expressions listed in Pig. 3 were found useful. In this figure 9~ stands for an arbitrary proposition in some logical language L. The e.xtension of L created by introducing these new types will be called L '.

This approach, however, does not meet the criteria set out above. To illustrate this, we basically rely on two observations Barwise &. Cooper (1981) made to show a fundamental difference in the natures of NL and PL. Their observations will be 'transposed' to the computational application at hand.","The first observation is illustrated in figure 4, which contains some Dutch questions attd their most natural PL' counterparts. Whereas the Dutch sentences have the same syntactic structure, their PL' counterparts have different formats. These and many other examples suggests that there is no trivially compositionM way of translating NL expressions to their nearest PL' equivalents. The problem is thai; the quantiticational information, which in NL has a fixed location, is spread over the PL' expression in a seemingly arbitrary way.
