Note that when specifying the parser I will kee t) the presentation as simple as possible, thereby deliberately ignoring efficiency aspects. I will also refrain from model;riga//aspccts of relevant knowledge in DL, i.e. there are still pieces of information which are not explicitly encoded in the DL modeling, but tire rather ;nil;licitly cnntained in lhe parser (e.g. information related to linear precedence and to traces}.","The main objective of this paper it thus neilher to contribute to research in efficient parsing tectmology, nor to","\"The project KIT-VM11 is suppo21ed by lhe German leedcral Minister of Research and Technology (BMFF) under conh'ac101 IV 101Q8. develop a declarative formalism ira which all aspects relevant for NI.P can be represented.

In Section 6 I will hriefly sketch how the l)L-based parser l)resenled in Section 5 can be exleuded to realize this approach. 2 ilasie Ideas An important distinction made in DI., but missing in traditionaI fealure formafisms, is the one between objects ;rod /)7)es. I)I. formulae eilher express that a type 1~ is more specific than (or subsumed by) a type t2 (tl :< t2) or that an object o is an instance of a type or, using I)I, terminology, a conce U (o :: c).","Applying Ibis schema to the task (5t\" NI,P, we can say that the objects in this donaain are wnrds or phrases, and that the types are syntactic categories. I:urthermore, given a phrase el we have addiliomll relations between lhis l)hrase and its constitnents 02, 03, ..., nsually expressed as \"02 is a daughter of ol\". In DL this ix modeled as '(or, 02):: dtrs', or equivalently as '01 :: dlrs:02'. 'dtrs' llltlS acts as a binary predicate or, using I)l. terminology, as a role. Nile thai roles can have more Ihan one value in contrast I(i fealures, which are funclional. We can thus write 'el :: dlrs:02 & dtrs:03'.","Note further Ih;lt the objects stand for occtJrrences of words or phrases, and thal different occtwrenees nf the slime word will be represenled by different objects. This is represented by writing 'o2 :: 15hen:or ', for example, It) express thai 02 is tin ocetlrrenee of Ihe form 'er'.","This is all rather similar R) standard Ill ,.~(; nil;ilion, and the main difference is Ihat in addition to the feature structures used in IIIHG, we add ;ill additional level of objects, which we see as instances nf the feature strueha'es. Fea-Itlre structures Ihus correspond Io types or more precisely Io l)I. concepts. In a way, IJle objects ill 1)L are used to make the lIPS(] feature slr(lchu'es]~cr, v[slcnt, i.e. 1(5 have pointers or names to refer to them.","The additional level of objects allows a slraighlforward description of the parsing task. We start with a nttmber of objects, namely words, whose phonological value amd position ix known. We want to end up with a single object containing till these words as (not necessarily immediate) consthuents. Now the immediate dominance schemata in ill/ IIPSG loll us how 1(5 eonstHlct phrases from words or other phrases. Thus the main operation for building a phrase is to create a new object being an instance of an ID schema (note thilt it) schemata are feature slrtlctures and therefore concepts) and I(5 fill in the required daughters by us; W the objects available as building mate,'ial.
