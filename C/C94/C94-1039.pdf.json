Note that this is in line with earlier analyses of adjuncts in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987) which where abandoned as it was unclear how the semantic contribution of adjuncts could be defined.","IIere we propose a solution in which adjuncts are members of the subcat list, just like ordinary arguments. The difference between arguments and adjuncts is that adjuncts are 'added' to a subcat list by a lexical rule that operates recursively. 1 Such a lexical rule might for example be stated as in figure 3.","Note that in this rule the construction of the semantics of a modified verb-phrase is still taken care of by a rood feature on the adjunct, containing a val and arg attribute.
