LTAG is a lexicalized mildly-context sensitive tree rewriting system [Joshi et al., 1975; Schabes, 1990] that is closely related to Dependency Grammars and Categorial Grammars. Elementary trees in 13~AG provicle a larger domain of locality over which syntactic and semantic (predicate-argument) constraints are specified. XTAG also serves as an LTAG grammar development system consisting of a predictive left-to-right parser, an X-window interface, a roof phological analyzer, and a part-of-speech tagger (also referred to as simply 'tagger')."]},{"title":"2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows the overall llow of the system when parsing a sentence.

It consists of approximately 317,000 inltected items, along with their root forms and intlectional intbrmalion (such as case, num-922 bet, tense). Thirteen parts of speech are diflerentiated: Noun, Proper Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Verb Particle, Adverb, Adjective, Preposition, Complementizer, Determiner, Conjunction, lntmjection, and Noun/Verb Contraction. Notms and Verhs are the largest categories, with approximately 213,000 and 46,500 inflected forms, respectively. '['he access time for a given inflected entry is 0.6 msec. 2.2 Part-of-Speech Tagger A trigram part-of-speech tagger [Church, 19881, trained on the Wall Street Jotlrilal Corpus, is incorporated in XTAG. The trigraln tagger has been extended to output the N-best parts-of-speech sequences [Soong and Huang, 1990]. XTAG uses this infer mat|on Io reduce the number of specious parses by filtering the possible parts-of-speech provided by the morphological analyzer for each word. The tagger decreases tile time to parse a sentence by an average of 93%. 2.3 Parser Tim system uses an Ea,'ley-style parser which has been extended to handle feature structures associated with trees [Schabes, 19901. The parser uses a general two-pass parsing s|rategy for 'lexicalized' gramlnars ISchabes, 19881. In the tree-selection pass, the parser uses tile syntactic database entry [or each lexical item in the sentence to select a set of elementary structures from the tree database. The tree-grafting pass composes the selected trees using substitution and adjunct|on operations to obtain the parse of the sentence. The output of tile parser for tile sentence I had a map yesterday is illustrated in l;igure 2. The parse tree I represents the surface constituent structure, while the derivation tree represents the deriwttion history of tile parse. The nodes of the derivation tree are the tree names anchored by tile lexical items. The composi-tion operation is indicated by the nature of Ihe arcs; a dashed line is used for substitution and a bold line for adjunct|on. The number beside each tree name is the address of the node at which the operation took place. Tile deriwltion tree can also be interpreted as a dependency graph with unlabeled arcs hetween words of the sentence. lleuristics that take advantage of 12FAGs have been implemented to improve the performance of tile parser. For instance, the span of the tree and the position of the anchor in the tree are used to weed out unsuitable trees in the first pass of the parser. Statistical information about the usage frequency of the trees","I liach node of Ihe parse tree has a ligature sh'uchlre, not shown here, associaled with it.

These methods speed the runt|me by approxmmtely 87%.","J 2.3.1 lleuristics for Ranking the 1 arses The parser generates the parses in a rank order. This ranking is determined using a combination of heuristics, which are expressed as structural preferences for deriwttion, e..g. attachment sites of adjuncts, right- vs. left- branching structures, topicalized sentences, etc. Similar hem'istics have been used for other parsers. See recent work by IHobbs and Bear, 199411, [Mc-Cord, 19931,and [Nagao, 1994t.","A partial list el ~ the heuristics used in XTAG follows:","1. Prefer argument positions to adjunct positions (here, this amotmts Io preferring fewer adjunct|on operations).","2. For PPs other Ihan o/', attach to nearest site that is llOt a proper noun.","3. Prefer right-branching structtu'e for sequences of adiectives adverbs and PPs. 923 4. 5. Prefer left-branching structure for sequences of norms. Prefer high attachment (wide-scope) for a moditier and a sequence of modifees of the same type (i.e. a PP following or preceding a coordinate NP, an adjective or determiner preceding a coordinate NP or sequence of Ns, an N preceding coordinate Ns).","These rankings are used to control the number of sentences passed on to further levels of processing. In applications emphasizing speed, only the highest ranked parse will be considered, in applications emphasizing accuracy, the top N parses can be considered. 2.3.2 Syntactic Database The syntactic database associates lexical items with the appropriate trees and tree families based on selectional information. The syntactic database entries were originally extracted from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary for Contemporary Idiomatic English; and then modified and augmented by hand. There are more than 37,000 syntactic database entries. Selected entries from this database are shown in Table 1. Each syntactic entry consists of an INDEX feld, the uninflected form under which the entry is compiled in the database, an ENTRY field, which contains all of the lexical items that will anchor the associated tree(s), a pos field, which gives the part-of-speech for the lexical item(s) in the ENTRY feld, and then either (but not both) a TREES or FAM field. The TREES field indicates a list of individual trees to be associated with the entry, while the FAM field indicates a list of tree families. A tree family, which corresponds to a subcategorization frame (see section 2.3.3), may contain a number of trees. A syntactic entry may also contain a list of feature templates (Fs) which expand out to feature equations to be placed in the specified tree(s). Any number of EX felds may be provided for example sentences. Note that lexical items may have more than one entry and may select the same tree more than once, using different features to capture lexical idiosyncrasies (e.g."]},{"title":"have). 2.3.3 Tree Database","paragraphs":["Trees in the English [;FAG framework fall into two conceptual classes. The smaller class consists o1' individual trees such as trees (a), (d), and (e) in Figure 3. These trees are generally anchored by non-verbal lexical items.

Trees 3(b) and 3(c) are members of two distinct tree families. As illustrated by trees 3(d) and 3(e), each node of a tree is annotated with a set of features whose wtlues may be specified within the tree or may be derived from the syntactic database. There are 385 trees that compose 40 tree families, along with 62 individually selected trees in the tree database. 924 NP"]},{"title":"(a)","paragraphs":["N t • NP0$ VP VO NP /$"]},{"title":"(b)","paragraphs":["~r NI'(~I, VP V0 I'1.0 NPI$"]},{"title":"(c)","paragraphs":["NP [ras ........ /ace] line .*"]},{"title":"<3>]","paragraphs":["Igl' : <2>] DeII'.I.
