The interest has naturally focussed on top-down methods because they are at least to a certain degree goal-directed.","In this paper, we present a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction, which we find advantageous for the following reasons:","Inerementality: Portions of an input string can be analysed as soon as they are produced (or generated as soon as the what-to-say component has decided to verbalize them), even for grammars where one cannot assume that the left-corner has been predicted before it is scanned.","Data-Drlven Processing: Top-down algorithms are not well suited for processing grammatical theories like Categoriai Grammar or nesG that would only allow very general predictions because they make use of general schemata instead of constructionspecific rules.

The instantiation (prediction) rule of top-down Earley deduction is not needed in bottom-up Earley deduction, because there is no prediction.

The set of selected clauses is (;ailed the chart. 3 The selection of clauses is guided by a scanning step (section 2.1) an(l indexing of clauses (section 2.2). 2.1 Scanning The purpose of the scanning step, whic:h corresponds to lexical lookup in chart parsers, is to look up base cases of recursive definitions to serve as a starting point for bottom-up processing. The scanning step selects clauses that can appear as leaves in the proof tree lbr a given goal C.","Consider the following simple definition of an HPSG, with the recursive definition of the predicate sign/I. 4","2This rule is called combine by Earley, and is also referred to as the flmdamental rule in the literature on chart parsing.","aThc chart differs from the state of [10] in that clauses in the chart arc indexed (cf. section 2.2).","4 We use feature terms in dcfinitc clauses in addition to Prolog terms, f:X denotes a feature structure where X is the value of h:ature f, and X ~ Y denotes the conjunction sign(X) <- phrasal_sign(X). sign(X) <- lexical sign(X).","phrasal sign(X ~ dtrs:(head dtr:RD & comp_dtr:CD) sign(RD), sign(CD), principles(X,HD,CD). ) <-","principles(X,HD,CD) <- constituent_order_principle(X,HD,CD), head_featureprinciple(X,RD),","constituent order principle(phon:X_Ph,","phon:HD_Ph,","phon:CD_Ph) <-","sequence_union(CD_Ph,HD_Ph,X_Ph).","The predicate sign/1 is defined recursively, and the base case is the predicate lexical_sign/1. But, clearly it is not restrictive enough to find only the predicate name of the base case for a given goal. The base cases must also be instantiated in order to find those that are useful for proving a given goal. In the case of parsing, the lookup of base cases (lexical items) will depend on the words that are present in the input string. This is implied by the first goal of the predicate principles/3, the constituent order principle, which determines ihow the l'nON value of a constituent is construtted from the eflON values of its daughters. in general, we assume that the constituent order principle makes use of a linear and non-erasing oI)eratkm tor combining stringsJ If this is the case, then M1 the words contained in the PnON value of the goal can have their lexical items selected as unit clauses to start bottom-up processing.","l%r generation, an analogous condition on logical forms has been proposed by Shieber [13] as the \"semantic monotonicity condition,\" which requires that the :logical form of every base case must subsume some portion of the goal's logical form.","Base case lookup must be defined specifically tbr different grammatical theories and directions of processing by the predicate lookup/2, whose first argument is the goal and whose second argument is the selected base case.

This avoids combination of items that are not adjacent in the input string.","lookup (phon : PhonLis t, lexical_sign(phon: [Word[ Suf] -Suf","synsem : Synsem) ) <- append(_, [Word I Suf] , PhonList), lexicon (Word, Synsem).","In bottom-up Earley deduction, the first step towards proving a goal is perform lookup for the goal, and to add all the resulting (unit) clauses to the chart. Also, all non-unit clauses of the program, which can appear as internal nodes in the proof tree of the goal, are added to the chart.","The scanning step achieves a certain degree of goal-directedness for bottom-up algorithms because only those clauses which can appear as leaves in the proof tree of the goal are added to the chart. 2.2 Indexing An item in normal context-free chart parsing can be regarded as a pair (R,S) consisting of a dotted rule R and the substring S that the item covers (a pair of starting and ending position). The fundamental rule of chart parsing makes use of these string positions to ensure that only adjacent substrings are combined and that the result is the concatenation of the substrings.","In grammar formalisms like DCG or IIPSG, the complex nonterminals have an argument or a feature (PtION) that represents the covered substring explicitly. The combination of the substrings is explicit in the rules of the grammar. As a consequence, Earley deduction does not need to make use of string positions for its clauses, as Pereira and Warren [10] point out.","Moreover, the use of string positions known from chart parsing is too inflexible because it el= lows only concatenation of adjacent contiguous substrings. In linguistic theory, the interest has shifted from phrase structure rules that combine adjacent and contiguous constituents to","• principle-based approaches to grammar that state general well-formedness conditions instead of describing particular constructions (e.g. IIPSG)","• operations on strings that go beyond concatenation (head wrapping [11], tree adjoining"]},{"title":"[15], sequence uuion [12]).","paragraphs":["The string positions known from chart parsing are also inadequate for generation, as pointed out by Shieber [13] in whose generator all items go from position 0 to 0 so that any item can be combined with any item.","Itowever, the string positions are useful as an indexing of the items so that it can be easily detected whether their combination can contribute to a proof of the goal. This is especially important for a bottom-up algorithm which is not goal-directed like top-down processing. Without indexing, there are too many combinations of items which are useless for a proof of the goal, in fact there may be infinitely many items so that termination problems can arise.","For example, in an order-monotonic grammar formalism that uses sequence union as the operation for combining strings, a combination of items would be useless which results in a sign in which the words are not in the same order as in the input string [14].","We generalize the indexing scheme from chart parsing in order to allow different operations for the combination of strings.

The Head Feature Principle just unifies two variables, so that it can be executed at compile time and need not be called as a goal at runtime. The Subcategorization Principle involves an operation on lists (appond/3 or dolot+/3 in different formalizations) that does not need bottom-up processing, but can better be evaluated by top-down resolution if its arguments are sulficiently instantiated. Creating and managing items for these proofs is too much of a computational overhead, arid, moreover, a proof may not terminate in the bottom-up case because infinitely many consequences may be derived fi'om the base case of a recursively defined relation.","In order to (teal with such goals, we associate the goals in the body of a clause with goal types.

The other goal types are also proved by resolution.","There are two potential sources of incompleteness in the algorithm. One is that the scanning step may not add all the program clauses to tim chart that are needed for proving a goal, and the other is that the indexing may prevent the deriva-tion of a clause that is needed to prove the goal.","In order to avoid incompleteness, the scanning step must add all program clauses that are needed for a proof of the goal to the chart, and the combination of indices may only fail for inference steps which are useless for a proof of the goal.

The addition of non-unit clauses should be made dependent on the goal and the base cases in order to go from a purely bottora-up algorithm to a directed algorithm that combines the advantages of top-down and bottom-up processing. It has been repeatedly noted [8, 17, 1] that directed methods are more efficient than pure top-down or bottom-up methods. However, it is not clear how well the directed methods are applicable to grammars which do not depend on concatenation and have no unique 'left cornet\" which should be connected to the start symbol.","It remains to I)e seeit how bottom-up Barley deduction compares with (and can be combined with) the improved top-down Barley deduction of l)hrre [3], Johnson [7] mud Neumann [91, and to head-driven methods with well-formed substring tables [1], and which methods are best suited for which kinds of problems (e.g. parsing, generation, noisy input, incremental processing etc.). 807"]},{"title":"References [1]","paragraphs":["Gosse Bouma and Gertjan van Noord.
