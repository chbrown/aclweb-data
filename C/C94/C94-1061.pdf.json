A grammar ,nodel for concurrent, object-oriented natural language l)arsing is introduced. Complete lexical distribution of grmnmatical knowledge is achieved huilding upon the head-oriented notions of valency and dependency, while inheritance mechanisms tire uscd to capture lexic;tl generalizations. The underlying concurrent computation m(xlel relies upon the actor l)aradigm. We consider message passing protocols for establishing de-l)cndency relations and amhiguity handling. 1 INTRODUCTION In this pal)er, we propose a grammar model that combines lexical organization of grammatical knowledge with lexicalized conlrol of the corresponding parser in an object-oriented specification framework. Recent developments in the lield of linguistic grammar theory have already yielded a rigid lexical modularization. This fine-grained decomlx)- sit|on of linguistic knowledge can he taken as a starting Ix)int for lexic,'tlized control. Current lexicalized grammars (for instance, IlPSG: Pollard & Sag, 1987; CG: t lcpple, 1992; Lexicalized TAG: Sehabes, Abe|lie & Josh|, 1988), however, still consider lexical items as passive data containcrs whosc content is uniformly inteq)reled by global control mechanisms (e.g., unification, functional composi-tion, tree adjunction). Divmging front these l)remises, we assign full procedural autonomy to lexical units and treat then~ as active lexical processes communicating with each other by message passing. Thus, they dynamically estal)- lish heterogcncous communication lines in order to determine each lexical item's funclional role. While the issue of lcxicalized control has early I)ecn investigated in the pauadiem of conceptual parsing (Ricsbeck & Schank, 1978), and word expert parsing in particular (Sinall & Ricger, 1982), these prol)osals am limited in several ways. First, they do not provide any general mechanism f()r the systematic incorporation of grammatical knowledge. Second, they do not supply any organizing facility to R)rmuh|te generalizations over sets of lexical items. Third, lexical communication is based on an entirely inform:l[ l)rotocol that lacks any grounding in principles of distributed computing.","We intend to remedy these metho(Iological shortconlings by designing a radically texicalized grammar on lhe basis of valency and dependency (these head-oriented notions aheady tigure in different shal)eS in many modem linguistic theories, e.g., kS suhc.'ltegorizations, case frames, thela roles), by introducing inheritance kS a major organizational mechanism (for a survey of at)plying inheritance","('LI'J-- Comtmtational Linguistics Research Group","Vreiburg University D-79085 Frciburg, Germany email: {nobi, hahn, sue}@coling.uni-frciburg.dc in in(xtem grammar theory, of.

As this protocol allows for asynchronous message passing, concurrency enters as a theoretical notion :it the level of grammar specification, not only as an implementatiolml feature. The ParseThlk m(×lel outlined in this paper can tllerefore be considered as an attempt to replace the static, global-control paradigm of natural language processing hy a dynamic, local-control mc×lel.","The design of such a grammar and its associated parser responds to the demands of complex language performance problems. By this, we mean tmderstanding tasks, such as large-scale text o, speech understanding, which not only require considerable portions of grammatical knowledge but also a vast amount of so-called non-line guistic, e.g., domain and discourse knowledge. A major problem then relates to the interaction of the different knowledge sources involved, an issue that is not so presstug when monolithic grammar knowledge essentially boils down to syntactic regularities. Instead of subscribing to any serial model of control, we Imild Ul)On evidences flom COml)utational text understanding studies (Granger, Eiselt & llolbrook, 1986; Yu & Simmons, 1990) as well as psycholinguistic experiments, in particular those worked out for the class of inter:lctive language processing m(xlels (Marslen-Wilson & Tyler, 1980; Thibadeau, Just &.

Grammatical specifications are given in the format of valency constraints attached to each lexical trait, on which the computation of concrete dependency relations is based. By way of inheritance the entire collection of lexical items is organized in lexieat hierarchies (these constitute the lexical grammar), the lexical items forming their leaves anti lhe intermediary nodes representing grammatical generalizations in terms of word classes. This speciIication is similar to various proposals currently investigated within the unification grammar community (Evans & Gazdar, 1990). The concurrent computation m(×lel builds upon and extends the formal foundations of the actor model, a theory of object-oriented computation Ihat is based on asynchronous message passing. 2.1 The Grammar M~xlel The grammar model underlying the ParseTalk approach considers dependency relations between words as the ftmdamental notion of linguistic analysis. A modifier is said lo depend on its head if the modifier's occurrence is permitted by the head but not vice versa 2. Dependencies are thus asymmetric binary relations that can be established by local computations involving only two lexical items; they are tagged by delxzndency relation names from the set © =","3 {spee, subj, ppatt .... } .

The SNI'ISFII,:S predicale Note that unlike most l)revious dependency grammar formalisms (Starosla & Nomu,a, 1986; Ilellwig, 1988; Jiippinch, Lassila & Lehtola, 1988; Fraser & l ludson, 1992) this criterion assigns equal opportunities to synlactic as well as conceptual conditions for computing valid del)eU-dency relations, lnfommtion on word classes, morphosynlactic features, and order constraints is tmrely syntactic, while conceptual compatibility introduces an additional description layer to I)e satisfied before a grammatical relation may be established (of. Muraki, lehiyama & lVukumo - chi, 1985; Lesmo & Lombardo, 1992). Note that we restrict the scope of tile unilicatiou module in our framework, as only morphosyntactic features are described using this sul)formalism. This contrasts sharply with standard unification grammars (and with designs [or dependency parsing as advocated by llellwig (1988) and Lombardo (1992)), where virtually all information is encoded in tenns of the unification formalism 4. 2.1.1 A Look at (;rammalic.'ll llierarchies The grammatical styecifieation of a loxical entry consists of structural criteria (valencies) ~ behavioral descriptions (protocols).

On the other hand, the concept hierarchy is based on the subsumption relation holding between concepts, which is computed by a terminological classifier. Most lexicon entries refer to a corresponding domain concept and thus allow concepttml restrictions to be checked. 2.2 The Actor Computation Model The actor model of computation combines object-oriented features with concurrency and distribution in a method-ologically clean way. It assmnes a collection of independent objccLs, the actors, communicating via asynchronous message passing. An actor can send messages only to other actors it knows about, its acquaintances. The arrival of a message at an actor is called an event; it triggers the execution of a method that is composed of atomic actions, viz. creation of new actors c~ aetorTypo (acquaintances)), sending of messages to acquainted or a newly created actors (send actor message), or specification of new acquaintances (become (acquaintances)). An actor system is dynamic, since new actors can be created and the communication topology is reconligurable. We assume actors that process a single message at a time, step by step (l[ewitt & Atkinson, 1979). For convenience, we establish a synchronous request-reply protocol (Licberman, 1987) to compute functions such as uniIication of feature structures and queries to a (conceptual) knowledge hase. In contrast to simple messages which unconditionally trigger the execution of a method at the receiving actor, we {loll ne complex word actor messages as fntl-lledged actors with independent computatiomd abilities. Departure and :nrival of complex messages are actions which arc perfornted by the message itself, taking the sender and the target actors as parameters. Upon arrival, a complex message determines whether a copy is forwarded to selected acquaintances of its receiver and whether the receiver may process the message on its own (of. Schacht, [Iahn & Br~3ker (1994) for a treatment of the parser's behavioral aspects).","The following syntax elements will he used subsequently: a program contains actor definitions (declaring the acquaintances and defining the methods of actors instantiated from this definition) and actor message dc~nitions (stating distribution and computation conditions). Method definitions contain the message key, the fonnal parameters and a composite action: actorDef ::= defActor actorType (acquaintance)","method Def* methodDef ::=.m~ messageKey (param) (action) messDet ::= defMsg message-type (acquaintance)","(((if condition distributeTo tag))*","if condition com_~","((if condition distribuleTo tag))*) action ::= action; action","I if condition (action) [ else (action) ]","I send actor messageKey (param*)","I become (acquaintance*)","I create actorType ' * (acquaintance)","I for var in set : (action) condition is a locally computable l)rcdicate, written as PREDICATE (actor'); actor stands for acquaintances, parameters, newly created actors, the performing actor itself (se_~ or the mldelined value (nil); actor.acquaintance yields the correstx)nding acquaintance of actor; fo__zr var in_. set: (action) evaluates action for each element of set.","3 A SIMPLIFIED PROTOCOL FOR ESTAB-LISIIING DEPENDENCY RELATIONS The protocol described below allows to establish dependency relations. It integrates structural restrictions on dependency trees lind provides for domesticated concurrency 3.1 Synchronizing Actor Activities: Reception Protocol A reception protocol allows tin actor to determine when all events (transitively) caused by a message have terminated. This is done by sending replies hack to the initialor of the message. Since complex messages can be quasi-recursively forwarded, the tmmber of replies cannot be determined in advance. In addition, each actor receiving such a message may need an arhitrary amount of processing time to terminate the actions caused by the message (e.g., the establishment of a dependency relation requires communication via messages that takes indeterminate time). There- ['()re, each actor receiving the message must reply to the initiator once it has terminated processing, informing the initiator to which actors the message has been forwarded.","A message is a reception message if(I) the receiver is required to (asynchronously) reply to the initiator with a receipt message, and (2) the initiator queues a reception task. An (explicit) receipt message is a direct message containing a set of actor identities as a parameter. This set indicates to which actors the receptior! message has been forwarded or delcg,'tled. The enclosed set enahles the receiver (which is the initiator of the reception message) to wait until all receipt messages have arrived 5. In addition to explicit receipts, which are messages solely used for termination detection, there are regular messages that serve a similar purpose besides their primary ftmction within the parsing process. They are called implicit receipt messages (one example is the"]},{"title":"headAccopted","paragraphs":["message described in Section 3.3). A reception task consists of a set of partial descriptions of the messages that must be received (implicit as well as explicit), and an action to be executed after all receipts have arrived (usually, sending a message). 5 This, of course, only happens if the distribmion is limited: The searchHead message discussed Ix:low is only distributed to the head of each receiver, which lllllSl (~etlr ill Ihe gallic st~rltellCe.

This is feasible when syntactic analysis is the only determining factor for the distribution of partial structures. But if conceptual knowledge is taken into account, the distribution of a phrase is not fully determined by its syntactic structure. Possible conceptual relations equally influence the distribution of the phrase. Additionally, the inclusion of an ambiguous phrase in a larger syntactic context requires the modification of the conceptual counterparts. In a packed representation, there would have to be several conceptual counterparts, i.e., only the syntactic representation can be packed (and it might even be necessary to unpack it on-the-fly). Consequently, whenever conceptual analysis is integrated into the parsing process (as opposed to its interpretation in a later stage, thereby producing numerous ambiguities in the syntactic analysis), structure sharing is impossible, since different syntactic attachments result in different conceptual analyses, and no common structure is accessible that can be shared (cf. Akasaka (1991) for a similar argument). We expect that the over-head of duplication is compensated for by the ambiguityreducing effects of integrating several knowledge sources. 4.2 Relation to Psycholinguistic Perfnrnmnce Models It has been claimed that human language understanding proceeds in a more sequential mode, choosing one alternative and backtracking if that path fails (e.g., Ilemforth, Konieczny & Strube, 1993). This model requires the rank-ing of all alternatives according to criteria referring to syntactic or conceptual knowledge. The protocol outlined so far could easily be accommodated to this processing strategy: All headFound messages must be collected, and the corresponding attachments ranked. The best attachment is selected, aml only one headAccepled message sent. In case the analysis fails, the next-best attachment would be tried, until an analysis is found or no alternatives are left. Additionally, the dependencies established during a failetl path would have to be released. 7 5 COMPARISON TO RELNI'EI) WORK The issue of object-oriented parsing and concurrency (for a survey, cf.
