China Abstract","This paper introduces a semantic theory I)I,PW, l)ynamic l,ogic with Possible World, which extends Groenendijk's I)PI, and Cresswell's Indices Semantics. The semantics can interpret the temporal and modal sense and anaphora. Key words: Semantic Model, Dynamic l,ogic, Possible Worlds. § 1 Introduction","At present there are three main aspects in semantical field: 1. Transformation of' sentences or discourses into formulas in high order logic. 2. Semantic interpretation of the logical formulas. 3. Semantic ambiguity.","This paper presents the semantics, dynamic logic with possible world, which combines DPIJ 3~ with Indices semantics r'~ and extends the theories, the theory can be used to interpret the temporal and modal sense and anaphoric connection. For the limitation of space we only give the definitions and examples concerned rather than present a formalization which should include the axioms and rules concerned like u I)pL TM","Following Montague semantics, the discussion on meaning of a sentence started with predicate formula, high order logical formual with lambda terms, which is translated from a sentence S by means of a set of rules and reduced to a frst order predicate formula A finally.","Problem= given an expression A, meaningEA~=? Assume that a model M is an ordered pair (D, F) where D is a domain, a non-empty set and F an interpretation function assigning a semantic value to each non-logical constant of the language. A value assignment g is a function assigning a member of D to each variable of the language. W is a possible world. The intension of the expression A is Int['A~----- IIAII M*.
