Rather than using length-based or translation-based criterion, a part-of-speech-based criterion is proposed. We postulate that source texts and target texts should share the same concepts, ideas, entities, and events. Simulated annealing approach is used to implement this aligmnent algorithm. The preliminary experiments show good performance. Most importantly, the experimental objects are Chinese-English texts, which are selected from different language families. 1. Introduction Real texts provide the alive phenomena, usages, and tendency of langnage in a parlictflar space and time. This recommends us to do the researches on the corpora. Recently, many rese~{rchers timber claim that \"two languages art more informative than one\" (Dagan, 1991). They show that two languages coukl disambigna.te each other (Gale e¢ al., 1992); bilingual corpus could form a bilingual dictionary (Brown et al., 1988) and terminology correspondence bank (Eijk, 1993); a refined bilingual corpus could be formed the examples for machine translation systems (Sumita et al., 1990). To do such kinds of researches, the most impmlant task is to align the bilingual texts.","Many length-based alignment algorithms have been proposed (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991a). The correct rates are good. However, the languages they processed belong to occidental family. When these algorithms are applied to other rtmning texts from different families, will the performance keep on tile same level? Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex.","In tiffs paper, we will introduce a part-of-speech (POS)-based alignment algorithm. Section 2 will touch on the level of alignment and define the sentence terminators. In Section 3, we will propose tile criterion of critical POSes and investigate the distribution of these POSes in the Chinese-English texts. Section ,l will describe a fifir and rigorous method for evaluating performance. Then, we apply simulated annealing technique to conducting experiments and show tile experimental results in Section 5. Section 6 will give a brief conclusion. 2. Alignment Problem Alignment has three levels: 1) paragrapll; 2) sentence; and 3) word. Paragraph level is sometimes called discourse level. Many efforts are involved in senlence level and fewer researchers louch on the word level (Gale and Clmrch, 1991b). To do sentence alignment, we should first define what a sentence is. ILl English, tile sentence terminators are fifll stop, question mark, and exclamation mark. [[owever, tim usage of punctuation marks is unrestricted in Chinese and the types of punctuation marks are numerous (Yang, 1981). Nevertheless, in order to parallel the languages, we define that tile sentence markers are fldl slop, question mark, and exclamation mark over all languages. Therelbre, an alignment of two texts is to find a best sequence of sentcnce groups, which arc ended with one of tile sentence ternlillalors.","Following Brown el al. (1991), we use tile term bead. A bead contains some sentences of source and largct texls. Thus, alignment can be defined as (1).","(I) An alignment is to find a bead sequence under some crileria. If Ihe applied criteria are significant, the performance will be good. Finding significant criteria is tile core of this research. 3. Criteria of Alignment ALLy aligmnenl algorilhm has its own criteria. For example, many alignment algorithms are based on sentence lengfl~ and word correspondence. Here, wc propose a POSes-based crilerion.","(2) Alignment Crilerion: \"File numbers of critical part of speeches (POSes) of a langt,age pair in an aligned bcad are close. 166 Now, the problem ix what forms the critical POSes. Following many gr~,mmar formalisms (Sells, 1985), the content words will be the good indicalors. Therefore, we think nouns, verbs, and adjectives as the critical POSes. In addition, we inch,de mm~bers and quotation marks in the critical POSts due to intuition. The English tagging system used in this work follows that of the LOB Corpus (Johansson, 1986). The Chinese tagging system follows that of the BDC Corpus (BDC, 1992) but with some modilications. The BI)C COrlms docs not assign tags to Imnctualion marks. We adopl Ihe same philosophy of I,OB Corpus to assign the tags of the punctuation marks as themselves. These critical POSes in English and in Chinese arc listed in Table 1.

That is to say, the error will be limitcd in a range. Our criterion for evaluating performance takes care of the two factors.","For a given text, we could manually find the real alignment.

If we allow various types of beads and adopt the optimal search, tile processing cost is too high to stand. A good algorithm should satisfy tile following two conditions: It is a general local search algorithm. It allows the unlinfited bead types in the aligning process. Under this consideration, simulated annealing approach (Aarts and Korst, 1989) is used to align texts. The idea of annealing comes from condensed matte,\" physics. It involves two steps: 1) increasing temperature of matter; 2) decreasing temperature gradually until the matter in the ground configuration. Simulated annealing is to sinudate the almealing process. Therefore, a simnlated annealing mechanistn is composed of four parts: configuration, (ransition fimction, energy fimction, and annealing schedule. If we take an alignment as a configuration, the possible alignmenls constitute tile configuration space. In addition, every configuration is associated with an energy. The optimal configuration is tile one which has tile lowest energy. Simulated annealing is to find tile optimal configuratio,i from an initial configuration by generating a sequence of configurations under a control parameter.","For our application, we introduce another component, Transition Vector. The five components are defined as follows.","(5) Configuration (C): An alignment is a configuration naturally. For example, a possible bead sequence, {(1,21, (I,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,1)}, is a configuration.","(6) 7)'ansition l,'unction (T): Given a configuration, this fimction is responsible for generating its next configuration.

If N equals to 1, a new bead is generated. IV represents which language ill tile selected bcad should be moved ont. If W equals to 0, one of the marginal sentences of tile first language should bc moved out. Otherwise, one of tile marginal sentences of the second language should be moved out. I) represents the moving direction. 0 denotes the left marginal sentence of the selected bead is moved left, and 1 denotes the right marginal sentcnce of the selected bead is moved right.

However, the simulated annealing approach could reduce the risk, and the performance will keep over 78% in our experiment. 6. Conclusion A new criterion to aligning texts is proposed in this paper. The criterion is based on an observation that the source texts and thc target texts should share the same concepts, entities, ideas, and events. Sentence length (no matter word-based or character-based) (Brown, el al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991a), is not so critical on languages across different language families. Translation-based crilcrion (Kay, 1991; ChErt, 1993) is very. uscfifl, but il is also very complex. Surely, to decide word correspondences is difficull. Our criterion provides a tradcoff between the length-based criterion and the translation-based criterion. The elucs of critical POSes are parlially syntactic and partially statislic~d.","ThE performance of simulated annealing approach to alignment is 94% in our Experiment, if we use the paragraph markers. Without paragraph marker, the value drops lo 78%. GEnerally speaking, it works well for languages across different language families.","The main conlribntion of lhis work is to provide an alignment algorithm for aligning oriental langvages with occidental languages. The fitture work should focus on the large experiment, normalizing the weight of critical POSes and other search techniques. 170 Acknowledgements Research on this paper was partially supported by National Science Council grant NSCg,l-(}40g-l~002-005.","References","Aarts, E. and J.
