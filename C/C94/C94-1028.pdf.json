Its operation is, however, completely independent of the other components of the Jatl2kP system, so that RUMORS could be used in any other AT system irrespective of its source l~nguage. Basically, RUMORS constitutes a system in its own right, which can also be used for purposes other th~n tra~nsl~tion, e.g., as ~ computerized reference book of Russian morphology and the simplest phenomena of syntactic government a~td agreement (for students and teachers of Russian), ~ part of spell-checking system, etc.","The RUMORS synthesizer has two m~jor modes of oper~tlon: the QUERY mode ttnd the TASK mode.","In the QUERY mode of operr~tion, ItUMOItS accepts, as its input, a separate syntactico-morphological query (entered from the keybo~Lrd) which represents the lexeme to be processed ~nd the synttmtlcal.~.nd morphological ch araeteristics specifylag the word-form to be obtained by the processing. The output is, primarily, the desired word-form of the input lexeme or, if necessary, ~ periphrastic ~u6stitute for this word-form.","After obtaining this output, the user c~t switch at will to the FULL PARADIGM submode of the QUERY mode. In this submode, RUMORS gener- ~rte8 all synthetic word-forms of the input lexeme (or of the l~t lexeme processed while obtaining a pcriphra~tic word-combina.tion). It n],o offers s. set of menus alIowing the user to modify his initial qlmry by choosing additions] morphologicM categorh~s from ~;lLese It] (2~rtll S.","In the TASK mode~ the input d~t~ is i~ sequence. of queries fed from the special TASK file. Apart from lexical, morphological, and syntacticM inform~ tlon contained in eaclt query, the TASK mode of opertLtion m~kes considerable use of word order (l~t~ which is essential, axnong other things, for processing prepositional, adjectival and noun phrases. The output is the sequence of word-forms manifesting the phrases or sentences specified by the input sequence of queries.","Both in the QUERY ttnd bt th.e TASK modes, the output is displayed on the screen and written slmultaneously in the speci~ SOLVE file. If required by the user, it may Mso include the alterations rome in the queries processed and the d~tubase informa~tion used in their processing. Inasmuch as the simulatio~t by RUMORS of ttte linguistic processes involved in tl.ussla~t synthesis is faithful enough, this ~uxillary d~ttL could be valuable by itself (e.g., for learning or teaching Russian), ~ide from its significance for debugging and controlling purposes."]},{"title":"2 Synthesis functions envisaged by RUMORS","paragraphs":["2.1 Morphoh)gical functions The morphologic~ functlolts of RUMORS cover HI aspects of Russia.n in~le:don, as well as some semr~nticMly bafic lcxico-morphologlcaJ relationships.","'['he inlh:xiona] funetions tLre initiated after the input query ha~ ~dreaxty been subjected to syntactical and lexieo-morphologlcal operations, which retry lltrve modified its htitial form. At this stage, ii: contMas nothing but the lexeme and the infiexiontd categories specifying its desired word-form. If some categories needed for complete specifictrtion of this word-form are not explicltly stated in the query, they are settled by default. E.g., a query containing nothing but the lexeme of a verb is taken to describe the finite 177 form, indicutlve mood, present tense, active voice, 3d person singular of this verb, so that the query, s~y, 6pam~ produces the form 6epem.","The inilexional model of Russian implemented by RUMORS is the one proposed and detailed by prof. A.A.Zaliznyak (1977). Its important virtue is tttat the generation procedures it envls~ges represent those to be expected of human speakers of Russian more faithfully than any other known model, wtfile the requisite database information is very compact.","Our verslo~t of ZaliznyaMs inflexionai model differs from its description in (Zaliznyabq1977) in two respects. On the one haztd~ we have reduced the scope of the original Zalizny~k's model, implementing it only in so fax as written Russltrn is concerned. As tr result, quite a number of the p~rticulars of Russian accentuation registered in (Zallznyak,1977), nt~mely, all those that axe relev~t for oral speech only, have been ignored.","On the other hand, we h~ve extended the model to cover analytical word-forms. Moreover, we have in-troduced a new type of morphological functions, the periphrastic functions allowing RUMORS to produce output that makes sense even if the required worfl-form is non-existent (e.g., due to the lexeme h~ving a defective paradigm or to the combination of cs.tegorlea in the query being beyond the scope of Russlan infiexlonal morphology). E.g., the future tense ist person singular of the verb","noge~um~ 'win' (which does not h~ve thls form) is p~r~phrased","e.uo~y noge~urn~ '< I > ~hall be able to win'.","The lexlco-morphological functions of RUMORS axe limited so fax to conversion between lexemes having essentially similak semantics, but differins in their part-of-speech or (for verbs only) aspectuai characteristics. 'l'hus~ the aspectuM or part-of-speech markers in the following three queries","paaocrn.~arn~:coo,","Snarn~:lI c~use the lexeme~ in these queries to be replaced, resp., by the required perfective verb, noun, a:nd adjective:","paeemu.aarat,","~l, ne~lue t","u$o ecmubtl~I. The implementation of aspectual lexico-morphological relations is based, principally, o~t their description in (Zalizny~k,1977). For p~rt-of-speech relations, we have adopted, though in a very limited sense, the concept of lexical substitutions (Zholkovsldj,Mel'chuk, 1970).","If the d~tabase contains no information necessary for switcldng to a lexeme of the desired a~pect or paxt of speech, RUMORS resorts to its periphrastic functions or else m~kes modifications i~t the query. E.g., the query","'~U~OS~Ug : 1' aimed at forming the verb corresponding to the noun uunoouur 'bureaucrat', will be processed to produce the phrase:","Deaaern ms, umo xapa~mepno DAx uu~oo~uEa","'< He > is doing what is typical of a bureaucrat'. 2.2 Syntactical functions RUMORS has two m~jor types of syntactical funetlons: relational ttnd word-string sues. There is alas a third group of prepositional]unctions.","Relational functions may be called both in the QUERY and in the TASK mode of operation to modify the input query with regard to the relational re}. erenees it may include. There may be references to dependency relations, where the node specified by the query acts either as dependent (D-references) or as governor (G-references}, and to ~napttoric relations (F-references). I)- and G-references may contain embedded rehLtional references, so that in the genera] case each reference present in the input query corresponds to tL more or leas corrtplex fragment of the dependency and anaphoric structure this query is p~rrt of.","The job of the rel~tlonal functions is to ensure fulfilment of the requirements for syntectical government and ~greement which may be imposed on the word-form specified by the query by the dependency and anaphorlc relations this query has refereuces to. Tkls involves extr0cting such requirements from the references in the query, reconciling them with enc.h other (if there axe two or more references dictating conflicting requlrements)~ a.nd then rnodifylng the inltim query to fit them: choosirtg the correct prepoultion or conjunction (tire empty one, if needs be) to accompany the goal word-form, ~Itd ulteringj a~ required, the inflexional and paxt-obspeech categories within the query. E.g., the query","pemenue R D~(aat~ucem~) describing the noun petueuue 'decision~an the synt~tctical object of the verb oasueem~ 'depend' will produce the prepo~itlonai combination:","om pemenu~r '< depend > on < the > decision'.","Word-strlng fimctlons axe specific to the TASK mode of operation only. Their peculiarity is that they include some t~nalysis-llke operations maldng it possible to locate s.nd process simple prepositional, adjectival and noun phrazes, even if the input sequence of queries h~ no syntactical marking.","To be more partlcul~r, word-strlng processing consists in ext~mining the queries of the input sequence one by one until the query under examlutLtlon is found to answer our definition of the end of a word-string. During this ex~min~tlon, e~ch query is checked for information relevant to agreement tLnd prel)ozitionaJ gow~rnmenl;, ~J,nd tile inflexion~l ;J,ad 178 paxt-of-speech c~tegorles pertaining to such inform,> tion axe integrated into a special word-strir~g query (w-query). After the end of the word-string bus been located and exarnhted, the w-query obta.hted is, i~t staatdaxd ca~es~ rome common to all of the individual queries within this word-string. 'rhus~ the sequence of morphologically empty querle, for lexemes","o, oec b ~atu, aa.~a~amura 'in, all, our, galaxy' will be processed to pro&me the prepodtionM phrase:","so 8ee~ uataeCl eaaa~mu~e","'in the whole of our #alaxy'. Some types of word-strlngs, e.g. tho~e containing ct~rdinM numerals, have to be subjected to more elaborate operations.","If • query with la a word-string contains rela.tlonal references, the requirements imposed by these are given priority over the requirements extr~ted by word-string functions~ so that the l~tter provide a sort of default.","Prepositional functions s.re employed in both modes of operation, if the word-form or word-string being processed is to be preceded by a preposition. Tltus~ if ttte preposition i~t question denote~ location, direction or source, the noun it i~ meant to accompanty is checked for having lexical preferences in thi~ respect. This helps to account, e,g., for such idiomrttiCfl a.fl","aa yam~e 'in the ~treet'","VS.","n nepeyaue 'in the aide-,~treet'. Other prepositional fa~tctio,ts serve to ~dd the prothetie u to personal pronouns ~.fter prepositions imposhtg this requirement, to choose the eoutextual form of the prepositlon if it ha~ more tht~n one of theft h etc.","The data.base ha~ thus been reduced to leas than one fifth of (ZMiznya.k,1977), still Mt'ordiIIg correct morphologica.l proees,~ing of M1 of the 100 000 lexemes listed in (7,ali'anyak,1977).","Moreover, so far ~m lexeme8 with st~n(hLrd morpho- ]ogle'el ch~razterlstlcs go, they ctLn now be processed correctly, even if they axe newly-colned or occasional (and do not htwe therefore dictionaxy entries of their own).
