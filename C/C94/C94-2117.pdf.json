In the experiments, we basically examined the occurrence of zero anaphors in a real text and the ones generated by the algorithms employing the rules, assuming the same semantic and discourse structures as the text. The factors of locality, syntactic constraints, discourse structure and salience of objects were considered in the rules. The results of the experiment show that 93% of the zero anaphors in the text can be correctly generated by an algorithm using a rule involving all the above factors."]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["Introduction Anaphoric expressions in Chinese can be classified as zero, pronominal and nominal forms, as exemplified in (1) by ¢~, ta I (tie) and nage ren I (that person), respectively."]},{"title":"(1)a.

The initial result showed that zero anaphors were over-generated to a large extent in the text produced by employing Rule l. Consequently, we considered other well-known factors namely, syntactic constraints [Li and Thompson 81], discourse structure [Grosz and Sidner 86] and the salience ofobjecl, s in ut teranees [Sidner 83], to get better results. 2 Experiment A number of articles written by different authors were selected as the linguistic sources with which the text produced by employing the generat, ion algorithms can be compared. For the moment, the selected articles are restricted to the exposition type, namely, ones which explain an idea or discuss a problem. Two sets of data were selected; one consists of a nunlber of scientiff(: questions and answers for children and the ol~her is a brief introduction to modern Chinese grammar. Basically the experiment was executed in three steps. First, zero anaphors within the selected articles were identiffed. Second, h)r each paragraph in the selected 732 articles, we examined each utterance sequentially nnd recorded the occurrence of zero anaphors that wouhl be obtained by applying the algorithm using a rule, like Rule 1. Third, we noted down the dilfcrenees between the results of stel)s 1 nnd 2.","In step 3, we categorized the differences betweea the results ms: correct, fitlse and missiug types.

Therefore, we annotated the boundaries between discourse segments in the testing data and the hierarchical discourse structures according to the discourse segment intentions. We farther carried out a test by comparing our annotations with other native speakers of Chinese. In the test, four native speakers of Chinese were asked to do the same tasks we have done for five articles selected from the testing data. Comparing with the speakers' results, on average 76% of the speakers' annotations coincide with ours. According to the ahove comparison the annotations we made were reliable for the purpose of the experiment.","We then performed the experiment by employing the algorithm of Rule 2. As shown in Table 2, for the. Set 1 data, 49 and 12 zero anaphors were over- aIM under-generated by the algorithm, respectively. For the other set of testing data, Rule 2 achieves an even better result.

The basic idea here is to investigate the positions of antecedent and anaphor in their respective utterances. In the following, we divided the position of anapbors in their respective utterances into topic and non-topic. For each anaphor, its antecedent's position is one of the following categories: topic, direct object or the NP following a presentative verb and others. We thus classify the following types, A to F, of antecedent-anaphor pairs: the antecedents of Types A and C are ill topic position, of B and D are in direct object position or are the NP following a presentative verb, and of E and F are in other positions; the anaphors of Types A, B and E arc in topic position, and of C, D and F are in non-topic positions.","Since in the new rule conditions on topic and non-topic will only be considered after the conditions in Rnle 2, in investigating the antecedcnt-anaphor pairs, we have to exclude the ones with either their anaphors violating syntactic constraints on zero anaphor or at the beginning of discourse segments. In other words, the new condition will be attached under the Z-node in the decision tree of Fig. 2. In the Set 1 test, lag data, there are 239 such pairs, among which anaphors of 49 pairs are zeroed by the algorithm of Rule 2 but appear in non-zero forms in the text. In other words, the 49 anaphors were over-generated by onr algoritbm, which in our terms belong to the false type; the other 190 cases belong to the correct type. The number of each type of pairs for both correct and over-generated cases in the testing data are shown in Table 3.

Thus, if we let anaphors of Types A and B be zero and Types C and E non-zero, then there will be 29 (15+14) over-generated zero anaphors and 5 (l-t-4) under-generated ones for the Set 1 testing data. The numhers for Types D and F do not conclusively support eitber usir, g zero or non-zero in this case. In Chen's study [Chen 87], he fonnd a higher percentage of zero anaphors occurring in the topic position with their antecedent most frequently in the topic or object positions of the immediately previous utterance, which strongly supports the idea of letting anaphors of Types A arm B be zero and others non-zero.
