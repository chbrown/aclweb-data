This provides a powerflil augnlentation to the basic nctwork.","4,4 The Augmented Semantic Network Tile semantic network in this system is basically a hierarchy of Objects, States and Events. The addition of features to the semantic network in effect adds links to the network. Two kinds of link are proposed: permanent links and temporary links. Permanent' links are conditions that must be true for a certain action or state-of-affairs to bold. The other, temporary, links are used to create a default state for the objects mentioned in the text. As the text is processed, these links may change, so that the information awtilable to the system will differ from one sentence to the next. 4.4.1 The Links The division between Objects, States and Events is reflected in tlle type of feature given to semantic itclnS. For exainple, Events typically coilgain features about the sort of things that are affected by that event; States contain information the types of objects that may be in that state; Objects contain iilforlnaiiou about any subparts or if they themselves are typically part of another (larger) object and wliat type of Event they are typically involved in.","On this basis, the following types of link are proposed: . Condition (=c): (permanent) a condition that must |lold for a State or Event to come about. , Before Condition (BC::): (pernianeut) a condition that must be trlie before an Event or State conies about. * After Condition (AC::): (permanent) a co,ldition that becomes trtie after an Event or State comes about. * Has Subpart (l,as): (tenlporary) an Object lias re-- lated subparts or is a subpart of another Object. * Characteristic (has Semautic.Label): (I.emliorary) an Object has the characteristic of Senmntie_Lal)el (usually an Abstract_Relation: Size, Shape Colour etc.). This takes the form of: \"lteni has Senlautie_Label\", such as \"Pelerhas Existel,ee Lif~span\". Tiffs states that an item witll tile semantic item Peter has an existence of some kind and filrther locates tllat itenl on a path of the network to the abstract relation of lAfespan. Iu this way, nodes between these two points are all available for reference by the inference system. . Ability (able_to): (temporary) This is not fully defined in tim current systenl but represents characteristic features of items e.g. \"dooF' often appears in the tlleme position of tile Events Open aud ,O'hll[. These liuks are considered sutllcient for tile current capabilities of the system. I,inks may be deleted or others added as the range of the sytem widens, if this is tllought necessary or desirable. 4.4.2 Permanent .(k Tenlporary Links The dlfference between perrnallent and I;enll)orary links is iu the nature of the iuformation that they convey. Permauent links are those that are augmented to tile lletwork and COlllleCt uodes cue I,o tile other in accordance with the features found in those nodes. ~Bef(~re Condition and Aries\" Condition links are permanent, although the hiformation contaiued in the uodes that, t.hey connect to will only become awdl-able to the context nlonitor iu accordance with the tense al/d aspect of the verb (i.e.. all After Condilion is obviously only valid crier the completion of the (for exalnplc) action denoted by a verb has finished. Teniporary liuks are those that supply default illforfllation to the COlltext Il~Ollitor coucerning nodes that it is COliCerlied wii.h. 'Fhus, for exaluF, le > an entry for a bird iuight state that it is Able_To Fly. llowever, if the input text were to state that a particular bird is unable to fly, that A1Ao \"l'o link would be cancelled.

Thus the semantic item \"John\" is first linked with the semantic feature \"lluman\" and all the other featm'es inherited from that feature.

It depends entirely on the links between nodes of the network and there is an obvious limit as to how complicated those links may I)eeome before the processing required to search all t,he nodes linked to a particular item becomes prohibitiw~'. At, the current, stage of planning, a strnctnre (a semantic il.eni) may be linked to another via one node (constrained l o be an Abstract It.elation). There are no current plans I.o increase the number of such linking nodes.","The inference mechanism is also expected to per-form poorly where actions denoted by a wn'b are COlllplex. This is due to the very simple feature descriptions that we use in the systenl. It might therefore be desirable that, if the processing is not ccmlpleted within, for example, a constrained time, the process be terminated and the context moiiit,or left to rely on semantic feature matching alone.","Another major problem is writing the features for the links in the network. At the moment, all features are written by hand, })tit, it is hoped that sinlilar information might be extracted from semantic and case-fi'ame dictionaries. The context monitor is currently written in PII0-LOG 9. The program eui'rently consists of several hundred lines of PROLOG."]},{"title":"6 Final Remarks","paragraphs":["The idea of using contextual information in Machine Translation has been proposed before ([br exainple [Wada 90],[Elwrle 92],[llaendt 921), ho,vev,'r, there SeelfiS to be little researc]l carried ()lit ill the field.
