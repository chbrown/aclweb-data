INTRODUCTION","Transformational grammars have developed with recent research in linguistics. They appear to be a powerful and explicit device for characterizing the description of sentences; they also meet conditions of adequacy that can be applied to check that a sentence, or a set of rules, is well-formed.","A transformational grammar tester is part of a strategy for the selection of a well-formed grammar matching the data base. To put it more explicitly, a tester of this sort should provide the linguist a class of the possible grammars which concerns precisely the linguistic theory.

GENERAL CAPACITIES OF THE SYSTEM","The system OBLING is divided into four parts: a main program LING, the service subroutines, the phrase structure grammar tester and the transformational grammar testers. LING and the service subroutines are stored in the central memory while the two grammars testers operate on disks.","The main program invokes the various linguistic rules and controls the application of these rules to the data base structure(s) or the derived structure(s).

SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES OF THE PROGRAM LING","The program LING will first initialize the working areas. Then, it loads and operates the program V~rlCATEU~ which, after the reading and the verification of the input data, returns control to LINe. 124 SERGE BOISVERT- ANDI~ DUGAS- DENISE BELANGER","ZING will then load and execute, using an overlay technique, the small control programs cYcH Q1, CYCLI Q2 .... , cYcLI Qi. Each of these handles, in conjunction with HNG, the mapping on the input structure of a fixed number of transformation rules. In the current version of the program, cYctI Q1 deals with the linguistic transformational rules T1 to Ts included, cYcrI Q2 the rules To to T10 included, etc. The total number of these control programs cYcrI Q depends on the memory space allowed; processing is most efficient if the number of these control programs is as small as possible. 5. INFORMATION PATTERN BETWEEN LING AND VERIFICATEUR","When VERI~CATEUR (the phrase structure grammar tester) is in memory, the structure to be analysed is read from the standard input unit (punched cards) and is processed by the subroutine Cr~RB~ to LING","v V~ICATBD~ c'zcLi qO • T CKARBRE ARBRE verification printing of syntagmatic of the tree","rules Fig. 3.

This subroutine first checks if the phrase structure is consistent, then calls up eke which tests the names of the constituents describing the structure; finally, it compares this structure with those allowed by the phrase structure rules.","When errors are discovered during the processing, various sorts of comments are printed and followed if possible by a partial or full tree of the sentence. When updating is done, the tree is printed and the program VERrFACATEUR passes control to LING. The following illustrations concern first, the program VERIHCATEUR and second, an example of an updated tree and structure.","6. INFORMATION PATTERN BETWEEN LING AND THE TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR TESTERS","Each time LING receives the control from VERIFICATEUR, that is, when no further errors have been detected, it loops in order to call successively the monitors CYCLI ql .... , CYCLI Q9 which contain up 45 different rules; we suppose that we are working now with a specific version of a grammar. The first of these monitors has the following structure. Transformational rule # 1 Transformational rule # 2 Transformational rule # 3 Transformational rule # 4 Transformational rule # 5 Fig. 4. The cYcLI Q1 program","When CYCLI Q1 gets control, it is botmd to the application of 7'1, • .., Ts which correspond to the first five transformational rules; then control is switched to LING which calls cYCLI Q2. The programs CYCLI qn process cyclic rules and the output structure is the input structure for the following rule. When all the cyclic rules have been applied to the input structure, LING starts over again at CYCLI Q1. If no modifications 126 SERGE BOISVERT- ANDR~ DUGAS- DENISE BI~LANGER to the already processed structures occur, or if new errors are discovered, control returns to LING.","After all the cyclic rules have been applied, the post-cyclic rules are processed in a similar manner: cYcu qA comprises the first five post-cyclic rules CYCLI Q~, the five following, and so on.","This chart illustrates the general interaction between the programs for the processing of cyclic or post-cyclic rules."]},{"title":"I_","paragraphs":["cYcI.t Q1 cYcu Q2 CYCI, I Q9 CYCLI QA"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["CYCLI QB cYC~i Qi I End Fig. 5.
