SMITH - EDWARD MAXWELL AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY","FOR","COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC PROCESSING SYSTEMS 1. INTRODUCTION","R. F. SIMMONS (1970) and M. PA~AK and A. W. PRATT (1971) point out that no computerized system using natural language either as part of the processor or as the object processed and having a syntactico-semantic component has a lexicon of more than a few hundred items (except for the SNOV' s medical lexicon). It is obvious from the lack • of success of large-scale computerized systems using natural language data that better solutions will be reached if these systems have a large lexicon as an integra.1 component. Our purpose is to build a large scale dictionary 1 of English which will incorporate important recent research into language structure and which will have the potential of being used either as part of a computerized natural language-using system or as a large data base, itself a source for further syntactico-semantic studies.","There are a number of specific problems that anyone who constructs a large-scale computerized dictionary must resolve. First, as discussed in B,. N. SMITH (1972) and P. B. GovE (1972), a computerized dictionary must incorporate additional types of data than is available in standard dictionaries. Since standard dictionaries and some of their computerized counterparts define words in terms of other words, they are of necessity circular. In addition, the efficiency of any system will depend on the size and form of the dictionary. Any usable large-scale dictionary of English probably would have to contain at least 200,000 entries (including inflected forms).","1 We distinguish lexicon and dictionary by considering an entry in the latter as being the same information as the corresponding entry in the former but with added definition. 304 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL","If each entry is defined as in a standard dictionary with, say, 20 words used in the definition then there must be storage for 4,000,000 words. In addition if, as has been proposed in N. CHOMSlIY (1965), each entry has syntactico-semantic features attached we will encounter a similar problem: entries probably need on the average 20 features to specify them. Finally, when words are arbitrarily stored in computer systems, with pointers directing the search from word to word (cf. M. R. QmL-LIAN, 1968), the search algorithm can be long.","With all of these problems in mind, we have defined a theoretical model which we expect will eliminate or substantially reduce these very real limitations of computerized dictionaries discussed above. The purpose of our research is to implement the scheme, so that it may be used in artificial intelligence systems; as a data base for computer assisted instruction systems (e.g. PLATO), and as a tool for lexical testing (cf. J. OLNEY, D. R.aMSEY, 1972) and information retrieval (e.g. cf. C. SALTON, 1971; W. A. WOODS, 1972). 2. LEXICAL INFORMATION","Until recently much of the interesting research in lexicology has been carried out in the Soviet Union. The Soviets have long been concerned with automated language processing and attribute the lack of success at this task to the lack of a sophisticated lexical theory. Dictionaries are quite inadequate in giving Us insight into the nature of words. There is no way, for example, that one could learn a language using a dictionary. In addition, definitions in dictionaries are circular: every word is defined in terms of every other word (actually approximately 50 % of the vocabulary appears in the definitions (JOHN OLNEY, personal communication)).","Some of the most innovative research in Soviet lexicology has been carried out by 2olkovsky, Mel'~uk and Apresjan (cf. A.K. 2OLKOVSKY and I. A. MEL'~UX, 1970, YU. D. API~SJAN, 1967, and Yu. D. AP~- SJAN, I. A. MEL'&m and A. D. 2OLKOVSKY, 1969). Initially, they felt that the detailed syntactic properties of a word composed its meaning -","in a structural rather than substantive sense. Their approach was first to classify words using grammatical criteria; for example, Apresjan classified verbs as being able to undergo the passive transformation or as being able or unable to take a complementary infinitive, accusative objects or locative adverbial phrases. \"~w~--W=*~e~m.~ =,~ ~ xf--..-~-~,--., ~- -,~ ,--- ~-, ~ ~--...~,~ ...... ~- .~,---,.7=~ ., ~ ~ AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 305","Their theory is essentially a structuralist one. In one of their studies they proposed a revision of the notion \"word field \". That is, their lexico-structural analysis begins with an enumeration of the phrase types of a language, revealed by syntactic analysis; an indication of the frequency of each of the structural patterns; and finally an enumeration of the word meanings found in each pattern.","In Yu. D. APRESJAN, I. A. MEL'~UK and A. D."]},{"title":"2OLKOVSKY","paragraphs":["(1969) and elsewhere they propose that a dictionary which displays \"the process of text generation as an integral succession of steps\" be constructed. They state that the dictionary should be based on the following principle:","... it must be fully sufficient for a smooth, idiomatic and flexible expression of a given meaning; that is to say, it must display in an explicit and logical form whatever information may be necessary for the correct choice and usage of words and phrases to convey a given idea in a speech context.","The proposed dictionary is \"combinatory\" because \"it is primarily","intended to d!splay the combinatorial properties of words. \" It is \"ex-","planatory\" because the syntactic government patterns are semantically","interpreted with the goal of providing idiomatic expression of any","given meaning.","The typical entry in their dictionary would have the following","format: a) Entry word b) Morphological information c) Definition d) Syntactic potential of word e) Regular lexical functions f) Non-regular lexical functions g) The \"lexical universe\" of entry 11) Examples i) Phraseology (idiomatic expressions) . j) Discrimination of synonyms and near-synonyms.","Concerning the definition (c), they specify that they not be circular. They state that \"if this requirement is met, all the definitions will in the long run be reduced to a small number of indefinable units of meaning (elementary meanings). \" (This is the same goal as the UCLA lexicography project.) An example of this can be found in McCawley's 20 306 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL work with lexical atoms (J. MCCAWLEY, 1968). That is, redden has the semantic atoms \" cause to come to be red. \" It is important to note that the definition of a word should be an exact paraphrase of the word using these semantic atoms.","The notion of lexical functions is the principle innovation of their dictionary. Lexical function involves establishing relationships between words. Examples from Yu. D. APRESJAN, I, A. MEL'~UX and A. D. ~OLKOVSHY (1969) are the following:"]},{"title":"(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6).","paragraphs":["(12)"]},{"title":"(15) (18) (31)","paragraphs":["Syn=synonym Syn (to help) - to aid Syn (to call) - to name Conv-conversive Cony (to build) - to be built (by someone) Cony (to contain) - to be contained (by something) Cony (A precedes B)- B follows A Cony (A beat 13) - B loses to A Cony (A sold B to C) - C bought B from A Anti-antonym Anti (beautiful) - plain, ugly Anti (before) - after Gen - genus Gen (liquid) - substance Gen (blue) - color Gen (crawl) - move So-noun coinciding with the verb So (to move) - movement So (to be white) - whiteness Ao-adjectives coinciding with the verb Ao (sun) - solar Ao (time) - temporal Sinstr-noun denoting instrument of word Sinstr (think) - brain Sinstr (clap) - hands Mult-noun denoting aggregate Mult (flowers) - bunch Mult (sheep) - flock Figur-standard figurative designation Figur (passion) - flame Figur (misery) - abyss Oper-verb connecting name of participant with action oper (support) - to lend oper (defeat) - to suffer AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 307 (39) (46) oper (recession) - to experience Fin-verb meaning \" to cease \", \" to stop \" Fin (sound) - to die away Fin (patience) - to lose Son-verb denoting typical sound Son (lion) - to roar Son (snake) - to hiss","What they mean by information about the lexical universe of a word is \"an informal description of a suflqciendy broad piece of reality including the given situation as a constituent element. \" For example, the lexical universe of student would include such lexical items as books, classes, college, instructor, study, exam and so on.","Finally, description of near synonyms would involve a listing of all words connected to a lexical item by connotations. Connotations involve, of course, literary and emotional overtones of words. A terrorist is, for example, a guerrilla whose cause we have emotional disagreement with.","Their notion of syntactic potential corresponds somewhat to Fill-more's case frames. That is, for Fillmore, a dictionary must specify the case potential of words. For example, in the sentences (1)"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["a) John hit the ball with a bat. b) The bat hit the ball. c) John hit the window with the ball. d) *John hit the window with the ball with the bat. e) *The window hit. a) John broke the window with the ball. b) The ball broke the window. c) The window broke. d) The ball broke the window. bodl hit and broke can have agents as subject.

And all of this information comes under \"syntactic potential. \"","Fillmore's current (C. J. FILLMORE, 1970) \" cases \" are agent, experiencer, instrument object, source, goal, place, time, and extent. The syntactic potential of a word (in the sense of AVa~SJAN et al., 1969) determines the case of a lexical item (and the case frame of a verb). For example, in the sentences 308 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL","(3) a) *Personally, I'm sixty-five. b) Personally, I'm happy. the reason for the non-bizarreness of (b) is that the subject of be happy must be an \"experiencer \".

In particular, C. J. FrrtMOm~ (1969, p. 109) feels that the lexicon must make accessible to the user","(i) the nature of the deep-structure syntactic environments into","which the item may be inserted;","(ii) the properties of the item to which the rules of grammar are","sensitive;","(iii) for an item that can be used as a \" predicate \", the number'","of \" arguments \" that it conceptually requires;","(iv) the role(s) which each argument plays in the situation which","the item, as predicate, can be used to indicate;","(v) the presuppositions or \"happiness conditions\" for the use of","the item, the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the item to be","used \" apdy \";","(vi) the nature of the conceptual or morphological relatedness of","the item to other items in the lexicon;","(vii) its meaning; and","(viii) the phonological or orthographic shapes which the item as-","sumes under given grammatical conditions.","Although dictionaries are the most popular way to define words, there are other ways than dictionaries for specifying the meanings 2 of a word within a certain lexical system. For example, U. WmNP, r~CH ~(1963), in his review of Soviet semantic research, speaks of three ways • of specifying word-meanings:","It should be clear that we are not using the term ' me.aning' and ' definition' synonomously. AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 309 1) by lexicographic definition (like the dictionary); 2) by locating the lexical item in a synonym system; 3) by establishing the syntactic properties of the lexical items.","Point (1) has been discussed above. As for point (2) M. MINSKY (1968) has a few interesting comments on the possibility of constructing a thesaurus-like dictionary (which would be, in effect, a synonym dictionary):","My thesis is simply that we must not try to evade the' thesaurus problem' just because we (rightly) can never be satisfied with any particular thesaurus. We must still learn how to build them, and find ways to make machines first to use them, then to modify them, and eventually to build for themselves new and better ones (p. 27).","There has been much recent research in current linguistic theory with respect to Weinreich's third way of analyzing a terminological system, by syntactic characterization of words. The J. FreEDMAN (1971) computerized lexicon included information about the types of transformations that a word can undergo as well as some rudimentary semantic information (in the form of features). Other information that has not been included in computerized systems to any great extent are such notions as \"factivity \" (as defined by P. IfivARSKY and C. KIPARSKY, 1970) and notions of \"genericity \" and \"specificity \" (as discussed in R. JACK~NDOrF, 1973). Another important syntactic development that has found its way into lexical systems is \"case structure\" as mentioned earlier and as elaborated in C. J. FILLMO~ (1968, 1969, 1971), R. P. STOCKW~LL et al. (1973). Most of these interesting and important facts of language have not been incorporated into computerized or standard dictionaries.","An additional type of information to be included in a lexicon should be the non-discrete syntactic and semantic features proposed by Ross and by Lakoff. Both linguists, working in syntax and semantics, respectively, have discovered variable acceptability of syntactic and semantic features within a given structure. Lakoffproposes to account for this variable strength probabilistically, basing his research on results from the theory of fuzzy sets. In our work on interactive lexicon construction, we have found a variation in responses due, we presumed, to regional, social, psychological and perhaps chronological differences. This probabilistic information, measured in response time, should also be included in a lexicon as information pertinent to utterance understanding and production. 310 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL 3. CONTENTS OF THE LEXICON","The purpose of this section is to describe in specific detail what our dictionary will look like and how we plan to incorporate the data discussed in the previous section.","First, we propose to tag the following syntactico-semantic information on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs which we assume to be crucial: for every lexical entry in each part of speech we will record:","1) Entry word.","2) Part of speech.","3) Semantic field.","4) Dictionary definition.","5) Irregular inflectional morphology.","6) Derivational morphology.

The purpose of this will in part be to be able to relate lexical entries from the same root.)","7) Synonyms including synonymous cross-references (available from NIH research group) plus annotations from synonym paragraphs in the Webster's Dictionary.

METHODOLOGY","The plan for the dictionary is to produce a core English lexicon consisting of the 20,000 most frequent words listed in H. KU~ERA and W. N. FRANCIS (1967). The reason for choosing these is that in theory they account for 98 ~o of the words in running text.","As described in section 3 we havea very good idea of what to include in the lexicon, although this must obviously be left open-ended. There are problems of division of labor, however: that is, how can we most efficiently capture the information that we want to include. We have narrowed the various possible ways down to three: 1) by hand (including a real time text editing scheme) 2) interactively 3) by automated processing of a standard dictionary. : Method (1) is obvious. As for method (2) Olney (J. OLNEY, D. RAMSEY, 1973, p. 16) says, \" what better source than the disambiguated parsed [= formatted] transcripts of W 7 and MPD [The Merriam Pocket Dictionary, which is also on tape] is there likely to be in the near future for obtaining semantic data pertaining to the English vocabulary as a whole? \". We feel that there is a better source, at least for the kinds of information that we are interested in, and that is the native speaker of English. lk. N. SMITH (1972) describes a way of obtaining this data 314 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL interactively (in a system which has been described by R. L. WmMANN (1972, p. 9) as \" one of the most successful projects currently under way \") and the reader should consult that work for details.","As to method (3) we have been influenced by the work of one of the largest groups and one of the most potentially successful groups involved in automating the process of lexicon construction from standard dictionaries, viz., the user's group emanating from the Lexicographic Project headed by JoaN OI.NtY of the Institute of Library Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Systems Development Corporation.

Since then collaboration with over 30 researchers at various institutions has led to the creation of approximately 50 data sets derived from the dictionary transcript.

Some of this has been relatively successful but based on the scope and the methods used, it is clear that still a great deal more time and effort will have to be expended.","Some of the already existent derived data sets are useful.

In addition all synonomous cross-references have been extracted, alphabetized on the main entry form and on the word referred to. Also, there are various suffixal data sets used in aiding to correlate suffmes with definitions.","Samples of print-out for sorted definitions within part of speech and end-alphabetized within part of speech are appended.

STRUCTURING THE DATA","The innovation that we propose to implement in this computerized dictionary that will allow us to structure and store all of the information discussed above efficiently and accurately is that of the \"semantic field. \" The theory of semantic fields is not new; what is new is the use of this concept to structure semantic information. Its most appealing characteristic is that it eliminates the need for redundant information (the problem with the feature approach which is widely used) and it makes retrieval much more efficient. First we will discuss the motivation for such a system as a model for semantic structure.","Some of the most interesting empirical evidence for semantic fields has been in work done by Marshall and Newcombe in psycholinguistics and by Whitaker, Kehoe, Schnitzer and others in neuro-linguistics. H. A. WmTAKER (1971) has described the remarkable correspondence of the distinct cellular arrays in the cortex of the brain to the classical divisions of the language system: the semantic/syntactic component, the lexicon, and the phonological component.","For example, it has been found that the lexicon has an existence apart from the syntactic-semantic (or logical) aspects of language.

That the lexicon, a separate component, is organized in some sort of semantic field arrangement was pointed out again and again by Whitaker. In work done by E. WEIGL and M. BIERWISCH (1970), they described errors which were the results of substitutions of words for other words from the same semantic fields; e.g.,"]},{"title":"trousers","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"blouse, tie","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"cuff, bodice","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"cardigan, sandals","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"socks, peaches","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"oranges, bananas","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"figs, potatoes","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"vegetables.","paragraphs":["Of particular note is that the substitutions usually occur at the .same taxonomic level, that is, the substitution is rarely an 316 RAOUL N.
