Introduction.","A program for the syntactic analysis of French text has been developed which is used in conjunction with a string grammar of French 1 and a dictionary of the grammatical properties of the words in the sentences analyzed. The program has been written in fORTRAN SO that it can be used on any computer having a rORTaAN compiler. It has been tested on the IBM 360-91 at the Centre d'Etudes Nucl&ires in Saclay, and on the IBM 370-165 at the computing center of the C.N.P,.S. in Orsay and yields satisfactory analyses of sentences in a reasonable computing time.","The analyses obtained for the first eight sentences of a text by Jacob and Monod in molecular biology are presented in the figures of the appendix. My object in this paper is to discuss what semantic data have been incorporated in the string grammar in order to produce these analyses and to prevent other false analyses from being obtained. A discussion of certain features of these analyses, as well as of those analyses not obtained, will bring out the nature of the semantic data that I have in mind. The text analyzed is reproduced in Fig. 1, and the analyses in the figures that follow. 1. The analyses.

P N2 = ~ celui d'un mammif~re This is analogous to the use ofprovoquer in sentences like (22) On a provoqud Pierre [~ la violence / ~ un acte d~sdspdr~/ ...] But provoquer belongs to a subclass of verbs, V15, which require a human or human-like noun in the position of N1 : (23) *On a provoqud la table ~ une chute brutale A restriction then disallows la conversion.., in the position N1 of (21). 2. The semantic data.","From the analyses presented above, we see that two distinct types of semantic data are incorporated in the grammar. (1) A subclass of some major grammatical class cannot appear in a given position. This was the case for the verb subclasses V15 and V16, which require a human noun in one of the positions of their NP N object; for the noun object of ~tre, which can drop the article only if the noun is in the subclass N17; and for the object of verbs like confirmer, ddmontrer, ... which cannot be a concrete noun. (2) Some sequence of conjoined strings is not possible for given values of one of the strings or of some subclass appearing in the strings. Thus, the two conjoined nouns in the sequence (sentenceJM-1) depuis N1 et N~ may both be nominalizations, time nouns, or concrete nouns, but not one of each kind. 404 MORRIS SALKOFF","Another example was seen in the sentence JM-4 where the conjunction of dissimilar objects of a verb is ungrammatical. These two examples illustrate the problem of the conjunction of classes and strings which is not solved for the general case.","The interesting point is that these two types of semantic restrictions are of the same nature as the syntactic restrictions and are incorporated in the grammar in the same way as the latter. This means that there is no need for a semantic component, or for semantic considerations that are completely separate from the usual grammatical procedures. The definition of subclasses is required in any case by the grammar, e.g. for the syntactic subclasses (singular, plural .... ); and the specification of the conjoinability of given sequences (strings) is required in order to treat conjunctions. In this way, the semantic component becomes part of the syntax and is incorporated without any special mechanism, The same type of restriction as that which forbids *Pierre sont ici or *L'homme est courageuse is used to prevent the analyzer from presenting a sequence such as *provoquer la table ~ la violence.","Hence I extend this use to semantic subclasses. Some of these subclasses can be defined syntactically, e.g., N17, but in any case they are sometimes used to exclude sequences that are not necessarily syntactically forbidden. These sequences do not violate any rules of the grammar, but violate what is usually called a selection rule or a semantic constraint.","To the extent that these semantic constraints, or selection rules, can in fact be formulated, the formulation can probably always be stated in one of the ways (1) or (2) given above. If this is true, then the syntactic analyzer based on string grammar which I have presented here can incorporate semantics as well as syntax. Two difficulties in this formulation via subclasses immediately present themselves:","a) The subclass itself is difficult to define, e.g., the subclass human or human-like which is needed to define V15 and V16, or the subclass ~ concrete ~ noun.","b) The decision as to whether a given word does in fact belong to some subclass is not always easy to make. In the discussion of JM-2, I said that apjoorter belongs to the subclass V15, and this is how apporter is presendy coded in the dictionary. There are however well-formed sentences in which the N1 P N~ object of apporter has a non-human noun in the position N~: (24) J'apporterai une solution au probl~me ON USING SEMANTIC DATA IN AUTOMATIC SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS 405 but this seems to be limited to pairs of nouns standing in some relationship to each other, as"]},{"title":"solution","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"probl~me.","paragraphs":["This relationship is very hard to define, since other pairs of nouns, seemingly related in a similar fashion, do not yield well-formed sentences with"]},{"title":"apporter: (25)","paragraphs":[",J'ai app0rtb un"]},{"title":"pied ~ la chaise","paragraphs":["But these difficulties are not specific to the analyzer nor to the string grammar that I use; rather, they are independent of the parsing strategy - no matter what the analyzer - and will be solved, if indeed they can be solved, by more detailed research into the linguistic problems involved. From a practical point of view, this uniform treatment of the semantic and the syntactic data leads to a more compact granunar and a simpler analyzer than one containing separate semantic and syntactic components. Only semantically and syntactically correct analyses are furnished by such an analyzer, as is desired, and this is of prime importance for later applications of the analyzer to the problems of automatic translation or automatic documentation. 406 MORRIS SALKOFF","MI~CANISMES BIOCHIMIQUES ET GI~N~TIQUES DE LA R.~GULATION DANS LA CELLULE BACTI~RIENNE par Francois Jacob et Jacques MONOD.
