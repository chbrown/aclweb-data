MOTIVATION AND BASIC IDEAS","Since 1972 a researcher team in Bonn has been working on the automatic syntax-analysis of the german language. The morphoJogical analysis is a part of this work that has already been formalized and programmed by the author. We can consider the following paper as a generalization of this formalized description.","In this first chapter some expressions like \"text\" or \"lexicon \" are considered clear by intuition. Later on we'll get to know the exact definitions. The basis of each description of a text of any language is a morphological analysis of this text. One can easily agree that such a description has to be derived from the words or sentences of the text which is to be described. The expression \"description of a text\" is understood in a very general sense.. One can imagine a syntactic description or a semantic interpretation or a combination of both of them or any other information.","In a natural language the number of the possible texts is not finite. That's easy to prove because of the following sentences: One is a number Two is a number","Hence it's impossible in practice to use a lexicon of the following form text 1 description of text 1 text 2 description of text 2","o,w °.° 10 ~rERNER BRECHT for all texts of a language. There remains only one possibility. One has to ascribe the words and sequences of words which every text consists of with one or more (homography) descriptions. Then one can try to derive the descriptions of the text out of the descriptions of the words or sequences of words. 2. BASIC DEFINITIONS 2.1. Remark. Let A and B be sets. Then denotes: P(A) : the set of all subsets of A (the powerset of A) A* : the free monoid over A A × B: the cartesian product of A and B I xl : the \"length\" of x ~ A* (the number of elements of A","which x consists of);I xl ~ IN.","Now we'll define the expressions \"character \" and \"string\" for a language. We use five basic sets: LETT := {A, B, G, ..., Z} the set of \"letters \" DIG := {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} the set of \" digits \" BLANK: = {L_a} =: {blank},/t._a/= 1, I_..a E BLANK* PS : = {.} U {,} U { !} U ... the set of \"punctuation-signs \" SS := {%, &, ~, ...} the set of \" special-signs\" From these five sets we derive:","a) CHAR: = LETTU DIG U BLANKU PS U SS the set of","\"characters\" If x ~ CHAR, we say: \"x is a character \". b) CHAR*: the free monoid over CHAR.","If x ~ CHAR*, we say: \"x is a string \"","or: x is a sequence of characters\"","or: x is a text \" c) LISS: = LETTO DIG U SS the set of \"Characters without","blank and punctuation-signs\" d) LISS*: the free monoid over LISS.","If x ~ LISS*, we say: \"x is a string without blank and punc-","tuation-signs \".
