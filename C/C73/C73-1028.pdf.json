FEASIBILITY STUDY","The feasibility study on fully automatic high quality translation was held in 1971 under the auspices of the Linguistics Research Center of The University of Texas at Austin with support from KAFB. The participants were twenty experts in the areas of linguistics and computer software, representing a wide range of opinions on the feasibility of MT. Among the recommendations made in the report on this study was one regarding the need of \"lexical research to determine the syntactic and semantic patterns of linguistic entities \". The result of such research would be a dictionary containing, in addition to lexical information, syntactic and semantic features and restrictors necessary for quality translation. Ill this paper, I would like to describe some of the work which is currently being done at the Linguistics Research Center to-ward such a dictionary. 2.

Both of these dictionaries indicate the different readings of a lexical item separately, according to syntactic and/or semantic criteria. Therefore, our initial lists already contained a small amount of syntactic and semosyntactic information, such as human vs. non-human subjects or objects required by verbs?","We began with the German and English verb lists primarily to find out the general types of selection restrictions of these verbs and to use this information as the basis of our classification of nouns and adjectives. In this way, we compiled the following lists:","a) A German verb list with English translation equivalents. This list contains approximately 17,500 entries.

Basically, the system comprises three types of features: the properties of the classified element itself; the properties of the environment in which it may occur wellformedly; and information pertaining to the subject area to which a lexical element or one of its semantic readings might be restricted.","a) The features of the element itself are its syntactic category, its possible discontinuous elements, such as separable verbal prefixes in German and adpreps in English, and its semantic sub-classification.","b) The selection restriction of the classified element indicate the syntactic and semantic restrictions on obligatory and optional compl e - ments, mostly of verbs, adjectives, and prepositions, but also of some nouns and adverbs.","The features of the lexical element and also its selection restrictions are indicated as values of subscripts, the latter being generalizations of the features.

Specific Features.","At this point I would like to outline briefly what the specific syntactic and semo-syntactic features are which are, at present, being assigned to lexical entries. 2.4.1. Nouns.","The list of nouns contains mostly the features of the nouns themselves and only few selection restrictions. They are subclassified according to the requirements of verbs, adjectives, and prepositions, but not according to logical distinctions or a subclassification of the universe. In other words, we are not interested in real distinctions but in the distinctions made in the language. The two are not always the same, as the classification of the English noun novel might show. A novel is normally considered an abstract, yet we have to classify it, in addition, as inanimate physical object because one speaks of a novel meaning the book or stack of papers on which it is printed. Thus we say: Hand me that novel. Don't sit on my novel! etc.","The basic semantic noun classes we have established are abstract, human, animal, plant, and inanimate physical object. To these, a number of additional markers can be added as relevant. These are: title (for items like Mr., Dr., etc., which can be followed by proper names); name (for frequently occurring proper names); body part (because of verbs like amputate and because the German definite article preceding nouns denoting body parts is replaced by a possessive pronoun in English); machine (because many verbs which normally require a human subject can also take a machine as a subject); mass (because these may be used without an article in the singular); collective (because such nouns can be used with verbs which otherwise require plural subjects or subjects, as e.g. disperse : the crowd dispersed, they dispersed, but not *the man dispersed; in English such nouns are frequently referred to by plural pronouns: The government is in agreement; they are expected to release their decision soon.); quantity (for nouns like glass, half, per-BEYOND THE FEASIBILITY STUDY: LEXICOGRAPHIC PROGRESS 329 cent, dozen, etc., which oan occur in the frame a ~ (of) NP, where they act as the syntactic but not the semantic head of the noun phrase construction); time (a sub-class of abstract; these nouns can take a when-relative clause); count (abstracts which are preceded by a definite article, such as idea, event, as opposed to those abstracts which may be used in the singular without an article, e.g. mathematics, love, etc. ; the latter type is unmarked); unit (abstracts like mile, year, etc., which fit into the frame NP= QUANT+ ~., the whole noun phrase being a quantitative adverb, as in/~e mites long; this allows us to analyze only these noun phrases as adverbs, instead of considering every NP a possible adverbial, which would cause a large number of incorrect readings).","Some nouns also have ~election restrictions, mostly prepositional objects or clauses. Examples are dependence (on), fact (that). The required syntactic form of such complements is indicated as that-clause, marked or unmarked infinitive, gerund, for-to phrase, interrogative adverb plus clause, specific prepositions, and possible combinations of these. For prepositional objects, the semantic type of the noun within the prepositional phrase in also indicated as one of the semantic noun classes mentioned earlier. To indicate semantic selection restrictions, the basic semantic noun classes are combined in tree form as shown E","PO NT AB (ph);sical object) (intangible (abstt'act)","/~ physical"]},{"title":"\"~jcct)","paragraphs":["AN PL IN (plant) (inanimate physical","object) HU AL (human) (animal) 330 ANNETTE STACHOWITZ Each node of the tree may be used as a selection restriction in order to save enumeration of all noun types which are permitted for a particular complement. Sub-classes of adverbs are also used as semantic selection restrictions.","Since we have no derivational analysis as yet and therefore cannot mechanically recognize the underlying verbs of deverbative nouns, we have one additional noun feature, indicating optional directional adverbs which may function as complements of some noun; example: the trip to Peking, the flight to the moon. This feature is needed for correct analysis and prevention of forced readings in strings like They described the trip to the South Pole. vs. They transported .these items to the South Pole., where the adverb modifies the noun in the first, the verb in the second sentence. 2.4.2. Verbs.","Verbs and adjectives are assigned mostly selection restrictions. Only two features in our verb lists describe the verb itself. The first of these is PX (for \"prefix \"), in which slot we spell out the specific separable prefix or adprep with which a verb may occur. All other features refer to the combination verb stem + prefix or adprep. The second verb feature which is not a selection restriction is \" type \", which only indicates, redundantly, whether the verb is transitive, intransitive, or reflexive; also indicated are the small classes of transitive verbs which may not be passivized and of English verbs which do not form the progressive.","Verb selection restrictions are syntactic form and semantic type of subject and objects required; multiple objective are indicated by a \" + \" and given in the order direct object - indirect object. All possible types of complements are indicated except, of course, the free ones, such as the benefactive dative, adverbial infinitive phrases, etc. (For a list of syntactic complement markers, cf. p. 329; verbs and adjectives may also have features indicating NP complements, with case indication in German).
