Numerals in some other languages, such as English, German, French, Danish, Burmese, Hausa and Urdu will be touched upon briefly. In particular we are interested in rule systems (algorithms) that automatically convert mathematical representations into linguistic representations (numerals) or vice versa. Our interest in this area is part of a wider interest in Automatic Text Comprehension, 1 which in turn is part of the areas Automat-ical Language Translation and Artificial Intelligence. The study is focusing on problems that are due to the structure of numerals in (natural) languages. The technical problems that turn up when conversion rules are to be implemented on computer are not treated in this exploratory study.","The practical applications of rule systems that convert mathematical representations into numerals or vice versa are automatic devices or robots of various types, e.g. the \"automatic stock market announcer \", the \"automatic cashier \", the \"automatic accountant \", the","1 This work is related to the project ATC (Automatic Text Comprehension) of The Institute of Linguistics, University of Stockholm, which is supported by Humanistiska Forskningsr¢tdet.

The automatic telephone directory would give you the number, if you furnish the name and address of a person. The system would have to identify the person by processes that correpond to optical and manual search in a directory. In the register of the directory the system would find the number and could pronounce it according to rules to be discussed later.","The automatic directory would require phonetic identification procedures that have not been developed fully yet, at least not for large inventories of possible messages. In societies where numbers play an increasing role - telephone numbers, registration numbers, addresses, social security numbers, bank account numbers, zip codes - systems that can identify and pronounce numbers are getting increasingly interesting. Current experiences suggest that any conversation with robots has to take place within heavy constraints.","Further examples of machines that could use the rule systems under discussion would include warning systems, systems that read the values of meters (temperature, altitude, humidity) aloud. A system that reads the speed of the car aloud or tells you the distance of an approaching crossing etc. in a mild but distinct voice might have certain advantages in difficult traffic situations. Presently almost all warning systems, traffic signs and signals, use optical signals. If acoustic signals are used they are not speech signals, only rings or buzzes. The human voice and the human language may have a certain attraction to human beings. Imagine the \"speaking alarm clock\" which tells you the time and reads the temperature etc. in an attractive (re)male voice available as an option.","In most of the applications mentioned so far pronunciation has been involved. But systems of a simpler kind, which rewrite mathematical (decimal) number representations as numerals (in letters) would certainly also be useful. Banks and Post offices use numbers written both in mathematical and linguistic form, presumably because of the need for redundancy and security. This is at least the case in Sweden. It is required that a number, e.g. 1055 be written with letters as well as with figures. But these are almost our only opportunities for writing high numbers with letters.

FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 431","There are many previous studies related to the problems under focus here, e.g. CORSTIUS (1968) where marly general problems are treated starting from Dutch, and C.-CH. ELERT (1970) where the morphology of Swedish numerals is treated. We have used presentations and analyses of numerals in various languages. But it is only for Swedish that our rules are outlined in any detail. The other languages are treated to indicate what problems one would have to face in an automatic translation system for numerals. A system that translates between mathematical representations and representations in Swedish, English, French, German (and a couple of other languages) will be implemented on computer in the near future.","We will work with written forms in this study. Unfortunately it is not the case that such representations could be run through a speech synthesizer giving beautiful pronunciation. Nor are there any speech recognition devices that can render large or infinite inventories of spoken numerals as written ones presently. A forthcoming study by DE SERVA-LEIT.~O will shed light on the phonetic problems. Till then this examination of some of the fundamental problems may be of some importance. Some issues of interest to theoretical linguistics will also turn up. 2. MATHEMATICAL AND LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF NUMBERS","Representations of numbers using digits (figures) will be called mathematical representations, while representations using letters (sounds) organized in morphemes, words and phrases as other linguistic material will be called linguistic representations.

In the extreme case each digit is treated separately.","We will call the different divisions of the group of digits different fusion. We can show the differences as follows: 123, 12 + 3, 1 + 23, 432 BENGT SIGURD 1 + 2 + 3. The first case implies total fusion, since the whole series of digits is taken into consideration. The last case implies no fusion; cases in between may be characterized as partial fusion. We might call the case where the digits are treated separately spelling, since this is the word used when a word is decomposed in letters and each letter is spoken separately. In Swedish we could devise a new word siffrering (\" digitalization \") as an equivalent of bokstavering and stavning which mean rendering each letter by its name. Spelling (bokstavering), e.g. rendering the word bad as be-a-de, is often used for names and other words with low redundancy. Military forces would use special letter names with more redundancy, in Swedish for bad: Bertil, Adam, David.","The following is a table showing mathematical and linguistic representations of numbers. The linguistic representations are Swedish numerals according to different fusion. We are mainly interested in the relations between decimal representations and linguistic ones, but for some lower numbers binary and t(oman representations are given. We will touch on the problem of pronouncing binary representations briefly. The relations between Koman mathematical representations and Latin numerals are interesting but very complicated, and we will not suggest any conversion rules for those representations here.","Mathematical Linguistic","representation representation Normal (total Technical (partial","Koman Decimal fusion) or no fusion)","I 2 tvd tvd(a)","XI 11 elva at-at","XII 12 tolv ett-tvd","CCCIX 309 rrehundranio tre-noll-nio","4378 fyratusentre- fyra-tre-sju-dtta, hundrasjuttio- fyrtiotre-sjuttio-dtta dtta","121457 etthundratjugo- ett-tvd-ett-fyraentusen fyra- fem-sju, tolv-fjortonhundrafemtlo- femtiosju, etthundra-sju tjugoett-fyrahundra-","femtiosju","123456789 etthundratjugo- ett-tvd-tre-fyra-fem-tre millioner sex-sju-dtta-nio, ett-fyrahundrafemtio- hundratjugotre-fyra-sex tusen sju- hundrafemtiosex-sju-hundradttionio hundradttionio","Binary","10 1011 1100 FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 433","The fundamental difference between fused and non-fused expressions is the presence of position words: -tio(-ton), hundra, tusen, million ... in fused forms. The etymology of such words might be far from the decimal system. It is well known that there often are rival systems, above all the 20-system (vigesimal), the 12-system (cf. dussin, gross) and the 5-system (quinary). Many ways of grouping items may seem natural.","There are no position words associated with the positions of binary representations, but considering the popularity of the binary system in the computer age one might suggest some, e.g. duo (or pair) for position 2 (counting from the right), quartet for position 3 (23) and octet for position 3 (28). Using these position words (group names) the number 11 (eleven), which is 1011 in binary form would be: (one) octet one duo one. We might alternatively construct new position words for the positions of binary numbers. One way would be to use the decimal words rio, hundra etc., changing them, by substituting b for the first letter, into bi(o), bunclra, busen, billion, billiard ('). In this system 12 (twelve), which is 1100 in binary form, would be: busenbundra. Since binary representation tends to get very long, an enormous number of position words would be needed. We refrain from developing further binary numerals.","The choice of fusion form is apparently depending on the use of the number. The number 121457 is a telephone number. Such numbers are often divided into 2-groups, but 3-groups or separate pronunciation of each figure also occurs. It is a well-known fact that such high telephone numbers are difficult to get through correctly. In practice one introduces pauses at strategic points to facilitate communication.","We will not discuss the communicative and mnemonic advantages of different systems here. Let us just mention that there are at least some cases, where the totally fused numerals give shorter expressions, e.g. en million compared to ett-noll-noll-noll-noll-noll-noll. The last example with all the zeros (noll) is probably difficult to get through over the telephone, since one might easily lose count. Position words have the advantage of indicating how far to the left we are. They are in a way the equivalents of the zeros used as position fillers in mathematical representations (zeros do not vary according to position). _As is obvious from the table above there are cases where partial or no fusion gives shorter expressions than expressions based on total fusion. It is often said that since there are infinitely many numbers and each number has a name (word, numeral) in the language, there are infinitely many 28 434 ~rNGX $IGURD words in the language.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS","Separate pronunciation of each figure is no great problem, and we will concentrate on total fusion in the following. We begin by presen- .ting the following table where position numbers and position words associated with positions are to be found. The term position word, of course, reflects our looking at the numerals from the point of view of the decimal positional representations. The words could also be called group names or number measures. For reasons of space we have not included any position word higher than milliard.","example: 666","Position number 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6a6261","position value 10g 10 s 10 v 106 105 104 108 102 101 100= 1 6.103 +6.101","+ 6.10 o","position word mill- mill- tu- hun- tio/ sexhundrasex-","lard ion sen dra -ton tiosex","There is no position word for unit in Swedish. One might use stycken (pieces, units), but presumably since position word for units is redundant it is generally left out. As a name for the whole set Swedes use ental, but it is not possible to use en in the numerals, perhaps because en lacks plural. There is no point in stating that en is there in the underlying form but obligatorily deleted. (The numeral en could then be derived by deleting the numeral en before the position word en, which is an optional rule in many cases: (ett)tusen, (ett)hundra. But this seems unnatural sophistication.) 436 BENGT SIGURD","The steps between the higher position words are 108 (1000). We will see examples of languages with different steps later, such as Urdu. The only genuine position words are the first three. They are also Germanic, but they have not always been associated with the decimal system as is done now. Many Swedes would hesitate, when it comes to position words higher than million. Some might also have a feeling that languages use milliard, billion etc. differendy (which is also the case).","The number 666 is represented in three different ways above. Let us call the normal decimal representation: positional decimal, or just decimal as usual. The representation 6.10 ~ + 6.101 + 6.100 may be called: analytic decimal, or just analytic representation, since it analyzes the number into the terms to be added. The terms do not have to be in a certain order or take certain positions. The representation sexhundrasextiosex is called (fused) linguistic representation as before.","Our purpose is to derive linguistic representations from decimal ones but the relations between the analytic (decimal) representation and the linguistic one are also of interest. We will compare generative grammars for the different types of representations briefly.","Decimal representations, the input or output of our conversion rules, may be generated by the following simple generative rules, where N is the number, d is digit.

The parts rio/ton are treated (phonologically) as suffixes and always joined with the preceding number. The units are similarly joined with a preceding term rio (sextiosex), perhaps also with preceding hundra (sexhundrasex). As for higher terms it is hard to know: cases are difficult to come by. (Sexmillionersex or sex millioner sex?) The simple numeral 440 BENGT SIGURD before hundra (the coefficient) may or may not be joined with hundra (sex hundra or sexhundra). The tens may or may not be joined with the preceding position word: sexhundra sextio or sexhundrasextio. In brief, the situation is unclear and detailed studies of usage are needed. Handbooks are conspicuously silent.","Many persons probably join all numerals and write them as one long word as a radical solution in this situation. If conventions are to be introduced, they could easily be formulated within the tree structure suggested by (3b). A simple rule would be the following:join all words within the group G, but no other elements. This rule would introduce spaces where there are deep branchings in the tree. We would get the following division for our example: sex miUioner sexhundrasextiosex tusen sexhundrasextiosex. But it is possible to formulate other conventions if desired. Some languages use the hyphen (--) between certain constituents, as we will see.","The relations between analytic representations and the deep structures described by rules 3a and 3b are fairly simple. Conversion rules operating on analytic representations would have to replace the powers of 10 by proper position words, replace the digits by proper simple numerals etc. Taking the non-analytic decimal representation as input to conversion rules, implies inserting the proper position words, but except for that there is litde difference, We will now focus our interest on automatic conversion schemes.","4. CONVERSION RULES CHANGING MATHEMATICAL INTO SWEDISH REPRESENTATIONS","We are now ready to test conversion rules written as generative rules or instructions of different kinds. We will discuss alternative solutions at some points. We distinguish between two blocks of rules:","I) fusion rules, which insert position words and introduce syntactic structure;","II) lexical rules, which substitute words (simple numerals) for figures (digits).

Translation between two related languages, such as Swedish and English (or all the Germanic languages) could be handled without using decimal representations, since word-for-word translation (and a few additional rules) would suffice. This will be obvious from the following examination, but we will not discuss such conversion rules for pairs of natural languages.","I) Fusion rules for English could operate just like in Swedish.

In Swedish the elements tio (alone), ti(o) in e.g.femtio and ton in e.g.femton are assumed to be manifestations of the same position (word). Intuitively most Swedes certainly associate the first two (tio and -ti(o)). In English the manifestations ten and -teen seem the closest.","English has a hyphen between units and preceding tens (twentyfive; twenty-one thousand). This may be handled by inserting a hyphen before units (the last position) in 3-groups, if tens are preceding. Similarly and must be inserted before tens or units preceded by htmdreds, thousands etc. (250630: two hundred and fifty thousand six hundred and thirty).","Notice that one/a before hundred, thousand and higher words must not be deleted in English.

In the numbers for 11-16 one might distinguish a morpheme ze, which is in fact etymologically related to dix (E. Bouacmz, 1950, p. 68).

Since French only shows some fragments of a different system this is hardly necessary for French. The first block of rules within the lexical block can take care of irregularities.

Restricted knowledge in Burmese makes us hesitate but Burmese numerals seem very simple. They look almost as if they were constructed at the writing-table. The morphological analysis of the words is evident, there are no exceptions, such as our elva and tolv. The morphemes for 1 and 2 have morphophonemic variation (special forms for compound-ing), but except for that there is little morphophonemic variation. The correspondences are direct, and conversion rules should be simple to write. We will only make some further comments.","Burmese seems to have (unanalysable, non-compound) position words for high numbers, such as: 10000, 100 000, 1 000 000, 10 000 000 (unless we are mistaken). Burmese also seems to have a word for unit: hku. In Burmese the unit before 10 in the expression for 10 may option-452 BBNGT $1GURD ally be deleted. We have noted the obligatory deletion of 1 before 10 in several languages and the optional deletion of 1 before 100, 1000 in some languages. Burmese uses hse for + ty as well as + teen (and ten). This has the effect that some words, such as the words for 18 and 80 are minimal pairs: hse.hyi(18): hyi hse(80), at least from a segmental point of view. We do not have such minimal pairs in Swedish because 10 is represented by ton after the units in the teens, and by ti(o) before the units in the other cases. We note that traditional morphemic analysis cannot reasonably treat ton and ti(o) as allomorphs in Swedish, since they contrast as infemtio :femton (cf. C.-CI~. Er~RT, 1970, p. 154). 6.6.

The morpheme for 10 (goma) may optionally appear in the teens. If it is deleted, it seems sha would have to take its place and be considered as a variant (manifestation) of 10. We cannot identify any simple numerals in the words for 20, 30 etc. We might take in as a representative of 10, but the rest has to be treated as a suppletive allomorph of 2, 3, 4 etc. We note that the multiplier (cocfi%icnt) is placed after its position word in numbers such as 2000, 100 000. (Do attributives follow their heads in Hausa?) Note that, as a consequence, the only difference between the words for 100000 and 1100 is the word da.

CONCLUSION","• After this brief survey of numerical systems, we can state that conversion between different representations does not cause great problems. We have mainly worked on written forms and disregarded the phonological problems. Solving the problems in connection with conversion between spoken numerals and decimal representations is very important One might even accept ad hoc solutions, e.g. using prerecorded position words and primary numerals, which are combined according to the rules indicated above - a synthesis based on \"prefab \" elements. 454 BENGT SIGURD","We might sum up the problems we have faced when writing conversion rules as follows:","1) The fit to decimal representation is rarely as good as in Burmese. Deviations concern the use of other base numbers (5, 20, 12) and different order. Special adaption rules may be used in such cases.","2) The order between multiplier (coefficient) and position words varies (as does the order between attributive and head in noun phrases).

The words for 1 and unit are often deleted, but conventions vary between languages.","5) Beside position words and fundamental numerals some languages use additive (or subtractive) morphemes and morphemes meaning multiplication (\" times \"). But most languages rely heavily on order arrangements, which are very economic.","6) Sporadic occurrences of fractions have been attested, e.g. in Danish. Such cases need special treatment. If they are isolated, lexical rules may take care of the matter without any insightful (and etymologically suggestive) rules, at least for practical purposes.","7) The conventions for joining numerical morphemes vary very much between languages and so does the use of hyphen. The rules can probably always be explained on the basis of (assumed) constituent structure.","8) The pronunciation of numerals above all long numerals can presumably be predicted on the basis of segmental structure and tree structure.
