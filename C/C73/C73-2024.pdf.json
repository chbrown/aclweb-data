Introduction.","Today, owing to the growing diffusion of on-line processing facilities, the automatic processing of textual data, i.e. of information expressed in natural language, becomes more and more important both for:","1) applications concerning specifically the processing of textual fragments, (studies in linguistic analysis, in information retrieval and question-answering systems, etc.);","2) the implementation of a viable communication process within interactive systems also for problems not specifically linguistic, (such as computer aided instruction, computer aided design, etc.), so that non specialized people can access and use the system without the burden of some more or less rigidly coded command language.","A typical application which combines both of the above aspects can be found in a hospital where the collection and the analysis of clinical data is to be performed automatically. This will be accomplished by a combined hardware-software system capable to process and analyze clinical data expressed in narrative form, e.g. the patients' anamneses; it should furthermore enable the sanitary staff of the hospital to use some form of on-line communication language as explicit as possible.","Any significant processing of information expressed in natural language requires one be able to perform some kind of content analysis on the input data, and to infer some significant associations between these data and particular actions which are considered pertinent in a given context. For instance, in the case of the hospital system mentioned before, the content analysis of patients' anamneses should make it possible to relate the textual data composing an anarmlesis with the clinical aspects considered useful for the possible diagnosis and therapy. 19 290 M. MENNUCCI\" ]~. MORREALE","The content analysis to be performed on a text requires that both syntactic and semantic features of the text be simultaneously analyzed:","- the syntactic features will lead to the recognition of the simple linguistic elements forming the given, more complex, one;","- the semantic features will assodate with the different linguistic elements, composing the text, concepts and actions which are relevant for the particular context in which the text is analyzed; for instance the clinical context in the case of an anamnesis.","In the case of artificial languages, it has become customary to analyze separately these two kinds of features. The much greater complexity of natural languages consists essentially in the fact that such a sharp distinction between these two kinds of features can no longer be made, and therefore, the analysis will require a more unified procedure.","The necessity of a combined syntactic and\" semantic\" analysis arises even at the very preliminary level we are considering in this work, i.e. at the level of the morphological analysis of the words composing a text. More precisely, we shall consider the problem of an automatic morphological analysis of Italian words, and hence the computer-aided construction of an Italian morphological dictionary.","The necessity of a combined analysis, as mentioned before, arises already at this level as a consequence of the fact that the stem of a word carries the bulk of its semantic value, while the various suffixes that can be appended to it must follow specific morphological rules; they are, furthermore, related to the possible syntactic uses of the word in a sentence and determine, at the same time, its precise meaning in the text.","Actually, from such a dictionary, one would obtain for any Italian word ;","-some grammatical qualifications such as substantive, adjective, verb, singular, plural, masculine, feminine, tense, person etc.;","- some semantic qualifications specify!ng which kinds of relations tie together this word with some other words in the dictionary, according to the particular context in which the text is analyzed.","In such a way, after stem-suffix analysis has been made, grammatical qualifications will mainly result from suffix structures which are common to all the words of the language, while semantic qualifications in any given context will depend only on stems. Therefore the semantic relations constituting these qualifications will be built around the set of stems contained in the dictionary.","According to the above remarks, our work has been oriented to-AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFHX DISCRIMINATION 291 ward the study of the flexive structure of Italian words, i.e. the structure according to which, from a single stem, through affixing it with a set of different su~xes, a set of different forms can be derived, each one being qualified by convenient grammatical categories.","The problem of building a morphological dictionary is considered here more from the Information Science point of view than from the linguistic point of view. More precisely, our attention has been mainly focused on the problem of giving some automatic assistance to human operators engaged in the construction of a morphological dictionary, and an interactive system has actually been studied for this purpose. This system has been planned for languages which, like Italian, have a richly flexive structure.","In the present paper, after some short comments about the utility of automatic morphological analysis and the different approaches which can be followed in constructing an Italian morphological dictionary (sec. 2), we give the description of the proposed system (sec. 3) and some concluding remarks (sec. 4). 2. Computer aided construction of a morphological dictionary.","Morphology is that part of linguistics which studies word formation and provides us with rules and explanation about the internal structure of a word. Such information about the internal structure of words can be very useful in the analysis of a text at least in four major areas:","1) It helps us control the widening, enrichening and modification of the concepts used within the universe of discourse which is specific to any application context in which textual analysis is performed. In a system in which no morphological analysis is provided any word is considered merely as a \"sequence of characters \", each one independent from the others; therefore the addition of any new word will be considered merely as the addition of a new entry to a list of words, even if the new word is simply a new derivation of a stem already present in the dictionary through one or more of its forms.","Furthermore the use of morphological analysis allows one to give semantic qualifications to the stems instead of to the forms, facilitating thus both a more compact and uniform treatment of semantics and the recognition of similarity among aggregates as: 292 M.

The situation appears somehow different when the dictionary is to be used in some specific field of application, for instance that of anamneses analysis in a particular medical field. In fact, in this case it is very difficult to reach any a priori decision about:","1) the selection of the specific words to be included in the dictionary;","2) the selection of the non-specific words to be included in the dictionary: AN\" INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFFIX DISCRIMINATION 293","3) the selection of the flexional structures to be considered for the expansion of the above words.","On the other hand, in ahnost all applications of such kinds, one has a quite large and significant sample of text fragments to analyze, which in some way explicitly defines the area in which linguistic analysis should be made.","According to such considerations, the guidelines which seemed to us worth following for the computer-assisted construction of a dictionary, can be condensed as follows:","1) to start from the collection of text fragments which are already available, i.e. from a set of forms, assuming, as we have verified, that in such texts many forms derived from the same stein are present;","2) to apply some automatic mechanism which can put in evidence, as much as possible, the strong regularities which are character-istic of the Italian morphology, so that human decisions can be applied to classes of words, and to exceptions;","3) to try to take into account as many as possible of the regularities and of the exceptions explicitly outlined by a conventional grammar, in order to enhance the efficiency of the above process.","Therefore, according to the explicit indications (examples) given by a conventional grammar, two sets, E and lk, of words will be formed:","- the exlusion list E, which will contain all those words for which no, or very individual behaviour, is indicated;","- the regu/arity list R, which will contain some flexionally complete samples (hereafter to be called \"templates \") for any flexional structure which is representative of a large class of words.","For a specific application to a certain field, for which we have a collection of text-fragments, we shall, first of all, build the set S of all forms contained in it, subtract from S tile elements belonging to E, and add to it the elements of lk; the resulting set will be the input for the system, to be processed as described in the next section."]},{"title":"3.

For this purpose, two basic operations must be performed:","1) extraction of- even incomplete - subtrees related to the same stem; this process will result essentially from the, possibly iterated, extraction of\" minimal subtrees \" to be defined below;","2) widening, as much as possible, of the flexional structures extracted before; this process will benefit from the introduced templates, and will require some amount of interaction with the operator.","In order to describe the functions performed in step 2, let us define a \"minimal subtree\" of a given tree as the tree of all (at least two) branches which emerge from the same node, and which do not give rise to any other proper branching. Let us call \"fight part\" any set of characters constituting a branch in a minimal subtree, and \"right structure\" the set of all right parts in a minimal subtree.","The result of applying step 2 to our example is shown in Fig. 2, where all minimal subtreees have been marked by bold lines. As this example shows, the majority of minimal subtrees so extracted refer to the same stem, and this result has beeen strongly conftrmed by our experience on Italian words. A more detailed analysis of the different situations which can arise during the extraction of minimal subtrees is made through Fig. 5:","-In Fig. 5 a, the extracted minimal subtree represents exactly a flexional structure;","- in Fig. 5 b, the detected minimal subtree gives us a fight structure constituting only a part of a broader flexional structure which will be detected by further iterations;","- in Fig. 5 c, the detected minimal subtree gives us a fight structure which does not represent a flexional structure and should therefore be discarded. 298 M.
