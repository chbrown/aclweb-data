The reason is quite evident: by suppressing the noun (nucleus) in a nominal NG, the last determinans turns into a pronoun, i.e. it represents the nucleus in a pronominal NG.

AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE GERMAN NOUN GROUP 257","There is another difference beween a nominal NG and a pronominal one: in nominal NGs one can find other NGs embedded: die Ansprachen haltenclen Parlamentarier, or (rather complex) die nach Marx alle menschlichen Handlungen wesentlich und zu aller Zeit zum Naehteil der Mehrheit der BevSlkerung bestim-","menden Kapitatgesetze. In both cases the first die belongs to the last word, to Parlamentarier and Kapitalgesetze ; die Parlamentarier and die Kapitalgesetze form the hierarchically highest NG.

This explains the difference between a nominal NG and a pronominal one, too. 4. Criteria for the analysis. The different elements of a German NG tmderlie different kinds of syntagmatic relations. The number of these relations varies corresponding to the two types of NGs. Four kinds of relations are relevant for the nominal NG:","congruity between adjectives and nouns (concerning case, number, and gender)","between determinantia and nouns (concerning case, number, and gender)","between prepositions and nouns (concerning the case of a noun and the possible government of a preposition)","between determinantia and adjectives (concerning case, number, and gender);","inflectional relation between determinantia and adjectives (concerning the inflexion of a determinans and the inflexion of a following adjective;","degree of comparison of the adjective of the nominal NG (providing the connection with further parts of the syntactical analysis);","compatibility of subclasses of determinantia according to the rules R1 to R5; the rule of compatibility of nominal NG has the form: 17 258 GERD LAU - HANS DIETER LUTZ","((det = 1) =~ ((M(WK, I, n-i) = DET1A v (M(WK, I, n-i -t- 1) =","= DET2A ,i DET2B v DET4)) v ,i ((M(WK, I, n-i)=DET2Â(M(WK, I, n-i+ 1)=","=DETa)))v v ((M(WK, I, n-i) = DET1B ̂(M(WK, I, n-i-{- 1) =","=DET2C)))v v ((M(WK, I, n-i)=DET2Ĉ(M(WK, I, n-i+ 1)=","v ((det = 2) ~ (M(WK, I, n-i) = DET1A ̂(M(WK, I, n-i -t- 1) = = DET2A ̂(M(WK, I, n-i + 2) = DET4))). ~8","Only two kinds of relations are relevant for the pronominal NG:","congruity between determinantia and pronouns (concerning case, number, and gender)","between prepositions and pronouns (concerning the case of a pronoun and the possible government of a preposition);","compatibility of subclasses of determinantia according to the rules R6 to R9; the rule of compatibility of a pronominal NG has the form:","((det = 1) =~ ((M(WK, I, n-i) = DET1A) ̂(M(WK, I, n-i + 1) = = DET2A v"]},{"title":"DET2B))).","paragraphs":["Summing up, there are only two kinds of relations of the pronominal NG, but four kinds of relations of the nominal NG; the set of the various congruity relations noticeable at the nominal NG differs from the one noticeable at the pronominal NG; and the compatibility","13 This notation is a conglomerate of matrix-notation, logical signs, and of programmer's conventions.

An algorithm as representation of a hyperrule.","The preceding outlines displayed the complexity of contextual restrictions concerning German noun groups. It sounds extremely clmnsy to talk about these restrictions in a natural language. We therefore developed a formal notation for the communication between linguists and programmers of our team. It consists of a matrix-notation, sentential connectives, functions and flow chart conventions. The compatibility rules were a small cut-out. For more details see our forthcoming publication. TM","In the following, we will discuss the nominal NG only, because its structure and its difficulties are more interesting than the structure of the pronominal NG.","At the present state of our algorithm the following constructions have been excluded: coordination of adjectives, fusion of prepositions and certain determinantia (i.e. am being an + dem), postponed prepositions, prepositions like um ... willen, and embedded participle constructions.","The reason for excluding embedded participle constructions is that, in our opinion, complex constructions like these can be analyzed after the successful interpretation of simple sentences only. The other restrictions mentioned above are not so important, i.e. the solution of these problems are, more or less, not so difficult, and, in fact, one of our collegues has made a proposal for the treatment of all kinds of prepositions.","At the moment, we will consider the following hyperrule and we will interprete it as a statement about the word order only:","(1) (PRAEP) (DET) (DET) (DET) (((ADV*) ADJU*) ADJ)* NOM ~ NG. is","14 Aa~ITSCROPPE MASA, Zur maschinellen Syntaxanalyse L Morphosyntaktische Voraussetzungen flit eine maschindle Sprachanatyse des Deutschen, in, Forschungsberichte des Instituts fLir deutsche Sprache, Mannheim ~), XVIII, 1, XVIII, 2, 1974.","15 The asterisk indicates the possibility of iterating.

After having found a NOM, the whole algorithm will be called up in order to search an ADJ to the left of the NOM. ADV* and ADJU* can appear only in case an ADJ has been found. Otherwise the algorithm turns to DET, which tests the word order and compatibility of the DETs if there exists a DET. There are no more than three DETs admitted. PRAEP is the word class which stands at the extreme left in German NGs (according to our restrictions); it is the last one to be looked for.","In many cases the output of this analysis depends on homography.

If PRAEP is no homograph and if'there is no DET, the whole string must be a NG (see (3)).","As homographs may exist, the algorithm is constructed in the following way: in a first step the longest nominal NG possible is built up, and in a second step this nominal NG is minimized in all possible interpretations (in the case of (2) there are five interpretations which cover shorter nominal NGs than the first one).

Problems concerning the identification of a \"nominal complex\" (consisting of a NG or of a number of NGs).","A nominal complex NK is a noun group or a string of noun groups which are part of a sentence. Yet, this gives no information about the role the NK plays in the sentence: a NK can be either an object which depends on the finite verb, or an \"Angabe \".

Thus the analysis of (13) would have to be an analysis of (14), and vice versa.","It would need too much space to print the set of theoretically possible analyses of (15) here. The reader easily sees, in how many different ways RR1-RR5 can be applied. The whole set of possible analyses is greater than 100! We just show a single analysis. We note the rule being applied in the leftmost column. Now we try to use the \" Satzbauplan\" as a means of improving the exhaustive analysis-procedure. In (15) wartete is the single finite verb. It has the SBP f~ 4 aufq- 1. That means, it takes both an object in the nominative case and a prepositional object. Having found a certain SBP, our algorithm runs as follows:","1. Look for a NG (, , O) and make it an object. (According to RR1, RR5.)","2. Look for a NG ( , , 4) which contains the preposition auf, and make it an object. (According to RR1, RR3.)","3. Apply RR1, RR2 and RR4 to the NGs which are not objects.","4. Try to analyze one of the NGs which are not objects as an attribute of an object.

That means that the unshortenend result of more than 100 analyses can be reduced to 8 by using an improved version of analysis. This shows that the SBP gives us the syntactical information which is necessary to make the correct analysis.","On the opposite page we show that all 8 analyses are possible with the SBP 0 4 auf+ 1 and the structure of NGs as in (15). Sometimes one can find more than one finite verb in a sentence: (16) Er liebe bestimmte nahe","verb1 verb~ verb3","adj~ adj~ adj3","prep1","adju~ Wa'Ider In these cases one has to find out which of the verbs is the actual finite verb. In German the finite verb can appear at the first position in the sentence, at the second position, and at the end. It is easy to fill up the following matrix according to the verbs in (16): verb liebe bestimmte nahe 1 \"t position w 2nq posizion + + + end Neither verb1, verbs or verbs is standing at the first position or at the end of the sentence. From that we can conclude that each of them must be at the second position of the sentence. We still know another criterion to find the right verb: The string in front of it, at position 1, must be an NK. In (16) only verb1 meets this condition. Therefore liebe is the finite verb.","Only if one knows a lot of syntactical heuristics like these, one is able to decide at which level of sentence-analysis semantics should be employed. We think there will be need for an interaction between a syntactical and semantical component."]}]}
