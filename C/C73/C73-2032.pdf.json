Ambiguous word forms (often called \"homonyms \" or - in writ-ten language - \"homographs \") are known as obstacles in many fields","of computational linguistics, especially in automatic documentation, content analysis or mechanical translation. In this respect two problems must be distinguished:","1) the detection of homographic word fonus in the text,","2) their disambiguation by analysis procedures. This paper exclusively deals with the first problem. 1. The Detection Of Homographs.","1.1. In current procedures for the detection of homographs two alternatives can be differentiated:","i) Homographs are identified like monosemic word forms by segmentation and looking up in the standard lexicon. Homographs are detected, if segments of text word forms correspond with more than one lexicon-entry. Lexicon-entries representing homographic items therefore need no special marking.","ii) Homographs are identified by means of a special homograph dictionary, which can be worked out in two versions:","1) the homograph dictionary contains the graphenfic shapes of all homographic word forms (full forms) and their possible linguistic specifications. In this case no segmentation procedures are required.","2) the dictionary does not contain full forms but only the respective canonical forms. A special marking gives information about other corresponding dictionary-entries and the extent of their overlapping. 458 tmNz j. WF~R In both cases (1) and (2) the identification of homographic text word forms is separated from the identification of monosemic ones. Procedures (i) and (ii) have some characteristic advantages and defects, which I will consider rather briefly.","1.2. As already pointed out the first method requires (1) a segmentational algorithm, with the help of which the word forms of a text can be parsed into segments (e.g. stems and inflectional affixes), (2) an identificational component composed of a grapheme-sequence-comparing algorithm and the standard lexicon; thus it can be checked, whether a text segment detected by (1) is the expression-side of one (or perhaps more) lexical unit(s). If this is the case, the content-side(s) of the corresponding unit(s) can be assigned to the text segment.","1.2.1. According to this conception the identification of word forms would offer no problems in the following cases:","i) the word form represents only one sequence of segments (is monosemic), that means that each segment corresponds to one lexicon-entry: Germ.: ...OkindesO... -/kind/+/es/ Kind Engl. : ...OchildsO... -/child/+/s/ child Frnc. : ...OenfantO .,. -/enfant/+/121 / enfant Russ.: ...Oreb~nokO... -/reb~nok/+[O/ reb~nok","ii) The word form can be parsed into more than one set of segments (is homographic), and the possible readings show coinciding segment-boundaries: Germ.: ...OlautO..."]},{"title":"-Ilautl+lol L'̀.t (SUB) Ilautl+lOI laut (ADJ) .ngl.: ...OmeanO... -Imeanl+l l mean (ADJ) Im anl+Ol to me,,.","paragraphs":["... ,,, Frnc. : ...OmortO... -/mort/+/£1/"]},{"title":"mort (SUB)","paragraphs":["Imort/+/o/ mort (ADJ) ,,,",".°,","tkuss.: ...O~ilaO... @il/+/a/ ~ilal /~il/+[a/ ~ilaz THE AUTOMATICALLY BUILT UP HOMOGRAPH DICTIONARY 459","If the detected segments are compared with all graphematically corresponding lexicon-entries, that is, if the lexicon-look-up is not stopped after the first correspondence, this case can also easily be coped with. If the entries are arranged in alphabetical order, the respective units will immediately succeed one another.","1.2.2. The detection becomes difficult however, if one word form is parsed into more than one set of segments (is homographic), while the segment-boundaries in the possible readings are overlapping: Germ. : ...OgetriebenO..."]},{"title":"-Itriebl+/ge-en/ treiben Igetriebel+ln/ Getriebe","paragraphs":["Engl. : ...ohearingfS..."]},{"title":"-]hear/+/ing/ to hear","paragraphs":["-/hearing/+/O/"]},{"title":"hearing Frnc.: ...OpacherO... -Ipachl+/er p cher (VRB) /p~cher/-}-]O/ p~cher (SUB)","paragraphs":["Russ.: ...f3valaxf3... -/val/q-/ax/"]},{"title":"val","paragraphs":["/valax/+/O/"]},{"title":"valax","paragraphs":["As the segments which have thus been detected do not coincide graphematically (e.g./trieb/-/getriebe{), i.e., as the respective lexicon-entries are to be fotmd at different places in the lexicon, for the identification of such homographs enormous parsing - and comparing - procedures are required. As cases of homography with overlapping segment-boundaries in the various readings are encountered quite frequently in languages with extensive inflection (e.g. German, French, Russian), method 1.1. (i) is not the best in any case.","1.2.3. The advantage of this method is above all to be seen in the fact that the identification of homographs can be managed automatically, and that no special marking of the respective entries is necessary. This is especially important with regard to dynamic lexical systems, where the number of lexicon-entries and their specification can vary; new entries do not require a change of the detection procedure. The disadvantage consists in the fact that monosemic and ambiguous word forms are submitted to the same procedure, which amounts to an undue delay of the determination ofmonosemic word forms. Multiple parsing with subsequent lexicon-look-up has always to be applied if the respective text word forms contain grapheme sequences, whidl correspond to inflectional affixes. Only after this can it be found out whether more than one plausible reading has resulted: 460 HEINZ J.

The Automatically Built Up Homograph Dictionary.","paragraphs":["2.1. In this paper a method will be outlined, in which the advantages of the first procedure are combined with those of the second one: the standard lexicon therefore can be extended automatically' without delaying the identificational procedure. The homograph dictionary is compiled by analysis of the standard lexicon; all stems representing homographic items are taken away from it and integrated into the homograph dictionary. The same algorithm, which detects homographies incorporated in the standard lexicon, can be used to find out by analysis of both lexica, whether new entries and all inflected forms represented by them are homographs. If this is the case, they are registered in the homograph dictionary, otherwise in the standard lexicon.

Prerequisites for the outlined algorithm are:","1) a computerized stem-lexicon; the entries, which have to be arranged in alphabetical order, must bear an inflection-class-marking, which makes it possible to generate all inflected forms represented by the respective stems: ,o# /ficht] :fechten, VRB, intl.-class 48 /fichte/ : Fichte, SUB, intl.-class 5 ...","2) A complete list of inflectional affixes, which bear the possible inflection-class-markings corresponding to those of the stems:","/0/ : SUB, intl.-classes ..., 5 ....

The selection of stems and the comparison of the co-occurring inflectional afftxes could be carried out in a slightly modified way. As already pointed out, the selection of stems is in the main determined by the grapheme sequence G, (which specifies the graphematic overlapping of non-homographic stems). Further restrictions concern the correspondence between Gk and the inflectional affixes co-occurring with the selected stems (see 2.3. (iii) and (iv). As the inflection-classmarkings of stems and affixes (which are similar) are shortened distributional classifications, it is obvious to bring them into a system, according to the respective specifications of Gk. A matrix is built up by which it can be seen whether a G~ -specification restricts the coordination of stems with certain inflection-classmarkings. In this way the detailed examination and comparison of all co-occurring affixes (in accordance to condition 2.3. (iv)) can be substituted by one single operation, at least in a good number of cases.

The conceived algorithm selects just two entries (respectively their paradigms), which are examined for homographic word forms. After the first cycle of selecting and comparing -as pointed out in 2.5. - homographs, which are members of more than two paradigms (e.g. 466 UEINZ j. w~R German OalbenO: Album, Alba, Albe, Albx, Alb~), therefore, are not specified exhaustively: Album n Alba ={alben} Album A Albe = {alben} Album fl Alb~ ={alben} Album A Alb~ = {alben} Alba fl Albe ={alben} Alba I\"1 Albx = {alben} Alba n Alb2 ={alben} Albe fl Alb, = {albe, alben} Albe fl Alb~ ={alben} Albl fl Alb~ = {alb, alben}","In this example OalbenO is described as a member of altogether ten intersection sets (which are the results of the first coordination-cycle).
