INTRODUCTION","This paper is concerned with semantic (or lexical) structures of the type used in programs which involve natural language processing, such as question-answering systems. These structures, which generally take the form of graphs representing semantic relations defined on word senses, must satisfy some rather self-evident requirements relating to their linguistic significance and adequacy and to their suita-bility for computational implementation. In addition, if the lexical subsets in question are to be nontrivial in size, the structures must be constructible in some systematic, consistent way, preferably with the aid of a computer. The structures which have been used in existing experim.ental systems, such as those reported in M. R. QUILLIAN (1969) and K. M. SCaWARCZ, J. F. BtraGrR, K. F. SIMMONS (1970), have generally been very restricted, and it has been argued (S. Y. S~D~OW, 1972) that it is their lack of constructibility which has precluded the possibility of extending them.","The aim of this paper is to describe two examples of the use of constructibility as a design criterion for semantic structures. The semantic relations of hyponymy and compatibility are introduced in the following section, and suitable representations for them are developed in sections 3 and 4, respectively. Throughout the discussion, the con-- structibility of a representation is to be interpreted as its amenability to the use of a computational discovery algorithm which would build the structure and have the properties of semi-automatic operation, simple input data, efficiency in the quantity of input, consistency maintenance, and monotonic refinement of the growing structure. The meaning of this terminology will be made more clear in the course of the discussion. 30 FRANK G.

STRUCTURES. FOR HYPONYMY","To illustrate some classes of structures for the hyponymy relation, a hypothetical set of seven word senses a, b .... , g will be used. Their hyponymy relationships are given in Fig. 1 in the form of a matrix: a sense x is a hyponym of a sense y if and only if there is a 1 in the position whose row corresponds to x and whose column corresponds to y. 32 FRANK G.

CotuNs, M. 1~. QUttHAN (1969). T. G. B~.W.R and P. S. R.OSSNRAU~ (1970) have also argued for the adequacy of tree structures in this context.

It is clear that with the present state of our knowledge a linguistic case can be made for both H-graphs and /-/-forests as the appropriate class of structures for the hyponymy relation.","Turning now to the constructibility of the various possible classes of hyponymy structures, it is not necessary to consider F-graphs and G-graphs, since they m:iy be dismissed in favor of H-graphs purely on the grounds of their mathematical properties and economy of representation. Both H-graphs and H-forests are constructible insofar as one can devise semi-automatic discovery procedures which will, in principle, construct them from basic data obtained from an informant. 36 FRANK G. PAGAN This \"basic data \" would consist of judgments of the relationships between particular pairs of senses: either the first is a hyponym of the second, the second is a hyponym of the first, they are synonyms, or they are related in none of these ways.","The H-graph or H-forest would be constructed by a process of monotonic refinement; i.e., after the incorporation of each additional word sense, the new structure would be a recognizable generalization of the previous structure. More specifically, suppose that Hi and Hi+l are the current structures after i and i + 1 senses, respectively, x and y are any two senses previously processed, and the"]},{"title":"distance","paragraphs":["between two senses on the same path is the number of arcs separating them. Then the following statements would hold:","a) If x and y are at the same node in H i, then they are at the same node in Hi+l;","b) x and y are not at the same node in H i iff they are not at the same node in H~+I;","c) x is above y in Hi iff x is above y in Hi+l;","d) if x is a distance d above y in Hi, then x is a distance d or d q-1 above y in Hi+l.","e) if x is a distance d above y in Hi+l, then x is a distance d or d-1 above y in Hi;","f) x and y are not on the same path in Hi iff they are not on the same path in Hi+l.","The remaining requirements for constructibility are those of input efficiency and consistency maintenance. An obvious point of reference for efficiency is the maximum number of inputs which would be required irrespective of the algorithm and the set of word senses used.","1 N 2, where N is the number of senses, This is approximately given by and would be reached in cases where inputs must be obtained for all pairs of senses. The transitivity of hyponymy would allow H-graphs to be constructed with better efficiency than this; for example, if a sense z were found to be a hyponym of y, and y were known to be a hyponym of x, then it could be inferred or"]},{"title":"predicted","paragraphs":["that z is a hyponym of x with no additional input. H-forests could be constructed with better efficiency than H-graphs since they are a much more predictive class of structures; for example, if z were found to be \" unrelated\" at the root of a tree, then it would be predicted to be \"unrelated\" everywhere in the tree.","Because the H-graphs are a fully general class of structures, inconsistency of a set of inputs with respect to them could be due only to CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS FOR TWO SEMANTIC RELATIONS - 37 a violation of transitivity, and the procedure could check for such occurences automatically. In the case of H-forests, there is more scope for inconsistency, since any valid H-graph which is not also an H-forest represents a set of information which is inconsistent with H-forests. The procedure would have to obtain redundant inputs in order to maintain a consistency check in this case. The details of testing for and correcting inconsistencies would depend upon the properties of the particular discovery procedure used.","To summarize this section, I have attempted to place in perspective the plausible classes of structures for hyponymy. Both H-graphs and H-forests satisfy the basic requirement for constructibility. The construction of the latter, however, would be more efficient, so that it would be disadvantageous to use a discovery procedure for H-graphs in general if H-forests alone are linguistically adequate. 4. STRUCTURES FOR COMPATIBILITY","The variety of structure classes for the compatibility relation turns out to be richer than in the case of hyponymy. To illustrate some of these representations, suppose that the compatibility relationships among the seven-word senses a, b ..... g are as shown in the matrix of Fig. 7. a b c d e f g 1 (symmetric) 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 Fig. 7.

One particularly interesting transformation of the matrix or A-graph is obtained by grouping senses with the same compatibility properties with respect to all the other senses and placing them at the same node. The interpretation of such a"]},{"title":"C-graph","paragraphs":["is that two senses are compatible if and only if they are associated with the same or adjacent nodes.

Neither are they necessarily unique: it can be shown that some C-graphs have more than one equivalent D-graph.","• ' ~\"","d b e,f g Fig. 10.

The constructibility criterion also bears strongly on the relative merits of these structure classes. Considering the C-graphs first, it 40 FRANK G. PAGAN may easily be shown that this class satisfies all the requirements of constructibility except the crucial one of effciency. Assuming the availa-bility of basic data in the form of yes-or-no judgments of the compatibility of unordered pairs of word senses, a C-graph could be built by a monotonic refinement process: at each stage the current sense would either be added to an existing node or form a new node, possibly in conjunction with the \"splitting \" of other nodes. Efficiency, however, is the worst possible because the class of structures is fully general, and the judgements obtained for the compatibility of the current sense with some subset of the previous senses have no predictive value for its compatibility with any of the other senses in the graph.","The lack of effciency in constructing C-graphs can be regarded as a corollary of the fact that inconsistencies are impossible2 They are possible in the case of D-graphs, however, and thus the assumption that they would not arise would make some judgments unnecessary after others became known. But D-graphs fail to be constructible because of their non-uniqueness. The D-graphs shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 are equivalent, 8. c g f e Fig. 11.

CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS FOR TWO SEMANTIC RELATIONS 41 & e cl e Fig. 12. An equivalent D.-£raphl a :r e; Fig. 13. A rcfineraent of Fig. 1L 42 FRANK G. PAGAN The latter graph is a simple modification of Fig. 11 but not of Fig. 12, and there is no graph equivalent to Fig. 13 which is easily obtained from Fig. 12. Since a given discovery procedure could construct either of the first two graphs depending upon the order in which the senses were incorporated, the process would in general involve complete reconstruction rather than monotonic refinement.","The D-forests, finally, are constructible in all respects. Monotonic refinement is characterized in this case by the following statements, where x and y again are any two senses previously processed and D~ and D~+ 1 are the current forests after i and i q- 1 senses, respectively:","a) if x and y are at the same node in D,., then they are at the","same or adjacent nodes in Di+l;","b) if x is a distance d above y in Di, then x is a distance d or","d -q- 1 above y in D~+I;","c) if x is a distance d above y in Di+l, then x is a distance d or","d-- 1 above y in D~;","d) x and y are not on the same path in Di iff they are not on","the same path in Di+l.","A D-forest is a highly predictive structure; i.e., a judgment involving one of its word senses will in general predict the outcome of many other judgments. A detailed estimation of the efficiency of construction would involve the order of the senses, the configuration of the final structure, and the node-scanning strategy used in the discovery algorithm. It is sufficient here to recall, however, that nodes correspond to linguistic features, and hence one would expect that if the number of senses processed were very large, then the number of nodes would be much smaller. Thus all the nodes would appear relatively early in the construction process, and this leads to the conclusion that the total number of judgments would be a nearly linear function of the number of senses. In order to detect inconsistencies, however, some of this efficiency would have to be sacrificed and redundant judgments taken.","To sum up this section, the series of structure classes considered for representing compatibility has led to one class, the D-forests, which is constructible. These structures also have several important properties in common with other models in theoretical and computational linguistics. CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS FOR TWO SEMANTIC RELATIONS 43 5. CONCLUSION","This paper has presented two examples of the use of constructibility as a design criterion for lexical or semantic structures of the type used in natural language processing. This criterion is essential if we ever hope to implement computational systems with broad linguistic competence. It is very encouraging that in the two cases considered the approach has led to structures basically equivalent to those which have actually been used. Although these previous models have generally lacked the property of constructibility, then, it is suggested that this is a fault of design which can be overcome. REFERENCES","T. G. BEvy, P. S.
