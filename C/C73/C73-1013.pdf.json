Unlike psychologists, linguists have been rather slow to adopt computers for the development and evaluation of mathematical models of verbal behaviour. The present paper attempts to contribute to the development of such models by demonstrating the use of some computational approaches for differential representation of verbal perceptual structures.","Speech perception may in a broad sense be defined as that part of the communication process taking place within the receiver. We should try to reach a more detailed view of the speech perception mechanism, that is to suggest some \"white box\" instead of the \"black box\"","The common methodological premise for a model which accounts for various aspects of the speech perception problem is a representation of any speech unit (a sound, a syllable, a word etc.) as a point in a multidimensional perceptual space with the perceived difference between 172 R. M. FRUMKINA- P. F. ANDRUKOVlCH- A. YU. TEREKHINA such stimuli represented by the distance between the stimulus points.","To develop a model for this psychological space we have: 1) to determine the dimensionality of the space; 2) to describe the position of the speech stimuli in question along the dimensions obtained; 3) to determine the position of the Ss perceiving the given set of speech stimuli with respect to these dimensions; 4) to suggest some linguistic and/or psychological interpretation of the discriminative dimensions and of groupings (if any) of individuals having different \" viewpoints\" about stimulus interrelations.","From the manner fia which Ss make perceptual similarity judgements about verbal stimuli it is possible to infer the dimensions of the given set of stimuli which account for the responses obtained.","Methods of multidimensional scaling provide us with highly sophisticated tools for making this inference. The problem of multidimensional scaling broadly stated is to find n points whose interpoint distances match in some sense the experimental similarities of n objects (instead of similarities the experimental measurements may be dissimilarities, confusion probabilities or other measures). Hence, we view muhidi' mensional scaling as a problem of statistical fitting - the similarities are given, and we wish to find the point configuration whose distances fit them best.","The well-known method of principal components can be used to fred out the most discriminative response dimensions (W. S. TORG~R-SON, 1952). Given data which represent nonmetric information concerning perceived similarity of stimuli, this method aims at constructing a configuration of those stimuli in a best-fitting Euclidean subspace. The dimensions obtained are oriented along the latent vectors corresponding to the most valued latent roots of similarity matrix. Method of principal components gives a linear orthogonal projection in a best fitting subspace.","There exists, however, another class of methods which provide for the mapping of raw data by some kind of non-linear transformation. For the analysis of perceptual structures in verbal behaviour the present authors have used a modification of the \"individual multidimensional scaling\" methods suggested by B. BLOXOM (1968), C. Hoa_~N (1969) and J. D. CAaROL and J. j. CrlANG (1970). This approach to the analysis of experimental data permits us to describe the individual differences between Ss in stimuli perception. In our previous research we have applied some methods of multidimensional scaling for studying the subjective probability estimates of Russian words. In the present COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF VERBAL BEHAVIOUR 173 paper for purposes of illustration we perform an analysis of similarity judgements among block letters of the Russian alphabet according to the above mentioned model.","Measures of perceived similarity among stimuli may be obtained by several experimental procedures. Tiffs study uses the data of the experiment, in which the stimuli - 32 block letters of Russian alphabet - were presented pair-wise (E. N. GrR~ANOV, P. F. ANDRUKOV'tCH, A. P. VASlrEWCH, 1972; the same procedure was used by T. K/2NNAVAS, 1966). Ss have been asked to judge each pair of letters as \"alike \" or \"not alike \". Each comparison was made by at least 50 Ss, the \"point of view\" of each S being represented by similarity matrix with 0 for \"alike\" and 1 for \"not alike\" as entries. !","JlI 11I o o o \"ib o P o E o ! q T o - o a H o II , B","3 • 0 o O O c 8 o o f[ o IO o","i | hK o H o | H o","x o YA","o o M o If!

We have excluded from further analysis the first latent vector because it has more or less constant elements and may be regarded as allowing for the mean value of distance between all the elements of pairs (J.

According to this approach individuals are assumed differentially to weight the several dimensions of the \"common psychological space\"","Let us take an assumption about the existence of a \" true\" point configuration in k-dimensional Euclidean space, where a set of k dimensions or \"factors\" are common to all individuals, but the weights they assign to these factors are different.

One of the present authors has suggested the following criterion:","Sh Di s ' ' (D,,-d,;) ~ • D,;, for d,, < D,;.","This criterion applied, the distortion of the small distances makes them smaller, and the distortion of the greater ones makes them greater, thus permitting better discrimination between groups of objects. 176 R.

For instance, subject N. 5, who attached very low weight to both dimensions, gave 117 answers \"alike\" and 36 answers \" not alike \". A good contrast to the subject N. 5 is provided by the subjects N. 10 and N. 15, who answered \"alike \" only 3 times from 153 comparison judgements.","However, the most important outcome of our analysis is the fact that the same dimensions being present they have"]},{"title":"different relative importance for different Ss.","paragraphs":["One group of Ss attaches maximal weights to the 1-st dimension (in Fig. 4 the corresponding points are under the diagonal), while another group attaches maximal weights to the 2-nd dimension.
