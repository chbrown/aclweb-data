In this model a semantic map which is called a topological information space, is generated by the grammar,and the space can express implications and similarities among concepts. In the syntax, a syntactic generative grammar is defined based on the space grammar, and a mapping from the map to the language is defined. The mapping is composed of two mappings: one is a meaning affix mapping ~ which maps a conceptual area in the space to a token in the language,and the other is an operator mapping ~ which maps a generative rule in semantics to a rewriting rule in syntax. By these mappings, a derivation tree in semantics is mapped to a derivation tree in syntax, and vice versa.","An algebraic system on the space is defined, and an algebraic system on the sentences is derived by the (~,~)-mappings. English will be analyzed according to this model and the algebraic systems on them.","Finally an information processing model is described based on the model. The information processing in a natural language is carried out in the following steps: recognizing the inputs, parsing, interpreting, deducing, updating them, and outputting. These processes are discussed in details.","I.

OUTLINE OF","THE LINGUISTIC ACTIVITY MODEL","There are two ways in describing meanings: one is connotational semantics; in this case meanings of sentences in a language A are described by sentences in a language B, for example, English is translated into Japanese. The other is the operational semantics; in programming language, input data are computed and the results are output. So the meanings of a programming language is expressed as an operator that prescribe input-output relation.","In our model these two semantics are considered as follows. As for the connotational semantics, we take the topological information space as the language that describes meanings.","In this model we express the meanings of a natural language in the following way: we locate the concepts in the semantic map, i.e. the topological information space as follows; if a concept A implies a concept B, we assign them as the area B contains the area A, and if a similarity (or distance) between a concept A and B is greater than a similarity (or distance) between a concept A and 93 C, we locate the area B nearer ( or farther ) the area A than C.","As for the operational semantics, there are two kinds of operators. One is responces or reactions against the received message, the other is updatings or rearrangements of the memory. The for-mer is carried out by responding with a speech, writing, or actions. The latter is carried out by updating the database.","The model has four description levels: (i)"]},{"title":"Expression level (","paragraphs":["utterances, writings, and actions )","(2)"]},{"title":"Surface level","paragraphs":["( sentences ) (3)"]},{"title":"Deep level (","paragraphs":["phrase-markers ) (4)"]},{"title":"Semantic level (","paragraphs":["information space ).","In the expression level, one's intention is expressed through one's organs.","The surface level is the level of the language which we use in the daily life, and the set of sentences compose elements in this level.","In the deep level, each element is a generator of a surface description, and is in the form of P-marker, i.e. so called a derivation tree.","In the semantic level, the concept is expressed as an area or a file of areas in the information space, where the information space is something like a semantic map, and is made up of the neighbourhood system or the metric space, and has topological properties, which can express distances, similarities and inclusions so on.","In the functional point of view, the information space is composed of a"]},{"title":"meaning subspace","paragraphs":["and an"]},{"title":"estimating subspace,","paragraphs":["where the"]},{"title":"meaning subspace","paragraphs":["expresses topological relations among concepts, the"]},{"title":"estimating subspace","paragraphs":["expresses various estimated yalues in the process of management.

These informations are used in deduction and induction of theorems from axioms, and in management of subjunctive mode. E6] Evaluation of the received contents","After the grammatical valuation of input sentences and semantic interpretation in the space, following managements are carried out: evaluation of communicated contents, and judgement of logical validity. These managements are executed by inferences using deductions, induc-tions and arithmetic operations on areas in the space. By these.processing, confirming the validity on the communicated contents, and drawing new conclusions from inputs and knowledge, are executed. (I) Arithmetic operations","Arithmetic operations are used in deduction, induction and other managem~nts. There are following property-types: D: a power set of areas, H: a power set of hyperplanes, V: a power set of values P E: a power set of estimating value. And following kinds of operations exist.","D × H ×V × *D × H × V × E (2) Evaluation of Declaration","The input informations are checked whether they contradict with the data that are already input and confirmed, (3) Deduction and Induction --99--","(i) Deduction","The question is rewritted to the ques-tions on the space. Using the algebraic properties, the equation is transformed and solved. In case that the algorithm is cataloged, a suitable procedure is searched and triggered. Also suitable procedures are triggered if the estimating value exceeds the threshold in each process.","In case that the algorithm is not cataloged, or the input is not a question, deductions from the input is executed. We communicate each other with some view, and the received information is interpreted in that view, i.e. if the received data contradicts with the same view data, the input data must be checked whether it is right or not. And if a contradiction is not deduced, the valuable data deduced from the input are arranged and stored. In these processes, the deduction is executed by syllogisms or resolution.","(2) Induction","The induction is executed as follows: at first some special predicates in the same view are selected, common variables are searched, universal special predicates are reconstructured by choosing the domain appropreately from the exis-tential special predicates. These exis-tential predicates are not always valid, but if the contradiction is not found by checking the domain in the information space feeding back the result, the Predicates ~re regarded to be correct probably, and are stored as a hypothesis, and output. Where induction is executed on the data which have the same view, and the predicates are selected from the predicates which have the same properties in the same view data.","This operation is useful in creative thinking, for example, from the data gathered, common properties are extracted, and the induction is executed to the predicates which contain the common properties. As a result, from the experimental data or the observational field data, some valuable hypotheses are generated. (4) Updating the Memory or Database","The received message are parsed and mapped to the semantic level, interpreted and deduced. As a result new facts or new informations are clarified. These data are stored in the database. There are two ways of updatings: one is a permanent amendment: if the data is a principle one, modifications of the information space are needed, so the information space generative grammar is reconstructed, and the corresponding amendments of files are carried out. The other is a temporary modification in an interim file. C7] Composition of Intention & Utterance","If the question is ambiguous or the answer is not deducible from the database and inputs, the action-driving potential to fill up the information insufficiency is elevated, then the question to resolve the ambiguities is composed and utterd. If the question is correct and the answer is deducible from the dictionary and inputs, the answer file in the semantic level is translated into the P-marker, and is utterd. If the input is not an interrogation, then the database is up-dated, and no answer or agreeable responces are made, In every case, the intention is described in file form in the semantic level, i.e. tuples of conceptual areas with cases. The file is recomposed to the derivation tree in the syntactic level by 0 and $, transformed to the surface description, and uttered.","6. CONCLUSION","A generative semantics model based on the topological space generative grammar was proposed. This model has more descriptive power than other models because both implications and similarities can be generated in the basic level. The aim of this model is to describe and manage the semantics algebraically, and for that purpose English was arranged based on the model.","The question-answering process in a natural language was clarified. In this model not only a concept but also esti-mation of the information is considered. Then the motivation for next actions can be interpreted. Based on the model, we are now implementing a research-DBMS. Using it we can built up and test hypotheses by KJ-methods and so on.","REFERENCES","i.
