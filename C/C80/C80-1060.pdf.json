The paper illustrates that this can be done in a straightforward way and outlines further improvements of the resulting attribute grammar. Introduction An important component of the natural language information system PLIDIS, developped by my colleagues and myself at the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache in Mannheim (cf. [BW 78], [KL 79]), is the translation algorithm, which transduces natural language sentences into expressions of an augmented first order predicate calculus, called KS (cf. [DZ 78],[Zi 77]). Special features of KS going beyond ordinary predicate calculus are many-sorted domain of objects, l-abstraction, and complex term-building facilities. The examples contained in this paper will illustrate these features. Input for the translation algorithm are the parsed sentence and a set of translation rules (in the following: TR-rules) (cf. [Wu 79]), which are defined for labels of the parse tree nodes, mainly for the labels of the terminal nodes, i. e. for the words of the input sentence. Working bottom up the parse tree the translation algorithm assigns a translation to each of the nodes of the tree by interpreting the TR-rules defined for the labels of the nodes. If a translation has been successfully assigned to the root of the tree, which is labelled by S, this translation is the translation of the whole sentence. The advantage of the translation algorithm, the most important part of which is the interpretation of the TR-rules, is its rather simple structure, which facilitated implementation. But it also has several disadvantages. First of all the algorithm is not very efficient since it runs separately from parsing, i. e. it does not start before parsing has finished. The TR-rules must take care of the structure of the parse tree, that means, during their interpretation we must check which steps were made in parsing some relevant part of the tree. Next, the TR-rule for the label of a node must be completely evaluated, though it depends on the position of the node in the tree, which parts of the rule apply to the node or whether the rule applies as a whole. Finally it is difficult to detect circularities in the translation process on the basis of the TR-rules. To avoid these disadvantages we can use attribute grammars for the translation. The content of the TR-rules must then be represented by attributes and semantic functions. But for this purpose we need a context free grammar as a basis of the parsing. In PLIDIS, however, we have no such grammar, parsing is done by means of an ATN-grammar (cf. [Wo 70] , [Wo 73], [Ba 78], [EL 79]), adapted for German. Though the networks of the ATN-grammar are not context free productions, we can produce such productions out of them. At first glance, by doing so, the context-sensitivity of the networks - which is their main advantage - is lost. But we can regain it by providing the productions with appropriate attributes and semantic functions. If we take a simpler version of the ATN-grammar, namely the RTN-grammar (\"recursive transition networks\") (cf. [Wo 70]), then an ATN-grammar is nothing else but an attributed RTN-grammar; so we could read the letters \"ATN\" as \"attributed transition networks\" instead of \"augmented transition networks\". In the remainder of the paper we omit the attributes needed to express context conditions, we only deal with those needed for translation. To summarize, we have to show how to obtain context free productions from the networks and attributes and semantic functions from the TR-rules. We will demonstrate by examples that the method is straightforward, and we will outline how the resulting attribute grammar can be im-proved. ATN-grammars and TR-rules We want to parse the following questions asking for facts of the PLIDIS mini-world, i.e. the control of water pollution: Enthielt eine Probe im Jahr 1979 in Stuttgart Arsen?

Conclusion We have illustrated how an attribute grammar can be produced from the networks and TR-rules used within PLIDIS, which has the same expressive power as the underlying networks and rules. The advantages of the ATN-grammars for the parsing of natural language sentences are well known. Above all they are an elegant tool to write grammars especially suited for linguists. TheeTR -rules have advantages similar to these. Surely they are easier to write than the somewhat cumbersome expressions for determining attribute values, particularly those for the ÷val-attribute. In the TR-rules, however, attempt is made to describe and deal with all possible occurrences of a symbol. With the attributed productions tbis is not necessary, since for a single production some of the cases which stem from the possible occurrences of one or more symbols can be omitted a priori. For example, in the production PNG + PRAEP NPR the whole first part for determining +vai(PNG) can be omitted, because the first condition does not hold for this production. In a similar way we can omit some part in the production N ÷ Betrieb. Further improvements can be made by changing the productions themselves, e. g. by partly eliminating those symbols which denote word classes. Performing all possible improvements certainly leads to an attribute grammar which yields translations of sentences in a rather efficient way. On the basis of this grammar we can detect circularities which can occur in the translation process by means of well defined algorithms (cf. [Bo 76]).
