In Japanese writing we use many kinds of writing systems, i.e. KanOi, kana, the alphabet, numerals, and so on. We have thought of this as a demerit in language data processing. But we can change this from a demerit to a merit. That is, we can make good use of these many writing systems in our program. Our program has only a small table containing 300 units. And it is very fast. In our experiments we have obtained approximately 90% correct answers. Introduction Obtaining clean date is very important in language data processing. There are two problems here. One is how to input the Japanese text and the other is how to find errors in the data and correct them. The human being is suited to complicated work but not to simple work. The machine, on the contrary, is suited to simple work but not to complicated work. In the word count system using computers, the machine has simple work (sorting, computation, making a list), and the humans have complicated work (segmentation, transliteration from Kan~i to kana, classification of parts of speech, finding errors in the data, discrimination of homonyms and homographs, ets.). However, in this system there is one major problem -- humans often make mistakes. And, regrettably, we cannot predict where they will make them. Thus we decided to make an automatic processing system. This system has to be compact, fast, and over 90% accurate. In Japanese writing we generally use many kinds of writing systems. For example, In this example sentence we find used the alphabet (C, O, L, I, N, G), numerals (8, 0), kana (hirasana --the Japanese cursive syllabary -- ~, O,~, ~,~, ~, and katakana -- the Japanese straight-lined syllabary --~ , ~, ~ , -, ,~,- , j~ ), Kanji ( ~.~,~,~i, ~,~i~ ), and signs (.). And as you can see, there are no spaces left between words. This makes Japanese data processing difficult. Our program makes good use of these different elements in the writing system. At present the automatic processing program makes more mistakes than humans do. But we can predict where it will make them and easily correct errors in the data. Objective","Our objective is a system having the","following functions: i. segmentation 2. tranliteration from Kanji to kana 3. classification of parts of speech 4. adding lexical information by use","of a dictionary 5. making a concordance 6. making a word list","Numbers i, 2, and 3 are especially im-","portant for our program. Our report will","mainly deal with these three functions. The input data is generally a text written in Japanese. The output is a concordance sorted in the Japanese alphabetical order, giving information of the parts of speech, and marked with a thesaurus number. -338-System Figure i is a flow chart of our program. Input is by magnetic tape, paper tape, or card. The input code is the NLRI (National Language Research Institute) code or some other code. Of course we have a code conversion program from other codes to the NLRI code. The second block of Figure 1 shows what we call the automatic processing of natural language. In the supervisor square we check and select the results of the three automatic processing programs. Some of these programs have many kinds of processing of natural language For example, the automatic segmentation program involves the classification of parts of speech, automatic syntactic analysis, automatic transliteration from Kan~i to kana, and so on. (An example will be found in the next section.) In the adding lexical information block of Figure i, we make use of the dictionary obtained by research into some 5 million words at the NLRI. This dictionary includes word frequencies, parts of speech, classes by word origin, and a thesaurus number. By using the concordance we can find and correct errors in the data. As our program is unfortunately not always complete, this concordance is very useful. In the output block of Figure i we can choose a variety of output devices -- an alphabet line printer, a kana line printer, a high-speed Kan~i printe~, or a Kan~i display. Method i. Automatic transliteration from Kanji to Roman letters The Chinese characters have many different readings in Japanese. For example, / sei/ /syo/ /um-/ /iki/ nama/ /ai/ / tachi/ /tatsu/ /tate/ /dachi/ /ritsu/ /rittoru/","-- / ichi/ /itsu/ /kazu/ hajime//hito/ We have to arrange the Japanese words in the Japanese alphabetical order. The program puts the reading way to each word for the word list. The method of selecting the reading is to choose it in accordance with the surroundings of the Kanji in the text. The possible readings for each Kanji are listed in a small table. The records in this table are of 3types- Groupsl,2, and 3 represented by numbers i;2,3~ and 4,5, 6 respectively in Figure 2. The Kanji in Group i have one reading each. The program replaces the KanOi with this reading. In Figure 2, No. I falls into this category. We have about 700 K anji in Group i (~,~ ,~,~ ,~, ets.). The Kanji in Group 2 have tow or more readings each. In Figure 2, Nos. 2 and 3 fall into this category. The format for these entries is group number, the Kanji, the operation code (a numeral or Capital letter), and the reading (up to 8 small letters). The appropriate reading is chosen for the situation of the Kanij in accordance with Table i.","situaton operation letter front behind A I g 2 C 3 D 4 E 5 F 6 G 7 H 8 unti unti 0 i 0 I 0 1 0 i 0 1 0 1 0 i 0 i unti Kanjl i 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 Kanji unti i 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 i 0 1 Kanji Kanji i 0 1 0 1 0 i 0 0 1 0 i 0 1 0 1","O: replace KanJi to reading in the table","Table i.

Table for segmentation and Classification of parts of speech Hiragana-Hiragana type is use of the second most frequent combinations in Japanese. According to Table 2, We are unable to segment for this combination. 'Therefore we make the following rule. The hiragana/~/is used only as a particle and we always segment at it. The other hirasana characters are segmented according to the character string table found in Figure 5. The format, as in the second line in Figure 5, is the number of characters in the string (4), the character string (up to i0 characters) (C ~ L ~), the length of the words ( 2 , I , i ), the parts of speech (C, E, P), and the conjugation (9). This table contains only 300 records. These are the particles, auxiliary verb~ adverbs, and character strings which cannot be segmented by Tabie 3 (ex. CJb~ in Figure 5). This table is applied as follows. The program first searches the character strings of the table in the input sentences. If a character string (~gb~) fits part of an input sentence ( E~b~ l:I~ ), then the program segments it into parts by the lengths of words in the table and adds the information about the parts of speech and conjugation. As a result we obtain the words (~/ b / ~ /). Figure 6 shows the results of automatic segmentation and automatic transliteration from Kanji to Roman letters. The operation of Table 3 has resulted in no segmentation for the strings (/COLING80 /) , (/~/) , (/~rff-~y~--$--J~/), and (/~{!~","/) as well as the segmentation at the sign (/./) .

The program corrects these.","2. There are not many words composed of one character in Japanese except for particles and auxiliary verbs. Figure 9 gives the frequency of some characters and the frequency of words consisting of that character alone. Words of high frequency that are not particles or auxiliary verbs are produced by errors in segmentation. The program then corrects these errors, combining them into longer words.","3. If a verb in the renyo form is followed by another verb, then it is a compound word and the program corrects the error to produce a longer word. Figure i0 shows the results of the supervisor program. In test sentence i, the program at first segmented / ~ /L~/ ~ / ~ / as auxiliary verbs through the use of the table in Figure 5. But the supervisor program checks and corrects this string and the classification program adds th~ information of verb to/~t~'~/, as can be seen in Figure i0. In test sentence 2, the program at first segmented it /#ASOBI/SUGI/TA /, but the supervisor program checked this and corrected this string to the compound word, /#ASOBISUGI/,plus /TA/. We can process Japanese sentences using these methods and obtain words and various information about these words. With this program we can obtain a rate of correct answers of approximately 90 percent.Y3 We should be able to improve this program at the level of the supervisor and the tables. However, we don't think that it will be possible to obtain i00 percent correct answers because this system uses Japanese writing and the Japanese writing system is not i00 percent standardized. In addition, if we wish to produce a complete program, it is necessary to process on the basis of syntax and meaning. At persent, this is not the object of our efforts. 5. Adding lexical information The National Language Research Institute has been investigating the vocabulary of modern Japanese since 1952, and has been using the computer in this research since 1966. As a result, some five million words are available as machine readable data. This data contains vari\" ous information such as word frequency, part of speech, class by word origin, and thesaurus number. The thesaurus, Bunrui go ih~o in Japanese, was produced by Doctor Oki Hayashi. It contains about 38,000 words in the natural language of Japanese. 6. Making the concordance We will not explain this program here since we have written a separate report about it (number 6 in the list of references below). Please refer to this report for further details. Figure ii is the result of this process. Acknowledgements Professor Akio Tanaka developed this plan, made a prototype for automatic transliteration from Kan~i to kana, and permitted us to use this program. Mr. Kiyoshi Egawa made a prototype for an automatic segmentation program and permitted us to use it. They also contributed to this study through our 344 discussions with them. Mr. Oki Hayashi furnished us with the opportunity to study this and provided his support for our efforts. References","Hiroshi Nakano. 1978. An Automatic Processing Sysem of Natural Language.
