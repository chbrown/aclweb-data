The foregoing shows that these operations are mostly auxiliary in nature, their main purpose being to improve the content adequacy and the linguistic acceptability of the translation text formed through the use of the R-level representation; in a concrete automatic translation system based essentially on ~he formal model we have outlined, they may be reduced or even altogether omitted for various practical reasons.","However, whether these supplementary operations be included in an AT system or not, it is clear that the system will depend largely for its efficiency on the choice of the intermediate level R. It is precisely this basic level that we are now Going to consider. General Requirements","From the point of view of the purposes and peculiarities of the translation process, there are two opposite requirements that can be placed upon the intermediate formalized representation R in an automatic translation system.","On the one hand, insofar as translation boils down to transforming the surface structure of a text while preserv-ing its content, it seems safe to assume that if some ,components of the text to be translated~ some features of these components, or links between them are relevant for the content structure of this text, they may also prove of importance for choosing the correct translation equivalents for the text units. Consequently, the adequate representation R used in au AT system should be sufficiently \"semantic\" for all the necessary info~11a-tion concerning the components, links and features in question to be either explicitly given in this representation Or, at least, to be easily obtainable from it. To put it differently, representation R of a text processed must reflect its semantic structure with sufficient precision and in sufficient detail.","On the other hand, the structures of the source and the target l~ages will, as often as not, have certain features in co,non, this leading to an inevitable neutralization of any analysis transformations involving such features, by the inverse transfo~nations during the synthesis process. Such transfo~nations will thus prove unnecessary for translation purposes, no matter how in~ortant they might be as regards the full semantic analysis of the text. Accordingly, representation R must be sufficiently \"superficial\" for its construction to in-corporate the minimum possible of such superfluous transformations.","As we see, the second requirement provides a kind of limitation on the first one, restricting the extent and the methods of the explication necessitated by tile latterp of the semantic structure of the text. Taking into account both of these requirements will most likely result in a kind of a compromise solution suggesting that information made explicit in representation R of a certain text should not include all the elements of its semantic structure; rather, it should cover only those of them which are apriori known to be extensively used in establishing inter-l~guage correlations during translation.","With such a solution, however, one must be fully aware that real texts will contain a substantial proprtion of cases where some text information overlooked by our analysis might eventually turn out relevant for translation. If we do not want to give up the idea of adequately processing such texts as impracticable in principle, it seems useful to impose a third requirement on representation R - the requirement of \"exhaustiveness\" which may be formulated as follows. All information contained in a natural language text and not made explicit in its intermediate representation must be preserved within this representation; if possible, it should be preserved fully and without changing its original (natural language) form, so that there might be no accidental losses or distortions.","If so, the substitution of the formalized representation R for the original text will not exclude the possibility of 175 additional analysis ~llplifying the results of tile standard analyzing procedure and providing access to some extra information that may be required. This is to say that the linguist describing the means of translating concrete language units within such a system will not be subject to the pressure of too stringent limitations originating from the conven-tions of the system, rather than from the nature of the material he deals with, and complicating his task (difficult enough as it is). ~leoretically, he will be free to use any text information (bo~ \"superficial\" and \"deep\")in any way he may find linguistically appropriate: whether as source units to be replaced by tr~islation equivalents, or as condi-tions determining the equivalents chosen for some other units, or else as translation equivalents themselves.","The above principles are general enough to allow of various ways of implementing them in a concrete automatic translation project. We sl~all present here one attempt of such implementation made in defining the so-called Combined Structural Representation to be used in the system of Japanese-Russian automatic translation, now under development at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR"]},{"title":"(~oscow)3.","paragraphs":["Combine d St, ruc, tural Representation (CSR),","Taking into account the typological correlation between the Japanese and the Russlan lan6~ages, we consider it necessary to specify in the CSR of the initial Japanese texts, as well as of their Russiax, translations, five main aspects of text structure: the lexico-granmlati-cal composition of the text processed, its predicate-ar~iment organization on the semantico-syntactic level, the syntactic grouping of its units, the ~apho-tic relations between them, and the peculiarities of their linear arrangement. Within the CSR the corresponding five types of linguistic information about the text form separate components ~lich will now be discussed in turn, mostly from the point of view of their consistency witll the general requirements stated above. Lexico-~|r~lati.cal composition","~e component of the CSR concerned with the lexico-granm~atical composition of the text is intended to contain explicit descriptions of all lexemes present or implied (if ellipsis is the case) in the text under consideration, as well as of all grammatical (morpho-syntaetical) elements accompanying them in the corresponding word forms or quasi-word forms (units taken to be functionally analogous to word forms). The descriptions required must include, apart from the s~nbols of the units involved, information about their meanings within the text in question and about their relevancy or irrelevancy as regards the process of its translation.","~le operations necessary to obtain this component of the CSR ~len analyzing the initial Japanese text will evidently comprise isolating separate word forms and determining their internal structure (in terms of lexemes and morphologic markers), resolving ~nbi~ities for all units established; eliminating synonymy where it is manifested as supplementary distribution or free variation of morphologic units; detecting phraseological word combinations ~d reducing them to a one-word symbol; giving special labels to those word forms or parts of word forms which play ~ auxiliary role in the text analyzed and require no special translation equivalents; filling in the units omitted in the source text if their absence obscures its structure and hinders the translation process (due to the differences between the rules of linguistic ellipsis in the two lmlguages), etc.","From this it follows that the lexicogranm~atical composition of a text cannot be definitively established in the course of its analysis without drawing upon information about its structural characteristics. The same kind of information is also needed ~en working with this component of the CSR in the synthesis process (chiefly in connection with such means of expressing structural relations as grammatical agreement and government, typical of the Russian l~,guage).","Therefore~ in deciding what language units are to be described as permissible in the given con~onent of the CSR, and ~at status is to be attributed to them within its framework, specifically, which units it is best to treat as individual words and ~lich ones should rather be regarded as meaningful parts of words - morphemes (the problem being of particular importance for Japanese where no regular graphical means are used in writ-ing to separate words from each other), we believe it advisable to pay special attention to the functions of the corresponding units in the general structure of the text and in the system of operations used for its processing. With this aim in view, we have devised an operational criterion of distinguishing words and their meaningful parts, based on the principle of the homogeneity of the levels of text processing\" and on the requirement that each level's units should have structurally significant functions within the level 176 itself, while there should also exist a well-defined (although not necessarily one-to-one) correspondence between certain subsets of units belonging to the adjacent levels of processing. According to this criterion, the status of separate words is justified, among others, for such Japanese units as the so-called \"causative voice\" marker -ser u/-sas~ the \"conditional mood\" marker -~, the negation marker -nai (at least, in conditional contexts~d some others. Ajnong units ftulctionally analogous to independent word forms (and, consequently, appearing as such within the CSR), are also classified punctuation marks which are, to our mind, quite similar to words in that they can be meaningful and can correspond to definite translation equivalents (or play the role of such, cf. Japanese ka vs. Russian ?).","In this way, so far as the position of a unit in text structure and in the system of translation transformations is related to the meaning of this unit, our general principles of describing the lexico-grammatical composition of texts in their CSR conform to the requirement of its \"semanticity\". On the other hand, the \"exhaustiveness\" requirement is also met, since we mm/¢e it a point not to leave out of the CSR any text elements, up to those that serve essentially as surface markers of other linguistic units made explicit in this representation, and do not themselves participate to any significant extent in the semantic operations provided in the system (e.g. Japanese \"case\" particles; Russian morphological categories of case, gender and number of adjectives; \"surface\" linguistic expression of \"lexical functions\" and their translation equivalents, etc.). Predicate-argument organization of the text on the semantico-syntactie level","This component of the CSR represents semantico-syntactic links between words and/or quasi-words corresponding to their predicate-arz~ment relations and, accordingly, constituting meaningful text units. It is common knowledge that the surface expression of these units is language-specific while their semantic content is generally assumed to be of a more or less universal nature. So in translation they must either remain essentially the same (naturally, with all the necessary modifications of their surface markers) or must be transformed by certain formal rules depending on the semantic interpretation of the links in question and on their relation with the meaning of the units linked.","The lexico-sy1~tactic translation transformations mentioned are most colmnonly used where the source and the target languages have appreciable typological differences. This is precisely the case with the Japanese-Russian correlation (a simple example: kate-we mannenhitsuo nusumaremashita, lit. \"he was stolen a pen\", transl. Y Hero"]},{"title":"yEpaa~ pyqEy","paragraphs":["\"he had his pen stolen\"). Bearing this in mind we have chosen the dependency grammar to represent the predicate-argument structure of texts in their CSR, preferring it to its alternative - the immediate constituent system, for according to a number of specialists, this type of transformations is easier to describe in dependency terms.","One of the central linguistic problems connected with presenting the predicate-arL~nnent structure of a text in its CSR is which among the various (~u~d often semantically overlapping) dependencies between the text units should be selected for explicit description. In solv-ing this problem we proceed from the principle of the possibility of \"immediate semantic substantiation\" of the dependencies to be selected. It can be specified as the following requirement bearing on the ways and methods of describing words and grammatical constructions when compiling the linguistic information for the automatic translation system:","-","all syntactic dependencies registered in the CSR of a certain text must realize some semantico-syntactic valen-cies of the lexical or grammatical units present in it (and usually forming part of the lexico-grammatical composition of the word forms or quasi-word forms linked by the corresponding dependencies).","These valencies, in their turn, must directly correlate with the semantic characteristics of the units they are ascribed to, semantic considerations viewed as the major factor underlying their assignment to those units. One important consideration of this kind consists in preferring the descriptions where the maximum possible of the valen-cies envisaged could be realized in concrete texts by two-word combinations and the maximum possible of such combinations could be checked for their semantic acceptability (consistency) without regard to any units outside them.","Apart from the situations where some of the syntactically linked units perfoxna in the text processed auxiliary functions (thus having no independent semantic content) the application of the above criteria can only be limited for reasons of economy and effective controllability of 177 the lin~istic description.","From the above it can be inferred that the linguistic information used to reveal ~u]d/or process the predicate-argument structure of concrete texts should combine data on the means of surface expression of the links involved (i.e. word order, function words, etc.) with fairly detailed semantic descriptions of the words to be fin/ted and of their combinatorial potentialities. To provide the formal tools necessary for constructing such descriptions we have devised a special formalized semantic language SLS, the characteristic properties of which ca/l be briefly outlined as follows.","The vocabulary of SL comprises three categories of the so-called semantic elements: categorial elements, encyclopaedic elements and identifying elements. Among these the leading role belongs to the catez'orial elements which are given special descriptions constituting a kind of formalized semantic ~'ra~nmar of the natural language. The sy~tax of SL, used to combine semantic elements into semantic formulae~ accounts both for the se- :**antic relations established between the components of such a formula and for its communicative organization determining the behaviour of its components as regards tile logic operations tllat can be applied to the formula as a whole. From the formal point of view a semantic formula is a linear sequence of symbols, structurally equivalent to a special type of a dependency tree where the nodes can be labeled by tile symbols not only of single sems/~tic elements, but also of their combinations(subtrees)of 8x~y length.","Sema/2tic formulae caxl be employed to express: I) semantic definitions of natural l~u~G-uage tu~its (from a separate word up to a whole text); 2) their paradigma-tic sem~mtic features; 3) their syntagma-tic semantic properties (semantic interpretations of their syntactic valencies).","An important distinguishing characteristics of SL is that it affords formal derivability of information about the semax~tic paradiLnnatic and syntagm,atic features of ls/~guage units from their semantic definitions. This helps to make the sema~tic descriptions of these units more compact (by eliminating the unnecessary reiteration of essentially the sarape data) and to improve their reliability, owing to tl~e possibility of more objectively evaluating the adequacy of semantic definitions on the basis of such a criterion as the degree of correlation between the synta&~natic properties of a unit derivable from its definition, on the one hand, and its actual semantic eombinability as observed in real texts, on the other ha/id. ~oreover, it increases the range of linguistic facts explainable on semantic grounds. Thus, it becomes possible to give uniform rules (unattainable if one stays within tile bounds of purely lexico-syntactic phenomena) for the selection of tile correct morpho-syu~tactical markers (as well as for the appropriate synonymous transformations and logical deductions - operations commonly used as translation devices) when handling constructions with such Russian verbs as"]},{"title":"FpO3HTB (\"run","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"risk\"), 0naCaTBCS (\"fear\"), O~cM~aT~ (\"expect\"), ycneBaT~","paragraphs":["(\"be in time\"), etc., ta/<ing predicate words as their ar~'uments.

However, this kind of transformation would be basically superfluous, for in the synthesis process it would be necessary to reduce the constructions in question back to their elliptical form using but slightly different rules. It seems therefore preferable for the operations of translation proper to result directly in axx elliptical construction analogous to the original one a~d differing only in details of its surface expression (such as the position of negation in the above example), specified by the subsequent synthesis procedure.","So we see that while the component of the CSR under discussion registers only semantically significant phenomena of text structure, the means of representing them in it remain essentially superficial, so as to satisfy both the \"semanticity\" and the \"superficiality\" requirements. Anaphor_ic relations between text units","For interpreting texts in respect of tlleir sicalification and especially denotation, the structure of anaphoric relations between their units is on the whole no less important than their predicate-argument structure. However, the anaphoric structure is expressed mainly by lexical repetition, and this can be easily accounted for if we require that as long as one text is dealt with, one and the same translation equivalent should be selected, so far as possible, for all occurrences of one and the same lexeme (lexeme being defined as a word taken in one of its various lexical meanings). Given this requirement (which appears to be natural enough and, but for some special cases, easy to comply with), there is no need to include this structure in the CSR in its full form. It seems sufficient to indicate it only for those types of language units which directly depend for their translation on the properties of their antecedents in the text at hand. In Japanese (as also in other languagas) there are two types of such units.","The first type are pronouns: when translating, say, the pronoun sore, the choice of one of tile words: thi~, lle~ she, its the, o~ etc.,- as its text equivalent will be determined, among other things, by the syntactic class of the unit chosen as the equivalent of its saltecedent. If this unit is a noun, one will also need to ]~low its number and (for Russia~l) gender.","The second type of units which cannot be translated properly without information about their antecedents is more specific. These are words which are graphically identical with components of more complex units, also lexicalized from the point of view of their semantic behaviourj and which ca~1 function as structural substitutes for the latter. When used in this function, such words must be replaced either by the translation equivalents of their 6uatecederlts I or by pronouns (with the data on these antecedents used in the s~me fashion as in translating usual pronouns). Anyway, their own tra/~slation equivalents are ruled out.","Thus, the word nimotsu, meaning \"lu~'gage\" if used independently, will be translated as \"tllem\" or \"these parcels\" in the context of the sentence","Ko,limo t su-gakari- ~'a mazu nimo t su-no","megata-o hakarimasu, where~Izmotsu is substituted for konimotsu (\"parcel\") :","The clerk dealing with )arcels first"]},{"title":"~i~s ~e~ t t!~9_2~3e~3~","paragraphs":["AS regards all other types of lexical units, our approach is that the existence of' anaphoric relations between them sllould be checked and the relations themselves registered in the CSR for further processing only in those infrequent situations (due mostly to dissimilarities in the combinatorial properties of the original language words and of their tra/Islation equivalents, this necessitating the use of synonymous transfor~nations) where it is impossible to fulfil the above requirement of translating different occurrences of the same lexeme by the sa~,le equivalent, a/Id one has to make sure that employing different equivalents in this case does not affect the original anaphoric structure of the traxlslated text.

To in-corporate these facts in the CSi~, we resort to nuunbering the words in the text processed in the order of their successive occurrence (tile resulting numbers used also, in combination with some other data, as their identifiers throughout the processing).","If, on tile contrary, a construction is characterized by a meaningful word-order relation between its lexical components, it is given the status of a special \"positional unit\", distinct from the constrnction itself and represented explicitly in ~he CSI~. Such a unit directly participates in semantic operations, including those of translation proper, which means that it must flare its own description (in particular, its o~I translation equivalent).

Conclusion","In the foregoing we have tried to show the way the Combined Structural Representation of text reflects the requirements of \"semanticity\", \"superficiality\" and \"exhaustiveness\" formulated at 1'81 tile beginning of the paper as essential for the basic level of fonually representing text structure in an automatic translation system. We shall now briefly recapitulate ~he points.","The \"semanticity '' requirement is accounted for in the CSR, in the first place, by the very possibility provided in it of explicitly describing the five most important aspects of text structure and composition, as stated above. The quest for \"semanticity\" forms also the basis of the principles we employ in selecting concrete information to be made explicit. Among these one can mention the criterion of structural significance of the units to be represented in the CSR as separate words or quasi-words; the principle of \"immediate sems/itic substa~- tiation\" of the predicate-arguJnent syntactic relations registered in it; the requirement of supplying the elements of the lexico-grammatical composition of the text under consideration, as well as of its linear arrangement, with indica-tions of their meaningful or auxiliary role within this text; the employment of a special formal language to define the semantic properties of words and word-combinations, etc. The"]},{"title":"\"superficiality\" of","paragraphs":["the CSR is seen, erelong other things, in the fact that this level of text representation envisages the use of lexico-syntactic translation equivalents and does not necessarily require decomposition of lexerues into combinations of smaller units of mea/~ing, such decomposition considered appropriate but in comparatively rare cases of descriptive and interpretative translation. Other features of the CSR originating from the \"superficiality\" principle are absence of exhaustive information about the anaphoric structure of the text, inclusion of only those data on syntactic word-grouping which are of importance for the translation process, direct tr6u]slation of elliptical constructions, wherever possible, etc.","Finally, the \"exhaustiveness\" requirement is specified as w:hat may be called the \"lose-nothing\" principle of constructing tlle CSR. It inca/is that when special labels are fetched in it to explicitly display various structural elements implicitly present in the surface form of the text at hand, tile surface text markers (such as the \"auxiliary\" type word order; morphological features expressing t~rammatical agreement or government; function words and punctuation marks having no independent translation equivalents, a~d so on), though having been used already to reveal those elements, are not eliminated from the representation being formed. They are merely supplemented by the designations of the elome]its revealed, as well as by formal in-dications of their o~al auxiliary nature, and thus remain accessible for any further analysis that"]},{"title":"might","paragraphs":["prove useful, should it tur~ out that their f~mctions in the text are not limited to just identifying tile units already made explicit.
