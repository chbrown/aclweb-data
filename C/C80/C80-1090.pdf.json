El Colegio de M~xico Camino al Ajusco #20 M~xico 20,D.F.","MEXICO Summary","In order to help to solve the problem of analysing large number of concordances of a given word 'W', the 'Diccionario del Espa~ol de M~xico~ (DEM), has implemented a programme that","i) Reduces this number, as to obtain the maximum possible informati.on with the minimum number of concordances to be handled.","ii) Sortes and rearranges the output so that similar concordances are printed out together.","This was done by comparing up to four words to the left and to the right of word W, through the whole set of concordances, associating toge: ther those which were repeated in a particular context. Once knowing this, some significant concordances were selected to be printed out, and the rest was discarded. I Introduction","In the composition of a dictionary,those involved in the definition of each word have to study very consciously its set of concordances, so that no meaning or use is missed.","there are, of course, some difficulties since on one hand, the sample is never large enough as to insure the occurrence of all the different meanings and uses of every word to be defined. This problem is solved by consulting other dictionaries and expertees on the particular subject.","On the other hand, there are words having a very large number of occurrences, making their analysis a very difficult task, since it is not possible to have present in mind everything that is being analysed. At first thought this could be solved by taking at random a smaller number of concordances; however, when reducing in this way, one is about to loose the grammatical and semantic information contained in all those concordances to be taken away; hence a method had to be implemented as to attain the maximum possible information.","In order to solve this problem, the DEM presents a method whose aim is to obtain optimal information with the minimum number of concordances to be handled.","This method consists of, for each concordance to analyse and compare four words to the left and to the right of word W together with their grammatical category associated; and establishing which one of them is identical to which other in a particular context: A tree structure is generated.","Having known this, it is proceeded to reduce the number, by selecting some of them considered to be representatives. II Preliminary Requirements","Our sample (Corpus del Espa~ol Mexicano Contempor~neo: CEMC), consists of 1,973,151 occurrences, resulting in 65,200 different types, I whose frequency vary from I to 68,252. 2","Some preliminary work has been done consisting in the automatic labeling of each and every word of the corpus with its grammatical category, 2 in which from the total number of occurrences, 1,083,945 were automatically solved, and --590-- the rest had to be solved by hand, then the computer was fed with the results, obtaining in this form, the complete sample labelled. We took advantage of this work, since otherwise it would have been impossible to try to reduce the number of concordances in terms of the same grammatical category.","Next, was to implement a programme that prod£ ces, for any given word, its set of concordances; each word stating its own grammatical category. This is stored in a file called CONCUERDA, and it is organized in the following way:","Every concordance has three lines, each one of them consisting of:","- 6 characters (nnnnnn) reserved for the number","of occurrence.","- 12 characters (tttppplll) reserved for the","register of that line, according to the","original text, and stating text code, page","and line. - 72 characters reserved for the actual text - 18 characters for the label of each word of","the line, stating the grammatical category","code. The first two characters indicate the number of words in the line.","Figure number 1 shows part of file CONCUERDA and its organization. III The Algorithm","3.1 Association of the i-Concordance to table ORDENA.","For each concordance, a table ORDENA is asso-","ciated in the following way:","- The word in question is located in the middle line and associated to ORDENA(5)","- Four words are selected to the right and to the left of W, since they are supposed to be carrying the most significant grammatical and semantic information about the word W. 3 We took this idea from the Centre du Tr#sor de la Langue frangaise\"s work concerning to the treatment of binary groupes Each of the next four words to the right of W will take its place in Oi+ 1 if and only if w5+i ~- 05+i and1# punctuation mark Pi such that w5+i-I Pi w5+i and Pi~{\";:L?i] as they are considered to break up the continuity of a context. In similar way, the words to the left of W are associated to their place in ORDENA.","Figure No. 2 shows how to construct table ORDENA from a given concordance.","3.2 Generation of a Tree Structure startin 9 from ORDENA.","Once obtained this set of up to nine words, it is proceeded to construct a tree structure for the words to the right of W and one for the words to the left of W.","It will only be described here the construction, of the right branch of the tree. The left is generated immediately after, though in symmetric form: - The tree has a root node which is the word W","itself, and has five levels, being the root in","level 5.","- A direct descendant of a node w i is given by the word wj such that wiw j are adjascent, i.e. if"]},{"title":"wi-~ORDENA i and wj.~ORDENAi+ 1 then","paragraphs":["wj is a direct descendant of w i.","- The label of each node consists of: -","Word w associated. -","Its grammatical category. - Its frequency.","And pointers to: - Direct ascendant. - First direct descendant. -","Next node whose direct ascendant is the same","as the one of itself. - Another file called CONCORD, where it is","stored the number of the concordance or","concordances where that word in that"]},{"title":"--591--","paragraphs":["W"]},{"title":"Q","paragraphs":["n ,d o W T h o W o -z o z o ..t\" cO d\" O0 O~ cod\" (0 -'~ d\" I/~ 0D CO O ~OO O ~t 0 O,,-I (3 mo 0 c~o o~D~ I~ O0 1=3 0~0 00=t 0 tt~O ~D 000\", d\" O,,,-I n ~ Z","I-- H OW ~ Z hI~","0 O~ .;.1\" I~ 0 0,1 rn ....~ 00,I ,~ d\" I~ 001'3 ~ eO~O eO0 O ~I ~- ,,.00 00~ \"~P~O 0 040 eO(;O eO0","~o,:,' g ~.o g~° o °':°° C),~ \",.0 C~ 040,1 000 ,,.~0 ~,o, g2-g ~o go,=, '=~,I 0~0 O',cO mO ~1\"0~ O0 0 =.'.1\" i\"- 0..t\"=,1\" O~O 0 O0 ,,.-~ ,-t ,\"r*, ,..Oi '~- oO', n'~ec ,,-40 C, JO -.1\" ~0 c3o (:z, fO ~, ,::}","b'} ),- U') ,~ u~ o ~ U~ ~ WbJ >.. ,< Z ~ -Z ' -0 J 0 0~ 0 b..I .~ ,< 0 H ,,J ,,~n,' ~ OI-- ~E ~OZ r ~ , .Jr~O ~ I~ J,mW (:3 17'1 I--~ OV~J ~ ~ 0 \"~",",~ (J, ,~,,~ ,.J 0 O0 O rr' ~C ZO ..J ~,,.-, - O0 I-- 0 bJ~- m,,~° O~ W~ ~ r~-r -r 0 n ~ b~ ,,:(J ~ n.'~.

Once the tree is fully constructed it is proceeded to make the actual reduction. There are some facts to be considered beforehand: The more words repeated exactly in the same context, the greater is the probability that the meaning of the word W in that context is the same. A set of words repeated a small number of times may be more significaqt than another one repeated a larger number of times since there are not so many different meanings or grammatical functions of ~ word W followed by the s~ me set of words. Next, it will be described the proced ure: In order to analyse the tree, a leftmost path is followed. - A 6th level branch of the tree is first analysed (Remember that the root is in level 5, and that the tree to the right of W is being analysed). If the frequency is greater than I, then its leftmost direct descendant is analysed in the same way. If a 9th level rode is reached in this form, and the frequency n > I, it means that the words W followed by these four words ocurred a times in n different concordances. As it was said before there is a good probability that the meaning of the word W in this particular context is the same in all of the n concordances\" hence, by talking only one or two of them, by means of a random function, we obtain a significant concordance, and the ( n - 1) or (n-2) left can be safely omited from the final output.","- If at same intermediate level it is found that the frequency of the word associated to that ~ode is I, then the analysis of such branch would have to be stopped; however, it was thought that a possible way to reduce was not by identical words but by the same grammatical category. It is proceeded then to find all direct descendants of its own direct ascendant with the same frequency and grammatical category, and then the number of these concordances is reduced. It is clear that the process takes into account that as the level of reduction is closer to 5, then the context is less significant; hence a larger number of concordances have to be chosen to mantain the required quality information. After some study and many trials it was empirically decided by our team of linguists* that a reasonable pattern of reduction was the following: If the level of reduction is 4 or 6 and the frequency F~ 30 then the number of concordances selected Q would be Q=F//2 + I and Q=F//4 if F>30. If level is 7 or 3 then Q = F//3 + 1 for F~50 Q = F//5 for F >50 If level is 8 or 2 then Q = F//4+I ~or F~70 Q = F//7 for F>70 Finally, if level is 9 or I then Q = F//5 + 1 for F~ 50 Q = F//IO + i for F>50 * At this point, we would like to thank in particular to Paulette Levy for her valuable discussions and interesting suggestions. --595--","It has to be mentioned here, that this pattern of reduction may be changed according to the wprd analysed., as to obtain the best results each time.","When it is already Known the number of concordances that will be chosen ( Q out of F) it is proceeded to select them again, by means of a random function, and each one of them is marked as such, to avoid any one of them be selected twice or more times. 3.4 Output.","The final output is presented indicating the group of words repeated the grammatical category of the last word when applicable and the frequency.

We made use of 3 files: a) File CONCUERDA, where the whole","set of concordances of the word","W was stored, and it was described above.","b) Files ARBOL and CONCORD~ these two files are supposed to contain the information obtained while generating the right and left trees. ARBOL: Each node of the tree is stored in a line composed of 72 characters, distributed in the following way: 7 for its own address in file ARBOL I for the level 24 for the word 2 for the grammatical category 3 for the leng~ of the wo~d 4 for the frequency 7 for the address of its direct ascendant 7 for the address of the next direct descendant of its own direct ascendant (i.e. like next brother) 7 for the address of the first direct descendant 4 for the number of direct descendants (i.e. No of branches emerging from it) and 6 for the address in file CONCORD","where it is stored the number of","the concordance where it comes from, From the com#utational point of view,","each one of the trees is generated in","the following way: -","The root, whose node associated is the word W is in a prefixed address, and it will be present in every concordance. This word is taken from ORDENA (5) -","The next word in ORDENA will be stored by means of a hash function, and it is decided to be the same node as one previously stored, if and only if the word, its grammatical category, level and direct ascendant are exactly the same, in such case the frequency is aumented by one and in file CONCORD is stored the number of this concordance in addition to the previous one. --596-- O r-, L~ t3d / n J Id L/1 cl ,j c2~ O u o r~ -/ I-- o I-.. o z :3 Ld Z O I!

V Results And Applications~","The first results were very encouraging, since for those words with medium number of concordances say up to 600 - we were able to reduce the number between 30% and 40%, according to the word in question. No lost information was reported (by comparing the original set of concordances with the reduced version)","It is expected that for words with higher frequency, the method here des. cribed will be more efficient.","However, from the computational point of view, there are still some difficulties, since the generation of each tree is very time consuming as the frequency of the word in question increases. ~e are still working to optimize it.","The most important application besides the original main objectives, is that by this method it is possible to find expressions and patterns of language repeated and used consistently.
