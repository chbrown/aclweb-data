Summary","Model theoretic semantics (MTS) has a special attitude to describe semantics, to characterize both artificial and natural languages by pure mathematical tools and some of the basic properties of this attitude are disscussed. The arsenal of MTS equipped here with such tools allowing the investigation at such a level of complexity that approximates the real situations. These tools are developed within the frame of category theory.","i. The challan~e of formal ha ndlin@ of semantics","For long times, natural language has been regarded as some very soft, amorphous, and whimsical phenomenon. Although theoretical considerations showed that this may not be so, the very fact that actual linguistic methodology was quite soft and intuitive seemed to confirm the conviction that language cannot be treated very rigorously. It is clear, however, that the more explicit and transparent framework we use for handling a very complex phenomenon, the more can learn about what its complexity really consists of. It has been the use of more or less mathematical- -minded methods improving the situation in recent decades.","A very important first step in the direction of establishing such a framework has been generative grammar.

This attitude provides the investigation of natural language on an abstract level. Namely, it answers the question in the most abstract sense what language is and what its basic components are. The basic properties of the MTS's attitude are analysed in [31. 2. What is MTS?","Language can be analysed only through analysing language carriers. From the different possible functions, the language possesses, we find the cognitive one the most significant and this answers our question above. Considering a language carrying system /whether it be human or a machine or else/ the cognitive function is real-ized while the language is used to describe objects and events of the environment under cognition. Characterising language we abstract from the cognitive process itself and from the internal 213 organization of the system. Our mere concern is the outcome of the cognitive process, that is, descriptive texts and their relation to the environment which they refer to. MTS attitude demands an ideal external observer (EO) who is to model the system (S) and the system's environment world (W). EO forms models of S, of W and of the S-W relation. In order that EO should be able to","form the intended models, he must pos-","sess the following kinds of knowledge","about the sample situation (and EO being","an ideal observer, we assume he really","does): (i) EO knows the aspect and the","level at which S may perceive","and describe the environment;","in other words, EO knows S's","sensitivity. (ii) EO knows those fundamental as-","pects of W that S may","describe.","(i)-(ii) together ensure that EO models W adequately with respect to S.","(iii)EO knows that S is finite whereas W is both infinite and infinitely complex.","(iv) EO knows that S's actual environment is accidental. The knowledge S may obtain at each stage of its cognition is compatible with infinitely many possible worlds. The S-W relation is therefore uncertain: the texts of S always correspond to infinitely many environments, rather than a unique one.","On the basis of (i)-(iv) EO forms the following models: The model of S will just be a system producting texts (more precisely, the material bodies of texts, whatever they should be). In case EO happens to be a mathematician,Model (S) will be a formal grammar capable of generating the texts of the language.","The model of W is a metalinguistic description of the world, adequate to S' s sensitivity. For purely theoretical purposes, EO only has to take into account that S has some fixed though arbitrary sensitivity, determining the possible character of the objects and phenomena of W S may describe. When modelling some concrete language, S's sensitivity is also fixed though no longer arbitraryly . In case EO happens to be a mathematician, Model (W) will be a mathematical object. Because of the uncertainty of the S-W relation,Model(W) is a class of models of infinitely many possible worlds.","The model of the S-W relation is some correspondance between elements of texts and things in the world-models. In case EO happens to be a mathematician, Model(S-W) can be a class of relations or functions.","We have reached the point where we may define language as it appears at this level of abstraction. By an abstraot language La we mean a triple <Model (S), Model (W~, Model (S-W)>. Furthermore, we call Model (S) the syntax of LA, and Model (W) and Model (S-W) together the semantics of L A. We emphasize that all these models are formed by an ideal external observer and are described in his own language.","The aboves illustrated by the following figure. ~ystem S ~i~etn~i t !_ -"]},{"title":"....... _==) odo ,}","paragraphs":["In the case of classical mathematical logic first of all a similarity type t is fixed (t is a function that renders a natural number, the arity, to each relation and function symbols of the basic alphabet, i.e. of the signature}.

With the growth of the observable environment the corresponding knowledge also widens. The latter needs new language elements so as to be described. Therefore some words change their meanings, new concepts appear which emerge into new sublanguages.","E.g. the word \"tree\" has quite a different meaning for a woodman, for a biologist, for a painter, for a child, for a linguist, for a mathematician, etc. The different meanings are con~ nected with different sublanguages which are but different sociolects in this case.","However the sublanguages are not independen t .

But this is not the case because among most of the sublanguages there are some transition possibilities e.g. translation, interpretation.","The MTS attitude possesses tools (developed within the frame of mathematical logic) by the use of which the homogeneous cases can be described.

Mathematical logic provides tools only for the case when the languages have the same signature, i.e. when their alphabet is the same. In this case the notion of homomorphism is powerful enough to describe the connection between the languages.

E.g. let us have two languages physics and biology and we want to establish connection between them. For this we should analyse the connection between the corresponding knowledges.However this analysis, as usual, cannot be established directly. A mediator theory is needed. The mediator is an interdisciplinary theory, e.g. the language of general system theory (see e.g. [2]). By the use of the mediator a new language with a new kind of knowledge arizes from the input languages, namely biophysics.","Our aim is the extension of the MTS attitude to analyse the semantics of many-purpose languages and language hierarchies. We develop such tools (wlth-in the frame of mathematical logic) by the use of which EO can model a language carrying system not only in a homogeneous situation, but in a heterogeneous one too, the complexity of which approximates the real cases.","Here we only outline the basic idea providing the basic notions, since the bounds of this paper do not allow us to give a detailed description of the tools This can be found in [i].","Although the first order classical languages do not seem to be adequate for linguistics, it still provides basis for any MTS research.
