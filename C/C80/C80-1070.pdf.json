Therefore a task-independent Japanese text input system which has a speech analyzer as a main input device and a keyboard as an auxiliary device was designed and it has been implemented. The outline and experience of this system is described in this paper.","The system consists of the phoneme discrimination part and the word discrimination part.","Acoustic analysis and phonemic discrimination are effectively performed using an estimation method of the articulatory motion from speech waves in the phoneme discrimination part. And its outputs are lattices of Japanese pseudo-phonemes corresponding to speech inputs.","In the word discrimination part, phonemic strings are corrected using various kinds of a priori knowledge anu transformed into suitable kinds of characters. On behalf of it, this part mainly consists of the refrieval of the word dictionary indexed by vowels, and the similarity calculation using dynamic programming. i. Introduction","Speech recognition systems can be classified according to whether they recognize isolated or connected words. But in either case, word recognition has been thought a basic problem. In the speech understanding system, a method of utilizing various kinds of a priori knowledge, which is obtained from a phonemic, a syntactic and a semantic level on clearly defined tasks, has been developed. And it has been clarified how information at each level contributes to recognition. I-~","While many understanding systems set the goal at the understanding of contents of speech, our nain object is the task-independent Japanese texts input system. Because a system which utilizes properties of a task too much is not so practical and the phonemic discrimination must be the core of the speech recognition system. This system consists of the phoneme discrimina~ tion part and the word discrimination part.","In the phoneme discrimination part, connected spoken words is segmented into discrete phonemic strings. The main difficulties at this step are the large variation of each utterance and the coarticulation, and the difference between talkers. So it is important to select acoustic parameters which aren't relatively affected by these variations.","This system employs the feature extracton method based on the speech production model. The articulatory motion for the utterance is estimated from speech waves, and the phonemic discrimination is performed using the trace of them. The followings are the merits to describe the acoustic feature at an articulatory level: (i) Processing of coarticulation may be considered most clearly in relation to the physiological factor of speech production. (2) Adaptation to a speaker is easier than other methods.","Nevertheless it is almost impossible to construct perfect phonemic strings corresponding to spoken words only by the phonemic discrimination. So in the word discrinimation part, the phonemic strings are corrected using various kinds of a priori information. At the same time, it is neccessary to transform the phonemic strings into the suitable kinds of characters in order to print the texts. Because written Japanese texts are expressed by many kinds of characters, which are Kanji (ideo-graphic character), Hira-gana (cursive form of Kana, Japanese syllabary), Kata-kana (square form of Kana) and special symbols.","The confusion matrix between phonemes, the phonemic connective rules, the word dictionary and so on have been already used as a priori information in word discrimination systems, and their validity has been also ascertainedl '~°6","Therefore, theword discrimination part mainly consists of the retrieval of the word dictionary which is indexed by vowels, and the similarity calculation using dynamic programming and the phonemic confusion matrix. Because the phoneme discrimination part can recognize vowels more correctly than consonants and the phonemic confusion matrix reflects the characteristics of the phoneme discrimination part exceedingly.","In order to translate from Kana to Kanji, some ,~ systems with the word dictionary for Kana-Kanji translation and with syntax and semantics analyzer, are suggested. But the task domain should be restricted so as to get the high translation rate.","Main difficulties of Kana-kanji translation are as follows: (i) Segmentation from input character s'trings to words. (2) Identification of synonyms In this system, identifiers inserted from a simple keyboard serve as spaces between words. And the difficulty of the latter is solved by redundant inputs since speech input is much easier than other input techniques.","m --464-- micropho~ne"]},{"title":"phoneme recognition keyboard syntactic","paragraphs":["~_"]},{"title":"approach l l ] ~wo~a ~efe~en~e~___~ matching I","paragraphs":["KANJI"]},{"title":"printer I Fig 1-1 Block diagraB of the system","paragraphs":["The paper is structured as follows.

These results are shown in Table 2-4.","The attempt to extract the feature of consonants from the gliding part of the articulatory motion in the following vowel was successful to some extent.

Word discrimination 3.i How to input Japanese texts","Ideally speaking, texts which are arbitrarily pronounced should be recognized perfectly and suitable Kana-Kanji translation should be performed. But the phonemic discrimination, the processing of synonyms and so on are actually very difficult. So the system uses a simple keyboard as an auxiliary input device, it has only 7 keys and it is enough manageable by one hand.","In case of input, first of all, a key indicating the kind of the character must be pushed. For example, 'H' indicates Hira-gana. For Kanji, the reading of the compound word, On-yomi (the phonetical reading of Kanji) and Kun-yomi (the Japanese rendering of Kanji) constructing the word are pronounced. Since the acoustic input is much easier than the other input techniques, some redundant data can be inputted with less burden. In the current version, a key indicating the kind of the reading pronounced is pushed for the sake of the easy processing.","For Hira-gana, a speaker may pronounce a word which contains its reading as the ending.

So the system utilizes the nature of Japanese that almost all short Hira-gana strings are found as the inflectional part or Joshi (auxiliary word in Japanese). For the former, a user may pronounce a word which contains the inflection and the system uses them as a redundant data using the inflection dictionary. For the latter, the dictionary containing Joshi and its connection information is used as a priori information.","In case of Kata-kana, as the usage is restricted to the words of foreign origin, the phonemic correction is performed using the loanword dictionary. At this time, the algorithm of Fig.3-2 is available.","Besides, Japanese text input system must process special characters, for example numbers, alphabets, punctuation marks and so on. But they are a few, so the above algorithm can processed them using special character table. 4. Conclusion","At present, the system uses YHP-21MX and the special purpose hardware for the phonemic data extraction, and the phoneme and the word discrimination part are built on HITAC 8800/8700 at the Computing Centre of the University of Tokyo. Though the performance, the facility and the bottle-neck as the total system has not been clarified as yet, partially some results and problems have been found.","The phoneme discrimination part aims at recognizing connected speech uttered by an unspecified speaker. On behalf of it, the feature extraction method at the articulatory level is tried. As a result, stable articulatory motion is estimated with the satisfactory precision for vowels, and the validity of it is confirmed. And the adapta-tion for speakers is effectively performed. For consonants, the feature extraction method using the transient part of the articulatory motion is tried, but it has a little drawpoint at the precision and the stability of articulatory parameters. It is also influenced by a speaker. A combination to the other sound parameters will perhaps make the system improve.","For the word discrimination, the syntax has not been used except for Hira-gana at this version. Hereafter it is planned to incorporate the syntactic information as much as possible for the improvement of the performance. But the trade-off between the facility and the processing speed is an important problem. Acknowledgment","The authors wish to thank J.Kubota, T.
