The global construction of a sentence in this language is highly schematic, but allows expressions in the chosen language such as Japanese or English. Its artificial language part, SML, is closely related to our newly introduced data model, called scaled lattice. Adopting Japanese as its natural language part, we implemented a Japanese-SML hybrid language processing system for our compact database system SCLAMS, whose database consists of scaled lattices. The main features of this implementation are (i) a small lexicon and limited grammar, and (2) an almost free form in writing Kana Japanese. 1. Introduction","Various query languages for database access have been developed, among which unambiguous artificial ones are better adapted to computers. For man, on the other hand, it would be more convenient to communicate with computers in a natural language. The possibility of man-machine communication in a natural language has been one of the main concerns in the field of artificial intelligence, and considerable results have been obtained specifically in research into natural language access to a database. I~5 These results, however, seem to be too complex and inflexible for practical application to general-purpose database systems.","We will propose in this paper a \"natural-artificial hybrid\" language for database access. The global construction of a sentence in this language is highly schematic but allows expressions in the chosen language such as Japanese or English. A Japanese version of this language has been implemented for our compact database system SCLAMS6;(SCaled LAttice Manipulation System).

SML:Scaled lattice manipulation language 2.1 Scaled lattice as a data model","What the normalization theory in the relational data model tells us can be stated very loosely as \"one fact in one place\" 8 The concept of Scaled Lattice, or S.L. for short, also goes along this direction.","Roughly speaking an S.L. is a multi-dimensional table, and is defined as a collection of data of one species arranged at multi-dimensional lattice points corresponding to the combinations of attribute values. Fig. 1 shows a graphical image of S.L. which represents population data by year, prefecture, and sex.

Female popul~ tion of Tokyo in 1980. Prefecture"]},{"title":"r o ~","paragraphs":["All of male population data are arranged on this axis.","Fig. 1 Graphical image of S.L. data model --543--","This is an example of three dimensional S.L's, which can be furthermore regarded as a mapping or a function with three variables in the mathematical sense. Let SI, $2, and $3 be finite sets such as S1 = { 1950, 1951 ..... 1980}, { Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya .... }, $2 and $3 ={ male, female}. Also let A be an appropriate set having enough elements to represent values of population. Then the above S.L. can be naturally regarded as a mapping: F : S1 x $2 x S3 ~ A, (i) which associates any triple (x, y, z) of attribute values in S1 x $2 x $3 with the corresponding population value F(x, y, z). Thus, for example, F (1980, Tokyo, male) denotes the male population of Tokyo in 1980.","Generally an S.L. is a mapping F of the direct product of finite sets SI, ..., Sn into an appropriate set A denoted by F : S1 x ... x Sn~ A. (2) These sets S1, ..., Sn and their elements will be sometimes called root words and leaf words respectively.","The following are the advantages of this data model:"]},{"title":"(i","paragraphs":["Data contained in an S.L. can be displayed exactly in the two-dimensional table form, which is visually very understandable."]},{"title":"(2","paragraphs":["In order to display data in table form, it is necessary to cut out an appropriate two-dimensional cross section from the S.L., or more precisely to select two appropriate scales on which the table is constructed, and, at the same time, to fix the remaining scales at some attribute values. This is nothing but a retrieval operation. Cutting out such a section is very easy, which means that certain retrieval operations are also easy."]},{"title":"(3","paragraphs":["Since an S.L. is regarded as a mapping, precise and powerful notations concerning \"sets and mappings\" are directly applicable for manipulation of the S.L. data. 2.2 Brief outline of SCLAMS","We have implemented a compact database system SCLAMS (Scaled lattice manipulation system), whose database consists of S.L.'s.6, 7 SCLAMS has the following three major modes:"]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["Storage mode: Storage of data as a set of S.L.'s editing from any file into the database.","(2) Retrieval mode: Selection of one or more suitable S.L.'S from the database.","(3) Manipulation mode: Data extraction from the above S.L.'s and some operation on the data.","Thus, a retrieval operation according to a user's query is divided into two modes: Retrieval and Manipulation. Retrieval mode is similar to the document retrieval system, and ManiPulation mode to the database system, in a narrow sense, regarding each S.L. as a small file. The main concern of our design of SCLAMS was to combine effectively these two modes, in other words, to integrate the function of document retrieval systems and that of database systems.","2.3 Manipulation of scaled lattices by SML","In this paper we will focus our attention exclusively on Manipulation mode of SCLAMS. The major function of this mode is to manipulate S.L.'s in a variety of ways such as extraction of data satisfying specified conditions, join of more than two S.L.'s data, elementary calculations for extracted data, etc. These operations are done through a query language for end users, named as SML (Scaled lattice Manipulation Language).","We now show a few examples to illustrate some aspects of SML. Let F1 and F2 be two S.L.'s, i.e. two mappings such as F1 : Slx $2 x S3~AI, and (3 F2 : S1 x $2 ~A2, (4 where S1 = Year scale"]},{"title":"{ 1950, 1951 ..... 1980}, (5","paragraphs":["--544 $2 = Prefecture scale = { Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya,..), (6) $3 = Sex scale = { male, female}, (7) A1 = Set of population values,","A2 = Set of numbers of TV subscribers. These S.L.'s may be considered as an output of Retrieval mode.","Each example below consists of an informal query and the corresponding formal one expressed by SML. Notice that the SML expressions contain the mathematical notations to describe sets and mappings.","Example i. List the male population of Tokyo in 1980. LIST A; A = FI(1980, Tokyo, male);","Example 2. List names and the number of prefectures in which the male population in 1980 is greater than one million. LIST B, C;","B = <X:FI(1980, X, male)> 1,000,000>; C = COUNT (B);","In this example B is defined as the set of prefecture X's with the population value FI(1920, X, male) > 1,000,000, and C as COUNT of B, where COUNT is one of aggregate functions prepared in SCLAMS.","Example 3. List numbers of TV subscribers in 1980 of prefectures £n which the female population in 1975 is less than one million. LIST NUM; NUM = F2(1980, P);","P = <X:FI(1975, X, female) <i,000,000>;","In this example two S.L.'s F1 and F2 are related by a common scale $2.","General format of a query or a sentence by SML is shown in Fig. 2. LIST al, a2, ..., am; bl = expression i; b2 = expression 2; bn = expression n; Fig. 2 General format of a query by SML In this format each of variables al,..., am is equal to one of those bl, ..., bn; and the order of bl, ..., bn is arbitrary. The types of expressions can be classified into £he following six categories: i) Numeral or literal constants; e.g. 1980, Tokyo, male, etc. 2) Aggregate function values; e.g. COUNT (x), SUM (y), etc. 3) S.L.'s values; e.g. F(xl .... , xn) , etc. 4) Set operation formulas; e.g. x & y, xly, x-y, etc. 5) Set definition formulas; e.g. <3, 5, 7, ii>, <Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka>, <xi:F(xl,...,xi, ...,xn)<y>, etc.","6) Abbreviate notations for elements of a scale, i.e. leaf words; e.g. S.l, S.II-20, etc.","• The latter, for example, represents from llth to 20th elements of a scale S.","It would be easily seen, from the above explanation, that a query by SML is expressed basically as a set of \"nonprocedural\" local queries, and thus the query as a whole has also of nonprocedural nature.","3. Hybridization of SML with a natural language 3.1 An illustrative example","We have assured that our query language SML is sufficiently flexible and has strong expressive power, specifically for those who are familiar --545-- with mathematical notations concerning sets and mapping s . However, we can also say that SML is less convenient than a natural language which seems to be best suited for casual users. We therefore tried to hybridize SML with a natural language like English, Japanese, etc., believing that such a natural-artificial hybrid language should be one of the milestones to a realization of database systems wholly accessible via unrestrict-ed natural languages.","The next example, closely related to Example 2 in the last section, will show us how to hybridize SML with a natural language, say English.","Example 4. List names and the number of prefectures in which the male population in 1980 is less than the female population of Tokyo in 1970.","Now we consider the following two types of expressions for this query.","T_~e I (Original formal expression by SML) LIST A, B; A = <X:FI(1980, X, male) < C >; B = COUNT (A) ; C = FI(1970, Tokyo, female); Type II (Extended new expression) LIST A, B;","A = Names of prefectures in which the male population in 1980 is less than C; B = Number of elements of A;","C = Value of the female population of Tokyo in 1970; The features of Type II expressions are:"]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["The global construction is quite similar to that of Type I expression, but it allows us to write phrases in the chosen natural language for definitions of variables such as A, B, and C. (If necessary, some of the variables may retain the original formal definitions.)"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["Notice that variable symbols such as A and C can be embedded in ordinary English phrases, so that the original query expressed as a complex sentence is divided into some simple queries. This contributes to readability of queries both for man and computer. 3.2 Features of a Japanese-SML version","We have implemented a \"Japanese-SML\" hybrid language processing system, as an extension of SCLAMS. The major design goal was to be practical rather than just ambitious. The processing system, which will be called Translator, is essentially a translator of a Japanese phrase into the corresponding SML expression, or in the above terminology, of a Type II expression into its Type I equivalent. The main process of Translator is shown in Fig. 3. Type II eipression Syntax Analysis l<-------- Conversion .... ] ~- Type I expression Japanese Grammar Rules Fig. 3 Process of Translator","Some considerations in achieving practicability of the implemented system are :","(i) In our implementation a Japanese sentence or phrase can be written as a string of only Kana characters, in which case it is desirable, for convenience, to guarantee freedom from segmentation as much as possible. Our system indeed allows the free writing of a Kana sentence, as long as the leaf words (the elements of scales) cause no confusion with the reserved words in the lexicon.","(2) It is desirable to keep the grammar as compact as possible to save storage space and processing time. This was done by restricting forms of possible Type II expressions. 4. Translation of Japanese into SML 4.1 Micro-grammar for Japanese","As mentioned in Section 2.3, the set of all Type I expressions are 546 classified into six categories i)~6). Then the possible Type II expressions, which our Translator can accept, are restricted to those corresponding to the categories 2), 3), and a part of 5), i.e. the so-called implicit set definitions. It should be noticed that expressions belonging to the other categories are neatly expressed rather by Type I forms.","We now show the lexicon and the grammatical rules prescribing these Type II expressions.","Lexical items and their categories. There are 12 categories of lexical items. l) Num : Numbers, e.g. 12, 165.3, -0.137, etc. 2) Naux: Auxiliary numbers, e.g. hyaku, byaku, pyaku, sen, man (hundred, thousand, million), etc.","3) ~ : Names of aggregate functions, e.g. kosu, souwa, saidai, heikin (count, sum, maximum, average), etc.","4) e~ : Equality words or copulas, e.g. no, dearu, deatte, nihitoshii, nihitoshiku (is equal to), etc. 5) ~: Words for comparison, e.g. ijo, ika, miman, igo (more, less, later), etc. 6) Comp____~2: Particle for comparison, i.e. yori, yorimo ( % than)."]},{"title":"7)","paragraphs":["adj : Adjectives, e.g. ookii, hayail shouno, daino (large, early, small, wide), e tc.","8)* Root : Root words, i.e. names of scales, e.g. nen, ken (year, prefecture), etc.","9)* Leaf : Leaf words, i.e. elements of scales, e.g. 1980, Tokyo, otoko (male), etc. l0 * Unit: Words for data units, e.g. en, nin, km (Yen, person, kilometer), etc.","ii) * SL : Names of S.L.'s representing the sort of the S.L. data, usually given at Storage mode, e.g. jinko, TV keiyakusha (population, TV subscriber), etc. 12)** Var: Variable names such as A, B, KEN, etc.","The items in the categories marked by one asterisk are automatically added to the lexicon at the beginning of Manipulation mode in order to cover those S.L.'s which are passed from Retrieval mode, and deleted after use. They are thus highly application oriented.","The lexicon would become very large if it included the items in Leaf category. We tried to exclude them from our lexicon by contriving a recognition method of them from the contexts, so that the lexicon contains only about 100 application independent items plus application oriented ones.","Var category marked by two asterisks was also excluded from our lexicon, since the formation rules of this category is well-defined and easily programmed.","Grammatical rules.

Since the proposed grammar is so compact, we considered that the conversion procedure including syntax analysis would be best realized through a general-purpose programming language, say PL/I, rather than a comprehensive grammar-writing system like ATN. 9) This will also contribute to a portability of the system.

ConcluSions","Our compact database system SCLAMS with a translator from Japanese into SML has been implemented for IBM 370/138. The translator is a PL/I program consisting of about 500 statements including the lexicon and the grammatical rules themselves. The overall performance of the translator seems to be sufficient for practical use. In fact, the translation time of each Type II expression is about 1 second.","We believe, from our experiences, that a natural-artificial hybrid language like ours will be a practical step to explore the better languages for database access, specifically for casual users.","Acknowledgement.
