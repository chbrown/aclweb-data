Kume","Department of Electrical Engineering","Kyoto University Sakyo, Kyoto, 606, JAPAN Summary A machine translation system from Japanese into English is described. The system aims at translation of computer manuals, and basically follows to the transfer approach. The design principles of the system are discussed in detail, together with the overall constructions of the system. Especially, the effectiveness of lexicon-based procedures, i.e. lexicon-based analysis, transfer, and synthesis, is emphasized. Most of the linguistic phenomena are treated by using lexical descriptions and lexical rules, instead of by general syntactic rules. Because Japanese and English belong to quite different language families, much more structural transfers are necessary than in other MT systems among European languages. Special cares have been paid for designing the transfer component. Some translation results are also given to illustrate the current abilities of the system. i. Introduction This paper is the first progress report of a machine translation system from Japanese into English being developed at Kyoto University. The project currently aims at the translation of computer manuals, in which vocabulary is rather limited and less ambiguous than in other subject fields. However, this system is a good example of MTsvste~swhose SL's and TL's belong to quite different language families, in which a lot of interesting problems have arisen that have been concealed in the systems whose language pairs are rather close in language families. We will discuss in the paper some of the design principles without referring to the detailed linguistic phenomena. The system has been implemented on FACOM M-200 (Kyoto University Computing Center) mostly by LISP. Only exception is the morphological analysis of Japanese, which is done by PL/i program. The system basically follows to 'transfer approach' advocated by several other groups such as TAUM, GETAetc. (1) The overall system consists of the three major components; Japanese analysis~ transfer, and English synthesis components ss shown in Fig. i. The system is based on several guiding principles. Among these, the followings would distinguish our system from the other MT systems.","i. It is highly lexicon-driven. Every component including analysis, transfer and synthesis components is highly dependent on lixical descriptions of individual words. In other words, most of the linguistic phenomena are treated by lexical descriptions and lexical rules, instead of general syntactic rules such as 'structure","dependent rules'in Chomskian grammar. We complete-","ly agree with J. Bresnan, an MIT linguist, when she","claimed as follows: (2) 'Finally, I assume that it is easier for us to look something up than it is to compute it. It does in fact appear that our lexical capacity -- the long-term capability to remember lexical information -- is very large.'","2. The approach becomes closer to the interlingual approach. Because Japanese structures can be adequately captured by dependency structures based on case notions, we adopted this structure as the intermediate representation for Japanese. On the other hand, the structures from which synthesis of English will start are ordinary phrase structures. It is well known that dependency structures require semantically deeper analyses than usual phrase structures. Therefore, our approach becomes closer to the interlingual approach, and even undistinguish-able with it in some cases. Especially, because the two languages have quite different systems for expressing tenses, modals, aspects etc., these expressions are analyzed into much deeper levels, that is, almost the i~terlingu~llevel. Considering the fact that the two languages belong to quite different language families, our approach seems to be inevitable.","3. Stereotyped or semi-stereotyped expressions found in computer manuals are effectively utilized. Stereotyped expressions here mean not only idioms in a usual sense, but also certain stylistic prototypes which can often be found in manuals. Special cares have been taken to utilize them effectively in our system."]},{"title":"JIS .l I v I Transfer] ~ EIS","paragraphs":["Japanese ~ ~ English Analysis ['~_J ~_J [ Synthesis","Japanese English","Sentence Sentence JIS : Japanese Intermediate Structure","(Dependency Structure Based on Cases) EIS : English Intermediate Structure","(Phrase Structure Tree) AD : Analysis Dictionary for Japanese BD : Bilingual Dictionary SD : Synthesis Dictionary for English Fig. i Overall Construction of the MT System 414 2.

However, the co-operation should be done in different ways. Generally speaking, English morphological analysis needs much help from its syntactic analysis. English homograms can rare-ly be resolved by intra-word processings. Therefore, morphological analysis alone will produce highly ambiguous results in English. Syntactic and even semantic information is required to resolve them. On the contrary, Japanese morphological analysis offers much help to its syntactic analysis. This implies that Japanese morphological analysis can be done in a separate phase with syntactic and other succeeding processings. Because Japanese morphological analysis is close-ly related to both the writing system and detailed word inflection rules of Japanese, we shall omit the discussion of this phase, only noting that certain composite expressions are treated in our system as single morphemes. Some examples are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 Examples of Composite Morphemes","2-1. Lexicon Based Analysis Procedure for Japanese In order to discuss the other analysis steps, we have to mention certain syntactic aspects of Japanese. Among those, it should be noted that case relationships between noun phrases and verbs are usually marked by case suffixes attached to noun phrases. An example is shown in Fig. 3. ~ h. v ~ 7~, ~- ~ -~ ~ U~r ~o I case suffix: r ga de wo W","noun : noun : noun : verb : user program data to modify meaning : (The) user modifies (the) data by (a) program. Note : ~(ga), %\"(de), and ~(wo) are the case suffixes. In Japanese, noun phrases which bear some grammatical relationships with a verb always precede the verb in a surface sentence. Fig. 3 Case Suffixes in Japanese ~(ga) usually marks AGENTIVE, ~(wo) OBJECTIVE and %~(de) INSTRUMENTAL cases, respectively. However, this direct correspondence between surface case suffixes and deep cases may not be preserved in actual sentences. In other words, case suffixes indicate only surface grammatical relationships between noun phrases and a verb, and these grammatical relationships may not coincide with deep semantic cases. We should distinguish them carefully, as C. Fillmore did in English. He tried to set up general rules to relate deep cases with surface grammatical relationships in English. Unfortunately, his model is based on generating sentences and gives us no clue as to how to parse them. Moreover, we observed that, at least in Japanese, this surface and deep correspondence ismore or less specific to individual verbs. The same phenomena have been observed in English by J. Bresnan and other linguists.(2)They have treated these phenomena by setting up 'lexical interpretation rules' which are specific to individual verbs, and which translate the surface grammatical structures into deep semantic ones. From computational view points, this fremework leads us to lexicon-based analysis procedures. Instead of general syntactic rules, we describe specific surface-deep mappings for individual verbs in the analysis dictionary, as shown in Fig. 4. One of the main purposes to establish transformation rules was to relate surface structures with deep ones by the rules. In our framework, most of this task is done by surface-deep mappings described in the dictionary. Therefore, a simple pattern matching is sufficient to analyze sentence fragments, that contain only one verb. However, there still remain certain sets of transformations which seem not to be well captured by the surface-deep mappings of individual verbs. We also treat them as lexical rules. We will discuss this point in the next section. - 415-"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["(to moaify)","surface pattern : i ~, 2 ~ 3","(ga) (de) (wo)","deep structure : (* MODIFY (AGENT (1))(INST (2))(OBJ (3)))","In the actual inplementation, sets of semantic restriction are described here.

Transformations as Lexical Rules Transformations treated by our system can be classified into the following categories (Notice that we use here the term 'transformations' in a broader sense than in traditional TG. And also notice that, though 'scrambling' operations are very conspicuous in Japanese which are applied after transformation cycles in traditional TG's, we do not consider them as transformations here, because they can be embodied in pattern matching operations, i.e., pattern matchings without considering orders of elements),","i. Transformations dependent on a set of specified case elements (Fig. 5, Ex. i) : These correspond to the Fillmore's examples, 'John broke the window with a hammer,' 'A Hammer broke the window,' 'The window broke'","2. Transformations caused by adverbial suffixes (Fig. 5, Ex. 2) : As shown in Ex. 2, a case suffix can be replaced by an adverbial suffix. Careful investigation reveals that a certain class of case suffixes can be replaced by an adverbial suffix without any traces (TSPI, TSP2 in Ex. 2) and another class of case suffixes cannot be, but just be follwed by an adverbial suffix (TSP3in Ex.2). In fact, a Relative ordering of case suffixes exists and higher case suffixes in the ordering can easily be replaced with an adverbial suffix without any surface traces. Moreover, this relative ordering of case suffixes depends on individual verbs, depending on how intimate a relationship the concept expressed by each noun phrase bears to the action expressed by the verb. We may be able to capture this intimacy hierarchy by setting up several different levels of connections between noun phrases and verbs, as Chomsky does in his X-theory~3)However, from computational view points, especially from recognition view points, it is convenient to mark in each surface pattern what ordering exists and which case suffixes can be replaced by which adverbial suffixes.","3.

Transformations caused by verbal complements (Fig. 5, Ex. 4) : A certain class of Japanese verbs require verbal complements, as English verbs 'promiss', 'expect', 'believe', 'want' etc. As shown in Ex. 4, certain noun phrases, which bear grammatical relationships to such verbs, should he semantically interpreted i~ relation to the verbs in the verbal complements. In the standard theory of TG, these phenomena were also treated by general transformation rules such as raising transformations.","5. Transformations in relative clauses (Fig. 5, Ex.5) : Relativization in English is atypical construction which can be adequately explained by structure dependent transformations such as wh-movement rules. However, a relativized construction in Japanese causes not only noun phrase movement but also the other surface transformations as shown in TSP4 of Ex. 5. Moreover, the noun phrases which can be moved are the phrases that are followed by particular case suffixes in the surface patterns. That is, which noun phrases can be moved is dependent on the case suffixes in the surface patterns, and, therefore, dependent on individual verbs.","6. General Transformations : Clefted constructions, for example, also appear in Japanese. Because the transformations in the above are more or less dependent on individual verbs which govern the transformed structures, we treat them by lexical rules, i.e., we assume that transformations of surface patterns have been done beforehand, and that the transformed patterns are also stored in the individual verb entries in the analysis dictionary. In the conventional approaches, there are a set of general transformational rules, which will be inversely applied in turn to input sentences, in order to obtain appropriate 'deep' structures. It has been well known that this inverse application of rules results in combinatorial prolifera-tion of possible structures, partly because such rules are not general rules and only applicable to specific classes of verbs. (consider 'promiss him to go' and 'want him to go' example). Our approach is to avoid such inverse applications of general rules. We regard most of transformation rules as word specific, and assume that pre-applied, already transformed patterns are stored in the individual verb dictionaries. The schematic view of our analysis procedure is shown in Fig. 6. During the analysis, it only Selects appropriate surface patterns (transformed or not) from the dictionary and matches them with the input sentences. You may object to us that such a configuration requires a large memory space for the dictionary. However, it is possible to reduce the dictionary size by using macro expressions, if you can classify verbs and decide which transformations are applicable to which verb classes. These macro expressions will be expand-ed when the dictionary entries containing the macros are retrieved. When you find a spcific verb behaves quite differently from others, you can specify both its surface patterns and transformed patterns directly in the dictionary without using macros. Our approach is: First, we assume that every verb is specific , and exceptional, i.e,, it has its own usages and transformed usages and, if we can find some classes of verbs which behave in the same way, then it is possible to generalize them by using macros.

That is, dictionary descriptions for them are prepared (However, because our system is an experimental prototype, the dictionary contains only about 80 verbs). The information for i, 2 and 4 is directly coded in the surface patterns. Various transformed patterns for 1 and 4 are stored in the dictionary. As for 2, information as to which one can be replaced by adverbial suffixes are indicated in each surface pattern. As for 3 and 5, each transformed patterns is accompanied with the markers that indicate when the patterns should - 417-be used (See 2-3). 2-3. Selection of Surface Patterns As described at the beginning of this chapter, the analysis proceeds in the sequence such as morphological analysis, segmentation of a sentence, recognition of relationships among sentence fragments,and finally, simple sentence and noun phrase analyses. The analysis of simple sentences, the last step, is done by pattern matchings. In this section, we will discuss how to select appropriate (transformed) surface patterns. At the second step of the analysis, the segmentation step, the input sentence is divided into several sentence fragments so that each of them contains only one predicative term. At the same time, post-verbial suffixes which follow the predicative terms are processed, and the appropriate markers of tenses, aspects, medals, and voices are selected. Moreover, if the suffixes are the ones which cause transformations, the appropriate surface patterns are selected. This selection process is performed in the way similar to Rieger's word exper parser (6) (Fig. 7)."]},{"title":"nY\\","paragraphs":["lexico lexicon *° ,"]},{"title":"iminat i .... t","paragraphs":["Irransf?r I ITransfer"]},{"title":"] fur surface-deep I.t~e voice_marker [Ithe aspect marker /","paragraphs":["mappings I?PASSlVEi"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["] I'STATIC' and | p~"]},{"title":"0","paragraphs":["line mapping s e let- l Ithe mapping selec-I If P tion marker cgmes--in l:olOn marker ~"]},{"title":"i Ito /","paragraphs":["/"]},{"title":"It.e","paragraphs":["preceding"]},{"title":"I / the","paragraphs":["preceding"]},{"title":"|","paragraphs":["[verb"]},{"title":"box~ I 1, verb","paragraphs":["box"]},{"title":"| t cumes in- 1","paragraphs":["Selected"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["Mappings of (VOICe= PASSIVE) ~ Surface to Deep.....

The global structure is represented by a tree called GPT (Global Plan Tree), whiGh guides the succeeding analyses, That is, a node of GPT indicates what kind of transformed patterns should be used to analyze the corresponding fragment, and in what oder. A certain class of transformations can be applied, whenever certain syntactic constructions are found. They do not depend on individual verbs. In relativized constructions, for example, the case suffix '~' (ga) can be optionally replaced with the other suffix '~ ' (no). (Fig. 5, TSP4 in Ex. 5). This rule is not dependent on individual verbs, and moreover, it is not dependent on deep cases. The rule is considered as 'structure dependent'. Because a GPT explicitly indicates by RC nodes where relativized constructions appear, the analysis program transforms the patterns in the dictionary into appropriate forms, when it analyzes fragments governed by a RC node, that is, if a pattern in the dictionary contains the suffix '~' (ga), the program automatically generates the transformed patterns. Such structure dependent rules are also found in sentence conjunctions, that are similar to the gapping rules in English (sentence conjunctions cannot be analyzed by the current system from the other reasons. We are now designing the procedures for sentence conjunctions). Because of space considerations we completely omitted the discussions about the noun phrase analysis, the semantic aspects of the processing, the analysis of tenses, medals, aspects and some other troublesome expressions such as adverbial modifiers in Japanese etc. The detailed discussions are found in (5). -418 3. Transfer Step The transfer is also guided by a lexicon as the analysis procedure is, -- in this case, by the bi-lingual dictionary. We will first describe the two structures over which the transfer phase bridges, ~.e. intermediate structures for Japanese and English. 3-1. Japanese Intermediate Structures--JiS Japanese intermediate structures produced by the analysis component are basically dependency structures of input sentences, based on case notions. As a usual dependency structure, each node is not labelled by a category symbol like NP, VP, PP etc., but by a word. The word attached to a node is an intermediate word which has a unique entry in the bi-lingual dictionary. It may happen that a single Japanese surface word corresponds to multiple entries in the bi-lingual dictionary. In these cases, the disambiguation among them is to be done during the analysis phase. However, it may also happen that, during the transfer phase, a single intermediate word should be mapped into several different English words. Though we claimed that nodes in a JIS was label-ed only by an intermediate word that correspond-ed to a surface Japanese word, there are some exceptions. In order to remedy computational defects of dependency structures, we introduce the other kinds of nodes which do not directly correspond to surface words, but to certain syntactic constructions in Japanese (we call such kinds of nodes 'relation descriptors'). In this sense, our JIS is a mixed form of dependency structures and phrase structures. In principle, our intermediate structures are organized in such a way that a governing node can always determine how to arrange the transferred substructures of its dependents. As will be described in 3-3, a JIS will be evaluated recursively, and the corresponding English i~termediate structure will be built up from the bottoms (See Fig. 9).

Many researchers agree that cases are useful in describing linguistic structures, especially semantics of sentences. However, no two agree with each other as to what is the complete set of cases. Our approach is very pragmatic and highly oriented to machine translation. We don't have a 'complete' set --419-- of cases in any sense. We always have only a tentative set. If we observe something wrong, we are ready to revise the current set of cases. Moreover, the definition of each case is highly dependent on individual verbs. As discussed in (4), we divide the cases into two types (this classification is also dependent on individual verbs). One is the type of cases which are intrinsic to the verb. As to the intrinsic cases, the mappings from Japanese surface to JIS relations are specified in the analysis dictionary, and moreover, the mappings from JIS relations to EIS structures are described in the bi-lingual dictionary (see Fig. ii). To put it in another way, Japanese surface structures that express these cases are mapped into corresponding English structures by the lexical rules in the two dictionaries. There are no general rules which refer to general case notions.

For this type of cases, general rules are prepared to transfer them. These rules are independently formulated of individual verbs and show how to express the deep cases in English. Therefore, in contrast to the intrinsic cases, the cases of this type are explicitly expressed by nodes in JIS's (see Fig. 12.)

English Intermediate Structure -- EIS The EIS's are similar to conventional phrase structures. The main difference is that; each node in the tree is characterized not only by a category symbol like S, NP, VP, etc., but also by a set of attribute - value pairs. EIS plays almost the same role of 'starting phrase structure' in Chomsky. Successive transformations are applied cyclically on this structure'during the English synthesis. However, the transformation component in our system includes a set of rules which are not 'structure dependent' and, there-fore, not considered as 'transformation' in TG's sense. For example, passivized constructions are generated not through transformations in Chomsky's current framework, but they are considered as base-generated. In our system, however, they should be treated during English synthesis phase, whether they are structure dependent or not. The main purpose of transformations in the English synthesis is to generate adequate English surface structures from 'Japanese-generated' structures, instead of 'base-generated' ones. Passivization transformation, for example, is indispensable in our system, because it is common in Japanese to state sentences in active voice without any agents. In order to support such transformations, information other than syntactic categories and structures is necessary. They are expressed in EIS's as a set of attribute-value pairs attached to a node. 3-3. The Transfer Procedure The general algorithm for the transfer phase changes a given JIS into the corresponding EIS by 'evaluating' the nodes in the JIS recursively. Each JIS node is labelled by an intermediate word of Japanese which has a unique entry in the bi-lingual dictionary. The description in the dictionary contains a set of transfer procedures which show how to transfer the JIS substructures whose roots are the entry word. Each trans£er procedure may be accompanied with a set of preconditions, if necessary. These preconditions are expressed by user defined LISP functions to examine the surrounding JIS as to whether the transfer procedure is appropriate or not. Some built-in LISP functions are provided to facilitate encoding these preconditions. If a JIS word has several English equivalents (i.e. it is polysemy relative to English), these preconditions are used to choose an appropriate one. Though deep semantic checking should be performed in this precondition part in more advanced systems, this part is currently used to examine certain syntactic environments or simple semantic markers. A transfer procedure usually works as follows: (i) A transfer procedure defined for a governing word (verb, relation-descriptor,etc.) will invoke the main program in order to transfer the JIS substructures governed by the current node. (2) When these substructure transfers are completed, the transfer procedure attached to the governing node will arrange the substructures (in EIS) into single structures and return them to the higher level. Because transfer procedures -420-- at the lower level generally return several possible EIS structures, the procedure at the higher level selects feasible combinations and returns them in parallel, if several combinations are feasible. (3) A transfer procedure for a dependent word (typically noun) will not invoke the main program, but only choose the appropriate English equivalents. So the recursive process terminates. Notice that the whole process is highly lexicon driven. Because the main program only checks the preconditions and invokes transfer procedures defined in the dictionary, we can easily change and augment the transfer step by adding new descriptions in the dictionary. Several standard transfer procedures are provided as shown in Table 3. Because these standard procedures are parametorized, most of Japanese intermediate words can be defined by supplying them with appropriate parameters. Fig. 13 shows an example of a verb dictionary which uses the standard procedure VBi (specified in PNAME). VBi transfers an input JIS to the EIS as shown in Fig. 13. Moreover, whenever we. recognize that a certain intermediate word requires a special treatment, we can tailor a transfer procedure applied only for that word, and put it in the dictionary. This gives us a flexible framework for dealing exceptional words that cannot be managed by general procedures.","Generated EIS Procedure Generated EIS i Procedure","VB-i The structures gov- COM-N Common nouns","VB-2 erned by verbs NOM-i NomSnalized forms",": for sentences","REL-i Type I relative QUANT-NOM quantified noun","clause phrases","REL-2 Type II relative LOC-I prepositional","(whose type) el. : phrases for","REL-3 Type III relative TIME-1 extrinsic cases","(THAT- COMP) cl.","'C0NJ-I Conjunctive eonst.

The Japanese compound word '~-- ' roughly means 'the best in Japan', and consists of two words, B Ak (Japan) and ~ (the first or one). Because the word behaves syntactically as a noun, the analysis procedure treats it as a usual noun. As usual nouns in Japanese, it can be used as a noun modifier.","Fthe most beautifug (a) ~$--~/~ > [girl in Japan J a single noun which means 'the best in Japan' a single noun which means 'beautiful girl' the same a single noun as above which means","'runner' the best runner in Japan ] The above two phrases are simply represented in JIS's as shown in Fig. 14.

It embeds the modified noun (or noun phrase) in the parametorized EIS structure as shown in Fig. 14-(3). Notice that both the superlative transformation and the 'the' attachment to the superlative adjective will be done at the last step of the English synthesis phase. 4. English SynthesiE Because an EIS is generated directly from the corresponding JIS, it preserves many characteristics of Japanese syntax. In this sense, it is 'Japanese-generated' but not 'base-generated'. We should transform this structure to obtain a correct English syntactic structure. Japanese 'wh'-questions, for example, are stated in the forms similar to their declarative ones, except that wh-words are marked by special prefix words. The wh-movement rule is undoubtedly necessary to produce correct English sentences. Moreover, though passivization is not considered as a transformation from Lexicalists' point of view, it is indispensable in our system. Therefore, much information other than structural matching is necessary to determine whether the transformation rule is applicable or not. 4-1. The Generation Dictionary At the first step of the generation, the system retrieves the lexical description of each word in the EIS from the generation dictionary. The generation dictionary contains information such as shown in Table 4. It contains not only trivial indicators necessary for morphological synthesis, but also some other indicators which are examined during the transformation process. marker meaning UN- Verbs which can not PASSIVE be used in passive STATE Verbs whose aspectual","feature are tSTATE t 'UNC V-ADV Adverbs mostly used TOU","as verb modifiers S-ADV Adverbs mostly used","as sentence modifiers VP-TOP Adverbs usually pre- ~'~S","icedinR the verbs S-TOP S-ADV adverbs which INF","usually appears at","Jthe beginning of sent.l marker S-AFT UNCOUNT TOUGH PROPER AN","~DSn~ S-ADV adverbs which usually appears at the end ol sentences Uncountable nouns Tough adjectives Proper nouns The words that begin with vowels The last characters Of the words are 'ses'~etc The words which has irregular inflection forms Table 4 Markers in the Synthesis Dictionary 4-2. Transformation Rule A transformation rule is represented in our system by a 9-tuple as shown in Fig. 15. A transformation rule is essentially a tree-to-tree mapping expressed by MP ->CP. Each rule is specified as either OB or OP. OB means that the rule is obligatory; if the rule is applicable, it should be applied. If a rule is marked as OP(tional), it may or may not be applied. At present, when an applicable optional rule is encountered, two alternative Structures with equal feasibilities will be generated.

Fig. 15 Format of a Transformation Rule the most appropriate one would require, certain stylistic considerations, which is beyond our current scope. The applicability of a rule is checked not only by pattern-matching but also by user-defined checking procedures specified in BPL. Because an MP contains several variables and the pattern-matching between MP and the current Free structural binds the variables to appropriate substructures, these user-defined procedures can investigate the relationships between substructures in arbitrary ways, including attribute checkings, by utilizing this variable binding. The whole algorithm works cyclically from bottom to top, as usual transformations. According to the rule map as illustrated in Fig. 16, transformation rules are applied to every cyclic node (VP, NP, S) at the lowest in a tree, then at one level higher, and so on."]},{"title":"I' I","paragraphs":["Check wheteher Check whether SUBJ is nat the S is in a specified THAT-COMP"]},{"title":"~ OB 9B","paragraphs":["INO-SUBJ-CHECK~-- -~NO-SUBJ-MANIPULATION]"]},{"title":"~heck ~hether\\\\ [ J","paragraphs":["the modality \\X | / is 'POSSIBLE' \\","~"]},{"title":"~ ~ ~ ~B ' N~","paragraphs":["OB","|OPTIONAL-PASSIVE] [IT-POSSIBLES [OB-PASSIVE-NO-SUBJ I IREALIZATIONI \" /I\" I"]},{"title":"|","paragraphs":["IOB-PAS S IVE~ ~"]},{"title":"Z","paragraphs":["|S-WH-MOVEMENT~ I If the rule succeeds","....

No special comments would be necessary for this phase. 5. Concluding Remarks Fig. 17. shows some examples of translation which illustrate the current abilities of the system. As these examples show, the system can translate fairly complex sentences, though several problems still remain unsolved. The distinction between definite and indefinite noun phrases, for example, cannot be made by the current system, because no fixed expressions to distinguish them exist in Japanese surface sentences. Therefore, neither definite nor indefinite articles are not attached to the English noun phrases. Another problem is to supply appropriate elements from context for omitted expressions. Especially, case elements in a sentence are frequently omitted in Japanese, when they are easy to recognize from the context. Though the current system tries to find appropriate surface English words and structures at the English synthesis phase which do not require the omitted elements, it would be inevit-able to incorporate contextual processings. The current system works very well as an experimental prototype. Following to the same basic principles with the current system, we are now designing a new and more advanced ~--~ system, in which these (i) Input Japanese ~ 0 ~ ~ ,~ defects of the current system will be improved. Our basic contention in this paper is that most of linguistic phenomena should be treated by understanding systems, including the authors,emphasized too much the importance of pragmatic knowledge. However, one of the recent trends in this area, which we also support, is to lay more emphasis on the importance of syntactic processings, or at least, syntactic structures of sentences. This attitude is, we believe, especially important for MT systems. The various transformed syntactic structures described in section 2 have been overlooked by the researchers of computational linguistics so far. We hope that our approach, the lexicon based analysis procedure, provides an appropriate framework to integrate syntactic structures and operations with the other kinds of processings such as semantic and pragmatic ones.","References (1)W.Hutchins : Machine Translation and Machine-Aided Translation, Jour. of Doc., 1978 (2)J.Bresnan : Realistic Transformational Grammar, in Linguistic Theory and Psychological Reality, MIT Press, 1979 (3)N.Chomsky : On Wh-movement, in Formal Syntax, Academic Press, 1977 (4)M.Nagao et.al.: Analysis of Japanese Sentences by Using Sementic and Contextual Information, AJCL, Microfiche 41, 1976 (5)K.Mitamura : Japanese Analysis for a MT system, MS Thesis, Kyoto Univ., 1980 (in Japanese) (6)C.Rieger : Word Expert Parsing, in Proc. of the 6 th IJCAI, Tokyo, 1979 (7)R.
