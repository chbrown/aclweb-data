A system should be selected which does not only fit theoretically but also can be practically 6 applied, due to its \"natural\" character. It represents a difficult task to cut away a usable model thesaurus from the huge meaning treasure of natural langu-","s age. Air Traffic Control Language, restricted to Ground Control, serves this purpose. Due to severe realtime requirement~ a limitation to conventional com-","II/12113 puters has been avoideo. Exclusively","3110 content analoguous memory structures guarantee an automatic answer search, which obeys the realtime obligations of 4-6 syllables/s speech veloscity and 0.5-1.5 s response interval.

These alerts are triggered by the user's action. The introduced \"Standard 80\" thesaurus meets these demands. It concerns ground and ramp control activities in ATCL dialogs between pilots and air controllers. In those Air ~raffic ~ontrol Language dialogs taxy procedures by the user, in this case the pilot, are in addition monitored by sensors at the apron. Thus, besides \"primary inputs\" by pilot utterances also \"secondary inputs\" by the system help the content guided answer search mechanism. The ATCL at international airports has been reduced to one --559-- particular language English - already in the fifties. In a minimum of time elapse a maximum of information flux between the dialog partners is needed.This postulate causes all grammatical components with a low level efficiency rate to be abolished naturally. Considering most recent structural evaluations, formalization results of natural","6 language led to the determination of : \"key features of content; KFCs~I~y~ ~ a matching procedure of input KFCs with twin KFCs stored in a ROM, prepared answers can be triggered. But, a match instruction can be also used to trigger a sequence of deuter, which are implemented in a time-analoguous read-only array.The trigger procedure of deuter sequences is faster than that of prepared answers. Especially if more voluminous thesauri are used But, up to the present, an actualizing of deuter sequences is still missing proper morphological agglutinations. Automatically triggered deuter sequences appear in isolated morphologies. For this purpose an \"algorithm of pro-","G gressive agglutination\" is under consideration, by which syntax particles and additional syntax rules can be mingled into deuter sequences. For the ATCL however deuter sequences without too many syntagms are quite sufficient. 2 \"STANDARD 80\" A MODEL THESAURUS 2.1 Alphabetical Sequence 100 meanings = 82 deuter plus 18 syntax particles, ATCL, Ground Control, 121.9 Mc, Stuttgart International Airport: in alphabetical order, syntax particles underlined: affirmative, airborne frequency, altimeter setting, approved, apron, 6 Armycopter, backtrack, behind, 9 brake maifunc-tion, calling, call sign, caution, center line, Cessna 172, change to 118.8, charlie, circle/circling, clearance, cleared to, construction work, contact radar 125. 05, contact tower 118.8, continue, correct, 25 crossing, D-EIPV, departing, departure route 28, exit point, expect level change en route, 31 expedite, fire truck, flight level, follow, follome, 36 for, go ahead, 38 goodbye, Hamburg airport, helicopter, 41 hover, information, 43 intersection, level change en route, Lima, local flight, Lufthansa Boing, 48 Lufthansa 792, maintain, military aircraft 50, next, 52 November departure, on grass, 125.05, opposite direction,out, outbound, 58 over, Pan Am Clipper, parking area, permission, please, position, 64 present, QNH 1019 mb, 66 QNH 1009 mb, radar 125.05, ramp, ready to, readback, refueling, request, ro_r_o_~_e~_, runway 26, 75 runway 08, say again, slow down, special VFR, standby, start up clearance, start up engines, stay clear off, stop, 84 Stuttgart Tower, takeoff, taxy clearance, taxy/taxying, this is, to the West, 90 type of aircraft, 91 via departure route, wait, we are, what, when airborne call radar 125.05, when ready, wilco, 98 wind, 99 you are, I00 0493 PA.

Among all cycles of the same age, frequency values and redundancies of single deuter are checked.

Not only twin-KFCs but all potential deuter in all dialogs are stored in the DSS-Logic. This, in a way, substitutes the Answer Pool for prepared answers. The read only memory implementation must be in geometric \"time logic\". Thus an electrical activation of one matched twin-KFC triggeres a sequence of surrounding stored deuter. This triggering is executed by a \"switsch thru-\", a \"put through connec-tion\" procedure. Each actualized deuter in such a \"switch thru sequence\" is simultaneously transformed into an audio output, a synchronous \"read out\" The \"switch thru association\" becomes \"loud thinking\". This fits a logic answer to the input-KFCs. Major functions of the DSS are: I) All twin-KFCs serve potential match","procedures with input-KFCs. 2) After an input-KFC is matched, the","matched twin-KFC is activated as \"the first deuter\" in a triggered deuter sequence. 3) The length of the sequence will be","limited from 3 to I0 deuter. 4) Each connected deuter in a triggered","deuter sequence is allocated with 2-3","seconds time, in which the adequate","English utterance can be expressed by","a speech synthesizer device. 5) The \"switch thru connection\" to neigh-","bouring deuter in the deuter sequence","continues only, after the English","word of the last deuter is spoken out. 6.2 Architecture of a DSS The array of DSS content is divided into dialog cycle sections. For each of them five or more KFC-Match/Trigger Stations (Mattrigs) are provided. Structure and organization of function units in all first dialog cycles of the eight model dialogs are shown in Fig. 4: If such sections for the remaining dialog cycles 2-6 of all potential dialogs are compi-led in an analoguous way and put together, a further elimination of redundant portions will help to create a complex DSS architecture.

More than expected, complex evaluations of nat. lang. phenomena were necessary for memory array purposes. Among them particularly the six deuter-criteria. But also a sufficient familiarity with the applied thesaurus was necessary. Since 16 years the author holds a valid PPI license and executes active flying.
