Abstract Story-processing systems have to deal, or avoid dealing, with INFERENCE CONTROL ''6' Ii, 13. when designing one such system 2, we were great-ly helped by the \"(ERC)RC\" expression for connotation I. Our system is specialised in multi - faceted descriptions of characters (not, how-ever, in the most difficult problems of beliefs about beliefs 4 and 8): here we present another aspect of the story character processing, name-ly the recursive EXPLANATION of inconsistencies appearing in the description of a character. We give a very schematic system overview, then some details about the CONNOTATION rules and an example of their application to a story. posed to (\"fromage\" RC(\"cheese\")) RC(\"french\"), but also situation-specific ones, as (\"cheese\" RC(\"cheese as geological stuff\") RC(\"bizarre\"), in the processing of a robot who asked what the moon is made of. As Barthes then remarks, connotations may be based on a set of initial expressions rather than on a single one, which is expressed by (EiRCl, E2RC 2 ..... EnRCn) R C This seems to be an essential feature of connotations, since it allows emphasis on 'connoted' contents by means of an accumulation of signifiers. Another feature, elegantly illustrated in 'l'envers des signes 'i0 by the two steps ((\"voile\" RC(\"navire\"))RC(\"po~sie\"))RC(\"rh~to-rique\"), is their recursivity. Introduction The allusiveness of human languages, in addition to being quite convenient in social life, justifies the use of variable amounts of i n t e 1 - 1 i g e n c e in processing a sentencer according to the number of reasoning steps leading to a position where a satisfactory reaction be-",",14 comes possible, like \"to redefine 'substance when reading Spinoza\". Let us represent a first step by \"ERC\" i.e. \"an expression is related to a content ''1, which Barthes calls the denotation: the second reasoning step will be represented in the connotation formula: \" (ERC) RC\". It does not determine exactly where the reasoning step leads to: if we write E's content as C(E), we may have quite general connotations like (\"cheese\"RC(\"cheese\"))RC(\"english\") as op-As a beginning we made an attempt to express this in AI terms by writing a program, BAQUIL, which finds the connotations with structure(E I RCi, E2RC2)RC in a recursive way. The interest of such connotations can be shown by15: .a doctor asks:\"how is he feeling ?\" .the nurse answers:\"he is groaning.\" where the nurse means, by connotation,that the patient is suffering: (\"groaning\" RC(\"groaning\") RC(\"suffering)), but our understanding is directed by the previous interrogation, so that the definitive result we expect from our system will be (\"feeling\"RC(\"feeling\"), \"groaning\"RC(\"groaning\") )RC(\"suffering\"). This result shall be reached by consulting a semantic network and observing that 'groaning' is not exactly a case of 'feeling', but an expression of it. Thus \" the nurse means he is suffering\" is both a connotation and an inference, and seemingly a useful one: compare with Charniak's 6 \"demon-demon in-228 teraction, 'want to buy candies' and 'shake piggy-bank' together trigger 'need money'; but BAQUIL has no such extended world-knowledge. It is specialised in DISCOURSE ATTITUDES like 'errors', 'lies', 'jokes' etc. This also means it can run without an elaborate model 5 of personalities, and so deal with fables and folktales about foxes and sparrows, which would perhaps fail to have goals 'common to most people', although they are meant as human in a way. System overview Before explaining how it works, we give an idea of BAQUIL's construction (i.e. its hierarchy)."]},{"title":"/ \"., / INPUT / HAlt 14, ~,. j,~ ,, ,. ,, o u'rP~JT ¢~/Al~Acr~l~,V'-\" \\ ~ ~-scmrr'lo~ \\ ou~vr","paragraphs":["--229-- Schema.tic explanation of how the system runs","i) the dictionary input procedure builds, from a file whose structure is shown in the ' sample session ', a classical semantic network 7'9\"''","2) the story specialist submits sentences to a parser 12 and the resulting case structures to the story character specialist, whose actions include the c o m p a r i s o n s and i n f e r e n c e s detailed here.","3) output procedures express the inferences in English and, on request, detail the representation of each character in the story. Metarules of BAQUIL (this page and the following three will develop what rules are applied by the story character specialist: this includes METARULES, RULES OF COMPARISON and INFERENCE RULES.)","MI BAQUIL starts a connotation or inference only when a comparison rule has been applied to a pair of predicates which are related to the set of descriptors of one character: the predicates are versions of the semantic case structure in terms of the current character description, and are called 'NOTATIONS'","M2 Except when specified otherwise (inference rules R6, R7), the inference is expressed by a 'notation' whose verb is a subcategory of either CHANGE or INCONSISTENCY. consistency. The metarules are represented in BAQUIL by instructions: Mi in the NOTATION procedure, M2 and M3 in the CONNOTATION procedure. The latter also contain the instruction corresponding to the inference rules, while the comparison rules form the comparison procedure. Discussion of the metarules M1expresses the hypothesis that many interesting antinomies can be detected during the pairwise matching of predicates concerning one story character.\" M2 aims to expres a more or less syntactic finding about the description of a character (co-presence of two antinomic 'notations') in terms of the 'notations' themselves. M3 means \"use the lexical taxonomy when trying to recognize a situation\"; as a result it in-troduce a distinction between natural languages, for the subcategories of (for instance) \"inconsistency\" are not the same in different dictionariesl Consider French and English, \"error\" and \"mistake\" vs. \"erreur\" and \"m@rise\", or worse: the two cases of \"to tell a lie\" in Russian, i.e. \"vrat'\" vs. \"l'gat'\". Still it is perhaps acceptable to allow for important pragmatic divergences between languages (and, indeed, dialects or sociolects.) Moreover, we did not represent the vocabulary of other languages than French and English in our system, so we lack precisions about how \"whorfian\" it would turn out.","M3 Those subcategories are examined in the dictionary order and the first one which permits the application of an inference rule is selected. To sum up: (M1) comparison and then inference about (M3) subcat(gories of (M2) change or in-Although a similar discussion of the comparison and inference rules would be necessary, we will simply present them here along with some examples. The examples are taken from a set of 20 stories (4 to 200 sentences)which were dealt with by the system at Essex in 1979-1980. --230-- Compari son rules Exagpl e s. Their object is to tell whether an inference must be started, or not.","C1 the predicates differ only by a negation in one of them (i.e. same environment, verb etc. and none was inferred.) C1 Confucius is handsome, Confucius is not hand-some (in which case 'handsome' need not be a priori present in the lexicon.).","C2 similar to C1 but there is a hyponymy between the verbs. C2 Confucius is horrible, Confucius is not ugly. C3 lexical exclusion between the verbs of two affirmative predicates. C4 transgression of lexical interdiction, or lexical necessity ignored. C5 C1, C2 or C3 applies and the first predicate expresses an inference. C3 Confucius is rich, Confucius is broke.","C4 Confucius is human and flies away.","(interdiction)","Confucius flies away, he does not exist.","(necessity)","C5 the systeminferred Confucius is lying, the story reveals he is joking (like C3).

(this occurs after a C5 situation led to the application of the relevant inference rule. )","C6 in the situation above, Lao-tsu says that Confucius is lying BEFORE the story disconfirms it. C7 Lao-tsu's remark comes AFTER the revision of the inference. The predicate or 'notation' structure, which permits the comparison, is","(affirmat.-or-neg., case frame, char. descr.) and the connotation has the same structure augmented by reference to premises ( 2, 3 or a list of pairs if an inference has been confirmed.) The lexicon element has following slots in its structure: (list of subcategories, are-they-mutually-exclusive-or-not, supercategory, property list) and the property list contain references to other lexical elements. --231-Connotation rules: exam~es As the rules by themselves do not suggest the situations which make them useful, let's have some examples first.","RI ...the servant said: \"that cow is not going to eat you.\" (...)

R3 and R5, which connect the inference with a previously observed detail, are \"causality\" rules: in addition to references to the two premises whose comparison started it, the inference has one reference to the predicate that justified the choice of a more precise verb like 'fiction' or 'joke'. A difficulty (which we provisionnally avoided) is that some lexical connections could represent 'necessary truths' that are just sometimes true, as \"teachers are sometimes igorant\"; what R5 should do with them is not clear. However, if one considers folktales and fables, the diction 2 nary connection one uses are almost always \"foxes are sly, full stop\" so the question does not arise.","R5 (continuation of example for R3) the teacher answers that there is no cheese either. .INFERENCE ABOUT AN INCONSISTENCY; USING THE LEXICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN 'Krylov' AND 'author', AND ONE FROM 'author' TO 'fiction', BAQUIL SELECTS THE LATTER SUBCATEGORY OF INCONSISTENCY. A difficulty for R3 is that a 'topic' could be connected both to 'religious discourse' and 'joke', so in the present state of the system one of the connections would be systematically ignored: but for the time being, there are very few lexical connections, the reason being that we cannot decide which necessary truths really belong in a lexicon. While the other rules exploit comparisons be-232 - BAQUIL's connotation rules 'references' are the two initial premises of the inference; 'hypotheses come from the list of subcategories of the initial verb, i.e. the different cases of 'change' or 'inconsistency' as represented in the lexicon.","R1 if both references are about the same character descriptor, the inference is also about that descriptor. (this allows for stories inside the story).","R2 if the inference's verb is not yet specified and the inference is about the descriptor of the second reference, BAQUIL tries the cases of 'change'. Rules R6 and R7 are illustrated by the story of the vegetarian wolf: given a dictionary which connects 'wolf' to 'bad action', hence to 'lie', the system first infers from the beginning of the story, where the wolf is contradicted by someone, that it lies; later, the story-telling warns the reader about it, telling explicitly that it does not. The inference is NOT erased, but earmarked as fallacious; so R7 applies when a character says: this wolf is lying; but, if the story had not denied the possibility of a lie, R6 would have applied. One can see that R6, R7 and R8 are not quite satisfying. I suspect them of being in need of some refinement. The set of situations 'clever character or lucky guess or etc.' is not clearly defined, and I do not know what to do with the Liar's Paradox.","R3 if the verb of a hypothesis is connected to the name of the character in a reference by a 'be about' link, the hypothesis is selected. On the contrary, R3 and R5 give less trouble.
