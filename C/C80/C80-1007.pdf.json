I present here a method that allows one to construct a CF grammar of a natural language that correctly accounts for verbal selection rules. This goes contrary to the prevail-ing opinion, following Chomsky 5, that such a construction is impossible. My method consists essentially in separating the semantic function of a selection rule, namely, the exclusion of certain noun sub-classes, from the syntactic relation between the elements (verb, subject, object:) linked by this relation of selection. When the verb and object (subject) are separated by intervening levels of complement construction, the selection can still be satisfied by a double classification of verbs: according to the kind of subject they take, and also according to the type of verb that can follow them (in the complement construction).

This opinion was first advanced by Chomsky 5 who discussed this problem from the point of view of phrase structure grammars. He presents there a fragment of a CF phrase structure grammar in terms of noun phrases NP, verb phrases, VP, etc., which are familiar from immediate constituent analysis. These rules cannot treat verbal selection rules properly; Chomsky ~ (ch. 8) had already tried himself to correct this defect within the framework of a CF phrase structure grammar, but the difficulties he encountered seem to have persuaded him that only a transformational grammar could handle such a problem.","Harman 13 proposed another solution to the problem of treating verbal selection rules in a CF grammar; he added a set of subscripts to the CF rules used in Chomsky 5, which were chosen so that only those subjects and objects which satisfied the selection rules could appear with a given type of verb.

However, it turns out that this question is not so easily disposed of as it would appear, and recent work by Joshi & Levy 18 shows that a CS grammar containing rich context-dependent rules can be used to analyze trees that describe a CF language. They did this by an extension of a theorem of Peters & Ritchie 21 , who showed that CS rules of a certain type can be used not to generate sentences, i.e., not to characterize them, but only to verify their well-formedness, by applying the context-dependent parts of these rules as constraints on the set of trees that schematize these sentences. In this case, the language described by these trees is a CF language.","Joshi & Levy generalized the kinds of CS rules that can be used for this result and defined CS rules that can describe conditions on the context whose action is close to that of certain transformations. These rules are expressed as Boolean combinations of predicates that describe the left and/or right context of a node, or the upper and/or lower contexts (the nodes above and below a given node). Roughly speaking, a tree is said to be analyzable with respect to a grammar containing such rules if one of the rules is satisfied at each node of the tree. In that case, the language which consists of the terminal strings of all the trees analyzed by the grammar is a CF language, even though the rules take the context into account ~. Hence these terminal strings can be described by","§Note that the formalism used by Joshi & Levy for displaying conditions on trees is close to the notation used for rewrite rules, and can lead to some confusion, lit need only be remembered that these context-dependent rules are not used to generate structures. 38 some CF language.","Now the string grammar proposed by Harris 15 and which analyzes English (Sager 23) and French (Salkoff 2~'25) can be shown to be of just the form described by Joshi & Levy. It contains CS rules of the type described by them, and is used to analyze a tree, rather than to generate it. It would thus appear that English or French can be described by some CF language, although the string grammar gives no clear clue as to what its form would be. I shall show here that such a CF grammar can be written for French, and that it can treat, in a linguistically appropriate fashion, the problem of the expression of verbal selection rules in nested complement constructions. I have chosen French because systematic data giving a wide coverage of the French lexicon are available (Gross 12, Boons et al.3); however, the very nature of this construction makes quite plausible its extension to other natural languages. Only the method used will be outlined in this brief article, and an example of its application to embedded complement constructions; for more details, consult Salkoff 25 (chap. 3)","I now construct CF rules that correctly describe sentences in which related pairs like verb-subject, verb-object, etc., that are linked by a relation of selection, may be separated by constructions of unbounded length. Each such CF rule is the expansion of a sentence schema S. The verbal selection rules are accounted for in this method by separating the semantic function of a selection rule, namely, the exclusion of certain noun sub-classes, from the syntactic relation between the pairs carrying this function (generally, a verb and a noun phrase). Each selection rule is decomposed into two independent parts: one part is the choice of a noun not classified in certain noun sub-classes, in such a way as to express the semantics of that selection rule; the second part is the use of the noun phrase containing this N for the subject or object of a given verb in ~ rule schema, which amounts to satisfying the complete verbal selection rule.","Conjunctional sequences, including sentences containing respectivement can be handled by this method, but not within the strict mathematical framework of a CF language. The resulting CF grammar of French can be compared with a transformational grammar, and it is seen that the two are more similar than has been thought. §|.

The sentence schema for S 1 is a sentence de-formation (in Harris '17 terminology); there are about ten such deformations in French. Another one is the following:","(5) S + NP t V32 S 3 (Max apprend ... s","S 3 ÷ ~ .

It is marked by the same selectional features as oNPs and will be used to 'transmit' this selection through embedded sentences. Such dummy elements come close to certain pronouns found in relative clauses without antecedent, like ce in: J'ai achet$ ce que Max a sculpt@. A second type of relative clause is this:","(7) NP r2 ÷ NP que S (le livre que...","o pro Spr ° ÷ NP s t V 2 (~)o ...

Selection Rules","According to the kind of noun allowed as subject, or as direct or indirect object, a verb is said to select for that sub-class• The majority of the selection rules thus concern the following three rules for S: (8)a S ÷ NP s t V 2 NP ° (Luc porte un chapeau)","b S + NP t V 3 P. NP, (Max d~pend de Luc) S 1 iO","c S ÷ NP t V 4 NP P. NP, (Max attribue S O i iO","la m~daille d S~c) The selection rules vary with the preposition Pi for verbs V 3 and V~. In the sentence analyzer based on the string grammar, these selection rules are contained in a system of contextual rules attached to each lexical entry for a verb that can appear in (8)• Experience shows that five noun sub-classes are needed for such a system of selection rules: N t, 'time'; Ns, sentential; Nh, 'human'; Nc, concrete; and Nnom, nominalizations. These sub-classes are used in the verbal entries to indicate the unacceptable contexts for a verb classified in V2, V3, or V~. The analyzer then uses these contextual rules to disallow an unacceptable decomposition in a sentence analysis.","These contextual rules can be replaced by CF rules in the following way. Let","(9) N \\ {N. + N. + ...} = N\"","i ] denote any noun except one belonging to sub-class Ni, or to N~, etc.; the bar \\ means 'min-us'. If N\" is substituted for the noun N in any NP, and carried over into every rule developing NP, the terminal rule for the noun in NP will be (]0) N\" ÷ N d , where N d is a lexical entry. Each choice for N d is compared with the list of sub-classes Ni,N., ..., attached to N'. If N d belongs to any ~f these sub-classes, it is discarded; if N d doesn't belong to these sub-classes the conditions expressed in (9) are satisfied. Now, if the selection rule of a given verb is that sub-classes N., N~, , are unacceptable as","i d \"'\" subject (object), then the noun phrase containing N d satisfies that selection rule, and will be the only noun phrase permitted in that syntactic position.","I now define noun phrases GN containing all the combinations of excluded noun classes from the five named above (there are 31 such GN): (l|)a GN + N, if no sub-classes are excluded; b GNi ÷ N\\{Nt}; GN2 ÷ N\\{Ns}; ... ; GN 5 ÷ N\\{Nno m} ; c GNi, 2 ÷ N\\{N t + Ns};GNi, 3 ÷ N\\{N t + N h} • ..GNI,5 + N\\{N t + Nnom}; 40 GN2,z ÷ N\\{N + Nh}; ... S Inserting the noun phrases GN~ { into (8), and replacing the subscripts i an~J]_ ' by the single subscript ~, I obtain the following rule schemata:","(12) S ÷ (GNj) s t Vj,j, (GNj,) ° ; I_<j,j'_<31 S ÷ (GNj) s t V.,j,,j Pi (GNj,,)io I~j,j\"_<31 S ÷ (GNj) s t Vj, m (GNj,) ° Pi (GNj\")io 1_<ms (j 'xj\"xk) The subscripts are not independent; in general, a verb accepts a certain GNj, (GN:,,) only for","•",".","•","J",". certain values of GNj. This is captured in the double verb classification: V~ ~,(Vj,~,,) is that verb sub-class which requiresJ'JGNi Jfor subject, when the direct (indirect) object is GN i, (GN i ). Lexicographlcal work shows that there are'about 40 different prepositions appearing in the objects P N and N P N. Since the double verb classification must be carried out for each value of Pi' this amounts to a triple classification of verbs. §3. Elimination of the complex symbols","The schema (12) generates only acceptable sentences; each verb in the lexicon is classified according to which of the sub-classes defined by (12) it belongs to; hence no verb will ever appear in a schema of type (12) unless it is acceptable there. Then, since the process defined by (I0) is such that only acceptable nouns can be chosen for the noun phrases GN (= N') in these schemata, each schema must in fact give rise to an acceptable sentence•","The situation is quite different, however, for the rules containing oNPs, NP o or NPio. These cannot be developed as written, for two reasons: (1) only noun phrases of the type N\" are available, so that verbal selection rules can be satisfied; (2) the syntactic functions expressed by the subscripts on these noun phrases can be obtained only by a sub-classification of the verbs appearing with them. Thus, in order for oNPs (in 4) to be an acceptable object of the verb V a that precedes, and also an acceptable subject for the verb V b of the embedded sentence containing it, the verb V b must be sub-classified according to type of subject, and V a has to be sub-classified according to the type of V b that may follow.","An even more complex classification is needed to handle relative clauses like (7), which begin with NP o. This noun phrase must be an acceptable object for the last verb, say Vc, in the S which follows; however, S can contain an pro pro unbounded number of embedded verbs before V c appears. Hence, V c is not known at the moment when the lexical entry is chosen for the N\" which represents NP o. The problem, then, is to 'transmit' the selectional characteristics of the noun in NP o to the rule that will later develop Ve, by using the embedded verbs as carriers for the selectional information• This transmission of selectional information necessitates a sub-classification both of embedded verbs and of the schemata of the type S","pro\" §31 Elimination of oNPs","I subdivide the sets S]S 2, S 3, ...

The CF grammar I have proposed contains the information that establishes relationships between sentences, but it does not contain the operations or the metalinguistic assertions that make the transformation explicit. By a small extension of the CF framework I can also obtain the equivalent of a transformation, as follows. As an example, I consider the passive transformation.","The passive transformation consists in matching an active phrase with its passive counterpart. The statement of the transformation can stop there, as does Harris 'I~, or one can add the specification of the computer operations needed to create the active and passive trees, as in generative grammar.

It was just to avoid this kind of useless duplication that justified the introduction of transformations. Suppose now that I factorize the selection rules from a set of forms that constitute an equivalence class, for example, from the 'active' and the 'passive' forms; I place a separator p between the forms of the equivalence class: (29) S ÷ NP s t V 2 NPo/p/ NP o t"]},{"title":"~tre","paragraphs":["V2~"]},{"title":"(par","paragraphs":["NPs)/p/"]},{"title":"I1 t ~tre","paragraphs":["V2e NP o"]},{"title":"(par","paragraphs":["NPs);","+ N~ \" NP o + N] NP s In this formulation, the selection rules are no longer duplicated; moreover, we can interpret the separator p between the members of the equivalence class as indicating a relation between the sentence schemas so separated. The factorization of the selection rules, together with the introduction of the separator can be read as the definition of a transformational rule between the sentence schemata.","Of course, rule (29) is no longer CF, but it represents a rather natural extension of the CF framework which makes the latter much more similar to a transformational grammar than one might have thought possible up til now. However, the reader will note that the concept of a transformation is indispensable as a tool for the construction of this CF grammar, and then for its extension towards a transformational grammar by means of the factorization of selection rules. Furthermore, this CF grammar does not generate the sentences of the language 'weakly', in the meaning given this word by Chomsky; in fact, it provides them an 'adequate' grammatical structure as well as a linguistically justifiable relation-ship to other sentences of the language.","Finally, let us note that although the entire set of rules of the CF grammar proposed here is large (of the order of 109 rules), it is nonetheless finite. Furthermore, the size of the grammar is of no theoretical consequence, since it could be stored quite handily, not in some static memory (e.g., a pile of discs), but in a dynamic form (that is, in the form of schemata) where each rule is generated at the moment when the program of syntactic analysis (or generation) requires it. In this way, the set of rules would be reduced to a series of sub-programs that can generate either one rule, or a sub-set of rules, or all the rules. During analysis or generation, a call for rules would activate their"]},{"title":"synthesis","paragraphs":["by the appropriate sub-program.","Such a program of analysis by synthesis reduces the number of rules to a smaller number of sub-programs, but a string grammar reduces them still more, down to a set of about 150 strings (the rewrite rules) together with about 200 restrictions (the CS portions attached to the CF rules).","The size of the CF grammar required to describe selection rules adequately also explains why all attempts at automatic syntactic analysis by means of strictly CF grammars undertaken until now have failed. The authors of these CF grammars limited their effort to including some rudimentary linguistic facts; the average size of this sort of CF grammar was of the order of several thousand rules (cf. Kunolg,20). Under these conditions, there was no question of providing only linguistically acceptable analyses. However, in the last few years, other CS variants of a CF grammar have been proposed, and partly worked out. In particular, the augmented transition network grammar of Bobrow & Fraser 2, especially in the form given it by Woods 28, has predicates associated with the transitions, predicates that are so many context-sensitive tests. This kind of 44-grammar is then quite similar to string grammar, i.e., to a CF grammar together with CS conditions on the rules. Unfortunately, none of the grammars based on the ideas of Bobrow and Woods has been worked out in sufficient detail to make a linguistic comparison with string grammar possible. BIBLIOGRAPHY I.
