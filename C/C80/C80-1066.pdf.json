NEDOBEJKINE GETA, UNIVERSITY OF GRENOBLE F-38041GRENOBLE-CEDEX 53 Introduction","The original version of this paper is very detailed. Space limitations for publication in COLING's proceedings have forced us to reduce it by a factor of five. The more detailed version has been proposed for publication in '~inguistics\".","This paper is an attempt to present the computer models and linguistic strategies used in the current version of the Russian-French translation system developed at GETA, within the framework of several other applications which are developed in a parallel way, using the same computer system. This computer system, called ARIANE-78, offers to linguists not trained in programming an interactive environment, together with specialized metalanguages in which they write linguistic data and procedures (essentially, dictionaries and grammars) used to build translation systems. In ARIANE-78, translation of a text occurs in six steps : morphological analysis, multilevel analysis, lexical transfer, structural transfer, syntactic generation, morphological generation. To each such step corresponds a computer model (non-deterministic finite-state string to tree transducer, tree to tree transducer,...), a metalanguage, a compiler and execution programs. The units of translation are not sentences, but rather one or several paragraphs, so that the context usable, for instance to resolve anaphores, is larger than in other second-generation systems.","As ARIANE-78 is independent of any particular application, we begin by presenting its main features in Part I. Some of them are standard in second-generation systems, while others are original. Among these, we insist on the multilingual aspect of the system, which is quite unique, on the very powerful control structures embodied in the supported computer models (non-determinism, parallelism, heuristic programming), and on its interactive data-base aspect.","In the second and larger part, we successively describe each step of this Russian-French application. We first present the underlying computer model (there are 4 of them, as the second, third and fourth step use the same one), then the organization of the linguistic data. A small text is used throughout the text as a standard example. Examples of translations of larger texts appear at the end. I - Current GETA translation system","The computer system ARIANE-78, together with appropriate linguistic data, constitutes a multilingual automatized translation system.","The system is a rathersophisticated second generation system. It relies on classical as well as more original principles. I.

This target structural descriptor is then transformed into the output text by the generation phase. Essential in our concePtion is the fact that analysis is performed independently of the target language(s). The \"deeper\" the analysis, the shorter the distance between the two structural descriptors. Ideally, one could imagine a \"pivotal\" level, at which they would be the same.","In the past, Pr. Vauquois' team tried a slightly less ambitious possibility [Vauquois, 1975], namely to use an \"hybrid\" (Shaumjan) pivot language, where the lexical units are taken from a natural language, so that the transfer phase is reduced to a lexical transfer, without any structural change. As it is not always possible, or even desirable, to reach this very abstract level, one may choose not to go all the way up the mountain and to stop some-where in the middle. This is why we call our structural descriptors"]},{"title":"\"i~termediate structures\".","paragraphs":["Note that ARIANE-78 imposes nothing of that kind, both extremes are still possible, and in fact the linguistic teams have agreed on \"multilevel\" intermediate structures which contain very deep as well as low level types of information, ranging from logical relations to traces (see details below). SeParation of programs and linguistic data","The second classical principle is to offer metalanguages, in order to keep the particular linguistic data (grammars, dictionaries) separated from the programs. --437-- For instance, dictionary look-up is a standard function, which should not be modified in any way when a new language is introduced in the System. This separation also corresponds to a division of work and enhances transparency : dictionary look-up may be optimized by the programmers without the linguistic users ever being aware of it. The same goes for more complex functions, like pattern-matching in tree manipulating systems. In these metalanguages, linguists work directly with familiar concepts, like grammatical variables, classes, dictionaries and grammars. The grammar rules are rules of Some formal model (context free, context sensitive, transduction rules). That is, one may also consider such metalanguages as very high level algorithmic languages offering complex data types and associated operators. Although this principle of separation has been criticized as imposing too much \"rigidity\" on the users, critics have failed to understand that this is only the case when the metalanguages are not adequa~. A good comparison may be found in classical programming, where for example, the compiler and run-time package of PL/I is separated from programs written PL/I in exactly the same sense.

The theoretical framework is the one of a formal language, with a syntax describing the combination rules of the language units. There is no direct way, for instance, to relate two lexical units. In order for this to be possible, there should be a (formalized) domain, possibly represented as a thesaurus, and rules of interpretation. However, this limitation may be partially overcome in ARIANE-78's lexical transfer step. Remark also that semantic features may be extremely refined for some limited universe, and give surprisingly good results [TAUM-METEO, J975]. 2. Principles p.roper_ to GETA's sy§tem","We relate them to the three main principles exposed above. Intermediate structures","In ARIANE-78, we split up each of the three main phases into two steps. This is essentially for algorithmic as well as for linguistic reasons, Morphological analysis, lexic~ transfer and morphological generation are undoubtedly very much simpler than the order steps, and it has seemed reasonable and linguistically motivated to keep them separate and to use simpler algorithmic models to realize them. However, this could not be the case in other environments, for example if the input would be very noisy (oral input).","ARIANE-78 uses a unique kind of data-structure to represent the unit of translation from morphological analysis to morphological generation, namely a"]},{"title":"complex labeled tree structure","paragraphs":[": each node of such a tree bears a value for each of the \"grammatical variables\" used in the current step.

AMB searches for the most important terms of the clause (subject, object, near dative), thereby resolving ambiguities between subject and object, adjectives and adverbs, etc. NALF treats non-alphabetical forms as appositions or verbal complements.

Lexical transfer","Lexical transfer is written in TRANSF. It essentially includes a bilingual multichoice dictionary of \"transfer rules\" accessed by the UL.
