In an applicative framework, the pattern match must return a value that can be acted upon by other functions. The pattern itself has been generalized to a much more powerful data object, called the FORM.","Post-X is an experimental language designed for string processing, and for the other types of operations that one often undertakes in computational linguistics and language data processing.","In the design of Post-X, the following four goals have been foremost: (I) To modernize the Markov algorithm based pattern matching paradigm, as embodied in such languages as COMIT 13 and SNOBOL 8 ; (2) To provide a language useful in computational linguistics and language data processing, in particular, but hopefully with wider applicability; (3) To provide a vehicle for the study of applicative programming, as advocated by Backus , among others; (4) To provide a vehicle to study the application of natural language devices in programming languages, as advocated by Hsu 9 and Reekerl~","A FORM consists of a series of alternative PATTERNS and related ACTIONS. Each pattern is very much like a pattern in SNOBOL4 (with some slight variations). FORMS may be passed parameters (by value), which are then used in the pattern or action portion.","A PATTERN determines the structure of the string to which it is matched. The pattern contains a sequence of concatenated elements, which are themselves PATTERNS, PRIMITIVE PATTERNS (utilizing most of the SNOBOL4 primitives) or STRINGS. The value returned by the pattern is either FALSE (if it fails to match) or a \"parse tree\" designating the structure of the string that corresponds to portions of the pattern. As an example, suppose that a pattern is P:=p1P̂2.̂..p̂n\" It may be matched to a string S=SoSl...s n by the use of the operator '~in\", and if each of the Pi match a successive letter s j, one can conceptualize the \"tree\" returned as s O s I • .. s n Sn+ I","The \"X\" in \"Post-X\" stands for \"experimental\", and is a warning that features of the language and its implementation may change from one day to the next. The eventual goal is to produce a language designed for wide use, to be called \"Post\" (after the logician Emil Post). In this paper, we shall present some of the language's facilities for string and tree processing. A more detailed statement of th~ rationale behind the language can be found in , and more~details of the language are to be found in- . Pattern Matching","The basic idea of using pattern matching to direct a computation is found in the normal algorithms of Markov, and was embodied in the early string processing language COMIT. The series of SNOBOL languages developed at Bell Laboratories, culminating in SNOBOL4, improved a number of awkward features of COMIT and added some features of their own. Among these latter was the idea of patterns as data objects.","Post-X incorporates patterns into an applicative framework, which will be illustFated below. In doing so, the powerful pattern matching features of SNOBOL4 have where s O represents the unmatched portion to the left of the matched portion and Sn+. the portion to the right of the matched portion.","The numbers I ..... n and the characters < and > in the example are SELECTORS, used in the ACTION portion to refer to the appropriate substring. The tree returned is denoted by $$, and ! is used for selection, but $$! can be condensed to $ in this context, so the expression $ < returns s O in the example above, while $ 2 returns s 2. The selectors give the effect of the short persistence variables that were found in COMIT, where they were denoted by numerals. These variables had the advantage of having their scope limited to a single line of the program, thus minimizing the number of variables defined at any one time. In Post-X, the selectors are local to a particular FORM.","Each of the s may be a subtree, rather","than a string. In the example above, if Pl","P̂ ̂.P̂in, then in were defined as P11be12the subtree","place of s I would Sll s12 Sln --520-- where is the portion matched by P11 etc. Then s11Sllwould be referenced by $ I . I.","Composition of functions is often necessary. For the composition of F and G, we write F:G. For example head:sort where \"head\" gives the first element of a sequence and \"sort\" sorts a sequence of strings into alphabetical order, defines a function which operates on a sequence of strings and gives the first in alphabetical order.","Certain natural variations in the syntax are permitted. For example expression Iop expression 2 is defined to be the same as (op):[expression I, expression2]. The existence of a conditional function cond [a,b,c] producing \"b v' or \"c\" depending on \"a\" is vital; Post-X allows for a multi-way branch of the form if condition I then expression I elif condition 2 then expression 2 elif else expression fi"]},{"title":"n","paragraphs":["the form","do sequence of names expression od is an expression whose value is the function which may be applied to a sequence of epxressions, the value of each of which is given in the expression (in the d_o_o ... o d) by the corresponding name (i.e. call-by-value). The value of the application is the value of the expression (with \"substituted\" parameters). User-defined functions are named by declarations, examples of which are given later, and defined In","•","We have already discussed the bas,ic pattern matching operation and the definition of the FORMS used in that operation. As may be apparent from that discussion, context free parsing creates no difficulties. Thus we may define E:=E\"̂+\"T̂ I T T:=T\"̂*\"F̂ I F F:=,,(,,Ê,̂,),, I ,,x,, Then the pattern match E = \"x+x*x\" will return the tree (E) (E) +~T (E) + (T) (T) (T) * (~) (F) (F) x X X The default action is to produce an unlabelled tree \"compressed\" by the elimination of single offspring nodes.

If the first alternative fails, it means that there is no nonterminal.

The entire program will be invoked as RAND STRING GRAM := (REPLACE GRAM) <\"<S>\".

A KWIC Index of Titles","It is assumed that the input consists of a sequence of titles. It is desired to provide a primitive alphabetized KWIC index. An input of [\"An analysis of the English present perfect\" \"The role of the word in phonological development\"] will produce [\"<An> analysis ...\" \"An <analysis> ...\" \"... in phonological <development>\" ... etc.] The top-level program to do this is (I) KWIC := (2) UNION ALPHA [(<)[PARTITION]].

Line (4) sorts the sequence obtained (SORT is a built-in function), and Line (5) removes the word added to the beginning of the string in line (3).","The forms PARTITION, TAGFRONT, and REMOVE are defined as follows:","PARTITION :=","SPAN(,A,..,Z,) ,̂ , {E'<'$̂I'̂>'$̂2$̂>] ,̂ ALPHA:CAT[S1] (PARTITION<S>)}"]},{"title":"ISPAN('A'..'Z') {'<'$̂1'̂> '}","paragraphs":["The SPAN matches the first word, and the action part of the form places that word ($I) between angle brackets.

Tree Processin 9 in Post-X","Tree processing facilities are pattern-directed and similar to string processing facilities. As pointed out earlier, labelled trees may be represented as strings containing brackets. The pattern BAL, carried over from SNOBOL4, is used to match a full, well-formed subtree, but is extended to allow a specification of the value of that tree. Some tree functions are added for use in forms. The function FUSE fuses a sequence of subtrees together at their top node, leaving the label unchanged. In a tree form, as illustrated --523-- below, the use of a text string refers to a subtree with that label, but the function LABEL will return the label itself. The function RELABEL (tree, name) changes the label on a subtree to that named.","Post-X tree processing facilities are currently undergoing a careful study, and may be changed, but their present capabilities can be illustrated by the specification of forms for two linguistic transformations in English, EQUI NP DELETION and THERE INSERTION:","EQUI NP DELETION:=TREE(\"NP\"B̂AL\"̂S\"B̂AL(\"NP ''̂ BAL) {If $I=$4~I then $I$̂2$̂3$̂412}","THERE INSERTION:=TREE(\"S\"B̂AL(\"NP\"B̂AL\"̂V ''̂ BALÂRB) {$1F̂USE(\"there\"$̂2~3 ̂ $2!2$̂2~4)) These can be compared to a \"conventional\" formulation :","EQUI NP DELETION: X NP y [NP Y] Z S S Structural Index I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Structural Change I, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6 where 2=4 THERE INSERTION: X [NP V 4] Z","2 S Structural Index I, 2, 3, 4, 5 Structural Change I, THERE+3, 2, 4, 5 Illustrating the application of these,","THERE INSERTION in [S[NP[Det[A]N[boy]]","VP[V[is]PP[Prep[in]","NP[Det[the]","N[garden]]]]]","[S[there V[is]NP[Det[A]N[boy]]","PP[Prep[in]NP[Det[the] N[garden]]]]]].","Tree forms are not as natural as they might be, and changes can be expected, with the major goal being to make their use as closely analogous to that of strings as possible. Sequences","Post-X has a number of facilities that apply generally to sequences of items. These have been illustrated in the examples by, for instance, the operator ALPHA, which applies a function to each element of a sequence, and UNION, which takes a sequence of sequences and creates a single sequence.","Less obvious, perhaps, is the fact that strings and unlabelled trees are themselves sequences; in fact, sequences form the unifying notion within Post-X data structures. There remains work to be done to determine how effectively one can generalize pattern directed processing to sequences without adding too much complexity to the language.","The LISP programmer will tend to identify sequences with lists, in the sense of that language. There are differences, however. The facilities in LISP are oriented toward lists as right-branching binary trees, and though one can build LISP functions to overcome this, the programmer generally must manage the lists with their links in mind. In Post-X, the programmer is encouraged to deal with the sequence directly, as one becomes accustomed to dealing with strings directly in a string processing language. Discussion","The SNOBOL4 language has had few competitors over the years as a general string-processing language. Its development and distribution were undertaken by Bell Laboratories, and thus it has been widely available for more than a decade. Yet SNOBOL4 has never been as widely used for large applications, including those in computational linguistics, as one might expect, and in the light of a decade's experience, it is possible to identify various difficulties that account for this.","The basic string processing operation of SNOBOL4, pattern matching, is not the source of these difficulties. In fact, SNOBOL4 pattern matching provides a high-level-data-directed facility that should be a standard for other languages. The major problems were in the fact that the pattern-matching was never sufficiently eeneralized, leading to a II lit linguistic schism , that the syntactic conventions of SNOBOL4 led to difficulties and poor structuring 5 , and that the necessity of constantly assigning values to string variables was clumsy and tended to obscure the semantics of all but the simplest programs","Recently, various attempts have been made to remedy the problems mentioned above. But to give up pattern matching, as in Icon 7 or to resort to a less rich vocabulary of patterns, as in Poplar11(despite which, the latter language has a good deal of merit), is to \"discard the baby with the bathwater\". Post-X is the result of attempts to extend pattern matching and to improve it, at the same time providing a more natural, flexible and comprehensible linguistic vehicle. --524--"]},{"title":"References I.
