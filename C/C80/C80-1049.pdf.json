We use a popular intelligent terminal TEKTRONIX 4051 for inputting and editing,IBM 370 model 138 for KWIC making and sorting, and CANON's laser beam printer for final output.","Using these systems,\"Kotmai Tra Sam Duang\"(the Three Seals Law)which contains many kind of laws and ordinances proclaimed in Thai between 1350-1805 A.D. is computerized. This text has 1700 pages and about 1400000 letters. KWIC index becomes 200000 lines.","Some statistical data for this text are obtained. They are occurrence frequency data of single letter,group vowel, and letter combination(digram),etc. Aknowledgements","This report is a result of joint project at National Museum of Ethnology. The member are Y.Ishii, I.Akagi, S.Tanabe Y.Sakamoto, S.Uemura, A.Ishizawa, M.Sawamura, K.Sasaki, Y.Kurita, and S.Sugita. Their research field are ethnology,linguistics,computer science,and sociology etc.","We thanks Mr. Sophon Chitthasatcha, Miss Sumalee Maungpaisaln and Miss Hiroe Matsumoto for their help in Segmentation, inputting and correction.","We also thanks Prof. K.Nakayama and A.Oikawa of Tsukuba University for their support on making Thai letter patterns and output software for laser beam printer. Introduction","In the field of ethnology or cultural anthlopology,ethnographies are very important information sources for comparative study of many different societies. Not only bibliographic data but also contents of text are necessary.","HRAF(Human Relations Area Files), which was developed by Dr. Murdock and now managed by HRAF Inc. at Yale University,is a unique retrieval system. They use about 800 category codes by which analysts classify the contents of each pages of books.","Though HRAF system is an elaborate work,it is not easy to search necessary data by user terms,that is,natural words. If whole text are fed into computer,it is very easy to retrieve any part of text by the same natural words used in the text.","On-line retrieval system is smart and effective. But sometimes researcher wants printted index like as KWIC which is usable at any time and place. Combining KWIC index and thesaurus dictionary,it gives us a very powerful tools for searching special expression hidden in the text.","Till quite recentry,at least in Japan,most cases of computer processing of natural language are distored to indo-europian language or Japanese. In the ethnological studies,we must treat many areas in the world. We need computer softwares which process unfamiliar languages for us,such as Arabic,Korean, Sumerian,Mongolian,Devanagari,Thai,etc.","National Museum of Ethnology at Osaka has introduced several computer systems to encourage humanity study,and now is developing many application softwares which are usable by any researchers who do not know computer programming or how to use computer.","This report describes one of such application softwares which treats Thai letters. The points of our work are as follows; i) A popular computer terminal is used for Thai letter inputting and editing. It is easy to use because dead key operation is not necessary. 2) KWIC making and sorting software are implemented using FORTRAN language which can be transfered to any other computer system. The algorithm is not so complex but it was not implemented only because they are not popular language. 3) Statistical data of the text are obtained. They are occurrence frequency of single letter,group vowel,and letter combination. These data will help us as a contexial data in case of OCR. - -330","• Seqmentation","There is no segmentation problems in case of indo-europian languages,because they have clear separator for word unit such as space or comma. There are, however, many languages in Asia which have no clear separator. They are Korean (Hangul),Chinese,Japanese,and Thai,etc. Examples shown below mean that there exist several different segmentation. Segmentation affects to the meaning of sentence and retrieval efficiency. 0 ~ -,- O L -r-e L. -~- Fig.l Examples of different segmentations","To cut into long unit is effort saving, but it is difficult to search the string included in that unit. To cut into short unit is effective for searching, but too many keywords appear.","The text, the Three Seals Law, has no word separator, as shown in fig.3. So it is necessary to segment into appropriate units before making KWIC index. But it is difficult problem because segmentation needs well understanding of meaning, which conversely needs KWIC index.","We adopted a practical method which at first cut into long unit and then cut again after looking KWIC index."]},{"title":"I_ RE-'SEGI\"IEN TATIOt'~ i--'i","paragraphs":["Inputting Terminal","We use a popular intelligent graphic terminal TEKTRONIX 4051 which has usual alphabet keyboard. We sticked Thai letter labels on the side of each key as if it looks like Thai typewriter. A code table of Thai letters and coresponding english alphabets is shown in Table i.","The characteristics of this terminal are; i) It generates Thai letter pattern by BASIC program in graphic mode. User can affirm the letter he typed. 2) It has local cassett memory, so that user can input and edit data anytime, even when host computer is not working. 3) By way of communication line, stored data can be transmitted to host computer for time consuming work. 4) It is easy to implement a flexible Thai language editor, which accept alphabet commands and display Thai letters. 5) Copy of screen can be taken by the hard copy unit attached to it. Rules for text inputting","The text has many irregular expressions. So following expediencies are adopted. i) Quotated words or phrases from Pali language are skipped by inserting special symbol to indicate there are skipped words."]},{"title":"ORIGIHAL","paragraphs":["TEXT"]},{"title":"~EGIIENTAT 1014 IHPUTTIHG I 1700 Pages 200000 units 1400000 strokes [__zO_RRE, UTION, I","paragraphs":["Thai editor"]},{"title":"-----[ £TA'T I ST'i CQL DATA M __I","paragraphs":["...."]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["...... £ ORTING"]},{"title":"printer","paragraphs":["Fig.2 Flow diagram of KWIC making -331 2)Tables are skipped. 3)Special expressions for money,dating, and fractional number are transformed into sentence form. 4)Vertical expression shown in Fig.3 are attached special symbol after and before the word. 5)Parallel expression in the middle of line,and tree like expression are transformed into linear form from which original form can be reconstructable as much as possible.
