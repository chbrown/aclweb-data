The kernel sentence forms (for English) are defined as the string of"]},{"title":"class marks N ~ ~ followed by one of the kernel Object strings: ~, N, ~, ~P__~, __~, e~, D, A (m Noun; ~: ~ense/aux; ~: verb; ~: preposition;","paragraphs":["D: adverb; ~: adjective; ~ : zero). Thus John bou~h't'a book; Nar~ will come etc. are kernel sentences. Each transformation is characterized by certain permutations, deletions or additions of specific class marks or constants. In the resultant of a transformation one may look for s ubsequenceswhich remain~xg~n~ even when the resultant is subjected to further transformations. The 5asic features of the algorithm are a) stating the various invarlant sequences and b) formulating I) a grammar of such Invarlant sequences, 2) a corre~ spondlng recognition procedure, and 3) a systematic procedure for computing the kernel sentences as well as other kernel-like sentences and the corresponding transformational history. It should be emphasized tha t i t is not assumed and also not impl~ed in the algorithm that any kind of prior analysis (either strlng analysis or constituent analysis) is requlred as a prere~uisltelfor the present algorithm. ~Such a detailed description will appear later elsewhere. ++,+ ,..+ ++...,"]},{"title":"/i/+\\~","paragraphs":["1.2 Transformations are initially defined on kernel sentence forms. Howeverj they work on certain other sentence forms which are not kernel sentence forms. Thus a transformation is completely defined by first deflnlng it on a suitable kernel sentence form(s) and then extendlng • the ~omaln of the transformation to other \"sentence forms. This exte~.- slon which contains infinitely many sentence forms can be represented by+ first listing a finite number of sentence forms in the extension and all the remaining sentence forms in the extension are obtained by certain recurslve rules (see the i-llsts in 1.3). 1.3 A unan~.z, transformation transforms one sentence form into another sentence form and a bi~nary transformation transforms a pair of sentence forms into another sentence form. Each unary transformation defined on a sentence form may be represented by a sequence of class marks constituting another sentence form. Most binary transformations can be defined as interruptions of certain unary transformation sequences at stated positions by certain other sequences of class marks. These In-terruptlng sequences are not sentence forms but are deformatlons_-o~ sen-","\" -------\"--'se ~ o~ <+ tence forms corresponding to the ~ sentence form of the binsry transformation. For example, John was detained by the old woman decom~ses into woman detained John and woman t be old with a passive transformation on the first kernel and a binary transformation on the sentence John was detained by the woman and the kernel sentence woman t be old. ~ The sentence form corresponding to the passive transformation, N t be en V by N is then interrupted by the sequence AN before the last AN is a deformation of the kernel sentence form N t be A symbol. -- which is the second sentence form of the binary transformation. The resulting sentence form is thus N t be en V by A B,. In the resulting sentence form the shared symbol N appears only once. Such a symbol which two transformation sequences • share (or on which t_hey overlap) be ignore here the article th.._~e for simplicity. a. 2 -- wlll be called a residue of one.sequence with respect to another. 2 In addition to the transformation sequences which are sentence forms, and the interrupting sequences (deformed sentence forms) which correspond to most binary transformations, there is yet another type of interrupting sequences (again deformed sentence forms) which correspond tonominalizatlons. For example consider: the book was written by Brown and John's travel to Italy was descrlbed by Mar~. In the second sentencej the kernel sentence John travelled to Italy is mappedonto the object of Mary described before the resultant undergoes the same passive which acted on Brown wrote the book giving the first sentence. N's nV P N (John's travel to Italy) is a nominalizati0n which appears in many dlfferent transformations and carries in them the associated kernel into one of the positions which could be occupied by a noun. For each transformation sequence in each intersymbol position we llst all interrupting sequences (including both the second and the third kind of sequences as dlscussedabove). Of course, the interrupting sequences have their own interrupting sequences, etc. These Intersymbol interrupting lists will be called i-lists. 2. A sketch of the algorithm 2.0 As stated in i, in order to define the set of all transforms we need a set Of sequences of class marks (or class mark-llke symbols) which has 3 subsets. 1. Sequences each of which corresponds to a sentence form (e.g. the passive sequence N t be en V by N); 2. Sequences each of which represents a deformed kernel-form and Is not a sentence form, but when inserted between specified neighboring symbols of a sequence of the first set~ preserves the character of the sentence form (e.g. _~j en V N); 3. Sequences each of which represents a deformed kernel-form and is ~he concept of the residue can be extended to shared sequences as well as sequences which replace a given symbol in another sequence. The term carrier is used in this context. This device has been extensively used in this algorithm. -3-not a sentence form, but, when substituted for a symbol in a sequence (of ~et I or 2 or 3), preserves the character of that sequence (e.g. er V or/L , n A of N). There are also rules for inserting sequences from the second set into other sequences or into sequences of the third set, without changing the character of either. All insertion or replacement rules are stated in the interruption lists appearing between every pair of adjacent symbols of each sequence. Most of the sequences in the first set represent unary transformations of kernel forms. Many are extended (often by permitting the replacement of certain symbols with selected sequences from the third set) to include analogous unary transforms of kernel-llke forms. The second set of sequencesj together with the rules of their insertion in the sequences for unary transformations, account for most of the binary transformations. Other binary transformations are represented by replacement in pairs of class marks in unary transformation sequences by members of the third sets most of which consist of nomlnalizations. An arbitrarily long English sentence form can be seen as composed of a finite number of such sequences recurstvely embedded in one another. 2.1 Corresponding to the above three subsets of sequences and their mutual embedding rules, we recognize three sets of strings. Each string is a program for comparing one of the sequences with a portion of the analyzed sentence form of the data. The program is equipped to permit interruption by other such programs according to the i-lists of the sequence. Each string, when entirely matched by a segment Of data, replaces that segment with the carrier of the string. The carrier is sometimes null. In strings from the second set it is usually the residue of the binary insert (e.g. the center symbol of a noun phrase: N of AN, of~,etc.). In strings from the third set the carrier is a class-mark-llke symbol which, by replaclng a class-mark in a formderlved from a kernel form I extends it to one simi- --4 -- larly derived from a kernel-llke form. Let the carrier be~[nV~] for a noun phrase built around an nV. The extended passive form: N[or~[nV]] t be en V by N represents the form of the sentence John's travel to Italy was described by Haryas soon as the carrier of the str~ng replaces in the data the nomlr~ ! segment John's travel to Italy. The carrier from all strings in the first set is s, a symbol of a well-formed sentence. The program'of eachl string, whose sequence is a deformed (Or transforme~) kernel or kernel-like form, reconstructs that form for decomposition and attaches £o it a labe___~l descrlptive of the deformation (or transformation). The result of a decomposition is a set of kernel or kernel-llke sentences with labels. Some of the kernel sentences are / incomplete and have blanks in them because a transformation may de t ~ ....... elements. Some kernel-llke sentences may contain, instead of a wo/rd) a class-mark-llke symbol (e.g,~) with a reference.to aprevlous com-",") ponent of the decomposition. If that previous component is a kernel sentence (with or without blanks), then the label (describlr~ the deformation) with the kernel-llke form (containing the reference) with its label, together constitute a description of the transformation undergone by the component kernel sentence. If the previous component itself is a kernel-llke sentence with a reference in turn to another component, both'kernel-llke sentences and all three labeis constitute the description of the transformatlonundergone by the c~,nponent kernel sentence ultimately referred to s etc. If the symbol x appears, instead of a word, in a kernel or ker' nel-llke sentence, it replaces a regular noun there. It is introduced in the sentence as a carrier from a nominallzation such as a teacher of Latln, .the driving instructor, etc. The same x must appear in two or more sentences of the decomposition •(onewhere the nominal stands for a noun, and one in the sentence of whlch the nominallzatlon is a deformation, e.g. x - teach Latin). Which x's require identical substitutions is discoverable, because each x has in a sharp bracket (< >) the names of every prevlous llne in which the same x appeared, often no actual substltutionls posslble and the x serves only to identlfy ~ with each other, two or more blanks in different components. The substitution of the noun replacing N for x in lines aj bj . . . d is implied when one kernel-llke component has the form I t be x ~/a~ b . . . d> . 2.2 The three sets of strings (programs) constitute the major portion of granmmtlcal material in the algorithm. Another body o£ such material is the dlctlonar~. • The dictionary associates to each English word a symbol representing the wordts grannnatlcal class~ together with markers of certain addition-al characteristics the word may reveal by restricting its environment in the sentence. Some words may occur in more than one role and have there-fore several equlvalents in thedictlonary. (e.g. the word labor should","be given four different class marks: present tense Vs V(untensed verb)j (nomlnallzatlon deslgnatlngthe activity of laboring)~ er'V (nominal-","Izatlon designating the actor(s), possibly laborers in aggregate)).",":al","The dictionary for TransformationĈrannnar must carry far more de-","tails than is needed for the String Analysis alone. Thus for example the transformational analysis must be able to discover in Johnts sleep not only a nouh phrase~ but also the incomplete kernel sentence John-sleep ~ which underlies each transformation containing such a noun phrase.

(See i I of #30). Each verified postulate forces other • postulates as its consequences I until the termlnal period of the sentence is found which is consistent with a hypothesis. It is qulte likely that an analysis will produce more than one correct reading of a sentencej because structural ambiguity is even more frequent in transformational grammar than it is in the mere s~ring analysis. -7-3. Examples of decomposition Four examples of decomposition obtained by the algorithm follow. These examples are intended to exhibit the power of the algorithm. It is posslble I without changing the algorithm I to increase the power and depth of the analysis by incorporating more details about transformations as they become available by adding either new transformation sequences or adding new classes and new co-occurencerestrlctlons in the dictionary or both. Among the various issues which are nowrecelvlng further attentlon, some are as follows: a) a better characterization of nF-nouns and the underlylng kernel sentences in terms of which the modifiers can he explained (e.g. school prlnclpa~ (example 3), French teacher; ~ueen~ etc); b) the relation of classifier nouns to each other and their kernel positions with respect to'thelr modifiers (e.g. organ~","~e~¢er Ic"]},{"title":"chemistryj helpful trip, friendly ~e~j etc.); ¢) precise relatlon","paragraphs":["of constants (e.g. hi__ss~ both in example h) or classifier nouns with a definite artlcle to other nouns or phrases for which they are a replacement.
