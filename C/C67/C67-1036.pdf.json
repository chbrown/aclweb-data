'. \\ THE~ENTROPY OF RECURSIVE MARKOV PROCESSES By BENNY BRODDA KVAL, Fack, Stockholm 40, Sweden Summary The aim of this communication is to obtain an explicit formula for calculat-ing the entropy of a source which behaves in accordance with the rules of an arbitrary Phrase Structure Grammar, in which relative probabilities are attached to the rules in the grammar. With this aim in mind we introduce an alte~rnative definition of the concept of a PSG as a set of self-embedded (re-Cursive) Finite State Grammars; when the probabilities are taken into account in such a grammar we call it a Recursive Markov Process. 1. In the first section we give a more detailed definition of what kind of Markov Processes we are going to generalize later on (in sec. 3), and we also outline the concept of entropy in an ordinary Markov source. More details \"of information may be foupd~ e.g., in Khinchins \"Mathematical Foundations of Information Theory\", N.Y. ~ 1957~ or \"Information Theory\" by R. Ash, N. Y. , 1965. A Markov Grammar is defined as a Markov Source with the following propertie s : Assume that there are n+ 1 states, say S O , S1, ..., Sn, in the source. S O is defined as the initial state and S is defined as the final state and the other","n states are called intermediate states. We shall, of course, also have a transition matrix, M = (Pij), containing the, transition probabilities of the source. a) A transition from state S i to state S k is always accompanied by a production of a (non-zero) letter aik from a given finite alphabet. Transition to different states from one given state alway s produce different letters. b) From the\" initial state, S0~ direct or indirect transitions should be possible to any other state in the source. From no state is a transition to S O allowed. c) From any state, direct or indirect transitions to the final state S should","n be possible. From S n no transition is allowed to any other state (S n is an \"absorbing state\"). The work reported in this paper has been sponsored by Humanistiska forskningsr~det, Tekniska forskningsr~det and Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, Stockholm, Swederi. A (grammatical) sente'nce should now be defined as the (left-to-right) concatenation of the letters produced by the source, when passing from the initial state to the final state. The length of a sentence is defined as the number of letters in the sentence. To simplify matters without dropping much of generality we also require that d) The greatest common divisor for all the possible lengths of sentences is = l (i.e., the source becomes an aperiodic source, if it is short-circuited by identifying the final and initial states). ~- With the properties a - d above, the source obtained by identifying the final and initial states is an indecomposable, ergodic Markov process (cf. Feller, \"Probability Theory and Its Applications\", ch. 15, N. Y. s 1950). In the transition matrix M for a Markov grammar of our type all elements in the first column are zero, and in the last row all elements are zero except the last one which is = 1. For a given Markov grammar we define the uncertainty or entropy, Hi, for each state S i, i = 0, 1 .... , n, as: n Hi=~l Pij l°g Pij; i= 1, Z ..... n."]},{"title":"j=O","paragraphs":["We also define the entropy, H or H(M), for the grammar as n= 1","(1). = x.H.","1 1 i= 0 where x = (x0, x z, ..., Xn_l) is defined as the stationary distribution-~ the source obtained when S O and S n are identified; thus x is defined as the (unique) solution to the set of simultaneous equations"]},{"title":"(z)","paragraphs":["xM 1 = x x0 + X l + ''\" + Xn-1 = 1 where M 1 is formed by shifting the last and first columns and then omitting the last row and column. The mean sentence length. ~, of the set of grammatical sentences can now be easily calculated as (3) = 1/x 0 (cf. Feller, op. tit.) 2. Embedded Grammars We now assume that we have two Markov grammars, M and M1, with states S O , S 1 .... , S n, and T o , T I, ..., T m, respectively, where S O ands n, T O and T m are the corresponding initial and final states. Now consider two states S i and S k in the grammar M; assume that the corresponding transition probability is = Pik\" We now transform the grammar, M1, into a new one, M], by embedding the grammar M 2 in M 1 between the states S i and Sk, an operation which is performed by identifying the states T O and T with the","m states S i and S k respectively.

(It is quite natural that this number appears as a weight in the formula, since if one is producing a sentence according to the grammar M and arrives at the state S i and from there \"dives\" into the grammar M1, then ~1 is the expected waiting time for emerging again in the main grammar M.) The factor xiPik may be interpreted as the combined probability of ever arriving at.S i and there choosing the path over to M 1 (you may, of course, choose quite another path from Si). The proof of formula (4) is very'straightforward, once the premises according to the above have been given, and we omit it here, as it does not give much extra insight to the theory. THe formula may be extended to the case when there are:more than one sub-grammar embedded in the grammar M', by adding similar terms as the one standing, to the right in the numerator and the denominator. The important thing here is that the factors of the type x.p.~ depend only on the probability matrix for the grammar M and are de-1 1 pendent of the sub-grammars involved. 3. Recur sive or Self-embedded Sources ~-. .... It is now quite natural to allow a grammar to have itself as a sub-grammar or to allow a grammar M 1\" to contain a grammar M~. which, in its turn, contains M 1, and so on. The grammars thus obtained cannot, howeverB be rewritten as an ordinary Markov grammar. The relation between an ordinary Markov grammar and a recursive one is~exactly similar to the relation between Finite state Languages and Phrase Structure Languages. To be more precise, assume that we have a set of Markov grammars M~ M l ..... M~ where MI 0 is called the main grammar and in the sense that the process always starts at the initial state in M ~ and ceases when it reaches the final state in M 0. Each of the grammars may contain any number of the others (and itself) as sub-grammars. The only restriction is that from any state in any one of the grammars there should exist a path which ends up at the final state of M O. Remark If we interpret a source of our kind as a Phrase Structure Language, the rewriting rules are all of the following kind: (5) S i -* Aik + Sk o..r_r S n -, #; where the S' s are all non-terminal symbols. (They stand for the names of the states in the sources - M~, l~i I ..... M~and where S O is assumed to be the initial symbol /the Chomskyan S/ and S n is the terminating state which produces the sentence delimiter #.
