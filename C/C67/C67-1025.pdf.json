Edmundson University of California, Los Angeles i. Introduction i.i.- Background This work is a continuation of research reported in the paper Mathematical Models of S~non~, which was presented at the 1965 International Conference on Computational Linguistics. That paper presented a historical summary of the concepts of synonymy and antonyms. It was noted that since the first book on English syno-DS, which appeared in the second half of the lath century, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms have varied according to the particular explicit definitions of \"synonym\" and \"antonym\" that were used. The roles of part-of-speech, context of a word, and substitutability in the same context were discussed. Traditionally, synonymy has been regarded as a binary relation between two words. Graphs of these binary relations were drawn for several sets of words based on Webster's Dictionary of S~non~ms and matrices for these graphs were exhibited as an equivalent representation. These empirical results showed that the concepts of synonymy and entonymy required the use of ternary relations between two words in a specified sense rather than simply a binary relation between two words. The synonymy relation was then defined implicitly, rather than explicitly, by three axiams stating the properties of being reflexive, symmetriC, and t/~ansitive. The entonym¥ relation was also defined by three axioms stating the properties of being irreflexive, symmetric, and antit/~ansit~ve (the last term was coined for that study). It was noted that thes~ six axioms could be expressed in the calculus of relations and that this relation algebra could be used to produce shorter proofs of t~eorems. However, no proofs were given. In addition, several gec~aet~ical and topological models of synonymy and antonymy '..J~ were posed and examined. ,~ It was nOted that certain of these models were of more theoretical than practical interest. Each model was seen to be simple in that"]},{"title":"it\"","paragraphs":["could be expressed from mathematically elementary concepts, end each stressed certain aspects of the linguistic object being modeled at the expense of others. However, there seemed to be little theoreti~al preference among them. Their adequacy as models could be measured by their generality and predictive power. In terms of these criteria the algebraic model, whether expressed in terms of relations, graphs, or matrices, seamed to have the most usefulness. In part, this was due to the fact that one geametrical model, although highly suggestive, did not include a precise specification of the origin, axes, or coordinates for words in an n-dimensional space. Similarly, one topological model required a closure operation for each of the intensions or senses and had no linguistically interesting interpretation. 1 1.2 Summary The present paper investigates more thoroughly the characterizations of synonymy and antonymy initiated in Edmundson (1965). In section 2, synonymy and antonymy are defined jointly and implicitly by a set of axioms rather than separately as before. First, it is noted that the original six axioms are insufficient• to permit the proofs of certain theorems whose truth is strongly suggested by intuitive notions about synonyms and antonyms. In addition, it is discovered that certain fundamental assumptions about synonymy and antonymy must be made explicit as axioms. Some of these have to do with specifying the domain and range of the synonymy and antonymy relations. This is related to questions about whether function words, which linguistically belong to closed classes, should have synonyms and antonyms and whether content words, which linguistically belong to open classes, must have synonyms and antonyms. Several fundamental theorems of this axiom system are stated andproved. The informal interpretation of many of these theorems are intuitively satisfying. For example, it is proved that any even power of the antonymy relation is the synonymy relation, while any odd power is the antonymy relation."]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["In section 3, topological characterizations are posed and examined.

Introduction - Relations Before investigating antonymy and synonymy, we will estsblish some notions and notations for the calculus of binary relations. Consider a set V of arbitrary elmnen~s, which will be called the universal set. A binary relation on V is defined as a set R of ordered pairs <x,p, where x,y s V. The proposition that x stands in relation R toy will be denoted by xRy. The dcmain~Y(R), range ~(R), and field ~ (F) of relation R are, respectively, defined by the sets [x:(~y)(xRy)] ; (y:(~Lx)(xRy)} ; [x:(~y)(xRy)} U (y:(~x)(xRy)] The complement, union, intersection, and converse relstions are defined by x~y = -.x~ ; x(RUS)y - x~vxSy ; x(RnS)y \" x~x~; xR'ly -- yRx The identity relation I and null relation ~ are defined by xIy ~ x=y ; ~y - (x~x),V~(y~y) The product .and power relations are defined by xRISy = (.~z)[xRz ẑSy] ; R n =-"]},{"title":"RIR n'l n~ 1","paragraphs":["Inclusion and equality of relations are defined by RC S =- xRy ==> xSy ; R = S m R c SA S c R Later we will use the following elementary theorems which are stated here without proof: Theorem: R g S ==> R \"I c_ S \"I","m","-- Theorem: R c S ~> S c R Theorem: (R'I) \"I = R Theorem: (RIS)IT : RI(SIT ) Theorem: (RIS) \"I = S'IIR \"I","Theorem: IIR = RII =","R"]},{"title":"Theorem: s -r => RIs=RIT ̂SIR=TIR","paragraphs":["2.2 Axioms and Definitions","Under the assumption that synonymy and antonymy are ternary relations","on the set C of all content words, the following definitions will be","used: xSiY = word x is a synonym of word y with respect to the","intension i (or word x is synonymous in sense i to","word y) xAiY -= word x is an antonym of word y with respect to the in-","tension i (or word x is antonymous in sense i to word y) We will assume that the synonymy and antonymy relations are defined Jointly and implicitly bythe following set of axioms rather than separately as in Edmundson (1965).

Topological Characterizations 3.1. Introduction We will now examine two topological models of synonymy. Being topological, they concern \"semantic spaces\" of words without any notion of \"semantic distance\" between two words. Again, we will restrict our attention to content words. Topological models for the antonymy relation will not be considered. 3-2. Neighborhood Topology The first model considers a neighborhood topology, i.e., a topology based on neighborhoods.

Ca~nents on Topological Characterizations Note that for the neighborhood topology a separation sxicm has been added to the t~ree axioms proposed in Edmundson C1~5). Also, the neighborhood topology seems more intuitively satisfying than the closure topology.

Conc~sions These results support the belief that the algebraic characterization is insightful and appropriate. For example, the assumption that synonymy is an equivalence relation also has been made, either directly or indirectly, by F. Kiefer and S. Abraham (1965), U. Weinreich (1966), and others. Since the axiom system defines the notions of synonymy and anton~ Jointly and implicitly, it avoids certain difficulties that are encountered when attempts are made to define these notions separately and explicitly. iO These topological characterizations provide a no,metric representation of what has been called informally a \"semantic space\". Previous attempts to construct a semantic space that is metric (i.e., one for which a distance function is defined) have not met with much success. The consideration of general topological spaces avoids this difficulty. References","R. Carnap, Introduction to Symbolic Logic and Its Applications, W. Meyer and J. Wilkinson (trs.), Dover, N.
