For instance, both have subjects, verbs, objects, nominal groups, OOmmIt:L'ImLoni3. clauses and so one When it comes to finer details, though, the dlfferenoes between the two languages become more notieeable than the similarities: the use of auxiliary verbs I;O represent tenses, for instance, is quite different (e.g~ did not ask = we c npocx~)","The basic task of this model is to provide a means of representing in the computer a~ Russian graematieel structure wh:Loh th.e analysis algorithm a&y have to express. As far as possible this representation must be independent of the particular conventions of either language.

Such sets are known as systems. Our model therefore has two main linsuistic features, structure and system, which w~ both be needed to describe a Russian sentence. This tez~alnolo~ is taken f~oe the work of Halliday (1961).","~he structure is fundamental~ a hierarchy of constituents, but there are four ways in whieh it differs from a conventional constituent structure:","(1) Each constituent may e~eeplif~ choices in systems, and, as illustrated above, this means that some units in the tez~ (e.g. particles and auxiliaries) are not given places in the structure.","(2) One item may occupy more than one place in the structure.

These decisions are of course based on grammatical data only (both structural an~ systemic); in particular in the selection of equivalents no semantic or eolloeational techniques are used.","The particular tasks under these headin~ which are appropriate to a particular type of constituent will in general need to be carrie~ out whatever the role of the constituent in some higher structure may be; a~ we are therefore led to the need for a separate routine for each constituent type. Such a routine will be called a constituent type procedure (CTP). The nominal group CTP, for example, will be called upon when and only when a nominal group has to be produced by the program.","Since constituents nest within one another freely, one CTP will need to call on others to deal with the parts of the constituent in turn. The CTPs must in fact be written as fully recursive subroutines; and the program consists basically of a oontrol routine for exploring the list structure together with a set of CTPs, one for each constituent type.","As was pointed out by Yngve (1960), it is a lin&uistic fact (at least in the Indo-European family of lansuages to which Russian and English Both belong) that in ma~ constituents the final sub-constituent is a group of words, while other sub-constituents are more frequently single items. Thus ,multiple \"nestiu~ of the CTPs usually involves final suboonstituents. But in these cases all details of the higher constituent can be \"forgotten\" by ~e computer since that constituent will not need to be returned to; so even a long sentence nsede no great depth of push-down store to han~e the nested CTPs.

It implements such a decision simply by re~g the addresses in the element concerned. Each CTP entered does thls, so that the individual items are met in their new order and can be added to the output string at once.","The selection and inflection of equivalents are carried out at the time they are to be produced, when all relevant information is available to the CTP without excursions into other parts of the structure. The insertion of function words, on the other hand, say be done by a~y CTP.","The resulting English output string is then passed to a final program which is responsible for format control. The normal form of output is punched paper tape, from which the printed copy, as shown in McDaniel et al, (this conference), is produced on a 'Flex~writer'. There is an alternative form of output on punched cards, from which printed copy can be produced on a card-controlled typewriter. This earlier form gives the text in the two languages side by side, which was useful for research purposes, but the absence of lower-case Roman letters and pa~Lnation, add the restricted width of each language version, makes this form less well suited for general use.","This format control process, and the main control routine which deals with the exploration of the tree and the handover from one CTP to the next, need not be described further, but the tasks of the individual CTPs will be outlined below.
