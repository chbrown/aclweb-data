If we are interested in the problem not only from the side of theory but also that of its practical applicability, then we have to ensure the optimalization of the way the correct structure is revealed.The optimalization of analysis is related","- in many respects - to the requirement of simplicity in language theory. Of course the method to be applied is not in@ependent of the typological properties of the language under consideration,and this applies, above all, to the optimalization. 1.3. if we aim at the analysis of natural languages our main requirement may be much less stringent than the requirement of generative grammars. Generative grammars, quite reasonably, consider as a Varga 4 principal requirement that any grammar should generate all sentences of a given ~ .... ~ ~s~o~ and only these. An analogous stipul&tion is not necessary in the case of analysii we want to analyze only the case of artificial since we may ass~qe that impeccable sentences. /in languages - for instance, in the case of progra~ning languages - the situ~on is quite different: it is a basic requirement that the analyzator should be able to distinguish the syntactically impeccable strings from the incorrect ones, i.e. that he could disclose the syntactic faults./ Now the question is that what kind of methods or which combination of methods may lead to the recognition of the structure or structures of any syntactically impeccable sentence, within optimal time and with especial regardto highly inflecting languages. 2. With respect to the non-inflecting or only weakly inflecting languages there is a useful method for analysis, namely, the reversed application of the so-called rewriting rules. Besides its Varga 5 simplicity, this method offers quite a few advan- ~y it is based on the n~thematically well-formalized phrase structure grammars, secon~- !y, from a linguistic point of vie~.v, it is related to the IC grammar that has been elaborated for the analysis of natural languages.

The number of rules would amo'Ant, for instance, in Russian to about 30-40 thousand, %vhioh diminishes the applicability of the system considerably.

It is easy to see that the differences and inanimate, then we ~ould 3- Dependency grammars have been elaborate~ mainly to circumvent t~e ~ifficu!ties raised by inflectional languages. ~ ~ is interesting to note in passing that in the Soviet Union this conception prevails even today in the groups engaged in ma-Varga 7 chine translation. According to dependency grammar we have to consider the category of the distinguished ~or~ form as a representative of a complex category in each case a rewriting rule is applie6. In this way the concretness of the categories is main-tained. Xastly the predicate represents the whole sentence,standing as it aces at the top of the tree diagram. At first glance a dependency grammar seems to exhibit quite a few advantages from the point of view of highly inflecting languages. This advantages may be summarized as follows. \" ~) It 'traces back the relations within the sentence to .he relations h, et%,;een concrete woza forms. In this way the establishment of the sentence structure is traceable back to the establishment of the relations between concrete words, i.e. to the examination of micro-structures. (ii) In the case of highly inflecting languages v~heze the zelatimns between words come to the fore through their outer form, namely through the form of agreemerit and rection, the information obtained in this Varga 8 way may he used immed \"~ l- i~te y for finding out the sentence structure. (iii) On the basis of the direct relations between words the analysis may start at any point: at the top of the tree diagram or at the bottom or in the order given by the words of the sentence. ~v) No difficulty in principle is encountered in a dependency grammar analysis in the uniform handling of continuous and ~iscontinuous structures. /These structures are rather frequent in highly inflecting languages, due to the fact that they have more effective means at their disposal than word order for expressing relations between words./ In spite of these advantages dependency gramr~ars have not solved the problems definitively as it has turned out that these advantages are only of a rather restricted character. Ad (i). It may happen that the examination of the relation between two words does not provide enough information for further analysis. The statement of complementary conCitions is rather gifficult in Varga 9 these cases and can be done most cases only by an ad hoc a~jusment. Ad (iii). Although it is possible to begin the analysis at the top of the ~epen~ency tree, such an analysis eeman~s either a rather laborious testing process or the storing of a grat amount of information. / It is illuminating from this point of view to follow the ~evelopment of predictive analyses beginning with the original conception of Ida Rhodes up to the varianl elaborated by Kuno-Oettinger-Plath. Accor6ing to Rhodes the analysis is to be carried out on the basis of dependency grammar, beginning at the top of the dependency tree. The ne~v version of £ependency grammar is based thoroughly on ,the conception of IC grammars. As is ]~own, the main defect of the earlier version ~!as caused by the fact that when longer sentences were to be analyzee the predictions to be stored increased in an excessive way./ Ad (iv). In principle it woule be possible to analyze all possible cases of the discontinuous structures but such a full analysis seems to be unattainable in the forseeable future. / Kulagina's main Varga lO en~avour is aimed at excluding on the basis of a preliminary analysis those constructions that cannot be further expected an@ making possible"]},{"title":"F","paragraphs":["this analysis equal to the full analysis~2~/. In practice the analysis is al~(~ays carried out on the basis of some simplifying conditions or hypotheses concerning chiefly the @ecomposition of sentences or the relations of some structures/projectivity/. ¢. Different methods have been proposed to circumvent the difficulties raised by the IC grammar analysis. Choms~ tackles these proposals /proposals of Harris,Matthews, 8toch,:el], Anderson, Sohachter, Harman an~ others/ in his paper submitted to the Magdeburg conference; he concludes,\"the problem of remedying this defect in PSG is clearly very much open, and deserves much further study\" [3]. With respect to Russian it is Plath who has recently elaborated an ingeniou s inSexing and index-transmission system which sets out to ensure the many-sided applicability of the rules an~ the transmission of tile information from one symbol to another. Chomsky points to the fact that the indexing of Varga II categoriea and the introduction of complex symbols means essentially the application of a special type of transformational gramzar. Un@oubtedly, the pure methods have not yielded the expected results in the analysis of natural languages. Chomsky himself suggests a compromise with respect to similar ~if-ficuities that arise in generative grammars, 2tactically it goes about a new dimension,neglected so far, namely about the paradigmatic lavel. Chomsky pose~ the alternative straightforwardly : either one should accept the decomposition Into morphemes or opt for the para@igms. He himself pronounced in favour of the paradigmatic conception. Chomsk 7 has been led to this decision by the complexity of the morphemes. However, it should be added that quite different questions arise in the case of agglutinative languages where the inflectional morphemes generally serve to express a single grammatical function. So, for instance, in Hungarian hgzaknak = = hgz ÷ ak + nak house + P1 + Dat If we take account of this structure of words the decomposition into morphemes seems more justified. Varga 12 Taking into consideration the aspects of the syntactic a~aly~Is an intermediary solution offers it-self: with the aia of common rewriting rules /without increasing their number essentially/ a considerable part of the syntactic relations may be detected if we decompose the sentence - but only partially - into morphemes, i.e. if we separate the case category from the basic category. This means that we~may use the same symbols for the designation of cases of substantives, adjectives , pronouns etc. and it is necessary to decompose the correspon@ing categories. On the other hand, the case category is handled separately, the role of which is a syntactic one in the first place. Last but not least it facilitates the separation of case and gender - number which is important in the processing of relative pronouns. A similar situation can also be produced artificially in the case of the machine translation of nonagglutinative languages. As in machine translation the morphological analysis precedes the syntactic one, in practice there are no difficulties to transform the occuring word forms on the basis of the morphological analysis carried out Varga 13 previously in such a way that the grammatical information becomes explicit and so the word forms are rendered \"agglutinative\". To find out the rection we have usually to take into consideration the following factors: a./ the category of the construing word stem; b./ the case ending of the construed word; c./ the category of the construed word stem. It is, however, u.unecessazy to consider the case","ending of the construing Word.

Consequently the problems connected with the rection Varga 14 of participle as verbal derivate may be handled separately from the problems connected with the participles as secondary parts of speech being embedded in the structure of the sentence. 5- The advantages of dependency grammars derived from the factthat they could draw conclusions with respect to the type of the relations taking no account of the arrangement of the words in the Structure of the sentence only by examining separate concrete words. With respect to some local units the same holds in the case of an IC analysis as well. Such ~ local examinations can be used as input information to further analysis, and on the other hand, ~hey may effect the reduction of the number of the possibilities to be considered. 1. A typical local problem is represented by the m6rphological analysis which means /in common parlance/ the determination of the grammatical properties of separate wor~s. 2. As local problem may be considered, for instance, the agreement of the substantive with the immediately preceding adjective/s and/or preposition in Russian. /The risk to make a mistake Varga 15 is minimal, ~ a~nougn it is no~ entirely unlikely because of the adjectives that may be used as substantives too: B CTOaOBOE ~eBy~Ee ~aa~ o6e~. Such preliminary examination of compatibility is of great impo~ance in MT because \"hereby the number of case homonymies may be reduced essentially. 3. We place the examination of the possibilities of extension or of the realization of these possibilities among the local problems, at least insofar as it provides preliminary information for the analYsis. The nu~oer of these possibilities is limited and is characteristic of the language under consideration. First, in what ~irection and second, v~hat kind of gra~natical and lexical methods may be used for the extension, the continuation of a word or structure. It is highly revealing to examine how a given structure can be extented starting from~a single sentence kernel /i.e. not from several full sentences/. So, for instance, in English~ Sometimes a decision to compute is followed by a process of selecting the particular kind of computingmachine best suited for the given problem. Varga 16 o~ The designer should be careful in choosing circuit designs that he not build in additional difficulties with a choice of a particular circuit in an attempt to eliminate other difficulties. The same grammatical relations would be expressed in Htu~garian oz in Russian in entirely different ways. /We would have full clauses instead of participles in IIungarian , in Russian the participles would be replaced by substantives derived from verbs/. 4. Semantic information may also be use~ for the reduction of the possibilities in the case of a partial analysis of ambiguous structures. /In case of no ambiguity it makes no sense to use semantic information if we assume that the input sentences ' are impeccable not only grammatically but also semantically, cf.l.2/.Notice that the constructional homonymy extending over the whole sentence is • rather unusual, we have, however, frequent cases of ambiguous structures ~ithiu sentences. So, for instance, in Russian the string ',BCXeACTBHe ~py~x BaEOHOB Co~TpaHeH~j a Ta~xe Oc06eHHOOTe~ BsaH~o~e~- CTB~S ~acTn~\" Varga 17 may have 7 different bracketings, i.e. 7 different structures. If there are several syntactically ambiguous structures in the sentence then it woul8 be unnecessary to carry out a new. syntactic analysis for each of them: if we can localize the ambiguous structure the production of all possible sentencestructures is merely a matter of combination. The mentioned local problems need not be:incorporated into the main program, i.e. the proper syntactic analysis. A considerable part of them may be carried out either previously or simultaneously with the morphological analysis, while other problems may be solve8 as subsidiary operations, in each case separately, when some rules are applied, if necessary. 6. The crucial point of the syntactic analysis of the whole sentence /i.e. not of the form of the rules, but of the strategy of their application/ is the problem where to begin the analysis, i.e. at which word of the sentence [4]. Lees says with respect to the order in which the transformational rules must be applied, that one has to begin with V arga 18 the constituent sentence that is embedded deepest anc~ that further transformations can only be applied to matrix sentences previously \"satisfied\". This holds -mutatis mutandis - with respect to the simplest structures, word groups as well. /Namely, assuming that ~,e begin with the analysis of ~ the given string to be examined,i.e.from the bottom of the tree. The other possibility is to begin from the top of presu;posed tree diagram , i.e. with the hierarchy of the given system of rules. This pathhas been followed in predictive analysis/. A basic problem is the determination of the structure that is embedde~ deepest in some other structures. If we have succeeded in determining this structure then we could obtain the analysis of rather complicated sentences by a stepwise processing of the embe~6ed structures in a rather simple way. Naturally, if it is wanted that an erroneous step should not ~estroy the whole analysis the ~ifferent possibilities must be remembered by the algorithm. A suitable algorithm worked out by B&lint Ddm~lki~5~ could be used with only slight alterations fDr the analysis meeting the above requirement. ~e can considerably diminish the number of the unne-Varga 19 eessary blind alleys by taking into consideration the type of the language huder consideration. As to Russian, for instance,the right recursive rewriting rules prevail. There is a right recursivity, for instance, in the case of substantival complements \"~ ~'\" ,a~jectives,oarticiples connected with suJstan~l~es or the participial constructions embedded in each other etc. According to Yngve's terminology we can say that a considerable part of the Russian structures are of the progressive type.As a consequence, the tree diagram of the sentence is in most cases characterized by right-branchin~ /or at least this holds for some subtrees of most structures/ In this case, however, we arrive at the deepest part of the right-branching tree in the simplest way if we begin the analysis at the end of the sentence. To put it differently, if we consider the sentence structure given by a bracket expression then in the case of progressive lan~aages we have often a ease of the brackets accumulating at the end but not at the beginning of the sentence. To take a simple example, we have in Russian such sentences as (BH (sHaeTe (MHO~O (Teope~ (o npe~ezax~)D If we began the amalysis at the beginning of the sentence, we should have to try connecting quite a I Varga 20 few words ant structures that are in fact separated by brackets, that is that are not connected with each other.
