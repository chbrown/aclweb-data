VANDENBUR.GH MORPHISM: A SYMBOLIC LIST PROCESSING LANGUAGE I ABSTRACT With the formal study of natural languages, we have obtained some residual results which greatly increase our power of logical manipulation. Coupled with a computer, our language extends enormously the external logic of our computing device. This paper is concerned with a well-defined symbolic list processing language and a set of operators for this language. These operators, which we call morphisms, are themselves operators thereby giving us an indefinite nesting ability. We have defined a schematic representation of'our operators (called a comb-scheme) and have then proceeded to describe a numbering technique which allows us to use these operators with a computer. Since our operators and lists are defined at the time of execution, our ability to change them is unlimited. The pattern of this paper is to build up from an alphabet to words, then non-connected words, then lists and the operations on lists and finally operations on the operations. We have taken, what we hope to be, descriptive examples in linguistics and non-linguistical applications in the hope of being representative of our language and easily understandable. VANDENBURGH 1. MOP,.PHISM: A SYMBOLIC LIST PROCESSING LANGUAGE Introduction We at the Facult~ des Sciences of the Umverslte de Rennes are interested in the mathematical study of languages. Since we have a computer (1620), it is only natural that we attempt to combine the two. With languages being our major interest, we find that an extensive study of lists and symbolic list processing techniques will yield a most powerful and broad spectrum of results when applied to a computer. It appears that problems involving natural languages and certain types of mathematical problems are computer solvable when list processing techniques are applied to them. There are also linguistical problems which yield beneficial results when they are approached in this manner. We are therefore going to define: lists, operations on lists (which we call morphisms), and a comb-scheme which allows us to manipulate the lists and morphisms; this scheme gives us the ability to manipulate almost any pattern that can be handled in a logical manner (in linguistic usage, the term logical will refer to letters, words, sentences, phonemes; in a predetermined or random occurrence). We have defined our operators in such a manner that we allow for an indefinite nesting; adding to a computing machine an external logical system. Also, our operators, in the computer, are defined at proces~ ing time so our ability to change them at execution time is unlimited. This paper can be considered to be divided into four sections. Part one defines our terms and gives definitions for such things as an alphabet, lists, words, non-connected words, etc. Part two defines a morphism and our operators on lists. Part three shows our comb-scheme. Part four consists of examples: in linguistics; an example in the logical generation of a flow diagram into a computer program; and finally, an example of the solution of a mathematical problem (the arithmetic operations on polynominials of n variables). VANDENBURGH 2. I. Definitions I. 1 Words and Symbols Since we are using a computer, composed of: let us define our alphabet to be the Latin capital letters the blank (#) for notational purposes but on printed page a blank. the punctuation marks . and , - the digits excluding: = - $ / + @ ( ) and 0 which is also acceptable to the computer. I. Z Non-connected words Let us put in parallel the Latin phrase: nec adulatoribus latus praebes and its French equivalent: et tune pretes pas le flanc aux flatteurs; The Latin word nec corresponds, in French, to the three nonconsecutive words e_t ... n.e ... pa_.~s and the Latin word praebes corresponds to tu ... prates Thus it appears that for the words of a language, on the same level as words, there is a series of words not necessarily consecutive: the non-connected words. For a non-connected word, the components will be separated by the symbol: - . For example: ATA - BP,_IQUE RI - DO - are non-connected words. The first has two components and the second has three components. 1. 3 Comb-scheme In the formulas, as in algebra, we designate a variable by x (and , eventually intervening variables by Xl, x 2''\" ); a non-connected word of N components will be schematized by a comb or comb - scheme VANDENBURGH 3.

The list is: A-B /C /D-E-F. It should be mentioned that a list can be recursive: it may contain a list (i.e. the name of the list enclosed in @ signs which, of course, refers to another list). A type of list will be indicated, not by a series of combs which are not part of a keyboard; but by the particular list of the type where all of its components are empty; enclosed by two @ signs.

In a like manner, we will use the notation - to show the insertion of a word (or list) into another list.

Z List ordering and comb scheme constructio n Let us consider the following French sentence. je ne veux pa_._~s.

It should be clear that since the first line of the schematic represents a list, the morphism can operate on any list of this type. Thus, the list: A-B /C-D/E/F AECEBEDF will become The morphism conserves in each non-connected word the order of its components ( JE preceeds VEUX, etc. ). This is a condition we may or may not impose on a morphism. If we impose it, we are saying that it is forbidden to cross the teeth of the combs.

We have therefore designed the following type of numbering system for our morphisrns. We will define a morphism by a symbol (set of letters and digits). We shall p1\"ecede this symbol by the sign $. For example: $ PSI will designate a morphism. Let @A @ be a list of the source type of $ PSI; the resultant list of @ A @ transformed by the morphism will have the following notation: $ PSI ( @A @).

Practical application of symbolic list p.roces.sing ' 3. i Introduction The actual programming of a symbolic list processing system presents many interesting and varied problems and possibilities. The power of this type of list manipulation opens the way to many hitherto unsolvable (computer-wise)problems. Now that we have defined our language, it naturally behooves us to ask how, and to what, we can apply it. We are going to illustrate three different types of problems to show that we have a general purpose language. The first will be a simple example of list processing manipulating variables in algebra. The second will be an application of morphisms to generate FOP~TRAN (or any symbolic programming system) in the same general manner of SHADOW but with the added difference that our input is a list instead of a single variable. The third example will be an application to the natural languages. 3. 2 Operating on polynominials using"]},{"title":"symbolic","paragraphs":["list processing We have written a program for the 1620 computer in FORTRAN which allows us to operate on sets of polymminials of N variables varied to a power p. The only limitation being that of memory size i. e. N p size of memory. If we consider an external memory source such as tapes or discs this does not become much of a limitation. The operations we are treating at present are addition, subtraction, multiplication and raising to a power. We are considering the differenciation but that we will leave to a later date. Mathematically expressed, we are doing the following: Let PI(Xl, X Z ..... XN) and Pz(XI, XZ, ..... XN) be polynominials when the variables can be raised to the j power and all combinations. An example will clarify this section. Let: P1 PZ","3 2 3 = X + 5X 6X + i + Y - CY + 4XY = -3Y 2 6X2y + X VANDENB URGH Z0.","2 We are able to compute Pl ~:= PZ' P1 + P2 ' and any combination of these pclynominials. It turns out that this can be handled ve~.y easily as a function of lists. Our limitations, at Rennes, being simply memory size as we need to set up tables for the coefficients anu the 16Z0 is rather limited in memory capacity and lists are very heavy users of tables. This limitation would be relatively nil, if we had an external memory device such as discs or tapes. 3.3 Generating computes.programs from flow charts. A practical application of the nnorphisms is the translation of flowcharts into programs. This section is therefore concerned with that problem. A typical flowcharting or programming problem.

This will cause an IF( to be generated. We follow this by the entry in the list (in our case Y-YMAX). This is followed by a right paranthesis. The FORTRAN statement numbers are respectively the corresponding entry for ]5 taken twice (separated by commas) and the value of i+l. This is true because all orders following an IF must have a path so they must be numbered i.e. carry a statement number. 3. 8 Advantages and power of symbolic list processing with morphisms With the example shown here, the real power does not come to light. However, there are some things we can do here. We can take advantage of inserts. We can insert elements into our list by adding an element to the end of the list and for putting a dash in the list; or we can even insert VANDENBURGH Z4. a list /s within our original list by inserting the name of a new list /s enclosed in two @ signs. It should also be mentioned here that it is not necessary to punch redundant coding in the above example. It suffices simply to add the number of the element to the morphisrn list. For instance in our example if we wanted to do another series of calculations over the same range, we need only punch a new entry for Z (or some other variable with another symbolic name) and repeat the tables. With a little imagination, it is easy to see that if we can generate an IF statement, we can search to find out if our variable starts with the letters i, j, k, i, m, or n and generate a DO statement. Unfortunately, this, despite IBM's claim of FORTRAN's compatibility between machines, creates the problem of being machine oriented e.g. the 704/7090 etc. permit a DO loop to have a maximum value of 3Z, 767 while the decimal machines will easily accept 99,999. We could also attack the logical schematic of a flowchart with IF statements but this poses to the problem of ordinary usage and becomes completely computer oriented. For example, we can generate a statement of the following type:"]},{"title":"(i) IF ( ) ~<, ~, (Z) IF ( ) ~ , ~,0< (3) IF ( )o~ , ~ , \"~","paragraphs":["Which pattern shall we select?
