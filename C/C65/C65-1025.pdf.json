A remarkable regularity of distribution of Arabic verbal roots in the vocabulary is shown to exist. Presented results sugsest that similar resular distributions of semantic units in other languages may be found with the help of word formation rules and vocabulary statistics. Possible applications in approaching the problem of \"true\" multiple meaning in MT are being discussed. The notion of \"semantic unit\" may be formulated in several ways /I/ so that the application of this term makes its explicit definition indispensable.

Given a generative descrlptional device G z~rammar/ and a pro-Jective system of the type proposed by Katz and Fodor S /sem~ntics/ we can describe a semantic concept in a lan~ua~'e L as a set of n-tuples of symbols from G and S~ ordered or partially ordered by the relations which define the formal rules of these systems~ and having a common derivation in S.
