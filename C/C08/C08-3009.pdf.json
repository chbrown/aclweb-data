This research has developed a new system for the first time of its kind for Shahmukhi text without diacritical marks.

The corpus analysis of both scripts is performed for generating statistical data of different types like character and word frequencies and bi-gram frequencies. This statistical analysis is used in different phases of transliteration.

South Asia is one of those unique parts of the world where a single language is written in different scripts. This is the case, for example, with Punjabi language, spoken by tens of millions of people, but written in Indian East Punjab (20 million) in Gurmukhi script (a Left to Right script based on Devanagari) and in Pakistani West Punjab (80 million), written in Shahmukhi script (a Right to Left script based on Arabic), and by growing number of Punjabis (2 million) in the EU and the US in the Roman script.

Western parts is mutually comprehensible, in the written form it is not so. The existence of two scripts for Punjabi has created a script barrier between the Punjabi literature written in India and Pakistan. More than 60 per cent of Punjabi literature of medieval period (500-1450 AD) is available in Shahmukhi script only, while most of the modern Punjabi writings are in Gurmukhi. Potentially, all members of the substantial Punjabi community will benefit vastly from this transliteration system. 1.1 Gurmukhi Script The Gurmukhi script, derived from the Sharada script and standardised by Guru Angad Dev in the 16th century, was designed to write the Punjabi language. The meaning of \"Gurmukhi\" is literally “from the mouth of the Guru\". The Gurmukhi script has forty one letters, including thirty eight consonants and three basic vowel sign bearers. There are five nasal consonants (ਙ, ਞ, ਣ, ਨ, ਮ) and two additional nasalization signs, bindi ◌ਂ [ɲ] and tippi ◌ੰ [ɲ]. In addition to this, there are nine dependent vowel signs (◌ੁ[ʊ], ◌ੂ [u], ◌ੋ[o], ◌ਾ[ɘ], ਿ◌[ɪ], ◌ੀ[i], ◌ੇ[e], ◌ੈ[æ], ◌ੌ[Ɔ]) used to create ten independent vowels with three bearer characters: Ura ੳ[ʊ], Aira ਅ [ə] and Iri ੲ[ɪ]. 1.2 Shahmukhi Script","The meaning of \"Shahmukhi\" is literally “from the King's mouth\". Shahmukhi is a local variant of the Urdu script used to record the Punjabi language. It is based on right to left Nastalique style of the Persian and Arabic script. It has thirty seven simple consonants, eleven frequently used aspirated consonants, four long vowels and three short vowel symbols (Malik 2006). 177"]},{"title":"2 Comparison with the Existing System","paragraphs":["In actual practice, Shahmukhi script is written without short vowels and other diacritical marks.

Arabic orthography does not provide full vocalization of the text, and the reader is expected to infer short vowels from the context of the sentence. In the written Shahmukhi script it is not mandatory to put short vowels below or above the Shahmukhi character to clear its sound. These special signs are called \"Aerab\" in Urdu. It is a big challenge in the process of machine transliteration to recognize the right word from the written text. 3.2 Multiple Mappings It is observed that there is multiple possible mapping in Gurmukhi script corresponding to a single character in the Shahmukhi script as shown in Table 3.

The first phase performs pre-processing on the input Shahmukhi token by performing dictionary lookup. If the dictionary lookup fails then the token will go for rule based transliteration and ultimately this phase will generate best possible Gurmukhi token(s). The second phase performs 178 the task of post-processing. Unicode Alignment component performs context analysis of input Gurmukhi token(s). All Forms generator (AFG) component will perform critical task of handling missing diacritical marks. This component will suggest similar possible forms of a Gurmukhi token which is not most frequent one. The queue manager of post-processing phase is designed to work on bi-gram language model. This will select the best possible unigram for final output by consulting bi-gram weights of the current token with its neighboring tokens Figure 1.

Post-Processing Status and output Here, we see that the AFG has generated two additional forms ਅਜੇਹੀ{310} ਅਿਜਹੀ{1486} (table 5) for this token. These new forms are having additional diacritical marks of short vowels those are missing in the original form. Clearly, AFG has supplied the best possible forms. Next, we show how bi-gram manager will work on WGF tokens to generate final Gurmukhi token. In this model the next token will decide the selection of its previous one. Consider the case of second WFG token ਹੋਰ{14054} having bi-gram combinations with previous one as ਫੇਰ-ਹੋਰ with weight 12 and ਿਫਰ-ਹੋਰ with weight 20. Clearly, the token ਿਫਰ will produce as output not ਫੇਰ because ਿਫਰ-ਹੋਰ combination has higher weight than ਫੇਰ-ਹੋਰ. Similarly, this table shows found bi-gram weights and correspondingly decided Gurmukhi token as output. 7 Results and Discussion The transliteration system was tested on a small set of poetry, article and story. The results are tabulated in Table 6. As we can observe an average transliteration accuracy of 91.37% has been obtained. We got good transliteration with different inputs. The main source of error is the existence of vowel-consonant mapping between the two scripts. The Shahmukhi vowel characters Vav(و) and Yeh(ی) have mapping into Gurmukhi consonants Vava(ਵ) and Ya(ਯ) respectively. This kind of vowel-consonant mapping can not be resolved fully with dependency rules but can be minimized by refining the dictionary and phonetic code generation rules of AFG component. In other cases, system makes errors showing deficiency in handling those tokens which are not belonging to common vocabulary domain.
