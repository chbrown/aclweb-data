Given two bilingual lexicons between language pairs Lf –Lp and Lp–Le, we assume these lexicons as parallel corpora. Then, we merge the extracted two phrase tables into one phrase table between Lf and Le. Finally, we construct a phrase-based SMT system for translating the terms in the lexicon Lf –Lp into terms of Le and, obtain a new lexicon Lf –Le. In our experiments with Chinese-English and Japanese-English lexicons, our system could cover 72.8% of Chinese terms and drastically improve the utilization ratio."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The bilingual lexicon is a crucial resource for multilingual applications in natural language process-ing including machine translation (Brown et al., 1990) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999). A number of bilingual lexicons have been constructed manually, despite their expensive compilation costs. However, it is unrealistic to build a bilingual lexicon for every language pair; thus, comprehensible bilingual lexicons are available only for a limited number of language pairs.","One of the solutions is to build a bilingual lexicon of the source language Lf and the target Le through a pivot language Lp, when large bilingual","c⃝ 2008.

Numerous researchers have explored the use of pivot languages (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). This approach is advantageous because we can obtain a bilingual lexicon between Le and Lf ,evenifno bilingual lexicon exists between these languages.","Pivot-based methods for dictionary construction may produce incorrect translations when the word we is translated from a word wf by a polysemous pivot word wp1",". Previous work addressed the polysemy problem in pivot-based methods (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002). Pivot-based methods also suffer from a mismatch problem, in which a pivot word wp from a source word wf does not exist in the bilingual lexicon Lp– Le2",". Moreover, a bilingual lexicon for technical terms is prone to include a number of pivot terms that are not included in another lexicon.","This paper proposes a method for building a bilingual lexicon through a pivot language by using phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003). We build a translation model between Lf and Le by assuming two lexicons Lf –Lp and Lp–Le as parallel corpora, in order to increase the obtained lexicon size by handling multi-word expressions appropriately. The main advantage of this method is its ability to in-corporate various translation models that associate languages Lf –Le; for example, we can further improve the translation model by integrating a small bilingual lexicon Lf –Le.","1","A Japanese term “”: dote, embankment, may be as-sociated with a Chinese term “,” yı́ngháng: banking in-stitution, using the pivot word bank in English.","2","It is impossible to associate two translation pairs (“ (chikyū-ondanka),” global warming), and (global heat-ing, “ (quánqiú-biànnuăn)”) because of the differ-ence in English (pivot) terms. 127 Lf-Lp lexicon Le-Lp lexicon","Lf-Lp translation phrase table","Le-Lp translation phrase table Lf-Le translation phrase table Phrase-based SMT system","Word alignment & grow-diag-final method Merging phrase tables Additional features INPUT OUTPUT","Le: translations of Lf-Lp lexicon Figure 1: Framework of our approach"]},{"title":"2 Merging two bilingual lexicons","paragraphs":["We introduce phrase-based SMT for merging the lexicons, in order to improve both the merged lexicon size and its accuracy. Recently, several researchers proposed the use of the pivot language for phrase-based SMT (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007). We employ a similar approach for obtaining phrase translations with the translation probabilities by assuming the bilingual lexicons as parallel corpora. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of our approach.","Let us suppose that we have two bilingual lexicons Lf –Lp and Lp–Le. We obtain word alignments of these lexicons by applying GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), and grow-diag-final heuristics (Koehn et al., 2007). Let w̄x be a phrase that represents a sequence of words in the language Lx. For phrase pairs (w̄p, w̄f ) and (w̄e, w̄p), the translation probabilities p(w̄p| w̄f ) and p(w̄e| w̄p) are computed using the maximum likelihood estimation from the co-occurrence frequencies, consistent with the word alignment in the bilingual lexicons. We calculate the direct translation probabilities between source and target phrases, p(w̄e| w̄f )=","∑ w̄p p(w̄e| w̄p)p(w̄p| w̄f )","∑ w̄′ e","∑ w̄p p(w̄′","e| w̄p)p(w̄p| w̄f ) .

We define a character-based similarity feature, hchar sim(w̄e, w̄f )=1− ED( w̄e, w̄f ) max( w̄e, w̄f ) , (3) where ED(x, y) represents a Levenshtein distance of characters between the two terms x and y3",".We also define an additional bilingual lexicon feature, hadd lex(w̄e, w̄f )=∑ i","log p′ (w̄(i)","e | w̄ (i) f ), (4) where w̄ (i) e and w̄ (i) f represent an i-th translated","phrase pair on the term pair (w̄e, w̄f ) during the","decoding, and p′ (w̄(i)","e | w̄ (i) f ) represents the phrase","translation probabilities derived from the addi-","tional lexicon.

For comparison, we prepared two baseline systems for building Chinese-Japanese lexicons. Exact matching connects source and target terms that share at least one common translation term in the pivot language. Unique matching is an extreme approach for avoiding negative effects of polysemous pivot terms: it connects source and target terms if source, pivot, and target terms appear only once in the corresponding lexicons.","Exact matching achieved 26.2% of the utilization ratio in Japanese-to-Chinese translation, and 22.2% in Chinese-to-Japanese translation. These figures imply that about 75% of the terms remained unused in building the Japanese-Chinese lexicon. With unique matching, as little as 1% of Japanese and Chinese terms could be used. In contrast, our method could cover 72.8% of Chinese terms by generating Japanese terms, which was a drastic improvement in the utilization ratio.","3.3 Generating Japanese translations of the Chinese-English lexicon For evaluating the correctness of the merged lexicons, we assumed the lexicon generated by the unique matching as a development/test set. Development and test sets consist of about 2,400 term pairs, respectively. Next, we input Chinese terms in the development/test set into our system based on Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and obtained the Japanese translations. We evaluated the performance by using BLEU, NIST, and accuracy measures. Table 2 shows the evaluation results on the test set. Our system could output correct translations for 68.5% of 500 input terms. The table also reports that additional features were effective in improving the performance.","We also conducted another experiment to generate Japanese translations for Chinese terms included in an external resource.

Table 3 shows that our system outperformed the English-to-Japanese direct translation system.","Table 4 displays translation examples. The first example shows that our system could output a correct translation (denoted by [T]); and the E-to-J system failed to translate the source term ([F]), because it could not reorder the source English words and translate the word pubis correctly. In the second example, our system could reproduce Chinese characters “ (fluid)”, but the E-to-J system output a semantically acceptable but awkward Japanese term. In the last example, the word segmentation of the source Chinese term was incorrect (“ (lumber) (lymph) ” is correct). Thus, our system received an invalid word “ ” and could not find a translation for the word. 11 http://www.eijiro.jp/ 129 English Chinese Japanese (Eijiro) Japanese (C-to-J) Japanese (E-to-J) symphysis pubis [T] (symphysis shame) [F] ideal fluid dynamics   [T] (fluid) [F] intermediate lumbar lymph nodes  ","(intermediate node [lumbarlymph]INVALID) [F] [T] Table 4: Translation examples on Eijiro dictionary"]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposed a novel method for building a bilingual lexicon by using a pivot language.
