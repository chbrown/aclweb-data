As a derivation of the forest reranking for parsing (Huang, 2008), this strategy reranks on the pruned word lattice, which potentially contains much more candidates while using less storage, compared with the traditional n-best list reranking. With a perceptron classifier trained with local features as the baseline, word lattice reranking performs reranking with non-local features that can’t be easily incorporated into the perceptron baseline. Experimental results show that, this strategy achieves improvement on both segmentation and POS tagging, above the perceptron baseline and the n-best list reranking."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent work for Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging pays much attention to discriminative methods, such as Maximum Entropy Model (ME) (Ratnaparkhi and Adwait, 1996), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), perceptron training algorithm (Collins, 2002), etc. Compared to generative ones such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989; Fine et al., 1998), discriminative models have the advantage of flexibility in representing features, and usually obtains almost perfect accuracy in two tasks.","Originated by Xue and Shen (2003), the typical approach of discriminative models conducts","c⃝ 2008.

If we extend these positional tags to include POS information, segmentation and POS tagging can be performed by a single pass under a unify classification framework (Ng and Low, 2004). In the rest of the paper, we call this operation mode Joint S&T. Experiments of Ng and Low (2004) shown that, compared with performing segmentation and POS tagging one at a time, Joint S&T can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on POS tagging.","Besides the usual local features such as the character-based ones (Xue and Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004), many non-local features related to POSs or words can also be employed to improve performance. However, as such features are generated dynamically during the decoding procedure, incorporating these features directly into the classifier results in problems. First, the classifier’s feature space will grow much rapidly, which is apt to overfit on training corpus. Second, the variance of non-local features caused by the model evolution during the training procedure will hurt the parameter tuning. Last but not the lest, since the current predication relies on the results of prior predications, exact inference by dynamic programming can’t be obtained, and then we have to maintain a n-best candidate list at each considering position, which also evokes the potential risk of depress-ing the parameter tuning procedure. As a result, many theoretically useful features such as higher-order word- or POS- grams can not be utilized efficiently.","A widely used approach of using non-local features is the well-known reranking technique, which has been proved effective in many NLP tasks, for instance, syntactic parsing and machine 385"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["0"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["2"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["3"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["4"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["5"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["6"]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["7"]},{"title":"C","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["2"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["3"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["4"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["5"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["6"]},{"title":": C","paragraphs":["7"]},{"title":": NN VV NN MNN NN NN NN VV NN NN","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Pruned word lattice as directed graph.

Suppose the word lattice is for sentence C1:n = C1..Cn, node vi ∈ V (i = 1..n − 1) denotes the position between Ci and Ci+1, while v0 before C1 is the source node, and vn after Cn is the sink node. An edge e ∈ E departs from vb and arrives at ve (0 ≤ b < e ≤ n), it covers a subsequence of C1:n, which is recognized as a possible word. Considering Joint S&T, we label each edge a POS tag to represent a word-POS pair. A series of adjoining edges forms a path, and a path connecting the source node and the sink node is called diameter, which indicates a specific pattern of segmentation and POS tagging. For a diameter d, |d| denotes the length of d, which is the count of edges contained in this diameter.

The classifier conducts decoding by considering each character in a left-to-right fashion. At each considering position i, the classifier enumerates all candidate results for subsequence C1:i, by attaching each current candidate word-POS pair p to the tail of each candidate result at p’s prior position, as the endmost of the new generated candidate. We give each p a score, which is the highest, among all C1:i’s candidates that have p as their endmost. Then we select N word-POS pairs with the high-est scores, and insert them to the lattice’s edge set. This approach of selecting edges implies that, for the lattice’s node set, we generate a node vi at each position i.

Following usual practice in parsing, the first feature f1(y) is specified as the score outputted by the baseline classifier, and its value is a real number. The other features are non-local ones such as word- and POS- n-grams extracted from candidates in n-best list (for n-best reranking) or diameters (for word lattice reranking), and they are 0 − 1 valued. 3.1 Training of the Reranker We adopt the perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) to train the reranker. as shown in Algorithm 3. We use a simple refinement strategy of “averaged parameters” of Collins (2002) to alleviate overfitting on the training corpus and obtain more stable performance.","For every training example {cand(si), y∗","i }, y∗","i denotes the best candidate in cand(si).

Notice that all features generated from these templates don’t contain “future” words or POS tags, it means that we only use current or history word- or POS- n-grams to evaluate the current considering word-POS pair. Although it is possible to use “future” information in n-best list reranking, it’s not the same when we rerank the pruned word lattice. As we have to traverse the lattice topologically, we face difficulty in Algorithm 4 Cube pruning for non-local features. 1: function CUBE(L) 2: for v ∈ L · V in topological order do 3: NBEST(v) 4: return Dv","sink[1] 5: procedure NBEST(v) 6: heap ← ∅ 7: for v′","topologically before v do 8: ∆ ← all edges from v′","to v 9: p ← ⟨Dv′",", ∆⟩ 10: ⟨p, 1⟩·score ← Eval(p, 1) 11: PUSH(⟨p, 1⟩, heap) 12: HEAPIFY(heap) 13: buf ← ∅ 14: while |heap| > 0 and |buf| < N do 15: item ← POP-MAX(heap) 16: append item to buf 17: PUSHSUCC(item, heap) 18: sort buf to Dv 19: procedure PUSHSUCC(⟨p, j⟩, heap) 20: p is ⟨vec1, vec2⟩ 21: for i ← 1..2 do 22: j′","← j + bi 23: if |veci| ≥ j′","i then 24: ⟨p, j′","⟩·score ← Eval(p, j′",") 25: PUSH(⟨p, j′","⟩, heap) utilizing the information ahead of the current considering node. 3.3 Reranking by Cube Pruning Because of the non-local features such as word-and POS- n-grams, the reranking procedure is similar to machine translation decoding with intergrated language models, and should maintain a list of N best candidates at each node of the lattice. To speed up the procedure of obtaining the N best candidates, following Huang (2008, Sec. 3.3), we adapt the cube pruning method from machine translation (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang 2007) which is based on efficient k-best parsing algorithms (Huang and Chiang, 2005).","As shown in Algorithm 4, cube pruning works topologically in the pruned word lattice, and maintains a list of N best derivations at each node. When deducing a new derivation by attaching a current word-POS pair to the tail of a antecedent derivation, a function Eval is used to compute the new derivation’s score (line 10 and 24). We use a max-heap heap to hold the candidates for the next-best derivation. Line 7 − 11 initialize heap to the set of top derivations along each deducing source, the vector pair ⟨Dvhead, ∆⟩.Here, ∆ denotes the vector of current word-POS pairs, while Dvhead denotes the vector of N best derivations at ∆’s antecedent node.

(2008), we describe segmentation and Joint S&T as below:","For a given Chinese sentence appearing as a character sequence:","C1:n = C1 C2 .. Cn the goal of segmentation is splitting the sequence into several subsequences:","C1:e1 Ce1+1:e2 .. Cem−1+1:em While in Joint S&T, each of these subsequences is labelled a POS tag:","C1:e1 /t1 Ce1+1:e2 /t2 .. Cem−1+1:em /tm Where Ci(i = 1..n) denotes a character, Cl:r(l ≤ r) denotes the subsequence ranging from Cl to Cr, and ti(i = 1..m, m ≤ n) denotes the POS tag of Cei−1+1:ei.","If we label each character a positional tag indicating its relative position in an expected subsequence, we can obtain the segmentation result accordingly. As described in Ng and Low (2004) and Jiang et al. (2008), we use s indicating a single-character word, while b, m and e indicating the be-gin, middle and end of a word respectively. With these positional tags, the segmentation transforms to a classification problem. For Joint S&T, we expand positional tags by attaching POS to their tails as postfix. As each tag now contains both positional- and POS- information, Joint S&T can also be resolved in a classification style framework. It means that, a subsequence is a word with POS t, only if the positional part of the tag sequence conforms to s or bm∗","e pattern, and each element in the POS part equals to t. For example, a tag sequence b N N m N N e N N represents a three-character word with POS tag N N . 4.2 Feature Templates The features we use to build the classifier are generated from the templates of Ng and Low (2004). For convenience of comparing with other, they didn’t adopt the ones containing external knowl-edge, such as punctuation information. All their templates are shown in Table 2. C denotes a character, while its subscript indicates its position relative to the current considering character(it has the subscript 0).","The table’s upper column lists the templates that immediately from Ng and Low (2004). they named these templates non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate with-out considering the current character C0. Templates called lexical-target in the column below are introduced by Jiang et al. (2008). They are generated by adding an additional field C0 to each nonlexical-target template, so they can carry out predication not only according to the context, but also according to the current character itself.","Notice that features derived from the templates in Table 2 are all local features, which means all features are determined only by the training instances, and they can be generated before the training procedure. 389 Algorithm 5 Perceptron training algorithm. 1: Input: Training examples (xi, yi) 2: α ← 0 3: for t ← 1 ..

Figure 2 shows the learning curves for segmentation and Joint S&T on the development set. We choose the averaged parameter vector after 7 iterations for the final test, this parameter vector achieves an F-measure of 0.973 on segmentation, and 0.925 on Joint S&T.

Experiments of Ng and Low (2004) on CTB 3.0 also shown the similar trend, where they obtained F-measure 0.952 on segmentation, and 0.919 on Joint S&T. 5.2 Preparation for Reranking For n-best reranking, we can easily generate n best results for every training instance, by a modifica-tion for the baseline classifier to hold n best candidates at each considering point. For word lattice reranking, we use the algorithm in Algorithm 2 to generate the pruned word lattice. Given a training instance si, its n best result list or pruned word lattice is used as a reranking instance cand(si), the best candidate result (of the n best list) or oracle diameter (of the pruned word lattice) is the reranking target y∗","i . We find the best result of the n best results simply by computing each result’s 390 F-measure, and we determine the oracle diameter of the pruned word lattice using the algorithm depicted in Algorithm 1. All pairs of cand(si) and y∗","i deduced from the baseline model’s training instances comprise the training set for reranking.

We use the oracle F-measure indicating the utmost improvement that an reranking algorithm can achieve. 5.3 Results and Analysis The flows of the n-best list reranking and the pruned word lattice reranking are similar to the training procedure for the baseline classifier. The training set for reranking is used to tune the parameter vector of the reranker, while the development set for reranking is used to determine the optimal number of iterations for the reranker’s training procedure.","We compare the performance of the word lattice reranking against the n-best list reranking. Table 3 shows the experimental results. The upper four rows are the experimental results for n-best list reranking, while the four rows below are for word lattice reranking. In n-best list reranking, with list size 20, the oracle F-measure on Joint S&T is 0.9455, and the reranked F-measure is 0.9280. When list size grows up to 50, the oracle F-measure on Joint S&T jumps to 0.9552, while the reranked F-measure becomes 0.9302. However, when n grows to 100, it brings tiny improvement over the situation of n = 50. In word lattice reranking, there is a trend similar to that in n-best reranking, the performance difference between in degree = 2 and in degree = 5 is obvious, whereas the setting in degree = 10 does not obtain a notable improvement over the performance of in degree = 5. We also notice that even with a relative small in degree limitation, such as in degree = 5, the oracle F-measures for segmentation and Joint S&T both reach a quite high level. This indicates the pruned word lattice contains much more possibilities of segmentation and tagging, compared to n-best list.","With the setting in degree = 5, the oracle F-measure on Joint S&T reaches 0.9774, and the reranked F-measure climbs to 0.9336.

While for n-best reranking with setting n = 50, the Joint S&T’s error reduction is 6.9% , and the segmentation’s error reduction is 8.9%. We can see that reranking on pruned word lattice is a practical method for segmentation and POS tagging. Even with a much small data representation, it obtains obvious advantage over the n-best list reranking.","Comparing between the baseline and the two reranking techniques, We find the non-local information such as word- or POS- grams do improve accuracy of segmentation and POS tagging, and we also find the reranking technique is effective to utilize these kinds of information. As even a small scale n-best list or pruned word lattice can achieve a rather high oracle F-measure, reranking technique, especially the word lattice reranking would be a promising refining strategy for segmentation and POS tagging. This is based on this viewpoint: On the one hand, compared with the initial input character sequence, the pruned word lattice has a quite smaller search space while with a high oracle F-measure, which enables us to conduct more precise reranking over this search space to find the best result. On the other hand, as the structure of the search space is approximately outlined by the topological directed architecture of pruned word lattice, we have a much wider choice for feature selection, which means that we would be able to utilize not only features topologically before the current considering position, just like those depicted in Table 2 in section 4, but also information topologically after it, for example the next word W1 or the next POS tag T1. We believe the pruned word 391 lattice reranking technique will obtain higher improvement, if we develop more precise reranking algorithm and more appropriate features."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper describes a reranking strategy called word lattice reranking. As a derivation of the forest reranking of Huang (2008), it performs reranking on pruned word lattice, instead of on n-best list. Using word- and POS- gram information, this reranking technique achieves an error reduction of 16.3% on Joint S&T, and 11.9% on segmentation, over the baseline classifier, and it also outperforms reranking on n-best list. It confirms that word lattice reranking can effectively use non-local information to select the best candidate result, from a relative small representation structure while with a quite high oracle F-measure. However, our reranking implementation is relative coarse, and it must have many chances for improvement. In future work, we will develop more precise pruning algorithm for word lattice generation, to further cut down the search space while maintaining the oracle F-measure. We will also investigate the feature selection strategy under the word lattice architecture, for effective use of non-local information."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Contracts 60736014 and 60573188, and 863 State Key Project No. 2006AA010108.
