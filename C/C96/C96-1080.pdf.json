We discuss below some of the problems encountered in tagging and their resolu-tion."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["COMLEX Syntax is a moderately-broad-coverage English lexicon (with about 38,000 root; forms) developed at New York University under contract to the Linguistic Data Consortium; the first version of the lexicon was delivered in May 1994. The tagged version was delivered in August 1995. The h;xicon is available to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium for both research and commercial applications. It was developed specifically for use in processing natural language by computer.","COMLEX Syntax is particularly detailed in its treatment of subeategorization (cotnplement structures). It includes 92 different subcategoriza-tion features for verbs, 14 for adjectives, and 9 for nouns. These distinguish not only the (lifterent constituent structures which may appear in a complement, but also the different control features associated with a constituent structure.","In order to make this dictionary useful to the entire Natural Language Processing coinmunity, an effort was made to provide detailed yet the-ory neutral syntactic information. In part, this involved using categories that are generally recognized, i.e. norms, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, adverbs, and their corresponding phrasal expansions np, vp, adjp, pp, advp. COMLEX cites the specific: prepositions and adverbs hi prepositional anti particle phrases associated with particular verbs. 1","As a starting point, the classes for complements and features developed by the New York University Linguistic String Project (LSP) (Fitzpatrick, 1981), were selected sin(x, the coverage is very broad and the classes well defined. These classes were augmented and flnther refined by studying the coding employed by several other major lexicons used for automated language analysis. The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) (Hornby, 1980), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor, 1978), the verb (:odes developed for English by Sanfilippo as part of the ACQUILEX project(Sanfilippo, 1992), and The Brandeis Verb Lexicon 2 were consulted. A Brandeis-like notation was adopted for COM-I,EX complement naines. The Brandeis notation is compositional, consisting of lists of elements joined by hyphens e.g. pl-ing-sc (preposi-tion \"about\" followed by a gerund where tile matrix subject is the subject of the gerund e.g. \"he lied about going\"). In adapting this notation for COMLEX, the list of complement nmnes became fixed and a separate explicit definition of tile syntactic structure associated with each complement name was provided. I,hrther information on these classes and definitions can be found in the Reference Manual (Macleod, 1993) and the COMLEX Word Classes Manual (Wolff', 1995)."]},{"title":"2 Tagging Task","paragraphs":["We tagged 100 exmnples for each of 750 common verbs which had previously been entered in the COMLEX lexicon. These tags, which becmne part of the dictionary entry, contain tile location of the example and the name of the w~'rbal complement identified at that location (see figure 1 for a sample 1e.g. pp :pval \"to\" for he went to the party; part-np",":adval \"up\" for he woke up the child. ~Developed by J.

We felt these cases to be different from the other cases that we have discussed above not only because of the difficulty of locating the complement but in the nature of the construction. This construction is more similar, in fact, to COMLEX's V-SAY feature which allows a verb like \"say\" to occur in sentence adjunct positions without its complement, s (16) He said, \"I want to see you.\" (17) \"I\", he said, \"want to see you.\" (18) \"I want\", he said, \"to see you.\" (19) \"I want to see you,\" he said. Therefore, we concluded that the fact that these verbs can occur without their complements is a fact about the graminar of parentheticals. These examples, then, have been tagged as \"parenthetical\" and the new COMLEX feature PAREN-THETICAL has been given to the verbs which can occur in parentimtical constructions. 6 The \"Intransitive\" Question We have encountered several types of zeroing in the corpus which occur with verbs which we would normally consider transitive (~ or verbs which can be intransitive only under special circumstances. For example, in isolation, \"agree\" may not occur intransitively unless it has a plural subject (COMLEX intrans-recip class). 7 (20) he agreed with her. (21) they agreed. (with each other) ~Examples not from the corpus. aNote, that while ibr some \"transitive\" verbs are defined only as verbs which take NP complements, we consider verbs \"transitive\" that take any type of complement, including PPs 7These examples are not from the corpus 474 (22) *he agreed.","However, the data is rife with examples of intransitive '!agree\" occurring with a singular subjeer as seen by the following examlfles.","(23) the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners, the girl reluctantly AGREED.","(24) Why, it's all right, isn't it, Mother\"7 Her woolly-minded parent AGREED \"Of course, dear\", she said. \"It's only that I like to know where you go\".","(25) \"He's one hell of a decent boy.

A number of verbs take very particular noun phrases. Verbs like \"increase\", \"decrease\" and \"expand\" take complement groups which require a noun with the subclass NUNIT. ~2 These verbs occurred t)redoIninately in environments like The price increased 5 to :tO percent. The price increased 5 dollars a share. We decided not to make this a separate NP coniplement for several reasons: (1) these verl)s also take regular NP complements, though in some instances (as in the below example) the meaning of the verb changc.s. As COMLEX does not sense disambiguate the semantic difference does not af~ feet the dictionary entry. \"Those vitamins increased his appetite.\" (2)the NUNITPs are not syntacticly distinguished; other nouns occur with similar structures. \"He ate 5 to :tO pickles (a day).\"","On the other hand, the increase-type verbs can appear with a whole range of nunitp comt)lements (cornpleinents which contain an nunitp 1at: The price increased (5Z) to $10 (a share). The price increased (SY,) from $10 (a share). The price increased from $10 (a share) to $30 (a share). The price increased to 30 dollars from i0 dollars. The price increased by 5Z to end at $i00. whereas verbs like \"eat\" can not *He ate to/from 10 pickles. *He ate by 10~ to 20 pickles (a day). Mthough we decided not to add NUNITP as a separate NP complement, we have let the NUNITP tags for verb complements remain, to reflect the information that in our corpus this type","t~These art'. nouns which can appear in quantifier phrases including a scalar adjectiw~ before another noun o1 as a head noun tollowed by a prel)ositional phrase containing a scalar mmn (a two FOOT long board/a board two FEET in length).","laThe nunitp is S/dollars in the examples of verb occurs almost exclusively with this type of NP.
