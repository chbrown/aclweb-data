The assumption that \"translations of two co-occurring words in a source language also co-occur in the target language\" is adopted and represented in the stochastic matrix formulation. The translation matrix provides the co-occurring information translated from the source into the target. This translated co-occurring information should resemble that of the original in the target when the ambiguity of the translational relation is resolved. An algorithm to obtain the best translation matrix is introduced. Some experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ambiguity resolution and the refinement of the dictionary. 1 Introduction Alignment of corpora is now being actively studied to support example-based automatic translation and dictionary refinement. Focusing on the latter, in order to obtain lexical translations, the maximum likelihood method is applied to roughly aligned corpus. One of the problems of this method is that it needs a large amount of aligned corpus for training (Brown, 1993).","When it exists, a qualified dictionary is also likely to exist, because it should have been created and used when the corpus in the source language was translated by hand to make the aligned corpus. There are few requirements to improve dictionaries in such a case. On the other hand, when a large amount of aligned corpus does not exist but only two independent corpora do, for example, the corpora between two 'not so international'","*Author's current address: Department of Computer Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. 2-24-16 Naka-machi, Koganei, Tokyo 184 JAPAN. languages or those in a constrained domain, the low quality dictionaries need to be improved.","To make a new dictionary between two uncommon languages, it is often necessary to transform published dictionaries, one between the source and the international language, the other between the international and the target language. The problem in this process is to eliminate the irrelevant translations introduced by words with ambiguous meanings (Tanaka, 1994).","This carl be thought of as choosing the translations from several candidates without aligned corpus. Note that adopting aligned corpus of insufficient size cause the same situation. We therefore propose a method to extract lexical translations using two corpora which are"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["aligned in the source and target language. Our method is proposed as the extension of the framework to solve the problem of choosing the translation according to the context. Thus, one of tile merits of our research is that two problems, look-ing for the translation according to the global and local context, are handled within the same framework.","2 Assumption and Ambiguity Resolution The source language is denoted as"]},{"title":"LA","paragraphs":["and the target as"]},{"title":"LB.","paragraphs":["Japanese and English have been adopted as"]},{"title":"LA","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"LB,","paragraphs":["respectively.

He showed that two matrices A and B resemble each ottmr, when ai correspond to bi for all i. Thus, the resem'ch had the additional assumption that, English words and German words correspond one~to-one.","We introdnce the translation matrix T from A to B because a word corresponds to several words rather than one. The (i,j)-th element of T is defined a~s the conditional probability p(bj[ai), the translational probability of bj given hi. T forms a stochastic matrix, such that the sum of all elements in the same row is 1.0.","The co-occurrences A~ in LA can be translated into LB using both p(bklau) mid p(btlav): ~-~p(bkla=)A=~p(btla,) (11 Denoting for all Bkl, (1) can be rewritten in a simple matrix formulation as follows:","TtAT (2) Note that tim resulting matrix is also symmetric.","Returning to the example of doctor given in this section, its translation is ~ but not |~:t:, because ~, the translation of the co-occurring word nurse, co-occurs with ~ but not with 15::1:. Thus, our assumption serves to resolve ambiguity.","This fact indicates that the translated co~ occurring matrix T t AT should resemble/3 (Figure 1). Defining IX- Y] as a certain distance between matrices X and Y, ambiguity resolution is possi~ ble by simply obtaining T which minimizes the following formula:","F(T) = ITtAT - BI (3) when A and B are known. Note that the above formulation assumes that the co-occurrence in LA can be transformed congruently into L~. Thus, T gives the pattern matching of two structures formed by co-occurrence relations (Section 4.2).","2.2 The Choice of Co-occurrence ~qeasure and Matrix Distance There :~:c many alternatives to measure co-occurrence between two words x and y (Church, 1990; Dunning, 1993). Having fi'eq(x) as the count of x in the entire text, freq(x, y) as the number of appearances of both x and y within a window of a fixed number of words, and N as the number of words in the text concerned, we adopt the following mutual information: Nfreq(ai, a j) (4) freq( ai ) fi'eq( aj ) Rapp argues that, freq(ai, aj)2/freq(ai)freq(aj) is although more sensitive than above. Formula (4), however, will be adopted due to its statistical property being already studied (Church, 1990).","Rapp normalized matrices A and B. We, however, do not normalize from the reason that the value by Formula (4) is already normalized by N 1 .","Distance for matrices should also be considered. Rapp used the sum of absolute distance of the elements. Since our requirement is that the distance is easy to handle analytically to obtain T as in Section 4.1, the following definition was ctmsen:","Ix - rl = - (5) i,j 3 Local Ambiguity Resolution Note that, the elements with value 0.0 in a matrix are denoted by \"-\" in the following discussion. 3.1 Example of doctor Suppose that doctor occurs in the local context \"The doctor nursed the patient.\" We wmlt to disambiguate the meaning of doctor as the medical doctor, not Ph.D. As doctor co-occurs with nurse and patient, nurse with doctor and patient etc., tim matrix A can be defined by Formula (4) as follows2:","doctor nurse patient doctor - 3.0 3.0 nurse 3.0 - 3.0 patient 3.0 3.0 -","For T, only the ambiguity of doctor is concerned here for simplicity, not that of nurse or patient, giving T as follows: doctor ~I~ 1 - - T41 - nurse - 1.0 - - patient - 1.0 -- Note that ~ is a co-occurring word with |~t. Here we are interested in whether Tll = 1.0 (doctor- [~) or ~/~1 = 1.0 (doctor--- |~d:): the correct answer is clearly T11 = 1.0.","1When we renormalized A and B and applied the incremental calculation which will be indicated in Section 4, T empirically oscillated and did not converge, because NA and NB can differ drastically.","2The value 3.0 refers to NA, which is calculated as (NA X 1)/(1 x 1) -= NA. whereas 1 is the frequency of each occurrence. Here NA is 3, the three words doctor, nurse and patient.","Tile quality of A is poor from a statistical point of view (Church, 1990). What is needed in the local ambiguity resolution is only the information of co-occurring words, and the co-occurrence values are not that important when forming A.
