The well-known problem with the technology is that this knowledge base is often difficult to build. In most research generm, ion systems, this knowledge base is essentially built by hand. No general solution to this problem has been proposed because each application has its own domain specific requirements.","It is clear, however, that for text generation technology to heeome viable, there must be some","* This work is partially supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"]},{"title":"(EP-SitC)","paragraphs":["Grant J19221, by I~C/DAAD aaC Project"]},{"title":"293,","paragraphs":["by the Commission of the European Union Grant LRE-62009, and by the Office of Naval Research Grant"]},{"title":"N00014-96-1-0465. t","paragraphs":["Starting this Fall, Dr. Paris' address will be CSIRO, Division of Information Technology, Sydney Laboratory, Building E6B, Macquarie University Campus, North Ryde, Sydney, NSW 2113, Australia","* Starting this Fall, Dr. Vander Linden's address will be Dept. of Mathematics and Compnter Science, Calvin College, Grand Rapids, MI 49546, USA. way to obtain at least portions of the knowledge base automatically. There could be a progn~m which automatically derives the knowledge base or perhaps the knowledge base could be built as part of manual processes that would have to be performed anyway. Either way, the marginM cost of adding text generation would be greatly reduced.","In this paper, we show that software documentation is an attractive application for multilingual text generation because it is an area in which pre-built knowledge bases are beconfing available. This is due in large part to the advancements in the user interface design comnmnity which we will review first. We then discuss the nature of the knowledge base required for the generation of documentation and how parts of it might be derived automatically.

We found that technical authors stm't the documentation process by le;~rn-ing how 1;o use the interface in question, construct-ing a user-oriented mental model of the product. They Kequently have no input or, her than the software itself. The authors indicated that they wouhl weleollle tools to hell) them collect the apl)ropriate information and create a formal representation of the resulting model. Such a representation wouhl supt)ort iterative construction of the doe,lmetltation and intbrmat:ion reuse.","Building our draft;lag tool, therefore, required us first, to determine how to represent the model of a task, and then to build tools for creating and manipulating this model. Given that the gemeral structure of instructional texts is hierarchical, we chose a representation that e.xpresses a hierart:hy of goals and sub-goals. The reI)resentation is thus similar to the (;raditi(mal structures found in AI plalming, e.g., (Sacerdoti, 1977), and also to task models used in interface design, e.g., (Card et al., 1983). Because user documentation frequently inchldes information other than the raw actions to be performed, our representation allows authors to include information not typically foulld in traditional plan rel)resentations such as: /1seroriented motiw~tional goals, helpflfl si(le-efl'e(;ts, and general COlllliletltS.","As an example, consider the rei)resentatitm of a sub-set of the procedure for retying a new file in a Microsoft; WoM-like editor shown in Figm:e 1. The owl,1 boxes in the figure ret)resent actions anti the rectangh',s represent plans. Ea('h of the action nodes in this sl;rueture rel)resent inter(:omw,(:i;e(t complexes of procedural and descriptive instances. For examl)le , the main us(;r goat of saving a do(;u.- meat, represented in the figure by the action node \"Save ;L Document\", is implemented in the knowledge base as a comple, x of instances repres(mting the act;ion being tmrformed (in this case saving), tim agent who performs action (the reader), the t)atient on whom the aetioll is performed (the current doeunmnt), etc. All of this itlforination is required to generate expressions of the action, but 1)resenting it would overly complicate the graph.","The links actually shown in tilt; figure are based on the, procedural relations in the domain model. For exalnple, the I)lan for saving a document (Save-l)ocument-Plan) is linked to its goal (Save A Do(:umelfl;), to its precondition (()t)e,n-Savc-As), and to its sul)-at:tions of typing a name for the (;llrrellt document (Tyl)e-Document-Name), open-"]},{"title":"ing","paragraphs":["l;he fohler in which it is to t)e saved (Ot)ei> l,'ohler), and clicking the Save tmtton (Choose-Save-Ilutton).

There was a clear need for facilities to ease the input task. In line with this, we noticed that certain elements of the model were also present in the specifications de-veloped in user interface design environments. In-deed, we found that a number of the actions and objects in the model could be automatically acquired from a design tool, thus providing basic building blocks from which the flfll model could be constructed.","3b illustrate this idea, we have built our example document editor application in VisualWorks, a widely available interface design environment (Vis, 1994). This tool allows one to define the windows, dialog boxes, and other widgets relevant for the application under develot)ment, and produces a prototype of the interface thus specified. Its output also includes declarative specifications of all the widgets. These specifications are thus available to be exploited by other systems. In partieular, we found that these specifications could be readily transformed into a form appropriate for the knowledge base required by a text; generation system such as DRAFTEI/.. In our examt)le then, we build a VisualWorks mock-up of our word processing application, and I)RAI,'TEK derives task model instmmes for all the windows and widgets in (;he application (e.g., the Save-As dialog box and all its widget, s) directly fl'om tile SmallTalk source code. DItAFTEI{ is also able to infer the basic interface actions that can be performed on the various interface widgets and creates task model instances for them as well. For example, the system automatically defines a clicking action instance for any \"button\" on the interface. Similarly, it c.reates opening and (:losing actions for all \"windows\".","Although this set of instances does not ret)resent all tile information that could, in principle, be derived from the SmallTalk specitications of the editor application, it nevertheless simplifies greatly the technical author's task of knowledge specification by providing the huilding blocks from which higher-level procedures can be defined. In tile case of out' admittedly simple example, seven of the nine actions in the procedural structure are automatically specified. The author is required to specify only the main user goal action and the three plan nodes. This is, t, hercfore, a step towards aut;omatically building the knowledge base required for the generation system. It is also a step towards integrating the (lesign and documentation processes, which is now widely recognised as being desirable. In our current work, we are investigating how more of the design knowledge call be made accessible ~md uiMel'standable to the technical authors, and what other tools would further facilitate tile authors' task. We are also looking at a tighter integration of the design and documentation processes, one in which tile individuals involved work together during design."]},{"title":"5 DRAFTER","paragraphs":["We. now describe I)I].AFTEI{> a technical authoring tool which supports the construction of tile task model discussed above and the drafting of multilingual instructions from that inodel.

This interface allows the author to work in terms of sentences rather than in terms of interconnected graphs. Tile figure, for example, shows the author in the process of specifying tile node Save A Document. The top line of text (reader save [information]) shows the current state of the CNL specification. Words in brackets must be further specified. This is done by clicking on the word and selecting the appropriate pattern from a list of possible expansions. In tile figure, the author has clicked on [information] and is presented with a list of the types of information from which [document] can be selected. This process is driven by a controlled natural language grammar which specifies possible expansions at each point of tile derivation. The bottom line of text presents a flllly expanded de-fault at each point in the derivation. In the figure, this CNL text is \"reader save current document\" which could be expressed in English in a mnnber of ways including \"Save the current document\" and \"To save tile document\".","Once the action nodes of the graph have been created, or perhaps while they are being created, the author has the ability to link them together using a set of predefined procedural relations: goal, precondition, sub-action, side-effect, warning, and cancellation. This is done with a graphical outlin-ing mechanism. This mechanism allows authors to drag actions from the ACTIONS pane and drop them on the various procedural relation slots in the workspace pane, or, alternatively, to create new actions to fill the slots. The result is a procedural hierarchy such as the one shown in Figure 1.","This interface allows the author to specify the procedure in several ways. They may start from the main goal and work down tile structure, or they may start by specifying all the low-level actions and object and work up the structure. 5.2.2 The Knowledge Grapher","The Knowledge Grapher prevents tile author from losing orientation by maintaining the current state of the procedural structure in graphical form. This form is like that shown in Figure 1. Because the nodes are mouse-sensitive, it allows the author to iifitiate construction and maintenance functions by clicking on the appropriate nodes in tile graph. Authors can also invoke tile drafting tool from the graph. 5.2.a The Draft Text Viewer","The author may draft multilingual instructions oil any portion of tile procedural structure at any point in the specification process. This task is performed by the Drafting Tool which is briefly described in tile next section. This tool produces a draft of the instructions in English and French. These are presented to the author by tile Draft Text Viewer. The presented text is mousesensitive, allowing the author to access the knowledge base entry for selected part of tile text. In this way, the author can modify the underlying knowledge base while working from the text. In some cases the writer will decide to modify the generated text rather than tile underlying knowledge. For this purpose, a text editor is currently provided. 5.3 The Drafting Tool When the author initiates the Drafl;ing Tool (see Figure 2), m~.AF'rl~t calls the Text Planner with the discourse goal: make the user colnpetent to perform tile action specified by the author. The Text Planner selects the content appropriate for the instructions and builds a deep representation of the text to be generated. This portion of the text plalming task is done by tile text planner de-veloped by Moore and Paris (1993). Tile Text Planner then specifies the detailed elements of the. sentence structure. This portion of the task is done by a descendent of IMAGENE (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995).","Once complete, the text plans are passed to the Tactical Generator which generates t, he actual text in English and French. This task is performed by tile English and French resources of tile Komet-Penman Multi-Lingual development environment (KPML) (Bateman, 1995), The drafts generated for the example procedure are shown in Figm'e 4.","In these texts, we see. that the main nser goal, that of saving a document, is given as a title to the series of steps. Then, the steps to be perfi)rmed to achieve this goal are given. More detail on the, drafting process can be found elsewhere. 6 Summary In this paper, we have shown that the knowledge base required to produce user-oriented docu-Inentation automatically can be partially obtained from user interface tools and then augmented appropriately by technical authors. We presented a multilingual drafting tool which exploits output fi'om an interface design tool and provides flexible support to technical authors for augmenting the interface model thus obtained in order to build the task model required to generate documentation. We argued that software docuinentation is thus an attractive and realistic application for natural language generation.
