The principles have been validated in three ways. They were established fi'om a Wizard of Oz simulation corpus used to develop the dialogue model for a spoken language dialogue system. Developed independently of Gricean theory, some of the principles were refined through comparison with Grice's maxims of cooperativity in conversation. Finally, the principles were tested in the user test of the implemented dialogue system. The paper shows that Grice's maxims constitute a sub-set of the principles.

The aim has been to develop a realistic, application-oriented prototype whose dialogue management allows users to perform their reservation task in spontaneous and natural spoken language. Being well-structured, the ticket reservation task generally lends itself to system-directed dialogue in which the user answers questions posed by the system. The only user initiative our system permits is that users may initiate clarification and repair meta-communication through uttering the keywords 'repeat' and 'change'. In designing such a system, it is crucial to reduce the number of situations in which users are inclined to take other forms of dialogue initiative, such as asking questions when they do not understand the system's dialogue behaviour or providing information which the system did not ask for (Schegloff et al, 1977). This is why the issue of dialogue cooperativity came to play a central role in our design of the dialogue structure. We needed to optimist system dialogue cooperativity in order to prevent situations such as those described above. To this end, we developed a set of general principles to be observed in the design of cooperative, spoken human-machine dialogue. The principles have been validated in three ways. Firstly, they were developed on the basis of a simulated human-nmchine dialogue corpus collected during dialogue model design. Secondly, we compared the principles with Grice's maxims of cooperative human-human dialogue. Thirdly, the principles were tested against the dialogue corpus fi'om the user test of the implemented system.","This paper analyses the relationship between our principles and Grice's maxims. We first describe how the principles were developed (Section 2). We then justify the comparison between principles and maxires (Section 3). Section 4 compares principles and maxims. Section 5 briefly describes how the principles were tested the on user test dialogue corpus, and Section 6 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Developing and Testing Principles of Cooperative Human-Machine Dialogue","paragraphs":["The dialogue model for otu\" flight reservation system was developed by the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experimental prototyping method in which a person simulates the system to be designed (Fraser and Gilbert 1991). Development was iterated until the dialogue model satisfied the design constraints on, i.a:, average user utterance length. The dialogues were recorded, transcribed, analysed and used as a basis for inaprovements oil the dialogue model. We perlormed seven WOZ iterations yielding a transcribed corpus of 125 task-oriented human-machine dialogues corresponding to approximately seven hours of spoken dialogue. The 94 dialogues that were recorded during the last two WOZ iterations were performed by external subjects whereas only system designers and colleagues had participated in the earlier iterations. A total of 24 different subjects were involved in the seven iterations. Dialogues were based on written descriptions of reservation tasks (scenarios).","A major concern during WOZ was to detect problems of user-system interaction. We eventually used the following two approaches to systematically discover such problems: ( ) prior to each WOZ iteration we matched the scenarios to be used against the current dialogue model. The model was represented as a graph structure with system phrases in the nodes and expected contents of user answers along the edges. If a deviation from the graph occurred during the matching process, this would indicate a potential dia-328 logue design problem which should be removed, il' possible. (ii) The recorded dialogues were plotted onto the graph representing the dialogue model. As in (i), graph deviations indicated potential dialogue design problems. Deviations were marked and their causes analysed whereupon the dialogue model was revised, if necessary.","At the end of the WOZ design phase, we began a lllOl'e theoretical, forward-looking exercise. All the problenis of inleractioii uncovered dr!ring WOZ wore analysed and represented as violations of principles of cooperative dialogue. Each problem was considered a case in which the system, in addressing the user, iiad violated a principle of cooperative dialogue. The principles of cooperative dialogue were made explicit, based on the problems analysis. The WOZ corpus analysis led to the identification of 14 principles el: cooperative hun3an-machine dialogue (Section 4) based on analysis o1' 120 examples o1: user-systeill interaction problems. [1: the principles were observed in the design of the system's dialogue behaviour, we assunled, this would serve to reduce the occurrence of user diah)gue behaviour that lhe sysiem had not been designed to handle."]},{"title":"3 Maxims and Principles of Cooperative Dialogue","paragraphs":["We had developed our principles of cooperative hunlan-nmchine dialogue indel)endently o1\" Gricean co-, operativity theory (Bernsen et al., 1996a). ])rior to the user test (Section 5), we colni)ared the principles with (h'ice's Cooperative Principle and maxims. In lhis process Ihe principles achieved their current lornl as shown in Table 1. Their original expression is presented in Section 4. Grice's Cooperative Principle (CP) is a general principle which says thai, to act cooperatively in conversation, oilc should make one's \"conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occtlrs, by tile accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which one is engaged\" (Grice 1975). Grice proposes lhat the CP can be explicated in terms of four groups of simple maxires which are not claimed to be jointly exhaustive. The maxims are marked with an asterisk in Table 1.","Grice focuses on dialogues in which the interlocutors want to achieve a shared goal (Grandy 1989, Sarangi and Slembrouck 1992). In such dialogues, lie claims, adherence to the maxims is rational because it enstu'es Ihal the interlocutors pursue the shared goal most efl'iciently. Task-oriented dialogue, such as that of our SLDS, is a paradigm case of shared-goal dialogue. Grico, however, did not develop the inaxinls with the purpose of preveuthlg coinmunication failure in shared-goal dialogue.

Moreover, in order to adhere to GPI I, it is necessary lkn\" the speaker to recognise relevant differences among inlerlocutors and interlocutor groups in Icrms o1' background knowledge. Based on this recognition, a speaker either ah'cady has built prior to the dialogue, or adaptively buikts during dialogue, a model o1' the interlocutor which serves to guide speaker coopcrativily. Increased user 331 adaptivity in this sense is an important goal in SLDS design (Bernsen et al. 1994).","GPI l cannot be reduced to GPI (informativeness) because, first, GP1 does not refer to the notions of background knowledge and differences in background knowledge among interlocutors. Second, a speaker may adhere perfectly to 'exchange purpose' (cf. GPI) while ignoring the interlocutor's background knowledge. For instance, in the user test a user wanted to order a one-way ticket at discount price. The system, however, knew that discount is only possible on return tickets. It therefore did not offer the discount option to this user nor did it correct the user's misunderstanding. At the end of the dialogue, the frustrated user asked whether or not discount had been granted. Third, as argued above, GPll is presupposed by maxims GPI, GP2 and GP5-GP9. Grice, however, does not argue that GP1 is presupposed by those maxims whereas he does argue that GP3 (truth) and GP4 (evidence) are presupposed by them (Grice 1975). For similar reasons, GP5 (relevance) (Sperber and Wilson 1987), cannot replace GPI 1. Informativeness and relewmce, therefore, are not only functions of the purpose(s) of the exchange of infornmtion but also of the knowledge of the interlocutor.","11 (SP8).

In WOZ Iteration 7, for instance, a subject expressed surprise at not having been offered the option of being put on a waiting list in a case in which a flight was already fully booked.
