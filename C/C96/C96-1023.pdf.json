(3) nan-hiki 'how many animals' (Int.)","The resulting numeral-classifier noun phrase can modify another noun phrase, either linked by no 'of' 'XC-no-N', or 'floating' elsewhere in the sentence, typically directly after the noun phrase it modifies 'NXC'. It can also occur on its own, with anaphoric or deictic reference. Asahioka, Hirakawa, and Amano (1990) identify seven different patterns of use. In order to concentrate on the translation of classifiers and number, we will restrict our discussion to noun phrases of the type 'XC-no-N' and not discuss the problems of resolving anaphoric reference and floating quantifiers.","Semantically, each classifier relates to a class of nouns (Kuno, 1973, 25), often fairly arbitrarily. For example -hiki '(small) animal' is used to count small animals excluding rabbits, which are counted with -wa 'bird'. There is a default classifier -tsu 'piece' which can be used to count almost anything."]},{"title":"2.2 English 'Classifiers'","paragraphs":["In English, numerals can directly modify countable nouns 'X N'. In order to enumerate uncountable nouns, either the uncountable nouns have to be reclassified as countable nouns, or embedded in a partitive construction: two beers or two cans of beer 'X N' or 'X C of N' (Quirk et al., 1985, 249). This partitive construction is similar to the Japanese quantifying construction 'XC-no-N'.","Quirk et al. (1985, 249-51) divide partitive nouns into three main categories QUALITY PARTITIVES, QUANTITY PARTITIVES, and MEASURE PARTITIVES. QUANTITY PARTITIVES are further divided into three cases, the first where the embedded noun phrase is uncountable, the second where it is plural, and the third where it is singular and countable. All the partitive nouns themselves are fully countable.","QUANTITY PARTITIVES where the embedded noun phrase is headed by an uncountable noun, the first case, are then divided into GENERAL PARTITIVES such as piece which serve only to quantify and TYPICAL PARTITIVES such as grain which are more descriptive.","2There are some examples of words that can be either a common noun or josftshi: for example gy5 'line' or hako 'box', which can follow a numeral or stand alone. These nouns can be handled in two ways: (a) as a lexical class that combines the properties of common nouns and josftshi, or (b) as two separate lexical entities. ALT-J/E follows option (b), such nouns are entered into the lexicon twice, once as a common noun and once as a jos~ishi. 3 A Bilingual Analysis of classifiers As there is no direct fit between English and Japanese, it is necessary to categorize the Japanese and English classifiers and to define rules which will enable effective machine translation. We divide classifiers into four major types: IIN]T (Section 3.1), METRIC (Section 3.2), GROUP (Section 3.3) and SPECIES (Section 3.4). The main criteria for the analysis are the restrictions placed, in English, on the countability and number of the embedded noun phrase in a partitive construction. Whether a noun is a classifier, and if so which type, is marked in the lexicon for each Japanese/English noun pair.","We distinguish between five major different noun countability preferences, based on the analysis of Allan (1980), adapted for use in machine translation by Bond, Ogura, and lkehara (1994). 'Fully countable' nouns, such as knife, have both singular and plural forms, and cannot be used with determiners such as much. 'Uncountable' nouns, such as furniture, have no plural form, and can be used with much. Between these two extremes are nouns such as cake, which can be used in both countable and uncountable noun phrases. They have both singular and plural forms, and can also be used with much. We divide such nouns into two groups: 'strongly countable', those that are more often used to refer to discrete entities, such as cake, and 'weakly countable', those that are more often used to refer to unbounded referents, such as beer. The fifth major type of countability preference is 'pluralia tanta': nouns that only have a plural form, such as scissors. 3.1 Unit classifiers","UNIT classifiers are the prototypical classifiers. A UNIT classifier will be realized in Japanese a~ a jos{shi. However, there are three possible translations of a Japanese noun phrase of the form ~XC-no-N', where C is a unit classifier:","Individuate: Translate as 'X N', where the classifier C is not translated and the numeral directly modifies the countable English noun phrase: 1-hiki-no-inu 'l-piece of dog' --+ 1 dog.","Part: Translate as 'X C of N', where the classifier is translated by its translation equivalent (from the transfer dictionary) and N is uncountable (headed by a bare singular noun): 1-tsubu-no-kome 'l-grain of rice' -+ 1 'grain of rice.","Default: Translate as 'X C of N' where the classifier is replaced by a default that depends on the embedded noun and N is uncountable. The default is normally piece, but this can be over-ridden by an explicit entry for N's default classifier in the lexicon: 126","Table 1: Unit Classifiers Noun Type General Typical Special Fully Countable Strongly Countable Weakly Countable Uncountable Pluralia Tanta (pair) 1 (log 1 cake 1 hair 1 piece of information 1 pair of scissors 1 dog 1 crumb of cake 1 strand of hair 1 grain of information 1 pair of scissors 1 slice of dog 1 slice of cake 1 slice of hair 1 slice of information"]},{"title":"1-tsu-no-kagu","paragraphs":["'l-piece of furniture'"]},{"title":"-~ 1 piece of furniture.","paragraphs":["The three types of UNIT classifier are summarized in Table 1. a Having established three possible translations of the"]},{"title":"'XC-no-N'","paragraphs":["construction, we can proceed to divide UNH' classifiers into three types, depending on which of the above alternatives is most suit-able.
