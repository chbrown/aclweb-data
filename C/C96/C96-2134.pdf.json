Text documents are generally cb~ssified by significant words (keywords) of the documents. However, it is difficult to extract these significant words from Japanese text, because Japanese texts are written without using blank spaces, such as delimiters, and must be segmented into words. There-fore, instead of words, we used domain specific kanji characters which appear more frequently in one domain than the other. We extracted these domain specific kanji characters by X ,2 method. Then, using these domain specific kanji characters, we clas-sifted editorial columns \"TENSEI JINGO\", editorim articles, and articles in \"Scientific American (in Japanese)\". The correct recognition scores for' them were 47%, 74%, and 85%, respectively."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Document cl~sification has been widely investigated for assigning domains to documents for text retrieval, or aiding human editors in assigning such domains. Various successful systems have been developed to classify text documents (Blosseville, 1992; Guthrie, 1994; Ilamill, 1980; Masand, 1992; Young, 1985).","Conventional way to develop document classification systems can be divided into the following two groups: 1. semantic approach 2. statistical approach In the semantic approach, document classification is based on words and keywords of a thesaurus. If the thesaurus is constructed well, high score is achieved. But this approach has disadvantages in terms of development and maintenance. On the other hand, in the statistical approach, a human exl)ert classifies a sample set of documents into predefined domains,"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["the computer learns from these samples how to classify documents into these domains.

In either approach, document classification using words has problems as follows:","1. Words in the documents must be normalized for matching those in the dictionary and the thesaurus. Moreover, in the case of Japanese texts, it is difficult to extract words from them, because they are written without using blank spaces as delimiters and must be segmented into words.","2. A simple word extraction technique generates to() many words. In the statistical approach, the dimensions of tim training space are too big au(l tim classification process usually fails. Therefore, the. Jal)anese document classification on words needs a high l)recision Japanese morphological analyzer and a great amount of lexical knowledge. Considering these disadvantages, we propose a new method of document classification on kanfi character,s, on which document classification is performed without a morphological analyzer and lexieel knowledge. In our approach, we extracted domain specific kanji characters for' document classification by the X 2 metho(I. The features of doculnents and domains are rel-)resented using the tim_ ture space the axes of which are these domain specific kanji characters. Then, we classified Japanese documents into domains by mea~suring the similar-ity between new documents and the domains in the feature space."]},{"title":"2 Document Classification on Domain Specific Kanji Characters","paragraphs":["2.1 Text Representation t)y Kanji Characters In previous researches, texts were represented by significarlt woMs, and a word was regarded as a minimmn semantic unit. But a word is not a minimum semantic unit, because a word consists of one or more morphemes. Here, we propose the text representation by morpheme. We have applied this idea to the Japanese text representation, where a kanji character is a morpheme. Each kanji character has its meaning, and Japanese words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on) usually contain one or more kanji characters which represent the meaning of the words to some extent.","When representing the features of a text by kanji characters, it is important to consider which kanji characters are significant for the text representation and useful for classification.

So, it is difficult to extract appropriate domain specific kanji characters from the articles which are classified into the authors' specialties.","Therefore, it is important to consider that 206 specialties in the encyclopedia, which represent almost a half of the specialties, are used as the subjects of the domain in the Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC). For example, botany, which is one of the authors' specialties, is also one of the subjects of the domain in the NDC. In addition to this, the NDC has hierarchical domains. For keepiug the domains well balanced, we combined the specialties using the hierarchical relationship of the NDC. The procedure for combining the specialties is as follows:","1. We aligned the specialties to the domains in the NDC. 206 specialties corresponded to the domains of the NDC automatically, and the rest was aligned manually.","2. We combined 418 specialties to 59 code domains of the NDC, using its hierarchical relationship. 'Fable 1 shows an example of the hierarchical relationship of the NDC. However, 59 domains are not well balanced. For example, \"physics\", \"electric engineering\", and \"German literature\" are the code domains of the NDC, and we know these domains are not well balanced by intuition. So, for keeping the domains well balanced, we combined 59 domains to 42 manually.","3.2 Selection of Domain Specific Kanji Characters by the X 2 Method Using the value X 2 of the X 2 test, we can detect the unevenly distributed kanji characters and extract these kanji characters as domain specific kanji characters. Indeed, it was verified that X ~ method is useful for extracting keywords instead of kanji characters(Nagao, 1976).","Suppose we denote the frequency of kanji i in the domain j, mid, and we assume that kanji i is distributed evenly.

If the value X/2 is relatively big, we consider that the kanji i is distributed unevenly.","There are two considerations about the extraction of the domain specific kanji characters using the X 2 method. The first is the size of the training samples. If the size of each training sample is different, the ranking of domain specific kanji characters is not equal to tile ranking of tile value X 2. 'File second is that we cannot recognize which domains are represented by the extracted kanji characters using only the value X :~ of equation (3). In other words, there is no guarantee that we can extract the appropriate domain specific kanji characters from every domain. From this, we have extracted the fixed number of domain specific kanji characters from every domain using the ranking of the value X~ d of equation (4) instead of (3). Not only the value X~ of equation (3) but the value X~ d of equation (4) be-come big when the kanji i appears more frequently in the domain j than in the other. Table 2 shows top 20 domain specific kanji characters of the 42 domains. Further, Appendix shows tim meanings of each domain specific kanji character of \"library science\" domain. 3.3 Feature Space for the Docmnent","Classification In order to measure the closeness between an unclassified document and the 42 domains, we proposed a feature space the axes of which are domain specific kanji characters extracted from the 42 domains. To represent the features of an unclassified document and the 42 domains, we used feature vectot's (1) and (2) respectively. To find out the closest domain, we measured an angle between the unclas-sifted document and the 42 domains in the feature space. If we are given a new document the feature vector of which is x, the classification system can compute the angle 0 with each vector vi which represents the domain i and find vi with rain 0 ( vi , z ) . i Using this procedure, every document is classified into the closest domain. 796","TaMe 1: Division of the Nippon Decimal Chtssification","- technology/engineering (:lass .... 54(0) electrical engineering code 548 information engineering item 548.2 computers detailed item \\ small items 548.23 memory Ilnit more detailed item"]},{"title":"J","paragraphs":["NDC is tile most popular library cl,-~ssification in Jal)an and it has tile hierarchical domains.

We aligned these domains to the 42 domains described in Section 3.1. Some articles in thereof contain two or more themes, and these articles are classified into two or more domains by editors. For example, the editorial article 'qbo Many Katakana Words\" is classified into three domains. In these cases, we.j,dge that the result of the automatic classification is correct when it corresponds to one of the domains where the document is cbLs-sifted by editors. Figure 3 , Figure 4, and Figure 5 describe the variations of the classification results with respect to the number of domain specific kanji characters. 4.2 Evaluation In our approach, the maximum correct recognition scores for the editorial articles and the articles in \"Scientific American (in Japanese)\" are 74 % and 85 %, respectively. Considering that our system uses only the statistical information of kanji characters and deals with a great amount of documents which cover various specialties, our approach achieved a good result in document classification. From this, we believe that our approach is efficient for broadly classifying various subjects of the documents, e.g. news stories. A method for classifying news stories is significant for distributing and retrieving articles in electronic newspaper.","The maximum recognition scores for \"TENSEI JINGO\" is 47 %. The reasons why the result is far worse than the results of the other are:","1. The style of the documents The style of \"TENSEI ,lINGO\" is similar to that of an essay or a novel and it is written in colloquial Japanese. In contrast, the style of the editorial articles and \"Scientific American (in Japanese)\" is similar to that of a thesis. We think the reason why we achieved the good result in the classification of the editorial articles and \"Scientific American (in Japanese)\" is that many technical terms are used in there and it is likely that the kanji characters which represent the technical terms are domain specific kanji characters in that domain.","2. Two or more themes in one document Many articles of \"TENSEI JINGO\" contain two or more themes. In these articles, it is usual that the introductory part has little relation to the main theme. For example, the article \"Splendid ILetirement\", whose main theme is the Speaker's resignation of the llouse of Representatives, ha~s an introductory part about the retirement of famous sportsmen. In conclusion, our aplJroach is not effective in classifying these articles. However, if we divide these articles into semantic objects, e.g. chapter and section, these semantic objects may be classified in our approach.
