There are four basic levels of representation: ()RTII, CAT, SEM and RQS. CAT encodes syntax using a eategorial grammar approach, so there are simple (e.g. noun: N) and complex (e.g. adjective: N/N) categories. It is to be noticed that in complex categories the active element is not a category but a lexical sign, in a way that selective restrictions may be set at this level by specifying the semantic type or other features of the selected sign. SEM encodes logic,'d semantics, RQS is basically equivalent to Pustejovsky's Qualia SlruCltlre (henceforth QUAI,IA).","The Theory of Qualia is embedded in that of the Generative Lexicon and has as a basic aim lo improve compositionalily by endowing lexical signs with a rich internal structure which accounls for different facets of human knowledge about lexical-semantic content, in a way that, iu many cases, it allows for avoiding listing separate entries to account for lexic~d polysemy. [PUS95] posits the lexical entry to be constituted by four stn~ctures: Fveut, Argument, Lcxical-lnheritauce and QUALIA. The latter consists of lout Quales: Agentivc (origin or 'bringing ~d×mt' of objects), Telic (purpose and function), Formal (Ihat which distinguishes it withiu a larger domain: magnitude, shape, dimcusionality) and Constitutive (relation between au object and its constituents or [ ]'his work has been dcvelopped for Spanish.

In any case, if a 'lemon' weren't an individuated and bounded thing, it couldn't be sliced and tile shape of tile portion wouldn't depend on that of the whole. The confusing point is that I,IMON in tile example, RODAJA DI: LIMON, surfaces grammatically as substances usually do -namely, zerodelermined. Bul zero-detcrlninalion is not exclusively a ressource to refer to substances, it is the way of expressing cumulative rclcrence. Both individuals and substances may be refered to cumulatively, that is, bc construed as an indiffercntiated ~unassment.
