Given a particular hnmediate Dominance grammar and hierarchies of feature values potentially rel evant for linearization (=the systelu's bias), the leanler generates appropriate naturM language expressions to be ewduated as positive or negative by a teacher, and produces as output IAnear Precedence rules which can be directly used 1)y the gralnmar. 1 Introduction The lnanual cotnpilation of a. sizable grammar is a difficult and time-consuming task. An important subtask is the construction of word ordering rules in the grammar. '['hough some languages are proclaimed as having simple ordering rules, e.g. either complete scrambling or strictly \"fixed\" order, most languages exhibit quite complex regularities (Steele, 198l), and even the rigid word order languages (like 1,;nglish) and those with to tal scrambling (like Warlpiri; cf. (H ale, 1983) may show intricate rules (Kashket, 11981); hence the need for their automatic acquisition. 'Fhis I;ask however, to the best of our knowledge, has not heen previously addressed.","This paper describes a prograln which, given a grammar with no ordering relations, l)roduces as outpu_t a set of linearization, or Linear Precedence, rules which can be directly employed by that grammar. The learning step uses the version space algorithm, a familiar techlfique from ma.chine learning for learning from examples. In contrast to most previous uses of the algorithnl for various learning tasks, which rely on priorly given classified examples, our learner generates itself tile training instances olte at a tinie, and they are then classed as positive or negative by a teacher. A selective generation of training instances is employe, d which facilitates the learning by minimizing the nu,nl)er of evaluations that the teacher needs to make.","The next section (h.'scribes the hmnediate Dominance/Linear I)recedence grammar format. In section 3, tlle lask of learning l,inear Precedence rules is interpreted as a task of learning from examples, and section 4 introduces the version space ]nethod. Section 5 is a system overview, and section 6 focuses on implementation. Finally, some limitations of the system a.re discussed as well as some directions for future research.","2 hnmediate Dominance/Linear Precedence Grammars A standard way of expressing tile ordering of nodes in a grammar is I)y means of l,inear Precedence rules in hnme(liate l)ominance/IAnear I','ocede,,ce.

The m/U' for:- mat was first introduced by (Gazdar and Pullmn, 1981) and (Gazdar el.. al., 1985) and is usually associated with GPS(], but is also used by IIPSG (l'ollard and Sag, 1987) and, under different guises, by other formMisins a.s well.","In all ll)/I,P grammar, the two types of in-"]},{"title":"formation, constituency (or,","paragraphs":["immediate dominance) and linear order, are separated.

ID/LP grammars capture an important ordering generalization, missed by usual CFGs, by means of the so calle(/ \"l'3xhaustive Partial Ordering Constraint\", stating that the l)artial ordering of any two sister nodes is constant throughout the whole grammar. That is, just one of the Mlowing three situations is valid for the ordering of any two nodes A and 11: either A < B (A precedes B) or d > B (A follows B) or A <> 11 (A occurs in either position with respect to B).

Upon a common understanding (Lea and Simon, 1974), learning from examples is a cooperative search in two spaces, the instance space, i.e. the space of all possible training instances, and the rule (=h.ypotheses) space, i.e. the space of all possible general rules. Besides these two spaces, two additional processes are needed, intermediating them: interpretatioT~ and instance selection. The interpretation process is needed, in moving from the instance space to the rule space, to interpret the raw instances, which may be far removed in form froln the form of the rules, so that instances can guide the search in the rule space. Analogously, the instance selection rules serve to transform the high-level hypotheses (rules) to a representation useflfl for guiding the search in the instance space.","A general description of our task is as follows: Given a specific ID grammar with no LP rules, find those LP rules. 1 In this task we also need to reason from very specific instances of LP rules (language phrases like small childreu, *children smalt) to rnore general LP rules (adjective < noun), therefore it can be interpreted in terms of tile two-space model, described above.","Our instance space will consist of all strings generable by the given ID grammar (the size of this instance space for any non-toy grammar will be very large). The LP rules space will be an un-ordered set, whose elements are pairs ot' nodes, connected by one of the relations <, > or <>, e. a LP set = [[A < B], [B < l';], [E > C], ... ]. (The size of the LP rules space will deperid upon the size of the specific ID grammar whose LP rnles are to be learned.)","We also need to define the interpretation and instance-selection processes. In the learning system to be described, for both purposes serves (basically) a mete-interpreter for ll)/LP grammars, which can parse tile concrete grammar, given at the outset, for both analysis and generation. In an interpretation phase, the mete-interpreter will parse a natural language expression outputting an LP-rules-space approriate representation, whereas in the instance-selection phase the","1Though indeed this is the usual way of looking at the task, sometimes we may need to start with some LP rules already known; the program we shMl describe supports both regimes. meta-interpreter, given an LP space representation as input, will generate a language expression to be classified as positive (i.e. not violating word order rules) or negative (i.e. violating those rules) by a teacher."]},{"title":"4 The Version Space Method","paragraphs":["There are a variety of methods in the AI literature for learning from exarnples. For handling our task, we have chosen tile so called \"version space\" method (also known as the \"candidate elimination algorithm\"), cf. (Mitchell, 1982). So we need to have a look at this method.","Tile basic idea is, that ill all representation languages for the rule space, there is a partial ordering of expressions according to their generality. This fact allows a compact representation of the set of plausible rules (=hypotheses) in the rule space, since the set of points in a partially ordered set can be represented by its most general and its most specific elements. Tile set of most general rules is called the G-set, and tile set of most specific rules tile S-set.","Figure 1 illustrates the LP rules space of a determiner of some grammatical nulnber (singular or l)lura.l) and an adjective, expressed in predicate logic.","Viewed top-down, the hierarchy is in descending order of generality (arrows point from specific to general). The topmost LP rule is most general and covers all the other rules, since det(Num), where Nnm is a variable, covers both det(sg) and det(pl), and <> covers both < and >. Each of the rules at level 2 are neither more general nor more specific than each other, but are more general than the most specific rules at the bottorn.","The learT~ing method assumes a set of positive and negative examples, and its aim is to induce a rule which covers all the positive examples and none of the counterexamples. Tile basic algorithm is as follows:","(1) The G-set is instantiated to the most general rule, and the S-set to the first positive example (i.e. a positive is needed to start the learning process).","(2) The next training instance is accepted. If it is positive, frorn the G-set are removed the rules which do not cover the example, and the elements of S-set are generalized as little as possible, so that they cover the new instance. If the next instance is negative, then fl'om the S-set are removed the rules that cover the counterexample, and the elements of the G-set are specialized as little as possible so that the counterexample is no longer covered by any of the elements of the G-set.","(3) The learning process terminates when the G-set and the S-set are both singleton sets which are identical. If they are diflhrent singleton sets, the training instances were inconsistent. Otherwise a new training instance is accepted. 884 deL(Nun,) <> a~ti det(sg) <> adj det(Num) < adj det(Nuni) > adj de.t(pl) <> adj det(sg) < adj det(pl) < adj do.t(sg) > adj det(pl) > adj Figure 1: A Generalization hierarchy","Now, let us see how this works with the l,P rules version space in Figure 1, asslllning further the following classitied exaanplcs ((+) nteans l)ositiw~, and (-) negative instance):"]},{"title":"(+) det(sg) < a,ti","paragraphs":["(--) det(sg) > adj (+) dct(pl) < adj","The algorithni will instanLiate the {i-set to the n:iost general rule iii tile version space, and tim ,5'-set to the first positive, obl, aining: G-set: [[dot(Nu,n) <> ad.i}]"]},{"title":"s-set: [[det(sg) < add]]","paragraphs":["'/'hen the next exmnple will lie accepted, which is negative.

It has been proposed in the (computational) linguistics literature (e.g. (Zwicky, 1986), Ojeda, 11988, Pericliev and Grigorov, 1994) that LP rules of the standard format may be insufficient in some ca.s-es, and need to be augmented with other ordering relations like \"immediate precedence\" <<, \"fist\", \"last\", etc., and more generally, that linearization needs to be stated in complex logic expressions connected by conjunction, disjunction and negation.
