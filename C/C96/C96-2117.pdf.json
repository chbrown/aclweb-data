Every Korean sentence indicates whether honorification occurs in it. The occurrence of honorification in a sentence is constrained by relative social status of the individuals involved in the sentence. By using the intbrmation about social status and the information about sentence-external individuals such as speaker and addressee, we can explain why a sentence is felicitous in a restricted context and whether a dialogue is coherent or not. Since it is possible and easy to include such contextual intormation in the IfPSG formalism, that formalism is adopted here. The implementation of Korean dialogue processing and the computation of social status is made based on ALE system."]},{"title":"1 Preliminaries","paragraphs":["In the conventional approach to honorification in Korcan, attention has becn paid to subject honorification and a scntencc itself though the Korean honorification system consists of three types of honorification (that is, subject honorification, object honorifieation, and addrcssec honorification) and the scntenceexternal individuals (i.c., speaker and addressce) play an important role in the honorification system.","In our approach speaker and addrcssce are specified for cach scutcncc and all thrce types of honorification arc c(msidcred simnltancously. In addition the approach uses the inlormation about the sentence-external individuals as well as the individuals mentioned in a sentence to compute relative social status. In Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) the information about speaker and addressee can be included in a lexical sign and thus thai: grammar formalism is adopted in our approach.","This paper shows how to compute relative social status o1' the persons involved in a dialogue which is a series of sentences. The attempt to compute social status of the individttals involved in a dialogue has never been made betbre. A dialogue processing and the computatiou of relative social status are impleinentcd using the system of ALE (Carpenter and Penn, 1995).","Knowledge of honorific morphemes in Korean is requisite to the inference of social status and thus it is explained in Section 2. The problem with the previous approach and the reason why a sign-based approach is suitable to the computation of social status are presented in Section 3. Section 4 deals with the inference of social status in a coherent dialogue and the detection of an incoherent dialogue. Section 5 presents the implementation of dialogue parsing and the computation of relative social status within the ALE system. Finally in Section 6 the importance of the contextual information and the advantages of our approach ale discussed."]},{"title":"2 Morphemes Relevant to Honorification","paragraphs":["Depending on who is respected by speaker, the honorification type is determined (for example, when a subject referent, an ohject referent, and addressee are honored by speaker, subject honorification, object honorification, and addressee honorification occur, respectively). The linguistic realization of these types of honorifieation is manifested by specific morphemes such as an honorific suffix, honorific case markers, an honorific infix, honorific verbal endings, and hmnble verb forms. Let us look at them one by one.","First, when the honorific suffix him attaches to an NP, the referent of the NP is respected by speaker.","Second, if an honorific case marker is used, the referent of the NP to which the honorific case market\" attaches is respected by speaker. Plain (i.e., non-honorific) case market's and honorific case markers corresponding to them are as shown in (1). (1) Case Markers -~_ nominative genitive plain ka, i uy h0nol'ific kkeyse dative accusative . e.ykey . u.!, hfl kkcy Since neither an honorific genitive case marker nor an honorific accusative case marker exists, the referent of a genitive NP or an accusative NP is respected when the genitive NP or the accusative NP contains the honorific suffix nim. It is also possible to attach both the honorific suffix nim and an honorific case marker to an NP.","Third, the honorific infix si appearing in a verb indicates that the referent of a subject NP is respected by speaker. 693","Fourth, honorific verbal endings indicate that speaker shows"]},{"title":"honor","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"courtesy","paragraphs":["to addressee.

For example, when a conversation is made between friends, an informal verbal ending is used.

Their claim is that there is a syntactic agreement between a subject NP and its corresponding verb.

As far as subject honorification is concerned, their assertion is correct. Their approach, however, is in-complete and cannot be applied to the computation of social status for the following reasons.","First, every sentence has a verb. Addressee honorification is indicated in a verb. Subject honorification is manifested in a subject NP and a verb. Thus even if a sentence itself is looked at, it is necessary to consider both addressee honorification and subject honorification.","Second, the consideration of a sentence itself is not enough because honorification phenomenon is related to the sociolinguistic factor such as social status. In their approach, it cannot be explained why the sentence in (4) instead of the sentence in (5) must be used when speaker has higher social status than the subject referent though the two sentences are equally grammatical.","(4) Park kwacang-i naka-ss-c.","chief section-nora go out-past-dec 'Chief section Park went out.'","(5) Park kwacang-nim-i naka-si-ess-e.","chiefsection-hon-nom go out-hon-past-dec 'Chief section Park went out.'","Finally, it is not possible to compute social status at all just by the information that the subject referent who is mentioned in a sentence is respected. In the computation of social status it is necessary to know the binary relation such as the person A is respected by the person B. In the honorification system the person who respects others is always speaker. Thus in computing social status speaker should be available. Their approach, however, cannot gain access to speaker, who is a sentence-external individual because only a sentence itself is considered."]},{"title":"3.2 A Sign-Based Approach","paragraphs":["In HPSG which adopts a sign-based approach, the information about sentence-external individuals such as speaker and addressee as well as the information about the persons mentioned in a sentence can be included in a lexical sign.

The advantages of including contextual information in the implementation are that it is possible to catch the context where a sentence is felicitous and it is also possible to detect whether a dialogue is coherent. If a dialogue is coherent, the order of the social status of the individuals involved in the dialogue is produced, whereas when a dialogue is found incoherent, the reason for incoherence is produced. Our approach sets a new direction of processing Korean in that it considers and implements the important fact that a Korean sentence is constrained by relative social status of the individuals involved in the sentence."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I am grateful to Matt Crocker and Lex Holt for valuable discussion and comments.
