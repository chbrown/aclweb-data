The intension contains those objects whose representation is supposed valid for speakers and situations related to discourse enunciation aitd to the application dolnain : there exists a consensus between the speakers of the discom:se about these objects, which reflects \"general\" background knowledge (77~e dog is a stupid and spiteJ)U animal), The intensional objects are then kinds of \"logical\" concepts in their world.

Negation about the worht The type is negated in the present worhl but mq> posed valid elsewhere. For the linguists, the negation is not a simple problem For tit(: mathematical logiciau, a negation is a simple problem","Starting from a worhl where the negation is a, simple problem (which, [or example, is matheTnatieal logician), thc previous assertion entails tim opening of a new world, in which the new fact is asserted (7'he ncgation is uot a simple problem). When a discourse is expressed by mono-speaker, the assertion <)f a positive fact (the ncgation is not a simple fact) provoke a contradiction in the same world. This contradi<:tion can 1)e based at least on the dill'create betwec.n sub-objects of type: 'is ~, 'is not'. The solution seemingly substitutes a positive fact by a negative fa.ct one. 3.2.2 Negation about tim universe A fact preserLted as a type is negated as such and related to extensional objects (or the converse) : 7'hc doq is not a stupid animal, but Fctcr's is. 3.2.3 Negation about the cardinality it is sitnply a change of v;Jtte elf tile, eardinality value. 3.2.4 Negation about denominations Negation can focus on the \"denominations\" a.nd \"others-names\" sub-objects, l)enyi,g a \"denomination\" or \"other- natncs\", means to denying a property of the object.

We have the same situation in:","The cow does not eat with a knife","The cow does not cat grass with a knifc","Thc cow does not eat meat in Paris In these examples, only the choice of the last argument seems to bc concerned by the negation. 3.3 Negation of extensional objects A type underlies extensional objects : a change in the properties of a type entails the same change in the associated extensional objects. Of course, the reverse is not true : an extensionM object may have properties not possessed by the underlying type. From this it resalts that the only coherence for an extensional object is internal : it can not have contradictory sub-objects.","Note that ~n extensional object may be an individual or a (:lass ; of course, all the elements of the class must have the same properties. ]n fact, class and individual always coexist. Therefore, it is legal to infer a class of type T when the discourse introduces art individual of type '['. This is obvious in 'It is one of the neighbour's dogs' and also in 'lie does not have children, only one'. The last example shows that the negation of a property about a class may have two interpretation: the ordinary one, in which the property is negated for tit(', individual of the class attd the negation of the (:lass itself (or, conversely, of the individual) to pose the property about an individual (a (:lass).","lit the sentence : ' Only Peter came ', we pose a property Mmttt Peter; then 'only' introduces the class and, of the same time, indicates that the class contains only Peter. This entails that tit(', negation may focus on only (negation that the class contains only one individnM) or on the property (Pcter caste), then asserted about 'only Peter'.","Another interesting example is 'All students succeed' : we assert a property about the class student and, then, specify that the class is studious, that is : the property is valid for all individuals of the (:lass. in other words, that the class is the extensional projection of the type student: As in previous example, (,he negation can operate on all (the class is not studious) or on tire property asserted about ,~11 students."]},{"title":"4 CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented an object-based knowledge representation model that allows to extract and to represent knowledge in the knowledge base from discourse. This model can be used in the context of man-machine dialogue or for information retrieval. We have posed the problem of coherence as regard-ing the knowledge represented in the knowledge base, taking into account the apparent contradictions within discourse. The incoherence can be result fi:om a lot of phenomena but we restrict ourselves in this communication to incoherence stemming from negation. All the cases treated (among others) show that a surface negation does not always fit a deep negation and, in fact, seldom entails ~n incoherence.
