Japanese, however, imposes difficulties of subcategorizing in part because it allows arbitrary ellipses of case elements. We propose a new type of verb subcategorization frame code set that combines the verb's surface case set and the deep case set, as a solution to the difficulties of empirical researches on Japanese. The lexicon developed by this design has comprehensive information on the correspondences between the surface case frame and the deep case frame, and yet restrains the potential combinatorial explosion of the number of verb subcategorization frames by carefully identifying superficially different frames with an idea of alternative case markers and semantic roles, and by introducing the notion of surface case frame permutations. The number of different surface/ deep case mapping types is 250, after we completed the new subcategorization frame code development for 30,000 verbs and adjectives."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["An NLP system is supposed to be able to recognize the differences and commonalities between almost the same set of words in two different syntactic structures, such as \"Mary bit the dog\" vs \"Mary was bit by the dog.\" Considering this requirement, the contents in verb subcategorization frames play a major role of disambiguations in many NLP systems.","These frames should reflect linguistic facts of lexical information being concentrated on verbs. There have been, on the other hand, some researches that aim to equally treat lexical information of nouns and that of verbs (see e.g. EDR94). Pustejovsky91 stepped further into formulating useful, intrinsic information in nouns with the notion of eo-compositionality among others, so as to recover from an elliptical sentence such as 'he began the book' a default verb such as 'reading.' However, in order to develop a working NLP system, even these recent researches may presuppose the use of exhaustive coding of verb subcategorization frame knowledge to let the new lexical features be automatically extracted and fully functional in their systems.","Ellipses appear to be a much more serious problem with Japanese than with English because all the supposedly obligatory case elements are virtually free to be dropped or to be placed anywhere in the sentence except for the predicate position at the end. These phenomena seem to have imposed difficulties upon the design of the lexicon so that no list of Japanese verb classes and types comparable to Grishman94, Levin93 or Hornby75 for English was readily available when our project started 1. Thus, we decided to make one by ourselves by a bootstrapping method: to make the initial list of the classification and to make it to grow by developing a working lexicon for MT systems. Upon this empirical study and development of over 30,000 Japanese verbs and adjectives, we propose an architecture for verb subcategorization that represents the mapping information between surface case frame and deep case (thematic role) frame. The proposal is to serve as a solution to the empirical difficulties with Japanese verbs and case elements described above. The lexicon by this design has comprehensive information on both the surface frame and the deep frame, and the correspondences between them, which are embedded in a code Yet, the number of codes has been controlled under a manageable figure of several hundreds so that the coding system could evade the potential combinatorial explosion. This is to be done by identifying superficially different case patterns with an idea of alternative case markers and semantic roles, and by largely extending the notion and the formulation of voice conversion for Japanese auxiliary verbs and equivalents.","The developed lexicon is adopted in a real world scale intedingua-based MT system that translates between English and Japanese (Muraki87). Our aim I Martin75 & FM&T85 contain some lists, but is too partial for the purpose of developing an MT system."]},{"title":"640","paragraphs":["here is to show an empirical result of the development and analysis of the lexicon from the point of view of space complexity order (cf.

The architecture that combines the verb surface case frame and deep case frame is described in section 3, followed by extended mechanisms lot applying what we generalized from voice conversion phenomena triggered by auxiliary verbs. We, then, describe the lexicon structure for ambiguity representations in relation to word senses. Finally, we present some statistic figures from the results of the lexicon development and confirm that the proposed architecture and the code system can empirically constrain the potential combinatorial explosions of the verb subcategorization frame representation varieties."]},{"title":"2. Linguistic Requirements of Verb subcategorization Frames","paragraphs":["The most notable syntactic phenomenon of Japanese is so-called scrambling. Any verb-modifying NP in a simple sentence in Japanese can appear at any position or does not have to appear at all, regardless of its surface case and deep case. In other words, word ordering is almost free for the major syntactic elements in a Japanese simple sentence except tor the predicate itself, which is to be placed at the end of the sentence. Not the word ordering but case postpositions mark the case of these NPs in relation to the main verb.

These replacement or addition do not alter the basic event structure of the sentences (2-1 a.,b ..... f.), but sometimes just add ambiguities to the syntactic structure as is shown in e.g. 2-2. e.g. 2-2 a. ok \"X-ha Y-ha Z-ni age-ru\"","b. ok \"Y-ha X-ha Z-ni age-ru\"","Practical Japanese sentence analyzers would need some semantic inference and default inference to plausibly identify X and Y using the semantic restrictions on each case element and the standard word ordering. Most nominative cases in Japanese verbs including \"agc-ru\" ('to give') have strong preference for human/animate attribute so that a meaningful difference between semantic similarity of X to animate object and the similarity of Y to other kind of concrete object leads to allocate nominative case on X and accusative case on Y in either 2-2 a. or 2-2 b.

Why is it not necessary to have more slots though we know there are definitely more than seven case postpositions in Japanese? One of the reasons 4 is that other postpositions that can be mapped into a thematic role are supposed to fall into either of the seven slot and take the position as the alternative case markers. For example, \"deha\" in Fig.l could only be used with animate plural nouns such as \"kotira"]},{"title":"('our side'),\"","paragraphs":["but it certainly could mark the nominative case. 4 The other reason is that there are case postpositions that are not mapped into thematic role.

This is why this use of case postposition \"deha,\" with a different semantic restriction, is supposed to occupy the same slot NOM with the major case postposition \"-ga\". Another slot DAT in Fig.1 shows that \"-he\" could replace the major case postposition \"-ni\" and be assigned the thematic role GOAl. Again, the following ungrammatical example e.g. 3-2 that violates the Unique Case Principle shows that \"-ni\" and \"-he\" for the verb \"ageru\" have to share the same slot in the subcategorization frame. e.g. 3-2 * X-ga Y-wo Z-ni Z'-he age-ta.","X-NOM Y-ACCZ-DAT Z'-DAT give-PERFective","\"X gave Y to Z '. \" For a simple Japanese analyzer that tries to fill as many slots as possible for a verb, the Unique Case Principle is virtually embedded in the subcategorization frame of our architecture for the computational lexicon.

Lexicon Structure in Relation to Word Senses","paragraphs":["There are cases in which one word sense corresponds to multiple subcategorization frames, other cases in which one word sense corresponds to one subcategorization frame each, and the other cases in which multiple word senses correspond to less number of subcategorization frames. Since our approach here is rather empirical so any guidelines that help the lexicon to be uniform in quality, we take advantage of other literature that aimed at some exhaustive listing of interesting cases. The example sentences in e.g. 3-6 are cited from Fillmore68, and e.g. 3-7, from Levin93. e.g.3-6 a. John opened the door with the key. b. The key opened the door. c. The door opened. d. John ate the meal. e. John ate.","e.g.3-7 a. John pounded the metal [flat]. b. Metal pounded flat. c. * Metal pounded. 7 The decision point could be even delayed into the generation phase of MT. As is briefly mentioned in the previous sections, the entry in our lexicon is composed of three blocks: M (Morphology)-Block, S (Syntax)-Block and C (Concept)-Block. M-Block contains the very surface information and can in general be linked to multiple S-Blocks. A whole subcategorization frame is described and stored in a S-Block coupled with corresponding other syntactic features such as aspect features. A C-Block linked from an S-Block or more represents an independent word sense, and, ideally, is linked to by other S-blocks that are linked to by other M-Blocks, in effect, other words of the same or the different language. The basic principle of the lexicon requires one to one correspondences between a subcategorization frame and an S-Block. So, any sentence in e.g. 3-6 or e.g. 3-7 ~ corresponds to a different S-Block from the others (except for e.g. 3-7c that does not exist). Any two S-Blocks can share the same word sense (C-Block) as long as the deep case (thematic role) frame is consistent. That is, all the case roles that appear in e.g.3-6 a, b and c are assigned different deep cases from one another: {John = AGenT, door = PATient, key = INStrument}. So are all the case roles in e.g. 3-6 a and b, and all the case roles in e.g. 3.7. Thus, our system of the lexicon could guarantee that these subcategorization frame s of intuitively the same word sense share the same C-Block.","There are other cases in which the above criteria require to separate the intuitively single word sense as is shown in e.g. 3-8 e.g.3-8 a.
