Introduction","paragraphs":["A Chinese sentence is composed of a string of characters without any word boundaries, so that to segment Chinese sentences is indispensable in Chinese language processing (Chen, 1990; Chen, 1994). Many word segmentation techniques (Chen & Liu, 1992; Chiang et al., 1992; Sproat & Shih, 1990) have been developed. However, the resolution of unknown words, i.e., those words not in the dictionaries, form the bottleneck. Some papers (Fung & Wu, 1994; Wang et al., 1994) based on Smadja's paradigm (1993) learned an aided dictionary from a corpus to reduce the possibility of unknown words. Chang et al. (1992) proposed a method to extract Chinese personal names from an 11,000-word corpus, and reported 91.87% precision and 80.67% recall. Wang et al. (1992) recognized unregistered names on the basis of titles and a surname-driven rule. Linet al. (1993) presented a model to tackle a very restrictive form of unknown words. Sproat et al. (1994) considered Chinese personal names and transliterations of foreign words. Their performance was 61.83% precision and 80.99% recall on an 12,000-Chinese-character corpus.","This paper deals with three kinds of proper nouns - say, Chinese personal names, transliterated personal names and organization names. We not only tell if an unknown word is a proper noun, but also assign it a suitable semantic feature. In other words, '~?~4~ ~' (George Bush) will have a feature of male transliterated personal name when it is identified. Such a rigid treatment will be helpful for further applications such as anaphora resolution (Chen, 1992), sentence alignment (Chert & Chert, 1994; Chen& Wu, 1995), etc. Section 2 describes the training corpora and the testing corpus we used. Sections 3, 4 and 5 propose tile identification and classification methods of Chinese personal names, transliterated personal names and organization names, respectively. Section 6 presents two applications. Section 7 concludes the remarks."]},{"title":"2. Training Corpora and Testing Corpus","paragraphs":["The proposed methods in this paper integrate the rule-based and the statistics-based models, so that training corpora are needed. To test the performance of language models, a good testing corpus is also necessary. This section introduces all the corpora that are used in the following sections.","NTU balanced corpus, which follows the standard of LOB corpus (Johansson, 1986), is the first training corpus. It is segmented by a word segmentation system and is checked manually. In total, this corpus has 113,647 words and 191,173 characters.","The second training corpus is extracted from three newspaper corpora (China Times, Liberty Times News and United Daily News). It is just segmented by a word segmentation system without checking manually. Although segmentation errors may exist, this corpus is 23.2 times larger than NTU balanced corpus, so that we can get more reliable word association pairs.","The third training corpus is a transliterated personal name corpus. There are 2,692 transliterated personal names, including 1,414 male's names and 1,278 female's names. Those transliterated personal names are selected from a book \"English Names For Yon\" (Huang, 1992). The last training data is a Chinese personal name corpus. It has 219,738 Chinese personal names and 661,512 characters. 222 Finally, the testing corpus is introduced. We","randomly select six different sections from a","newspaper corpus (Liberty Times News). The","contents are different from the second training","corpus. The following shows the statistics of the","testing corpus: (a) the political section","There are many items of news about the","legislature. It includes 23,695 words and","36,059 characters. (b) the social section","There are many items of news about police","and offenders. It includes 61,846 words and","90,011 characters. (c) the entertainment section","There are many items of news about TV stars,","programs, and so on. It includes 38,234","words and 55,459 characters. (d) the international section","It contains many items of foreign news and","has 19,049 words and 29,331 characters. (e) the economic section","Many items of news about stock market,","money, and so on, are recorded. It includes","39,008 words and 54,124 characters. (f) the sports section","All items of news concern sports. It includes","36,971 words and 54,124 characters.","Every section has its own characteristics. In the","political section, there are many titles. In the social","section and the entertainment ~ection, there are","many Chinese personal names and organization","names. In the international section, transliterated","personal names are more than the other two. In the","economic section, stock companies often appear. In","the sports section, there are many Chinese personal","names and transliterated personal names. Because","the proper nouns are usually segmented into single","characters, they will interfere with one another","during identification and classification."]},{"title":"3. Chinese Personal Names 3.1 Structure of Personal Names","paragraphs":["Chinese personal names are composed of surnames and names. Most Chinese surnames are single character and some rare ones are two characters. The following shows three different types:","(a) Single character like '~', }~', '~' and '-9:-'.","(b) Two characters like '~[~' and' k'(('.","(c) Two surnames together like 'JI,~'. Most names are two characters and some rare ones are one character. Theoretically, every character can be considered as names rather than a fixed set. Thus the length of Chinese personal names ranges from 2 to 6 characters."]},{"title":"3.2 Strategies 3.2.1 Segmentation before Identification","paragraphs":["Input text has to be segmented roughly beforehand. This is because many characters have high probabilities to be a Chinese personal name without pre-segmentation. Consider the example '~!,)~l~,@~l+j (@~l~...'. The character '(i@' has a high score to be a surname. In this aspect, '~)~' is easy to be a name. If the input text is not segmented beforehand, it is easy to regard '(q~.~J~' as a Chinese personal name. On the statistical model, this type of errors is difficult to avoid. However, it is easy to capture by pre-segmentation."]},{"title":"3.2.2 Variation of","paragraphs":["a Character How to calculate the score of a candidate is an important issue in this identification system. The paper (Chang"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1992) proposes the following formula: (I) P(W,GN) = P(GN) * P(WIGN ) This formula has a drawback, i.e., it does not consider the probability of a character to be the other words rather than a surname. Take the two characters '{,~,~' and 'llil[' as an example. The character '{'~j.' can form '{~', '1\",1/~ ', 'l\"~/-iiTfi ', and many other words. On the contrary, the character' I@i' just forms a word '@[1~', which is a rare word. The difference shows that the former is easier to be used as the other words than the latter. The above formula assigns the same score to '@/:-~' and '@[(-~', when '{'0¢' and '111~' have the same frequency to be names. Intuitively, '{~lj.~'-'.' does not look like a name, but 'ItlJU~.' does. Thus 'tliI(' should have higher score than '{~l', and the variation of a character should be considered in the formula. In our model, the variation of characters is learned from NTU balanced corpus."]},{"title":"3.2.3 Baseline Model","paragraphs":["Equation (2) defines the original formula. The formula used to calculate P(Ci) is similar to Equation (1). When the variation of a character is considered, Equation (3) is formulated.

Equation (6) screens out the","impossible candidates. The above three models can","be extended to single-character names. When a","candidate cannot pass the threshold, its last","character is cut off and the remaining part is tried","again. The threshold is different from the original","one. Thresholds are trained from Chinese personal","name corpus. We calculate the score of every","Chinese personal name in the corpus using the","above formulas. The scores for each formula are","sorted and the one which is less than 99% of the","personal names is considered as a threshold for this","fornmla. That is, 99% of the training data can pass","the threshold. 3.2.4 Other Clues Text provides many useful clues from three different levels - say, character, sentence and paragraph levels. The baseline model forms the first level, i.e., character level. The following subsections present other clues. Of these, gender is also a clue from character level; title, mutual information and punctuation marks come from sentence level; tile paragraph information is recorded in cache. 3.2.4.1 Clue 1: Title The first is title. Wang et a/. (1992) propose a model based on titles When a title appears before (after) a candidate, it is probably a personal name. For example, '~.-~)NI~, ' and ' ~,~ ~)'~ :~, ~. ~](' However, there are many","~!~,~ [ J Thus counterexamples, e.g., ' ~'~ ' ; (~ ~\"-4 :~'~ ~ ' f'J \" s': Y'.,., we cannot make sure if the characters surrounding a title form a personal name. Even so, title is still a useful clue. it can help determine the boundary of a name. In the example '~.J~J!~'~;~;:i-qj...',' ~-IDJ!SJ'~I~, '' is identified incorrectly. When a title is included in this example, i.e., '~JDJ!~!I~',;I~'~;IJ... ', the error does not occur. In sumnmry, if a title appears, a special bonus is given to the candidate 3.2.4.2 Clue 2: Mutual hfformation Chinese personal names are not always composed of single characters. For example, the name part of the sentence"]},{"title":"'l~i~rl)Jv~Jlai~lc'/;~'r~';jtlfj'","paragraphs":["is a word. How to tell out that a word is a content word or a name is indispensable. Mutual information (Church & Hanks, 1990) provides a measure of word association. The words surrounding a word candidate are checked. When there exists a strong relationship, the word candidate has high probability to be a content word. In the example '1~ ~!J:~l'/ ' ,~<~Jl~?_~.,.', the two words \"C I!!:\" and '~.~ [tl' have high mutual reformation, so that 'lI~, i","1~' is not a personal name. Three newspaper corpora (total size is about 2.6 million words) are used to train the word association. 3.2.4.3 Clue 3: Punctuation Marks Personal names usually appear at the head or the tail of a sentence. A candidate is given an extra bonus when it is found from these two places. Candidates surrounding the caesura mark, a Chinese-specific punctuation mark, are treated in the similar way. If some words around this punctuation are personal names, the others are given bonus. 3.2.4.4 Clue 4: Gender There is a special custom in Chinese. A married woman may mark her husband's surname before her surname. That forms type 3 personal name mentioned in Section 3.1, Because a surname may be considered as a name, e.g., '7/' in the personal name ~'~'/~Jt~ and in",",~,~r/,-, v,. the candidates with two tile personal name c~ ~,,~,, possible surnames do not always belong to type 3 personal name. The gender information, i.e., type 3 is always a female, helps us disambiguate the type of personal names. Some Chinese characters have high score for male and some for female. The following lists some typical examples:","male: ~, ,~, ~,\", ~t~,-1t(, ~j~, J¢J(~, 9~i, JI(, (~l,)~;","female: ~i~, J~, I~, ~l l, ~:~, ~;, {}::, '{~L ~Y, )J:, -+-/ 224 We count the frequencies of the characters to be male and female, and compare these two scores. If the former is larger than the latter, then it is a masculine name. Otherwise, it is a fenfinine name. 3.2.4.5 Clue 5: Cache A personal name may appear lnore than once in a paragraph This phenomenon is useful durmg identification We use cache to store the identified candidates, and reset cache when next paragraph is considered There are four cases shown below when cache is used:","(a) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, and","C I C2 is correct.","(b) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, and","both are correct.","(c) CIC2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, and","C 1 C2C3 is correct.","(d) C1C2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, and","CIC2 is correct. Here Ci denotes a Chinese character. It is obvious that case (a) contradicts with case (b). Consider the string ' 5J~J!i}'i;~,'J,)-}:jl','lif~:'j: ~l;~'. A personal ,mum '~! ID]J?;;[~, '' is recognized. When another string '}<-I~lJl})~. ~lt/Jxq':¢lJI,.';'_~')'l'lili~,t~' is input, '~,~llllfA)~' and 'Tlldx>l \":' are identified Then we find the two strings '/}'i.J~]}~)~, ' and ' +'iJ~]J'.~;a:'lY/' are similar. Here case (a) is correct. However, case (b) also appears very often in newspapers. For example, 'l~lL,kT~ \" J~l~J'gfJ~iH~ hi I, ~3...L Two personal names, 'li[]/k:~'~/ and 'lT[~]Kgt?' are identified In the examples like '~.~t~[<gif~ \" ~...' and '... ~.~ o ', two candidates '~.~;{~t~, ' and' }'#~' will be identified. That belon~ to case (d). Consider the last examples '11',(,1 i*l 1~,1:<..' and '~,(, i~l l~g, rii:j.dz... '. Two candidates '~,({~ i' and '~',(,~\" i~l I' will be identified too. Now, case (c) is adopted.","in our treatment, a weight is assigned to each entry in the cache. The entry which has clear right boundary has a high weight. Title and punctuation are chics for boundary. For those similar pairs which have different weights, the entry having high weight is selected. If both have high weights, both are chosen. When both have low weights, the score of the second character of a name part is critical. It aetermiues if the character is kept or deleted. 3.3 Experiments and Discussions Table l stunmarlzes the identification results of Chinese personal names. Total Chinese personal names in each section are listed in Cohlnm 2. Cohmm 3 shows the precision and the recall of the baseline model. The overall performance is good except for section 4 (the international section) and section 5 (the economic section). The remaining colunms demonstrate the change of performance after the clues discussed m Section 3.2 are considered incrementally. If name part of a candidate is a word, word association is used to measure the relationship between the surrotmding words. The increase of the precision in Cohmm 4 verifies this idea. Theoretically, it shottld not decrease the recall. After checking the result, we find that some unreasonable word association comes from the training corpus. Recall that it is generated by a rough word segmentation system wlthoul manually-checking. The next clue is punctuation. The idea is that the candidates m the beginning or at the end of sentences have larger probabilities to be personal names than they are in other places. It helps some candidates with lower score to pass the threshold, but it cannot avoid the incorrect candidates to pass the threshold Thus, the performance is dangling. Then, title is considered The increase of the recall shows that title works well But it decreases the precision too. From the variation of the performance, we know that cache is powerful. Both the recall and the precismn increase. Finally, gender is joined It is used when two successive characters are candidates of surnames. In other words, it focuses on type 3 personal names. Almost all type 3 personal names are identified correctly. Because this type of personal names is rare in the testing newspaper corpus, the variation is not large. Table 1 shows that our model is good except for section 4 and section 5. There are many proper nouns in the international section, and ahnost all of them are not included m the dictionary. All unknown words disturb one another in segmentation. For example, ' q!ilI¢~J~0,' is a countiy name. It is divided into three single characters by our word segmentation system. From the viewpoint of personal nmne identification, it is easy to regard ' lI,\"r~J~ff as a Chinese personal name. Another source of errors is foreign names. Some of them are similar to Chinese personal names, e.g., '~'~!Ui}/i:' and ' <t&jE'.","Table 1.

There are many company names, and some of them are similar to Chinese personal names. The company name '~]~]i)t' is a typical example. In summary, there are three major errors. One is foreign name. They are identified as proper nouns correctly, but are assigned wrong features. About 20% of errors belong to this type. The second type of errors results from the rare surnames, which are not included in the surname table. Some rare surnames are not real surnames. They are just artists' stage names. Near 14% of errors come from this type. The other errors include place names, organization names, and so on."]},{"title":"4.

Such a syllabic order is rare in Chinese, but is not special for a transliterated string. In other words, the syllabic orders of transliterated strings and general Chinese strings are not similar. Besides, a transliterated name consists of a string of single characters after segmentation. That is, these characters cannot be put together.

Those examples like ' ~r~', '~'J,,' and ' ~' which meet the character condition do not look like transliterated names because their pronunciations are not like foreign names. If there is a large enough transliterated name corpus, the syllable orders can be learned. However, our transliterated corpus only contain 2692 personal names. Thus only the first and the last characters are considered. For each candidate, we check the syllable of the first (the last) character.

Third, the keyword may be omitted completely. For example, '~_~),~' (Acer). The following shows two rough classifications, and discusses their feattues.","(l) Complete organization names","(a) Structure: This type of organization names is usually composed of proper nouns and keywords.","(b) Length: Some organization names are very long, so it is hard to decide their length. Fortunately, only some keyword like 'l iil ~ J.~\", ' ~ ~', '3,~,~,:~', '~[[,~I~', mid so on, have this problem.","(c) Ambiguity: Some organization names with keywords are still mnbiguous. For exmnple, ' X l\" ~(~ ii,~:,' and '1[~, ~'~'. They usually denote reading matters, but not organizations. However, if they are used in some contexts, e.g., \"~ l\"~f::il;~,~ ~ ~f! J3t[\" and \" l[~, ~ ~[~ (l~( ~lf )~ \", they should be interpreted as organizations.","(2) Incomplete organization names","(a) Structure: These organization names often omit their keywords.","(b) Ambiguity: The abbreviated organization names may be ambiguous. For example, '~t!,~($', '~ ~',' ,~,.,~!~' and '/~'/\" .... L~ - are famous sport teams m Taiwm~ or in U.S.A., however, they are also general content words."]},{"title":"5.2 Strategies","paragraphs":["This section introduces some strategies used in the identification.

For each sentence, we scan it from left to right to find keywords. Because keyword is a general content word, we need other strategies to tell out its exact meaning. These strategies also have the capabilities to detect the left boundary if there is an organization name.","Prefix is a good marker for possible left boundary. For example, '[,,~I~Z' (National), '~(~qL' (Provincial), '~]~ qi? (Private), and so on. The name part of an organization may be forlned by single characters or words. These two cases are discussed as follows.","(a) single characters","After segmentation, there nmy be a sequence of single characters preceding a possible keyword The character may exist independently. That is, it is a single-character word. In this case, the content word is not a keyword, so that no organization name is found If these characters cannot exist independently, they form the name part of an organization. The left boundary of the organization is determined by the following rule:","We insert a single character to the name part","until a word is met.","(b) word(s)","Here, a word is composed of at least two characters. If the word preceding the possible keyword is a place name or a personal name, then the word forms the name part of an organization. Otherwise, we use word association model to determine the left boundary. The postulation is: the words to compose a name part usually have strong relationships. The mutual information mentioned in Section 3.2.4.2 is also used to measure the relationship of two words.","Part of speech is useful to determine the left boundary of an organization. The categories of verbs are very typical. The name part of an organization cannot extend beyond a transitive verb. If a transitive verb precedes a possible keyword, then no organization name is found. Numeral and classifier are also helpful. For exan~ple, '~ HJ' (company) in '~fJ...' (three companies ...) is not a keyword due to the critical parts of speech. Because a tagger is not involved before identification, the part of speech of a word is determined wholly by lexical probability."]},{"title":"5.3 Experiments and Discussions","paragraphs":["Table 3 shows the precision and the recall for every section.

Even keywords appear, e.g., ' [-riJ~r fJ' and '~r ~ fi: ~-~', there may not always exist organization names. Besides error candidates and organization names without keywords, error left boundary is also a problem. Consider the exalnples: '~[';~['-'~!~.:),t~' and 'f~-~'.

In general, pronoun often refers to the nearest proper noun (Chen, 1992). But it is not always true.
