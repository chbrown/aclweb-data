The multi-agent systeln is now one of the promising solutions to achieve a complicated system (Maes, 91; Nishida and Takada, 93; Nagao aud Takeuchi, 94).","The multi-agent system which silnulates cooperation between qmman-agents' is realized by an integration of simplified autonomous flmctions. And ms a result it achieves a complicated system in total. It also has a latent potential to make a very flexible system.","Thus, we believe that if we introduce the concept of the nmlti-agent system into a dialogue system, we are able to construct a more sophisticated system which is able to treat various linguistic phenomena and to understand or to solw., nmre cmnplicated problems.","Focusing on dialogue systelns, while most current dialogue systems can treat only one domain (a small world for a single service), some research(Goddeau et al., 94; Nalnba et 31., 94) which aims at increasing the domains, what is called a transportable system(Grosz, 83; Paris, 89) are lmW on-going. Ill such systems, information re.- trieval across multil)le domains is realized using the relational databases. However in our systeln, it is difficult to retrieve information across nmltipie donlains, I)ecause the information is retrieved from CD-ROMs in which a large amount of texts are contained, 1)y using full-text retrieval techniques.","And while there are robust and useful strategies in certain goals, there isn't an all-powerful sterat-egy which covers all goals. If a robust strategy in a certain goal is introduced into tile system, the user misunderstands that the system hKs an all-powerful strategy. Thus, in our system the user sometimes gets into trouble as follows:","• the user misunderstands that the information contained across several data sources call be obtained at once.","• the user is confused between a certain retrieval strategy which is robust in a certain goal and another siml)le but rather redmldant strategy.","Furthernmre, it is difficult to manage a discourse involving multiple goals in current diMogue systems. This is because most current systems aren't robust enough for anaphora and they are able to manage only a single and simple context. This sometimes causes the following problem:","• the user has to manage the nmltiple contexts involving multiple goals, because the system only ma.nages a single context. And ithis makes it hard for the user to use the system. As the result, the user also gets lost in the system.","In this paper, we focus on how to make the user aware of what the system Call or cannot do. Thus, we propose a nev¢ dialogue system with multiple agents, in which we introduce the concept of multi-agent system into our dialogue system. Ill our system, three types of dialogue agents are re~ alized: 1) for each domain, 2) for each strategy and 3) for each context. These agents take turns and play their roles according to the discourse situations. With these agents, our system will haw; the following characteristics:","• the domain agents mM~e the user aware of the 1)oundary between unintegrated domains.","• the strategy agents make the user aware of the difference, between the don lain oriented strategies. 400","• the context agents make it ea.sy for the user to deal with tit(; coml)licatcd discourse involving multiple goals.","In this pal)er, we first Cxl)lain our l)aseline spoken dialogue systeln TARSAN which deM with multiple domains.

The second problem is that the user nfisunderstands that the system h~ an Ml-powcrfifi strategy, if it has a robust strategy for a certain purpose. Suppose that several discourse strategies exist in a single dialogue agent: one is a very sophisticated but very goal specific strategy which allows the user to reach the goal immediately, and another is a very simple but redundant strategy which has the ability to achieve any kind of goal. In this case, the user may conflme the potential of these strategies and feel uncomfortable about the gap.","3. The last problem is that the user has to manage multiple contexts concerning to multiple goals, because the system isn't enough robust for anaphora and only manages a single context. And this makes it hard for the user to use the system. Table 1 is an example that the user compares the information between Hakone and Nikko 1. The example shows that the user ha.s managed the context himself, which seems very complicated.","We have ,also assmncd that these three problems arise because the system only has a single diMogue agent. A single dialogue agent usually deals with everything and this makes the user invisible what the system can or cannot do. Thus, we propose a new diMogue system with multiple agents which make the system's ability more visible to the user."]},{"title":"4 Dialogue system with multiple dialogue agents","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce a new dialogue system with multiple, dialogue agents.

Figure 3 shows a brief sketch of the domain agents. The domain agents perform the basic interaction between the user and the system to retrieve the information in the basic manner specific to each domain. In every domain agent, indispensable and basic conditions for information rctrievM are defined. Using these conditions, the domain agent communicates with the user and performs the information retrievM. And when the user's input 1-noves from one domain to another domain, the domain agent will also change. Thus with the domain agents, the user is made aware of the boundary between the domains.

Figure 4 shows a brief sketch of the strategy agents. The strategy agents handle the interaction between the user and the system to retrieve the information in the manner specific to each task. In every strategy agent, task specific conditions for tim information retriewd are defined.
