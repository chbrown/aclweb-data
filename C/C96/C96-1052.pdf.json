For example, dialogue participants must produce utterances under time constraints where pauses in mid-utterance must not exceed a certain length. Moreover, participants are inference-limited (Walker and Rainbow 1994). Due to time constraints and limits in ilfference, dialogue participants cannot help producing utterances incrementally. Incremental utterance production is characterized like this: speakers produce utterances while deliberating what to say~ and refine what they will say while articulating the first part of their utterances.","The incremental strategy of utterance production plays a crucial role in spoken dialogues in two respects. First, it helps speakers to satisfy time constraints on pauses. This is crucial since lengthy pauses imply the transition of a turn from the current speaker to others. Second, it helps hearers to easily understand utterances since it enables the piecemeal transmission of information.","This paper presents a computational model of incremental utterance production in task-oriented dialogues. This model produces utterances to propose the solution of a given problem while simultaneously solving the problem in a stepwise manner. To satisfy time constraints on pauses, this model starts utterances even when the solution has not been fully determined and refines on the solution during the articulation of utterances.","We present the results of an analysis of discourse structure in a corpus of Japanese task-oriented dialogues and show that the fine structure of discourse prevails in spoken dialogues and the predominant discourse structure contributes to the incrementM strategy. Based on such a discourse structure, this model incrementally produces utterances constituting a discourse. However, the incremental strategy is subject to generating irrelevant discourses. To guarantee the relevance of discourses, this model utilizes pragmatic constraints and a context model, which are evaluated in an utterance simulation experiment. 2 Related Research Recent studies of human speech production (Levelt 1989) show that human speakers frequetatly use the incremental strategy of utterance production. This paper is concerned with a computational model of incremental utterance production.","Computational models for the incremental syntactic formulation of a sentence were proposed (Kempen and HoenKamp 1987; De Smedt and Kempen 1991). Although incremental syntactic formulation is an important issue, we do not address this here.","POPEL is a parallel and incremental natural language generation system (Finkler and Schauder 1992; Reithinger 1992). In POPEL, the \"what to say\" component determines the content to be generated and gradually carries it over to the \"how to say\" component, which formulates a sentence incrementally.

Although our model ca,n 1)roduce filler terms and repair prior utterances, our chief concern is the tine structure of spoken discourse, which is closely related to incremental utterance pro(tnction. 3 Discourse Structure Analysis We analyzed the discourse structure in a corpus of task-oriented diah)gues, which were collected by the folh)wing method. The subjects were ninety native Japaimse. In each diah)gue, two subjects, N and E, were ~Lsked to converse by telephone to lind a solution to the l)roblem of how N could get from one place to another. Subjects were chosen such that E had enough knowledge to solve the problem but N did not. Eigilty dialogues were recorded and transcribed. Fifteen dialogues were randomly chosen for analysis. The discourse structure was analyzed in terms of information units and discourse relations. a.1 Analyzing information units Speakers organize tile information to t)e conveyed to information units (Halliday 1994), which are the units for traitsmission of information. The information units (IKs for short) are regarded as minilnal components of discourse structure. We assume that IUs a,re realized by grammatical lievices: a clause realizes an 1 U, an inteljectory word realizes an 1U, and a tiller term shows the end of an IU. Figure 1 shows pa.rt of the transcription of a dialogue where a diahlgue participant prol)oses a domMn l)lan. Tile symbol \"/\" separates the IUs. Table 1: Frequency distribution for information units Clause 929 Interjectory word 665 PP or NP 279 Conjun(:tion 84 Sequence of PPs or NPs 41 Others 14 Total 2012","Tal)le 1 shows the frequency distribution for tim /~ramnlatiea] (:ategoric's of IU, where NP and I'P mean noun 1)hrase and 1)ostl)ositional phrase. '.['he average nmnber of NPs in an IU as a clause, NP, Pl', or sequen(-e of NPs and Pl?s is 1.01 in the tifteen dialogues. The vm'ianee is 0.28.","This reslflt indicates that small IUs are frequently used. For example, althougil IU (1) in Figure 1 descril)es only a part of a domain action, it is regarded as ail IU siil.ce it has a e(/pula (\"desu\") an(1 a sentenee-linal t)article (\"ne\"). 3.2 Analyzing discourse relations Discourse relations between adjacent discourse segments w(,.re examined. A (liscourse segment is an IU or a sequence of IUs. For discourse reta.tions, we here adot)ted those used in Rhetori- (:al Structure Theory (M~nn and Thomt)son 1988) and tlere followed Hovy (1993) to classify them into semantic and interpersonal ones. Figure 2 shows discourse relations tllat appear in the discourse displayed in Figure 1. The small IUs are hierarchically related. This results ill the fine structure of diseom:se.","Table 2 shows tile frequency distributions for discourse relations in tile fifteen diak)gues. Let us consider the role that tile l)redominant relations, Elaboration, Circumstance, and Motivation, l)lay in tile inereinental strategy of utterance t)roduction.* First, Elaboration is exploited to describe domain actions, states or objects in a piecemeal fashion. Elaboration enables speakers to distribute the content to be conveyed among different lUs. '_Ptfis relation is useful for the incremental strategy since it allows speakers to begin uttering even when the content has not been fully determined.","Second, Circumstance is the relation between two segments, a nucleus and a satellite. The m> eleus describes a domain action or state. The satellite describes the circumstances where the m> cleus is interpreted, such as the preconditions of a domain action. There are 41 cases where the satellite describes a precondition of a domain action, which amounts to 68% of all cases. The constituents of a domain action are often referred to in its preconditions. We see ~ typical ease in tile relation l)etween (4) and (5) in Figure 1.

By utilizing this relation, speakers can distribute the content of a domain action between two IUs. They can pick up a constituent of an action and describe it before describing the whole content of the action. Thus Circumstance is useful for the incremental strategy.","Finally, Motivation is mainly used for describing a domain action as a nucleus and motivating addressees to adopt the action by presenting a fact as a satellite. In typical cases, speakers motivate addressees to adopt an action by asserting that its precondition is satisfied. In such cases, Motivation occurs together with Circumstance and contributes to the incrementa.1 strategy in the same way as Circumstance."]},{"title":"4 The Model","paragraphs":["As shown in Figure 3, this model is composed of five modules: a problem solver, an utterance planner, an utterance controller, a text-to-speech converter, and a pause monitor. The problem solver makes domain plans that solve a given problem. The utterance planner makes utterance plans to propose domain plans. Pragmatic constraints and a context model are used to generate relevant discourses. According to utterance plans, the utterance controller sends linguistic expressions to tile text-to-speech converter. The pause monitor watches the length of pauses and signals the utterance planner and controller when the pause length exceeds a given length.","These modules work in parallel. Both domain plans and utterance plans are made in a stepwise manner using the hierarchical planning mechanism (Russel and Norvig 1995: Chap.12).
