The corpus was derived by semi-automatic means from the Penn Treebank; only sentences without conjunction were available (mean length=20, max=68). A randomly selected set of 400 sentences was set aside for testing all models; the rest were used to estimate the model parameters. In the pilot (unlike the full experiment), the parser was instructed to \"back oil\"' from all probabilities with denominators < 10. For this reason, the models were insensitive to most lexical distinctions.","In addition to models A, B, and C, described above, the pilot experiment evaluated two other models for comparison. Model C' was a version of model C that ignored lexical dependencies between parents and children, considering only dependencies between a parent's tag and a child's tag. This model is similar to the model nsed by stochastic CFG. Model X did the same n-gram tagging as models A and B (~. = 2 for the preliminary experiment, rather than n = 3), but did not assign any links.","Tables 1 -2 show the percentage of raw tokens that were correctly tagged by each model, as well as the proportion that were correctly attached to 344 All tokons Ntlll-llllnc NOLIn8 17~1 verbs [ A t~- - (' C r-"]},{"title":"[ L~5..,~ r 8.1S~,,a.~","paragraphs":["47.3"]},{"title":"~l r~ sA rr.~ I '~ 1","paragraphs":["~~-L40:,<~A_ - ~ ~_ 'l'~d)le 2: ]{.csults of preliininary (,Xl)crimcnts: Per. contage of tokens corrc0Lly attached Lo their paronl;s by each model. their parents.
