Actually, relaxation is a family of energy-function-minimizing algorithms closely related to Boltzmann machines, gradient step, and Hopfield nets.","A consistent labelling problem consists of, giwm a set of variables, assigning to each variable a labc'l compatible with the labels of the other ones, according to a set of compatibility constraints.","Many problems can be stated as a labelling problem: the travelling salesman problen 4 n-queens, corner and edge recognition, image smoothing, etc.","In this paper we will try to make a first, insight into applying relaxation labelling to natural language processing. The main idea of the work is that NLP problems such as POS tagging or WSD can be stated as constraint satisfaction problems, thus, they could be addressed with the usual techniques of that field, such as relaxation labelling.","It seems reasonable to consider POS tagging or WSD as combinatorial problenrs in which we have a set of variables (words in a sentence) a set, of possible labels for each one (POS tags or senses), and a set of constraints for these labels. We might also coinbine both problems in only one, and express constraints between the two types of tags, using semantic information to disambiguate POS tags and visceversa. This is not the point; in this paper, but it will be addressed in fllrther work."]},{"title":"2 Relaxation Labelling Algorithm","paragraphs":["Relaxation labelling is a generic name for a family of iterative algorittuns which perform function optimization, based (m local infi~rmation.
