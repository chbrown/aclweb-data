Though the advantages of UGs are obvious in that properties such as monotonicity, declarativity, perspicouity are important for maintaining and easily extending grammars, their popularity (despite 15 years of history) is still restricted to the academia. This paper reports of a project, LS-GRAM, which tried to make a step further in bringing UGs closer to applications. Application-oriented grammar development has to take into account the following parameters:","• Efficiency: A major problem of UGs is (lacking) efficiency.

Thierry Declerek","IMS, University of Stuttgart","Azenbergstr. 12 D-70174 Stuttgart","thierry@ims.uni-stuttgart.de led to the decision to use a so called 'lean' for-nrMism, ALEP, providing efficient term unification. 'Leanness' means that computationally expensive formal constructs are sacrificed to gain efficiency. Though this is at the cost of expressiveness, it is claimed that by 'leanness' 'hnguistic felicity' does not suffer.","• Coverage: Most grammar development projects are not based on an investigation of real texts, but start from 'the linguists\" text book'. This is different here in that a corpus-based approach to granlmar development has been adopted which is the implementation of the sinlple principle that if a grainnlar is supposed to cover reM texts, that the coverage of these texts has to be determined first. The was a corpus investigation in the in the beginning, in the course of which tools have been used and developed which allow for automatic and semi-automatic determination of linguistic phenomena.","• Conlpleteness: All modules needed from text handling to semantics had to ve developed. This is why this paper does not focus on one single topic, but tries to represent the ulajor achievements of the whole of the system.

Figures are given which prove that the system is not so far from real applications 2","2 Corpus-Investigation with the MPRO-System The project started with a corpus investigation. It consisted of 150 newspaper articles from the German 'Die ZEIT'. They are descriptive texts from the domain of economy. They were investigated automatically by the (non-statistical) 'MPRO' tagger. 'MPRO' provides the attachment of rich linguistic information to the words. In addition, 'MPRO' provides a built-in facility for resolving categorial ambiguities on the basis of homograph reductions and a facility for handling unknown words which are written on a file. Encoding the missing stems (which were very few) ensured complete tagging of the corpus. 'MPRO' also provides a facility for searching syntactic structures in corpora. A detailed analysis on the internal structure of main clauses, subordinate clauses, verbal clusters, clausal topoi (e.g. structure of Vorfeld and Nachfeld), NPs, PPs, APs, CARDPs, coordinate structures, occurrence of expletives, pronominals and negation occurring in the corpus was made which then guided grammar development. Another major result of the corpus investigation was that most sentences coutMn so called 'messy details', brackets, figures, dates, proper names, appositions. Most sentences contain compounds. In generM, most of the known linguistic phenomena occur in all known variations. Description has to be done in great &tail (all frames, all syntactic realizations of frames). (Long distant) discontinuities popular in theoretical linguistics did not play a role. In order to give a 'general tlavour' of the corpus-investigation one noteworthy result should be reported: 25% of the number of words occur in NPs of the structure [ DET (A) (A) N ]. But 'A' and 'N' are of a complex and unexpected nature: • A: (name) - er: Dortmund-er, Schweiz-er ® (figure) - A: 5-j/£hrig, ffinfj~hrig, 68-prozentig • N: Ex-DDR-Monopolisten (Hyphenated com-","pounding, including names and abbreviations). The corpus-investigation guided the grantmar developnrent. A.o. it showed the necessity to devlop a TH component and separate out specific phenomena from the treatment in the grannnar. (This was also necessary from an efficiency point of view)."]},{"title":"2It","paragraphs":["should be mentioned that we are referring to the German grammar built in the LS-GRAM project. For other languages similar system exist. 3 Text Handling The ALEP platform provides a TH component which allows \"pre-processing\" of inputs, it converts a number of formats among them 'Latex'. Then the ASCII text first goes through SGML-based tagging: Convertion to an EDIF (Eurotra Document Interchange Format) format, then paragraph recognition, sentence recognition and word recognition. The output of these processes consists in the tagging of the recognized elements: 'P' for paragraphs, 'S' for sentences, 'W' for words (in case of morphological analysis, the tag 'M' is provided for morphemes) and 'PT' for punctuation signs as exelnplified in (1).","(1) <P> <S> <W>Jolm</W> <W>sleeps</W>","<PT>.</PT> </s> </P> In the default case, this is the information which is input to the TH-LS component (Text-Handling to Linguistic Structure) component. ALEP provides a facility (tsls-rules) which allows the grammar writer to identify information which is to flow from the TtI to the linguistic processes. We will show how this facility can be used for all efficient and consistent treatnlent of all kinds of 'messy details'. The TH component of the ALEP platform also foresees the integration of user-defined tags. The tag (USR) is used if the text is tagged by a user-defined tagger. An example of an integration of a user-defined tagger between the sentence recognition level and the word recognition level of the TH tool is given below. The tagger for 'messy details' has been integrated into the German grammar and has been adapted for the following patterns:","1 'Quantities' (a cardinal number followed by an amount and a currency name (e.g. \"16,7 Millionen Dollar\")) 2 Percentages (12%, 12 Prozent, zwSlf Prozent) 3 Dates (20.

The feature 'TYPE' bears the variable TYPE (in our case: \"quantities\"). The feature 'VAL' represents the original input (e.g.: \"ffinfzig Milliarden Dollar\") and the variable STRING represents the output string of the tagged input (in this case: \"fuenfzig_Milharden_Dollar\"). This value is co-shared with the value of the \"string\" feature of the lexicon entry. The definition of such generic entries in the lexicon allows to keep the lexicon smaller but also to deal with a potentially infinite number of words. These strategies were extended to the other phenomena.

We will introduce this component by way of exemplification. (5) represents the treatment of'e'-'i' umlautung as occurring in German verbs like 'gebe', 'gibst', referring to (Trostg0). An ALEP TL rule comes as a four to five place PROLOG term, the first argument being the rule name, the second a TL description, the third (represented by the anonymous variable ) a specifier feature structure, the fourth a typed feature structure constraining the application of the rule and a fifth allowing for linking variables to predeflned character sets."]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["tlm_rule( umlautE_no, [] [el [] <=> [] ['E'] [],","syn:{","constype => stem:{","phenol => pho:{","umlaut => no } } } ). tim_rule( umlautE_i_yes, [3 [i] [C] <=> [] ['E'] [],","syn:{ constype => stem:{","phenol => pho:{","umlaut => (yes,i)} } },","[C in consonants] ).

It contains two features, 'lemma' which encodes the abstract nlorpheme with a capital 'E' (this is the basis for a treatment according to ((Trost90)) and the feature 'phenol' which encodes phonologically relevant information, in this case whether ulnlautung is available or not. The values for 'phenol' is a boolean conjunction from two sets: sl ={none, no, yes} and s2 = {e,"]},{"title":"i].","paragraphs":["The treatment consists of mapping a surface 'e' to a lexical 'E' in case the constraint which is expressed 288 as a feature structure in the fourth argument holds. It says that for the first rule 'e' is nrapped on 'E' if the feature 'umlaut' has a value which is 'no'. This applies to (6). This handles cases such as 'geb-e'. The second rule maps 'i' 'E' if 'umlaut' has the value 'yes & i'. This also holds in cases like 'gib-st'. One would expect according to (Trost90) that only two values 'no' and 'yes' are used. The change has been done for merely esthetic reasons. The '2nd pers sing' morpheme 'st' e.g. requires an 'umlaut = yes' stenr, if the stem is capable of ulnlautung, at all which is the case for 'gibst'. In case the stem cannot have umlautung (as for 'kommst') 'st' also attaches. This makes that uon-unflautung stems have to be left unspecified for umlautung, as other-wise 'st' could not attach. 'st' can now be encoded fox' 'umlaut = no'. 4.2 Lexicon f,exical information is distributed over three lexicons:","• A TL lexicon which contains information relevant for seglnentation, cxdusively. • A syntax lexicon. • A semantic lexicon. The distribution of information over three lexicons has a sinrple reason, namely avoiding lexical anrbiguities at places where they cannot be resolved or where they have inrpact on eificiency. So, e.g. the verbal suffix 't' has lots of interpretations: '3rd pets sing', 2nd pers pl', preterite and more. These ambiguities are NOT introduced in the TLM lexicon as the only effect would be that a great nunlber of scgmentations would go into syntactic analysis. Only then these ambiguities could be resolved on the basis of morphotactic intorlnation. A similar situation holds on syntactic level. There is no point in nmltiplying syntactic entries by their semantic ambiguities and make all of these entries available for analysis. It would result in a desaster ibr efficiency. Semantic reading distinctions thus are put into the (semantic) refinement lexicon. We would like to introduce lexical information for the preposition 'in' by way of illustration.

It shows the functor treatment applied in the German grammar, namely that the functor selects its head-dtr, combines itself with the head-dtr and projects the mother. More specifically: The functor-dtr, indicated by the value 'funct' of the attribute 'subcat' shares the value of the attribute 'selects' with the 'synsem' value of the head-dtr and its 'projects' value with the 'syn' attribute of the mother. The 'head' value is shared between head-dtr and mother, the 'base' value in addition between head-dtr and functor. The subcategorization is shared between head-dtr and mother. The difference to the head-comp schema is that head information comes from the functor, also the semantics. 'subcat' is inherited from the head-dtr. The powerful mechanism comes in by the subcat-feature of the functor which allows for a very detailed specification of the information to be projected. The PS component covers all categories, especially all clausal categories (main clauses, subordinate clauses, relatives), NPs, APs, ADVPs, PPs. 5 'Efficiency' and Performance In this section we would like to address the topic of efficiency. A number of points contributing specifically to efficiency should be summarized here.","• ALEP is designed to support efficiency as far as the formalism ('lean' approach) is concerned. Formal constructs known to be computationally expensive are not available 3.","• Refinement (mentioned already) is a monotonic appfication of phrase structure rules and lexical entries to further featurize (flesh-out with features) a finguis6c structure, established in analysis. If Q1 is the finguistic output structure of the analysis, then Q~ is the output structure of'refinenlent' if Q1 subsumes Q2, i.e. every local tree in Q= and every lexical entry in Q~ is subsumed by a corresponding local tree and a corresponding lexical entry in Q1. Any non-deterministic backtracking algorithm (depth-first) is badly effected by ambiguities as it has to redo repeatedly large amounts of work. In terms of lingware development this means that lexical ambiguities have to be avoided for analysis. As on the other hand lexicalist theories result in an abundance of lexical ambiguities, 'refinement' is a relief. Optimal distribution of inforlnation over analysis and refinement results in a gain of efficiency by several factors of magnitude.",",, Head selections: ALEP allows for user-defined parsing head declarations as \"the most appro-","3It should have been shown in the precious sections that felicitous descriptions are possible anyway."]},{"title":"290","paragraphs":["priate choice of head relations is grammar dependent\" (Alshtl), p.318. On the basis of the user-defined head relations the reflexive transitive closure over head relations is calculated. It has to be made sure that the derived relations are as compact as possible. Optimal choice of head relations pays off in a gain in efficiency by several factors of magnitude.","• Keys: Keys are values of attributes within linguistic descriptions defined by path declarations. Keys allow for indexation and efficient retrieval of rules and lexical entries. This beconres extremely relevant for larger-scale resources. A key declaration which the grammar developer may do identifies the atomic value which is to serve as a key. Optimal keys again result in a substantial gain in efficiency.","• Last not least tuning the grammars with a view oil efficiency has contributed to tile current performance of the system. In the following we would like to give some actual figures which may illustrate performance. These figures are not meant to be an exact measurement as exact measurenrents are not available, in order to give an indication it may be said that ALL the phenomena which increase indeterminism in a grammar of German are covered: All forms of the articles ('die', 'der') and homomorphous relative pronouns, all readings of verbs ( all frames, all syntactic realizations of complements), semantic readings, prepositions and honu)lnorphous prefixes, PPs as nominal adjuncts, as preadjectival complements, as adjuncts to adverbs, as VP adjuncts, valent nouns (with optional complementation), all readings of Gerlnan 'sein', coordination, N -~ N combinations, relatives, Nachfeld. One result of the corpus investigation was that 95% of the sentences in the corpus have between 5 and 40 words. The grammar is able to parse sentences with up to 40 words in 120 sees. The following are corpus examples containing time-consmning parse problems.

We can summarize briefly:","• ALEP provides all modules and tools from text handling to discourse processing (the latter not introduced here). The lingware created is es: pecially interesting ill that it provides an integrated design for all the modules.","• The formalism for lingware development is lean, but it provides sufficient means to support mainstream felicitous linguistic descriptions.","• Efficiency is good compared to other unification-based systems. It is not yet ready for immediate commercial applications, but it is neither very far away.","• The corpus-based approach to grammar development is the only realistic way to get closer to a coverage that is interesting from all application point of view. ALEP is a promising platform for development of large-scale application-oriented grammars."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Iliyan Alshawi, Arnold D J, Backofen R, Carter D M, Lindop J, Netter K, Pulman S G, Tsujii J and Uszkoreit H, (1991),"]},{"title":"Eurotra ET6/I: Rule Formali,~m and Virtual Machine Design Study (Final Report),","paragraphs":["CEC 1991.
