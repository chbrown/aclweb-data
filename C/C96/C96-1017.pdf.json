Analyses display the root, pattern and all other affixes together with feature tags in-dicating part of speech, person, number, mood, voice, aspect, etc. The system is based on lexicons and rules from an earlier KIMMO-style two-level morphological system, reworked extensively using Xerox Finite-State Morphology tools. The result is an Arabic Finite-State Lexical Transducer that is applied with the same runtime code used for English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Italian lexical tran~ ducers. 1 Introduction 1.1 Challenges of Arabic Morphology Semitic languages like Arabic present unusual challenges to automatic morphological analysis and generation.

Because in orthographical words these root consonants or radicals are usually surrounded, and even split up, by other consonant letters, and because the radicals themselves may be modified by assimilation or even deleted entirely in a written word, root identification and dictionary lookup are significant challenges for learners and native speakers alike."]},{"title":"2 Goals","paragraphs":["To be interesting in our applications, the Arabic morphology system had to have the following qualities:","1. It had to deal with real Arabic surface orthography, as represented on-line in standards such as ASMO 449 or the Macintosh Arabic code page (ISO8859-6). While it is possible to devise strict roman transliterations of Arabic orthography that are unambiguously convertible back and forth into real Arabic orthography, most existing romanizations are in fact transcriptions that contain more or less information than the original and so represent different orthographical systems.","2. It had to be able to analyze Arabic words as they appear in real texts. This means timt input words may be fully voweled or diacriticized (i.e. supplied with full diacritical markings, a style of writing found only in religious texts, poetry, and writings in-tended for children and other learners), par-tially diacriticized or undiacriticized, which is the normal case. A single system had to handle undiacriticized words and yet be able to take advantage of any diacritics that might be present.","3. To facilitate lookup of words in printed and on-line dictionaries, and for pedagogical purposes, the system had to return the root as an easily distinguished part of the analysis. An easier to build, but less useful, system would simply deal with complete stems rather than roots and patterns.","4. The system had to be large and open-ended, with each root coded to restrict the patterns with which it can in fact co-occur.","5. It had to be efficient and accurate, successfully analyzing hundreds or thousands of words per second on commonly available workstations and higher-end PCs.","6. It had to perform efficient and accurate generation of valid surface forms when supplied with the component root and relevant feature tags. Analysis and generation had to be straightforward inverse operations. Forest of Lexicon \"Letter Trees\" Trees are connected by \"continuation classesY A letter path through the trees is an abstract word. Rules hand-compiled into FSTs The intersection of the rules is simulated in code. Rules allow and control the discrepancies between the abstract words in the lexicon and the surface words being analyzed. Figure 2: Traditional Kimmo-Style System Architecture 3 History In 1989 and 1990, with colleagues at ALPNET (Beesley, 1989; Beesley, Buckwalter and Newtoil, 1989; Buckwalter, 1990; Beesley, 1990), I built a large two-level morphological analyzer for Arabic using a slightly enhanced implementation of KIMMO-style two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983, 1984; Gajek, 1983; Karttunen, 1983). Traditional two-level morphology (see Figure 2), as in the publicly available PC-KIMMO implementation (Antworth, 1990), allows only concatenation of morphemes in the morphotacties. Lexicons are stored and manipulated at runtime as a forest of letter trees, with each trec typically containing a single class of morphemes, with the leaves connected to subsequent morpheme trees via a system of \"continuation classes\". A letter path through the lexieal trees from a legal start-ing state to a final leaf defines an abstract or \"lexical\" string. The various two-level rules, which had to be hand-compiled into finite-state transducers, were run in parallel by code that simulated their intersection. The rules allowed and controlled the variations between the lexical strings and the surface strings being analyzed: thus the Arabic surface word wdrsl (~5,~ja ~) could be matched with the lexical string wa+daras+al, among others, via appropriate rules.","In the ALPNET Arabic system, roots and pat= terns were stored in separate trees in the lexical forest, and an algorithm, called Detouring, per-formed the interdigitation of semitic roots and patterns into stems at runtime. The other chal-90 lenges of Arabic morphological w~riation and orthography, including varying amounts of diacritical marking, all succmnbed to rather complex but conq)letely traditional two-level rules. Whih\" the resulting system was successfidly sold and is also currently being used as the morphological engine of an Arabic project at the University of Maryland, it suffers from many well-known limitations of traditional two-level morphology.","1. As there was no automatic rulc compiler available to us, the rules had to bc compiled into tinite-state transducers t)y hand, a tedious task that often influences the linguist to simplify the rules by postulating a rather surfacy lexical level. Hand-compilation of a complex rule, which can easily take hours, is a real disincentive to change and experimentation.","2. Because there was no algorithm to intersect the rule transduccrs, over 100 of them in the ALPNET system, thcy are stored separately and must each be consulted separately at each step of the analysis. As the time necessary to move a rule transduccr to a new state is usually independent of its size, moving 100 transducers at runtimc cat, be 100 times slower than moving a single intersected transducer.","3. Because the lexical letter trccs in a traditional Kimmo-style system are dccoratcd with glosses, features and other miscellaneous information on the leaves, they are not purc finite-state machines, cannot bc combined into a single fsm, cannot be composed with the rules, and have to be storcd and run as separate data structures.","4. Various diacritical fcatures inscrted into the lexical strings to insurc proper analyses made this and other KIMMO-stylc systems awkward or in,practical for generation.","5. Finally, in the enhanced ALPNI,;T implementation, the storage of almost 5000 roots and hundreds of patterns it, separate sul)lcxicons saved memory space, but the l)etouring operation that interdigitatcd them in rcaltime was inherently inelficient, building and then throwing away many superficially plausible sterns that were not sahctioned by the lexicon codings. (Any Arabic root (:at, combine legally with only a small subset of the possible patterns.) With building phantom stems and the unavoidable backtracking caused by the overall deficiency and ambiguity of written Arabic words, the resulting system was rather slow, analyzing about 2 words per second on a small IBM mainframe.

The ALPNET lexicons were first converted into the format of lexc, the lexicon c()mpiler (Karttnnen and Beesley, 1992). Althongil lexc by itself is largely limited to concatcnative morphotactics, just like traditional two-level morphology, it was noted that the interdigitation of semitic roots and patterns is nothing more or less than their intersection, an operation supported in the Xerox finite-state calculus. Thus if ? represents any letter, and C represents any radical (consonant), the root drs (tY' -) ~) can be interpreted as ?*d?*r?*s?*.","The intersection of this root with the pattern CaCaC yields the stem daras (ty,55). See Figure 3.","In s()mc analyses (e.g. McCarthy, 1981), the voweling of the pattern is also abstracted out, leaving pattern templatcs like CVCVC and a vocalic element that cat, bc formalized as ?*a?*a?*. If V represents a vowel, then the intersection of the root, ten,plate and vocalic elements yields the same result. See Figure 4.","Using standard Ol)crations availablc through the lexc compiler and other finite-state tools, the analysis can be constructed according to the taste and necds of the linguists.","Because the upper-side string is returned as the result of an anMysis, it is often more helpful to define the upper-side string as a baseform (here a root) folh,wed by a set of symbol tags designed to represent relevant morphosyntactic features of the attalysis. For examph', daras (O,)~) happens to be the Form 1 perfect active stem based on the root drs (tY) a, with CVCVC being the Form 91 Abstract lexical level: drs+FormI+Perfect+Active Abstract intermediate level: drs+CVCVC+aa Abstract intersected level: daras Figure 5: Root drs with CVCVC Template and Active Voweling Abstract lexical level: drs+Forml+Perfect+Passive Abstract intermediate level: drs+CVCVC+ui Abstract intersected level: duris Figure 6: Root drs with CVCVC Template and Passive Voweling I pattern and the vocal element aa representing active voice. The stem duris (~.r,9.~), using the passive voweling ui is the parallel passive example. If +FormI, +Perfect, +Active and +Passive are defined as single symbols, and if +FormI+Perfect maps to CVCVC, and if +Active maps to aa and +Passive to ui, the analyses can be constructed as in Figures 5 and 6.","After composition of the relevant transducers, the intermediate levels disappear, resulting in a direct mapping between the upper and lower levels shown. The resulting single transducer is called the lexicon transducer.","All valid stems, currently about 85,000 of them, are automatically intersected, at compile time, at one level of the analysis. Suitable prefixes and suffixes are also present in the lexicon transducer, added in the normal concatenative ways.","Stems like davas (t.r,33) and duris (tg4~), and especially those like banay (~.') based on \"weak\" roots, are still quite abstract and idealized compared to their ultimate surface realizations. Finite-state rules rules map the idealized strings into surface strings, handling all kinds of epentheses, deletions and assimilations. The twolc rule compiler (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) is able not only to recompile the rules automatically but to intersect them into a single rule fst. This rule fst is then composed on the bottom of the lexi-Lexicon FST *O.

The symbol .o. in Figure 7 indicates composition.","Another transducer is also composed on top of the lexicon fst to map various rule-triggering features, no longer needed, into epsilon and to enforce various long-distance morphotactic restrictions. All intermediate levels disappear in the compositions, and one is left with a single two-level lexical transducer that contains surface strings on tim bottom and lexical strings, including roots and tags, on the top. A typical transduction is shown in Figure 8, where the final t (~) is the surface realization of the third-person feminine singular suffix -at. Fully voweled, the surface string for this reading would be darasat ( -,~a33 ). Because short vowels are seldom written in surface words, dvst is also analyzed as the Form I perfect passive third-person singular, which would be fully roweled as dnrisat ( \",~ ~.~), and as several other forms.","At runtime, strings being analyzed are simply matched along paths on the bottom side of the lexical transducer, and the solution strings are read off of the matching top side. Like all finite-state transducers, it also generates as easily as it analyzes, literally by running the transducer \"back-92 Lexical Cleanup Transducer oO* Lexicon Transducer .o.

The Arabic system is, however, substantially slower than the. other languages, t)ecause the ambiguity of the surface words forces many dead-end analysis paths to be explored and because more valid solutions have to be found and returned. The mismatch between the concatenated root and pattern on the lexical side and the intersected stem on the lower side also creates an Arabic system that is substantially larger than the other languages."]},{"title":"5 Generation","paragraphs":["A single underlying Arabic word may be spelled many ways on the surface, depending on how coinplctely the writer specilies the diacritics. Because the system described above recognizes all possible written forms of a word, with varying degrees of diacritical marking, it also generates all the possible surface forms of a word, which may be less than useful in many applications, q'yi)ically, a user wants to see only the fidly vowcled form dur-ing generation.","The Arabic rules have now been modilied to work in two steps, lirst to generate the fully voweled form, and then to generate the various par-tially roweled forms and the unvoweled form.","Where desired, the lexicon fst can be composed with only the upper set of rules to make a lexical transducer that gencratcs (and recognizes) only fully-roweled surface forms, l,'or general recognition, both sets of rules, a.s shown in Figure 9, are composed. The result is equivalent to the original lexical transducer described in Figure 7."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Arabic morphology, though considerably more difficult than the morphology found in the commonly studied European languages, is fully susceptible to finitc-state analysis techniques, either in an enhanced two-level morphology or in the mathematically equiwdent but much more cornputationally efficient Xerox finite-state format.
