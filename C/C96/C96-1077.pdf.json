However, there is at least one serious rival two-level notation in existence, developed in response to practical difficulties encountered in writing large-scale morphological descriptions using Koskenniemi's notation. Tile formalism was first introduced in (Black et al., 1987), was adapted by (Ruessink, 1989), and an extended version of it was proposed for use in the European Commission's ALEP language engineering platform (Pulman, 1991). A flmther extension to the formalisln was described in (Pulman and Hepple, 1993).","The alternative partition tbrmalism was motivated by several perceived practical disadvan- *Supported by SERC studentship no. 92313384. tSupported by a Benefactors' Studentship from St","John's College. rages to Koskenniemi's notation. These are detailed more fully in (Black et al., 1987, pp. 13-15), and in (Ritchie et al., 1992, pp. 181-9). In brief: (1) Koskennienli rules are not easily interpretable (by tile grammarian) locally, for the interpretation of 'feasible pairs' depends on other rules in the set. (2) There are frequently interactions between rules: whenever the lexieal/surface pair affected by a rule A appears in tile context of another rule B, the grammarian must check that its appearance in rule B will not conflict with the requirements of rule A. (3) Contexts may conflict: the same lexical character may obligatorily have multiple realisa-tions in different contexts, but it may be impossible to state the contexts in ways that do not block a desired application. (4) Restriction to single character changes: whenever a change affecting more than one adjacent character occurs, multiple rules nmst be written. At best this prompts tile interaction problem, and at worst can require the rules to be forInulated with under-restrictive contexts to avoid mutual blocking. (5) There is no mechanism for relating particular rules to specific classes of morpheme. This has to be achieved indirectly by introducing special abstract trigger-ing characters in lexical representations. This is clumsy, and sometimes descriptively inadequate ('h'ost, 1990).","Some of these problems can be alleviated by the use of a rule compiler that detects conflicts such as that described in (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992). Others could be overcome by simple extensions to the tbrmalism. But several of these problems arise from the interpretation of Koskenniemi rules: each rule corresponds to a transducer, and the two-level description of a language consists of the intersection of these transducers. Thus some-how or other it must be arranged that every rule accepts every two-level correspondence. We refer 1;o this class of formalisms as 'parallel': every rule, in effect, is applied ill parallel at each point in the input. 454","The partition tbrmalism coImists of two types of rules (defined in more detail beh)w) which enforce optional or obligatory changes. Tl~e notion of well-formedness is defined via the notion of a 'partition' of a sequence of lexical/surface correspondences, informally, a partition is a valid analysis if (i) every element of the t)artition is licensed by an optional rule, and (ii) no element of the partition violates an obligatory rule.","We have tbund that this formalism has some practical adwmtages: (1) The rules are relatively independent ot: each other. (2) Their interpretation is more familiar for linguists: each rule copes with a single correspondence: in general you don't have to worry about all other rules having to t)e (:ompatible with it. (3) Multiple character changes art permitted (with some restrictions discussed below). (4) A category or term associated with each rule is requi,'e(t to uni(y with the affected morpheme, allowing for morI)ho-synta(:tic etfects to be cleanly described. (5) There ix a simple and etfMent direct interpreter for tt,e rule forrnalism.","Tile partition formalism has been implemented in the European Commission's ALEP system tbr natural language engineering, distributed to over 30 sites.

It is this require-ment which makes the compilation procedures in the Koskemfiemi formalism - described in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) - inconvenient. 'The multiple application of a given rule', they state, 'will turn out to be the major source of difficulty in expressing rewriting rules in terms of regular relations and finite-state transducers' (p. 346). The same difficulty applies to two-level rules.","Consider R1 and R2 (§2.1), and D = {(V,V>, <B,b)}.

They resolve this by using auxiliary symbols: (1) They introduce left and right context brackets, <k and >k, for each context pair lk - rk of a specific centre which take the place of the contexts.
