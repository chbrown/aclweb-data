We show that, instead of enumerating the various syntactic constructions they enter into, with the different senses which arise, it is possible to give them a rich typed semantic representation which will explain both their semantic and syntactic polymorphism. 1 Introduction Recently, work in computational semantics and lexical semantics has made an interesting shift. Motivated by a concern for lexical organization and global coherence in the structure of lexicon, some researchers have moved towards nlore expressive semantic descriptions, as well as more powerful methods of combining them (see for example Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995; Briscoe, 1993).","This article will exploit one of these theories, The Generative Lezicon (GL: Pustejovsky, 1995), and extend it for the treatment of French mental adjectives. The following section summarizes the problematic behaviour of these adjectives. The GL approach is then described, and a GL analysis of the data. 2 The Data Mental adjectives which denote an emotional state or a competence (agent-oriented, following Ernst, 1983) present interesting syntactic and semantic polymorphic behaviour, as noted in the literature (see for example Leh~er, 1990 and Croft, 1984). In this paper, we focus on the representative members of these classes in I and Ih We would like to thank James Pustejovsky for extensire discussions on the data presented in this article. Thanks also to Laurence Danlos and Graham Russell for their conunents.","I Emotional adjectives: triste 'sad', furieuz 'angry, furious', irritg 'irritated', heureuz 'happy', ennuyg 'bored'.","II Agent-orlented adjectives: intelligent, ingdnieuz 'clever', habile 'skilful', adroit 'dextrous'. Both classes of adjectives exhibit the property of syntactic polyvalency, being able to appear in several distinct contexts, with optional complement structures (as illustrated in (1), (2) and (3)). In the case of agent-oriented adjectives, the complement expresses the manifestation of the state and call be realized as an infinitive with d/pour or de (examples (2a,b)) or a prepositional phrase (2c): (2a,b,c)means that somebody is skilful in what he does or how he does it (see Croft, 1984).","(1) Cet homme est triste/habile/furieux \"This man is sad/clever/angry TM","(2) a. Cet homme est habile de partir","\"This man is skilful to leave\" b. Cet homme est habile £/pour tricher","\"This man is skilful at cheating\" c. Cet homme est habile au bridge","\"This man is skilful at bridge\"","In the case of emotional state adjectives, this complement typically expresses the cause of the emotional state and may be realized as an de-infinitive or a que-sentence: (3a,b), for example, means that somebody is sad/angry because of something. Notice however that, in some contexts, the complement can also refer to the manifestation of the state, as for agent-orlented adjectives (3c).","(3) a. Cet homme est triste/furieux de partir \"This man is sad/angry to leave\"","b. Cet homme cst triste/furieux que tu partes \"This man is sad/angry that you are leaving\" 1 We give in quotes a literal translation of the French examples. 143","c. Cet hoInme est triste en jouant an piano \"This man is sad at playing piano\"","Another property exhibited by these adjectives is that of multiple semantic selection: that is, they are able to predicate of different semantic types (examples (4) to (7)), namely nouns denot-ing individuals (the 'a' examples), objects (b) and events (c). This can however not be generalized to the whole class of mental states adjectives, as shown by (7), for example.","(4) a. Un homme triste \"A sad man\" b. Un livre triste \"A sad book\" e. Un examen triste \"A sad exam\"","(5) a. Un homme furieux \"An angry man\" b. Un livre furieux \"A furious book\" c. Une destruction furieuse \"A furious de-","struction\"","(6) a. Un homme ingdnieux \"A clever man\" b. Un livre ing6nieux \"An clever book\" c. Un examen ing~nieux \"An clever exam\"","(7) a. Un homme irritfi/ennuyfi","\"An irritated/bored man\" b. *Un livre irrit~/ennuy6","\"An irritated/bored book\" c. *Une destruction irritde/ennuyfi","\"An irritated/bored destruction\"","Finally, the third interesting property manifested by these adjectives is their pattern of polysemy. They exhibit different senses depending on the semantic type of the item modified: when they predicate of an individual, they normally denote the mental state of this individual (8) (but see example (12)).","(8) Un homme triste/ing~nieux/furieux \"A sad/clever/angry nlan\" -~ which is in a sad/clever/angry state","When they modify an event or an object, they can take either a causative (gb) or a manifestation sense (9c, 10e and 11c). In the former case, the object or event is the cause of the stat% while in the latter it is the manifestation of the state. In some specific contexts, the causative sense is also possible with individuals (12).","(9) Un livre/voyage triste \"A sad book/travel\" a. -- *which is in a state of sadness b. -~ which causes somebody to be sad c. --~ which is a nranifestation ofsomebody's","sadness","(10) Un livre/voyage ingfinieux \"A clever book/journey\" a. ~ *which is in a state of cleverness b. -~ *which causes somebody to be clever e. -~ which is a manifestation of the some-","body's cleverness","(11) Un(e) livre/destrnction furienx(se) \"A furious book/destruction\" a. --, *which is in a state of anger b. --~ *which causes somebody to be angry e. -~ which is a manifestation ofsomebody's","anger","(12) Un holnnle triste h voir \"A sad man to see\" a. -~ *who is in a state of sadness b. ~ the sight of whom causes somebody to","be sad","A complication arises with respect to the pol-","ysemous behaviour of emotion adjectives, in that","when they modify an object or an event (9, 10),","they can have both the causal and the manifesta-","tion senses (gb,e).

In partitular, instead of enumerating all syntactic constructions and the different senses for these adjectives, we will provide a rich typed semantic representation which explains both the semantic and the syntactic polymorphism associated with these classes.

The qualia structure we proposed in (15) and (16) makes explicit the links between the ditl~rent senses of mental adjectives (mental state of an individual, causative and manifestation). In (15), the qualia structure specifies that emotional states are caused by a causal event and can have a further manifestation; in (16), that the agent-oriented state can have a fnrther manifestation.","(c) Explaining the semantic selection of mental state adjectives. The specific semantic selection of mental adjectives follows from the headcdness system.","(d) Distinguishing two kinds of adjectives: those which denote simple type (rouge (red), grand (big), etc.) and those like mental adjectives which denote dotted type. This distinction is in accordance with the classical distinction drawn between stative adjectives and dynamic ones, which, following Quirk et al., 1994:434, denote qualities that are thought to be subject to control by possessor. GL allows this distinction to be characterized and given a more formal representation, an adjective being dynamic if it refers to the cause or its further manifestation. References","J.C.
