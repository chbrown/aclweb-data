The paper provides a new computational analysis of root-and-pattern morphology based on prosody. 1 Introduction Prosodic Morphology (McCarthy and Prince, 1986, et seq.) provides adequate means for describing non-linear phenomena such as infixation, reduplication and templatic morphology. Standard two-level systems proved to be cumbersome in describing such operations - see (Sproat, 1992, p. 159 ft.) for a discussion. Multi-tape two-level morphology (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994, et. seq.) addresses various issues in the domain of non-linear morphology: It has been used in analysing root-and-pattern morphology (Kiraz, 1994), the Arabic broken plural phenomenon (Kiraz, 1996a), and error detection in non-concatenative strings (Bowden and Kiraz, 1995). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how non-linear operations which are motivated by prosody can also be described within this framework, drawing examples from Arabic.","The analysis of Arabic presented here differs from earlier computa[ional accounts in that it employs new linguistic descriptions of Arabic morphology, viz. moraic and affixational theories (Mc-Carthy and Prince, 1990b; McCarthy, 1993). The former argues that a different vocabulary is","Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from St John's College. This research was done under the supervision of Dr Stephen G. Pulman. needed to represent the pattern morpheme according to the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis (see §1:1), contrary to the earlier CV model where templates are represented as sequences of Cs (consonants) and Vs (vowels). The latter departed radically from the notion of root-and-pattern morphology in the description of the Arabic verbal stem (see §3).","The choice of the linguistic model depends on the application in question and is left for the grammarian. Tile purpose here is to demonstrate that multi-tape two-level morphology is adequate for representing these various linguistic models.","The following convention has been adopted. Morphemes are represented in braces, { }, and surface forms in solidi, / /. In listings of grammars and lexica, variables begin with a capital letter.","The structure of the papcr is as follows: Sec-tion 2 demonstrates how Arabic templatic morphology can be analysed by prosodic terms, and section 3 looks into infixation; finally, section 4 provides some concluding remarks. The rest of this section introduces prosodic morphology and establishes the computational framework behind this presentation. 1.1 Prosodic Morphology There are three essential principles in prosodic morphology (McCarthy and Prince, 1990a; Mc-Carthy and Prince, 1993). They are:","(i) a. PROSODIC MORPHOLOGY HYPOTHE-SIS. Templates are defined in terms of the authentic units of prosody: mora (it), syllable (~), foot (Ft), prosodic word (PrWd).","b. TEMPLATE SATISFACTION CONDI-TION. Satisfaction of templates constraints is obligatory and is determined by the principles of prosody, both universal and language-specific. 664","c. PROSODIC CIRCUMSCRIPTION. The domain to which morphological operations apply may be circumscribed by prosodic criteria as well as by the more familiar morphological ones.","In the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis, morn is the unit of syllabic weight; a monomoraic syllable, oh, , is light (L), and a bimoraic syllable, a~,~, is heavy (H). The most common types of syllables are: open light, CV, open heavy, CVV, and closed heavy, CVC. This typology is represented graphically in (2). G (7 (7 CV CVV CVC Association of Cs and Vs to templates is based on the Template Satisfaction Condition. Association takes the following form: a node a always takes a C, and a morn # takes a V; however, in bimorale syllables, the second # may be associated to either a C or a V}","Prosodic Circumscription (PC) defines the domain of morphological operations. Normally, the domain of a typical morphological operation is a grammatical category (root, stem or word), resulting in prefixation or sufilxation. Under PC, however, the domain of a morphological operation is a prosodically-delimited substring within a grammatical category, often resulting in some sort of infixation. The essential for PC is a parsing function ~I~ of the form in (3). (3) PARSING FUNCTION"]},{"title":"+(c, E)","paragraphs":["Let B be a base (i.e. stem or word). The function ~I~ returns the constituent C that sits on the edge E E {right, left) of the base B. The result is a factoring of B into: kernel, designated by B:~, which is the string returned by the parsing function, and residue, designated by B/O, which is the remainder of B. The relation between B:~ and B/~ is given in (4), where ~ is the concatenation operator.","(4) FACTORING OF B BY (I) B = B:~ ~ B/,~ To illustrate this, let B = /katab/; applying the function O(al,, Left) on B factors it into: (i) the kernel B:~ = /ka/, and (ii) the residue","1Other conventions associate consonant melodies left-to-right to the morale nodes, followed by associating vowel melodies to syllable-initial morae.","= /tab/.","A morphological operation O (e.g. O = \"Prefix {t}\") defined on a base B is denoted by O(B). There are two types of PC: positive (PPC) and negative (NPC). In PPC, the domain of the operation is tile kernel B:,IJ; this type is denoted by O:~ and is defined in (5a). In NPC, the domain is the residue B/O; this type is denoted by 0/4) and is defined in (5b).","(5) DEFINITION OF PPC AND NPC a. PPC, O:O(B) : O(B:~) ~ B/O b. NPC, O/O(B) = B:O ~ O(B/,I~) In other words, in PPC, O applies to the kernel B:~, concatenating the result with the residue B/O; in NPC, O applies to the residue B/O, concatenating the result with the kernel B:O. Examples are provided in section 3. 1.2 Multi-Tape Two-Level Formalism Two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) defines two levels of strings in recognition and synthesis: lexical strings represent morphemes, and surface strings represent surface forms. Two-level rules map the two strings; the rules are compiled into finite state transducers, where lexical strings sit on one tape of the transducers and surface strings on the other.","Multi-tape two-level morphology is an extension to standard two-level morphology, where more than one lexical tape is allowed. The notion of using multiple tapes first appeared in (Kay, 1987). Motivated by Kay's work, (Kiraz, 1994) proposed a multi-tape two-level model. The model adopts the formalism in (6) as reported by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993).","LLC LEX RLC {::~, ~} (6) LSC - SURI,' RSC where LLC is the left, lexical context, LEX is the lexical form, RLC is the right lexical context, LSC is the left surface context, SURF is the surface form, and RSC is the right surface context.","The special symbol * indicates an empty context, which is always satisfied. The operator =~ states that LEX may surface as SURF in the given context, while the operator <=~ adds the condition that when LEx appears in the given context, then the surface description must satisfy SuR~. The latter caters for obligatory rules. A lexical string maps to a surface string iff (1) they call be partitioned into pairs of lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair is licenced by a rule, and (2) no partition violates an obligatory rule. 665","One of the extensions introduced in the multi-tape version is that all expressions in the lexical side of the rules (i.e. LLC, LEx and RLC) are n-tuple of regular expressions of the form (xl, x2, ..., xn). The ith expression refers to symbols on the ith tape. When n = 1, the parentheses can be ignored; hence, (x) and x are equivalent. 2"]},{"title":"2 Templatic Morphology","paragraphs":["Templatic morphology is best exemplified in Semitic root-and-pattern morphology. This section sets a framework under which templatic morphology can be described using (augmented) two-level theory. Our presentation differs from previous proposals a in that it employs prosodic morphology in the analysis of Arabic, rather than earlier CV accounts.
