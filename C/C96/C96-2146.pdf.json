In ALT-J/E, Japanese sentence analysis is performed based on lhe wdency slruclure for the predicalc of the input sentence. ALT-J/E c~m trm~slate several special Japm~ese constntclions such as predicate idioms and funclion verb expressions (Oku, 1992). The Jap~mese double-subject conslntclion was nol handled well by the original ALT-J/E. This paper describes a melhod lbr mmlyzing a Japanese double-subject construction having an ad.i eclivet)rcdicate bascd on Ihe valency structure.","Simple sentences normally have only one sub.icctivc case in most languages. However, it is possible for many Japlmese adjectives (and so me verbs) to dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence structure is called lhe double-subject construction. JEiDA (Ihe Japan Elcclronic Industry Development Associalion) has issued evaluation st~mdards for machine lnmslation systems (JEIDA, 1995). ~Ihe main aim of lhese standards is to establish objective test sets for machine translation system evaluation. Therefore, they include ahnost of all linguislic phenomena flu,l the systems have to process. In lhc slandards, the double-subject eonslruclion is listed as one of the conslruclions lhat arc difficult lo process successfidly.","Many Japmlesephilologistshavesludicdthc double-subject construction because it is necessary to reveal the synlaclic or scmmltic structure of lhis construction if wc are to establish a syntactic or sem~ullic lheo~, lor the Japanese language (lshigami, 1977) (Kuno, 1973) (Mikami, 1961)). However, there arc a few sludies for processing this conslmction from lhe point of view of computational linguislics or engineering (Mttrala, 1990). ~llmrelbrc, lhc aim of lhis paper is to discuss a melhod for ;malyzing lhc Japanese double-subject constnlction havhlg an adjective predicate from lhe point of view of engineering. 2 Definition of key terms Key terms used in this paper me defined as follows: • case-marldng particle In English, each case is marked by its relative posilion in terms of tile predicate or by a preposition. In contrast to lhis, Japanese language marks each case by a certain sort of postposilional parlicle located next to noun phvases sudl as \"ga\" or \"we\". Such particles arc callcd \"case-markiu g pm-ticl es\". • adverbial particle \"Adverbial particles\" give a case an additional function (topicalizalion etc.) by their allachmenl to Ibc cascmarkingparlicle. Some adverbial particles such as \"wa\" or \"me\" often stand-in for case-marking parlicles and give the case ;m additional fimclion. • sentence having an adjective predicate In the Japanese I~mguage, adjectives function as predicates in sentences as do verbs, qlmrefore, in this paper, lhe sentence in which m~"]},{"title":"adjective","paragraphs":["acts as a predicate is called a \"senlence having an Mieclive predicate\". . double-sul;jeet construction Usually, a simple sentence has only one subjeclivc case. ttowevcr, m~my Japanese adjeclives (and some 865 verbs) can dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence structure is called tile \"double-subject constrnction\". This constn~ction includes both adverbial particle \"wa\" and subjective case-marking p~trticle \"ga\". Therefore, the Japanese double-subject construction is also referred to as file \"wa\"-\"ga\" construction. • valency structure The sentence structure can be considered as a combination of a predicate and its modifiers. Such sentence stntcturc is called the \"valency structure\". The valency structure represents what surface cases the modifiers dominated by a given predicate correspond to. • valency pattern \"Valency patterns\" are stnlcture patterns that formulate possible valency structures for predicates. A valency pattern is defined for each usage for each predicate. Figure 1 shows an example of a valency pattern for a verb \"shoukai sunl (introduce)\". For vcrbs and adjectives, wdcncy patterns formulated as shown in figure 1 are collect ed beforehand in the dictionary called the valency pattern dictionary.","Japanese valency pattern tbr \"~,~ 9']\" J-~\"","N1 ] SR: [(agent)]","(suljective) ] JR: 73\";, h \"~ ~J","N2 ] SR: [(agent)]","N3 | SR: [(agent)l","(objective2)] JR: ~ Remarks: Ni: Label for a valency element SR: Semantic restriction on a noun JR: Restriction on case-marking particles","Figure 1. An example of a valency pattern. • valency element In the valency stn~cture, each relation between a predicate and its modifier is called a \"valency element\". As shown in figure I, valency elements are described using both the semantic restriction on the noun including the modifier and the restriction on the case-marking pmaicles including the modifier. • sentence analysis (or analyzing a sentence) \"Sentence analysis\" is the process that reveals the valency structure of the input sentence. ALT-J/E perfonns sentence analysis by binding the modifiers for the predicate in the input sentence to the valency elements in the wtiency pattern for the predicate in the wdency pattern dictionary. • semantic category A \"semantic category\" is a class for dividing nouns into concepts according to their meaning. For example, both \"man\" and \"woman\" belong to the same semantic category [(human)]. In the below, the words surrounded by 1( )] are semantic categories.","3 Japanese Sentence Analysis based on the valency structure Figure 2 outlines the translation process in ALT-J/E (Hayashi, 1987). Morphological analysis segments the input Japanese sentence into its component words such as predicates and nouns. Dependency analysis determines the dependency structure to indicate the association between words. From the association between a predicate and its modifiers in the dependency structure, sentence analysis tries to determine the wflency strncture, i.e., it determines, for the valency pattern for the predicate, which valency element ead~ modifier corresponds to. This valency stnlcture is then converted into the equivalent English sentence structure. Finally, the outpnt English sentence is generated from the stnlcture.","Input Japanese sentence [Moq~hological analysis]~-]apanese dictional\"~y~","Dictionary about [ [Dependency analysis j . .

All valency patterns for each usage with each predicate are prepared beforehand and held in the valency pattern dictionary.. As shown in figure 1, for each predicate, both file semantic restriction on a noun including its modifier and file restrictions on case-marking particles including its modifier are described for each valency element. When the modifier in the input sentence satisfies both restrictions for a certain wllency element in the valency pattern for the predicate, the modifier is botmd to that valency element. The valency smlctnre is determined by binding all predicate modifiers to valency elements. An adverbial particle can correspond to more than one case-marking pataicle, for example, \"wa\" is a possible proxy for \"ga\", \"wo\", \"hi\" and so on. Therefore, sentence analysis first tries to bind modifiers that have case-marking particles, each of which represents which case is unambiguously marked by particle spelling like \"ga\" 866","Japanese input sentence: ~Lt:kg.L~L'~L:/)))~;~{7'~ b-l-<o (he introduced his sister to me) ¢ morphological analysis and dependency analysis dependency structure",".~ refer to valency pattern","sentence analysis","as ordinary construction","~r","valelley strilt'|lll'e (-J ~(~ Ji\""]},{"title":"\"I- %","paragraphs":["(past"]},{"title":"tense) --'~')","paragraphs":[".,,- \"-~_ (introduce) .... ~C"]},{"title":"(st,bjectivecase)} <ctivecase l)~ (iobjectivecas;~","paragraphs":["Figure 3.

As modifiers satisfy bolh restrictions on the noun memfing and case-marking parlicles, they ,are bound to N2 (objective case 1) mid N3 (objective case 2), respectively. The ~malysis then lfies to bind lhe modifier with adverbial particle \"wa\" to a non-bound valency element. So far, N2 and N3 in the wflcncy paltem have already been bound. Therefore, as shown in figure 3, the only non-bound valency element is N1 which is a subjective case. The adverbial particle \"wa\" c~m stand-in for case-marking p~wticlc \"ga\", which is the non-bound wfiency clcment, mid the noun \"km-e (he)\" satisfies the scmantic restriction on the subjcctive case N1 i.e. [(agent)]. Therefore, file modifier with \"wa\" is bonnd to tim subjective case N1. Finally, lhc valency structure as shown in figure 3 is obtained.","4 Processing the Japanese double-subject construction Many Japmmse adjective predicates domhmtc two subjective cases and so form the double-subject construction. The double-subject constmctiou having an Miective predicate actually has several wlrimlts, so no one approach c,'m be uscd to mlalyze it. Accordingly, this section classifies the four types mid the characteristics of eadl type ~'e described.","4.1 Classification of the Japanese dnuble-subjcet construction Tile Japanese doublc-subjcct consmlction (also calicO the \"wa\"-\"ga\" conslruction) can be classified into lhe following four types based on a previous study (lshigami, 1977): • type-I In this vafi~mt, adverbial particle \"wa\" is a proxy for a case-marking particle such as \"ni\" other than subjective case-ram-king \"ga\". Example-1 shows \"wa\" as a proxy for case-marking particle \"hi\" in tile sentence \"wamshi no ie wa gakkou ga chikai (file school is near my house)\". Example- 1","(myhouse) (adverbial (school) (case-marking (nea 0 pro'title \"wa\") particle \"ga\")","~1¢ \"wa\" is [br \"ni\". proxy"]},{"title":"(myhousc) (destination (school) (subjective (hem') case-marking","paragraphs":["case-marking"]},{"title":"particle \"ni\")","paragraphs":["pmticle \"ga\") • type-2 in this wu'iant, adverbial parlicle \"wa\" is a proxy for case-umrking panicle \"no\" representing a noun modifier (pre-nominal). Example-2 shows \"wa\" as a proxy for pre-nominal case-marking p~ulicle \"no\" in the sentence \"zou wa ham ga nagai (elcplumls have long trunks)\". In this wu-itmI, the case of\"wa\" modifying a predicate must be analyzed as \"no\" modifying the 867 Japanese input sentence: 7~7~h~~: t, ~o (elephants have long trunks) Japanese valency pattern for \"~ 1~ v, dependency structure ~ (subjective) JR: 7~"]},{"title":"/F","paragraphs":["@@~ Ni: Label ~br a valency element refer to valency pattern SR: Semantic restriction on a noun on case-marking pazticles .' men\" ana y~ i: sentence analysis as ordinary construction as double-subject construction"]},{"title":"r.,,,v encyst ct..e va,enc st.,c,,.'o '(presen----, tense)--\"/","paragraphs":["Figure 4.

Therefore, this analysis involves re-formation of the valency structure.","Examlfle-2","(elephant) (adverbial 0rose) (case-marking (long) particle \"wa\") particle \"ga\")","~¢ \"wa\" is proxy for \"no\".","(elephant) (pre-nominal (nose) (subjective (long) case-marking case-marking particle \"no\") particle \"ga\") • type-3 In this variant, the case with case-marking particle \"ga\" sometimes represents ~m objective case. Allhough an objective case is usually marked by case-marking particle \"wo\", some adjective predicates have an oNective case marked by case-marking particle \"ga\". Example-3 shows that \"kanojo (she)\" with \"ga\" is an objective case and \"kare (he)\" with \"wa\" is a subjective case in the sentence \"kare wa kanojo ga snkida (he likes her)\". As case-marking particle \"ga\" normally indicates the subjective case, binding \"ga\" to the subjective case leads to incorrect mmlysis if only surface spelling is considered.","Examlfle-3","(he) (adveNial (her) (case-marking (like)","particle \"wa\") particle \"ga\")","• ,, ,, \" ,a\" re rcsenLs","• \"r~roxytor ~a.| g ,P .. Pwa\" lS ~ ~ ~V all oDjecuve case ~ (subjective (her) (objective (like) (he) case-marking case-marking","particle \"ga\") particle \"wo\") • type-4 In this variant, the case with adverbial particle \"wa\" acts as all adverbial phrase representing time and is actually a special form of type-1. Representing time is optional for most predicates. Moreover, Japm~ese time expressions are often translated into English adverbial phi'ases. Therefore, type-4 is separated from type-1 in this classification from viewpoint of enghmering. Example-4 shows that time expression \"6-gatsu wa (in Jmle)\" acts as an adverbial phrase in the sentence \"6-gatsu wa ame ga tot (it has much rain in June)\". Example-4","(June) (adverbial (rain) (case-marking (ninth) ~(t particle \"wa\") particlc \"ga\") ime expression with \"wa\" acts as an adverbial phrase (June) (rain) (subjective (much) (adverbial case-marking phrase) particle \"ga\")","4.2 Problems in processing the Japanese double-subject construction Type-I and type-4 cases can be analyzed using the processing flow described in section 3 because adverbial particle \"wa\" simply acts as a case-marking particle. However, the following problems ,arise when processing type-2 and type-3 cases in the normal way. • Problem with type-2 cases Fignre 4 shows the m~alysis of the type-2 example, \"zou wa hana ga nagai (elephanls have long thinks)\". The predicate \"nagai (long)\" has only one valency element N1 with \"ga\". According to ordinary sentence analysis, the modifier \"hana ga\" is bound to the valency element NI, which means that the other modifier \"zou wa\" is left unbound. That is, sentence analysis camlot be completed as shown in the left bottom of figure 4. This complicates the accurate Wanslation of this modifier into English."]},{"title":"868 Japanese input sentence:","paragraphs":["~:1:~/&'~O~ ~'57o (he likes her)","1¢ morphological Japanese wdency pattern lbr \"~(.(\" ~ 7'~('\" analysis ~ln(t dependency analysis","dcpcndcllcy structure T","N1 ISR: [(human)], [(animal)]","//~--;~-~'~ ~Q"]},{"title":"~-]~\"~ f:/)f @","paragraphs":["]5'(present tense) ~ .fly,} (suhjective) ]I/JR: 75{ k...

This leads us lo lhe wrong interpretation as shown in lhe left bottom of figure 5.","5 Proposed method for analyzing Japanese double-subject construction In order to overcome lhe problems described in the previous section, this section proposes a method for analyzing a Japanese double-subject conslmction having m~ adjective predicate.

Processing flow for analyzing a Japanese douMe-suhjeet construction. well as sentences with verb predicates, are processed normally as described ill section 3. • Type determination First, lype-4 is set if the modifier with adverbial parlicle \"wa\" represents a time expression or not. Tiffs is efficient because type-4 is the most specific type. This judgment is performed by checking whether the semantic calegory of the noun included in the modifier with \"wa\" is associated with [(time)] or not. Second, type-3 is set by the valency paltem for the predicate in lh¢ input. The predicate in a type-3 case has to cover 869 both subjective and objective cases in its usage. The valency pattern for each usage for each predicate is defined in the valency pattern dictionary. Therefore, this judgment is performed by checking whether the valency pattern for the predicate includes both a subjcctive case and an objective case. Finally, type-1 and type-2 are differentiated according to the result of binding betwccn the modifiers in the input senteuce and thevalency elements inthe valency pattern. Type-2 is set ff the modifier with case-marking particle \"ga\" is bound to the subjective case and the modifier with adverbi~d particle \"wa\" is not. The remaining cases are judged as type-1. Here, modifiers with \"wa\" and \"ga\" ,are often bound in type-1. Notice that the binding process resolves what case-marking parlicle the adverbial particle \"wa\" stands-in for. • Determining the valency structure In the type-4 preprocessing step in figure 6, the modifier with \"wa\" (time reference) is considered as an adverbial plwase. Next, binding the other modifiers with the valency elements in the valency pattern for the prcdicate is attcmpted. This facilitates the translation of Japanese time expressions into English.","In the type-3 prcprocessing step in figure 6, case-marking particle \"ga\" has to be converted into the case-marking particle \"wo\" before binding the former which represents an objective case. This conversion allows us to correctly bind each modifier to its appropriate valency element, becanse predicates in type-3 cases have both a subjective case with \"ga\" and an objective case with \"wo\". See the example in the right bottom of fignre 5.","In type-2 processing, adverbial particle \"wa\" is a proxy for pre-nominal case-marking particle \"no\" and the modifier with adverbial particle \"wa\" must be analyzed as the phrase which modifies the snbjective case with \"ga\". As a result, type-2 mmlysis involves changing the valency structure. In figure 4, the noun phrase \"zou no hana\" is fornled from both \"zou (elcphant)\" with \"wa\" and \"hzma 0lose)\" with \"ga\" by converting \"wa\" into \"no\", and \"zou no hana\" is bound to the subjective case for the predicate \"nagai (long)\". See the example in the right bottom of figure 4. Moreover, type-2 processing tries to determine the semantic relation between the noun with \"ga\" and the noun with \"no\" (originally \"wa\"). Determining the semmltic relation helps us translate the Japanese double-subject construction into the appropriate English construction and expression. Although several semantic relations are known, at the present time ALT-J/E can resolve only two of them based on semantic categories: has-a relation and is-a relation.","As adverbial particle \"wa\" in type-I cases is a proxy for a case-marking particle such as \"ni\", \"de\" and so on, type-I cases can be processed in the way described in section 3.","The above approach con'ectly determines die input sentence's valency structure which allows the maddne translation system to produce more accurate output. As a result, the method proposed here improves the translation accuracy of ALT-J/E. 6 Conclusion This paper has proposed a method for analyzing the Japanese double-subject construction that includes an adjective predicate. This paper has classified the construction into four .types and described problems when applying the ordinary sentence analysis to the four types. The algorithm that overcomes these problems has been explained in detail.","This method has been applied to Japanese sentence analysis in ALT-J/E.
