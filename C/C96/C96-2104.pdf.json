QJP analyzes a Japanese sentence into segmented morphemes/words with tags and a syntactic bunsetsu kakari-uke structure based on the two strategies, a) Morphological analysis based on character-types and functional-words and b) Syntactic analysis by simple treatment of structural ambiguities and ignoring semantic information. QJP is small, fast and robust, because 1) dictionary size (less than1 100KB) and required memory size(260KB) are very small, 2) analysis speed is fast (more than 100 words/see on 80486-PC), and 3) even a 100-word long sentence containing unknown words is easily processed.","Using QJP and its ana]ysis results as a base and adding other functions for processing Japanese documents, a valqety of applications can be developed on UNIX workstations or even on PCs."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language parser/analyser is essential for allowing advanced functions in document processing systems, such as keyword extraction to characterize a text, key-sentence extraction to abstract a document, grammatiea] style checker, information or knowledge retrieval, natura] lmlguage understanding, naturai language interface and so on. But a general purpose parser requires 1) a laxge dictionary database with more than several tens of thousands words, 2) advanced techniques for disambiguation and processing semantics, aald 3) substantial machine resources, such as a lot of memory and high speed CPU.","In addition, users must mMntain additional terms in dictionaxies for specialized fields. As a result, most parsers cannot be easily used in applications and it is difficult to develop a practical parser which can be easily integrated into many applications.","We changed our viewpoint in order to design and develop aal applicable and usable Japanese parser. First, we focused on the unique sets of character-types in written Japanese and constructed a very small dictionary using mainly functional words in hiragana-chm'acter. Similar approaches[i][2] were used for segmentation or preliminary morphological analysis about 20 years ago, using the transitionpoint between types of ehaxaeter sets to cue word segmentation. Second, we noticed that dealing with syntactic ambiguities creates a large processing burden and even using semantic information does little to assist syntactic analysis at the current level. So we either simplified dealing of structural ambiguities or ignored semantics to lighten the syntactic processing.","We first created a prototype of our parser[3] using AWK language, and then rewrote it [4] in C so it could be included in applications. The resulting parser, named QJP, is portable, fast and robust. It is an effective parser for many general purpose applications, despite of a dictionalT size of only 5 thousand words. It can analyze a 100-word sentence on a PC in less than one second, while using less than half of a megabyte of memory. In addition, it requires no further dictionaxT maintenance for new terms .","In this paper we describe the QJP's analysis methods and report on its current performances."]},{"title":"2 Analysis Method","paragraphs":["QJP performs two types of analysis : 1) morphological analysis to segment a sentence into part-of-speech tagged morphemes and words, 2) syntactic analysis to place words into bunsetsuLdependency structure.

But not oldy the size of files lint also the 1)erfornlallce figures for memory and speed of QJP are thought to be mot'(,, than ten times better than those of existing Japanese analysers[4]. As for analysis accuracy, the morphologicM accnracy is a little lower than that of the existing Jai)anese morphological aualysers usil,g large s(Me dictionaries, but the syntactic analysis accuracy is thought to be no worse than that of the existing Jalmnese syntactic analysers."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have designed and implemented QJP h~r the purpose of readily and e,~sily applicable morlflmlogical and syntactic amdyser for Japanese. The design strategies are based on 1) the morphological analysis bLsed on character-types and fimctional words to reduce the size of diet&mary, and 2) the syntactic am'dysis by simple treatment of structural ambiguities and ignoring semantic information to lighten processing.","QJP, ~s implelnented, is portable, quick and robust. All tiles needed for execution im:luding dictionary total less than 300KB on DOS. Even on a slow PC a 100-word sentence (:an be analyzed in less than 1 second using a small amount of memory. This performances is thought to be quite excellent. The almlysis accuracy is comparable to that of other existing analysers. No dictionary maintenance is necessary for new ternls.","The fnnctions of QJP are inq)lemented ~Ls a QJP lil)rary an(l a QJP workbench. We lmve alremly utilized QJP flw keyword extraction, natnrM language query and text reading supt)ort fltnctioas[9] and are t)lamfing fllrther applications, such ms infi)rlnati(m retrieval system. Others use QJP fimctions for other purposes, such as linguistic data extraction.","QJP currently doesn't segment compound kanji words of Chinese-origin and leaves this segmentation to the application. In the fltture, we plan to realize such at segmenting fimction using on statistical data[10] a,,d aIlixes[2]."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Yoshiyuki SAKAMOTO: An Automatic Segmentation for Japanese Text, M~tthematical Linguistics, Vol.ll, No.6, 1978 (ill Japmlcse).","[2] Makoto NAGAO, Jun-ichi TSUJII, Akira YAM-AGAMI, Shuji TATEBE: Data-Structure of a Large Japanese Dictionary and Morphological Analysis by Using It, Journal of hfformation Processing Society of JaI)au , Vol.19 No.0, pp.514-521, 1978 (ill .Japanese).","[3] Masayuki KAMEDA: A Quick aat)anesc Parser, Information Pro~iessing Society of Japan SIG Note~, 94-NL-4, 1993 (in aapmmse).","[4] Masayuki KAMEDA: A Portable & Quick Japanese Processing Tool : QJP, I'roc. of the 1st Annual Meeting of the Association for Natural Language Processing, 1995 (in Jai)anese ).","[5] Masayuki KAMEDA, Shin ISIIII, tIideo ITO: Interactive Disaml)iguation ill a JaI)anese Analysis System, Information Processing Society of Japan SIG Notes, 84-NL-2, 1991 (in Japanese). aeSO 7~ J L~:'~ ~ ©~)J~mt]l'l>~, EDR 7tJ: f-iga%~*lJ)l] ~/7],~9¢d & i,~.9.::JJ~, 1995 (in Jai)ancsc ).","[7] Sadao KUROHASHI, Makoto NAGAO: A Method for Analyzing Conjmmtive Structures in Japanese, q¥ansactions of Infornuttion Processing Society of Japan, Vol.33 No.8, I)p.1022-1031, 1992 (in Jal)anese ).","[8] Sadao KUROHASIII, Toshihisa NAKAMURA, Yuji MATSUMOTO and Makoto NAGAO : hnprovement of Japanese Morl)hologic~d Analyser JUMAN, Proc, of the International Workshop on Sharablc Natural Language Resources, pp.22-28, 1994.","[9] Masayuki KAMEDA: Supl)ort fimctions for Read-ing Japanese text, hfformation Processing Society of Japan SIG Notes, ll0-NL-9, 1995 (in Japanese).","[10] Koichi TAKEDA, Tetsunosuke FUJISAKI: Automarie Decomposition of Kanji Compound Words Using Stochastic Estimation, Transactions of Infof marion Processing Society of Japan, Vol.28 No.9, pp.952-961, 1987 (ill Japanese).
