Although formalisms such as Intensional Logic, DR?l', and Situation Semantics look different on first sight, they share many common assumptions, and provide similar treatmeats of many phenomena. The CLEARS tool allows exploration and comparison of these different formalisms, enabling the user to get an idea of the range of possibilities of semantic construction. It is intended to be used as both a research tool and a tutoriM tool.","The first part of the paper shows the potential of the system for investigating the properties of different seinantic formMisms, and for teaching students formal semantics. The next section outlines the library contents and the system architecture, which was designed to reflect convergence between theories.

Most of the library contents correspond directly to particular values of parameter settings. However there are some extra library routines, for example a very generalised form of flmction composition. The library is being expanded with routines for semantic construction driven by semantic types. It is also intended to integrate a wider range of grammars, parsing strategies and pronoun resolution strategies. For program documentation we largely have followed the approach taken in LEDA (Ngher, 1993)).","Apart from the routines concerned directly with computational semantics, there are also routines designed to aid application developers who want to provide a graphical output tbr semantic representations.

For this application, such an approach had obvious in-adequacies. For example, there are subtle differences in some steps of quantifier storage according to the formalism being used, similarly, differences even in lambda reduction (for intensional logic it is natural to interleave the step of operator can-eellation between/?-reductions). Even the parsing stage cannot be totally independent unless we generalise to the worst case (the Situation Semantics fragment requires an utterance node as well as a sentence node).","One of the aims in building the tool was to show where semantic formalisms converge. Thus there was theoretical motivation to ensure components of the system were shared wherever possible. There was also practical motivation, since there is more chance of finding errors in shared code.

There are some small costs due to indirection (instead of calling e.g. a /?-reducer directly, a program first calls a routine which chooses the /?-reducer according to the parameters). But with these parameterisation layers we provide natural points where the system can be extended or modified by the user. The approach also gets rid of the need to create large data structures which include information which would be relevant for one choice of parameters, but not the current choice. For example, in parsing, a parameterised level chooses how to annotate nodes so that the syntax trees only have the relevant inibrmation for the chosen syntax-semantics strategy. The architecture is illustrated in Figure 5.","The result of the parameterised approach is a system which provides several thousand possible valid combinations of semantic tbrmalism, grammar, reducer etc. using a small amount of code."]},{"title":"5 The Graphical Interface","paragraphs":["A major part of our work on the educational tool was the development of a general graphical browser or"]},{"title":"grapher","paragraphs":["for the graphical notations used in computational linguistics, especiMly those in computational semantics such as trees, Attribute-Value-Matrices, EKN (Barwise and Cooper, 1993) and 1)RSs.
