One of the major problems with bilingual dictionaries is that they are expensive to build, since a huge number of terms are used in a variety of fields. Cnmputer support is thus needed to reduce the cost of dictionary building.","With the growing wdume of text available in electronic lorm, a number of methods have been proposed tor extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora automatically. These methods can be divided into those taking a statistical approach (Gale & Church 1991a; Kupiec 1993; Dagan et al. 1993; Inoue & Nogaito 1993; Fung 1995) and those taking a linguistic approach (Yamamoto & Sakamoto 1993; Kum~mo & Hirakawa 1994; Ishimoto & Nagao 1994). The statistical approach utilizes the occurrence frequencies and locations of words in a parallel corpus to calculate the pairwise correlations between the words in the two languages. The linguistic approach primarily extracts correspondences between compound words by consulting a bilingual dictionary of simple words.","These proposed methods for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora have the following drawbacks. First, most of theln assume that the input corpora m'e aligned sentence by sentence, which reduces their applicability remarkably. Although a number of automatic sentence alignment methods have been proposed (Brown et al. 1991 ; Gale & Church 1991 b; Kay & Roscheisen 1993; Chen 1993), they are not very reliable for real noisy bilingual texts. Second, the statistical methods usually require a very large corpus as their input. However, it is not easy to obtain a very large corpus. Third, tile linguistic methods are restricted to extracting correspondences between compound words.","We have developed an extraction method that is free fi'om the above drawbacks. In Sec. 2 we describe the hasic idea of our methud and give an overview. In Sec. 3 we describe the technical details, and in Sec. 4 we describe an experiment using patent-specification texts. In Sec. 5 we make a remark on the effectiveness of the proposed method, and discuss directions for improvement. 2 Overview of Proposed Method The finding underlying our proposed method is as follows. In a hilingual corpus, a pair of words corresponding to each other generally accompany the same context, although expressed in the two diflcrent languages. If we calculate the pairwise correlations between the contexts in which the words occur, a correponding pair of words will show a high correlation. Although one occurrence of a word may not give a suMcient context to chm'acterize the word, accumulating all the contexts in which the word occurs throughout the text allows the word to be distinguished from the other words in the same language text.","Figure 1 shows how two words are associated through their contexts, each expressed in its respective language. We use the set of words co-nccurring with word w, which we refer to as the co-occurrence set of w, to concisely represent tire accumtdated contexts characterizing the word. To associate two co-occurrence sets whose elements are words in different languages, we consult a bilingual dictionary and extract the possible word correspondences between them. The point is that even if the pair of words to be associated is missing in the bilingual dictionary, their co-occurrence sets can be associated through the bilingual dictionary. Of cource, some of the correspondences between the co-occurrence sets may be also missing in the bilingual dictionary. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence sets can be still associated, owing to the other correspondences between them that arc contained in the bilingual dictionary.","• Our proposed method (Fig. 2) is based on the above"]},{"title":"23 Japanese text","paragraphs":["......

While the examples shown here are for Japanese and English, the method is applicable to any pair of languages. The method is divided into three parts: Japanese text processing, English text processing, and bilingual processing. The Japanese text processing is composed of sentence segmentation, morphological analysis, and co-occurrence data extraction. It extracts a co-occurrence set for each word from a Japanese text. Likewise, the English text processing extracts a co-occurrence set for each word from an Engish text. The bilingual processing then calculates the pairwise correlations between the co-occurrence sets for Japanese words and those for English words, and selects the pairs of words with the highest correlations. 3 Technical Details 3.1 Extraction of words from text Natural language texts are composed of two types of words: content words and function words. The target of extraction can usually be restricted to the correspondences between content words, which are characterized by both dominance in number and straightforwardness. Additionally, the function words are useless as elements of co-occurrence sets, since they do not indicate specific contexts. Therefore, we extract only the content words from the texts in both languages.","The content words are divided into simple words and 24 compound words. The tbnner are extracted by dictionary look up mid morphological analysis. To extract the latter, we are describing a set of rules or patterns. So far, we have only addressed nominal compounds (simple noun phrases), whose patterns arc given below. Here, N, A, and NP stand for noun, adjective, and simple noun phrase, respectively. Nq- stands for at string of one or more Ns.","• Japanese nominal comlxmnds: NP := N N+","• English nonfinal compounds: NP := N N+ I A N+","The nominal compounds are extracted from the morphological analysis results by pattern matching. Here, an NP included in a larger NP is rejected, since only self-contained NPs qualify as nominal compounds. One exception is an English NP starting wilh a noun that is included in an NP starting with an adjective, lmcause the case of an adjective modil'ying a nominal compound is just as likely as the case of an adjective being a part of a no Illinltl C O m pc ulld, 3.2 Extraction of co-occurrence data Definitions of 'co-occurrence' include syntactic co-occurrence, co-occurrence in a k-word window, co-.occurrcuce ill a sentence, and co-occnrfcncc ill a documen|. We use co-.occurrence i n a sentence, i n which a pair of words occurring within the same sentence is regarded as a co-occurrence. While co-occurrence in a k-word window may produce better results when a sentence in one hulguage corresi)onds to a sequence of lwo or more shorler sentences in tile other language, it is difficult to determine an appropriate wdue of k because word order differs considerably between Japanese and English.","The relations between a compound word and its constituent words are not, strictly speaking, co-occnrreuce relations. Moreover, if we treated them in the same nlanucr its co-occurrence relations, it would cause some confosion. Suppose that compound word w is composed of lwo simple words, w' and w\". If we included both w' and w\" in the co-occurrence set of w, and vice versa, the differences between the co-occurrence set of w and those of w' and w\" woukl decrease. Therefore, we exclude the constituent words from the co-occurrence set of a compound word and vice versa.","As mentioned in Section 2, the co-occurrence sets of a word are accumulated. This is not a mere union operation, but a union operation accompanied by frequency counting. The resultant co-occurrence set i s expressed as","C(w)= {w,/f, [ i = 1 ,-'-, n }, which shows that word w~co-occurs with word w ( times.","3.3 Calculation of correlations between words We define correlation"]},{"title":"R(jw, ew)","paragraphs":["between Japanese word jw and English word"]},{"title":"ew","paragraphs":["as follows."]},{"title":"R(jw, ew)","paragraphs":[":"]},{"title":"I c(jw)","paragraphs":["Cl"]},{"title":"C(ew)","paragraphs":["I"]},{"title":"/ { I C(iw) I t- I C(ew) I I C(/w) r) C(ew) I 1.","paragraphs":["Here, C(jw) ="]},{"title":"{jw,/t~","paragraphs":["I i= 1 ,'\", m} and C(ew) = {e%/gj I j= 1,'\", n} are the co-occurrence sets of"]},{"title":"jw and ew,","paragraphs":["respectively.

Figure 3(a) shows that the number of elements in the intersection exceeds that in the Japanese co-uccurrence set. The English-based and Japanese-based approximate calculations therefore do not always coincide with each other. While selecting the minimmn of the two approxinmte wducs is safer, it does not guarantee a precise value. Since ambiguity in associating co-occurrence sets does not occur too often, and considering the need lbr efficiency, we execute either of the two approximate calculations rather than make a precise calculation.","To increase tile reliability of the correlation values, we remove tile useless words from tile Co-occurrence sets before calculating the correlations.

The coverage is the proportion of the word correspondences in the corpus that are already contained in the bilingual dictionary. Generally speaking, the wider the coverage, the more reliable the correlation values. Accordingly, the feedback of extracted pairs will probably improve performance, even though some of them are erroneous. In Fig. 2, the feedback is represented by dotted line."]},{"title":"4 Experiment","paragraphs":["and Results We implemented our proposed method on a workstation and carried out an experiment using patent-specification documents in Japanese and English and a bilingual dictionary for a machine translation system. The dictionary contains approximately 60,000 Japanese entry words, each having several English translations. The quantitative profile of the sample patent documents is shown in Table l(a).","We executed the word correspondence extraction program for each document. Parameter a in the selection of pairs of words was assumed to be 0. This means that tile output pairs were limited as much as possible. Both results before and after feedback were obtained to evaluate the effect of feedback. The extracted pairs of words were divided into two groups: those which are already contained in the bilingual dictionary and those which are not yet contained in the bilingual dictionaryJ ) The former are insignificant from the practical point of view. However, they are signficant in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed correlation measure because the dictionary information regarding a particular pair of words does not contribute to the correlation between the pak itself. Accordingly, we evaluated two cases: Case A - the already known pairs of words are included - and Case B - the already known pairs of words are excluded.","A good way to evaluate word correspondence extraction methods is to measure their recall and precision.

The precision is the proportion of extracted word correspondences that arc actually correct. While the precision is rather easy to calculate, the recall is difficult to calculate because it is a time-consuming task to manually identify all the word correspondences in the bilingual cortms. Therefore, instead of calculating the recall according to its de_nition, we make a rough estimation using the ratio of the number of correct pairs of words extracted to the number of words in either the Japanese or English text. We call this the pseudo-recall. The pseudo-recall indicates the lowest limit of the recall since a word in the Japanese text does not always have a straightforward counterpart in the English text, and vice versa.","Tables l(b) and (c) show the pseudo-recall and the precision in Cases A and B, respectively, lu Case A, the pseudo-recall and precision before feedback were 27.8%"]},{"title":"Table 2 Examples of extracted word correspondences.","paragraphs":["Example ( S, S ) ( ~Jl!-~, pumping ) ( ij I ~ ~,)~ ~, subsequently ) ( S, C ) ( i~lhi, liquid level ) ( ~-, thin fihn ) ( C, S ) ( ~f,4~ ~,i~, vaporizer ) ( ~)~f~ l l, connector )"]},{"title":"( YfV, ~k,,,,~. ,--~]¢~t~.,","paragraphs":["gas supplier ) ( ~)~3/.

In Case B, the pseudo-recall and precision before feedback were 25.7% and 74.9% 27 respectively, and those after feedback were 28.0% and 75.6%.","The experiment confirmed that the proposed method can extract not only compound word correspondences but also simple word correspondences from a small corpus. Examples of word correspondences extracted from a patent document are shown in Table 2. The comparison of results before and after feedback supported the effectiveness of using feedback. That is, feedback increases recall while preserving precision. We also ascertained that repeating the feedback one more time did not result in significant improvement. 5 Discussion The experiment shows that the proposed method is effective in reducing the cost of bilingual dictionary augmentation. Tile recall of the method is not high. Furthermore, it cannot extract more than one correspondence for a word. Still, the method is effective because it can extract from a small corpus. Bilingual documenLs should be handled separately. Even if a correspondence pair of words fails to be extracted from one bilingual document, it may be extracted from another bilingual document, where it occurs prevailingly.","The following are directions for further improvement. (1) Refinement of nominal compound extraction procedure: The simplified procedure described in Sec. 3.1 often causes omission (a nominal compound is not extracted) and noise (an inappropriate word string is extracted). These are major causes of errors in word correspondence extraction; refining the nominal compound extraction procedure will considerably improve recall and precision. (2) Use of symbol/numeral correspondences: In the present implementation, the correspondences of symbols and numerals are not used in calculating the correlation because the bilingual dictionary does not contain them. However, they have the potential of increasing the reliablilty of the correlation values. A character-string-matching routine to identify the correspondences of symbols/numerals should thus be added to the correlation calculation module. (3) Use of the constituent word information of compound words: The key idea of our method is to associate a pair of words through their co-occurrence information with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary. In contrast, that of the previous linguistic methods is to associate a pair of compound words through their constituent word information with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary. These two are not incompatible. Combining them would surely increase the recall and precision for compound word correspondences. 6 Conclusion","We have developed a new method for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora. The essence of the method is to calculate correlations between words based on their co-occurrence information with the assistance of a basic word bilingual dictionary. This method is applicable to rather small, unaligned corpora; it can extract correspondences between not only simple words but also between compound words. In an experiment with patent corpora, 28.0% pseudo-recall and 75.6% precision were achieved.
