'1?he structural dissimilarity between Korean and Indo-European languages requires more flexible measures to evaluate the alignment candidates between the bilingual units than is used to handle the pairs of Indo-European languages. The flexible measure is intended to capture the dependency between bilingual items that can occur in different units according to different ordering rules. The proposed method to accomplish Korean-English aligmnent takes phrases as an alignment unit that is a departure from the existing methods taking words as the unit. Phrasal alignment avoids the problem of alignment units and appease the problem of ordering mismatch. The parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. The proposed alignment algorithm is based on dynamic programming. In the experimenl, s carried out on 253,000 English words and its Korean translations the proposed method achived 68.7% in accuracy at phrase level and 89.2% in accuracy with the bilingual dictionary induced from the alignment. 'File result of the alignment may lead to richer bilingual data than can be derived from only word-level aligments."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Studies on parallel corpus consisting of multilin-gum texts are often guided with the purpose to obtain linguistic resources such as bilingual dictionary, bilingual grammars (Wu 1995) and translation examples.

As the parallel corpora become more and more accessible, many researches based on the bilingual corpora are now encouraged that were once considered impractical.","Alignment as a study of parallel corpus refers to the process of establishing the correspondences between matching elements in parallel corpus. Alignment methods tend to approach the problem differently according to the alignment units the methods adopt. Of various alignment options, the alignlnent of word units is to compute a sequence of the matching pairs of words in a parallel corpus.","Figure 1 show the aligned results of a parallel corpus that was originally paired in a sentence level.

Described in the parentheses on the right of each Korean word are corresponding English meaning and syntactic functions of the word.","The existing methods for the alignment of Indo-European language pairs such as English and French take words as aligning units and restrict the correspondences between words to be one of the functional mappings (one-to-one, one-to-230"]},{"title":"~i ,,, I ...... lig,~c(~l a SClIteIICC level . 1 l} / K/E Align,n?k ~ - 7-[ [~ : ~--[--","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Ov('a'view of the l)roposed aligmnent method."]},{"title":"many) (l~row,~ ('~t al. 199:1, Sn,ad,ia 1!)!~2).
