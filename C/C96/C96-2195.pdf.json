The features of the EDR Electronic Dictionary can be summarized as follows:","(1) A large scale that covers all the vocabulary used in ordinary writing (2) Aimed at general purpose applications without bias towards a particular application system or algorithm (3) Provided with the knowledge base required for true","semantic analysis (4) A high degree of objectivity based on large volumes of text","(5) Fundamental content that is highly generalized across different languages and fields The EDR Electronic Dictionary, which is composed of eleven sub-dictionaries, catalogues the lexical knowledge * Fujitsu, Ltd., NEC Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Sharp Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. of Japanese and English (the Word Dictionary, the Bilingual Dictionary, and the Co-occurrence Dictionary), and has unified thesaurus-like concept classifications (the Concept Dictionary) with corpus databases (the EDR Corpus). The Concept Classification Dictionary, a sub-dictionary of the Concept Dictionary, describes the similarity relation among concepts listed in the Word Dictionary. The EDR Corpus is the source for the information described in each of the sub-dictionaries. The basic approach taken during the development of the dictionary was to avoid a particular linguistic theory and to allow for adoptability to various applications. The first version of EDR dictionary (VI.0) and its revised version (V1.5) are already released and are now utilized at many sites for both academic and commercial purposes. This paper outlines the specification of EDR Electronic Dictionary and describes the current status of its utilization."]},{"title":"2 The Structure of the EDR Electronic Dictionary","paragraphs":["The EDR Electronic Dictionary is composed of five types of dictionaries (Word, Bilingual, Concept, Co-occurrence, and Technical Terminology), as well as thb EDR Corpus."]},{"title":"EDR Electronic Dictionary -Word Dictionary","paragraphs":["L Japanese Word Dictionary"]},{"title":"English Word Dictionary - B.ilingual Dictionary","paragraphs":["~-Jpn.-Eng.

The Concept Description Dictionary describes the semantic (binary) relations, such as 'agent,' 'implement,' and 'place,' between concepts that co-occur in a sentence. The Co-occurrence Dictionm'y describes collocational information in the form of binm'y relations. The Japanese CooccmTence Dictionary contains 900,000 phrases, and the English Co-occurrence Dictionary contains 460,000 phrases. The Technical Terminology Dictionary covers the field of infbrmation processing, attd is split into four types of dictionaries of Word, Bilingual, Concept (Classification), and Co-occurrence. The linguistic data which the EDR Corpus contains has been obtained by collecting a large number of example sentences and analyzing them on morphoh)gical, syntactic, attd semantic levels.

Morphological information relates to headword (morpheme) mid intbrmation on the connectivity of roof phemes. This is used in morphological analysis to find the morphemes, and also used in morphological generation to produce output sentences. Information on the syntactic level includes parts of speech as well as surface case information and other grammatical attributes. This information is used in syntactic analysis and generation, and provides the basis for the formulation of parsing rules and production rules. Semantic information includes concept identifiers. Headconcept and concept explications are provided as accampanying information. The concept identifier is a numerical expression and the basic constituent of the Concept Dictionary. The headconcept is a representative word that is the most appropriate in expressing the corn cept identified by the concept identifier. The concept explication is an explanation written in natural language tor the p.,i,o,~;c of assisting humans in differentiating one ~:,~nccpl Imm another. Every Word Dictionary record has a concci)t identifier to link the Word Dictionary and the","Concept Dictionary.

The eoricept identifiers and concept explications are used to indentify the meaning of the polysemous headwords. Some of the correspondence words include additional information which describes the constraints where the correspondence words are u~d. The following is an example of English Japanese Biligual Dictionary record:","paragraphs":["Headword : dog Part of Speech: ENI (common noun) Concept_ID : 3dbc67 Headconcept : dog Concept Explication: an animal called dog Correspondence Word:"]},{"title":"3.3 Concept Dictionary The role of the Concept Dictionary is to provide the data required for computer processing of the semantic contents or the concepts, expressed in natural language sentences, such as: (1) Generating appropriate semantic representations for sentences (2) Determining the similarity (equivalence) of seman- tic contents (3) Converting a semantic content into a similar (equivalent) content For this reason, the Concept Dictionary contains three types of subdictionaries: Headconcept Dictionary, Concept Classification Dictionary, and Concept Description Dictionary. In the Concept Dictionary, each concept is uniquely identified by a concept identifier which is a hexadecimal number. The Headconcept Dictionary contains the concept identifier and the headconcept, and the concept explication. The headconcept is a word whose meaning is close to the content meaning of the concept. The concept explication is an explanation which expresses the meaning of the concept. The Concept Classification Dictionary contains the set of pairs of concepts that have super-sub (is_a) relation. For example, the super-concepts of 'school' are 'organization,' 'building,' and 'function.' The sub-concepts of 'school' are 'elementary school,' 'university,' and so forth. The Concept Description Dictionary contains the set of pairs of concepts that have certain semantic relations other than super-sub relations.

The basic role of the EDR Corpus is first to identify the sentence constituents of sentences, and then to indicate how the constituents combine to form the morphological, syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence using a large number of actual examples. The data in the Concept Description Dictionary and the Co-occurrence Dictionary is extracted from the EDR Corpus. These subdictionaries are not indendent, but are organically connected (Figure 1)."]},{"title":"4 The Current Status of Utilization","paragraphs":["As we mentioned in chapter 1, we have already released the first CD-ROM version of EDR Electronic dictionary (V1.0) in April 1995 after the nine year R&D project. They are now being utilized at many sites for both academic and commercial purposes (Table 1). In fiscal 1995, furthermore refinement and improvement were done and the revised version (V1.5) is available since April 1996. One of the users, Fujitsu, released a commercial product using the EDR Electronic Dictionary in 1995. The product is called \"Denjikai for Windows V2.0,\" which retrieves the word information from various dictionaries including EDR Electronic Dictionary."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["A number of dictionaries are currentry being developed under the name of electronic dictionaries (machine-readable dictionaries). These dictionaries consist of information li'om published dictionaries that has been stored on a recording medium, and which can then be referred to and used by mechanical means. However, these electronic dictionaries are referred to and used by people, unlike true electronic dictionaries (machine-tractable dictionaries), which in the strict sense are intended for use in machine processing. True electronic dictionaries are not simply machine-readable editions of dictionries for use by people. They must include all the information necessary for a computer to understand a natural language. We think that the EDR Electronic Dictionary satisfies those conditions and hope that it will be widely used for various natural language processing applications. Finally we would like to make a short remark on the new project which EDR will launch in fiscal 1996. The new project will be funded by Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) of Japan and will be carried out in conjunction with Tokyo Institute of Technology and Tokyo University. The objective of the project will be the creation of a software that will allow the linguistic knowledge base to automatically expand by feeding the output of analyzed text into the knowledge base itself. We hope this will help refine and extend the EDR Electronic Dictionary.
