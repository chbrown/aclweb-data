To allow cooperation and resolution of conflicts, we have developed interaction protocols adapted to the needs of a natural language processing system for written french. These interaction protocols allow cooperation and resolution of conflicts that appear at one time in the system, particularly during complex linguistic phenomena treatment.","Currently, we are integrating the prototype linguistic agents (which implement different types of coordination, negation and ellipsis) in order to validate the developed protocols. The implementa-tion is realized with Prolog II+ on an IBM Workstation. After the implementation, we will be able to evaluate and possibly refine the cooperation and conflicts resolution methods that have been developed."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Benoit P., Rincel P., Sabatier P., Vienne D.
