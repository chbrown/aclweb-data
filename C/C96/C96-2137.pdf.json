This method focuses on semantic and pragmatic constraints such as semantic constraints on cases, modal expressions, verbal semantic attributes and conjunctions to determine the deictic reference of Japanese zero pronouns. This method is highly effective because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand is not very large and its precision of resolution is good. This method was implemented in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system, ALT-J/E. According to a window test for 175 zero pronouns with deictic referent in a sentence set for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, all of zero pronouns could be resolved consistently and correctly. 1 Introduction In all natural language, elements that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978). This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural language processing systems. For example in a machine translation system, the system needs to recognize that elements which are not present in the source language, may become mandatory elements in the target language. In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese; whereas they are often mandatory in English."]},{"title":"Thus,","paragraphs":["in Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (these are referred to as \"zero pronouns\") for their translation into English expressions.","Several methods have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986) (Walker et al., 1990) (Yoshimoto, 1988) (Dousaka, 1994). When considering the application of these methods to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area can not be limited, it is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resolution is low as they only use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared betbrehand is so large.","The zero pronouns that must be resolved by a machine translation system carl be classitied into 3 types; (a) zero pronouns with antecedents within the same sentence (intrasenteutial), (b) zero pronouns with antecedents elsewhere in the text (intersentential) and (c) zero pronouns with deictic reference (extrasentential). Regarding type (b), Nakaiwa and Ikehara (1992) proposed a method to determine the intersentential antecedents us-- ing verbal semantic attributes. The rules used in this method are independent of the field of the source text. Therefore, anaphora resolution may be conducted with a relatively small volume of knowledge, making the proposed method very suitable for machine translation systems. Furthermore, for type (a), Nakaiwa and [kehara(1995) proposed a method to determine the intrasententim antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns using semantic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes and pragmatic constraints such as types of conjunctions and modal expressions.","In this paper, we propose a widely applicable method to determine the deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns (type (c)) using not only semantic constraints to the c~es but also fln:ther semantic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes and pragmatic constraints such as modal expressions and types of conjunctions. 2 Appearance of Zero Pronouns in"]},{"title":"Japanese Texts","paragraphs":["In order to understand the distribution of zero pronouns with antecedents that do not appeal\" in the text, in this section, we examine which zero pronouns nmst be resolved and where their antecedents appear, using a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English ma-"]},{"title":"812","paragraphs":["chine translation systems (lkehara et al., 1994).

In this section, we examine three kinds of semantic and pragmatic constraints, modal expressions, verbal semantic attributes arid conjunctions. 3.2.1 Constraints Based on Modal","Expressions","Modal expressions in Japanese are expected Co be the most powerful constraints for estimating deictie reference. For example, in the case of zero prononns in ga-cases 'subject', the referent becomes the writer or speaker, I or a group, we if the sentence has the modal expressions, -sitai '4) want to -' HOPF, or -silchosii '¢ want ¢ to-' CAUSATIVE HOI'E; the referent becomes the reader or hearer, you if the sentence has the modal expressions, - sileha-ikenai '4) must not -' PR()IIIBIT or -subekida '¢ should -' OBLmA'rmN. If there are no refereat candidates found within the surrounding text, the referents can be determined using the previous constraints based on modal expressions. 3.2.2 Constraints based on Verbal","Smnantie Attributes","Constraints b~sed on verbal semantic attributes can be divided into tile [bllowing two types: (1) Constraints based on the types of verbs 'Give and take' expressions such as the verbs moran 'get' and yaru 'give' and transfer expressions such as the verbs iku 'go' and h'ur'u 'come' can deternfine the referents of zero pronouns without modal expressions. For example, if the ga-case (subject) of the sentence whose verb is ,nora'tt 'get' becolnes a zero pronoun, the referent becomes 1. In the case of verb kuru 'come', the referent becomes an element other than i, tbr example you. These kinds of verbs inrplicitly indicate tile relationship between the writer/speaker and the referent of the ga-case (for example, the empathy (Kuno, 1978) or the side of the territory of in-fbrmation (Kmnio, 1985)). Based on these properties, tire deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns (:an be estimated. (2) Constraints based on the types of verbs and modal expressious I,;ven if the referents of zero pronouns (:an not be determined using modal expressions or tile types of verbs, the referents can sometimes be determined using a combination of modal expressions and the types of verbs. For example, it1 the following Japanese expression, the ga-case becomes a zero pronoun. (1) hon-wo gon-da","¢-SUBJ book-OI3J ]read-PAST","I read a book. In this sentence the experience of the writer/speaker, 1 is suitable for the reference of the zero pronoun. As shown in this sentence, if the ga-c~use in an expression with a verb whose semantic attribute is ACTION and modal expre.s-sion is -ta PAST, becomes a zero pronoun, it will be translated by a truman translator ~s 1. In a similar way, if the ga-case in an expression with a verb whose semantic attribute is ACT1ON and modal expression is -darou 'will' FSTIMA'FION, becomes a zero l)ronottn, the referent is you. Such constraints using both verbal semantic attributes and modal expressions can be used to determine the deictic reference of 3 apanese zero pronouns. To write constraints based on types of verbs eflbx:- tively, we used the 97 verbal semantic attributes (VSA) proposed by Nakaiwa (1994). 3.2.3 Constraints based on Conjunctions","Sometimes the deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns can be determined depending on the types of conjunctions. The constraints based on the Japanese conjunctions can be divided into the following two types. (1) The eonstralnts on <:as(; sharing depending on the types of conjunctions Minami (1974) and Takubo (1987) proposed that (lilt'event Japanese conjunctions cover or share different cases, l,'or example Minanfi divided Japanese conjnnctions into three kinds, A, B and C. A complex sentence which includes A type Japanese conjunctions, such as tsu-Lsu 'while' and nagara 'while', shares one ha-case ('l'opie) and one ga-ea,se (Subject). In the case of B type Japanese conjullctions, stlch a8 lzodc 'because' or tara 'iF, one ha.-c~e is shared but not the ga-case. In the case of C type J a I)an esc conj u actions, such as kcredo 'but' or kedo 'but', neither the ha-case nor the ga-case are necessarily shared. According to this classification, if two ga-cases in a complex sin> tence joined by an A type Japanese conjunction were to become zero pronouns and the referent of one of the two zero pronouns wins determined by the constraints proposed previously, then the referent of the other zero pronoun is the same referent. These characteristics of Japanese c(mjunc-tions can be used to determine the refit'rents of zero pronouns. (2) Constraints based on conjunctions, inodal expressions and verbal semantic attributes Sometimes co-occurrence of conjunctions, verbal semantic attributes and moda.l expressions in a complex sentence determines the meaning of the sentence, and sometimes they determine the deictic referen(;e of zero pronouns in the sentence. For example, in the following Japanese expression, th(~ subject of the verb ika-nai 'go-not' becomes a zero pronoun but the referent can be determin(;d as the writer or speaker, you.

As shown in","tAt the moment, it is difficult to use sentences which were not successfully syntactically and semantically a.nalyzed for the evaluation of our method. So, to evaluate the technical limitation of proposed method, we evaluated the resolution accuracy in the sentences which were examined to make the 46 rules (window test). We will conduct blind tests after we have finished debugging the whole system. this table, all 175 zero pronouns can be resolved using the rules that were proposed in section 3. The. introduction of verbal semantic attributes has achieved the same accuracy of resolution as the in-- troduction of modM expressions (41 entries, 24%). From this result, we can say that the verbal semantic attributes are comparatively as effective as modal expressions. The results also show that , without using the constraints of conjunctions, the accuracy achieved is as high as 85%. 4.3 Resolution Accuracy against Rule","Complexity To examine how the resolution accuracy varied according to the complexity of' rules, we tested the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper at different levels of complexity. The complexities C were evaluated using the following formula, and depended on the number of constraints used. C = # of modal const.* 1 + # of VSA coast.* 1","+ # of conjunctions coast.* 2 In this formula, 1 in the modal and VSA and 2 in the conjunction indicate the weights. Because conjunction constraints affect both sides of the unit sentence, we gave the conjunctions constraints a weight of 2. According to this formula, the complexity of a rule that has a constraint fbr conjunctions and for VSA in the main clause and for modM and VSA in the sub clause, becoines 5(-- l(modal)*l + I(VSA)*2 + 2(conjunction)*l).","Table 4 shows the accuracy of the resolution depending on the complexities of the rules. 46 kinds of rules were used in the deictic resolution of 175 zero pronouns as shown in |;able 4. The accuracy of resolution using rules with complexities of 3 or less, is 90%, and the accuracy of resolution using rules with complexities of 4 or less, is 95%. This result shows that the use of the constraints based on modM expressions, VSA and conjunctions can achieve high accuracy using relatively simple rules."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a powerful method for the resolution of Japanese zero pronouns with deictic reference.
