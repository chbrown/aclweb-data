Instructional texts do not simply consist of lists of imperatives: instructions may also describe, eulogise, inform and explain. Generating good-quality draft instructions requires a detailed specification of how to map from semantic representations of the task actions onto a wide range of linguistic expressions.","Our corpus is composed of naturally-occurring instructions in the three languages of study. Our overall approach is to obtain different-language drafts that are congruenl with the technical content embodied in the task to be performed (and with other relevant information about the task). A satisfactory level of congruence requires the use of syntactic and pragmatic rules appropriate to each target language, mat)ping fi'om the semantics to appropriate expression in a way that is frec from influence from any source language 1.

In section 2, we give a brief definition of generation and enablement, before going on in section 3 to describe how the two relations are realised in the corpus of Portuguese, English, and French instructions."]},{"title":"2 The Semantic Relations","paragraphs":["Generation and enablement are relations that can hold between pairs of states, events, processes, or actions. A simple test of generation holding between action pairs is whether it can be said that by performing one of the actions (a) under appropriate conditions, the other (/9) will automaticMly occur (Pollack, 1986). If so, it can be said that c, generates/). The two actions must be performed, or perceived to be performed, by the same human agent, and the two actions must be asymmetric (i.e. if a generates fl, then fl cannot generate a). Simple examples of generation are ~ follows: 3 (1) Heat gently to soften the coating.","(2) Dial the numbers of the Mercury authorisation code by pressing the appropriate numbers on the keypad.","In example 1, the action of heating gently ha~s the effect of softening the coating. In example 2, advantages of this approach over the inherent limitations of a translation-based approach to producing multilinguM instructions.","2See (Paris et al., 1995) for a discussion of the modelling of domain knowledge for instructions in the coiltext of a support tool for drafting instructional texts.","3So far, we have concentrated on examples of these semantic relations that do not cross sentence boundaries. 292 pressing the correct keypad numbers has the automarie effect of dialing the numbers of the Mercury authorisation code. In each case, by performing the ¢t action (or set of actions), the user has automatically performed the fl action. Note that the two actions can bc presented in either order: generatiNG first, or generatED first.","q'he term cnablemeut is commonly used to refer to the procedural relation between precondi-tions and actions. It obtains between two actions where the execution of the first brings about a set of conditions that are necessary, but not necessarily suJJicienl for the subsequent performance of the second (Pollack, 1986). This is different from the generation ('rose, since enablement requires the further intervention of an agent - and it need not be the same agent - to bring about the fl eventuality.","(3) (?lose cover and test a.s recornmended in 'Operation' section.","(4) l)br prolonged viewing, ttle slide may be pushed downwards and then backwards until it locks under the ledges at each end of the slot.","Example 3, taken from the instructions for a household smoke alarm, shows the enabliNG action appearil, g tirst: closing the cover enables test-ing to take place, but does not automatically result in a test. Example 4, front the instructions for a home photographic slide viewer, presents the enablED action ~ prolonged viewing - first, and describes to tile user what must be done to facilitate it.","These two relations have been formalised by Pollack (1986) and Balkanski (1993) for the purposes of plan recognition, and can be represented in a plan formalism that is a simple extension of STRll)S-styled operators developed by Fikes (1971) and expanded in the NOAII system (Sacerdoti, 1977). [Iere, we summarise the two relations in the form of the following planning statements:",",, (~ generates fl iff c~ is the body of a plan e","whose goal is ft.",",, oe enables fl if ce is a precondition of a plan e","and/3 is the goal of plan e, or iffl is the body","of e and t~ is a preconditkm of/3.","In order to generate instructions clearly, it must be obvious which, if either of the two relations is intended at any given point: eonflmion of one with the other will lead to inadequte, incomplete, or even dangerous execution of the t~k described."]},{"title":"3 From Semantics to Syntax","paragraphs":["Ilow, then, are generation and enablement realised in the three languages of study? In what follows, we look at the syntactic resources that are used in each language to convey the two parts of the two relations, and look at tile constraints on tile ordering of tile two parts; then, at what discourse markers play a role in further ensuring the clarity of the relation intended, and finally show how different rhetorical interpretations result from these choices. Together, these factors explain a significant amount of the cross-linguistic wtriation that occurs within the instructions sub-language, in what follows, however, it is not our intention to suggest an ordering tbr the set of de~ cisions that need to be made for generation: so far, our research suggests a complex interaction of factors is involved in choice of expression, and tim ther research is required to establish their relative priorities in the decision-making process.","Our corpora for the study consisted of 65 exampies of generation, and 65 examples of enablement for each of the three languages of study. 4 3.1 Syntacti(.

The imperative-simple, on the other hand, is identical in form to the second-person plural 6 indicative of the verb and its use is associated with identifiable addressees. The fact that this form accounts for 40% of imperatives in the corpus may be seen as evidence for the increasingly user-oriented style of instructions for household appliances.","Unlike in Portuguese, ordering does play a role in French. Both imperative-infinitive and imperative simple expressing generatED occur first, while a gerundive expressing generatiNG occurs second. In addition, Portuguese showed a strong differentiation between ED-specific and ING-specific forms, and therefore little overlap, but in French, overlap is much greater: only one form, the gerundive, is constrained to one part of the semantic relation (generatiNG).","English appears the most permissive in terms of both overlap between ED and ING-bearing expressions, and lack of influence of ordering - a combination of the characteristics of the other two languages. While there is a strong preference for infinitive and imperative forms, the influence of the part of the semantic relation only extends, as in French, to a single form: the appearance of the infinitive as an expression of generatED rather than generatiNG. The influence of ordering appears to be at the level of weak preferences, in line with Portuguese, rather than the stronger role seen in French generation.

Since our notion of semantic content is based on a formal model of the task plan to be conveyed to the instruction user, the significance of the approach is clear for developing natural language generation applications within this limited domain. In particular, for rhetorical planning of the communication of particular content, we can use the preferences observed for selection of the preferred rhetorical relation in the language in question. Second, we can use our knowledge of how that relation is constituted and expressed in terms of syntax for marking the relation appropriately.","The approach also reveals some interesting facts about the individual languages. In particular, we found different levels of tolerance of residual ambiguity: Portuguese has little ambiguity in the mapping from semantic content to syntactic realisation (the least ambiguous markers of rhetorical relation, fewest available syntactic realisations, least overlap in the roles of these realisations for conveying one or the other semantic relation, most restricted set of favoured rhetorical relations). English, on the other hand, had the opposite characteristics. We also found differing preferences for rhetorical relations in expressing semantic content: for example, while Portuguese expresses generation in over 80% of cases with the relation of PURPOSE, French generation divides this relation almost equally between PURPOSE and MEANS. The English corpus, on the other hand, while it has a strong showing for PURPOSE (around 50%), reveals a relatively strong showing (around 14%) for the relation of RESULT, a relation found in only 1.5% of the Portuguese relations and not at all in French.","No natural language has an unambiguous mapping from semantics to surface syntax, which makes the information encoded by syntax, both semantic and pragmatic, very difficult to consciously 'unpack' from surface form in the performance of the translation task. We suggest that uncovering the decisions necessary for producing pragmatically-appropriate sets of parallel instructions is a task best performed as an empirical study along the lines suggested here. In this way, we can encode language-specific pragmatic principles into tools that support the process of multilingual document production."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Cecile T.
