Motivation (Zaenen and Nunberg i995) notes that, (~ven as fully autontatic machine translation has receded a.s a reasonable mid-t,erm goal for natm'al language processing, several goals have emerged which are less ambitious, but LtSe['ul all(t att,ainable. These focus less on eliminating language loa.rriers and more on assisting peoI)h; in learning and understanding the wide. range of languages in current use. It, is still the. case t,hnt, language differences form a substantial barrier to the free [low of ideas and technologies: ideas are effec(,ively only a(-cessibh; only to l;hose in command of the la.nguagc they are (;xl)ressed in. But since an ever increasing number o[\" people encounter t,ext,s electronically, automated methods of language processing may be brought to bear on this problem. (ILOSSER-RuG is designed t,o hel t) peol)le who know a. bit of l!'rench but cannot read it; quickly or reliably. It allows a native Dutch pe.rson to learn more ahout, French morl)hology, it removes the tedious task of thumbing through the dictionary and it gives examples from corpora.","(?,LOSSH{-IhK~ may also be contrasted with more t,radil,ional compute.r-assisted language learning (CALl,) sol'twarc (l,ast 1992) which has lbcused primary on providing exercises, an-swer keys, and links to grammar explanations.

A long list of potential analyses is potentially of very little use. Since indeed most words are multiply ambiguons, a problem looms. 2.3 Disambigual;ion The solution to this problem is disambiguation: to find the right entry in the dictionary, a part-of-speech (POSt disambiguator is applied be[brc morphological analysis in order to obtain the eontextually most plausible morphological analysis.","For example in the sentence IJon, donnc-moi un baiscr 'Good, give me a kiss', the disambiguator should return a tag for the word baiser indicating [masculine] uoun and in the sentence IIne pent pas baiser 'tie can'(; kiss' the word baiser should be assigned with a tag indicating verb [infinitive]. The combination of POS disambiguator and morphological analysis suffice to provide the contextually most likely analysis nearly all the time. Stochastic POS disaml)iguation is implemented in the Rank Xerox Loeolex package. 2.4 Corpus The results of disambiguation and morpltologieel analysis serve not only as input to dictionary lookup hut also to corpus search. The current implementation of this sear(-h uses only string matching to find farther tokens. Our design calls for L1,;XEMb;-Dased search however, and a preliminary version of this has also been implemented.","In order to determine I;he size of corpus needed, wc experimented with a frequency list of the 10,000 most frequent words. A corpus of 2 MI3 contained 85% of these, and a corpus of 6 MII 100%. Our goal is 100% coverage of the words found in Hedcndaagsc [,'tans, aud 100% coverage of the most fi'equent 20,000 words, and we arc close to it. The current corpus size is 8 MB.","As the corpus grows, the time for incrcinental search likwise grows linearly. When the average search time grew to severed seconds (on a 70 MIltS UNIX server), it became apparent that some sort of indexing wa.s needed. This was implemented and is described in (win Slooten 1995). The in dexed lookup is most satisfactory- not only has the absolnte time dropped ~m order of magnitude, but the time appears to be constant when eorpns size is varied between 1 and 10 MB.","l~exeme-.based search looks not only lbr further occurrences of the same string, but Mso for thrice-"]},{"title":"832","paragraphs":["tional varbml;s of the word.
