Often though, a localist approaeh is adopted whereby the words are kept in alphabetical order with some representation of their definitions in the form of a template or feature structure. F, flbrt in find-lug cormections between words is seen in work on automatic extraction of sem~mtic relations Dora MRI)s (Ahlswede and Evens, 1988; Alshawi, 1989; Montemagrfi and Vandorwende, 19!32). Additionally, effort in finding words that are close semantically is seen by the current interest in statistical techniques for word clustering, looking at (-ooccurrences of words in text corpora or dictionaries (Church and IIanks, 1989; Wilks et al., 1989; Brown et al., 11992; l'ereira et al., 11995).","Inspired by research in the. areas of semantic relations, semantic distance, concept clustering, and using (,once I tual (Ji a l hs (Sowa, 1984) as our knowledge representation, we introduce (;oncept (?lustering I{nowledge Graphs (CCKGs).

This interaction will be set, within a lmrtieular domain, and the trigger word should be a key word of the domain to represent. 11' that process would be done for the whole dictionary, we would obtain an l,l( II divided into multiple clusters of words, each represented by a CCK(].

The primary building blocks for the CCKG are the temporary graphs built from the dictionary definitions of those words using our transformation process mentioned in the previous section. Those temporary graphs express similar or related ideas in different ways and with different levels of detail. As we will try to put all this information together into one large graph, we must first find what information the various temporary graphs have in common and then join them around this common knowledge.","To help us build this CCKG and perform our integration process, we assume two main knowledge structures are available, a concept hierarchy and a relation hierarchy, and we assume the existance of some graph operations. The concept hierarchy concentrates on nouns and verbs as they account for three quarters of the dictionary definitions. It has been constructed automatically according to the techniques described in (Barri~re and Popowich, To appear August 1996). The relation hierarchy was constructed manually. A rich hierarchical structure between the set of relations is essential to the graph matching operations we use for the integration phase.","As we are using the conceptual graph formalism to represent our definitions, we can use the graph 66 matching operations defined in (Sowa, 1984). The t, wo operations we will need are the maximal common subgraph algorithm and the maximal join algorithm. 3.1. Maximal common subgraph The maximal common subgraph between two graphs consists of finding a subgraph of tile first graph that is isomorphic to a subgraph of the see-ond graph. In our case, we cannot often expect to find two graphs that contain an identical subgral)h with the exact same relations and concepts. Ideas cart be expressed in many ways and we therefore need a more relaxed matching schema. We describe a few elements of this \"relaxation\" process and illustrate them by an example in Figure 2.","(1) John makes a nice drawing on a piece of paper with the pen.","[make]- >(sub)- >[John] - >(obj)- >[drawing]- >(nit)- >[nice] - >(on)- >[piece]- >(or)- >[paper] ->(with)- >[pen]","(2) John uses the big crayon to draw rapidly on the paper.","[(haw]- >(sub)- >[John l ->(on)->[paper] - >(inst ........ t)- > [crayon] - >(manner)- >[rapidly]","MAXIMAl, COMMON SUBGRAPn:","[make(draw)]- >(sub)- >[John] - >(obj)- >[drawing] - >(on)->[piece]- >(of)->[paper] - >(instrument)- >[label-11 ~ method l~elation subsumption Predictable meaning Mdft nelation t r~nsitivity graphl ] graph2 pell cr~yoll with instrument drawing dr~w piece of paper p~per","MAXIMAL JOIN:","[make(draw)]- >(sub)- >[John] - >(obj)- > [drawing]- >(art)- >[nice] - >(o.)- > [piece]- >(of)- >[paperl ->(inst ...... t)->[l~b¢l-1] ->( ......... )->[rapidly] Figure 2: Example of \"relaxed\" maximal common sui)graph and maximal join algorithms Semantic distance between concepts. In the maximal common subgraph algorithm proposed by (Sow% :1984), two concepts (C1,CY) could be matched if one snbsumed the other in the concept hierarchy. We can relax that criteria to match two concepts when a third concept C which subsumes C1 and C2 has a high enough degree of informativeness (Resnik, 1995). The concept hierarchy can be useful in many cases, but it is generated from the dictionary and might not be complete enough to find all similar concepts.","In the example of Figure 2, when using tile concept hierarchy to establish the similarity between pen and crayon, we find that; one is a subclass of lool and the other of wax, both then are substoned by the general concept something. We have reached the root of the noun tree in the concept hierarchy and this would give a similarity of 0 based on the informativeness notion.","We extend the subsumption notion to the graphs. Iustead of finding a concept that subsulnes two concepts, we will try finding a common subgraph that subsumes the graph representation of both concepts. In our example, pen and crayon have a common subgraph [write]->(inst)->~. The notion of semantic distance can be seen as the informativeness of the subsuming graph. The resuiting maximal comlnon snbgraph as shown in Figure 2 contains the concept label-1. This label is associated to a covert category ~s presented in (Barri~re and Popowich, To appear August 1996). We carl update tile concept hierarchy and add this label-1 as a subclass of something and a superclass of pen and crayon. It expresses a concept of \"writ-ing instrument\".","t Relation subsmnption. Since we have a relation hierarchy in addition to our concept hierarchy, we can similarly use subsumption to match two relations. In i,'igure 2, with is subsumed by instrument, and by lnapping them, we disantbiguate wilh from corresponding to another semantic relation, such as possession or accompaniment. This is a case where an arnbiguons preposition left in the temporary graph is resolved by the integration process. Predictable meaning shift. A set of lexical implication rules were developed by (Ostler and Atkins, 1992) for relating word senses. Based on them, we are developing a set of graph matching rules. Figure 2 exemplifies one of theln where two graphs containing the same word (or morphologically related), here draw and drawing, used as different parts of speech can be related. Relation transitivity. Some relations, like part-of, in, from can be transitive. For example, we can map a graph that contains a concept A in a certain relation to concept B onto another graph where concept A is in the same relation with a part or a piece of B as exemplified in Figure 2. Transitivity in relations is in itself a challenging area of study (Cruse, 1986) and we have only begun to explore it. 3.2 Maximal join The basic operation for the integration of temporary graphs is the maximal join operation where a union of two graphs is formed around their maximal common subgraph using the most specific concepts of each. We just saw how to relax the maximal common subgraph operation and we will perform the join around that \"relaxed\" subgraph. Figure 2 shows the result of the maximal join. The join operation allows us to bring new conccpts into a graph by finding relations with ex-57 isting concepts, as well as bringing new relations between existing concepts. 3.3 Integration process Given the concept hierarchy, relation hierarchy and graph matching operations, we now describe the two major steps required to integrate all the temporary graphs into a CCKG. TRIGGER. PHASE. Start with a central word, a keyword for the subject of interest that becomes the trigger word. The temporary graph built from the trigger word forms the initial CCKG. To expand its meaning, we want to look at the important concepts involved and use their respective temporary graphs to extend our initial graph. We deem words in the definition to be important if they have a large semantic weight.","2.'he semantic weight of a word or its informativeness can be related to its frequency (l~esnik, 1995). Itere, we calculate the number of occur-rence of each word within the definitions of nouns and verbs in our dictionary.

Only 1% of the words occur more than 130 times, 5% occur more than 30 times but over 60% occur less than 5 times.","Ordering the dictionary words in terms of decreasing number of occurrences, the top 10% of these words account for 75% of word occurrences. For our current investigation, we propose this as the division between semantically significant words, and semantically insignificant ones. So a word from the dictionary is deemed to be semantically significant if it occurs less than 17 times. Note that constraining the number of semantically significant words is important in limiting the exploration process tbr constructing the concept cluster, as we shall soon see.","Trigger forward: Find the semantically significant words fi'om the CCKG, and join their respective temporary graphs to the initial CCKG.","Trigger backward: Find all the words in the dictionary that use the trigger word in their definition and join their respective temporary graphs to the CCKG.","Instead of a single trigger word, we now have a cluster of words that are related through the CCKG. Those words ,form the"]},{"title":"concept cluster.","paragraphs":["EXPANSION PHASE. We try finding words in the dictionary containing many concepts identical to the ones already present in the CCKG but perhaps interacting through different relations allowing us to create additional links within the set of concepts present in the CCKG. Our goal is to create a more interconnected graph rather than sprouting from a particular concept. For this reason, we establish a graph matching threshold to decide whether we will join a new graph to the CCKG being built. We set this threshold empirically: the maximal common subgraph between the CCKG and the new temporary graph must contain at least three concepts connected through two relations.","Expansion forward: For each semantically significant word in the CCKG, not already part of the concept cluster, find the maximal common subgraph between its temporary graph and the CCKG. If matching surpasses the graph matching threshold, perform integration (maximal join operation) and add the word in the concept cluster. Continue forward until no changes are made.","Expansion backward: Find words in the dictionary whose definitions contain the semantically significant words from the concept cluster. For each possible new word, find the maximal common subgraph between its temporary graph and the CCKG. Again, if matching is over the graph matching threshold, perform integration and add the word to the concept cluster. Continue until no changes are made.","We can set a limit to the number of steps in the expansion phase to ensure its termination. Ilowever in practice, M'ter two or three steps forward or backward, the maximal common subgraphs between the new graphs and CCKG do not exceed the graph matching threshold and thus are not added to the cluster, terminating the expansion. 3.4 Example of integration Figure 3 shows the starting point of an integration process with the trigger word (TW)"]},{"title":"lelter,","paragraphs":["its definition, its temporary graph (TG), the concept cluster (CC) containing only the trigger word, and the CCKG being the same as the temporary graph.
