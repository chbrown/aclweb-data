The latter also involves other static microtheories describing world kalowledge and syntax-semantics mapping as well as dynamic microtheories comlected with the actual process of text analysis. Tiffs paper describes our approach to detecting ,'rod recording adjectival meaning, compares it with the body of kalowledge on adjectives in literature and presents a detailed, practically tested methodology for the acquisition of lexical entries for adjecfives. The work was based on the set of over 6,000 English and about 1,500 Spanish adjectives obtained from task-oriented corpora."]},{"title":"1. The Ontological Approach","paragraphs":["The work on adjectives reported in tlfis paper constitutes a descriptive \"microtheory\" in the MikroKosmos semantic analyzer (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg 1994; and Beale et ,'d. 1995), designed to serve as a component of a lolowledge-based machine translation system (Nircnburg ct al. 1992).","MikroKosmos combines findings from a variety of quasi-antonomous microtheories of language phenomena, world knowledge organization and procedural knowledge at the level of coinputer system arclfitectnrc. The basic motivation for this organization is the continued inability of the fields of lingnistics and NLP to produce a general-coverage, unified theory of trealment of language phenomena, a failure especially pronoanced in ,areas beyond computational syntax.","The purpose and result of the MikroKosmos mmlysis process is the derivation of an interlingnal representation for natm'al language inlmts. The langtmge in which these representations arc expressed is called file \"text meaning representation\" (I'MR) langlmge, mid \"texts\" in dais language are called, simply, TMRs. TMR is a fr,'une-based language, where frame names typically refer to instances of ontological concepts, slot names are derived from a set of ontological properties and slot fillers ,are either elements of property value sets or pointers to concept instances.","An ontology, a world model containing ilfformation about types of things, events mid properties in the world, is a necessary prerequisite for a TMR language. \"An ontology for NLP purposes is a body of knowledge about the world (or a domain) that a) is a repository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in a tangled subsumption hierarchy; • and c) further intercom~ects these symbols using a rich system of semmltic and discourse-pragmatic rela-tions defined among the concepts\" (Mahesh and Nirenburg 1995: 1). The function of the ontology is to supply \"world knowledge to lexical, syntactic, and semantic processes\" (ibid).","The lexicon in MikroKosInos \"mediates between the TMR ,and ontology\" (Onyshkevyeh and Nirenburg 1994: 2). Lexicon entries for most open-class lexieal items represent word and plu:ase senses, which c~m be either directly mapped into ontological concepts or derived by locally (that is, in the lexicon entry itself) modifying constraints on property wducs of concepts used to specify the meaning of the given lexical item. L6xicalsenmntie information as well as clues for contextual semantic and pragmatic processing are typically located in the lexicon, adjectives being no exception. In the following section we illustrate file structnre of those parts of the lexicon entry in MikroKosmos which bear on the description of adjectival memfing."]},{"title":"2. The Ontological Approach to the Meaning of a Typical Adjective","paragraphs":["A simple, l~rototypical case of adjectival modification is a scalar adjective, which modifies a noun both syntactically and semantically. Our microtheory associates its meaning with a region on a scale which is defined as the range of ml ontological property (cf. Carlson and Nix~enburg, 1990). Tile contribution that the adjective makes to the construction of a semantic dependency structure 842 (FMR) typic'ally consists of inserting its meaning (a property-value p,'fir) as a slot filler in a frame representing the me,-ming of the noun whidl this adjective syntactically modifies.","Thus, in"]},{"title":"big house, big","paragraphs":["will assigu a high value as the filler of the property slot SIZE of the frame for the me,'m-ing of"]},{"title":"house.","paragraphs":["The range of the ontological property SIZE is a numerical and continuous scale.

There has been a sporadic interest in the adjective fake (see Iw,'mska 1995--cf.

But there are many other adjectives which use exactly the same type of lexical entry, and their similarity to each other and to fake had not been noticed before.","The most typical adjectives in the member subclass are authentic (6),fake (7), and nominal (8). Many others are their synonyms and near-synonyms. The lexical entry for Otis subclass focuses on two major elements: first, wheflmr tile modified norm is a member of a certain set--anthentic and nominal members ,are but fake members are not; and, second, whether the properties of tiffs noun intersect significantly with those of tile set members--the properties of authentic members overlap with the common properties of the set meinbers on most import,'mt properties; the properties of fake members overlap with those of the set members only on unimportant properties, such as physical resembl,'mce--e.g.fake gun; and the properties of nominal members overlap more significantly with those of the set members bat not on the most important ones.","The first element is represented ill a set notation: setl shows that $̂varl belongs to the set, whose typical member is denoted by a variable refseml, in tile ease of authentic and nominal but not in file case of fake.
