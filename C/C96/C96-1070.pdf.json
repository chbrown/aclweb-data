Thereibre, assuring efficiency in spoken-language translation is one of the most crucial tasks in devising such a system. In spoken language, the translation of lengthy utterances can yield a huge amount of structural ambiguity, which needs to be efficiently processed by the system. As a solution for achieving an efficient spoken-language system, several techniques, such as incremental generation (Finkler, 1992; Kempen, 1987) and marker-passing memory-based translation (Kitano, 1994), have been proposed. Many of these techniques adopt a left-to-right strategy to handle an input incrementally and a best-first strategy to avoid the explosion of structural ambiguity. These strategies (:an be achieved with bottom-up processing.","We have already proposed Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT) for efficient and robust spoken-language translation (Furuse, 1994a; Furuse, 1994b). However, the top-down and breadth-first translation strategy in the earlier versions of TDMT, which yields a quick response for inputs with restricted lengths, may show poor efficiency when processing a very lengthy input or inputs having many competing structures.","In a top-down and breadth-first application, all the possible structures are retained until the whole input string is parsed. This requires many computations and results in inefficient translation. For instance, the sentence below has many competing structures, mainly because of possible combinations within noun sequences. If this expression is combined with another expression, the structurM ambiguity will be further compounded.","With bacon chicken eggs lettuce and tomato on it.","In contrast, if structural ambiguities of substrings are always settled and are never inherited to the upper structures, the explosion of structurM ambiguity could be constrained. Thus, an incremental strategy that fixes partial results is necessary for efficient processing and is achieved by bottom-up processing in left-to-right order.","This paper proposes TDMT using an incremental strategy for achieving efficient translation of a lengthy input or one having a lot of structural ambiguity. In this method, several constituent boundary patterns are applied to an input string in a bottom-up fashion. This bottom-up application, based on the concept of chart parsing, can constrain the explosion of structural ambiguity by dealing with best-only substructures using semantic distance calculations.","In this paper, we will first; outline our new translation strategy. We will then explain how constituent boundary patterns can be used to describe the structure of an input string in TDMT. Then we will describe the bottom-up pattern application, based on chart parsing. Next, we will show how the explosion of structural ambiguity is constrained by dealing with the best-only substructures, based on semantic distance calculations. By comparing the preliminary experimental results from the former top-down method and those from our new method, we will demonstrate the usefulness of our new method. A summary of our approach will conclude the paper."]},{"title":"2 Translation strategy","paragraphs":["In TDMT, translation is performed by applying stored empirical transfer knowledge, which de-412 scribes the correspondence between source language expressions and target language expressions at various linguistic levels. The source and target expressions of tile transfer knowledge in TDMT arc ext)ressed by constituent boundary patterns, which represent meaningful units for linguistic structure and transfer. An efficient application of transfer knowledge source parts to an input string plays a key role in achieving quick translation.","The procedure R)r applying constituent boundary patterns is perfomed after the assignment of morphological information to each word of an input string, and is as follows: (a) Insertion of constituent boundary marker; (b) 1)eriw~tion of possible structures;","(e) Structural disambiguation 1)y semantic dislance calculation.","In the top-down and breadth-tirst pattern application, the above procedure is executed in the described order. Because the selection of the best structure might have to be postponed until all possible structm'es are derived, the costs of translation could be high.","In contrast, the incremental method determines the best structure locally and (-an constrain the number of competing structures fbr the whole input by performing (b) in l)arallel with (c); consequently, translation costs are reduced.","The structure selected in (c) (:ontains its transt~rred result and head word infbrination, which is used for semantic distance calculation when combining with other structures. The output sentence is generated as a translation result Dora the structure for the whole inl)ut, which is composed of best-first substructures.","In the three subsequent sections, we will explain (a), (b), and (c), focusing on the bottoir>up and best-first translation strategy."]},{"title":"3 Constituent boundary pattern","paragraphs":["In this section we will briefly explain how constituent boundary patterns are used to describe the structure of an int)ut string in TI)MT and what procedures arc applied before constituent boundary pattern applications (Furuse, 1994b).","We will show bottom-up pattern application by translating the following sample English sentence into Japanese:","Thc bus goes to Chinatown at ten a.m. First, all the words in this sequence are assigned","the following parts-of-speech. article, noun, verb, preposition, proper-noun,","preposition, numeral, postnominal","A constituent boundary pattern is defined as a sequence that; consists of variables and symbols representing constituent boundaries. A variable corresponds to some linguistic constituent and is expressed as a capital letter (e.g. X). A constituent boundary is expressed by either a functional word or a part-of-speech bigram marker (e.g. noun-verb). Variables in tile source language expression must be separated by constituent boundaries.","For instance, the expression \"goes to Chinatown\" is divided into two constituents, i.e. \"goes\" and \"Chinalown\". The preposition \"1o\" can be identified as a constituent boundary. Therefor(;, in parsing \"goes to Chinatown\", we use the pattern \"X to Y', which has two variables X and Y and a constituent boundary \"to\".","'l'he expression \"the b~zs goes\" can be divided into two constituents \"the bud' and \"goes\". Howeve.r, there is no flmctional surface word that divides the expression into two constituents. In such ('ases, we emt)loy part-of-speech bigrams as boundary markers. \"bus\" and \"goes\" are a noun and a verb, respectively. Thus the marker noun-verb can be inserted as a boundary marker into the input \"the bus goes\", giving \"The bus noun-verb goes\". This sequence will now match tile general transfer knowledge pattern \"X noun-verb Y\".","Of the possible bigrams in the above part-of~ speech sequence, only \"noun-verb\" is an eligible constituent boundary marker (Fro:use, 1994b). This marker is inserted into the above sentence: The bus noun-verb goes to Chinatown at ten a.m.","Indices to possible patterns are obtained from several words and bigrams in the above m~rker-inserted string (Table 1).

A variable on a given level 413 is instantiated by a string on the lingustic levels in the second column of Table 2. For instance, in the noun phrase \"X of F', the variables X and Y cannot be instantiated by a simple sentence, but can be instatiated by a noun phrase, a compound noun, and so on. Table 2: Possible linguistic sublevels in variables linguistic level sublevels of variables simple sentence VP, NP, ... verb phrase (VP) VP, NP, verb, ... noun phrase (NP) NP, CN, proper-noun .... compound noun (CN) CN, noun,...","According to the regulation of the linguistic levels' relations shown in Table 2, a marker-inserted string is parsed using the constituent boundary patterns. 4.2 Active and passive arcs A chart parsing method (Kay, 1980) can avoid repeatedly recomputing partial results and achieve incremental processing by using a bottom-up and left-to-right strategy. In chart parsing, an input string is parsed by combining active and passive arcs. These can be assigned to a substring of an input string when a pattern is applied to it. If all the variables of the applied pattern are instantiated or a substring can be matched to a pattern whose variables are all instantiated, a passive arc is created for the substring. When a substring can be matched to the left part of a pattern and the right variables of the pattern are not instatiated, an active arc is created for the substring.","In conventional chart parsing, many arcs can be created because every word can create active and passive arcs based on its part-of-speech. Also, many arcs can be chained via non-terminal symbols such as a part-of-speech and NP (noun phrase). For instance, the pronoun, \"f' can create many active arcs relevant to the rules \"Pronoun","1\", \"NP ~ Pronoun\" and \"S --+ NP VP\", which can be chained. Therefore, a lot of computation is required in conventional chart parsing.","In contrast, chart parsing with constituent boundary patterns can constrain the number of arc creations because only an constituent boundary creates active arcs while a variable (e.g. X) never creates an arc. We obtain indices to patterns from each word of the sentence. With these indices, patterns are retrieved and checked to determine whether each of them can create an arc. 4.3 Pattern application algorithm Our algorithm for bottom-up application of patterns is as follows. If the whole input string can be covered with a passive arc, the parsing will succeed and the derivation of the passive arc will be the parsed result.","1. If the processed string is a content word (e.g. noun, verb) create a passive arc.","2. If the processed string is a constituent boundary \"a\", create each kind of arc as follows, according to the pattern I retrieved from the constituent boundary.","2a. If the retrieved pattern is of the type \"X a Y\" and a left-neighboring passive arc can satisfy the condition for X's instantiation, create an active arc for \"X a F', in which Y has not yet been instantiated.","2b. If the retrieved pattern is of the type \"X a\" and a left-neighboring passive arc can satisfy the condition for X's instantiation, create a passive are for \"X a\".","2c. If the retrieved pattern is of the type \"a ~', create an active arc for \"a ~'.","3. If the created passive arc satisfies the leftmost part of an uninstantiated variable in the pattern of neighboring active arcs, the variable is instantiated with the passive arc, and a new passive or active arc is created. If a passive arc is generated in this operation, repeat the procedure until a new arc can no longer be created.","Figure 1 shows how an input string is parsed using our bottom-up chart method. A solid line denotes a passive arc that covers a substring of the input below, while a dotted line denotes an active arc.","The content words \"bus\", \"goes\", \"Chinatown\" and \"ten\" create passive arcs. The functional word \"the\", which is relevant to the pattern \"a X\", creates an active arc. The assignment of the functional word \"a.m.\" to the pattern \"X a\" creates a passive arc by combining another passive arc. The boundary markers \"noun-verb\", \"to\" and \"at\", which are relevant to the pattern \"X a Y\", create active arcs by combining left-neighboring passive arcs.","First \"the\" creates the active arc (1) relevant to the pattern \"the X\". \"bug' creates the passive arc (2).

Only the best substructure can be retained and combined with other arcs. 5.1 Semantic distance The most appropriate st~ructure is selected by computing tile total sum of all possible combinations of partial semantic distance values. The structure with the least total distmme is judged most consistent with empirical knowledge and is chosen as the most plausible structure.","The semantic distance between words is calculated according to the relationship of tim positions of words' semantic attributes in the thesaurus. The distance between expressions is the sum of the distance between the words comprising the expressions, multiplied by some weights (Sumita, 1992). 5.2 Head word information The head words within variable bindings serve as input for distance calculations. An input for distance calculation consists of head words in variable parts. The head part is designated in each pattern. Table 3 shows the head parts of the possible substructures for \"goes to Chinatown at ten a.m.\", which corresponds to the passive arc (19).

Thus, in \"X at Y\" for the structure in (19), the input for distance calculation is \"goes\" for \"3;\"' and \"a.m.\" for \"Y\". Since the head of \"X at Y\" is designated as \"X', \"goes\" becomes the [lead word for (19). This information is used when (19) is combined with another substring. 5.3 Structure selection The difference in total distance value between the two possible structures is due only to the distance value of \"X at F'.

While language-oriented modules, such as morphological analysis and generation, are provided to treat multi-lingual translation, the transfer module, which is a central component, is a common part of the translation system for every language pair. The system is written in LISP and runs on a UNIX machine. Presently, the prototype system can translate bilingually between Japanese and English and between Japanese and Korean. In English-to-Japanese translation, the present vocabulary size is about 3,000 words 3 and the number of training sentences is about 2,000. 6.2 Experimental results We have compared translation times in the TDMT prototype system for two cases. One case utilizes top-down application; the other case utilizes the new application method presented in this paper, which adopts bottom-up pattern application and retains only one substructure using semantic distance calculation. The translation times are measured using a Spare10 workstation.","We have experimented with the translation times of some English sentences into Japanese. The following sentences cause only minor structural ambiguity.
