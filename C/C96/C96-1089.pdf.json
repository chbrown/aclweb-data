Our method com-525 prises two steps: (1) extracting useful word chunks (n-grams) by word-level sorting and (2) constrnct-ing bilingual collocations by combining the word-chunks acquired at stage (1). Given sentence-aligned texts in two languages(Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996), the first step detects useful word chunks by sorting and counting all uninterrupted word sequences in sentences. In this phase, we developed a new technique for extracting only useful chunks. The second step of the method evaluates the statistical similarity of the word chunks appearing in the corresponding sentences. Most of the fixed (uninterrupted) collocations are directly extracted from the word chunks. More flexible (interrupted) collocations are acquired level by level by iteratively combining the chunks. The proposed method, which uses effective word-level sorting, not only extracts fixed collocations with high precision, but also avoids the combinatorial explosion involved in searching flexible collocations. In addition, our method is robust and suitable for real-world applications because it only as-sumes part-of-speech taggers for both languages. Even if the part-of-speech taggers make errors in word segmentation, the errors can be recovered in the word chunk extraction stage.","2 Two Types of Japanese-English Collocations In this section, we briefly classify the types of Japanese-English collocations by using the material in Table 1 as an example. These texts were derived from a stock market bulletin written in Japanese and its abstract written in English, which were distributed electrically via a computer network.","In Table 1, (~g-~,~'l-~/Tokyo Forex), (H~I~!IYJ ~[~n~]{~ /auto talks between Japan and the U.S.) and (~k,.'~/ahead of) are Japanese-English collocations whose elements constitute uninterrupted word sequences. We call hereafter this type of collocation fixed eolloeatlon. Although fixed collocation seems trivial, more than half of all useful collocations belong to this class. Thus, it is important to extract fixed collocations with high precision. In contrast, ( b')t-t~'~ ~ ~1~ ¢ki~?,_ ~ / The U.S. currency was quoted at -~ ) and ( b\" )t.~'~ ~ ~l~ ~k_2~ /The dollar stood ..~)1 are constructed from interrupted word sequences. We will call this type of collocation flexible collocation. From the viewpoint of machine learning, flexible collocations are much more difficult to learn because they involve the combination of elements. The points when extracting flexible collocations is how the number of combination (can-didates) can be reduced.","Our learning method is twofold according to the collocation types. First, useful uninterrupted 1 ~. represents any sequence of words. word chunks are extracted by the word-level sorting method. To find out fixed collocations, we evaluate stochastic similarity of the chunks. Next, we iteratively combin the chunks to extract flexible collocations.","3 Extracting Useful Chunks by Word-Level Sorting 3.1 Previous Research With the availability of large corpora and memory devices, there is once again growing interest in extracting n-grams with large values of n. (Nagao and Mori, 1994) introduced an efficient method for calculating an arbitrary number of n-grams from large corpora. When the length of a text is I bytes, it occupies l consecutive bytes in memory as depicted in Figure 1. First, another table of size l is prepared, each field of which represents a pointer to a substring. A substring pointed to by the (i - 1)th entry of the table constitutes a string existing from the ith character to the end of the text string. Next, to extract common substrings, the pointer table is sorted in alphabetic order. Two adjacent words in the pointer table are compared and the lengths of coincident prefix parts are counted(Gonnet et al., 1992).","For example, when 'auto talks between Japan and the U.S.' and 'auto talks between Japan and China' are two adjacent words, the nmnber of coincidences is 29 as in 'auto talks between Japan and '. The n-gram frequency table is constructed by counting the number of pointers which represent the same prefix parts. Although the method is efficient for large corpora, it involves large volume of fractional and unnecessary expressions. The reason for this is that the method does not consider the inter-relationships between the extracted strings. That is, the method generates redundant substrings which are subsumed by longer strings. text ntr|hg (I oharaoter~: I bytes) la, ol.ter table Figure 1: Nagao's Approach","To settle this problem, (Ikehara et al., 1996) proposed a method to extract only useful strings. Basically, his methods is based on the longest-match principle. When the method extracts a longest n-gram as a chunk, strings subsumed by the chunk are derived only if the shorter string of_ tell appears independently to the longest chunk. If 'auto talks between Japan and the U.5'.' is extracted as a chunk, 'Japan and the U.S.'is also 526 Tokyo Forex 5 PM: Dollar at 84.21-84.24 yen The dollar stood 0.26 yen lower at 84.21-84.24 at 5 p.m. Forex market trading was extremely quiet ahead of fnrther auto talks between Japan and the U.S., slated for early dawn Tuesday. The U.S. currency was quoted at 1.361-1.3863 German marks at 5:15 p.m. Table 1: Sample of Target Texts extracted because 'Japan and the U.S.' is used so often independently as in 'Japan and the U.S. agreed ...'. However, 'Japan and the' is not extracted because it always appears in the context of 'Japan and the U.S.'. The method strongly suppresses fractional and unnecessary expressions. More than 75 % of the strings extracted by Nagao's method are removed with the new method. 3.2 Word-Level Sorting Method al Ipl l"]},{"title":"I@ i","paragraphs":["I [dl@~tlh]"]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["poln~r","imbl~","¢O:~nl","~llm~r Figure 2: Word-Level Sorting Approach","The research described in the previous section deals with character-based n-grams, which generate excessive numbers of expressions and requires large memory for the pointer table. Thus, from a practical point of view, word-based n-grams are preferable in order to further suppress fractional expressions and pointer table use. In this paper, we extend Ikehara's method to handle word-based n-grams. First, both Japanese and English texts are part-of-speech (POS) tagged 2 and stored in memory as in Figure 2. POS tagging is required for two main reasons: (1) There are no explicit word delimiters in Japanese and (2) By using POS information, useless expressions can be removed.","In Figure 2, '@' and '\\0' represent the explicit word delimiter and the explicit sentence delimiter, respectively. Compared to previous research, this data structure has the following advantages.","2We use in this phase the JUMAN morphological analyzing system (Kurohashi et al., 11994) for tagging Japanese texts and Brill's transformation-based tagget (Brill, 1994) for tagging English texts. We would like to thank all people concerned for providing us with the tools.","1. Only heads of each word are recorded in the pointer table. As depicted in Figure 2, this remarkably reduces memory use because the pointer table also contains other string characteristics as Figure 3.","2. As depicted in Figure 2, only expressions within a sentence are considered by introducing the explicit sentence delimiter '\\0'.","3. Only word-level coincidences are extracted by introducing the explicit word delimiter '@'. This removes strings arising from a partial match of different words. For example, the coincident string between 'Japan and China' and 'Japan and Costa Rica' is 'Japan and'in our method, while it is 'Japan and C' in previous methods. colnol"]},{"title":"~°ont adopt dance","paragraphs":["~4 (15 1-/0","2 I lC)*I 104 string I0 I¢) 16 I 6 16","J~p.","n~-v andc~a","¢","\"h","m,,ov","J,..,.,,<.o...tc.~,c'o.,.","~1o.","a","ap.","n~-q an d¢,~","t","|~,*~","1","Js","Ju","pa","t","t(~ an,tC,~","t","I~","U","S","J","it","pit","t~ ttn¢U~,","t","I~<~","~","I","S","Ja","p","a i ~¢U ~n","(ICa)","II~C~O_","•","/ Figure 3: Sorted Pointer Table","Next, the pointer table is sorted in alphabetic order as shown in Figure 3.

Note here that the coincidence between Japan@and@China... and Japan@and@Costa Rica... is l0 as mentioned above.","Next, in order to remove useless subsumed strings, the pointer table is sorted according to sentno.. In this stage, adopt is filled with '1' or '0' , each of which represents if or not if a string is subsumed by longer word chnnks, respectively. Sorting by sentno, makes it much easier to check the subsumption of word chunks. When 527 both 'Japan and the U.S.' and 'Japan and the' arise from a sentence, the latter is removed because the former subsumes the latter.","Finally, to determine which word-chunks to extract, the pointer table is sorted once again in alphabetic order.

First, fixed collocations are induced in the following way. We use the contingency matrix to evaluate the similarity of word-chunk occurrences in both languages.

The contingency matrix shows: (a) the number of Japanese-English corresponding sentence pairs in which both Cjp n and ce,~g were found, (b) the number of Japanese-English corresponding sentence pairs in which just c~, v was found, (c) the number of Japanese-English corresponding sentence pairs in which just ejp,~ was fonnd, (d) the mnnber of Japanese-English col responding sentence pairs in which neither chunk was found.","Ceng a b c d Table 2: Contingency Matrix","If ejpn and Cen.q are good translations of one another, a should be large, and b and c should bc small.

Thresholding the mutual information extracts fixed collocations.

About half of Table 4 and all of Table 3 are not listed in the dictionary. In particular, no verb-phrase or sentence-level collocations are not covered. These collocations are more useful for translators than noun phrase collocations, but greatly differ from domain to domain. Thus, it is difficult in general to hand-compile a dictionary that contains these kinds of collocations. Because our method automatically extracts these collocations, it will be of significant use in compiling domain specific dictionaries.","Finally, we briefly describe the coverage of the proposed method. For the corpus examined, 70 % of the fixed collocations and 35 % of the flexible collocations output by the method were correct. This level of performance was achieved in the face of two problems.","• The English text was not a literal translation. Parts of Japanese sentence were often omitted and sometimes appeared in a different English sentence.","• The data set was too small.","We are now constructing a larger volume of corpus to address the second problem. 6 Conclusion We have described a new method for learning bilingual collocations from parallel corpora. Our method consists of two steps: (1) extracting useful word chunks by the word-level sorting technique and (2) constructing bilingual collocations by combining these chunks. This architecture reflects the fact that fixed collocations play a more crucial role than accepted in previous research. Our method not only extracts fixed collocations with high precision but also reduces the combinatorial explosion that would be otherwise considered inescapable in extracting flexible collocations. Although our research is in the preliminary stage and tested with a small number of Japanese stock market bulletins and their English, the experimental results have shown a number of interesting collocations that are not contained in a dictionary of economic terms.
