This data set is obtained by means of a phrasal grammar whose patterns characterize the composition of a noun phrase (NP) in terms of possible token sequences. The output of NP identification is a set of token/feature matrix/offset sequences, where offset value is determined by the offset of the first token in the sequence. The offset indicates the position of the NP in the text, and so provides crucial information about precedence relations.","A secondary data set consists of observations about the syntactic contexts in which the NPs identified by the phrasal grammar appear. These observations are derived using a set of patterns designed to detect nominal sequences in two subordinate syntactic environments: containment in an adverbial adjunct and containment in an NP (i.e., containment in a prepositional or clausal complement of a noun, or containment in a relative clause).

A particularly convenient implementation of discourse referents is to represent them as objects in the Common Lisp Object System, with slots which encode the following information parameters (where ADJUNCT and EMBED indicate whether a discourse referent was observed in either of the two syntactic contexts discussed above): TEXT: text form TYPE: referential type (e.g., REF, PRO, RFLX) AGR: person, number, gender GFUN: grammatical function ADJUNCT: T or NIL EMBED: T or NIL POS: text position Note that each discourse referent contains information about itself and the context in which it appears, but the only information about its relation to other discourse referents is in the form of precedence relations (as determined by text position). The absence of explicit information about configurational relations marks the crucial difference between our algorithm and the Lappin/Leass algorithm. (Lappin and Leass, 1994) use configurational information in two ways: as a factor in the determination of the salience of a discourse referent (discussed below), and as input to a set of disjoint reference filters. Our implementation seeks to perform exactly the same tasks by inferring hierarchical relations from a less rich base. The modifications and assumptions required to accomplish this goal will be highlighted in the following discussion. 2.2 Anaphora resolution Once the representation of the text has been recast as a set of discourse referents (ordered by offset value), it is sent to the anaphora resolution algorithm proper. The basic logic of the algorithm parallels that of the Lappin/Leass algorithm. The interpretation procedure involves moving through the text sentence by sentence and interpreting the discourse referents in each sentence from left to right. There are two possible in-terpretations of a discourse referent: either it is taken to introduce a new participant in the discourse, or it is taken to refer to a previously interpreted discourse referent."]},{"title":"Coreference","paragraphs":["is determined by first eliminating from consideration those discourse referents to which an anaphoric expression"]},{"title":"cannot","paragraphs":["possibly refer, then selecting the optimal antecedent from the candidates that remain, where optimality is determined by a"]},{"title":"salience","paragraphs":["measure.","In order to present the details of anaphora resolution, we define below our notions--and implementations-- of coreference and salience. 2.2.1 Coreference As in the Lappin and Leass algorithm, the anaphor-antecedent relation is established between two discourse referents (cf. (Helm, 1982), (Kamp, 1981)), @hile the more general notion of coreference is represented in terms of equivalence classes of anaphorically related discourse referents, which we will refer to as \"COREF classes\". Thus, the problem of interpreting an anaphoric expression boils down to the problem of establishing an anaphoric link between the anaphor and some previously interpreted discourse referent (possibly another anaphor); a consequence of establishing"]},{"title":"114","paragraphs":["this link is that the anaphor becomes a member of the COREF class already associated with its antecedent.","In our implementation, COREF classes are represented as objects in the Common Lisp Object System which contain information about the COREF class as a whole, including canonical form (typically determined by the discourse referent which introduces the class), membership, and, most importantly, salience (discussed below). 1 The connection between a discourse referent and its COREF class is mediated through the COREF object as follows: every discourse referent includes an information parameter which is a pointer to a COREF object; discourse referents which have been determined to be coreferential share the same COREF value (and so literally point to the same object). Implementing coreference in this way provides a means of getting from any discourse referent in a COREF class to information about the class as a whole. 2.2.2"]},{"title":"Salience","paragraphs":["The information parameter of a COREF object most crucial to anaphora resolution is its salience, which is determined by the status of the members of the COREF class it re.presents with respect to 10 contextual, grammatical, and syntactic constraints. Following (Lappin and Leass, 1994), we will refer to these constraints as \"salience factors\". Individual salience factors are associated with numerical values; the overall salience, or \"salience weight\" of a COREF is the sum of the values of the salience factors that are satisfied by some member of the COREF class (note that values may be satisfied at most once by each member of the class). The salience factors used by our algorithm are defined below with their values. Our salience factors mirror those used by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), with the exception of Poss-s, discussed below, and CNTX-S, which is sensitive to the"]},{"title":"context","paragraphs":["in which a discourse referent appears, where a context is a topically coherent segment of text, as determined by a text-segmentation algorithm which follows (Hearst, 1994).

The relative ranking of the factors is justified both linguistically, as a reflection of the role of the functional hierarchy in determining anaphoric relations (cf. (Keenan and Comrie, 1977)), as well as by experimental results--both Lappin and Leass' and our own. For all factors except CNTX-S and POSS-S, we adopt the values derived from a series of experiments described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) which used different settings to determine the relative importance of","1The implementation of a COREF object needs to be aware of potenlial circularities, thus a COREF does not actually contain its member discourse referents, but rather a listing of their offsets, each factor as a function of the overall success of the algorithm. Our values for CNTX-S and POSS-S were determined using similar tests.","An important feature of our implementation of salience, following that of Lappin and Leass, is that it is variable: the salience of a COREF class decreases and increases according to the frequency of reference to the class. When an anaphoric link is established between a pronoun and a previously introduced discourse referent, the pronoun is added to the COREF class associated with the discourse referent, its COREF value is set to the COREF value of the antecedent (i.e., to the COREF object which represents the class), and the salience of the COREF object is recalculated according to how the new member satisfies the set of salience factors. This final step raises the overall salience of the COREF, since the new member will minimally satisfy SENT-S and CNTX-S.","Salience is not stable, however: in order to realistically represent the local prominence of discourse referents in a text, a decay function is built into the algorithm, so that salience weight decreases over time. If new members are not added, the salience weight of a COREF eventually reduces to zero. The consequence of this variability in salience is that a very general heuristic for anaphora resolution is established: resolve a pronoun to the most salient candidate antecedent."]},{"title":"2.2.3 Interpretation","paragraphs":["As noted above, in terms of overall strategy, the resolution procedure follows that of Lappin and Leass. The first step in interpreting the discourse referents in a new sentence is to decrease the salience weights of the COREF classes that have already been established by a factor of two. Next, the algorithm locates all non-anaphoric discourse referents in the sentence under consideration, generates a new COREF class for each one, and calculates its salience weight according to how the discourse referent satisfies the set of salience factors.","The second step involves the interpretation of lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals). A list of candidate antecedent-anaphor pairs is generated for every lexical anaphor, based on the hypothesis that a lexical anaphor must refer to a coargument. In the absence of configurational information, coarguments are identified using grammatical function information (as determined by LINGSOFT) and precedence relations. A reflexive can have one of three possible grammatical function values:"]},{"title":"direct object, indirect object,","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"oblique.","paragraphs":["In the first case, the closest preceding discourse referent with grammatical function value"]},{"title":"subject","paragraphs":["is identified as a possible antecedent. In the latter cases, both the closest preceding subject and the closest preceding direct object that is not separated from the anaphor by a subject are identified as possible antecedents. If more than one possible antecedent is located for a lexical anaphor, the one with the highest salience weight is determined to be the actual antecedent. Once an antecedent has been located, the anaphor is added to the COREF class associated with the antecedent, and the salience of the COREF class is recalculatec~ accordingly.","The final step is the interpretation of pronouns. The basic resolution heuristic, as noted above, is quite simple: generate a set of candidate antecedents, then establish coreference with the candidate which has the greatest salience weight (in the event of a tie, the closest candidateis chosen). In order to generate the candidate set, however, those discourse referents with which"]},{"title":"115","paragraphs":["a pronoun cannot refer must be eliminated from consideration. This is accomplished by running the overall candidate pool (the set of interpreted discourse referents whose salience values exceed an arbitrarily set threshold) through two sets of filters: a set of morphological agreement filters, which eliminate from consideration any discourse referent which disagrees in person, numbeb or gender with the pronoun, and a set of disjoint reference filters.","The determination of disjoint reference represents a significant point of divergence between our algorithm and the Lappin/Leass algorithm, because, as is well known, configurational relations play a prominent role in determining which constituents in a sentence a pronoun may refer to. Three conditions are of particular relevance to the anaphora resolution algorithm:","Condition ]: A pronoun cannot corefer with a coargument.","Condition 2: A pronoun cannot corefer with a nonpronominal constituent which it both commands and precedes.","Condition 3: A pronoun cannot corefer with a constituent which contains it. In the absence of configurafional information, our algorithm relies on inferences from grammatical function and precedence to determine disjoint reference. In practice, even without accurate information about constituent structure, the syntactic filters described below are extremely accurate (see the discussion of this point in section 4).","Condition i is implemented by locating all discourse referents with GFUN value direct object, indirect object, or oblique which follow a pronoun with GFUN value subject or direct object, as long as no subject intervenes (the hypothesis being that a subject indicates the beginning of the next clause). Discourse referents which satisfy these conditions are identified as disjoint.","Condition 2 is implemented by locating for every non-adjunct and non-embedded pronoun the set of non-pronominal discourse referents in its sentence which follow it, and eliminating these as potential antecedents. In effect, the command relation is inferred from precedence and the information provided by the syntactic patterns: an argument which is neither contained in an adjunct nor embedded in another nominal commands those expressions which it precedes.","Condition 3 makes use of the observation that a discourse referent contains every object to its right with a non-nil EMBED value. The algorithm identifies as disjoint a discourse referent and every pronoun which follows it and has a non-nil EMBED value, until a discourse referent with EMBED value NIL is located (marking the end of the containment domain). Condiditon 3 also rules out coreference between a genitive pronoun and the NP it modifies.","After the morphological and syntactic filters have been applied, the set of discourse referents that remain constitute the set of candidate antecedents for the pronoun. The candidate set is subjected to a final evaluation procedure which performs two functions: it decreases the salience of candidates which the pronoun precedes (cataphora is penalized), and it increases the sa l i ence of candida tes which satisfy either a locality or a parallelism condition (described below), both of which apply to intrasentential candidates.","The h)cality heuristic is designed to negate the effects of subordinationwhen both candidate and anaphor appear in the same subordinate context, the assumption being that the prominence of a candidate should be determined with respect to the position of the anaphor. This is a point of difference between our algorithm and the one described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994). The salience of a candidate which is determined to be in the same subordinate context as a pronoun (determined as a function of precedence relations and EMBED and ADJUNCT values) is temporarily increased to the level it would have were the candidate not in the subordinate context; the level is returned to normal after the anaphor is resolved.","The parallelism heuristic rewards candidates which are such that the pair consisting of the GFUN values of candidate and anaphor are identical to GFUN values of a previously identified anaphor-antecedent pair. This parallelism heuristic differs from a similar one used by the Lappin/Leass algorithm, which rewards candidates whose grammatical function is identical to that of an anaphor.","Once the generation and evaluation of the candidate set is complete, the candidates are ranked according to salience weight, and the candidate with the highest salience weight is determined to be the antecedent of the pronoun under consideration. In the event of a tie, the candidate which most immediately precedes the anaphor is selected as the antededent (where precedence is determined by comparing offset values). The COREF value of the pronoun is set to that of the antecedent, adding it to the the antecedent's COREF class, and the salience of the class is recalculated accordingly."]},{"title":"3 Example output","paragraphs":["The larger context from which the sample analysis in","the beginning of Section 2 was taken is as follows: \"...while Apple and its PowerPC partners claimed some prime real estate on the show floor, Apple's most interesting offerings debuted behind the scenes.

Their unification into a single class indicates both successful anaphora resolution (of the pronoun at offset 103), as well as the operation of higherqevel discourse processing designed to identify all references to a particular COREF class, not just the anaphoric ones (cf. (Kennedy and Boguraev, :1996)). The higher salience of the optimal candidate--which ix also a member of this COREF class--shows the effect of the locality heuristic described in section 2.2.3. Both the pronoun and the candidate appear in the same subordinate context (within a relative clause); as a result the salience of the candidate (but not of the class to which it bekmgs) is temporarily boosted to negate the effect of subordinatkm.","An abbreviated candidate set for the second italicized pronoun is given below:","ANA: its {61of f /145]","CND: company [(,)ot I / 142 ] :H,0","Appl e ((,!of 17/ 13 / ] 192","it:~:; {(aof I / I 3 ~ ] 192 This set is interesting because it illustrates the prominent role of SENT-S in controlling salience: company ix correctly identified as the antecedent of the pronotm, despite the frequency of mention of members of the COREF class containing Apple and its, because it occurs in the same sentence as the anaphor.

Within these texts, we counted 3(16 third person anaphoric pronouns; of these, 231l were correctly resolved to the discourse referent identified as the antecedent by the first author. 3 This rate of accuracy is clearly comparable to that of the Lappin/Leass algorithm, which (Lappin and Leass, ] 994) report as 85°/,,.","Several observations about the results and the comparison with (lmppin and I,eass, 1994) are in order. First, and most obviously, some deterioratkm in quality is to be expected, given the relatively impoverished linguistic base we start with.","Second, it is important to note that this is not just a matter of simple comparison.

While adaptations to the input format and interpretation procedures have necessarily addressed the issues of coping with a less rich level of linguistic analysis, there is only a small compromise in the quality of the results. Our evaluation indicates that the problems with the current implementation do not stem from the absence of a parse, but rather from factors which can be addressed within the constraints imposed by the shallow base analysis. The overall success of the algorithm is important, then, not only for the immediate utility of the particular modifications, but also because the strategy we have developed for circumventing the need for full syntactic analysis is applicable to other interpretation tasks which, like the problem of anaphora resolution, lie in the space of higher level semantic and discourse analysis."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Marti Hearst. 1994.
