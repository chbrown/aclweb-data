Many studies have been carried out on machine translation. The rule-based machine translation (John and Harold, 1992) could not deal adequately with various linguistic phenomena due to use only limited rules. To resolve this problem, example-based machine translations (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Akama and Ichikawa, 1979; Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Sumita et al., 1993) have recently been proposed. However, these methods require many translation examples to realize a practical and high quality translation.","The goal of our research is to design a computer system with the same capability of language and knowledge acquisition as human beings (Araki and Momouchi, 1994; Araki et al., 1995). In this paper, we propose a method of machine translation using inductive learning with genetic algorithms, The genetic algorithms (Goldberg, 1989) imitate tile evolutiona W process which repeats generational replacenmnt to adapt to the environment. The purposes are to establish various high quality translation rules from only a small amount of data, and produce high quality translation results. The system is expected to continuously evolve to higher learning and translation capability.","In this paper, we describe a method of machine translation using inductive learning with genetic algorithms, and show through the results of evaluation experiments that genetic algorithms are effective for the example-based machine translation."]},{"title":"2 Processes in the New Method","paragraphs":["2.1 Outline of tile Translation Method Figure 1 shows the outline of the new translation method. In this paper, we describe the process of English-Japanese translation as one possible application of this method. First, a user inputs a source sentence in English. Second, in the translation process, the system produces several candidates of translation results using translation rules extracted in the learning process. Third, the user proofreads the translated sentences. Fourth, in the feedback process, the system determines the fitness value and performs the selection process of translation rules.

There are two kinds of translation rules: those for sentences and those for words. The for-mer are called sentence translation rules and the latter word translation rules.

The system adds one to the con-cot translation fi'equency when the translation results have the same character strings as the proofl'ead translation results, and adds one to the erroneous translation frequency when the translation rules have different character strings to the proofread translation results. Second, the system determines the fitness value of the rules used in translation using these correct and erroneous translation frequencies. The fitness value is calculated by tile fitness fimction as follows:","t ,tness value(%) = The correct translation t'requcncy","The number of uses"]},{"title":"× 100 (1)","paragraphs":["Third, tile system performs tile selection process using the fitness value. The conditions of the selection process are that the nunlber of uses is over 5 and the fitness value is under 25%. These thresholds were determined by preliminary experiment. 2.4 Learning Process In this process, new translation examples are alttomatically produced by crossover and mutation. In crossover, two translation examples which have common parts are selected. C, rossover l)ositions are the conHlion parts~ and one-t)oiut crossovers for these two translation examples are performed. These one-poillt crossovers use each conllllOn part of tile English and Japanese sentences. Figure 3 shows examples of crossover. In Figure 3, \"likes\" is tile common part in the two English sentences, and \"wa\" and \"ga suki desu\" are the COmlnon parts in the two Japanese sentences. Therefore, \"likes\" and \"wa\" are the crossover positions. One-point crossovers are performed, producing two translation examples. Next, one-point crossovers are pertbrmed for \"likes\" and \"9a suki desu\". However, the translation examples which are produced have the same character strings as tile source sentences, and therefore, these translatio, examples are not inputted into tile dictionary. Translation exampies are randomly changed by nmtation, at a rai, e of 2%. New translatio, examples are also produced by replacing the words of translation examples with those of translation rules.","The system extracts the common and different parts fl'om the character strings of all translation examples.

This process also uses genetic algorithm. The details of this process are as follows:","1. Initial population","The system selects the translation rules which can be applied to the source sentence. The set of selected translation rules is called the initial population.","2. Determination of fitness value","The system calculates the fitness value of the translation rules by the fitness function (1).","3. Selection process","The method of the selection process was described in the section on feedback process.","4, Crossover","The method of crossover was described in the section on learning process.","5. Mutation","The method of mutation was described in the section on learning process.","6. Evaluation of population","The system substitutes the words in the word translation rules for the variables in the sentence translation rules. A translation rule includes a Japanese sentence or words corresponding to an English sentence or words. The system produces a Japanese sentence for the English sentence when the English sentence has the same character string as the source sentence. The Japanese sentence which is produced is the translation result, Figure 4 shows an example of how the translation result is produced.","The system selects the correct translation result according to two criteria when there are several candidates of translation results: one criterion is the translation rule which has a higher fitness value and the other is the translation rule which is more similar to the source sentence.","3 Experiments for Performance Evaluation 3.1 Method of Evaluation The effective translation results are grouped into two categories:","(1)The translation result has the same character string as the proofread translation result.","(2)The translation result has the same structure as the proofread translation result.","This means that the proofread translation result has the same character string as the translation result with substituted nouns or adjectives for the variables.","The ineffective translation results are grouped into three categories:","(3)The translation result has a different character string than the proofread translation result without unregistered words.","(4)The translation result has a different character string than the proofread translation result with unregistered words.","(5)A failed translation.","The system ranks ten candidates of translation results for the user. The method for determining optimal translation results was described in Subsection 2.5. 3.2 Method of Experiments In the experiments, 1,810 translation examples were used as data, of which 1,010 examples were taken from a textbook (Hasegawa et al., 1991) for first grade junior high school students, and 1022 'Fable 1: Results of expei'imeuts using genetic algorithms Rank ]---R-~ To-TT~ ~ 47.0% 61.9% Effective translation","(3) 14.7% Incffectivc translation (4) 17.1% 38.1% 800 examples fl'om another textbook (Ota et al., 1991) for first grade junior high school students in Japan. All of these translation examples were processed by the method outlined in Figure 1. First, 1,010 translation examples were used for the learning process, and 800 translation exanlples were used for evaluation of the translation. Experiments were carried out with and without genetic algorithms. In the experiments without genetic algorithms, crossover, mutation and the selection process were not performed. 3.3 Results of Experiments The accuracy rate of translation increased fronl 52.8% to 61.9% by applying genetic algorithms. Table 1 shows the results of experiments using genetic algorithms. In this table, (1) ~ (5) correspond to (1) ~ (5) in Subsection 3.1. Table 2 shows examples of translation results using genetic algorithms. 3.4 Discussion In the experiments without genetic algorithms, high quality translation results coukl not be obtained due to the requirement of a very large amount of translation examples which are similar to other translatiml examples. Therefore, we applied genetic algorithms to a method of machine translation using inductive learning to automatically produce ncw translation examples which are similar to other translation examples. By using genetic algorithms, the accuracy rate of translation increased from 52.8% to 61.9%. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a new method of machine translation using inductive learning with genetic algorithms. The results of evaluation experiments showed that the accuracy rate of translation increased from 52.8% to 61.9% by using genetic algorithms. Thus, we consider that this new mcthod can get the higher accuracy rate of translation and produce the higher quality translation results than that of other machine translations.
