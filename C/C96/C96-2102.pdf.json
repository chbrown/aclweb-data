Some work has been carried out concerning punctuation and parsing, but much of it seems to have been rather ad-hoc and performance-motivated. This paper describes the first step towards the construction of a theoretically-motivated account of punctuation. Parsed corpora are processed to extract punctuation patterns, which are then checked and generalised to a small set of General Punctuation Rules. Their usage is discussed, and suggestions are made for possible methods of including punctuation information in grammars. 1 Introduction Ititherto, the field of punctuation has been almost completely ignored within Natural Language Processing, with perhaps the single exception of the sentence-final full-stop (period). The reason for this non-treatment has been the lack of any coherent theory Of punctuation on which a computational treatment could be based. As a result, most contemporary systems simply strip out punctuation in input text, and do not put any marks into generated texts.","Intuitively, this s~ems very wrong, since punctuation is such an integral part of many written languages. If text in the real world (a newspaper, for example) were to appear without any punctuation marks, it would appear very stilted, ambiguous or infantile. Therefore it is likely that any computational system that ignores these extra textual cues will suffer a degradation in performance, or at the very least a great restriction in the class of linguistic data it is able to process.","Several studies have already shown the potential for using punctuation within NLP. Dale (1991) has shown the positive benefits of using punctuation ill the fields of discourse structure and semantics, suggesting that it can be used to indicate degrees of rhetorical balance and aggregation between juxtaposed elements, and also that in certain cases a punctuation mark can determine the rhetorical relations that hold between two elements.","In the field of syntax Jones (1994) has shown, through a comparison of the performance of a grammar that uses punctuation and one which does not, that for the more complex sentences of real language, parsing with a punctuated grammar yields around two orders of magnitude fewer parses than parsing with an nnpunctuated grammar, and that additionally the punctuated parses better reflect the linguistic structure of the sentences. Briscoe and Carroll (1995) extend this work to show the real contribution that usage of punctuation can make to the syntactic analysis of text. They also point out some fundamental problems of the approach adopted by Jones (1994).","If, based on the conclusions of these studies, we are to include punctuation in NLP systems it is necessary to have some theory upon which a treatment can be based. Thus far, the only account available is that of Nunberg (1990), which although it provides a useful basis for a theory is a little too vague to be used as the basis of' any implementation. In addition, the basic implementation of Nunberg's punctuation linguistics seems untenable, certainly on a computational level, since it stipulates that punctuation phenomena should be treated on a seperate level to the lexical words in the sentence"]},{"title":"(Jones,","paragraphs":["1994). It is also the case that Nunberg's treatment of punctuation is 604 too prescriptive to account for, or permit, some phenomena that occur in real language (Jones,"]},{"title":":1995).","paragraphs":["Therefore it is necessary to develop a new theory of punctuation, that is suitable for computational implementation. Work has already been carried out on the variety of punctuation marks and their interaction (Jones, :1995), showing that whilst tile set of symbols that we conventionally regard as punctuation (point punctuation, quotation and parenthetical symbols) account for the majority of punctuation in the written language (and therefore conld be implemented in a standardised way), there is another set of more unusual symbols, usually with a higher semantic content, which tend to be specific to the corpus in which they occur and therefore art; less suited to a standardised treatment. This study also shows that the average number of punctuation symbols to be expected in a sentence of English is four, thus reinforcing the argument for the inclusion of pnnctnation in language processing systems.","Tile next step towards the devek)pnmnt of a theory of punctuation is the study of the interaction of punctuation and the lexical items it separates, in particular the way that punctuation will integrate into grammars and syntax. The major problem of the ewduatory studies, (Dale (199l), Jones (1994), and to a far lesser: extent Briscoe & Carroll (1995)), was that their coverage and use of pun<:tuation was rather poor, being necessarily based on human intuitions and possible idiosyncrasies. What is needed therefore is a proper investigation into the syntactic roles that punctuation symbols can play, and a tbrmalisation of these into instructions for the inclusion of punctuation in N]+ grammars. 2 Data Collection The best data sources are parsed corpora. Using these ensures a wide range of language is covered; since they are hand-parsed or checked tile parse will be (nominally) correct; and since there are many parsers/editors no individual's intuitions or idiosyncrasies will dominate. The set of parsed corpora is sadly very small but still suI[icient to yield useflfl results.","The corpus chosen was the Dow Jones section of the Penn rlYeebank (size: 1.95 million words). The bracketings were analysed so that each 'node' that has a puuctu~ttion mark as its imme(liate daughter is reported, with its other daughters abbreviated to their categories, as in. (i)- (3). (1) [NP [NP the following] : ] ==~ [Ne = NP :] (2) [S [PP In Edinburgh] , [s ...] ==ee[s = m' , s] (3) [NP [NP Bob] , [NP ...) , ] ==4> [NP = NP , NP , ]","In this fashion each sentence was broken down into a set of such category-patterns, resulting in a set of different categoryq)atterns for each punctuation symbol. These sets were then processed by hand to extract the underlying rule patterns from the raw category-patterns since these will include instances of serial repetition (4) and lexical 'breakthrough' in cases where phrases are not marked in the original corpus (5). (4) [NP = NP, NP , NP , NP or NP] (5) [NP :-= each project , or activity pp]","These underlying rule-patterns represent all the ways that punctuation behaves in this corpus, and are good indicators of how the punctuation marks might behave in the rest of language. In the next sections we try to generalise these rule-patterns and discuss their possible implementation. 3 Experimental Results There were 12,700 unique category-patterns extracted fl:om the corpus for the live most common marks of point punctuation, ranging from 9,320 for tile comma to 425 for the dash.

It should also be noted that some incorrect category assignments were made at the earlier data analysis stages, which explains why several of the revised rules have non-phrasal-level left-most daughters. Here are some examples of the inappropriate rule patterns.","• S:NP:S -- inappropriate because the mother category should really be NP. Instances of this pattern in the corpus (7) are no different to instances of the similar rule with a NP mother and the pattern is more suited to a nominal interpretation.
