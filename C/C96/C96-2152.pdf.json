In this paper, wc ttropose another alternative, that is, circ,,.m.~cription (McCarthy, 1986: Lifschitz, 1985).

Our work of disambiguation by intcrt)retation ordering is originated from (Satoh, 1991) and in a more recent work, Kameymna (Kameyama, 1994) has indcp(mdently propos('.d usage of circumscription for interpretation of pronominal anaphora.","In this paper, we explore this direction further. In circumscription, we give a prefcrclme of der over logical interpretations and consid('.r the most 1)referable models. This representation naturally corrcst)onds with a disambiguation task sin(w. we can regard a logical interpr(~tation as a possible remling, and disaml)igua, tion as a, task to get the most prcf(wal)h; reading among possil)le readlags. Among variants of circumscription, prioritizcd circu.mscriptio'n, is suitable to ret)rcsent various strength of preference rules. In f)rioritized <fircumscril)tion, we can (livide preference rules into hiernrchy and this hierarchy giv(,,s a t)riority rela-tion ov(,.r pr(~f('.rences. Therefore, we directly represent rules in the hierarchy in prioritized circumsccil)tion.","We believe, that circumscritttion has the following allvantage, s in the (:ask of resolving ambiguity. • Since wc use a tirst-order predicate calculus for a basic language, we (:all rot)resent various kinds of inforln;ttion such as grammaticsfl rules and semantical rules in one Damework. • There is only one extra underlying mc(:hanism besides iufi'.rellC(', rules for the first-order predicate cah:ulus, that; is, introducing an order over h)gical interltretations.

This representation can t)e regar(led as all assignment of qualitative strength for 1)ref(~l'ell(;(~ rules all([ reduces a ])ur(letl of tel)- resenting a ttriority over preference rules gready. Moreover, this prioritization is general since we can repr(~sent a various kind of priority besides specilicity. • It is important to retain 1)ossible readings if we can not w.solve aml)iguity yet. In cir(:umscrip-Lion, we can consider multiple preferable models, not nec(;ssary the single pr@rable model. So, if ther(~ are yet multiple possible readings as a result of disambiguation, we can keep these possit)le readings as multiple i)retb.rat/le lnodels.","In this l)aper, we also dis(:uss an implenmnration by using hierarchical constraint logic programlning (HCLP) language sltch as (Borning ct al., 1989). HCLP language is similar to constraint h)gic progralnming bmguage except that we (;nil represent a constraint hierm:dly. Thus, there is a corrcst/on(lencc l/ctwecn a solution of an HCLP language and the most t)rcferablc models of prioritized circunmcription. Ill this patter, we use our HCLP language based on a l)oolean constraint solver to get tlJ(', most t)rcferal)lc models from t)ref - er(mce rules rot)resented as bo(/h,,mt constraints in tlt(', HC'L1 ) language.
