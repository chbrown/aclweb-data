Various researches on word sense disamil)ignation have recently been utilized in (:orlms-based apt)roache.s, reflecting the growth in the numlmr of machine readable texts. Unlike rule-basel1 ~l)l)roa('.hes, eortms-l)asext al)proa(:hes free us fl'om the task of generalizing observed 1)he-nt)Illena to l)roduce rnles for word sense, disaln- ])igmttion, e.g. subt:ittegorization rules. Cortms-based al)proaches are exet:ut(;(1 based on the in-tuitively t'easibh', assmnption that the higher the degree of similarity betwee, n the context of an ill-put word and tim context ill which tit(; word apl)cars in a sens(~' in a tort)us , the more plausible it becomes that the word is used in the same s(.~nse. Corpus-/)ased m(;thotls are. classified into two ap-1)rt)aches: examI)le-I)ased approaches (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Urmnoto, 1994) and statistic-based apl)roa(:hes (l~rown et al., 1991; 1)tLglm and Itai, 1!)94; Niwa and Nitta, 11994; Schiitze, 1992; Ym'owsky, 1995). We follow the examt)h>based apl)roach ill exl)laining its effe.etivity for verb sense disamibiguation in Japanese.","A representative example-based method for verb sense disambiguation was proposed by Kurohashi and Nagao (Kurohashi's inethod) (Kurohashi rand Nagao, 1994). Their method uses an 0,xamph; database, containing examples of collocations as in figure 1. Figure 1 shows a fragment of tim entry associated wittl the Japan(;se verb to'ru. As with most words, the ve, rb to'r\"¢t has multipie senses, examples of whit:h are \"to take/steal,\" \"to attain,\" \"to subst'ril)e\" and \"to reserve,\" The database gives one or more case frame(s) associated with tilt', verbs for each of their senses. In .Japanese, a coutI)lelnt;nt Of a verb, which is a constituent of the case frame of the verb, consists of a nonii phrase (case filler) followed by a case marker such ms ga (nominative) or o (accusative). The database has ~m example set of case fillers for each case. As shown in figure 1, examples of a comi)lement c.an be considered as an extensional description of the selectional restriction on it.","The task (:onside.red in this paper is %o interpret\" a verb in an input s('.ntcnt:e, i.e. to choose ()lit) sense from a set of candidate senses of the verb. Given an input sentence, Kurohashi's method interprets the verb in the input by computing semantic similarity between the input and exalnples. For this computation, Kurohashi's nmthod experimeIltally uses the Ja,panese word thesaurus Bunruigoihyo (National-Language R(> search Institute, 1964). As with Inost thesauruses, the length of the 1lath between two words in Bunr'uigoihyo is exl)e, eted tt) reflect the similarity be,- tween them.

Itowever, in the case of torn, since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization in a semantic sense, it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly interpret the verb sense based on tile similarity in the nominative. In contrast, since the ranges are diverse in the accusative, it would lm fe.asible. to rely more strongly on the similarity in the accusative. This argument can be illustrated as in figure 3, in which the symbols \"1\" and \"2\" de-note example case fillers of different case fraines respectively, and an input sentence includes two case fillers denoted by \"x\" and \"y.\" The figure shows the distribution of example case fillers tie-noted by those symbols in a semantic space, where the semantic similarity between two case fillers is represented by the physical distance between two symbols.
