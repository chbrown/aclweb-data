These are less concerned with wellformedness of the input but rather with output for other components in the overall system. Much of semantic descriptions are of this kind.","If a parser treats all constraints on a par, it cannot distinguish between the structure-building and the filtering constraints. Since unification-based formalisms are monotonic, large structures are built up and have to undergo all the steps of unification, copying, and undoing in the processor.

Parsing these lattices is much more complex than parsing written text.","The basic idea presented here is to distribute the labour of evaluating the constraints in the grammar on several processors (i.e., parsers).

The other component then works only with successflfl analysis results of the previous one. This means, that one parser is in control over the other, whereas the latter one is not directly exposed to the input. For reasons which will become obvious below, we will call the first of these parsers the SYN-parser, the second one controlled by the SYN-parser, the SEM-par'ser.","Another consideration to be taken into account; is that the analysis should be incremental and time synchronous. This implies that the SVN-parser should not send its results only when it is completely finished, thus forcing the SEM-parser to wait} Interactivity is another aspect we had to consider. Tile SF, M-parser must be able to report back to the SYN-parser at least when its hypotheses failed. This would not be possible when the SEM-parser has to wait till the SYN-parser is finished. This requirement also constrains the exchange of messages.","Incrementality and interactivity imply a steady exchange of messages between the parsers. An important consideration then is that the overhead for this communication should not outweigh the gains of distributed processing. This rules out that the parsers should communicate by exchanging their analysis results in terms of resulting feature structures, since it; would imply that on each communication event the parsers would have to analyze the structures to detect changes, whether a structure is part of other already known structures, etc. It is hard to see how this kind of communication can be interleaved with normal parsing activity in efficient ways.","In contrast to this, our approach allows to exploit tim fact that the grammars employed by the parsers are derived fl'om the same grammar and thereby \"similar\" in structure. This makes it possible to restrict the conmmnication between the parsers to intbrmation about what rules were successfiflly or nnsuccessfiflly applied.

The approach allows that the parsers never need to exchange analysis results in terms of structures as the parsers should always be able to reconstruct these if necessary. On the other hand, this reconstructibility poses constraints on how the codescriptive grammar can be split up in subgrammars.","The requirements of incrementality, interactivity and efficient communication show that, our approach does not ernulate the \"description by analysis\" methodology in syntax-semantics interfaces on the basis of codescriptive grmnmars. 3 The Parsers and the Protocol The SYN-parser and the SEM-parser are agendadriven chart parsers. For speech parsing, the nodes represent points of times and edges represent word hypotheses/paths in the word lattice.

Analogous to partial evaluation of definite clauses, we can partially evaluate annotated grammar rules, since they drive the derivation. Partial evaluation means here to substitute type symbols by their expanded definitions.","Because a grammar contains finitely many rules of the above form and because the daughters (the right hand side of the rule) are type symbols (and there are only finitely many of them), a great deal of this partial evaluation process can be performed otttine.
