Without applying word segmentation techniques to the inputted plain text, we generate n-gram data from it. We then count the occurrence of each string and sort them in alphabetical order. It is significant that the frequency of occurrence of strings de, creases when the window size of observation is extended. From the statistical point of view, a word is a string with a fixed pattern that is used repeatedly, meaning that it; shouht occur with a higher frequency than a string that is not a word. We observe the variation of frequency of the sorted n-gram data and extract the strings that experience a significant (:hange in frequency of oc(:urrence when their length is extended. We apply this occurrence test to both the right and left hand sides of all strings to ensure the accurate detection of both boundaries of the string.

However a surprisely large numbe, r of invMid strings were also extracted. Subsequent work, (Ikehara et al., 1995) has extended the sorted file to avoid repeating the counting of substrings contained in strings already counted. This meant the extraction of only the longest strings in the order of frequency of occurrence. The result of extraction was improved as a result, but the deterinination of longest strings is always made consecutively from left to right. If an erroneous string is extracte, d, its error directly propagates through the, rest of input. It is possible that a string with an invalid starting pattern will be extracted because a string too long in character length has been extracted previously.","In the following sections, we firstly describe the necessity for making this statistical ol)servad(m for extracting open comtlounds from Thai text corpora. Then, the methodology of data preparw tion and open compound extraction is explained, Finally, we discuss the result of an experiment on both large and small test corpora to investigate the effectiveness of our method."]},{"title":"2 Problem Description","paragraphs":["It is a non-trivial task to identify a word ill the text of a language which has no specific punctua-tion to mark word boundaries. Up to the present, lexicographers' efforts have been inhibited by in-sufficient corpora and limited computational facilities. Almost all lexicon knowledge bases have been created with reliance oll human intuition. ]]1 recent years, a large amount of text corpora haw', become available, and it is now becoming possible to conduct more rigorous experiments on text corpora. We address the following problems in such 1143 a way that they are able to be solved by the way of statistical' methods.","1. There is no good evidence to support the itemization of a word in a dictionary. In traditional dictionary making, lexicographers have had to rely on citations collected by human readers from limited text corpora. More rare words rather than common words are found even in standard dictionaries (Church and Hanks , 1990). This is the problem in making a lexical entry list in dictionary construction.","2. It is hard to decide where to segment a string into its component words. It is also hard to enumerate words from a text, though it is reported that the accuracy of recent word segmentation methods using a dictionary and heuristic methods is higher than 95% in case of Thai (Virach , 1993). The accuracy depends mostly on word entries in the dictionary, and the priority for selecting between candidate words when there is more than one solution for word segmentation. This is the problem in assigning priority information for selection.","3 Word Extraction from Text Corpora We used a window size of 4 to 32 for n-gram data accumulation. The value is arbitrary but this range has proven sufficient to avoid collecting illegible strings. 3.1 Algorithm Define that, ]a I is the number of clusters ~ in the string 'a', n(a) is the number of occurrences of the string ~&', &ud n(a+l) is the number of occurrences of the string 'a' with one additional cluster added.","As the length of a string increases the number of occurrences of that string will decrease.

Therefore, we have to include the direction to the string observation.","Further define that, +a is the right observation of the string 'a', and","-a is the left observation of the string 'a'. Then,","n(-t-a+l) is the number of occurrences of the string 'a' with one cluster added to its right, and","n(-a+l) is the number of occurrences of the string 'a' with one cluster added to its left.","Following the same reasoning as above, we will obtain,"]},{"title":"n(+a +","paragraphs":["1) < n(a),"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["(3)"]},{"title":"+ 1) < (4)","paragraphs":["A string 'a' is a rigid expression if it satisfies the following conditions,"]},{"title":"n(+a +","paragraphs":["1) << n(a),"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["(5) n(-a + 1) <<"]},{"title":"n(a).","paragraphs":["(6) 3.2 Data preparation Following are the steps for creating n-gram text data according to the fundamental features of Thai text corpora.

Tokenize the text at locations of spaces, tabs and newline characters.","2. Produce n-gram strings following Thai spelling rules. Only strings that have possible boundaries are generated, and their occurrence counted.

Very few illegible strings are extracted though the threshold of the difference value is set to be as low as 10 in Figure 3, and 4 in Figure 4. The suitable value of the threshold of difference varies with the size of text corpus file. To obtain more meaningful strings fl'om a large file, we have to set a relatively high threshold of extraction. One of the advantages of our method is that there is an inherent trade~off between the quantity and the quality of the extracted strings. In the case of Figure 3, to limit the amount of illegible strings to not exceed 15% of the total extracted strings, we set the threshold to 30. As a result, we obtained 154 words, 114 fixed expressions and only 46 illegible strings. Furthermore, we found that of the 154 words appearing in the text, there were 84 words that were not found in a standard Thai dictionary."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has shown an algorithm for data preparation and open compound extraction. The cornpetitive selection and unified selection of rightward and leftward sorted strings play an important role in improving accuracy of the extraction. In the experiment, we applied Thai spelling rules to restrict the search path for string counts. Some types of spelling irregularities can be excluded by this process. By adjusting the value of threshold, we can extract suitable entries for open compound registration regardless of the size of the input file. Furthermore, our method has ensured the extraction of new words from the text file of the language that has no explicit word boundary, such as Thai. References","Church, K. W. and Hanks, P. 1990.
