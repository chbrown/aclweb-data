The t)rocess of determinin9 the set of possible antecedents is governe, d by morphosyntactic, syntactic, semantic, and prag-Inatic restrictions. The same holds for preferences applie, d in the antecedent selection process: simple surface criteria are involved as well as more elaborate syntactic, semantic, or focusing heuristics. As a consequence, recent approaches to anaphor resolution apply a careflflly selected blend of constraints and preferences, thus constituting Inulti-strategy approaches in the sense of Carbonell and Brown (Carbonell and Brown, 1988).","There are, however, implementability limitations. At discourse level, determining the set of admissible antecedents requires a representation which is ordered according to pragmatic relations"]},{"title":"(Grosz and","paragraphs":["Sidner, 1986; Wehber, 1989). Although various theoretical frmneworks have been suggested, the recognition of these relations in the case of unrestricted discourse is still beyond the state-of the-art. Moreover, there arc cases ill which antecedent decisions can only be made on the grounds of domain knowledge and inferencing, and although there have been various attempts to integrate components of these kinds into anaphor resolution approaches, a satisfying solution l;o this problem is not available by now.","As a conseqllence, c/lrrent anaphor resolution implementations rely oil constraints and preference heuristics which employ information originating from morphosyntactic, syntactic, or shallow semmltic analysis (of. (Carter, 1987)). These approaches, however, perform remarkably well. An early case study revealed that a 'naive' algorithm for resolving nonre[texive pronouns, by relying merely on morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface criteria, yields correct results for more than 80 percent of pronoun occurrences, and that tile incorporation of selectional constraints resuits in a gain of another 3.5 percent of accuracy (Hobbs, 1978). These results have been confirmed by recent work (Lappin and Leass, 1994). The latter approach is based on a more elaborate, theoryoriented, declarative, forlnulation of the syntactic constraints, and handles reflexive pronouns too. It proved that the incorporation of statistically measured lexical preference patterns (a dynamic, domain specific suhstitute R)r the static encoding of sele('tional t)references) yields a gain of only 3 pe.r cent, and a sol(; application of lexical preference t)atterns resulted in a performance below 35 per cent. Hence, there is strong evidence that syntactic restrictions in combination with surface based and syntactic prefe, rence criteria play the central role in realistic approaches to anaphor resolution.","In this I)aper, an anaI)hor resolution algorithin is described which has t)een implemented as part of the KONTEXT text analysis system for the German language (Haenelt, 1994). The emphasis lies on the description of imt)lementation techniques for syntactic constraints. Section 2 works out strategies whi(:h are applied, focusing on the 937 theoretical background from which the syntactic constraints emerge. Section 3 describes how these strategies are coined into an algorithm for the resolution of reflexives, nonreflexive pronouns, and definite common nouns, thereby elucidating details which have to be taken into account in an adequate implenmntation. In section 4, a theoretical evaluation is performed, and application results are given. Section 5 points out that the structural constraints may depend on circumstances which are not a matter of syntax alone, but rather necessitate semantic and pragmatic infereneing. As a consequence, limitations concerning the implementability show up, and the scope of syntactic constraints proves to be restricted."]},{"title":"2 Constraints and Preferences 2.1 Morphosyntactic Agreement","paragraphs":["A quite strict constraint requires the pronoun to agree with its antecedent in person, number, and gender. In example 1","(1) The father visited his daughter.

On the other hand, examples (3a) * The barberi shaves himi.

Due to these definitions, the acceptability judgements for the data presented above are reproduced by binding principles A, B, and C. For each example, the subject demarcating the (local) binding category is just the ordinary subject of the subordinate clause. (One has to recall that, in phrase structure trees, the subject c-commands the content of the VP.) The notion of subject, however, is a more general one, applying also to some kinds of nominal phrase attributes, in particular certain variations of genitives and possessives: (,5) Peter listens to Sam'si story about himself.","2In this paper, the notion of anaphor is used more generally.

As can t)e demonstrated by fllrth(,'r e, xamples (e.g. changing from active, to passive voice or vice versa), retaining the semanti(: case role should outvote retaining the synta(:tic (:as(; role.

Whereas for NPs with possessive markers (of. example (10)) the matter tends to be clear, a common source of difficulties emerges from adjectivally used participles and from deverbative NPs. In the latter case, e.g. a genitival attribute may instantiate, depend-lug on the NP, either the subject (.qenitiwts subjectivus) or the object (.qenitiwts objectivus) (for German, cf. (Teubert, 1979)). As the following examl)les demonstrate, it iv insufficient to know merely about the existence of a h)cal domain. In general, it is necessary to determine the instantia= tion of its participants, but this, at least in certain <:ases, involves pragmatic inferencing. (lla) Pauli accepts the decision for himi.

(12b) Pauli rcviscs the decision for himselfi. The clue lies in the observation that a pragmatic restriction is governing the instantiation of the implicit local subject in exmnples (11), but not in examples (12). in (11@, duc to the obvious conclusioil that someone who accepts an action is not the conscious actor of it, .Paul is pragmati- (:ally ruled out as the local subject of the decision domain.

Straightforward approaches may fail in cases in which interdependencies between antecedent decisions arise. Based on this observation, an algorithm has been presented which, on the one hand, is interdependency-sensitive, but, on the other hand, avoids computational unfeasibility l)y following a strategy according to which the choices with the highest plausibility are considered first. For each decision, its dynamic compatibility with the earlier (more plausible) deci-. sions is verified. The practical behaviour of the algorithm fulfilled the expectations.","There are, however, limitations to the scope of syntactic constraints. It has been demonstrated that, in general, the construction of appropriate representations for binding domains may necessitate semantic or pragmatic inferencing.","A topic which should be subject of further re-search is the interdependency between parse tree construction and anaphor resolution. Up to now, it has been assumed tacitly that, at the time of binding constraint application, the surface structure representation is available. The construction of this representation involves disambiguation decisions (relative clause attachment, prepositional phrase attachment, and uncertainty of syntactic flmction), which, due to their structure determining effects, may interfere with the antecedent options of anaphor resolution (cf. (Stuckardt, 1996)). At current, the KONTEXT text analysis system employs a processing model according to which parsing is performed prior to anaphor resolution. Because of the interdependency between parsing and anaphor resolution, however, these two problem (:lasses should be handled at one stage of processing rather than sequentially."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Jaimc G.
