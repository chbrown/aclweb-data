However, numerous redundancy problems face LTAGs developers, as highlighted by Vijay-Shanker and Schabes (92).","We present a compact hierarchical organization of syntactic descriptions, that is linguistically motivated and a tool that automatically generates the tree families of an LTAG. The tool starts from the syntactic hierarchy and principles of well-formedness and carries out all the relevant combinations of linguistic phenomena."]},{"title":"1 Lexicalized TAGs","paragraphs":["Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is a formalism integrating lexicon and grammar (Joshi, 87; Schabes et al., 88). It has both linguistic advantages (e.g elegant handling of unbounded dependencies and idioms) and computational advantages, particularly due to lexicalization (Schabes et al., 88). Linguists have developed over the years sizeable LTAG grammars, especially for English (XTAG group, 95; Abeill6 et al., 90) and French (Abeill6, 91).","In this formalism, the lexical items are associated with the syntactic structures in which they can appear. The structures are lexicalized elementary trees, namely containing at least one lexical node at the frontier (called the anchor of the tree). The elementary tree describes the maximal projection of the anchor. So a verb-anchored tree has a sentential root. Features structures are associated with the trees, that are combined with substitution and adjunction. Adjunction allows the extended domain of locality of the formalism : all trees anchored by a predicate contains nodes for all its arguments.","Such a lexicalized formalism needs a practical organization. LTAGs consist of a morphological lexicon, a syntactic qexicon of lemmas and a set of tree schemata, i.e. trees in which the lexical anchor is missing. In the syntactic lexicon, lemmas select the tree schemata they can anchor. When the grammar is used for parsing for instance, the words of the sentence to be parsed are associated with the relevant tree schemata to form complete lexicalized trees.","Tile set of tree schemata forms the syntactic part of the grammar. The tree schemata selected by predicative items are grouped into families, and collectively selected. A tree family contains the different possible trees for a given canonical subcategorization (or predicate-argument structure). The arguments are numbered, starting at 0 for the canonical subject. Along with the \"canonical\" trees, a family contains the ones that would be transformationally related in a movement-base approach. These are first the trees where a \"redistribution\" of the syntactic function of the arguments has occurred, for instance the passive trees, or middle (for French) or dative shift (for English), leading to an \"actual subcategorization\" different from the canonical one. When such a redistribution occurs, the syntactic function of the arguments change (or the argument may not be realized anymore, as in the agentless passive). For instance, the subject of a passive tree is number l, and not 0 (figure 1). This is useful from a semantic point of view, in the case of selectional restrictions attached to the lexical items, or of a syntactic/semantic interface.","s s N0$ V0 N15 N15 Vm$ V0","P N0$","I","par","Figure 1. Declarative transitive tree and corresponding full","passive for French 1","And secondly, a family may contain the trees with extracted argument (or cliticized in French). There are different types of trees for extraction. ]n the English grammar for instance, there are trees for wh-questions and trees for relative clauses (that are adjoined to NPs). In the French grammar there are also separate trees for cleft sentences with gaps in the clause, while the corresponding it-clefts are handled as relative clauses in the English grammar.","Nr NO* S C V0 N15 I qui S N0$ Vr Cll~V0","Figure 2. Two trees of the strict transitive family for French : the relativized subject and the cliticized object.","1The French LTAG comprises trees with flat structure (no VP node); in the passive tree, the auxiliary is substituted; the same symbol N is used for nominal phrases and nouns, the difference being expressed with a feature <det> (Abeill6, 91). we do not show the feature equations for the sake of clarity. For the French grammar, the average number of equations per tree is 12. 194","So a family contains all the schemata for a given canonical subcategorization. Yet, in the syntactic lexicon, a particular lemma may select a family only partially. For instance a lemma might select the transitive family, ruling out the passive trees.","On the other hand, the features appearing in the tree schemata are common to every lemma selecting these trees. The idiosyncratic features (attached to the anchor or upper in the tree) are introduced in the syntactic lexicon."]},{"title":"2 Development and maintenance problems with LTAGs","paragraphs":["This extreme lexicalization entails that a sizeable I,TAG comprises hundreds of elementary trees (over 600 for the cited large grammars). And as highlighted by Vijay-Shanker and Schabes (92), information on syntactic structures and associated features equations is repeated in dozens of tree schemata (hundreds for subjecbverb agreement for instance).","This redundancy problem is present at all levels of grammar development. The writing of an I,TAG is a rather fastidious task; its extension and/or maintenance is very difficult, since maintaining the grammar means for instance adding an equation to hundreds of trees. Extending it means adding new tre, es along with their equations, and it can also entail the addition of new features in existing trees. Furthermore, the amount of work may grow exponentially with the size of the grammar, since all combinations of phenomena must be handled.","And finally, in addition to the practical problems of grammar writing, updating and storage, redundancy makes it hard to get a clear vision of the theoretical and practical choices on which the grammar is based."]},{"title":"3 Existing solutions","paragraphs":["A few solutions have been proposed for the problems described above. Solutions to the redundancy problem make use of two tools for lexicon representation : inheritance networks and lexical rules. Vijay-Shanker and Schabes (92) have first proposed a scheme for the efficient representation of LTAGs, more precisely of the tree schemata of an I.TAG. They have thought of a monotonous inheritance network to represent the elementary trees, using partial descriptions of trees (Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 92 and 94) (see section 4.1 for further detail). They also propose to use \"lexical and syntactic rules\" to derive new entries. The core hierarchy should represent the \"canonical trees\", and the rules derive the ones with redistribution of the functions of arguments (passive, dative shift...) and the ones with extracted argument","Becker (93; 95) also proposes a hybrid system with the same dichotomy : inheritance network for the dimension of canonical subcategorization frame and \"meta-rules\" for redistribution or extraction (or both). The language for expressing the meta-rules is very close to the elementary tree language, except that meta-rules use meta-variables standing for subtrees, lle proposes to integrate the meta-rules to the XTAG system which would lead to an efficient maintenance and extension tool.","(Evans et al., 95) have proposed to use I)ATR to represent in a compact and efficient way an I,TAG for English, using (default) inheritance (and thus full trees instead of partial descriptions) and lexical rules to link tree structures. They argue the advantage of using ah:eady existing software. But some information is not taken into account : the lexical rules do not update argument index. For instance the dative shift rule for English changes the second complement - the PP - into a NP, which is not semantically satisfying. The passive rules simply discards the first complement (representing the canonical direct objet), the other complements moving up. But then the relation between the active object and the passive subject is lost.","The three cited solutions give an efficient representation (without redundancy) of an f.TAG, but have in our opinion two major deficiencies.","First these solutions use inheritance networks and lexical rules in a purely technical way. They give no principle about the form of the hierarchy or the lexical rules 2, whereas we believe that addressing the practical problem of redundancy should give the opportunity of formalizing the well-formedness of elementary trees and of tree families.","And second, the"]},{"title":",wnerative","paragraphs":["aspect of these solutions is not developed. Certainly the lexical rules are proposed as a tool for generation of new schemata or new classes in a inheritance network. But the automatic triggering, ordering and bounding of the lexical rules is not discussed."]},{"title":"4 Proposed solution : efficient representation and semi-automatic generation","paragraphs":["We propose a system for the writing and/or the updating of an [,TAG. It comprises a principled and hierarchical representation of lexico-syntactic structures. Using this hierarchy and p,'inciples of well-formedness, the tool carries out all the relevant crossings of linguistic phenomena to generate the tree families.","This solution not only addresses the problem of redundancy but also gives a more principle~based representation of an LTAG. The implementation of the principles gives a real generative power to the tool. So in a sense, our work can relate to (Kasper et al., 95) that describes an algorithm to translate a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-['PSG) into an LTAG. The inheritance hierarchy of tlPSG and its principles are \"flattened\" into a lexicalized formalism such as [,TAG. The idea is to benefit from a principle-based formalism such as 1 IPSG and from computational properties of an I,TAG.","2Becker gives a linguistic principle for the bounding of his meta-rules, but he has no solution tor the application of this principle. 195"]},{"title":"4.1 Hierarchical representation of an LTAG","paragraphs":["4.1.1 Formal choices : a monotonic inheritance network, without meta-rules","Like the solutions described in section 3, our system uses a multiple inheritance network. Yet, it does not use meta-rules. Though they could be a further step of factorization, it seemed interesting to \"get the whole picture\" of the grammar within the hierarchy, and not only the base trees.","Further, we have chosen monotonic inheritance, especially as far as syntactic descriptions are concerned. Default inheritance does not seem to be justified to represent tree schemata, from the linguistic point of view. Default inheritance is often necessary to deal with exceptions. One may want to express generalizations despite a few more specific exceptions. Now the set of tree schemata we intend to describe hierarchically is empty of lexical idiosyncrasies, which are in the syntactic lexicon (cf. section 1). The set of tree schemata represents syntactic phenomena that are all productive enough to allow monotonicity. This resulting hierarchy will then be more transparent and will benefit from more declarativity.","Technically, monotonicity in syntactic descriptions is allowed by the use of partial descriptions of trees (Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 92; 94), as was proposed in (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 92) (see section 4.1.3). 4.1.2 General organization of the hierarchy","Section 1 briefly described the organization of an LTAG in families of trees. The rules for the organization of a family, its coherence and completeness, are flattened into the different trees. With the approach of an automatic generation of TAG trees, we have found necessary to explicit these rules, which are defined using the notions of argument and syntactic function.","Following a functional approach to subcategorization (see for instance Lexical Functional Grammar, (Bresnan, 82)), we clearly separate the \"redistributions\" of syntactic functions of the arguments from the different realizations of a given syntactic function (in canonical, extracted, cliticized.., position). We intend the term redistribution in a broad sense for manipulation of the number and functions of arguments. It includes cases of reduction of arguments (e.g. agentless passive), restructuration (dative-shift for English) or even augmentation of arguments (some causative constructions 3, introducing an agent whose function is subject). Redistribution is represented in our system by pairing arguments and functions, and not in terms of movement","So the proposed hierarchy of syntactic descriptions (for the family anchored by a verb) comprises the three following dimensions : 3We talk about some causative constructions analysed as","complex predicates with co-anchors in French as in' Jean a fait s'assoir les enfants. *Jean made sit ihe children.","(Jean made the children sit) dimension 1 : the canonical subcategorization h'ame This dimension defines the types of canonical subcategorization. Its classes contain information on the arguments of a predicate, their index, their possible categories and their canonical syntactic function. dimension 2 : the redistribution of syntactic functions This dimension defines the types of redistribution of functions (including the case of no redistribution at all). The association of a canonical subcategorization frame and a compatible redistribution gives an actual subcategorization, namely a list of argument-function pairs, that have to be locally realized. dimension 3 : the syntactic realizations of the functions It expresses the way the different syntactic functions are positioned at the phrase-structure level (in canonical position or in cliticized or extracted position). This last dimension is itself partitioned according to two parameters : the syntactic function and the syntactic construction. 4.1.3 Monotonic inheritance and partial descriptions of trees The hierarchy is a strict multiple inheritance network whose terminal classes represent the elementary trees of the LTAG. These terminal classes are not written by hand but automatically generated following principles of well-formedness, either technical or linguistic.","A partial description is a set of constraints that characterizes a set of trees. Adding information to the description reduces monotonically the set of satisfying trees. The partial descriptions of Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (94) 4 use three relations : left-of, parent and dominance (represented with a dashed line). A dominance link can be further specified as a path of length superior or equal to zero. These links are obviously useful to underspecify a relation between two nodes at a general level, that will be specified at an either lower or lateral level. Figure 3 shows a partial description representing a sentence with a nominal subject in canonical position, giving no other information about possible other complements. The link between the S and V nodes is underspecified, allowing either presence or absence of a cliticized complement on the verb. In the case of a clitic, the path between the S and V nodes can be specified with the description of figure 4. Then, if we have the information that the nodes labelled respectively S and V of figures 3 and 4 are the same, the conjunction of the two descriptions is equivalent to the description of figure 5.","4Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (92) have used the partial descriptions introduced in (Rogers & Vijay-Shanker, 92), but we have used the more recent version of (Rogers & Vijay-Shanker, 94). The difference between the two verskms lies principally in the definition of quasi-trees, first seen as partial models of trees and later as distinguished sets of constraints."]},{"title":"196","paragraphs":["S"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["S Vr","N VO CI VO Figure 3 Figure 4 s N Vr"]},{"title":"/\\","paragraphs":["CI VO Figure 5","In the hierarchy of syntactic descriptions we propose, the partial description associated with a class is the unification of the own description of the class with all inherited partial descriptions. As shown in the above example, the conjunctkm of two descriptions may require statements of identity of nodes. Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (94) foresee, in the case of an application to 'FAG, the systematic identity of lexical anchors. Further, Vijay-Shanker and Schabes (92) make also use of a particular function to state identity of argumental nodes. But this is not enough as one might need to state equality of any type of nodes (like the S nodes in the above example). To achieve this in our' system, one simply needs to \"name\" both nodes in the same way.","dimension 1 Callonifa[ StlbCat ffa[llC // \"\\\\ //f //>t... / \\ ... ! strict Iransitivc~ \\ / dimclmion 2","redistribution of syntactic ftulclions","personal fttll paSSIVe Remember we talk about descriptions of trees.

Equality of nodes can also be inferred, mainly using the fact that a tree node has only one direct parent node.","We trove added atomic features associated with each constant, such as category, index, quality (i.e. foot, anchor or substitution node), canonical syntactic function and actual syntactic function. These features belong to the meta-formalism of I~TAG hierarchical organization. We will call them meta-features (as opposed to the features attached to the nodes of the TAG trees). In the conjunction of two descriptions, the identification of two nodes known to be the same (either by inference or because they have the same constant) requires the unification of such meta-features.
