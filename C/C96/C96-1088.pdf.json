In Dynamic Semantics, the semantic structure of a discourse gives rise to constraints on the resolution of anaphoric expressions. Centering theory claims that a discourse always has a single topic, or center. Constraints on the resolution of anaphoric expressions arise, in part, from the ways in which the center can change in a discourse.

In this paper, I will implement a simplified version of the centering theory in a dynamic system, and of phenomena involving sloppy identity in ellipsis and \"paycheck pronouns\".","Since Montague, a major goal of semantics has been to describe a compositional method for converting a syntactic representation of a sentence into a logical representation of the sentence meaning, and dmn to evaluate that representation with respect to a given context. A primary insight of dynamic semantics is that sentences have a systematic relation to context in two ways: not only are they evaluated with respect to the current context, but they also systematically change that context. This insight has particular relevance ['or the apparent puzzle presented by sloppy identity and related phenomena. While anaphoric expressions are normally thought to be identical in meaning to dmir antecedents, they receive a different interpretation than their antecedents in these cases. Given the dynamic perspective, the puzzle evaporates: the anaphoric expression and its antecedent might represent exactly the same meaning, since meaninn is fundamentally a potential to be evaluated with respect to some context. What changes is tile context, in the discourse intervening between antecedent and anaphoric expression.","Consider the following example involving sloppy identity in VP ellipsis:","(1) Tom1 loves his1 cat.
