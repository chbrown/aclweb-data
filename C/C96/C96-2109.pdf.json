A DATR hierarchy is defined by means of path-value specifications. Inheritance of values permits appropriate generalizations to be captured and redundancy in the description of data to be avoided. A simple default mechanism provides for concise descriptions while allowing for particular exceptions to inherited information to be stated in a natural way.","Currently, DATR is the most widely-used lexical knowledge representation language in the natural language processing community. The formalism has been applied to a wide variety of problems, including inflectional and derivational morphology (Gazdar, 1992; Kilbury, 1992; Corbett and Fraser, 1993), lexical semantics (Kilgariff, 1993), morphonology (Cahill, 1993), prosody (Gibbon and Bleiching, 1991) and speech (Andry et al., 1992). In more recent work, DATR has been used to provide a concise, inheritance-based encoding of Lexiealized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Evans et al., 1995). There are around a dozen different implementations of DATR in existence and largescale DATR lexicons have been designed for use in a number of natural language processing applications (Cahill and Evans, 1990; Andry et al., 1992; Cahill, 1994). A comprehensive, informal introduction to DATR and its application to the design of natural language lexicons can tbund in (Evans and Gazdar, 1996).","The original publications on DATR sought to provide the language with (1) a formal theory of inference (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a) and (2) a model-theoretic semantics (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b). Unfortunately, the definitions set out in these papers are not general enough to cover all of the constructs available in the DATR language. In particular, they fail to provide a full and correct treatment of DATR's notion of 'global inheritance', or the widely-used 'evaluable path' construct. A denotational semantics for DATR that covers all of the major constructs has been presented in (Keller, 1995). However, it still remains to provide a suitably general, formal theory of inference for DATR, and it is this objective that is addressed in the present paper."]},{"title":"2 Syntax of DATR Theories","paragraphs":["Let NODE and ATOM be finite sets of symbols.

In this work, an at-tempt is made to set out a logic of DATR statemerits. Consider for eXaml)le the following rule of in%rence, adapted from (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a).","NI:['I--=N~:P'2, N~ : P'2 == ~ Ni : l'l ='-~'~ The prelnises are detinitional sentences which can be read: \"the value of path 1'~ at node Nj ix (inherited fl'om) the value of path P'2 at; N2\" and \"the vahle of path 1~,2 at, node N2 is el\", respectively. Given the premise, s, the rule lieenees the conclusion \"the value of path ['l at node Nj is (t\". Thus, the rule captures a logical relationship between DATR sentences. For a given DATR theory T, rules of this kind lllay /)e used to deduce additional sentences as theorems of ']-.","In contrast, the system of inR;renee described ill this pal)er characterizes a relationship between DATR expressions (i.e. sequences of descriptors) and the vahles they may be used to cOlnlmte. As an example, consider the following (simpliiied) rule of the operational semantics: if N1 : l'~ == 4) G T the, n Ni : Pt ~ rt The rule is applieatfle just in case the theory T contains a detinitional sentence N, : t~l - - eft. It states that if the sequence of value descril)tors (/) on the right of the sentence evaluates to (-->) the sequence of atoms tt, then it may be concluded that the node/1)ath pair NI : I~ also evaluates to a. Rules of this kind may be used to provide, an inductive detinition of an evaluation relation between DATR expresskms and their values.","Both approaches to inference in DATR aim to provide a system of deductioi~ that makes it possible to (teterlnine formally, for a given DATR theory 7~, what; follows fl'om the stateulellts in 7.

Intuitively, the required value is obtained by concatenating the values of the descriptors Dog : (root) and Noun : (surf}, yielding dog s.","We wish to provide an inductive definition of an evaluation relation (denoted ~) between sequences of DATR descriptors in DESC* and sequences of atoms (i.e. values) in ATOM*. We write to mean that the sequences of descriptors ¢ evaluates to the sequence of atoms a. With respect to the DATR/ theory above we should expect that Dog : (cat) ~ noun and that Dog : (root) Noun: (surf) ~ dog s, amongst other things.","The formal definition of ==v for DATRL is provided by just four rules of inference, as shown in figure 1. The rule for Values states simply that a sequence of atoms evaluates to itself. Another way of thinking about this is that atom sequences are basic, and thus cannot be evaluated further. The rule for Definitions was briefly discussed in the previous section. It permits inferences to be made about the values associated with node/path pairs, provided that the theory T contains the appropriate definitional sentences. The third rule deals with the evaluation of sequences of descriptors, by breaking them up into shorter sequences. Given that the values of the sequences ¢ and ¢ are known, then the value of ¢¢ can be obtained simply by concatenation. Note that this rule in-troduces some non-determinism, since in general there is more than one way to break up a sequence of value descriptors. However, whichever way the sequence is broken up, the result (i.e. value obtained) should be the same. The following proof serves to illustrate the use of the rules Val, Def and Seq. It establishes formally that the node/path pair Dog : (plur) does indeed evaluate to dog s given the DATRL theory above. dog==~dog Val s ~ s Val","Dcf","Dog: <root) :=~ dog Noun: <suiT) ~ s Def Seq Dog: <root) Noun: (surf) ==~ dog s"]},{"title":"Dcf","paragraphs":["Dog: (plur) ~ dog s The final rule of figure 1 deals with DATR's evaluable path construct. Consider a value descriptor of the form A: (B: 0). To determine the value of the descriptor it is first necessary to establish what path is specified by the path descriptor (B : 0)- This involves evaluating the descriptor B : 0 and then 'plugging in' the resultant value a to obtain the path (a). The required value is then obtained by evaluating A : (a). The rule for Evaluable Paths provides a general statement of this process: if a sequence of value descriptors ¢ evaluates to a and N: (a) evaluates to/3, then N: (¢) also evaluates to ~."]},{"title":"5 Global Inheritance","paragraphs":["DATR's local inheritance mechanism provides for a simple kind of data abstraction. Thus, in the DATRL theory above, information about the plural suffix is stated once and for all at the abstract Noun node. It is then available to any instance of Noun such as Dog via local inheritance. On the other hand, information about the formation of singular and plural forms of dog must still be located at the Dog node, even though the processes involved are entirely regular. To overcome this problem, DATR provides a second form of inheritance: global inheritance. This section provides an evaluation semantics for a default-free variant of DATR with both local and global inheritance (DATRG). A simple DATRG theory is shown below.","Noun: <cat) :: noun","<sum =="]},{"title":"<sing)","paragraphs":["=- \"<root)\" <pint) == \"(root)\" <surf)","Dog : (cat) == Noun <root) == dog (sing) == Noun (plur) == Noun","The new theory is equivalent to that given previously in the sense that it associates exactly the same values with node/path pairs. However, in the DATRa theory global inheritance is used to capture the relevant generalizations about the singular and plural forms of nouns in English. Thus, the sent~ence Noun : <sing) == \"<root)\" states that the singular form of any noun is identical to its root (whatever that may be). The sentence Noun: (plur) == \"(root)\" (surf) states that the plural is obtained by attaching the (plural) suffix to the root.","To understand the way in which global inheritance works, it is necessary to introduce DATR's 648 notion of global contea't. Suppose that we wish to determine the value of Dog : (sing) in the exalnt)le DATRc; theory. Initially, the global context will be the pair (Dog, sing), bS\"om tile theory, the value of Dog : (sing} is to be inherited (locally) fl'om Noun : (sing), which ill turn inherits its value (globally) from the quoted path \"(root)\". rio evaluate the quoted path, the global context is examined to find the current global node (this is Dog) and the vahle of \"(root)\" is then obtained by evaluating Dog : (root), which yields dog as required.","More generally, the global context is used to fill in the missing node (t/ath) when a quoted path (node) is encountered. In addition, as a side effect of evahlating a global inheritance descriptor the global context is updated. Thus, after encountering the quoted path \"(root}\" in the preced-ing example, tile global context is changed from (Dog, sing) to (Dog, root). That is, the path component of the context is set to tile new global path root.","Let T be a DATRa theory defined with respect to the set of nodes NODE and the set of atoms ATOM. The set (:ON'X' of (.qlobal) contexts of 7- is defined as the set of all pairs of the form (N, (t), for N G NODE and (.~ G ATOM*. Contexts are denoted t)y C.

These rules are shown in figure 2.","Consider for examt)le the Quoted Path rule. The premise states that N : (c~) evahmtes to fl in the glohal context (N, a).

The rules for Values, Sequences and Evaluable Paths require only slight modification as the path extension is simply passed through from premises to consequent.

This means/;hat when a global descriptor is encountered, any path extension present is treated 'globally' rather than 'locally'. The main change in the Definitions rule lies in the conditions under which it is applicable. The amended rule just captures the 'most specific sentence wins' default mechanism.

This fulfills one of the original objectives of the DATR programme, as set out in (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a; Evans and Gazdar, 1989b), to provide the language with an explMt theory of inference. The inference rules provides a clear picture of the way in which the different constructs of the language work, and should serve as a foundation for future investigations of the mathematical and computational properties of DATR. Although the rules abstract away from particular impleInentational details such as order of evaluation, they can be rea& ily understood in computational terms and may prove useful as a guide to the construction of practical DATR interpreters.
