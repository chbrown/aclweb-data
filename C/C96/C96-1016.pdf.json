While these measures have led to significant advances for knowledge-lean applications, they do not adequately motivate progress in computational semantics leading to the development of large-scale, general purpose NLP systems. In this article, we argue that depth of semantic representation is essential for covering a broad range of phenomena in the computational treatment of language and propose (lepth as an important additional dimension for measuring the semantic coverage of NLP systems. We propose an operationalization of this measure and show how to characterize an NLP system along the dimensions of size, corpus coverage, and depth. The proposed framework is illustrated using sever~fl prominent NLP systems. We hope the preliminary proposals made in this article will lead to prolonged debates in the field and will continue to be refined."]},{"title":"1 Measures of Size versus Measures of Depth","paragraphs":["Evaluation of current and potential performance of' an NLP system or method is of crucial importance to researchers, developers and users. Current performance of systems is directly measured using a variety of tests and techniques. Often, as in the case of machine translation or information extraction, an entire \"industry\" of evaluation gets developed (see, for example, ARPA MT Evaluation; MUC-4 ). Measuring the performance of an NLP method, approach or technique (and through it the promise of a system based on it) is more difficult, as judgments must be made about \"blame assigmnent\" and the impact of improving a variety of system components on the overall future performance. One of the widely accepted measures of potential performance improvement is the feasibility of scaling up the static knowledge sources of an NLP system its grammars, lexicons, worht knowledge bases and other sets of language descriptions (the reasoning being that the larger the system's grammars and lexicons, the greater percentage of input they would be able to match and, therefore, the better the performance of the systeml). As a result, a system would be considered very promising if its knowledge sources could be significantly scaled up at a reasonable expense. Natm'ally, the expense is lowest if acquisition is performed automatically. This consideration and the recent resurgence of corpus-based methods heighten the interest in the automation of knowledge acquisition, llowever, we believe that such acquisition should not 1)e judged solely by the utility of acquired knowledge for ~ particular application.","A preliminary to the sealability estimates is a judgment of the current coverage of a system's static knowledge sources. Unfortunately, judgments based purely on size ace often mislead-ing. While they may be sufficiently straightforward for less km)wledgeAntensive methods used in such applications as information extraction and retrieval, part of speech tagging, bilingual corpus alignment, and so on, the saute is not true about more rule- and knowledge-based methods (such as syntactic parsers, semantic analyzers, semantic lexicons, ontological world models, etc.). It ix widely accepted, for instance, that judgments of the coverage of a syntactic grammar in terms of the number of rules are tlawed. It is somewhat less self-evident, however, that the number of lexicon entries or ontology concepts is not an adequate measure of the quality or coverage of NLP","a Incidentally, this consideration eontributes to evMuation of current perforntance as well. In the absence of actual evaluation results, it is customary to c|aim the utility of the system by simply mention-ing tit(: size of its knowledge sources (e.g., \"over 550 grammar rules, over 50,000 concepts in the ontology and over 100,00(I word senses in the dictionary\"). 33 systems. A.n adequate measure of these must examine not only size and its scalability, but also depth of knowledge along with its scalability. In addition, these size and depth measures cannot be generalized over the whole system, but must be directly associated with individual areas that cover the breadth of NLP problems (i.e. morphology, word-sense ambiguity, semantic dependency, coreference, discourse, semantic inference, etc.). And finally, the most helpfld measurements will not judge the system solely as it stands, but must in some way reflect the ultimate potential of the system, along with a quantification of how far additional work aimed at size and depth will bring about advancement toward that potential.","In this article, we attempt to formulate measures of coverage important to the development and evaluation of semantic systems. We proceed h'om the assumption that coverage is a function of not only the number of elements in (i.e., size of) a static knowledge source but also of the amount of information (i.e., depth) and the types of information (i.e., breadth) contained in each such element. Static size is often emphasized in evaluations with no attention paid to the often very in-significant amount of information associated with each of the many \"labels\" or primitive symbols. We snggest a starting framework for measuring size together with other significant dimensions of semantic coverage. In particular, the evaluation measures we propose reflect the necessary contribution of the depth and breadth of semantic descriptions. Depth and breadth of semantic description are essential for progress in computational semantics and, ultimately, for building large-scale, general purpose NLP systems. Of course, for a number of applications a very limited semantic analysis (e.g., in terms of, say, a dozen separate features) may be adequate for sufficiently high performance. However, in the long run, progress towards the ultimate goal of NLP is not possible without depth and breadth in semantic description and analysis.","There is a well-known belief that it is not appropriate to measure success of NLP using field-internal criteria. Its adherents maintain that NLP should be evaluated exclusively through evaluating its applications: information retrieval, machine translation, robotic planning, humancomputer interaction, etc. (see, for: example, the Proc. of the Active NLP Workshop; ARPA MT Evaluation). This may be true for NLP users, but developers must have internal measures of success. This is because it is very difficult to assign blame for the success or failure of an application on specific components of an NLP system. For example, in reporting on the MUC-3 evaluation efforts, Lehnert and Sundheim (1991) write: A wide range of language processing strategies was employed by the topscoring systems, indicating that many natnral language-processing techniques provide a viable foundation for sophisticated text analysis. Further evaluation is needed to produce a more detailed as-sessment of the relative merits of specific technologies and establish true performance limits tbr automated information extraction. [emphasis added.]"]},{"title":"Thus,","paragraphs":["evaluating the information extraction application did not provide constructive criticism on particular NLP techniques to enable advances in the state of the art. Also, evaluating an application does not directly contribute to progress in NLP as such. This is in part because a majority of current and exploratory NLP systems are not complete enough to fit an application but rather are devoted to one or more of a variety of components of a comprehensive NLP system (static e.g., lexicons, grammars, etc.; or dynamic e.g., an algorithm for\" treating metonymy in English). 1.1 Current Measures of Coverage Success in NLP (including semantic analysis and related areas) is currently measured by the following criteria:","• Size of static knowledge sources: A mere nmnber indicating the size of a knowledge source does not tell us much about the coverage of the system, let alone its semantic capabilities. For example, most machine readable dictionaries (MRI)) are larger than computational lexicons but they are not usable for: computational semantics.","• Coverage of corpus, either blanket cover:- age (\"56% of sentences were translated correctly\") or resolution of a certain phenomenon (\" 78% of anaphors were determined correctly\"). These measures are ofl;en misleading by themselves since what may be covered are just one or two highly specific phenomena such as recognizing place or product names (i.e., limited breadth). NLP is not yet at a stage where \"covering a corpus\" can mean \"analyzing all elenmnts of meanings of texts in the corpus.\" It may be noted that \"correctly\" is a problematic term since people often have difficulty judging what is \"correct\" (Will, 1993). Moreover, correctness is orthogonal to the entire discussion here since we would like to increase semantic coverage along various dimensions while maintaining an acceptable degree of correctness. On the same lines, processing efficiency (often specified in terms such as \"A sentence of length 9 takes 750 milliseconds to process\") is also more or less orthogonal to the dimensions we propose for measuring semantic coverage.

Figure 1 also shows the desired state of computational semantics advmlced alor|g each of the three dimensions shown. If","We proceed from the assumption that high-quality NLI ) systems require optimum coverage on all three scales, the|| apparently different roads (-an be taken to that target. The speetrmn of choices ranges from developing all three dimensions more or less simultaneously to taking care of them in turn. As is often the case in kingterm high-risk enterprises, inany researchers opt to start out with acquisition work which promises short-term gains on one of the coverage dimensions, with little thought about further steps. Of_ ten the reason they cite can be summarized by the phrase \"Science is the art of the possible.\" This position is quite defensihle .... if no claims are made about broad semantic (:overage. Indeed, it is quite legitimate to study a particular language phenomenon exclusively or to cover large chunks of the lexis of a language in a shallow manner. IIowever, for practical gains in large-scale computational-selnantie applications one needs to achieve results on each of the three dimensions of coverage.","1.2 Desiderata for Large-Scale Colnputational Semantics Once the initial knowledge acquisition canq)aign for a I)articular apt)lication has been concluded, the following crucial scalability issues 2 ira|st be addressed, if any t|nderstanding of the longer-term significance of the research is sought:","• domain independence: scalability to new (lomains; general-purpose Nl,l )","• language independence: sealability across languages","• phenolnenon coverage: sealability to new phenomena; going beyond core semantic analysis; ease of integrating component proeesses and resources.","• application-independence: sealability to new applications; toolkit o[' NLP techniques applicable to any t~sk.","We believe that coverage in terms of the det)th and breadth of the knowledge given to an NLI ) system is mandatory for attaining the above goals in the long run. Such coverage is best esti(nated not in terms of raw sizes of lexicons or world models but rather through the availability in them of information necessary for the treatment of a w> riety of l)henomena in natural language issues related to semantic dependency bull(ling, lexical disambiguation, semantic constraint tracking and relaxation (for the cases of unexpected input, including non-li~eral language as well as treatment of unknown lexis), reference, pragmatic impact and discourse structure. The resolution of these issues is at the core of t)ost-syntactic text processing. We believe that one can treat the al)ove phenomena only by acquiring a broad range of relevant knowledge elements for the system. One nseflfl measure for sufficiency of infbrmation would be an analysis of kinds of knowledge necessary to generate a text (or (liMog) meaning representation. For applications in which more procedural computational semantics is l)refl~'rable, a correspond ing measure of sutliciency should be developed.","There exist other, broader desiderata which are applicable to any All systetn. They include concerns about system robustness, correctness, and efficiency which are orthogonal to the above issues. EquMly important but more broadly applicable are considerations of economy and ease of acquisition of knowledge sources for example, reducing the size of knowledge bases and sharing knowledge across applications.","2At present, se~dability is considered in the field ahnost exclusively ~ts propagation o[ the nulnber of entries in the NLP knowledge bases, not the quantity and quality of information inside each such entry. 85","2 How to Reason about Depth, Breadth and Size A useful measure of semantic coverage must in-volve measurement along each of the three dimensions with respect to correctness (or success rate) and efficiency (or speed). In this first attempt at a qualitative metric, we list questions relevant for assigning qualitative (\"tendency\") scores to an NLP system to measure its semantic coverage. Our experience over the years has led us to the following sets of criteria for measuring semantic coverage. Itowever, we understand that the following are not complete or unique; they are representative of the types of issues that are relevant to measuring semantic coverage.","2.1 Lexical Coverage","• 'lb what extent do entries share semantic primitives (or concepts) to represent word meanings? What is the relation between the number of semantic primitives defined and the number of word senses covered?","• What is the size of the semantic zones of the entry? tlow many semantic features are covered?","• How many word senses from standard human-oriented dictionaries are covered in the NLP-oriented lexicon entry?","• What types of information are included?","- seleetional restrictions","- constraint relaxation information","syntax-semantics linking","- collocations","- procedural attachments for contextual","processing","-- stylistic parameters","- aspectual, temporal, modal and attitu-","dinal meanings","-other idiosyncratic information about","the word","• and, finally, the total number of entries in the lexicon. 2.2 Ontological Coverage The total number of primitive labels in a world model is not a useful measure of the semantic coverage of a system. At least the following considerations must be factored in: • The number of properties and links defined for an individual concept • Number of types of non-taxonomic relationships among concepts • Average number of links per concept: \"connectivity\" • Types of knowledge included: defaults, selectional constraints, complex events, etc.","• Ratio of number of entries in a lexicon to number of concepts in the ontology","• and, finally, total number of concepts in the ontology.","2.3 Measuring Breadth of Meaning Representations Apart from lexical and ontological coverage, the depth and breadth of the meaning representations constructed by a system are good indicators of the overall semantic coverage of the system. Tile number of different types of meaning elements in-cluded fl'om the following set provides a reasonable measure of coverage: • Argument structure only • Template filling only • Events and participants • Thematic role assignments • Time and temporal relations • Aspect","• Properties: attributes of events and objects; relations between events and objects. • R,eference and coreference • Attitude, modality, stylistics","• Quantitative, comparative, and other mathematical relations","* Textual relations and other discourse relations • Multiple ambiguous interpretations * Propositional and story/dialog structure","3 Measuring Semantic Coverage: Examples","Figure 2 shows the approximate position of several well-known approaches and systems (including a possible Cyc-based system) in the 3dimensional space of semantic coverage. We have chosen representative systems fl'om the different approaches for lack of precise terms to name tlle approaches.","How do the approaches illustrated in Figure 2 rate with respect to the metrics suggested above'? When estimating their profiles, we thought either about some representative systems belonging to an approach or thought of the properties of a prototypical system in a particular paradigm if no examples presented themselves readily. In the in-terests of space, we consider the above criteria for measuring semantic coverage but only provide brief summaries of how each system or approach is located along the dimensions of depth, breadth and size.","The schema-based reasoner, Boris (behnert et al, 1983) was used as a prototype system for the 8g"]},{"title":"+ +++++++++{ !!}: i + :-+:::+ ::+.","paragraphs":["++++++5++ i+~i++++++","+ ++++++++5+i+i+?+++++++++++5+++++i+++ +++5+i+ ++i +++ ++++++++++i~ + + +ii+i{5++++++51+5~+++++++ ~!:+:: :, +77:+}+ }+++ ++",".................................................... ~'ii ......................... , .......................................................

Significant scale-up can be accomplished under such a constraint without jeopardizing the high values on the depth and breadth scales.","Size is important in NLP. But size alone is not a sufficient metric for evaluating semantic coverage. Focusing on size to the exclusion of other criteria has biased the field away from semantic solutions to NLP problems. We have made a first step in formulating a more appropriate and complete set of measures of semantic coverage. Depth and breadth of knowledge necessary to cover a wide range language phenomena are at least as important to NLP as size. The discussion of peculiarities of the various approaches should be expanded in at least two directions - greater detail of description and analysis of the relative ditficulty of reaching the set goal of attaining an optimum value on each of the three measurement scales.
