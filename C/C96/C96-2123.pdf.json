In Generalized Phrase Strcuture Gram-","mar ((~VS(~) (Gazd~u\" ctal., 1985), these lin-","ear order constraints are stated explicitly in","the gralIllnar. The notion of structured com-","plexity provides an explanatory account.","'l'here are several reasons why the notion of strHCtltl:a] COml)lexity ix tlseful. Firstly, in natural language generation, a generator should get> era.re the simphest sentence that conveys the in-tended meanings. Structural complexity can be used to choose l;he syntactic strnctures with l;he lowest structural complexity so that the resulting sentence is easier to understand than other alternatives.","Secondly, structural complexity is also needed in assessing the readability of dommtents. [t is well known that the length of a sentence is not, a relit~ble indicator of its readability. Yet, the readability of texts has up to now heen measured by tlJe lengths of sentences and familiarities of th(: words in the documents. Using structural complexity instead of sentence length allows the read- ~fl)ility of documents to be measured tnorc accurately.","Finally, we propose, in Section 4, that extrapositions ~re rnotiw~ted by reduction of structural 729 complexity. In other words, extrapositions are only allowed if the structural complexity of tile sentence is reduced as a result. This constraint is nsefnl both in parsing sentences with extrapositions and in deciding where to use extraposition during generation.","The notion of structural complexity is defined in Section 2. We then justify the definition of structural complexity by demonstrating in Sections 3, 4, and 5 that sentences with lower structural complexity are easier to understand than otherwise similar sentences with higher structural complexity."]},{"title":"2 Structural Complexity","paragraphs":["The definition of structural complexity presumes the notion of dependency relationships between words in a sentence. In dependency grammars (Hudson, 1984; Mel'Suk, 1987), a dependency relationship is a primitive relationship between two words, called the head and the modifier. In constituency grammars that contain the X-bar theory as a component, dependency relationships between words are implicitly specified in X-bar structures. The modifiers of a word w are the head words of the specifier, complements, and adjuncts of w. For example, Figure 1 is the X-bar structure of (2). The word \"will\" has two modifiers: the head word ()fits NP specifier (\"Kinf') and the head word of its VP complement (\"bring\"). The dependency relationships in tim X-bar structure in l!'igure 1 are shown in Figure 2. Each directed link in Fignre 2 represents a dependency relationship with the direction going from the head to the modifier.

Structural complexity measures how easy or di[[icnlt it is to establish these dependency links. The definition of structural complexity is based on the assumption that the shorter dependency links are easier to es-- tablish than longer ones, where the length of a dependency link is one plns the nmnber of words between the head and the moditier. I:or e.xample, the lengths of tile links in Figure 2 are shown by the numbers attached to the dependency links. Definition 2.1 (Struetural Complexity) The slructural complexity of a dependency struclure is the total length of the dependency links in the structure. For example the structural complexity of the dependency structure in Figure 2 is 11.","[n the next three sections, we will show that the definition of structural comph'.xity does i,- deed retlect the difficulty in processing a sentence. We will present examples in which sentences with lower structural complexities are easier to process than similar sentences with higher structural comph;xities. 3 Center embedding The difficulty in processing center embedding senten('es: such as (13), hgs been explained by its requirement on the size of tile stack in a parsb, r. This explanation presumes that the human parser uses a push-down stack to store the partially built constituents. 'l'he notion of structural complexity provides an explanation of the difficulty of processing center embedding that makes much weaker commitment to the parsing model. Figure 3 shows the lengths of the dependency links in a center-embedding sentence (la) and a non-center-embedding sentence (lb) with similar semantics. The structural complexity of the center-embedding sentence is 30, which is much higher than the structurM complexity (=112) of the non-center-embedding sentence.","The presumption that human sentence processor uses a push-down sl;ack is challenged by the contrast between cross-serial dependencies in Dutch (e.g., Figure 4a) and center-embedding sentences in German (e.g., Figm:e 4b.)","Since the cross serial dependencies are much more ditficnlt to handle with push-down stacks 730 n;"]},{"title":"I\" F7 Lr ill 1~1 r-?l?-I u] The cat that the dog that the man bought chased died The man bought the dog that chased the cat that died","paragraphs":["Figure 3: (]ent,er-l,]lnlmdding vs. Not-(,elt.e.l- (hire th;m their English couvd,erpm'l;s\" (p. 249).
