In the ideal case, lexical entries fulfill, among others, two requirements. First, the representations are suitably fine grained such that they capture lexeme-speeific distinctions. Second, the lexical entries are sufficiently general, for reflecting similarities between single lexemes. Furthermore, the information they contain should systematically link various levels of description, e.g. syntax and semantics as well as referential and inferential potential. The latter is of special interest for text analysis as opposed to sentence analysis (eft for example (Haenelt, 1994); (Haenelt and KSnyves-Tdth, 1991)).","Corresponding to these requirements, we exploit the specific strengths of two distinct semantic theories. These theories are Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) ((Kamp and Reyle, 1993); (FraCaS-DS, 1994)) and Semantic Emphasis Theory (SET)((Kunze, 1991); (Kunze, 1993)). However, our central goal is an integration of D113' and SET. It will be shown that this integration is possible and of benefit to both theories as well as to the construction of lexical entries. To achieve our overall objective, the following four points will be exemplified by joined representations of German verbs:","• DRT profits from SET's systematic derivations of thematic roles and of morpho-syntaetic features on the basis of predicate-argument-structures. These features include both grammatical and prepositional case.","• DRT gains a purely semantically motivated orientation towards lexical fields.","• Dll[l' covers much more semantic phenomena than SET. Therefore, DI{T offers SET the possibility to test its results against a semantic background that e.g. includes plurals, tenses, and attitudes.","• DRT's fine grained lexical analyses are grounded in inferential behaviour. These lexical distinctions mark possible starting points for refining SET's representations.","The paper is structured as follows: DRT's and SET's basic motivations, principles and formal means concerning lexical semantics are retraced ~n sections 2 and 3. The new joined representation format is introduced in section 4 by analysing the German verbs leihen (in its variant to lend) and verschenken (in its variant to give as a present). Moreover, section 4 provides evidence that the four main points stated above are backed up by the joined analyses. Finally, directions for further research are pointed out in section 5."]},{"title":"2 DRT -- Inferentially Motivated","paragraphs":["Discourse RepT~sentation Theory (DRT) is first and foremost a theory about discourse interpretation, i.e., it is essentially textually oriented in natm'e.

The link is based on a set of well-defined and systematically occurring mappings (cf. (Firzlaff and Kunze, 1995)) rather than on intuitive criteria. Given a basic semantic form (BSF) as a cornmon starting point, we derive semantic and syntactic case frames and construct prototypical meaning descriptions of concrete lexemes by refining the BSF. Additionally, the rule based interpretation of a BSF delivers a prototypical description of the corresponding situation.","The set of lexemes that are suitable to refer to the same situation constitutes a lexical field. The field as a whole is characterized by a BSF. A BSF is a propositional description. It consists of a predicate and a nmnber of arguments, each of which is either a predicate-argument structure or an elementary argunlent. In general, elementary arguments are represented by variables that have to be filled in by phrases which denote reference objects (participants of a situation).","The number of arguinents, as well as the decision whether the arguments are elementary or propositional, both depend on tim predicate that, directly takes these arguments. We derive the participants' ttminatic roles (deep cases) in accof dance with a set of general rules. Semant;ically, each pair of a role and the predicate directly dominating an elementary argument demands particular selectional features for that argument. The BSF describing the field of change-of-possession (with one object to be transihrred) and the derived deep cases are given in Figure 3.

BSF and deel) cases.","From both the syntactic and the semantic point of view, the BSF delivers the maximum case frame of the lexemes that constitute the lexical field. Some of the roles of the maximum case frame can be put into the foreground; these are said to have cmphasis. Some roles nmst not be verbalized explicitly; these are said to be blocked. In the subset of roles that are not blocked there are, on the one hand, roles referring to obligatory actants and, on the other hand, roles referring to optional actants. Which roles have emphasis and which do not have emphasis, which are the ones that must be verbalized, and which are the ones that need not be verbalized is determined according to general rules. Exploiting the field specific possibilities to make some variables denote the same reference object (by renaming of variables) results in more specific BSFs. These then describe partial lexical fields like, e.g. to give or to take.","By adding infbrmation about, emphasis and blocking of roles, a BSF is transformed into a number\" of prototypieal meaning descriptions. We can then derive systematically which are the suitable grammatical realizations of each role. However, there are two important points concerning the determination of which grammatical realizations are possible: Firstly, the predicate that takes the corresponding elementary argument directly and, secondly, the choice of that subset of roles of tim maximum case frame that are not blocked.

They are also suitable to derive prototypieal situation descriptions. In order to do so, instantiation rules must be applied to a BSF in a recursive way. The application of instantiation ruh;s has to be regarded as an interpretation of every partial description in a BSF. Some of these parts are, then represented by variables that have to be filled in by objects referring to states or (;vents, and other parts deliver relationships between these states or events. In addition, some of the instantiation rules provide temt)oral and/or spatial constraints that are applicable to (tim corresponding parts of) a prototypical situation description, e.g., etimc is a mapping fl'om the set of events or states to the set of temporal entities (etime: g -+ T).","In general, tile instantiation rules provide struc-","1Generally, this grammatical case assignment is suitable for about 20 verbs of the partial field to give.","2More precisely, there is a mapping front the set of variables into the set of nominal phrases (more generally, parts of speech) f: V --+ b r. 384","CAUSE (ACT(p) ET","(BEC (N()T(nAVE(p,.)))
