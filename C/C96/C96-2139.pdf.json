Storing information on a large number of sentences requires a relatively large memory space, which has become available as a result of progress in hardware technology. Our fl'amework is highly practical, since it does not require any knowledge resources that have been specially hand-coded for context processing, or a deep inference mechanism, yet it improves the accuracy of sentence analysis and the quality of a practical NLP system.
