Such unidire(:tional events are beneficial to the (leterntinism of search since they restrict the number of arcs that can be traversed from any node. Controls represent a fltrther imln'Ovement on distributedness since they reduce the number of reqnired event nodes without Mfecting richness. The in~ formation expressed as controls is never re l~rred to by other events.","Controls allow defaulting, which is illegal for the network, l)efaulting consists of assulning some fact, when no information of that fact's type is e.xpressed explicitly.
