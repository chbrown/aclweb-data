Case frame approach has been the representation of choice especially for languages with free constituent order, explicit case marking of noun phrases and embedded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles. The semantics of such syntactic role fillers are usually determined by their lexicM, semantic and morplmsyntactic properties, instead of position in the sentence. In this paper, we present an approach to building a constraint-based case Dame lexicon for use in natural language processing in Turkish.","A number of observations tha.t we have made on Turkish tmve indicated that we have to go beyond the traditional transitive and intransitive distinction, and utilize a Damework where verb valence is considered as the obligatory co-existence of an arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with the obligatory exclusion of certain others, relative to a verb seuse. Additional morphosynt~ctic, lexical and semantic selectional constrMnts are utilized to map a given syntactic argument structure to a specific verb sense. In recent years, there have been several studies on constrmnt-based lexicons. iR,ussell el al."]},{"title":"(1993)","paragraphs":["propose an approach to multiple default inheritance tbr unification-based lexicon.

In addition to the usual sense wu:iations due to selectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in most cases, the meaning conveyed by a. case Dante is idiomatic, with subtle constrMnts. For example, the Turkisln verb ye (cat), when used with a direct object noun phrase whose head is:","1. para (money), with no case or possessive markings and a lmman subject, means to accept bribe,","2. pare (money), wittn a non-human subject, means to cost a lol,","3. para (or any other NP whose head is ontologically IS-A money, e.g., dolar, mark, etc.) with obligatory accusative markilig ~md optional possessive meriting, means to spend *~IO~tCy~ 4."]},{"title":"kafa (head)","paragraphs":["with obligatory accusative marking and no possessive marking, means to get mentally deranged,","5. hak (right) with optionM accusative and possessive markings, mearls to be unfair, 854","6.

In general, there may be more than one instantiation of the SEM frame for a given instantiated set of case frame arguments (and vice versa). For instance, for the ye verb discussed above, the argument structure for the third case giving rise to the meaning to get mentally deranged may conceivably give rise to a literal meaning in a rather improbable context (such as eating the head of a fish at dinner - much in the spirit of the two interpretations of the English idiom kick the bucket), or the same semantics may be expressed by a different surface form. 3.2 Constraint Arehlteeture We express constraints on the arguments in the case frame of a verb via a 5-tier constraint hierarchy sharing constraints among the specification of other constraints and sense definitions, whenever possible: NP's that have no case-marking in Turkish.","1.
