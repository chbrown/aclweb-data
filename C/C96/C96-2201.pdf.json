It is based on the linguistic specifications and to some extent on the software of the EUROTRA project of the European Community (Copeland et al., 1991a; Copeland et al., 1991b). Pa'IYans consists of a core grammar and translation module and a host of peripheral utilities: terin databases, general databases, editors for pre- and postediting, document handling facilities, facilities for creating and updating term databases. In this short presentation we will concentrate on the grammar, lexicon and translation module and on some of the new features of Pa- ~i~'ans. 2 From EUROTRA to PaTrans EUROTRA was the European Community MT research programme. The Community started the programme in 1982, with the goal of creating an advanced systeln for automatic translation capable of treating all the otficial working languages of the Community. When the programme finished in 1992, it had delivered a huge amount of research 1paTrans was developed for Lingtech A/S. results and an implemented prototype of a multilingual translation system. The PaTrans developmeat relics on the prototype resources (Macgaard and Hansen, 1995), the system architecture and linguistic specifications, as well as on the experienced staff created by EUROTRA. 2.1 The EUROTRA Prototype EUROTI{A was a transfer-based multilingual MT project. Because of the multilinguality, the prototype was quite \"clean\" in terms of separate modules for analysis, transtL'r and synthesis of the various languages and language pairs. 2.1.1 Sottware","The software component consisted of the t;lanslation kernel, used tbr analysis, transfer and generation. The trmisb~tion kernel had mechanisms for treating grammar rules, dictionary information and mapping rules. 2.1.2 Lingware","For all languages, the project produced a large grammar and a general language dictionary. Though insufficient for the task at hand, the Pa: 'lk'ans development eould buil<l on the English and Danish grammars and dictionaries, as well as on the transfer module from English into Daifish. 2.2 Customizing EUROTRA Patent texts are characterised by the vocabulary they contain: terlns belonging t;o the fiehl tt'eated , e.g. chemistry, and patent document terms of a more legal nature. But; patent documents are also charaeterised by tile frequency of some linguistic phenomena and the absence of others, e.g. we had to develop ~ treatnmnt of lists and emmmration, and conversely we could simplify the treatment of modality considerably. The current maintenance and further development of the system continues this text type specific lille. The success of the system is mainly based on this fundamental lninciple of tailoring it; to a specific text type and sub jeer field. 1115"]},{"title":"3 An overview of the Translation Process 3.1 Document handling","paragraphs":["The document handling step has four main flmctions:","• Format Preservation Input to docuinent handling"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["a text from a text processing system which has been marked up in SGML.

They are recognised during text handling and have their translation equivalent attaehed to them along with inorphosyntactic information for both source and target language.","• Segmentation Finally tile text, is separated into units for translation i.e. sentences for which various recognition patterns haw ~. been set up. In some patent texts of specfic subject tields, tile sentences are incredibly long. In these cases, there is no point in trying to arrive at a complete parse of the whole sentence, since the parse is most likely to fail and processing will be too space and time consuming. Therefore the docmnent handler attempts to arrive at a meaningflfl partition of the sentences by identifying sentence internal boundaries and submitting the individual subparts for translation."]},{"title":"3.1.1 Disambiguation","paragraphs":["Before the text is passed on to the parser, it is subjected to a thorough process of disambiguation. This is one of the new features of PaTrans compared to the EUR()TRA model and will be discussed in detail below."]},{"title":"3.1.2 Source language analysis","paragraphs":["Since PaTrans is based on the transfer translation model tile surface strings of the text are sequentially transformed into an interinediate representation defined by several mapping principles.","During source language analysis the sentences are assigned a surface syntactic structure. This surface syntactic structure is converted into a language-neutral transfer represent, ation ordering the constituents of the sentence in a canonical order with heads preceeding arguments and ar= guments preceding modifiers (Copeland et al., 1991a). The, transfer representation is a reflection of tile argument structure of the predicates where iuformation about surface syntactic realization appears as features on the individual nodes. Function words (coRjmwtions, determiners, prepositional case markers) are featurized and tense/aspect and negation represented in language-neutral features.","The output of source language analysis is thus a tree with multilwered information including syntactic and morphosyntactic features, as well as the syntactic/semantic relationships between the predicators and the arguments,","At, all levels, sets of preference rules based on heuristic principles select among competing analyses, e.g. for PP-attachment (Bennett and Paggio, 1993)."]},{"title":"3.1.3","paragraphs":["Transfer","PaTrans adheres to simple transfer, i.e. the substitution of source language lexical units with target language lexical units by means of lexical transfer rules, 9 while the source language stru<> tural representation is mapped directly onto the target language transfer representation which is input to tile generation module. There are two main reasons why complex transfer (i.e. transfer where the strucl;ure of the input representation is altere(t) is kept at a minimum:","• Complex transfer is costly inasmuch as the general applicability of the rules is usually very restricted.","• A transfer rule applies to any object matching its left-hand side and performs the mapping defined on the right-hand side. Due to the 'fail-soft'-mechanisin (discussed below), the structure of the objects which the transfer rules nmst apply to cannot he flflly predicted. In order for complex transfer to work in all cases, rules must be set up not only for correctly parsed input structures, but also for tile special fail-soft structures. For this reason, complex transfer is costly and is only used for frequent phenomena considered crucial for good translation, e.g. converting certain English ing-forins into l)anish relative clauses."]},{"title":"3.1.4 Target syntactic generation","paragraphs":["During gelmration, the transti;r representation is mat)ped onto a target syntactic structure through intermediate representational lewfls.

There are two reasons why the tagger has been integrated into the system:","• Since the overall translation system is unification-based, words are disambiguated by the application of all possible rules, which is highly inefficient.","• If the sentence is fail-sorted, one intermediate analysis is picked from the chart, which means that all words may not have been disambiguated properly by the grammar rules. If, however, the words have been disambiguated and impossible readings have been discarded prior to parsing the 'best-fit'-parse is considerably better than it would otherwise have been.","The tagger is a public-domain, rule based tagger. It has been trained on a corpus of the Wall Street Journal and on patent texts within the subject field. In addition, it has been augmented with several 'local' contextual rules developed by the linguists working with PaTrans. The integration of the tagger has not only provided for more effecient processing but, more importantly, also for a higher quality of the translations of fail-softed sentences. Current efforts aim at improving the performance of the tagger."]},{"title":"5.3 Preparsing","paragraphs":["The original EUROTRA-parser has been augmented with special rules which apply before the actual grammar rules (Music, 1993). The goal is to enable more efficient handling of long sentences that are otherwise unprocessable given moderate resources. With pre-rules, sentences are segmented via pattern-matching, before they are sent to the parser. In this way, the number of parse paths that the system has to consider is reduced considerably.","To give greater power to the preparser, pre-rule application has been made cyclic. This means that the output from one rule application (or one application cycle) is used as input to a new cycle which starts at the beginning of the rule set. In principle then, any rule can feed (i.e. create the preconditions needed for application of) any other rule, while at the same time allowing prioritization of rules, The pre-rules not only add structure to the input, they are also used for lexical disambiguation based on collocatives and immediate context. Where the rule based tagger described above is able to determine the part-of-speech of individual words based on prior training and contextual rules, pre-rules can select individual readings of words within the same part-of-speech. Pre-rules have been developed for lexteal disambiguation and for parsing of adverbial phrases, complex verb groups, coordinated that-clauses, indexed lists, valency-bound prepositional phrases and explicitly marked intervals (e.g. from •.. to, between.., and). The effects of pre-rules are twofold: On tile one hand they assign structure to tile input at a shallow level, which nevertheless in-creases processing efficiency considerably, on the other hand they also improve fail-soft results since inappropriate readings of words in a given context are discarded at an early stage."]},{"title":"6 Performance","paragraphs":["PaTrans is in everyday use at the translation agency Lingtech where it is being used for all texts which are suited for it in its current version, i.e. chemical, biochemical, medical etc. patents, and gradually also a considerable amount of mechanical patents. PaTrans is making the translation process faster and more efficient, and it has proven to be a good business for Lingteeh, saving around 50% of the raw translator cost."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["PaTrans is a running production translation system producing cost-effective raw translations of patent texts. But PaTrans is also a project which combines academic research and practical applications and which has shown that MT is viable in limited domains. Current work concentrates on improving the coordination of the rule-based part of the systeln and the fail-soft component."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bennett, P. and Paggio, P., editors (1993).
