The idea of the model is to make the alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word order-ings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several bilingual corpora."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, we address the problem of word alignments for a bilingual corpus. In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems: (Brown et al., 1990), (Dagan et al., 1993), (Kay et al., 1993), (Fung et al., 1993).","In our approach, we use a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) (aelinek, 1976), which is similar, but not identical to those used in speech recognition. The key component of this approach is to make the alignment probabilities dependent not on the absolute position of the word alignment, but on its relative position; i.e. we consider the differences in the index of the word positions rather than the index itself.","The organization of the paper is as follows. After reviewing the statistical approach to machine translation, we first describe the conventional model (mixture model). We then present our first-order HMM approach in lull detail. Finally we present some experimental results and compare our model with the conventional model."]},{"title":"2 Review: Translation Model","paragraphs":["The goal is the translation of a text given in some language F into a target language E.

The characteristic feature of this approach is to make the alignment probabilities explicitly dependent on the alignment position of the previous word. We have tested the model successfully on real data. The HMM-based approach produces translation probabilities comparable to the mixture alignment model. When looking at the position alignments those generated by the ItMM model are in general much smoother. This could be especially helpful for languages such as German, where compound words are matched to several words in the source language. On the other hand, large jumps due to different word order-ings in the two languages are successfully modeled. We are presently studying and testing a nmltilevel HMM model that allows only a small number of large jumps. The ultimate test of the different alignment and translation models can only be carried out in the framework of a fully operational translation system."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This research was partly supported by the (]erman Federal Ministery of Education, Science, t{e-search and Technology under the Contract Number 01 IV 601 A (Verbmobil) and under the Esprit Research Project 20268 'EuTrans)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["L.
