The realization of such an automatic construction method would make it possible to a) save the cost of constructing a thesaurus by hand, b) do away with subjectivity inherent in a hand made thesaurus, and c) make it easier to adapt a natural language processing system to a new domain. In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic construction of thesauri. Specifically, we view the problem of automatically clustering words as that of estimating a joint distributiofl over the Cartesian product of a partition of a set of nouns (in general, any set of words) and a partition of a set of w:rbs (in general, any set of words), and propose an est.imation *Real World Computing Partership algorithm using simulated annealing with an energy function based on the blinimum Description Length (MDL) Principle. The MDL Principle is a well-motivated and theoretically sound principle for data compression and estimation in information theory and statistics. As a method of statisticM estimation MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal.","We empiricMly evMuated the effectiveness of our method. In particular, we compared the performance of an MDL-based sinm]ated anuealilag Mgorithm in hierarchical word clustering against. that of one based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE, for short). We found that the MDL-based method performs better than the MLE-based method. We also evaluated our method by conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using a thesaurus automatically constructed by it and found that disambiguation results can be improved.","Since some words never occur in a corpus, and thus cannot be reliably classified by a method solely based on corpus data, we propose to combine the use of an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus in disambiguation. We conducted some experiments in order to test the effectiveness of this strategy. Our experimental results indicate that combining an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus widens the coverage 1 of our disambiguation method, while maintaining high accuracy e."]},{"title":"2 The Problem Setting","paragraphs":["A method of constructing a thesaurus based on corpus data usually consists of the following three steps: (i) Extract co-occurrence data (e.g. case frame data, adjacency data) fl'om a corpus, (ii) Starting from a single class (or each word compos-ing its own class), divide (or merge) word classes","1 ~Cover~tge' refers to the proportion (in percentage) of test data for which the disambiguat.ion method can make a decision.","2'Accuracy' refers to the success rate, given that the disambiguation method makes a decision. based Oll the co-occurrence data using 8Ollle Sill> ilarity (distance) measure.

Thus, there is a trade-off relationship between the simplicity of a model and the goodness of fit to the data. The model description length quantifies the simplicity (complexity) of a model, and the data description length quantifies the tlt. to the data.

(This problem is usually referred to as the 'data sparseness problem'.) We could smooth the estimated probabilities using an existing smoothing technique (e.g., (Dagan el, al., 1992; Gale and Church, 1990)), then calculate some similarity measure using the smoothed probabilities, and then cluster words according to it. There is no guarantee, however, that the employed smoothing method is in any way consistent with the clustering method used subsequently. Our method based on MDL resolves this issue in a unified fashion. By employing models that embody the assumption that words belonging to a same class occur in the same context with equal likelihood, our method achieves the smoothing effect as a side effect of the clustering process, where the domains of smoothing coincide with the classes obtained by clustering. Thus, the coarseness or fineness of clustering also determines the degree of smoothing. All of these effects fall out naturally as a corollary of the imperatiw? of 'best possible estimation', the original motivation behind the MDL principle.","in our simulated annealing algorithm, we could alternatively employ the Maxinmm Likelihood Estimator (MLE) as criterion for the best probabilistic model, instead of MDL. MLE, as its name suggests, selects a model which maximizes the likelihood of the data, that is, /5 = a.rg maxp I-[~¢s P(x). This is equivalent to mininfizing the 'data description length' as defined in Section 3, i.e. i 5 = arg minp ~,~-~s - log P(x). We can see easily that MDL genet:al[zes MLE, in that it also takes into account the complexity of the model itself. In the presence of models with varying complexity, MLE tends to overfit the data, and output; a model that is too complex and tailored to fit the specifics of the input data. If we employ MLE as criterion in our simulated annealing algorithm, it. will result in selecting a very fine model with many small clusters, most of which will have probabilities estimated as zero. Thus, in contrast to employing MDL, it will not have the effect of smoothing a.t all.","Purely as a method of estimation as well, the superiority of MI)L over MLE is supported by convincing theoretical findings (c.f. (Barton and Cover, 1991; Yamanishi, 1992)). For instance, the speed of convergence of the models selected by MDL to the true model is known to be near optiinal.
