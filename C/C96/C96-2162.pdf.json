The theory claims that an ironic utterance implicitly communicates the fact that its utterance situation is surrounded by ironic environment which has three properties, but hearers can assume an utterance to be ironic even when they recognize that it implicitly communicates only two of the three properties. Implicit communication of three properties is accomplished in such a way that an utterance alludes to the speaker's expectation, violates pragmatic principles, and implies the speaker's emotional attitude. This paper also describes a method for computationally formalizing ironic environment and its implicit communication using situation theory with action theory."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Although non-literal language such as metaphor has become a popular topic in computational linguistics (Fass et al., 1991), no attention has been given to ironic uses of language. One reason for this imbalance is that traditional accounts of irony - and even default logic forlnalization (Perrault, 1990) - assume that irony communicates the opposite of the literal meaning. This assumption leads to the misconception that irony is governed only by a simple inversion mechanism, and thus it has no theoretical interest. Another reason is that studies of irony have been regarded as of no practical use for NLP systems. However, recent accounts denying the meaning-inversion assumption have revealed that irony is a more complicated pragmatic phenomenon governed by several mental processes (Kumon-Nakamnra et al., 1995), and dmt irony offers an effective way of accomplishing w~rious communication goals that are diff]cult to convey literally (Roberts and Kreuz, ]994).","The aim of this paper is to propose a unified theory of irony that answers to three crucial questions in an unequivocal manner: (Q1) what are properties that distinguish irony from non-ironic utterances, (Q2) how do hearers recognize utterances to be ironic, and (Q3) what do ironic utterances convey to he~rers? Our theory provides a computationally feasible framework of irony as the first, step toward a full-fledged computational model of irony, and it can account for several empirical findings fi'om psycholinguistics. The essential idea underlying our theory is that an ironic utterance"]},{"title":"implicitly displays ironic environment,","paragraphs":["a special situation which has three properties for being ironic, but the hearer does not have to see all the three properties implicitly communicated in order to recognize the utterance to be ironic. Note that this paper focuses only on verbal irony, and thus situational irony I (i.e., situations are ironic) is beyond the scope of our theory.","This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the problems of previous irony theories. Section 3 presents our unified theory of irony that can cope with the problems, and its computational formalization. Finally, Section 4 suggests that our theory agrees well with several empirical findings."]},{"title":"2 Previous theories of irony","paragraphs":["Several irony theories have been proposed in the last few decades, but all the theories, as we will explain, make the same mistake in that they confuse the two difl'erent questions (Q1) and (Q2).","The traditional pragmatic theory (Grice, 1975; Haverkate, 1990) assumes that, an utterance is recognized to be ironic when tile hearer becomes aware of an apparent violation of some pragmatic principles (e.g,, the maxim of quality or the sincerity conditions for speech acts), and as a result it conveys the opposite of the literal meaning. This theory, howew,~r, colnpletely fails to explain many ironic utterances. First, irony can be comnmnicared by various expressions that do not include such violation: true assertions such as (2a) in Figure 1, understatements such as (2c), and echoic utterances such as (5a). Moreover, Candy's husband of Example i can t)erceive Candy's ~ttter-ances (la)~(le) as ironic even under the situation where he does not know or is careless of Candy's expectation of satisfy her hunger, in other words, where he is not aware of the viQlation.

Secondly, it is not an answer to (Q1) because of its incompetence to discriminate irony from other non-literal utterances (e.g., a lie) in which the. maxim of quality is tlouted. Finally, the notion of \"the opt)osite of the literal mean-ing\" is problematic because it, is aplflicable only to declarative assertions hut many ironic utterances can take non-declarative forms: questions such as (lb); requests such as (2b); offerings such a.s (le); and expressives such as (3a).","Other recent theories e.g., mention theory (Wilson and Sperber, 1992) and echoic reminder theory (Kreuz and Ghmksberg, 1989) share a common view that by mentioning or alluding to someone's thought, utterance, expectation or (:nltural norm, an ironic utterance communicates a speaker's attitude toward a discrepancy between what actually is and what, has heen expected. This view may be essential to irony, but these theories ark still incomplete as a comprehensive framework h)r irony for at least three reasons. First, their concepts of mention/allusion Sper-her and Wilson's echoic interpretation and Kreuz and Glueksberg's echoic reminder are too narrow to capture the allusive llattn'e of irony (e.g., (lb), (le), (41))), and they are not clear enough to be formalized in a computable fashion, l,br example, Nancy's utterance (4a) in Fignre 1 ix an echoic interpretation of Nancy's expectation of the fine, weather, bttt (4b) does not interpretively echo any states of affairs: (4b) is an implication derived from the failed expectation. Second, they implicitly assume that the properties that characterize irony can be at)plied to recognition of ironic utterances as they stand or they do not focus oil how hearers recoglfize utterances to },)(; ironi(-. Thils they cannot also explain a certain kind of ironi(: utterances in which hearers are not aware of any pragmatic violation. Finally, these theories provide no plausible explanation of how irony is discriminated flom non-ironic echoic utterances.","Allusional pretense theory (Kumon-Nakamura et al., 1995) is the most powerflll one in that it can explain ironic utterances of five speech act classes using the two crucial notions of allusion (including echoic interpretation and reminder) and pragmatic insincerity. They (:laimed that all ironic utterances allude to a failed e, xpe, ctation and violate one of the felicity conditions for well-ibrmed speech acts. However, allusional pretense theory still sut[ers Dora the same disadvantage as other theories: their notion of allusion is not clear enough, and it does not focus on how hearers rec-Ogllize lltt, erallt;es t;o be ironic. 3 A unified theory of irony 3.1 Ironic Environtnent and Its Inlplicit","Display Our unitied theory of irony claims as an mmwer to (Q1) that irony is a figure of Sl)eeeh that inq)lie-itly displays the fact that its utteraime situation is surrounded by ironic environment.

Our theory allows us to Rive plausible answers to what irony is, how irony is recognized and what irony coinmuni(:ates. The properties of irony allusion, pragmatic insineeril,y, and emotional attitude arc formalized mmquivo(:ally enough to build a coInputational model of irony. From this I)oint ot' view, we be-lieve that this pal)er provides a basis [or dealing with irony in NLP systems, and we are develol)- ing computational methods for intert)reting mat generating irony (Utsumi, 1995)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.
