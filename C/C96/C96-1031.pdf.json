Both authors agree in characterizing morpho-syntactic errors as a sainple of lack of competence.","On the other hand, an examination of real texts produced by Spanish writers revealed that they do produce morpho-syntactic errors I .

Thus, scores are clues for the correction of those elements having the lowest scores.","The initialization steps in order to perform the heuristic technique are related to the assignment of values and scores to lexical projections depend-ing on its inherentness. The values for gender and number of the head of the projection serve as a parameter for the computation of values and scores for the possible modifier which could appear closed to it. Note that; agreement in Spanish is based on a binary value system. Thus, the computation of values for the modifier of a given head simply relies on the instantiation of opposite values to those of the head. In the case of underspecification of the head for gender, for instance, the presupposition is that this value is the same as the one of the modifier, if this is not underspecified. Otherwise, both elements remain underspecified. Besides, the weight given to controlling elements (50) ensures that there is no way for modifiers to overpass this score. Note as well that the weight given to inherentless values, as number (10), ensures that there are no promoted elements in this calculation. The following schematic CS illustrates the assignment of scores: and(=(Score'number'head,10), and(","or (and (: (lnherm~t~ess'head,yes), = (Score'gender'head,50)),","~u~d(= (lnherel~tness'head,no), (Score'gender'head, 10))),","=(Score'ntmlher'mod,0)))","The following steps to be performed by CSs are","related to the addition of all those scores associ-","ated to a given value in the successive rules build-","ing the nominal prbjection and the percolation of","morphosyntaetic features:","or(","and(or(:((lender'head'mother,Oendcr'mod), --(Gendcr'mod,mase'fem)), and(num'add(MG]gN 'SCOI,tF,'H I,]A D,","MGEN'SCORE'MOI),","M(~ EN'SCORE' MOTI IP, I{), and(= (Gender'mod'head,(lender'mod'mother),","hum'add (It (I EN'SCO l/,]'Y 11EAD,","HGEN'SOOII,E'MOD,","IlGEN'SCORE'MOTI[EII~)))),","alld(=(Gender'nmd,Gender'mod'head), and (nu re'add (H GEN'SCO I{E'ftEA I),","MCIEN'SCORE'MOD,","HGEN'SOORE'MOTIIER), and(=(Gender'mod'head,Gendcr'mod'mothcr),","num'add(MGEN'SCORE'HEAD, HGEN'SCOR, I~'MOD, MGEN'SCOI~E'MOTHER)))))","The final evahlation performed by CSs is done when categories showing agreement overpass their maximal projection, only if no other inter-syntagmatic agreement must be taken into account (as it is the case with subject-attribute agreement, for instance).

While structural weaknesses are detected in tim phrase structure rules using CSs (noun + \"a\" + infinitive), by means of an error anticipation strategy, lexical weaknesses arc detected at the lexical level, with no st)octal mechanisms other than simple CSs. Lexieal errors currently detected are related with the use of Latin words which it is better to avoid, foreign words with Spanish deriwttion, cognitive erl'ors, foreign words for which a Spanish word is recommended and verbosity."]},{"title":"5 Further developments","paragraphs":["i{,esults obtained with the cmTent demonst;rator are very promising. The performance of the system using CSs is similm' to that shown widlout them, hence its us(; in conjunction with the detection techniques proposed, rather than a burden, may be seen as a means to add robustness to NLP systems. In fact, CSs may provide more natural solutions to grammar implemental;ion issues, like PP-attachmellt control.","Several directions for further developments have a]ready been defined. These include the integration of these grammar checking techniques into the final release of the LS-GRAM Spanish grammar, which will have a more realistic coverage ill terms both of linguistic i)henomena and lexicon. Besides, on this new version of the grammar, hybrid teehniques will be used, taking advantage of the preproco.ssing facilities included in ALEP. In particular, while for errors like those presented in this paper the approach adopted is linguistically motivated, for certain imnctuation errors (or simply ill order to reduce lexi(:al arab*girl(y) other relatively simple iHeailS C~Lli be defined that ill-chide (:ertain extended pattern ma.tching on regular expressions or the passing of linguist*(: information gathered in a t)reproeessing phase to the unifh:ation-bas('.d parser.
