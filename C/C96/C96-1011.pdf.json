For example, if the word in question has both N and V tags, then the Learner would search for words with only an N tag or only a V tag.","3. If such a word is found, the contexts of that word are examined to determine if there is an overlap between them and the contexts generated for the ambiguously tagged word. One issue for this determination is how nmch ambiguity should be tolerated in the context of the unambiguously tagged word. For example, if one of the possible contexts is PRE-VTA(I=N and the word preceding the un ambiguously tagged word has both N and V tags, should the context apply?

One of tile drawbacks of an tlMM-based approach is that laborious manual tuning of symbol and transition biases is nec: essary to achieve high accuracy. Without tuned biases, the C, erman Xerox tagger achieved 85.89% while the French Xerox tagger achieved 87% accuracy. After one man-month of tuning biases, the accuracy of the French tagger increased to 96.8%. One could derive such biases fronl a corpus, as discussed in (Merialdo, 199d), but it unfortunately requires a tagged cort/us.","'Fhe best accuracy of the Spanish Xerox tag: ger was 91.51% for the reduced tag set (174 tags)","lit can be a part of a last name as it, \"van Mahler\", but also is an inflected form of \"it\". with the hase accuracy (i.e. no training) of 88.98% while the best accuracy of our tagger is currently 92.1% for the simple tag set (39 tags) with the base accuracy of 78.6%. The lower base accuracy in our exl>eriment is probably due to the large number of entries in the Collins dictionary. 6 Summary Our Spanish Part of Speech Tagger is a successful implementation and extension of Brill's unsuper: vised learning algorithm that reduces the ambiguity of part-of-speech tags on words in Spanish texts.","The system requires few, if any, hand-tagged texts to bootstrap itself. Rather, it merely requires a Spanish lexicon and morphological analyzer that can tag words with all their possible parts-of-speech.
