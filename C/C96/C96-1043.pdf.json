Writing a letter thcrcfore involves typing the code that corresponds to the desired pm'agraph and inserting the relevant elcnlents. The sentences or paragraphs thus produced are thcl'clbre concatenations o1' predefined and illSertcd texts.","l. A relatively high number of prcdefined sentences and paragraphs have to be provided, to cover the writers' needs, but:","2. In fact, writers use only a reduced set of predefined 13aragraphs, Ihe nunlber of which depending on tile writer.","3. The quality of tile t+esulting style of reply varies widely.","2.2 Automatic Hybrid Generation (IAnguistic + Template approach) lea Rcdoutc and GSI-Erli have developed a real-situation pilot system (for details on this project, see (Coch, David, and Magnolcr, 1995)) which builds up a text (i.e. a letter) fronl data entered by tile human operator who processes the request; a custonlcf database; and knowledge bases. It uses GSi-Erli's AlcthGen text generation toolbox (see (Coch, 1996)). The overall system is composed of two Inain modules: thc I)ccision module and the Generation module. The Decision module has the following functions: 249 • it allows the writer (who reads the request letter) to identify the author and subject of the request letter; • it asks the writer for relevant information;","• it suggests a decision (for example, order cancellation, renewal, etc.), after consulting the customer database and the domain knowledge;","• it asks the writer to validate the decision (or make a different choice);","• it communicates the relevant information to the Generation module. The Generation module automatically produces the reply letter in a standard l~rmat (SGML). This module consists of several submodulcs (for more details, see (Coch, David and Magnoler 1995) and (Coch and David, 1994)): the direct generator; the text deep-structure planner (or conceptual planner); the text surface-structure planner (or rhetorical planner); and linguistic realisation, inspired by the Meaning-Text Theory. The direct generator has two functions: 1. planning the text in direct mode (top-down), anti 2. generating more or less fixed expressions or non-","linguistic texts (i.e. tables, addresses, lists, etc.). The direct generator could be used without the other submodules to generate texts in an automatic but non-linguistic way (manipulation of character strings). Reiter (Reiter, 1995) calls this technique \"the template approach\". The output of the conceptual planner is the text's deep structure, in which the events to be era'tied out are not yet in a definitive order. The conceptual planner uses logical, causality, and time rules (see (Coch and David, 1994)). The rhetorical module chooses concrete operators, modalities and surlace order, according to rhetorical rules. The choices made depend on certain attributes, e.g. whether the addressee is aware of an event, whether an event is in the addressee's favour, and so on, Lastly, the linguistic generation submodule realises each event li'om the text surface structure. It uses anaphora (see (Coch, David and Wonsever, 1994)), semantic, deep-syntactic, surface-syntactic, and morphological rules. This sub-module is inspired mainly by the Meaning-Text Theory (as developed for example in (Mel'euk, 1988) and (Mel'euk and Polgubre 1988)). In accordance with Reiter (Reiter, 1995), La Redoute and GSI-Erli's system can be defined as \"hybrid\", because it uses both linguistic and template techniques."]},{"title":"2.3 Human writing","paragraphs":["The third technique used was human writing in \"ideal\" conditions: one of La Redoute's best writers wrote the letters with no time constraints."]},{"title":"2.4 Functional differences","paragraphs":["It is to be noted that the three techniques describexl differ from an external functional point of view:","• in the semi-automatic approach, the writer compose the letter themselves, even if assisted by a set of predefined-paragraph codes; • in the autonmtic hybrid approach, the operator enters data on the addressee and letter, but does not have to compose the reply letter; • in the third case, the writer has to write the letter. Reiter (Reiter, 1995) studied the difference between the linguistic generation anti template approaches. The two techniques do not differ from an external functional point of view."]},{"title":"3. Methodology 3.1 Evaluation Tests","paragraphs":["Black-box methodology was used for the assessmcm, which was era'tied out by an independent jury of 14 people, who were representative of end users, in a blind-test context. The jury was not informed of the automatic generation project. Each member of the jury examined the quality of a set of 60 letters (20 produced by the SA system, 20 by the automatic hybrid system, and 20 human-written, for identical cases). No member of the jury knew which technique had been used for producing each of the letters. Each member o1' the jury wrote a report on cad1 letter, with assessment values according to quality criteria. Examples of these criteria are: • correct spelling, • good grammar, • comprehensiveness, • rhythm and llow, • appropriateness of the tone, • proximity, personalisation, • absence of repetition, • correct choice and precision of the terminology","used. The first three criteria were considered as eliminatory, and were marked 0 or I. The other criteria were marked out of 20. There were also other criteria, but they were too application-oriented and confidential. 250 3.2 Reprcsentativity of the results Given that the tests used only 20 letters of each type, one might question their representativity. In fact, representativity is ensured by the projection of the results of the previous phase (system tests) which used the same quality criteria, involved a reductxl Jury (2 to 6 members), and was based on 200 test cases (200 letters of each type). The test cycle was performed six timcs:"]},{"title":"Delivery 7 \",,, Correction \\ ,/ Test Diagnosis","paragraphs":["After the sixth cycle, the average quality scores showed thai the results wottld be sufficiently representative.

Assessment results 4.1 Eliminatory criteria and overall average","paragraphs":["All the automatic and human letters met the eliminatory criteria standards. However, this was not the case for the senti-automatic system, in particular due to problems of comprehension, but also due to grammatical mistakes in the fill-in-the-blank system. The overall averages of the entire jury, for all the quality criteria (including application-oriented criteria), and for all the letters were as follows. • semi-automatic system: I 1 out of 20 • automatic hybrid system: 14.5 out of 20 • human-written letters: 15.5 out of 20. It can be seen that the quality of the letters generated by the pilot systeln using AlethGen was lar superior to that of the senti-automatic system using predetinexl paragraphs. These tests show that the \"Ideal\" human-written letters are, obviously, thc best. However, the differences between the hmnan-written letters and those produced by the automatic hybrid system ,'ue relatively slight. 4.2 Detailed results Below are the averages for the whole jury and all the letters, as regards the non-eliminatory criteria: 4.2.1 Rhythni and flow • scmi-automatic system: 12.8 out o1'20 • automatic hybrid system: 14 out of 20 • human-written letters: 16.8 out of 20 IIiffcrcnces : , ideal human letters 2.8 • atttomatic letters 1.2 • kleal httnmn letters 4 The difli:rence between the ideal human letters mid those obtained with the automatic hybrid system is considerable: 2.8 out of 20. vs. automatic letters: vs. SA lcttcrs: vs. SA letters: 4.2.2Right tone • Selni-automatic system: * autonmtic hybrid system: * huma,>written letters: Differences: . ideal human letters , automatic letters I 1.6 out of 20 13.6 out of 20 14.4 out of 20 vs. automatic letters: vs. SA letters: 0.8 2 251 • ideal human letters vs. SA letters: 2.8 The results obtained by the ideal human letters ~md those generated automatically are close.

Analysis of results and Conclusion 6.1 Analysis of results The order of results for tile different techniques is always tile same for all tile criteria: first, truman writing; second, the automatic hybrid approach; trod third, tile senti-automatic system. Let us now examine the salient points of each type o1' technique. Senti-automatic system 'File principal weak points of the semi-automatic system are as follows, in decreasing order of variation in relation to the human averages.","• l:,liminalory criteria not always reel due lo problems of comprehension and gramlnar.","• Excessive repetition (a diflcrence of 6.4 out of 20 ill relalion Io human writing, and of 3.6 ira rehrtion to tire automatic system). ° l,ack of pcrsonalisation (5.6 and 3.2). • Lack of precision in the choice of vocabulary (4.4 and 2.4). Automatic hybrid system The principal strong points of the automatic linguistic-and-templates system based on AlethGen are as follows, in decreasing order of variation in relation to lhe semi-automatic averages. • Eliminatory criteria always met.","• Absence of repelition (3.6 out of 20 better than tile semi-automatic system).","* Proximity, personalisation (3.2 better than the semi-automatic system). * Precision in the choice of vocabulary (2.4 better'). The main points for improvement for lhe automatic system are as follows, in decreasing order of variation in relation to the human averages. 253","• Absence of repetition (human letters 2.8 out of 20 better). • Rhythm and flow (human letters 2.8 better). • Proximity, personalisation (human letters 2.4 better). Human writing The best characteristics of the human letters were absence of repetition, and proximity / personalisation, which were both given scores of 17.6 out of 20. it can be seen that the jury considers the tone of the human letters as being not very good: only 14.4 out of 20. This would appear to be mainly ['or reasons related to commercial communication rather than computational linguistics. 6.2 Conclusion The first conclusion is that semi-automatic systems (just as real-situation human writing) are subject to human mistakes, and that the texts they produce may be difficult to understand. The second conclusion is that the weak points of the semi-automatic systems are the strong points of the automatic hybrid systems, in the same order. We can conclude that, even if current automatic generation systems could do better (and we believe that this will soon be the case), one of the two main reasons for using linguistic-and-template hybrid systems such as that developed by La Redoute ~md GSI-Erli, rather than using semi-automatic systems, is the improvement in quality (the other being, of course, productivity). Although there are more research and industrial projects in Analysis than in Natural Language Generation, Generation has great potential, since the gains in terms of quality and productivity largely justify the investment."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Jose Coch and Raphael David. 1994.
