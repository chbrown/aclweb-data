A tired translator can accidentally skip a sentence or a paragraph in a large text. Pressing a wrong key can cause a word processing system to delete several lines without warning. Such anomalies can usnally be detected by carefnl proof-reading. However, price competition is forcing translation bureaus to cut down on this labor-intensive practice. An automatic method of detecting omissions (:an be a great help in maintaining translation quality.","ADOMIT is an algorithm for Automatic Detection of OMissions in Translations. ADOMIT rests on principles of geometry, and uses no linguistic information. This property allows it to deal equally well with omissions that do not correspond to linguistic units, such as might result from word-processing mishaps. ADOMIT is limited only by the quality of the available bitext map.","The paper begins by describing the geometric properties of bitext maps. These properties en-able the Basic Method for detecting omissions. Section 5 suggests how the omission detection technique can be embodied in a translators' tool. The main challenge to perfect omission detection is noise in bitext maps, which is characterized in Section 6. ADOMIT is a more robust varia-tion of the Basic Method. Section 7 explains how ADOMIT filters out some of the noise in bitext maps. Section 8 demonstrates AI)OMIT's performance aim its value as a quality control tool."]},{"title":"2 Bitext Maps","paragraphs":["Any algorithm for detecting omissions in a translation must use a process of eliminatiorl: It; must first decide which segments of the original text have corresponding segments in the translation. This decision requires a detailed description of the correspondence between units of the original text; and milts of the translation. To un(lerstand such correspondence, think of the original text and the translation as a single bitext (Hat ris, 1988). A description of the correspondence between the two halves of the bitext is called a bitext map. At least two methods for finding bitext maps have been described in tile literature (Church, 1993; Melamed, 1996). Both methods output a sequence of corresponding character positions in the two texts. The novelty of' the omission detection method presented in this paper Dies in analyzing these correspondence points geometrically.","A text and its translation can form the axes of a rectangular bitext space, as in Figure 1. The height and width of the rectangle correspond to the lengths of the two texts, in characters. The lower leg corner of ttle rectangle represents the texts' beginnings. The upper right corner represents the texts' ends. If we know other corresponding character positions between the two texts, we can plot them as points in the bitext space.

Translations are seldom word for word. Metaphors and idioms usually cannot be translated literally; so, paraphrasing is common. Sometimes, a paraphrased translation is nmch shorter or much longer than the original• Segments of the bitext map that represent such translations will have slope characteristics sin> ilar to omissions, even though the translations nmy be perfectly valid. These cases are termed intended omissions to distinguish them fl:om omission errors. To be useful, the omission detection algorithm must be able to tell the difference between intended and unintended omissions.","Fortnnately, the two kinds of omissions have very different length distributions. Intended omissions are seldom longer than a few words, whereas accidental omissions are often on the of der of a sentence or more. So, an easy automatic way to separate the accidental omissions from the intended omissions is to sort; all the omitted segments from longest to shortest. The longer accidental omissions will float to the top of the sorted list;.","Translators can search for omissions after they finish a translation, just like other writers run spelling checkers, after they finish writing. A translator who wants to correct omission errors can find them by scanning the sorted list of omitted segments Dora the top, and examining the relevant regions of the bitext. Each time the list points to an accidental omission, the translator ('an make the appropriate correction in the translation. If the translation is reasonably complete, the accidental omissions will quickly stop appear-ing in the list and the correction process can stop. Only the smallest errors of omission will remain. 6 The Problem of Noisy Maps The results of l!]xperiment ~l demonstrate ADOMI'F's t)otential. Ilowever, such stellar performance is only possible with a nearly perfect bitext map. Snch bitext maps rarely exist outside the laboratory; today's 1lest autonmtic methods for finding tlitext maps are far fl'om perfect (Church, 1993; l)agan et ah, 1993; Melamed, 1996). At least two kinds of map errors can interfere with omission detection. One kind results in Sl)urious omitted segments, while the other hides real omissions.","I!'igure 2 shows how erroneous points in a bitext map can be indistinguishable from omitted segments.

A typical manifestation is illustrated in Figure 1. The map points in Region O contradict the injective property of bitext maps. Most of the points in Region O are probably noise, because they map many positions on the x-axis to just a few positions on the y-axis. Such spurious points break up large omitted segments into seqnences of small ones. When the omitted segments are sorted by length for presentation to the translator, the fragmented omitted segments will sink to the bottom of the list along with segments that correspond to small intended omissions.

This is important because the noise in a bitext map is mort likely 1,o obscure a short otnissio, dlan a long one. 767","The simulated omissions' lengths were chosen to represent the lengths of typical sentences and paragraphs in real texts. A corpus of 61479 Le Monde paragraphs yielded a median French paragraph length of 553 characters. 1 had no corpus of French sentences, so I estimated the median French sentence length less directly. A corpus of 43747 Wall ,5'trent Jo,~rnal sentences yielded a median English sentence length of 126 characters. This number was multiplied by 1.103, the ratio of text lengths in the \"easy\" bitext, to yield a median French sentence length of 139. Of course, the lengths of sentences and paragraphs in other text genres will vary. The nledian lengths of sentences and paragraphs in this paper are 114 and 730 characters, respectively. Longer omissions arc easier to detect.","The placement of silnulated omissions in the text was governed by the assumption that translators' errors of omission occur independently fl:oIn one another. This assumption implied that it was reasonable to scatter the simulated omissions in the text using any meinoryless distribution. Such a distribution simplitied the experimental design, because performance on a fixed number of omissions in one text would be the same as per-refinance on the same number of omissions scattered among multiple texts. As a result, the bitext mapping algorithm had to be run only once per parameter set, instead of separately for each of the 100 omissions in that parameter set.","A useflll evaluation of any omission detection algorithm must take. the human factor into account. A translator is unlikely to slog through a long series of false omissions to make sure thai; there are no more true omissions in the translation. Several consecutive false onfissions will deter the translator from searching any further.

For the purposes of the simulation, these English segments served as the \"true\" omitted segments.","3. The SIMI{. bitext mapping algorithm (Melamed, 1996) was used to find a map between the original English text and the French text; containing the simulated omissions. Note that SIMI{ cnn be used with or without a translation lexicon. Use of a translation lexicon results in more accurate bitext maps, which make omission detection easier. However, wide-coverage translation lexicons are rarely awfilable. +tb make the evMuation more representative, SIMR was run without this resource.","4.

The wflue of the \"true on;fissions\" counter at that point represented the recall achieved by translators who give up after 3 consecutive false omissions.
