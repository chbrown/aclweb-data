'Yhe main goal of our work is to expand the thesaurus automatically, explicitly including distinguishing features (viewpoints), and to construct a domain-setlsitive thesaurus system.",":Co expand the vocabulary of the thesaurus, it is important to position new words in it automati- (:ally. In this paper, words that are not contained in the thesa.urus but that appeared in the corpus more than once are called unknown words, l '['he proper positions of the unknown words in the thesaurus are estimated by using woM-to-word relationships extracte(l from a large:sca.le corpus. This task may be similar to word-sense disambiguation, which deter-I|Hlles the correct sellse of a, word from several predefined candidates. However, in l)ositioning a word whose sense is 1,11knowtl, a suitable position must be selected from thousands of nodes (words) it, the thesaurus, and therefore it is very difficult to position the word with pinpoint accuracy. Instead~ in this paper~ we give a method for determining the area in which the unknown words belongs. For example, suppose the word \"SENTOUKI\" (fighter) 2 is not contained in a thesaurus. Calculation of the similarity between the word and those in the thesaurus a.sslgns it to tile area [flying vehicle [air plane, helicopter]].","Viewpoints are features that distinguish a. node from other nodes in the thesaurus, and are good (:lues for estimating the area to which an unknown wor<l should be assign(d.
