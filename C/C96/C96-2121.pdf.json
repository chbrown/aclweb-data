In the same way ~ words are strings of characters, sentences are strings of words. So, the shift from words to sentences is just of matter of reformula-tion.","Wc also recall that edit distances and edit operations are not contined to strings; they extend in a natural way to forests, and hence to trees. In fact, it is possible to give a definition of an edit distance on forests which generalises the definitions on strings (Wagner & Fischer 74) and on 7arsala (he sent) and aslama (he became converted) verbs 3rd person singular past; mursilun (a sender) and muslirnun (a convert) agent nouns. 8Balg (pelt, skin) and Iials (neck) singular; Biilge and Hdlse plural. 9 orang (human being) singular, orang-orang plural. trees (Selkow 77). Hence the possibility of apply-ing analogy to trees.","The example-based approach in machine translation, inaugurated by (Nagao 84) and illustrated by (Sadler and Vendelmans 90) or (Sato 90), for instance, relies on the assumption that, if two sentences are \"ek)se\", then, their analyses should be \"close\" too. By consequence, if the analysis of a first sentence is known, the analysis of the second one could be obtained by performing slight \"modifications\" (>it it. A problem arises: where are the slight \"modifications\" to be performed, and what; are they? In that matter, edit distances could help a lot: \"close\" means at a distance not too large, and ':modifications\" are edit operations."]},{"title":"4.1 Analysis by analogy 4.1.1","paragraphs":["Principle","Suppose we have a collection of sentences (a data-base) already analysed (in fact, a tree-bank). For a new sentence, called the prototype, our goal is to build its analysis, i.e., a corresponding tree. Of course, the ideal case is when the prototype is already present in the tree-bank, which means that the analysis is tbnnd there too.","In general, the prototype will not be found in the tree-bank. The search may thus be relaxed to similar sentences. Now, if at least two different sentences are retrieved by approximate matching, a fourth one can be built by analogy. Figure 2 illustrates this: the prototype is in the upper left corner; the two sentences on its right and under it have been obtained by approximate matching. Knowing the respective distances between these three sentences (on the arrows), sentence x can be computed by analogy.","it' by chance sentence x belongs to the tree-bank, its analysis is also in the tree-bank. Now, a reverse process on trees delivers an analysis for the prototype, as illustrated in Figure 3. The three trees in the right and bottom corners are the corresponding analyses of the sentences of Figure 2. They were taken from the tree-bank. The distances are given on the arrows. Tree y is the solution of the analogy, and we claim that it is the analysis of the prototype sentence. 4.1.2 Implementation","Approximate matching is retrieval of all sentences at a distance less than a threshold Kom a given prototype. Efficient algorithms, using dynamic programming, have been proposed to pertbrm approximate matching (Ukkonen 83) and (Landau & Vishkin 88). Our method is some-what different. We do as if we wanted to generate the entire set of sentences at a distance less than or equal to the threshold. In doing that, we introduce a don't care symbol representing any possible word.
