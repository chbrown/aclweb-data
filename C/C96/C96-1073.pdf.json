In this paper, we extend the unification based approach to cases which are often seen as a test-bed for focus theory: utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions. We then show that the resulting analysis favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus (namely, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meano ings theory) in that it correctly generates interpretations which these alternative theories cannot yield. Finally, we discuss the formal properties of the approach and argue that even though HOU need not terminate, for the class of unification-problems dealt with in this paper, HOU avoids this shortcoming and is in fact computationally tractable. 1 Introduction In this paper, we argue that Higher Order Unification (HOU) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus. Building up on (Pulman, 1995), we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory. For data which is generally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence expressions), we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under- and over-generation. Focus is a much debated notion. In this paper, we assume a simplifed version of Jackendoff's definition: a focus is the semantic value of a prosoditally prominent element. We take the identifica-tion of prosodically prominent elements as given.","To set the stage for this paper, we will briefly review the folklore, i.e. the main issues of focus theory. It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Semantic Value (FSV). The name and definition of the FSV varies from author to author: Jackendoff (Jackendoff, 1972) calls it the presuppositional set, Rooth (Rooth, 1992) the Alternative Sct and Krifka (Krifka, 1992) the Ground. In this paper, we assume a definition of the FSV which is in essence Rooth's Alternative set, that is, tile set of semantic objects obtained by making an appropriate substitution in the focus position. For instance, the FSV of (la) is defined as (lb), the set of properties of the form like-lug y where y is an individual (in what follows, focus is indica~ted using upper-case; we also follow Montague's convention that for any type % D~ is the set of objects of type r and wff~ is the set of wits of type r). (1) a. Jon only likes MARY"]},{"title":"b. lyc","paragraphs":["It is also usuMly agreed that certain linguistic elements associate with focus in that the meaning of the utterance containing these elements varies depending on the choice of focus. For instance in (2a-b), the focus operator only associates with focus so that the difference in focus between (2a) and (2b) induces a difference in meaning between the two utterances: in a world where aon introduced Paul to Mary and Sarah, and no other introduction takes place, (2a) is necessarily 430 false whilst (2b) is true.

On the basis of this value, we can then define the FSV, written Gd, ms follows: Definition 3.1 (['beus Semantic Value) Let Gd be of type c~ = ~ -+ t and ~ be the number of loci (~ < k), then the fibcus Hemantic Value derivable f,'om Gd, \"writlen (;d, is {(;d(t'...*'~) I t \"i < wff~,}.","As mentioned before, this yields a focus semantic value which is in essence i{ooth's Alternative Set 1 .","IThongh in fact, our definition is more syntactic than Rooth. In Rooth's approach, the I\"SV definition is purely semantic whereas in our approach the FSV is indirectly defined by solving equations and the value thus obtained (i.e. the value of Gd) is a term, that is, a syntactic object. Hence, our I\"SV can he more accurately contpared to Kratzer's presuppositior~ skeletort,. This means that our approach inherits the adwmtages of Kratzer's approach (c['. (Kratzer, 1991)).

As we shall see, the main reason for this is that the |[OU approach makes minimal assumptions about the role syntax plays in determining the FSV. In particular, it relies neither on the use of Quantifier l{aising, nor on the assumption of a rule to rule definition of the FSV. In this way, it avoids some of the pitfalls these theories encounter. ti(:ular, it adequately captures the interaction of focus with VP ellipsis as illustrated by Kratzer's notorious ex~ttnI)le: I ordy wer~t to TANGLE'WOO1) because you did.","2 Unification yields another possible value of C'd, namely A yXx.l(x,m). In what follows, we assume a restriction similar to the DSP's Primary Oeeurren(:e Restriction (l)ah'ymple et al., 1991)'s: the occurrence directly associated with the focus is a primary occurrence and any solution containing a primary occurrence is discarded as linguistically invalid. For instance, *n is a primary occurrence in the equation Xx.l(x,,n) = Gd(m) so thai; the solution Gd = AUA.9:.I(x, 7n) is invalid. For a formal treatment of l)SP's Primary Occurrence Restriction and a discussion of how it can be extended to {bcus, see ((?,ardent and Kohlhase, 1996). 431","We begin by a brief summary of l~.ooth's and Krifka's theories and stress the properties relevant for the present discussion. We then confront the three theories with the data. 4.1 Two alternative theories of focus Rooth's Alternative Semanti(:s","In l~,ooth's approach, the FSV is detined by re- (:ursion on the truth conditional structure which is itself derived from LF (i.e. Logical Form, the Government and Binding level of semantic representation). Focus is then seen as introducing a free variable whose value is determined by the current context and is filrthermore constrained to be an element or a subset of the FSV. For our purpose, the following characteristics are particularly important:","• Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set, a focus operator associates with any tbcus occurring in its scope.","• Any NP may be subject to Quantifier Raising. Importantly, this includes focused NPs.","• Quantifier Raising may not apply to quantitiers occurring in a scope -island.","Note that Rooth's approach criticaJly relies on quantifier raising as a means of moving a focused NP out of the scope, of a focus operator. However this only applies if the focus NP is not eml:)edded in a scope island. Kritl~t's Structured Meanings","Krifl(a's approach defines a rule-to-.rule semantics which assigns to any syntactic constituent, a meaning which can be either a k term or a structured meaning, i.e. a tuple oF the form {Gd,/\") where Gd is Krilka's I,'ocus Semantic Value and 1,\" is a (possibly cornl)Iex) [bcus.","For our purpose, an iinportant characteristic o[' Krifka.'s approach is the tight syntax/semantic interaction it presupposes. In particular, the theory requires that a focus operator combines with a syntactic constituent C whose, structured se.mantics C' -- (Gd, F) provides the focus (1,') this operator associates with. In other words, the right - adjacent sibling of a [b(:us operator must contain all and only the loci this operator associates with. As we shMl later see, some of the data does not seem to square with this assumption. 4.2 Multiple Focus Operators","Utterances with multiple locus operators 3 are","known pathological cases of focus theory: (3) a.

In (Gardent et al., 1996), we show in more detail how the analysis accounts for the interaction of focus with anaphora and definiteness in the case of a particular instantiation of SOEs, namely corrections. Comparison with Rooth and Krifka","Under the Alternative Semantics approach, SOEs are captured as follows. It is assumed that the quantification domain of focus operators is a variable whose value is contextually determined. In the standard case (i.e. the case where the focus is prosodically marked), this quantification domain of focus operators is usually identified with tire FSV of the VP. However, in the SOE cases, the assumption is that the quantification domain of focus operators is identified with the FSV of the source clause. Thus in (5a), the quantification of only in the second clause is identified with the FSV of the preceding utterance i.e. the set of properties of the ~brm like ing somebody.","But now, consider the following example: (6) a. don only likes MARY.","b. * No, PETER only likes Sarah.","Clearly, this dialog is ill-formed in that (6b) is no appropriate correction for (6a). However, under the Alternative Semantics approach, it will not be ruled out since the FSV of (6a) provides an appropriate quantification domain for the focus operator in (6b): as required by the semantic of pre verbal only, it is a set of properties whose elements can be identified with the VP semantic value Ax.l(x, rn). Hence although Rooth's approach captures some cases of SOEs, it does not seem to provide an adequate characterisation of the phenomena at hand.","The Structured Meanings proposal distinguisires between proper- and quasi-SOEs. Proper-SOEs involve an exact repetition of some previous linguistic material, and are analysed as involving an anaphor which is constrained by the restriction that it be a segmental copy of its antecedent. For instance, the semantics of only likes Mary in (5b) is not determined by the semantics of its parts but is instead identified with the semantic value of its antecedent only likes MARY in (5a). In contrast, quasi SOEs only involve semantic equivalence between repeating and repeated material (for instance, in a quasi-SOE a repeated element may be pronominalised). Krifka claims that quasi-SOEs have prosodically marked loci and thus do not raise any specific difficulty.","However this theory faces a number of methodological and empirical difficulties. First, it is non compositional because tire meaning of the deaccented material in proper-SOEs is solely defined by the meaning of its antecedent (rather than the meaning of its parts). Second, the prosodic data is rather unclear: the assumption that quasi-SOE contains a prosodically marked focus is a moot point (cf. (Bartels, 1995)) and if it proves to be false, the analysis fails to account for quasi-SOEs. Third, it is counterintuitive in that it handles separately two classes of data (i.e. quasi- and proper SOEs) which naturally belong together. Indeed, the HOU approach can be shown to provide a uniform treatment of quasi - and proper-SOEs (cf. (Gardent et al., 1996)).","5 Formal properties of the HOU approach The unification problem can be stated as follows: Given two terms of a logic M and N, is there a substitution, or, of terms for variables that will makethe two terms identical (i.e. ~r(M) = (r(N))?","It is well-known that for Higher-Order Logic (e.g. the typed A calculus) the space of solutions can be infinite and furthermore, the HOU problem is only semi-decidable so that tile unification algorithm need not terminate for unsolvable problems.","Fortunately, in our case we are not interested in general unification, but we can use the fact that our formulae belong to very restricted syntactic subclasses, for which much better results are known. In particular, the fact that free variables only occur on the left hand side of our equations reduces the problem of finding solutions to higher-order matching, of which decidability has been proven for the subclass of third-order formulae (Dowek, 1992) and is conjectured for tile general case. This class, (intuitively allowing only nesting flmctions as arguments up to depth two) covers all of our examples in this paper. For a discussion of other subclasses of formulae, where higher-order unification is computationally feasible see (Prehofer, 1994). 6 Conclusion In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computing Focus Semantic Values. To this end, we have considered data which is viewed as a test-- bed for focus theory and shown that, whilst exist-ing theories either under-generate, over-generate or are methodologically unsatist%ctory, the ttOU approach yields a simple and transparent analysis. There appear to be two main reasons for this. 434","l,'irst, the HOU analysis makes minimal assumptions about the role syntax is called to play in determining the I\"SV. lit is detined on a purely semantic level in the sense that unification operates on semantic representations, and relies neither on quantifier raising, nor on a rule-to-rule definition of the FSV. As we have seen, this type of approach is a plausible way to avoid undergeneration.","Second, the HOU approach permits an equational analysis which can naturally be Nrther constrained by additional equations. The interest of such an approach was illustrated in our treatment of SOEs which we characterise as involving two phenomena: the computation of an I\"SV, and the resolution of a &'accented anaphor. Not only did we show that this analysis is methodologically and empirically sound, we also showed that it finds a natural realisation in the equational framework of IIOU: each linguistic phenomena is characterised by some equation(s) and the equations may mutually constrain each other. For instance, in the case of SOEs, we saw that the equations characterising the deaccented anaphor help determine the unidentified FSV of the utterance containing the unmarke(I focus.","Clearly, our approach extends to cases of a(t-verbial quantification. For lack of space we could not develop the theory here; let us just point out that yon Fintel's criticism (von Fintel, 1995) of semantic approaches to tbcus, also applies to Krifka's Structured Meanings analysis, but not to the ItOU approach presented here. Von Fintel points out that in certain cases of adverbial quantification, a focus operator associates with an unmarked tbcus and dots not associate with a marked tbcus occurring in its scope - as should be clear fl'om this article, this is unproblematic for our analysis.","Of course, there art still many open issues. First, how does the proposed analysis interact with quantification? Second, how does it extend to a dynamic semantics (e.g. Discourse Representation Theory)'? 7' Acknowledgments The work reported in this paper was flmded by the l)eutsche l,~orschungsgetneinschaft (I)FG) in Sonderforschungsbereieh S1\"B-378, Project C2 (MSA).
