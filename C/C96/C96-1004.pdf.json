The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems: 1) Extracting case fl'ames from corpus data, 2) Generalizing case frame slots wMfin these case frames, 3) Learning dependencies that exist between these generalized case frame slots.","In this paper, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots. By *Real World Computing Partnership 'dependency' is meant the relation that exists between case frame slots which constrains the possible values assumed by each of those slots.

We proposed to use dependency forests to represent case frame pa~terns. It is possible that more complicated probabilistic dependency graphs like Bayesian networks would be more appropriate for representing case frame patterns. This would require even more data and thus the I)roblenl of how to collect sufficient data would be.a crucial issue, in addition to the methodology (ff learning case frame patterns as probabilistic dependency graphs. Finally the problem of how to determine obligatory/optional cases based on dependencies (acquired fi'om data.) should also be addressed."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eric Bril] and Philip Resnik. 1994.
