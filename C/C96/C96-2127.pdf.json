One possible answer to this problem is the use of generic and modula.r software. An example fbr a software system develot)e.d with this goal in mind is the FUF generator (l~lhadnd, 1991), a well-documented public domain software written in IASI: ). Still, it is no straightforward task to employ that, kind of software for new applications. Another important step is the declarative definition of linguistic data (grammar and lexicon) which also fa(:ilit~tes reuse in another setting. The reuse of existing resources does not only save efforts but, to a hopeflflly much minor extent, also creates new tasks to be solved, i.e. the integration of resources not having been","*The work reported here h,~s been carried out within tit('.

Second, it allows for interaction between two-level rules and word grammar facilitating the formulation of rules for non-concatenative morphol.actics like umlaut."]},{"title":"3 The Integration Task","paragraphs":["Although the main components to be integrated fulfill reusability requirements (FU F being a fairly general and modular generation engine, the HPSG grammar being a declaratively written resource), integration of these resources into a unified system couhl only be achieved after suitable adaptation. The morphological component of FUF is very restricted. Thus it needed to be replaced by X2MorF. The available German word level grammar of X2MorF was rewritten to conform to the feature structure notation employed by FUF. The two-hwel part stayed unchanged. More substan- |ial changes were required to adapt the HPSG granLmar. Not only syntactic adaptations to another feature formalism were needed, but also the olmrational characteristics of' FUF had to be accounted for. Also some of the phrase structure information generalized in the form of principles could be \"compiled\" into phrase structure rules. 3.1 HPSG in FUF First experiments to implement ItPSG in FUF rather directly showed inetficient runtime behavior. Since most grammatical constraints in IIPSG are expressed via structure sharing, and FUF uses pointers to indicate coreferences, most of the processing time was spent in following pointer chains through deeply nested feature structures. Thus the structures have considerably been fiattened and some aspects (most notably SUBCAT and CONTent) have beet, encoded differently. 754 pleiNei'll,, a,u ;tdjurlet,, ;i. marker or a filler (realizing l,he shcsh l'e&t,lll'e (if l;|le tt(;;ul d;-:uighl, er). l!]a('h consl;ituenl, sl;rHcture is (;onsl_d'~:titl0d by {/.[1 aSsoci;d.e(l sel, or (h)mimmce s(:heniai, a and princillles.","iII)S(l (lis/,inguishes be/,ween s,lz/Ls/,a'#l, bive (',aJ;e-gories (Sllch ;1.8 ilOllil8 or ver|)8) ~md ,[:[ul, clio,l, al (-a,tegories (e.g., (leterininers).

However, the standard word order - a sentence final verbal complex with the finite verb as the last dement - is encountered only in subordinate clauses. In declarative sentences and wh-questions the finite element of the verbal complex occupies the second position in the sentence. Sen-tence initial position of the finite verb is encountered in imperative clauses and yes-no questions.","In our grammar, the verbal complex is always generated in the standard order. To account for VI and V2 phenomena, a mechanism resembling the GB notion of head movement is imple- ((cat s) (s-type declarative) (head-dtr((cat vk)","(head ((vform fin)))","(head-slash ((cat lex-verb))))) (v2 {̂head-dtr head-slash}) (subj ((head ((case hem)","(num {̂̂̂head hum})","(pers {̂̂̂head pers}))))i (args ((subj {̂subj}))) ;; force extraction of one constituent (alt (((focus GIVEg)","(focus {̂args slash}))","((focus {- subj})","(subj {̂args slash})))) (cset (head-dtr)) (pattern (focus v2 args head-dtr))) Figure 8: Declarative Main Clause in FUF mented. This mechanism flmctions analogously to the slash mechanism presented above. If a feature head-slash is passed to the verbal temple:, the finite verb is extracted, allowing the govern-ing phrase to realize it in first or second position. The morphology component ensures that separable prefixes are left, in place.","The vert)al complex is generated top down. 'l'he arguments of the main verb are generated lexicon driven, once the lexical head of the phrase has been established.","Subject-verb agreement and nominative case as-signment is handled via the subj slot which is coreferential with args: subj and - after argument generation -contains the subject of the sentence (of. Fig. 6). Verb second position (:an only be ensltred, if the constituent in sentence initial l)osition is nonempty. The slot focus is designed to hold that constituent. The constituent to be topicalized or, if not specified in the input, the subj is extracte<t via the slash mechanism (cf. Fig. 7).
