The representation is designed as a basis for use in applications like text-to-speech and speech translation systems. It is obvious that for a non-tiring, natural output, especially tile prosodic side of IS has to be taken into account. In this section, examples from sentence-based translation with semantic transfer visualize the role of IS in several empirical domains. For one thing, ignoring IS may result in confusing translations: (2) with default accenting, 2 despite being truthconditionally equivalent, is not a suitable translation for (1B) in tile given context.

However, the other examples make clear that focus can be effectively applied in sentence-based translation exploiting the existing linguistic focus marking within the sentence. Costly reasoning can 'thus be restricted to doubtful cases. 670","A sentence-based account of IS faces one problem: in the general case, a certain prosodic marking of a sentence does not correspond to a unique IS. These cases of focus ambiguity have been discussed extensiw~ly in the literature and will be briefly reviewed in see. 2. The existing HPSG account of IS by Engdahl/Vallduvi (1994) gelmrales a disjunction of alternative sentence analyses for ambiguous sentences, a Since focus ambiguity mull;Jiffies with all other kimts of ambiguity, a disjunctive treatment makes the use of IS in computational applications unattractiw;. Therefore, an underspecified representation of IS is proposed in this paper (sec. 3) along with a resolution routine on the basis of context information (see. 4). Finally, the linguistic principles that compose the representation are worked out in HPSG (see. 5). The data discussed are Gerlnan, but English is very similar. 2 Focus marking The basic data are well-known. 4 A pitch accent on a direct object like, Buch in (7), can serve to mark a number of constituents as focused: (8). 5 The focus Dature is usually assumed to proje.ct.","(7) Karl hat ein BucII gelesen.

The VP can, e.g., either belong to FOC (via a chain of arrows) or to BG. The graph in (20) represents the amount of information that is encoded on sentence level without reference to context. Additional knowledge may introduce further solid arrows. If, e.g., a begriiflen event is contextually given (like in a question Who greets whom?), the arrow from begriiflt to BG will become an obligatory arrow. This arrow again will overrule the dashed arrow from begriiflt to ihren Besuch. Since the latter was the only path to access the FOC partition, the complete graph will collapse into a fully specified representation of IS. Resolution will be dealt with in more detail in sec. 4.","The principles composing the representation are worked out formally in sec. 5. Here is an intuitive overview: the arrows pointing directly to the FOC and BG partition originate from accenting or nonaccenting of the single words, respectively. The additional arrows between the constituent nodes are introduced by the grammatical principles of F-projection irrespective of the actual prosodic marking. This becomes clear when we regard the following alternative prosodic marking of (19): (21) MARIA BEGRUSST ihren Besuch. Maria begr/iBt ihren Besuch ' begrii]]t 'qhren Besuch","(22) ', , ', , begrfii~t"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["', ,, lhren Maria \",', Besuch \\ / BG FOG Note that here, the dashed arrow from"]},{"title":"begriiflt","paragraphs":["to ihren Besuch is overruled right away, since the accented begriiflt is strictly tied to FOC. The 672 phrase ihren Besuch is forced into tile BG partition, thus the utterance is correctly predicted to be restricted to contexts where Besueh is given. As anticipated above in tile discussion of the lexical ambiguity involved, this conelusioil can be drawn even if other points remain underspecified. 4 Resolution An underspecified IS arising from tile prosodic marking of a sentence can be resolved by information from the context. As noted above, entaihnent by context introduces additional solid line arrows. rlb covet\" more than just trivial cases, the (:ounterpart of Schwarzschild's (1995) F-skeleton has to bc kept track of in the underst)ecified representation. At first glance, this seems to be incompatible with the idea of underspeeification, since the F-skeleton that is checked against the context for entailment, requires settlement on what the actual F-marking is. For instance, to check the givenncss of the VP in (23), reads a book about X has to be entailed, whereas on the basis of the marking in (24), reads Y has to be entailed. (23) I%anz liest ein Buch filler [S('ml\"FE.]F","l~'anz reads a book about ships (24) bYanz liest [ein Buch filler [ScHnq\"m]F]F","The solution lies in the observation that the latter F-skeleton entails the former. So, when a certain constituent (e.g., again the VP in the abow~ examples) is checked for givenness, it suffices to assume F-marking of the maximal potentially F-marked subconstituents (I call this the maximality assumption). If it turns out that the actual F-marking is more restricted, this will be detected at a lower level. For example, if (23) is the right solution, this will be discovered even if reads a book about X is not checked, since in this case, a book about X will be contextually given as well.","To illustrate resolution in tile graph representation, take the following example in context: (25) a.
