An instructor is therefore required not only to prescribe the appropriate actions to the reader, but also to prevent the reader from executing the inappropriate and potentially dangerous alternatives. The first task, which is commonly achieved by giving simple imperative commands and statements of purpose, has received considerable attention in both the interpretation (e.g., (Di Eugenio, 1993)) and the generation communities (e.g., (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995)). The second, achieved through the use of preventative expressions, has received corn siderably less attention. Such expressions can indicate actions that the agent should not perform, or manners of execution that the agent should not adopt. An agent may be told, for example, \"Do not enter\" or \"Take care not to push too hard\".","* This work is partially supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (~n,- sac) Grant J19221 and by the Commission of the European Union Grant LRE-62009.","t After September 1, Dr. Vander Linden's address will be Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science, Calvin College, Grand l~apids, MI 49546, USA.","Both of the examples just given involve negation (\"do not\" and \"take care not\"). Although this is not strictly necessary for preventative expressions (e.g., one might say \"stay out\" rather than \"do not enter\"), we will focus on the use of negative forms in this paper. We will use the following categorisation of explicit preventative expressions:","• negative imperatives proper (termed DONT imperatives). These are characterised by the negative auxiliary do not or don't.","(1) Your sheet vinyl floor may be vinyl asbestos, which is no longer on the market. Don't sand it or tear it up because this will put dangerous asbestos fibers into the air.","• other preventative imperatives (termed neg-TC imperatives). These include take care and be careful followed by a negative infinitival complement, as in the following examples:"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["To book the strip, fold the bottom third or more of the strip over the middle of the panel, pasted sides together, taking care not to crease the wallpaper sharply at the fold."]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["If your plans call for replacing the wood base molding with vinyl cove molding, be careful not to damage the walls as you remove the wood base.","The question of interest for us is under which conditions one or the other of the surface forms is chosen. We are currently using this information to drive the generation of warning messages in the DRAFTER system (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio, 1996). We will start, by discussing previous work on negative imperatives, and by presenting an hy-. pothesis to be exI)lored. We will then describe the nature of our corpus and our coding schema, 346 detailing the results of our inter-coder reliability tests. Finally, we will describe the results of our analysis of the correlation between function and form features.","2 Related work on Negative Imperatives While instructional text has sparked much interest in both the semantics/pragmatics community and the computational linguistics community, little work on preventative expressions, and in particular on negative imperatives, has been done. This lack of interest in the two coinmunities has been in some sense complementary.","In semantics and pragmatics, negation has been extensively studied (cf. Itorn (1989)). hnperarives, on the other hand, have not (for a notahle exception, see Davies (1986)).","In computational linguistics, on the other hand, positive imperatives have been extensively investigated, both from the point of view of interpretation (Vere and Bickmore, 1990; Alterman et al., 1991; Chapman, 1991; Di Eugenio, 1993) and generation (Mellish and Evans, 1989; McKeown et al., 1990; Paris et al., 1995; Vander Linden and Martin, 1995). Little work, however, has been (tirected at negative imt)eratives. (for exceptions see the work of Vere and Bickmore (1990) in interpretation and of Ansari (1995) in generation). 3 A Priori Hypotheses Di Eugenio (1993) lint forward the following hypothesis concerning the realization of preventative expressions. In this discussion, S refers to the instructor (speaker / writer) who is referred to with feminine pronouns, and H to the agent (hearer / reader), referred to with masculine t)ronouns:","• DONT imperatives. A DONT imperative is used when S expects H to be aware of a certain choice point, but to be likely to choose the wrong alternative among many possibly infinite ones, as in:"]},{"title":"(4)","paragraphs":["Dust-mop or vacuum your parquet floor as you would carpeting. Do not scrub or wet-mop the parquet. Here, H is aware of the choice of various clean-ing methods, but m W choose an inappropriate one (i.e., scrul)bing or wet-mopping).","• Neg-TC imperatives. In general, neg-TC imperatives are used when S expects H to overlook a certain choice point; such choice point may be identified through a possible side effect that the wrong choice will cause. It may, for example, be used when H might execute an action in an undesirable way. Consider:","(5) To make a piercing cut, first drill a hole in the waste stock on the interior of the pattern. If you want to save the waste stock for later use, drill the hole near a corner in the pattern. Be careful not to drill through the pattern line. Here, H has some choices as regards the exact position where to drill, so S constrains him by saying Be careful not to drill through the pattern line.","So tile ilypothesis is that H's awareness of the presence of a certain choice point in executing a set of instructions affects the choice of one preventative expression over another. This hypothesis, however, was based on a small corpus and on intuitions. In this paper we present a more systematic analysis. 4 Corpus and coding Our interest is in finding correlations between features related to the function of a preventative expression, and those related to the form of that expression. Functional features are the semantic features of the message being expressed and the pragmatic features of the context of communication. The h)rm feature is the grammatical structure of the expression. In this section we will start with a discussion of our corpus, and then detail the function and form features that we have coded. We will conclude with a discussion of the inter-coder reliability of our coding. 4.1 Corpus The raw instructional corpus t}'om which we take all the examples we have coded has been collected opportunistically off the internet and from other sources. It is at)l)roximately 4 MB in size and is made entirely of written English instructional texts. The corpus includes a collection of recipes (1.7 MB), two comt)lete do-it-yourself nmnuals (RD, 1991; McGowan and R. DuBern, 1991) (1.2 MB) l , a set of comt)utcr games instructions, the Sun Open-windows on-line instructions, and a collection of administrative application forms. As a","1These do-it-yourself manuals were scanned by Joseph ltosenzweig. 347 collection, these texts are the result of a variety of authors working in a variety of instructional contexts.","We broke the corpus texts into expressions using a simple sentence breaking algorithm and then collected the negative imperatives by probing for expressions that contain the grammatical forms we were interested in (e.g., expressions containing phrases such as \"don't\" and \"take care\"). The first row in Table 1 shows the frequency of occurrence for each of the grammatical forms we probed for. These grammatical forms, 1175 occurrences in all, constitute 2.5% of the expressions in the full corpus. We then filtered the results of this probe in two ways:","1. When the probe returned more than 100 examples for a grammatical form, we randomly selected around 100 of those returned. We took all the examples for those forms that returned fewer than 100 examples. The number of examples that resulted is shown in row 2 of Table 1 (labelled \"raw sample\").","2. We removed those examples that, although they contained the desired lexical string, did not constitute negative imperatives. This pruning was done when the example was not an imperative (e.g., \"If you don't see the Mail Tool window ... \") and when the example was not negative (e.g., \"Make sure to lock the bit tightly in the collar.\"). The number of examples which resulted is shown in row 3 of Table 1 (labelled \"final coding\"). Note that the majority of the \"make sure\" examples were removed here because they were ensurative. As shown in Table 1, the final corpus sample is made up of 239 examples, all of which have been coded for the features to be discussed in the next two sections. 4.2 Form Because of its syntactic nature, the form feature coding was very robust. The possible feature values were: DONT -- for the do not and don't forms discussed above; and neg-TC -- for take care, make sure, ensure, be careful, be sure, be certain expressions with negative arguments. 4.3 Function Features The design of semantic/pragmatic features usually requires a series of iterations and modifications. We will discuss our schema, explaining the reasons behind our choices when necessary. We coded for two function features: INTENTIONALITY and AWARENESS, which we will illustrate in turn using ~ to refer to the negated action. The conception of these features was inspired by the hypothesis put forward in Section 3, as we will briefly discuss below. 4.3.1 Intentlonality","This feature encodes whether the agent consciously adopts the intention of performing a. We settled on two values, CON(scious) and UNC (onscious). As the names of these values may be slightly misleading, we discuss them in detail here:","CON is used to code situations where S expects H to intend to perform ~. This often happens when S expects H to be aware that ~ is an alternative to the ~ H should perform, and to consider them equivalent, while S knows that this is not the case. Consider Ex. (4) above. If the negative imperative Do not scrub or wet-mop the parquet were not included, the agent might have chosen to scrub or wet-mop because these actions may result in deeper cleaning, and because he was unaware of the bad consequences.","UNC is perhaps a less felicitous name because we certainly don't mean that the agent may perform actions while being unconscious! Rather, we mean that the agent doesn't realise that there is a choice point It is used in two situations: when c~ is totally accidental, as in: (6) Be careful not to burn the garlic. In the domain of cooking, no agent would consciously burn the garlic. Alternatively, an example is coded as UNC when a has to be intentionally planned for, but the agent may not take into account a crucial feature of a, as in:","(7) Don't charge - or store a tool where the temperature is below 40 degrees F or above 105 degrees. While clearly the agent will have to intend to perform charging or storing a tool, he is likely to overlook, at least in S's conception, that temperature could have a negative impact on the results of such actions. 4.3.2 Awareness","This binary feature captures whether the agent is AWare or UNAWare that the consequences of are bad. These features are detailed now: 348 Raw Grep Raw Sample Final Coding","DONT Neg-TC","II d°n~t I d° not II take care make sure be careful 417 385 21 229 52 100 99 21 104 52 78 89 17 3 46","167 72 be sure 71 71 6 Table 1: l)istribution of negative imperatives","UNAW is used when H is perceived to be unaware that a is bad. For example, Exampie (7) (\"Don't charge or store a tool where the temt)erature is below 40 degrees F oz' above 105 degrees\") is coded as UNAW because it is unlikely that tile reader will know about this restriction;","AW is used when It is aware that a is bad. Example (6) (\"Be careful not to burn the garlic\") is coded as AW t)e(:ause the reader is well aware that burning things when cooking them is bad. 4.4 Inter-coder reliability Each author independently coded each of the features for all tile examples in tile sample. The percentage agreement is 76.1% for intentionality and 92.5% for awareness. Until very recently, these values would most; likely have been accepted as a basis for fllrther analysis. To support a more rigorous analysis, however, wc have followed Carletta's suggestion (1996) of using the K coettMcnt (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as a measure of coder agreement. This statistic not only measures agreement, but also factors out chance agreement, and is used for nominal (or categorical) scales. In nominal scales, tiler(; is no relation between the different categories, and classification induces equivalence classes on the set of classified objects. In our coding schema, each feature determines a nominal scale on its own. Thus, we report the values of the K statistics for each feature we coded for.","if P(A) is the prot)ortion of times the coders agree, and P(E) is the t)rot)ortion of times that coders are expected to agree by chance, K is computed as follows:","K = P(A) - P(E) 1 - P(E) Thus, if there is total agreement among the coders, K will be 1; if there is no agreement other than chance agreement, K will be 0. There are various ways of computing P(E); according to Siegel and Castellan (1988), most researchers Table 2: liability Kappa Value Reliability Level .00 - .20 .21 - .40 .41 .60 .61 .80 .81 1.00 slight fair moderate substantial almost t)erfe.ct Tim Kappa Statistic and Inter-coder Re-feature K INTENTIONALITY 0.51 AWARENESS 0.75 Table 3: Kappa values for flmction features agree oil tile following formula, which we also adopted:"]},{"title":": Zg","paragraphs":["j=l where m is the nulnber of categories, and pj is the proportiorL of t)bjccts assigned to category j.","The mere fact that K may have a vahw. k greater than zero is not sufficient to draw any conclusion, though, as it inust be estabfished whether k is significantly different fl'om zero. While Siegel and Castellan (1988, p.289) point out that it is possible to check tile significance of K when tile ,lumber of objects is large, Rietveh! and van Hout (1993) suggest a much simpler correlation between K values and inter-coder reliability, shown in Figure 2.","For the form feature, the Kappa wfiue is 1.0, which is not surprising given its syntactic nature. The flmction features, which are more subjective in nature, engender more disagreenmnt ainong coders, as shown by the K vahms in Table 3. According to Rietveld and van Hout, tile awareness feature shows \"substantial\" agreement and the in-tentioimlity feature shows \"mo(lerate\" agreement."]},{"title":"5 Analysis","paragraphs":["In our analysis, we have attempted to discover and to empirically verify correlations between tile 349 feature X 2 significance level intentionality 51.4 0.001 awareness 56.9 0.001 Table 4: X 2 statistic and significance levels function features and the form feature. We did this by computing X 2 statistics for the various functional features as they compared with form distinction between DONT and neg-TC imperatives. Given that the features were all two-valued we were able to use the following definition of the statistic, taken from (Siegel and Castellan, 1988):","= N(IAD - BCI -"]},{"title":"(A + B)(C 4- D)(A 4- O)(B 4- D)","paragraphs":["Here N is the total number of examples and A-D are the values of the elements of the 2x2 contingency table (see Figure 5). The X 2 statistic is appropriate for the correlation of two independent samples of nominally coded data, and this particular definition of it is in line with Siegel's recommendations for 2x2 contingency tables in which N > 40 (Siegel and Castellan, 1988, page 123). Concerning the assumption of independence, while it is, in fact, possible that some of the examples may have been written by a single author, the corpus was written by a considerable number of authors. Even the larger works (e.g., the cookbooks and the do-it-yourself manuals) are collections of the work of multiple authors. We felt it acceptable, therefore, to view the examples as independent and use the X 2 statistic.","To compute X 2 for the coded examples in our corpus, we collected all the examples for which we agreed on both of the functional features (i.e., intentionality and awareness). Of the 239 total examples, 165 met this criteria. Table 4 lists the X 2 statistic and its related level of significance for each of the features. The significance levels for intentionality and awareness indicate that the features do correlate with the forms. We will focus on these features in the remainder of this section.","The 2x 2 contingency table from which the intentionality value was derived is shown in Table 5. This table shows the frequencies of examples marked as conscious or unconscious in relation to those marked as DONT and neg-TC. A strong tendency is indicated to prevent actions the reader is likely to consciously execute using the DONT form. Note that the table entry for conscious/neg-TC is 0, indicating that there were no examples marked as both CON and neg-TC.

In our coding, awareness was then shifted to awareness of bad consequences rather than of choices per se. However, the basic intuition that awareness plays a role in the choice of surface form is supported, as the contingency table for this feature in Table 6 shows. It indicates a strong preference ibr the use of the DONT form when the reader is presumed to be unaware of the negative consequences of the action to be prevented, the reverse being true for the use of the neg-TC form.","The results of this analysis, therefore, demonstrate that the intentionality and awareness features do co-vary with grammatical form, and in particular, support a form of the hypothesis put forward in Section 3."]},{"title":"6 Application","paragraphs":["We have successfully used the correlations discussed here to support the generation of warning messages in the DRAFTER project (Paris and Vander Linden, 1996).
