For instance in our ontology, 'segment', 'artery', 'stenosis' and 'human' have four different types, and are not comparable by the IS-A relation,"]},{"title":"e.g.","paragraphs":["nothing can be both a segment and an artery} This is a voluntary, method-ological choice (Bouaud et al., 1995), motivated by the fact that these objects give rise to different inferences and must not be confused by the reason-ing component. Additionally, in the target normalised conceptual representation, what constitutes the specific theme (in our conceptual model, the purported_oh j) of action 'angioplasty' must be precisely defined. In the context of our application, 'angioplasty' acts on an artery_segment, a physical object corresponding to a part of an artery, which happens not to be comparable to any of the four preceding themes of 'angioplasty'. 2 Therefore, all four examples (2)-(5) must be considered as metonymies.","1Segment, in our ontology, corresponds to a portion of space, not of matter.","2Notice, though, that these types are strongly linked (by relations other than IS-A) through the knowledge base models. The semantic analyser precisely recovers these links thanks to the mechanism presented in this paper.","To handle metonymy, Fass (1988) proposes a method based on a list of alternations implemented as specific metonymy rules: Part_for-_Whole, Container-for_Contents, etc. Sowa (1992) considers metonymies around the term \"Prix Goncourt\", originally introduced by Kayser (1988): this term undergoes different meaning shifts in each of seven example sentences, ranging from the author who won the prize to the amount of money received. Sowa discusses how background knowledge could help to process these metonymies, based on a knowledge description of what \"Prix Goncourt\" involves.","In our system, the target conceptual representation is defined by a domain model expressed with CGs. This same model constitutes the resource which enables the analyser to handle metonymies. We explain below how results similar to Pustejovsky's type coercion may be obtained with a method based on this domain model instead of a qualia structure. 3 Method 3.1 Rationale The input to the semantic analyser is the syntactic representation of a sentence produced by a previous large coverage syntactic analyser (B~rard-Dugourd et al., 1989). This representation connects words, or predicates, with grammatical relations such as subject, object, oblique object, modifier, etc. The output of the semantic analyser is a conceptual graph on which pragmatic inferences are performed to enrich the representation.","In the semantic lexicon, each word points to one or more conceptual representations. The grammatical link between two words in a sentence expresses a conceptual link between their two associated conceptual counterparts. The task of the semantic analyser is to identify this conceptual link. Rather than including the knowledge needed for this task in the semantic lexicon, or in a specific rule base, the program will examine the domain knowledge to resolve the link. The method relies on a heuristic path search algorithm that exploits the graphic aspects of the conceptual graphs for-malism. 3.2 Domain knowledge The main domain knowledge elements consist of the domain ontology (Fig. 1) which is a subsump-tion hierarchy of concept types (henceforth simply 'types') and of relation types, and of a set of reference models attached to the main types.","The reference model of a type represents knowledge about this type as a conceptual graph (Fig. 2). Basically, a conceptual graph is a bipartite graph with concept nodes (or concepts) labeled with a type plus an optional referent, and relation nodes labeled with relation types (Chein and Mugnier, 1992).

Predicates map to conceptual graphs; most of them are reduced to one concept, since most of the words in the lexicon are technical terms for which a type exists. Figure 3 reports some lexical entries.","It is difficult to map grammatical relations to static, predefined conceptual representations, since their meaning in the domain depends on their context of use, and mostly on the predicates they link. Besides, one cannot think of envisioning all the possible uses of such a relation, partly because of the use of metonymy. The conceptual representation of an actual grammatical link will therefore be computed dynamically by the semantic analyser using its context: the linked predicates and domain knowledge. However, each grammatical relation may have conceptual preferences for types or for conceptual relations. These preferences are associated with the grammatical relation. Our grammatical relations include oblique complements, so that prepositions in our semantic lexicon are expressed under this second paradigm (Fig. 3).","Entry angioplastie-f is [Angiopiasty: *x].","Entry stenose_f is [Stenosis: *x].","Entry segment-iI_f is [SegmentAh*x]-","(relative_to)-+[Artery]","(spatial.l\"ole) +- [Spatial_Object]","-+ (zone_of)-+ [Artery ~egment].

Then, the following models are the reference models inherited along the ontology through supertypes of T. As the type hierarchy is, in our system, a tree (Bouaud et al., 1995), the models for a predicate are strictly ordered. Considering two grammatically linked predicates, the product of their models constitutes as many model pairs that can be potentially used to look for possible chains. Such pairs are structured by a partial order based on the generality rank of their members, a 3.4.4 Heuristic chain selection.","At this stage, we are provided with all the possibles chains between P1 and P2 extracted from their models.

In a variant approach (Mineur and Buitelaar, 1995), a word has no a priori semantic type; it in selected at composition time among the types found in the qualia. In our approach, the head concept type associated with an argument does not change. The chain found between this concept and the predicate's head concept only brings forward internmdiate concepts and relations which are aetualised in th(; presence of the I)re(ticate, and lead to a particular representation of their lnt?an-ing.

The aim of semantic analysis, in this context, is to build a representation which conforms to a domain model. We therefore experimented how this domain model could help semantic analysis to go from the flexibility of natural language to a constrained conceptual representation, a typical problem encountered being metonymy. The approach presented here shows how this can be performed. It has been fully implemented, and used with a reasonable size knowledge base as a part of the MENELAS text understanding system.","Metonymy processing is based on the domain model. Provided a new domain and task, with the corresponding domain model, this enables the generic method to adapt directly to this new domain and give results that are specific to it. Build-ing such a domain model is generally feasible in sufficiently limited domains, typically, technical domains. Much of the strength of the method then hinges on the quality of the domain model: the concept type hierarchy and the attached reference models must be built in a principled way (Bouand et al., 1995)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A.
