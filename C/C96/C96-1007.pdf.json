This position is the one defended in (Kmnp and Reyle, 1993).","We first review the arguments in favour of our view, and then summarize the discussion presented in (Amsili and Le Draoulec, 1996) against the counter-arguments to this view presented in (de Swart and Molendijk, 1994). We summarize our semantic proposal in the section 2.3. Simplicity. One of the reasons wily we may prefer the representation Klb tO K~b is that it is simpler, from the technical point of view. Thus, if such a representation is sufficient to account for all the data we want to account for, then there is no need for a more complex representation like tile one exemplified in K~b. Another point worth not-ing is that, the second proposal is also more complex from the ontological point of view. Adding new types of discourse referents like ~ in the language of DRS requires that we define their ontological properties. And since these new kinds are defined in terms of others kinds of discourse referents, this may well be a non-trivial task. Negation in discourse. The ideas developed in this paragraph are based on a study of negation in discourse currently in progress. The aim of this study is to see how negation interferes with so-called discourse relations (continuation, elaboration, explanation...). To do this, we are using a large corpus taken from French contemporary literature. We shall not describe this study in detail here; nevertheless, one of its findings is relevant to our discussion.","We have looked at examples involving French passg simple (PS, simple past). This tense typically introduces an event rather than a state. We have a set of 1399 examples of sentential negation, in which one find only 46 occurrences of PS. Among these examples, a majority are of the form exemplified in (3).","(3) a. Je ne lui rfipondis pas. I didn't answer him. b. ~ Elle ne sursauta pas. She didn't startle.","Thus, in a majority of cases, PS+negation seems to be used to assert, the absence of an event, and it is very difficult in those cases to find a \"real event\" which could be seen as denoted by the sentence.","3 cases in the corpus seem however to suggest that negated event sentences may denote events:","(4) a. Elle ne le voulut pas. She didn't want it. b. L'autre ne prit pas de d~tour. The other didn't mince words. c. Elle ne se laissa pas faire. She didn't let things flow.","Thus, one can easily imagine that (4a) \"refers to\" a gesture, or some kind of behaviour that could be interpreted as a refusal. Here, of course, this reflmal could probably be associated with ~.","But these examples are rare; moreover, the two last sentences of (4) involve more or less idiomatic expressions, so that it seems quite reasonable to see negation here as part of a conventionalised expression (\"he passe laisser faire\" denoting an event, just like the verb to refuse does).","Events can be defined as a change of state. With this definition in mind, we think that, at least in the case of PS, negation over events is used mostly to convey something like \"nothing changed\", or \"the expected event didn't occur\", and there is in this case no event denoted by tile sentence. There remain some cases (very few) where such sentences seem to denote some real change of the background, but then we claim that negation is lexically incorporated, and no longer sentential. The classical example. We come now to the \"classical\" example of (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). It involves tile following discourses:","(5) a. Mary looked at Bill. He smiled. b. Mary looked at Bill. He was smiling. c. Mary looked at Bill. He didn't smile. d. Mary looked at Bill. He wasn't smiling.","The pair (5a-5b) exemplify the contrast between simple past and progressive past in narrative discourse. In the second sentence of (5a), the simple past introduces a new event,, which is localised after tile event introduced in the previous sentence. In constrast, the second sentence of (5b) introduces a state, which overlaps with the event of the previous sentence. This analysis gives tile correct prediction for the contrast: in (5a), Bi{l's smiling is interpreted as a reaction to Mary's look-ing at Bill, thus following it, whereas in (5b), Bill was already smiling when Mary looked at him.","The contrast in (5c-5d) is clearly parallel to that in (5a-5b). Since the second sentence of (5d) call reasonably be thought of as introducing a state, also introducing a state for the second (negative) sentence of (5c) would lead us to lose the contrast, since this would suggest, for both sentences that Bill was not smiling when Mary looked at him. Counter-arguments. We summarize here the discussion given in (Amsili and Le Draoulec, 1996) against some of tile arguments given in favour of the idea,that negative sentences denote an eventuality. There are two main arguments. One is based on the fact that negated event sentences accept durative complements (whereas their positive counterpart do not), this fact being taken as an argument in favour of the aspectual role of negation. Our answers are: first, some French data suggest that durative complements with negation should 30","not always be seen as demonstrating the din'aliv-e' ity of the predicate; second, Kamp and Reyl. s"]},{"title":"(1993)","paragraphs":["representation provides a satisfying way to account tbr such data.

Roughly, the interpretation of a negated sentence induces the following steps ill tile construction of a DRS: • introduction of a location time t; • introduction of a condition relating t with the speech time n; • introduction of a con(lition saying that there is no event or state of a certain l;yl)e which stands in the relation 'C' or '0' /.o t.","As an example, the diseom'se (5c) will receive the represenl;atioil (6), the most relevant points of which being, first, that a temporal constant (t) is systematically introduced into the representation, and second, that negation has wide scope over event/state discourse referents, t remaining outside negation. x y n t e u t r Mary(x) ]fill(y) t< n eCt e:-~ look at y]","(6) . l; t < II"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["~] e < e I 3 Syntactic Aspects We now briefly address l;he syntactic aspects of French sentential negation.

Several sl;udies on the structure of I,~'ench clauses, and ill t)articular, negative sentences, have been carried out recently ill this framework by Pollock (1989; 1993), Hirshbiihler and Labelle (1993; 1994a) and Pearce (1994) among others. In this section, we adopt some of their most relevant results.","We are mainly concerned with two of the four levels of representation of GB, namely D-Structure and S-Structure. Tile representations of tiles(; two levels are trees. D-structures represent basic lexical properties such as thematic relations. S-structures represent more superficial properties such as case, binding, etc. S-structures derive fi'om D-structures via Move-a: they are the result of movements that take place in tile latter. In this section, we attempt to answer the following two questions: (1) what is the D-structure of French negative clauses? (2) which move.ments take place between D-Structure and S-Structure? 3.1 Split Inflexion Hypothesis The. lPrench clause representations we use are rather classical. They satisfy X'-theory, which uses well-known syntactic concepts independent of any theoretical Damework. % represent clauses and to build their DRSs, we use a tree structure consisting of a verb phrase VP dominated by tile projection iP of a functional head I bearing the verbal tense and agreement features (I stands for"]},{"title":"inflezion).","paragraphs":["IP has the sentence subject NP as its specitier and the.

The general structure of French clauses that Pollock (1989) proposes is (8a), so that for instance (7b)becomes (8b): (8) a. [Tp NI' rp [Agrt .... Agr [VP (AdvP) VP]]]","b. ['rl' [NP Julie][~,., [7'/ regarde] [Ag,-l' [Agr' [Agr i","t] [vp [v, Iv, t] [m' Mare]]]]]]] 3.2 Negation (Pollock, 1989) also claims that negation, like tense and verb agreement, is represented as a funcl;ional category, Neg, located between T and Agr.","2Note that the morphological decomposition of the verb, shown in (7b), will not be. made explicit in tile following representations. 31 In French, this category contains the negative item ne, seen as a weak affix lacking morphological stress. In S-Structure, ne must adjoin to the verb as a clitic. More generally, it must raise to T in finite clauses as well as infinitives.","This proposal has been accepted by many linguists. However, there is no similar consensus about the position in D-Structure and the possible movements of the second element of French negation, namely one of the adverbs pas, plus, point, guSt'e, etc. Here we adopt the proposal of (Hirschbiihler and Labelle, 1993) which states that pas (or any of the other negative adverbs) is an adjunct to the maximal projection governed by Neg. Since Ncg is located between T and Agr, this projection is AgrP. The general structure of a lq-ench negative clause is therefore: [TP NP"]},{"title":"T [NegP","paragraphs":["Neg"]},{"title":"[agrP","paragraphs":["Agr [vl' (AdvP) VP]]]]"]},{"title":"a.a The Aspeetual Dimension of Agr","paragraphs":["The previous clause structure improves significantly the correspondence between syntactic representation and semantic interpretation. In particular, it becomes easier to differentiate the semantic contribution of each element that is relevant at the aspectuo-temporal level. These elements fall into two categories: those below negation (and therefore inside its scope) and those above negation.","Following (de Preitas, 1994; Borer, 1993; Latca, 1990), we consider Agr to be rather an aspectual category Asp in charge of the aspectual dimension of the semantic representations. This dimension is introduced by discourse referents. Recall that DRT discourse referents do not serve only to account for this aspectual dimension, but do play a fundamental discursive role. Nevertheless, the categorisation into states (s) and events (e) of the utterances to bc represented, and the possible introduction of the discourse referents of one of these aspectual category, may be associated with the Asp head. This association gives us the expeeled result: the discourse referent e or s is in the scope (in the sense of DRS construction) of the possible negation.","These elements are all illustrated in the cornplete syntactic representation of the sentence (9) given in figure 2. Notice the attachment of the sentential adverb aujourd'hui as adjunct to TP, the highest projection of the representation. Because of space limitation, we cannot develop this point here and refer the reader to (Amsili, 1994).","(9) Aujourd'hui Pierre ne possbAe pas de voiture. ~ibday Pierre doesn't own a ear'."]},{"title":"4 Bottom-up construction","paragraphs":["We now integrate the semantics and the syntax of sentential negation.

DRtheoretic expressions are associated with leaves, and then combined to form the final DR,S. The combinatorial method used here is A-conversion, with two kinds of ~-expressions, namely predicative DRSs and partial DRSs. We associate verbs and nouns with 1)redicatiw~ DRSs (for instance, the verb voir (see)) yields Aa:ky voir(x,y)), the role of which is to introduce predicates into the representation. In constrast, discourse ret~rents are only present in the form of DR-variables; they will be introduced by the partial DRSs. The translation of noun phrases (NP) or determiners is quite close to that of the Montagovian tradi-tion. A determiner is associated with a partial DRS, which is, so to speak, what remains of a DRS when one takes away a predicative DRS. As a consequence, there will be variables over predicative DRSs (PDRS-variables) in partial DRSs. A partial DRS can also contain a declared discom'se referent. This discourse referent is meant to serve as an argument of the predicative DRS which will be assigned to one PDRS-wxriable during the conversion.
