This is one of the largest projects dealing with Machine Translation (MT) of spoken language. Approxinmtely 100 researchers in 29 public aad industrial institutions are involved. The application domain is spontaneous spoken language in face-to-face dialogs. The current scenario is restricted to the task of appointment scheduling and the languages involved are English, German and Japanese.","This article describes the realization of a transfer approach based on the proposals of (Abb and Buschbeck-Wolf, 1995; Caspari and Schmid, 1994) and (Copestake, 1995). Transfer-based MT 1, see e.g. (Vauquois and Boi~et, 1985; Nagao et al., 1985), is based on con~rastive bilingual corpus analyses from which a bilingual lexicon of transfer equivalences is derived. In contrast to a purely","*This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework of the Verbmobil project under grant 01 IV 101 U.

Rupp and our anonymous reviewers for usefltl feedback a~ld discussions on earlier drafts of the paper. The responsibility for the contents of this paper lies with the authors.","1For a more detailed overview of different approaches to MT, see e.g. (Hutchins and Solners, 1992). lexicalist approach which relates bags of lexical signs, as in Shake-and-Bake MT (Beaven, 1992; Whitelock, 1992), our transfer approach operates on the level of semantic representations produced by various analysis steps. The output of transfer is a semantic representation for the target language which is input to the generator and speech synthesis to produce the target language utterance. Our transfer equivalences abstract away from morpho-logical and syntactic idiosyncracies of source and target languages. The bilingual equivalences are described on the basis of semantic representations.","Since the Verbmobil domain is related to discourse rather than isolated sentences the model theoretic semantics is based on Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory, DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). In order to allow for underspecification, variants of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRS) (Reyle, 1993) are employed as semantic formalisms in the different analysis components (Bos et al., 1996; Egg and Lebeth, 1995; Copestake et al., 1995).","Together with other kinds of information, such as tense, aspect, prosody and morpho-syntax, the different semantic representations are mapped into a single multi-dimensional representation called Verbmobil Interface Term (VIT) (Dorna, 1996). This single information structure serves as input to semantic evaluation and transfer. The transfer output is also a VIT which is based on the semantics of the English grammar (el. Copestake et al. (1995)) and used for generation (see Kilger and Finkler (1995) for a description of the generation component).","Section 2 of this paper sketches the semantic representations we have used for transfer. In section 3 we introduce transfer rules and discuss examples. In section 4 we compare our approach with other MT approaches. In section 5 we present a summary of the implementation aspects. For a more detailed discussion of the implementation of the transfer formalism see Dorna and Emele (1996).

(Bos et al., 1996; Egg and Lebeth, 1995; Copestake et al., 1995). The ability to underspecify quantifier and operator scope together with certain lexical ambiguities is impof rant for a practical machine translation system like Verbmobil because it supports ambiguity preserving translations. The (lisambiguation of different readings couht require an m'bitrau'y amount of reasoning on real-world knowledge and thus should be avoided whenever possible.","In the following examples we assume an explicit event-based semantics (Dowry, 1989; Parsons, 1991) with a Neo-Davidsonian representation of semantic argument relations.

Hence the skolemization prevents unwanted unification of labels and markers while matching individual transfer rules against the semantic representation.","The general form of a transfer rule is given by","SLSem, SLConds Tau0p TLSem, TLConds. where SLSem and TLSem are sets of semantic entities. Tau0p is an operator indicating the intended application direction (one of <->,->, <-). SLeonds and TLConds are optional sets of SL and TL conditions, respectively. All sets are written as Prolog lists and optional conditions caa be omitted.","On the source language, the main difference between the SLSem and conditions is that the former is matched against the input and replaced by the TLSem, whereas conditions act as filters on the applicability of individual transfer rules without modifying the input representation. Hence conditions may be viewed as general inferences which yield either true or false depending on the context. The context might either be the local context as defined by the current VIT or the global context defined via the domain and dialog model. Those inferences might involve arbitrarily complex inferences like anaphora resolution or the determina-tion of the current dialog act. In an interactive system one could even imagine that conditions are posed as yes/no-questions to tile user to act as a negotiator (Kay et al, 1994) for choosing the most plausible translation.","K the translation rules in (3) are applied to the semantic input in (2a) they yield the semantic output in (2b). We restrict the following discussion to the direction from German to English but the rules can be applied in the other direction as well. (3) a. [L:echt(A)] <-> [L:real(h)].","b. [L: passen (E) ,L: arg3 (E,Y) ,LI : bei (E,X)] <->","[L:suit (E) ,L:arg2(E,X) ,L:arg3 (E,Y)].","c. [L:schlecht(E)], [Ll:passen(E)] <->","[L:neg(A),A:good(E)] .","d. [L:ich(X)] <-> [L:ego(X)].","e. [L:pron(X)] <-> [L:pron(X)]. The simple lexical transfer rule in (3a) relates the German intensifier echt with the English real 4. The:variables L and A ensure that the label and the argument of the German echt are assigned to the English predicate real, respectively.","The equivalence in (3b) relates the German predicate passen with the English predicate suit. The rule not only identifies the event marker E, but unifies the instances X and Y of the relevant thematic roles. Despite the fact that the German bei-phrase is analysed as an adjunct, it is treated exactly like the argument arg3 which is syntactically subcategorized. This rule shows how structural divergences can easily be handled within this approach.","4The semantic predicate real abstracts away from the adjective/adverbial distinction. (4) [L:passen(E), Ll:bei(E,X)] <->","[L: suit (E), L: arg2 (E,X)]. The rule in (3b) might be further abbreviated to (4) by leaving out the unmodified arg3, because it is handled by a single metarule, which passes on all semantic entities that are preserved between source and target representation. This also makes the rule for (3e) superfluous, since it uses an interlingua predicate for the anaphor in German and English.","The rule in (3c) illustrates how an additional condition (ILl :passen(E)]) might be used to trigger a specific translation of schleeht into not good in the context ofpassen. The standard trailslation of schlecht to bad is blocked for verbs like suit, that presuppose a positive attitude adverbial. 5 One main advantage of having such conditions is the preservation of the modularity of transfer equivalences because we do not have to specify the translation of the particular verb which only triggers the specific translation of the adverbial. Consequently, the transfer units remain small and independent of other elements, thus the in-terdependencies between different rules are vastly reduced. The handling of such rule interactions is known to be one of the major problems in scaling up MT systems.","A variation on example (1) is given in (5). (5) a. Das paflt mir echt schleeht.","b. That really doesn't suit me well. Tile translation is exactly the same, but tile German verb passen takes an indirect object mir instead of the adjunct be/-phrase in (1). The appropriate transfer rule looks like (6a) which can be reduced to (6b) because no argument switching takes place and we can use the metarule again.

In a purely monotonic system without overriding it would be possible to apply the transfer rule in (6b) to sentence (1) in addition to the rule in (4) leading to a wrong translation. Whereas in the underlying rule application scheme assumed here, the more general rule in (6b) will be blocked by the more specific rule in (4).","The specificity ordering of transfer rules is primarily defined in terms of the cardinality of matching subsets and by the subsumption order on terms. In addition, it also depends on the cardinality and complexity of conditions. For the passen example at hand, the number of matching predicates in the two competing transfer rules defines the degree of specificity.","~Instead of using a specific lexical item like passen the rule should be abstracted for a whole class of verbs with similar properties by using a type definition, e.g. type (de, pos_att itude_verbs, [gehen, passen .... ] ). For a description of type definitions see (11) below. 318","The following example illustrates how conditions are used to enforce selectional restrictions from the domain model. For example ~rmin in German might either be translal;ed as appointment or as date, depending on the context. (7) a. [L:termin(X)] <-> It:appointment(X)].","b. [L : terrain (X) ],","[sort(X)=<'temp_point] <-> [L:date(X)]. The second rule (7b) is more specific, because it uses an additional condition. This rule will be tried first by calling the external domain model R)r testing whe.ther the sort assigned to X is not suhsumed by the sort, letup_point. Here, the first rule (7a) serves as a kind of default with respect to the translation of Terrain, in cases where no specific sort information on the marker X is awfilable or the condition in rule (7b) Nils.","In (8), a light verb construction like einen Terminvorsehlag aachen is translated into su.qgest a date by decomposing the compound and light verb to a simplex verb and its modifying noun.

(1987), is the gain in modularity by allowing language independent grammar development. Translation equivalences relating semantic entities of the source and target grammars can be fi)mmlated in a grmnmar independent bilingual semantic lexicon. In cases where the semantic representations of source, and target language are not isomorphic, a nontrivial transfer relation between the two representations is needed. But it is cleat'ly much easier to niap between fiat semantic representations than between either syntact;ic trees or deeply nested semantic re, presentations","An inl;erlingua approadt presumes thai; a sire gle representation for arbitrat'y languages exists or can be developed.

This holds especially in the Verbmobil context with its distributed gratnmat- development.","Whereas our approach does not preclude the use of interlingua predicates.

Buschbeck-Wolf and Niibel (1995), it makes sense 1,o use inore abstract relations which express tim-dmnental relationships like temporal location or spatial location. Then it is left to the language specific grammars to make the right lexical choices.

(11b) and (11d) show possible German and English lexicalizations. (12) [temp_loc(E,X)] , [sort(X)=<time] <->","[temp loc(E,X)]. The interlingua rule in (12) identifies the abstract teinl)oral location predicates under the condition that the internal argument is more specitlc than the sort time. This condition is necessary because of the polysemy of those prepositions. Dur-ing comt)ilation the SL class definition will be automatically expanded to the individual predicates, whereas the TL class dclinition will be kept unexpanded such that the tat'get gratnmar might be able to choose one of the idiosyncratic prepositions. Mixed approaches like Kaptan et al. (1989) can be characterized by mapping syntax ,as well as a predicate-m'gument structure (f-structure). As 319 already pointed out, e.g. in (Sadler and Thompson, 1991), this kind of transfer has problems with its own multiple level mappings, e.g. handling of verb-adverb head switching, and does not cleanly separate monolingual from contrastive knowledge, either. In Kaplan and Wedekind (1993) an im-proved treatment of head switching is presented but it still remains a less general solution.","A semantic approach is much more independent of different syntactic analyses which axe the source of a lot of classical translation problems such as structural and categorial divergences and mismatches. In our approach grammars can be developed for each language independently of the transfer task and can therefore be reused in other applications.","At first glance, our approach is very similar to the semantic transfer approach presented in Alshawi et al. (1991). It, uses a level of underspecified senmntic representations as input and output of transfer. Tile main differences between out' approach and theirs are the use of flat semantic representations and tile non-recursive transfer rules. Tile set-oriented representation allows much simpler operations in transfer for accessing individual entities (set membership) and for combining the result of individual rules (set union). Furthermore, because the recursive rule application is not part of tile rules themselves, our approach solves problems with discontinuous translation equivalences which tile former approach cannot handle well. A transfer rule for such a case is given in (4).","Out\" current apt)roach is strongly related to tile Shake-and-Bake approach of Beaven (1992) and Whitclock (1992). But instead of using sets of lexical signs, i.e. morpho-syntactic lexemes as in Shake-and-Bake, we specify translation cquivalences on sets of arbitrary semantic entities. Therefore, before entering tile transfer component of our system, individual lexemcs can already be decoinposcd into sets of such entities, e.g. for stating generalizations on the lexical semantics level or providing suit-able representations for inferences. For example, the wh-question word when is decomposed into temp loc(E,X), whq(X,R), time(R,X) (lit.: at which time), hence no additional transfer rules are required. Similarly, German composita like Terminvorschlag axe decomposed into its compounds, e.g. termin(i2), n n(il,±2), vorschlag(il) where n_n denotes a generic noun-noun relation. As a result a compositional translation as proposal for a date is possible without stating any additional translation equivalences to the ones for the simplex nouns.","Another major difference is the addition of coilditions which trigger and block the applicability of individual transfer rules. For instance in the specific t,'anslation of schlecht to not good as defined in (3c), without conditions, one would have to add tile verb passen into the bag to test for such a specific context. As a consequence the translation of the verb needs to be reduplicated, whereas in our approach, the translation of the verb can be kept; totally independent of this specific translation of tile adverbial, because the condition functions merely as a test.","These examples also illustrates the usefulness of labeled conditions, because the negation operator can take such a label as an argument and we can use unification again to achieve the correct coindexation. If we would use a hierarchical semantics instead, as in the original Shake-and-Bake aproach, where the negation operator embeds the verb semantics we would have to translate schlecht (e), passen(e) into not(suit(e), well(e)) in one rule because there is no coindexation possible to express the correct embedding without the unique labeling of predicates.","Finally, we have filled the lack of an adequate control strategy for Shake-and-Bake by develop-ing a nonmonotonic control strategy which orders more specific rules before less specific ones. This strategy allows the specification of powerfifl de-fanlt translations. Whereas without; such an ordering special care is needed to prevent a compositional translation in cases where a more specific noncompositional translation also exists.","The same argument about control holds in comparison to the unification-based transfer approach on Mimimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1995; Copestake, 1995). In addition, we use matching on first order terms instead of feature structure unification. Full unification might be problematic because it is possible to add arbitrary information during rule application, e.g. by further unifying different arguments. The other main difference is our nonmonotonic control component whereas tile MRS approach assumes a monotonic computation of all possible transfer equiv'&lences which are then filtered by the generation grammar. It is difficult to judge the feasibility of their approach given the fact that only a limited coverage has been addressed so far."]},{"title":"5 Implementation","paragraphs":["A more detailed presentation of the implementation aspects of our transfer approach can be found in Dorna and Emele (1996). The current transfer implementation consists of a transfer rule compiler which takes a set of rules likc the one presented in section 3 and compiles them into two executable Prolog programs one for each translation direction. The compiled program includes the selection of rules, the control of rule applications and calls to external processes if necessary.","Because both the transfer input and the matching part of the rules consist of sets we can exploit ordered set operations during compilation as 320 well as at runtime to speed up the matching process and for computing common prefixes which axe shared between different rules.","The compiled trazlsfcr program is embcdded in the incremental and parallel axchitecture of the Verbmobil Prototype. Interaction with external modules, e.g. the domain model and dialog module or other inference components, is done via a set of predefined abstract interface functions whidl may be called in the condition part of transfer rules. The result is a hilly transpaxent and modulax interface for filtering the applicability of transfer rules. 6 Summary This pai)er presents a new declarative transfi'.r rule forlnalisin, which provides an iInplementation platform for a selnantic-based transfer approach.
