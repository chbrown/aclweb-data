Top level categories such as 'sentence,' 'subject,' etc. are syntaxbased, whereas lower-level categories such as 'ship_name,' 'time_expression,' etc. are semantics-based. The main advantage of adopting semantic categories is that we can easily specify the co-occurrence restrictions of head categories (e.g., the parse tree specifies that the category ships occurs with a small subset of nominal modifiers including uss which we call 'ship_mod'), and therefore reduces the ambiguity of the input sentence. In addition, it provides for easy access to the meaning of domain-specific expressions. The parse tree directly encodes the knowledge that sterett and kirov are ship names, ssn-12 a submarine name, and z stands for Greenwich Mean Time.","As for mapping from parse tree to semantic frame, we reduce all the major parse tree constituents into one of the three syntactic roles, i.e. clause, topic, and predicate. All clause-level categories including statements, infinitives, etc., are mapped onto clause. All noun phrases are mapped onto topic, and all modifiers as well as verb phrases are mapped onto predicate. However, there is no limit to the number of semantic frame categories, and we can easily create new categories for a more elaborate representation. In Figure 4, we have additional categories like 'time_expression.' Whether or not we add more categories to the semantic frame depends on how elaborate a translation output is desired. If elaborate translations are required, we increase the number of semantic frame categories. The flexibility of the semantic frame repre- ~I~ble 1: Sample English/Korean Bilingual Lexicon be V i ROOT i PRES i PAST iess V2 V ....

It is driven by three submodules: a lexicon, a set of message templates, and a set of rewrite rules. These modules are language-specific and external to the core generation system. Consequently, porting the generation system to a new language is confined to developing these submodules. ~ 2.2.1 Lexicon","Since the semantic frame uses English as its specification language, and is the basis for constructing the target language grammar and lexicon, entries in the lexicon contain words and concepts found in the semantic frame, expressed in English, with corresponding surface realization forms in Korean. A sample fragment of a bilingual lexicon is given in Table 1. 2.2.2 Message Templates","Message templates are target language grammar rules corresponding to the input sentence expressions represented in the semantic frame, For instance, the word order constraint of the target language is specified in this module. A set of message templates used to produce the Korean translation from the semantic frame in Figure 4 is given in Table 2.","5A pilot study of applying GENESIS to Korean language generation can be found in (Yang, 1995)."]},{"title":"706","paragraphs":["P~:EV pl-e acljtlnct ,~ull,leC t I gmt ttma ,i ahlp I num~P tc ~rnt us~i ;hi 9 ~laat I st~rlt L, rlc~, Full parse statement pan.rye vp_t ~ken urlt3op 1 i i-e, vtake under fll'~, v btl agarll: v v4tsh lr~tl'L,r,~rqt ' v..btj q_5hlD v M, lth q ~;h iF) ~h~ps r~h~p5","i shl 0 ~la~lo sLlbmtlrine nat.r, Figure 3: Parse 'lS:ee","{c stotement :time_expression {p numeric_time",":topic {q"]},{"title":"g~t :pred {p numeric :topic n19 } } :topic {q ship_home :hOme \"sterett\" :pred {p ship_mud :topic \"uss\" } }","paragraphs":[":subject I",":pred {p token under_fire :mode \"pp\" :pred {P v_.by",":topic {q ship_nnme",":nome \"kirov\" } }",":pred {p v uith",":topic {q subnorine_nome",":none \"ssn-12s\" } } } }","0UI9 z uss sterett token under fire by kirov ~ith ssn-12s","PAIIAPHP~SE: UI9 z USS Sterett token under fire by glrov uith SSH-12s","T~StmIO.: 8\"I l~ ~ *I~ \"I~ v ~I~oI el~-~l ~I~ ssn les~ Figure 4: Semantic Frame and qi'anslation r •"]},{"title":"Table 2: Smnple Message Fcmplates","paragraphs":["~~ statement topic predicate nl)-ship_mod ship_mud [ nt)-missih;-name missile_nante np-by np-with :topic i :predicate ta ~ntifier :noun_phrase :topic :predicate :topic :nounq)hrase :topic :topic noun_phrase :topic :topic ey ~,y :notn@~ :topic lo moun_phrase","Template (a) says that a statement consists of a subject tbtlowed by a verb phrase.

In English, the rewrite rules are used to generate the proper form of the indefinite article a or an. This module plays an important role in Korean due to m]- merous instances of phonologically conditioned allonmrphs in the language. For instance, the so-called nominative case marker is realized as i when the preceding morpheme ends with a consonant, and as ka when the preceding morpheme ends with a vowel, as illustrated below. Similarly, the so-called accusative case marker is realized as ul after a eonsonan% and as lul after a w)wel.","N~inative (2 as eT~d~:~'~t t-i v e~T], ~ a consonant j dOnll-/"]},{"title":"]","paragraphs":["John-u/ ) [ t~ouowlng:gv~l [ MariTk~ [ John-lul ]"]},{"title":"3 Data Summary","paragraphs":["Our source language text is called MUC-II data, and consists of naval operational report messages. 6 There are 1(}5 messages for system development and 40 messages set aside for system evaluation.

Concerning the problem involving mtknown constructions, we could easily generalize the gramram: to extend its coverage. However, both of these sohltions are t)roblematic. Ilandling the unknown word problem by increasing the size of the lexicon is not that straightforward given that most unknown words are open class items such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. In addition, one can not generMize the grammar without side effects. Due to the highly telegraphic nature of the MUC-II data, generMizing tile grammar will increase the ambiguity of an input sentence greatly, of. (Grishman, 1989). :) tIence, we need alternative solutions to deal with unknown words and unknown constructions. Tile most desirM3le solution is to (i) leave the current grammar intact since it eifieiently parses even highly telegral)hic messages, and (ii) tackle unknown words and unknown constructions by the same mechanism.","A potential solution to the unknown word problem is to:"]},{"title":"Do part of speeeh tagging and replace unknown words with their parts-of-speech, and bootstrap the parts-of:speech (in-stead of the actual words) to the analysis grammar.","paragraphs":["The unknown words would be replaced in the sentence string with their corresponding part-of-speech tag, and the semantk: grammar woukl be auginented to handle generic adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc., intermixed in the rules at appropriate positions.

The only difference between the two is that in one case (After Training I) we use a lexicon acquired fi'om the MUC-II database, and in the other case (After ~[¥ain-ing II) we use a lexicon acquired ffoin a combination of the BROWN CORPUS, the WALL STREET JOURNAL CORPUS, and the MUC-11 database.
