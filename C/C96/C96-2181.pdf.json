The architecture of NKRL","paragraphs":["NKRL is a two layer language.","The lower layer consists of a set of general tools which are structured into several integrated components, four in our case.","The descriptive component concerns the tools used to produce the formal representations (called predicative templates) of general classes of narrative events, like \"moving a generic object\", \"formulate a need\", \"be present somewhere\". Predicative templates are characterised by a threefold format, where the central piece is a semantic predicate (a primitive, like BEHAVE, EXPERIENCE, MOVE, PRODUCE etc.) whose arguments (role fillers) are introduced by roles as SUBJ(ect), OBJ(ect), SOURCE, DEST(ination), etc. ; the data structures proper to the descriptive component are then similar to the case-grammar structures. Templates are structured into a hierarchy, H TEMP(lates), corresponding, therefore, to a \"taxonomy of events\".","Templates' instances (predicative occurrences), i.e., the NKRL representation of single, specific events like \"Tomorrow, I will move the wardrobe\", \"Lucy was looking for a taxi\", \"Peter lives in Paris\", ,are in the domain of the factual component.","The definitional component supplies the NKRL representations, called concepts, of all the general notions, like"]},{"title":"physical_entity, human_being, taxi_, city_,","paragraphs":["etc., which can play the role of arguments within the data su'uctures of the two components above. The concepts correspond to sets or collections, organised according to a generalisation/specialisation (tangled) hier~chy which, for historical reasons, is called H_CLASS(es). The data structures used for the concepts are, substantially, frame-like structures ; H_CLASS corresponds relatively well, therefore, to the usual ontologies of terms.","The enumerative component of NKRL concerns the formal representation of the instances (concrete, countable ex,'unples, see lucy_, wardrobe_l, taxi_53) of the concepts of H CLASS ; their formal representations take the name of individuals.

By means of proper specialisation operations it is then possible to obtain, from the basic templates, the (specific) \"derived\" templates that could be concretely needed to implement a particular, practical application -- e.g., \"move an industrial process\" -- and the corresponding occurrences. In NKRL, the set of legal, basic templates can be considered, at least in a first approach, ,as fixed.","Analogously, the general concepts which pertain to the upper levels of H_CLASS -- such as"]},{"title":"human_being, physicalentity, modality_,","paragraphs":["etc. -- form a sort of upper-level, ilwariable ontology."]},{"title":"3.

For the determiners date-1 and date-2, see (Zarri, 1992a).","A MOVE consUuctiou like that of occurrence el (completive construction) is necessarily used to translate any event concerning the transmission of an information (\"...

For example, the eompletive construction can be used to deal with a problem originally raised by Naz,'u'enko (1992) in a conceptual graphs context, namely, that of the correct rendering of causal situations where the general framework of the m~tecedent consists of an (implicit) speech situation. Let us examine briefly one of the Nazarenko's exmnples (1992 : 881) : \"Peter has a lever since he is flushed\". As Naz~enko remarks, \"being flushed\" is not the \"cause\" of \"having a fever\", but that of an implicit enunciative situation where we claim (affirm, assert etc.) that someone has a fever.

Other modulators are the temporal modulators, \"begin\", \"end\", \"obs(erve)\", see also Fig. 2. Modulators work as global operators which take as their argument tile whole (predicative) template or occurrence. When a list of modulators is present, as in the occurrence c7 of Fig. 3, they apply successively to the template/occurrence in a polish notation style to avoid any possibility of scope ambiguity. In the standard constructions for expressing wishes, desires and intentions, tile absence of the \"ment(al)\" modulator in the BEHAVE occurrence meaus that tile SUBJ(ect) of BEHAVE takes some concrete initiative (acts explicitly) in order to fulfil the result ; if \"merit\" is present, as in Fig. 3, no concrete action is undertaken, and the \"result\" reflects only the wishes and desires of the SUBJ(ec0."]},{"title":"4. Inferences and NL processing","paragraphs":["Each of the four components of NKRL is characterised by the association with a class of basic inference procedures. For exmnple, the key inference mechanism for the factual component is the Filtering and Unification Module (FUM). The primary data structures handled by bq3M are the \"search patterns\" that represent the general properties of an information to be searched for, by filtering or unification, within a knowledge base of occun'ences. The most interesting component of tile FUM module is represented by the matching algorithm which unifies the complex structures -- like"]},{"title":"\"(SPECIF summoning_l (SPECIF board_meeting_l mediobanca_ special))\" in","paragraphs":["occurrence c2 of Fig. 1 -- that, in the NKRL terminology, are called \"structured arguments\". Structured arguments are built up in a principled way by making use of a specialised sub-language which includes four expansion operators, the \"disjunctive operator\", the \"distributive operator\", the \"collective operator\", and the \"attributive operator\" (SPECIFication), see (Zaxli, 1996) for more details.","The basic inference mechanisms call then be used as building blocks for implementing all sort of high level inference procedures. An example is given by the \"transformation rules\", see (Ogonowski, 1987). NKRL's transformations deal with the problem of obtaining a plausible answer from a database of factual occurrences also in the absence of the explicitly requested infommlion, by searching semantic affinities between what is requested and what is really present in file base. The fund,'unental principle employed is then to \"transform\" tile original query into one or more different queries which -- unlike \"trmisfonned\" queries in a database context -- are not strictly \"equivalent\" but only \"semantically closC' to the original one.","With respect now to the NL/NKRL translation procedures, they are based oil file well-known principle of locating, within the original texts, the syntactic and semantic indexes which can evoke the conceptual structures used to represent these texts. Our contribution has consisted in tile set up of a rigorous algorithmic procedure, centred around the two foUowing conceptual tools : • The use of rules -- evoked by particular lexical","items in the text exmnined and stored in proper","conceptual dictionaries -- which take the form of","generalised production rules. The left hand side","(,antecedent Par0 is always a syntactic condition,","expressed as a tree-like structure, which must be","unified with the results of tile general parse tree","produced by the syntactic specialist of the","translation system. If the unification succeeds, tile","right haud sides (consequent parts) ,are used, e.g., to","generate well-formed templates Ctriggering rules\"). • The use, within file rules, of clever mechanisms to","deal with the variables. For example, in the","specific, \"triggering\" f,'unily of NKRL rules, the","antecedent variables (a-variables) ,are first declared","in tile syntactic (antecedent) part of the rules, and","then \"echoed\" in tile consequent pro'is, where they","appear under the form of arguments and constraints","associated with the roles of the activated templates.","Theh\" function is that of \"capturing\" -- during the","match between file antecedents and the results of","the syntactic specialist -- NL or H_CLASS terms","to be then used as specialisation terms lot filling","up the activated templates and building the final","NKRL structures.","A detailed description of these tools can be found, e.g., in (Zarri, 1995) ; see also Azzmn (1995). Their generality and their precise formal scmautics make it possible, e.g., tile quickly production of useful sets of new rules by simply duplicating and editing the existing ones.","We reproduce now, Fig. 5, one of the several triggering rules to which tile lexical entry \"call\" -- pertaining to tile NL fragment examined at the beginning of Section 3. -- contains a pointer, i.e., one of tile rules corresponding to the meaning \"to issue a call to convene\". This rule allows the activation of a basic template (PRODUCE4.12) giving rise, at a later stage, to the occurrence c2 of Fig. 1 ; the x symbols in Fig. 5 correspond to a-variables.","We can remark that all the details of the full template are not actually stored in the consequent, given that the H TEMP hierarchy is part of the \"common shared data stmctmes\" used by the translator.
