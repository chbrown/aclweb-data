A parse tree is an ordered directed acyclic graph (DAG) satisfying the following constraints. 1. There is exactly one vertex without predeces-","sors, called the top vertex or root.

The idea of using context variat)les to represent ambiguous structures originally stems fl'om the literature on constraint-based formalisms (DSrre and Eisele, 1990). A packed UDRS is a quintuple < L,R,D,C',5> where L, R, < are the same as in UDRSs, D is a finite set of contexts which is disjoint from L and R. C' is defined as in UDRSs except that (1) any condition may 909 also be prefixed by a context set, and (2) label arguments may~ not, only be labels but also functions from contexts to labels (£ = L U (D --~ L)), and the same holds for discourse referents (7£ = RtA (D ~ R)). If a function {A ~ Xl,B ~ x2} replaces a discourse referent in a packed UDRS, this intuitively means that the argument slot is filled by xt in reading A and by x2 in reading B. As an example for a packed UDRS consider the following representation for I saw every man with a telescope.

Tile only semantic composition operation is concatenation. In addition labels and discourse referents are matched as specified in the semantic part; of the grammar rules (the \"semantic grammm'\"). In the semantic grmnnmr every nonterminal is assigned a list of arguments. For every operator (e.g. an NP) a lower label and a series of upper labels must be given. The lower label points to material which must be in the scope of the operator (e.g. tile verb). The upper labels refer to thc minimal scope domain tile operator must occur in. This domain differs for indefinite NPs and quantifier NPs since these types of NPs are subject to different island constraints (only indefinites can be raised over clause boundaries). Furthermore, the semantic grammar specifies the UDRS conditions introduced by lexical items and rules and determines the arguments to be matched in rules and lexical items. It also gives the direction of this matching by fixing in which lexical item an argument originates (see last slot of lcxical entries). If an argument originates in an item (becmlsc it is e.g. its instance discourse referent or label) then the value of this argument is unambigous for the item 2. In adjunct[on structures, the modified constituent assigns and the modifier receives the shared discourse referent.

MRS produces a spurious reading in which the PP with a telescope adjoins to the NP a man while the PP in the apartment modifies the hill sentence.

In the Core Language Engine approach to syntactic underspecification the representation must be un-packed to perform disambiguation by sorts. This seems to be true for any approach relying on delay of semantic construction operations: In order to apply the sortal restrictions of, e.g., a verb to one of its argument discourse referents it must be known which discourse referents could possibly fill the argument slot. Moore and Alshawi (AIshawl, 1992) explain their reluctance to apply sort restrictions already in the packed structure with the maintenance overhead in associating semantic records with vertices of the forest. In the packed UDRS approach the problem is handled by explicitly enumerating all possible readings. Then, the maintenance effort is reduced to the effort of extrapolating the tree readings from the parse forest. None of the compared approaches makes any claims about theorem proving and transfer. In the packed UDRS approach it is conceivable to delay actual disambiguation as long as possible: Apart from the potential representation of referen-tim ambiguities by functions packed UDRSs look exactly like UDRSs.
