Cases like (1) are generally taken to be prototypical: the present parti(:it)le marker indicates the progressive aspect, which says that sonto extended event with a recognisable end t)oint is in progress and will probably reach its conclusion.","(Asher, 1992) considers the circumstances under which (1) will lend you to conclude that Henrietta did indeed reach the far side of the road, arguing that this conclusion can only be reached by using a default inference rule which would be cancelled in cases like: 3 Ilcnrictta was crossing th, c wad, when sh, e was hit by a bus. I have. no argument with his analysis of (1) and (3). What concerns me here is the apparent change in the contribution of the present participle marker in (2). In (2) we have a (conceptually) instantaneous (',vent, namely a hiccup. Since hiccups are generally thought of as taking no time, it; is not possible~ to be in the middle of a single hiccup and hence we are solnehow driven to conelude that Harry was in the middle of a series of hiccut)s. A similar problem arises with: 4 Allan is living in Bray. Here we have a homogeneous state where there is no result to be achieved no interesting state of affairs that arises as a consequence of reaching the end point. As such the present participle cannot be taken as an indication that the cuhnination of my living in Bray has not been reached, since there is no such cuhnination to reach. In this ease the present l)artieiple somehow transforms itself to an indicator of temporariness, so that you {:an gel; exchanges like the following: Allan's living in Bray I thought he lived in Buxton .... Yes, but he's on a visit to Ireland at the inoInent (Smith, 19911) deals with this phenomenon by appealing to a notion of \"derived interpretations\", though with very little discussion of how the derivations take place. (MoSns and Steedman, 1988) deal with it by invoking a process of coercion which changes the meaning of the ast)ect markers as required by the properties of the verb to which they are attaehe(t. Much of what I want to say below follows their anMysis, with one m~> jor difference.. Coercion changes tile meaning of the aspectual marker in response to the semmltic properties of the marked verb. But if items are allowed to change their meanings as a consequence of the semantic properties of other items then the principle of compositionality that \"the mealfing of the whole is made out of simple l","(:onlbinations of the meanings of the parts\"","t If we alh)w arbitrary rules of combination then we (:an include rules which make arbitrary changes 889 becomes rather ineffectual. We are, alter all, led to describe a word as being a homonym in exactly those cases where the meaning of what appears to be a single lexical item depends on the semantic properties of the words it is being combined with. In 5 IIe keeps his money tied up in the bank. 6 He keeps his boat tied up by the bank. the fact; that; the interpretation of bank depends on the semantic properties of money and boat is what; persuades us that the form bank is being used to realise two diffe.rent lexical items. We do not, however, want to describe the present participle marker as being ambiguous, with different interpretations which depend on the semantic context in which it occurs, unless we are absolutely forced to. The analysis in this paper attempts to show that the effects described by Mogns and Steedman (:an be achieved without any meaning-changing operations or unwanted ambiguities.","The basic tool that I will use is the observation that A U F ~ A can hold when neither A ~ A nor ]7' ~ A does, and ill particular that if P and F' are different then A U F ~ A and A U P' ~ A' can hold where A and A' are different, or even incompatible. If we back ut) the labels representing lexical and predexical items with appropriate sets of meaning postulates then we may well find that different things can be inferred from a single itein in different semantic contexts without being forced to conclude that those items themselves mean different things. In this way the meanings of words will cooperate to convey more complex inessages than each can carry alone."]},{"title":"2 Meaning Postulates","paragraphs":["Consider tile following analysis of 7 Harry was hiccupping ,.A::{ (subset(A, .[ B, name(B, Harry)])"]},{"title":"A IAI = i)}","paragraphs":["~C :: {past( C) } prog( C,"]},{"title":"• IV, (vati ,,,t(D, A)","paragraphs":["A event(D)"]},{"title":"A tvp (D,","paragraphs":["This 2 a is all very well as far as it goes, but unless the consequences of saying that something is an to the meanings of the parts.

MP prog says in each case that there must be an event whose start point is before now and an event which does not have an end point, before now. In the case of (8) this is compatible with the possibility of there being exactly one such event. Indeed, since only one peach is involved, the remainder of the MP for eat '(which would include the information that you can only eat something once) would presumably force this conclusion. It is further-more compatible with the requirement that there should be an event whose start is before t and an event, whose, end is not before t, since eating events are extended - if they have end points then these are after their start points. In the case of (7) it is not, possible for there to be a single event, since the start and end points of a single hiccup are taken to occur with no intervening instant. We therefore find that (7) must denote a set of hiccups, simply by inspecting the MPs and without resorting to a process which turns hiccupping from an instantaneous act to a homogeneous sequence of acts. In both cases, the sentence reports a sequence of events. But in (8) there is nothing to say that this sequence has more than one member, and the fact that only on(; peach is involved suggests that it has exactly one member; whereas in (7) the temporal properties of the conceptually instantaneous act of hiccupping mean that there must be more than one such event.

Assuming that live denotes a state, we need to look at the interactions between the MP for the progressive aspect and the MP for the ak-tionsart state. MP state says that the characteristic property of the state is true of its patient throughout some interval, but unlike MP relic-event it says nothing about the start and end points of that state, not even whether or not they exist. Of course in general we know that most states do have start and end points, but in many cases that is all we know about them. A speaker who is committed to the existence of a state, then, may not be concerned about the existence of the start or end point of that state they may not know when it started, they may not care whether it has ended, as far as they are concerned it may have been going on since the beginning of time and it; may continue to the emt of time. If, however, their report of tiffs state invokes the progressive aspect then they do become committed to know-ing something about the start and end dates. If, for instance, we were considering Allan was living in Bray rather than Allan is living in Bray then we would assume that the speaker knew enough about the end of this state to place it before the reference point marked by the past tense of the auxiliary. Thus the use of the progressive aspect here commits the speaker to the existence of an end date for the state in a way in which commitment to the existence of tile state does not: it is this that gives (4) its feeling of being about a temporary state of atfairs 4. We now turn to the simple aspect. Consider the following pair of sentences: 9 Allan lives in Bray. 10 Mary eats a peach for her\" lunch. (9) describes a simple homogeneous state of affairs.

In the approach outlined here, every sentence reports a set of events. Aspect, ak-tionsart and temporal modeifiers then provide information which can be used to determine the cardinality of this set and to draw other conclusions about its temporal characteristics. Each component of the report is allowed to make a very weak contribution, and then the interactions between these contributions construct a larger, and more subtle, set, of conclusions. The fact that most sentences report singleton sets of events arises, in the absence of information to the contrary, by a process of implicature, though the adverb once is available to reinforce this conclusion if necessary.","i have only dealt with a small subset of the relevant phenomena here. It seemed better to use the space available to explore a small number of cases in some detail than to cover a wider range without being convincing about any particular case.
