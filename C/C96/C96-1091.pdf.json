Hence we can see that we have already gained the key benefit of a chart approach for PSG parsing, nanmly avoiding the need to recompute partial results. It can be seen that indexing in the above method plays a role sinfilar to that of 'spans' within standard (:hart parsing.","An adequate algorithm for use with the above approach is easily stated. Given a possible theorem Br,... ,Bn => A, tire left hand side formulae are each assigned unique indices and semantic variables, and t)ul; on ail agenda. Then, a loop is followed in which a formula is .taken from the agenda and added to the database, and then the next formula is taken from the agenda and so on until the agenda is empty.

When the agenda is empty, a check is made for any successful overall analsyses, identified as described above. Note that since the result of a combination always bears an index set larger than either of its parent formulae, and since the maximal index set that any fornmla c~n carry includes all and only the indices assigned to the original left hand side formulae, the above process nmst terminate. Higher-Order Linear Deduction I,et us turn now to the general case, where higher-order formulae are allowed. The method to be described involves compiling tile initial formulae (which may be higher-order) to give a new, possibly larger, set; of formulae which arc; all tirst order. We observed above how hypothetical reasoning in a proof is driven by the presence within higher-order fornuflae of positively occurring subforinu-539 lae. The compilation inethod involves identify-ing and excising such subformulae (thereby simplifying the containing formulae) and including them as additional assumptions. For example, this method will simplify the higher-order formula Xo-(Yo-Z) to become Xo--Y, generating an additional assumption of Z. The two key challenges for such an approach are firstly ensuring that the additional assumptions are appropriately used (otherwise invalid reasoning will follow), and secondly ensuring that a proof term appropriate to the original type combination is returned.","Consider an attempt to prove the (invalid) type combination: Xo-Zo-(Yo-Z), Y => X. Compilation of the tbrmula Xo-Zo-(yo-Z) yiehls two formulae Xo--Zo-Y and Z, so tile initial query be-comes Xo-Zo-Y, Z, Y => X, which is provable. The problem arises due to inappropriate use of the additional formula Z, which should only be used to prove the argument Y (just as Z's role wouhl be to contribute to proving the argument Yo-Z in a standard proof involving the original formula Xo-Zo-(Yo--Z)). The solution to this problem relies upon the indexing method adopted above. The additional assumption generated in compiling a higher-order formula such as Xo--(yo-Z) will it-self be marked with a unique index.

The translation functions are identity functions on atomic formulae, and for complex formulae are defined mutually as follows (where each superscript p stands for one of the functions, with i0 indicating the complementary function to p):","i - k : B p o- i - j : A ~ where i is a new","variable/constant j - k : A\\B p as p is +/-","i - k : B p o-- j - k : A p where k is a new variable/constant aspis +/- i -j :B/AV A sequent B1, •. •,/3n =~ A is translated as: O-l:Bl+,...,(n-1)-n:B + ~ O-n:A-For example, X/(Y/Z), Y/W, W/Z ::> X translates to give the following linear formulae (where i,j, 1 are variables, and k a constant):","Database: (0 - i:X)o-((2 - k:Y)o-(i - k:Z))","(1 - j:Y)o-(2 - j:W)","(2 - l:W)o-(3 - I:Z)","Goal: (0 - 3:X)","Such linear formulae can be used with any linear deduction method, given the (trivial) additional task of unifying variables and constants in the string position labels. Note that for cases that are not L valid, but where the translation is linear logically valid, deduction will fail due to unification failure for string position labels. A minor complication arises for using this approach with the compilation-chart method described above. For example, the higher-order formula would compile to two indexed formulae:","a:(0 - i:X)o-(2 - k:Y):Ay.x(Az.y)","b:(i - k:Z):z Note that the string position variable i appears in both resulting formulae. For an overall deduction employing these two formulae to be correct, the binding of the two instances of i must be consistent. However, we cannot simply employ a global binding context since the chart method should be able to return alternative proofs of the same theorem, and such alternative proofs will typically induce distinct (but internally consistent) bindings over string position variables. Variable bindings must instead be handled locally, i.e. each formula in the database will carry with it a context indicating bindings that have been made in its derivation. Where two formula are combined, their contexts are merged (and must be consistent)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["van Benthem, J. 1991.
