This paper only considers ruh' based approaches to this problem.","Bag generation has received particulm: atten-tion in lexicalist approaches to MT, as exemplitied by Shake-and-Bake generation (Beaven, 1992; Whitelock, 1994).

Assume that the next wfss to be constructed by the generator is the NP 'the dog'. Given the grammar in Figure 1, it is possible to deduce that 'brown' can never be part of a complete NP constructed from such a substring. This can be determined as follows. If this adjective were part of such a sentence, 'brown' would have to appear as a leaf in some constituent that combines with 'the dog' or with a constituent containing 'the dog'. From the grammar, the only constituents that can combine with 'dog' are VP, Vtra and P. However, none of these constituents can have 'brownl' as a leaf: ill the case of P and Vtra this is trivial, since they are both categories of a ditferent lexical type. In the case of the VP, 'brownl' cannot appear as a leaf either because expansions of the VP are restricted to NP complements with 2 as their semantic index, which in turn would also require adjectives within them to }lave this index. l,'urthermore, 'brown1' cannot OCCUr as a loaf in a deel)er constituent in the VP t)ecause such an occurrence would be associated with a different index. In such cases 'brown' would modify a different noun with a different index: Ex. a { the], dog] , withl ,2 , the~ , lnvwn2 , collar2}","A naive implementation of this deduction would attempt to expand the VP depth-ill'st, left to right, ill order to accommodate 'brown' in a complete derivation. Since this would not be possible, the NP 'the dog' would be discarded. This approach is grossly inefficient however. What is required is a more tractable algorithm which, given a wfss and its associated sign, will be able to determine whether all remaining lexical elements can ever form part of a complete sentence which includes that wfss.","Note that deciding whether a lexical sign can appear outside a phrase is determined purely by the grammar, and not by whether the lexical elements share the same index or not. Thus, a more complex grammar would allow 'the man' from the bag Ex. 4 {thel,manl,shaves<l,],himselfl} even though 'himself' has the same index as 'the IIlan'. 3.2 Outer Domains The approach introduced here compiles the relevant information of[line fi'om the grammar and uses it to check for connectivity during bag generation. The compilation process results in a set of (Sign,Lex,Bindings) triples called outer domains. 'l'his set is based on a unification-based phrase structure grammar defined as follows: Definition 2 d grammar is a tuple (N, 7;P,S), where P is a sct of productions ce ~ /3, a is a sign, /3 is a list of signs, N is the set of all ee, T is the set of all signs appearing as elements of [3 which unify with lexical entries, and S is the start sign. Outer domains are defined as follow: Definition 3 {(Sign, Lcx, Binds) I Sign C N tO T, Lcx ~ T and there exists a derivation Oe ~ /31Signt /32 LeJ /33 or a ~ f11Lez] /32,S'iqnl /33, and Sign' a unifier for Sign, Lez j a unifier for Lcx, and Binds the set of all path pairs <SignPath, LexPalh> such thai Sign':SignPath is Ioken identical with LezS :LexPath} Intuitively, the outer domains indicate that preterminal category Lex ('an appear in a complete sentence with subconstituent Sign, such that l,cx is not a leaf of Sign. Using ideas from data flow analysis (Kennedy, 1981), predictive parser constructions (Aho et al., 1986) and feature grammar compilation (Trujillo, 1994) it is possible to construct such a set of triples. Outer domains thus represent elements whi(:h may lie outside a subtree of category Sign in a complete sentential 103 they would be indicated through paths such as SYNSEM :LOCAL:CONTI,INT:INI) EX.","'[b ensure that only connected lexical signs are generated and analysed, the following assumt)tion must also be made: Assumption 3 A grammar will only generate or analyse connected lexical signs. 2 Bag Generation Algorithms Two main tyl)es of rule-based bag generators have been proposed. The first type consists of a parser suitably relaxed to take into account the unordered character of tile input (Whitelock, 1994; Popowich, 1995; Trujillo, 1995). For example, in generators based on a chart 1)arser, the hm(tanmntal rule is applie(1 only when the edges to be ('ombined share no ]exical leaves, in contrast to requiring that the two edges have source and target nodes in common. The other type of generator applies a greedy algorithm to an initial solution in order Co find a grammatical sentence (1)oznafiski et al., 1.995). 2.1 Redundancy in Bag Generation One disadvantage with the above generators is that they construct a nnnd)er of strnctures which need Dot have been computed at all. In buihl-- ing these structures, the generator is e[fcctively searching branches of the search space which never lead to a COml)lete sentence.

Now, either W includes all the input elements as leaves, in which case W constitutes a complete sentence, or there are elements in the input bag which are not part of W. In the latter case, for bags obeying Assmnption 2, the following condition holds for any W that can form part of a complete sentence: Condition 1 Let L be the set of leaves appearing in W, let a be the .graph (V, Fd, where V : {C3 U B- L, and E-- { {x,y} ] x,y 6 Vand y is in the outer domain of x}.
