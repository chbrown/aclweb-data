This difficulty is more marked in Japanese than in English, since there are more syntactically ambiguous structures in Japanese. Tile Japanese language has few syntactic indicators for dividing sentences into phrases or clauses, unlike English with its relative pronouns and subordinate conjunctions. One of the most critical features of Japanese is that the difference between a phra~se and a clause is not cleat'. Even subjects or other obligatory elements of clauses are omitted very often when they aye indicated by contexts. In addition, the Japanese language does not have any parts of speech to clearly indicate either the beginning or end of a phrase or a clause. Another critical feature is that the Japanese language is an almost pure Head-final language, i.e., predicates and function words to signify the sentence structure appear at the end of the clause or sentence. This means that it is syntactically possible for all phrases or clauses that can modit) predicates to modify all other phrases or clauses that appear in the latter part of long sentences.","These syntactic characteristics of the Japanese language make it difficult to determine the dependency (modification) structure of hmg sentences. Simple parsing of Japanese long sentences inevitably produces a huge number of possible modification structures. A conventional bottom-up parsing method can reduce ambiguity in modification by local information in tim surface structure. However, this inclines toward an improper output, since the locally highest likelihood is sometimes low on the whole.","To overcome this problem, several methods to predict the global structure of long sentences have been proposed. One is a top-down parsing method by matching the input sentence and the domain-specific patterns (Furuse et al., 1992). Improvements made by other researchers enabled this method to parse irregular, incomplete and multiplex patterns, by describing the domain-dependent patterns in the form of grammar (Doi, Muraki, et M., 1993).","Another method employs global structure presumption to divide a sentence into clauses by utilizing general lexical information. It predicts the sentence structure prior to syntactic analysis only by utilizing domain-independent lexical information such as conjunctive particles, parallel expressions, theme transi-tion, etc. (Mizuno et al., 1990; Kurohashi et al., 1992).","Lexical Discourse Grammar (LDG) is one of the approaches with which a global structure of a long sentence is presumed by focusing on function words (Kamei et al, 1986; Doi et al., 1991).

From the parsing viewpoint, this suggests that each conjunctive particle has modification preference with certain predicates or auxiliary verbs.","From the viewpoint of modality, there are four predicate types in Japanese; (1) Auxiliary verbs of the first-type modality (conjecture etc.), (2) Auxiliary verbs of the second-type modality (necessity etc.), (3) Copula, and (4) Plain (present and past tense) forms of Verbs. Here, first-type modality includes conjecture, such as \"darou\"(f2\"7~ \")) which corresponds to 'may,' 'can,' 'maybe,' and 'possibly' in English auxiliary verbs, ad-verbs, and adjectives. Second-type modality includes necessity, such as \"nakereba-naranai\" (re t~ fc t:ft3 6 to¢ u,) and \"ta-hou-ga-yoi\"(t: t! \") ~3: u~) which correspond to 'have to' or 'must,' and 'had better,' 'should,' or 'preferably' in English. The Japanese Copula \"da\" (?Z) or \"desu\" (~¢'Y) means definition or speaker's judgment with confidence. Phdn forms of verbs are the present or past tense forms of verbs without any modal auxiliary verbs. These forms do not have any modal morpheme, but when they which appear at the end of the sentence and are followed by a period they CAN convey modality, that is, attitudes or intentions of the subject or speaker. Plain forms of verbs in a relative clause which modify a nominal phrase do not have such modMity.","LDG assumes that each conjunctive particle has a preference in modifying predicates or auxiliary verbs with consistent modMity. There are six levels of modality in conjunctive particles, and there are four types of modality in predicates, as mentioned above. A subordinate clause with modality modifies a consistent modality predicate type. The following figure illustrates the modality consistency between particles and auxiliary verbs in Japanese sentences.","{Clause + particle} Modality","{Clause + auxiliary verb} Modality","Take the Japanese conjunction noun \"toki\" (1~ = when, if) for example. This word corresponds to either the English conjunction 'when' with neutral reading or 'if' with conjecture modality. When the word \"toki\" is used as the 'if' reading, this word modifies a clause in which the modality is expressed. In most cases, auxiliary verbs such as \"darou\""]},{"title":"(?Z,5","paragraphs":["\") = may, maybe) or \"ta-hou-ga-yoi\"(t~ It 5 7~3: ~ = had better, should, preferably) express the modality of the modifee clause. The Japanese language has some words that indicate or emphasize the fact that the word \"toki\" is being used as the \"if\" reading. One of them is the adverb \"moshi\" (~o L) that indicates a supposition reading is applicable. This adverb is never used by itself and always modifies conjunctive forms such as \"toki,\" \"nara,\" \"to,\" and so on, and selects or emphasizes the supposition reading of the conjunctive forms. Another such word is the particle \"w£' (~:t) , which is usually used as a topic marker for a sentence. When \"wa\" is attached to \"toki,\" that is, in the form of \"toki-wa,\" the supposition reading is enhanced. This tendency is strengthened by the use of comma after the phrase \"toki-wa.\" The phrase \"toki-w£' tends to be used to modify phrases with auxiliary verbs of modality.","When this phrase with modality modifies a plain form of a verb with a period at the end of the sentence, the readers recognize that the plain form of the verb contains a kind of modality, such as the subject's or speaker's intention. In other words, modality information of the subordinate clauses is attached to the plain form of the main verb.

One example is prosodic information (Dorffner et al., 1990; Iwata et al., 1990; Kaiki et al., 1990; Sakai et al., 1990). If the correct sentence structure is acquired for each input sentence, prosodic information can be accurately calculated. As yet, even the most up-to-date, advanced systems have not achieved the analysis in the deep structure, therefore sentence structure presumption in the surface structure is essentiM for a robust prosodic control system. LDG meets this requirement since it presumes the sentence structure by means of function words occurring on the surface (Doi, Kamei, et al., 1993).

This tendency basically does not depend on whether or not a comma exists after the words. However, for words with a comma (marked with black bars in Fig. 2) pause length of Lev. 3 is shorter than that of Lev. 4. We suppose that the reason for this phenomenon is that a comma adds modality to the words and length-ens the pauses, as described in the previous section.

This model assumes that Japanese conjunctive particles convey modality, and modality structure can basically be detected by lexical information. We assign a ~conjunction level' to each conjunctive particle and reduce the number of possible syntactic structures of Japanese long sentences. In addition, we assume that all conjunctive particles have a modification preference according to their modality. This preference assigns priorities to the possible structures of tile sentences.","We applied LDG to a prosodic information control method in a Japanese text-to-speech conversion system to confirm the conjunction level experimentally. This method controls pause location and length in speech synthesis with the conjunction level in LDG, using only lexical information with no need fi~r syntactic analysis. Even so, it can tune tile pause length more finely than methods without sentence structure presumption. AnMyzing speech data, we confirmed a correlation between the level of a function word and the length of a pause inserted ai'~er that word. We are now in the process of developing a speech synthesis system with this method, by defining the default pause length for each conjunction level. In future research, LDG will also be applied to other prosodic information (rhythm and intonation).","There can be little doubt that LDG will be more etfective when two or nmre conjunct equivalents of different levels appear in one sentence, since the LDG conjunction levels are closely related to the inter-clausal dependency. Unfortur~ately there were few such cases in the data used in this paper. In future work, we will collect such data to proove this hypothesis, in so doing will refine our method to improveits ability to analyze long Japanese sentences."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] S.
