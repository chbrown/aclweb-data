At present the JE system has about a 5,000-word vocabulary and a transfer knowledge from 2,000 training sentences. The JK system is half this size. While some modules, such as morphological analysis and generation, are language-specific, the transfer module is a common part of every language pair. Through JE and JK implementation, we believe that the translation of every language pair can be achieved in the same framework using TDMT. On the other hand, it has turned out that the linguistic distance between source and target languages reflects the variety of target expression patterns in the transfer knowledge. Table 1 shows the number of target expression patterns corresponding a Japanese particles in JE and JK. These numbers are counted from the current TDMT system's transfer knowledge, and the numbers of examples are token numbers (i.e., not including duplications). 5 Discussion 5.1 Integration of Speech and Language A mechanism for spontaneous speech translation must be consistent with a mechanism for handling associative knowledge, such as translation usage examples and word co-occurrence information for rnemory-b~ed processing, and with a mechanism for logical structure analysis according to detailed rules for each processing phase in the Transfer-Driven MT processing. Under the process, a study should be carried out on building a stochastic language model using both syntactic and semantic information for speech understanding. 5.2 Related Research On the other hand, some studies hope to build spoken language translation systems using a certain interlingua method. A semantic parser is a typical example of this method. In particular, \"semantic pattern based parsing\" in JANUS, CMU's speech to speech translation system [Woszczyna93, Levin95] uses frame based semantics with a semantic phrase grammar and the operation of the parser is viewed as \"phrase spotting.\" Another one is MIT's multilingual 1076 'Fable 1: Japanese particle translation in JE and ,IK translation Japanese Pattern X w(J Y Xga Y Xno Y XoY Xni Y Xde Y","JP","Example Target patterns 224 30 140 15 226 36 147 15 154 22 120 25","Example Target patterns 66 1 40 1 88 2 41 1 55 5 33 5 GALAXY: a human-language interface to on-line travel information [Goddean94]. The system makes use of 'semantic frame representation' so as to paraphrase a recognized speech input utterance into a concrete and simple expression that contbrms with one of the system's internal representations and makes the utterance meaning easy to handle. Itowever, in extracting the meaning of an inlmt sentence, many default values are required so as to execute heuristic inferences. The inference is too powerful in explaining a speaker's intention and the propositional content of the utterance by one key word or phrase. Such a method may work well in a certain domain, but less scalability may be revealed when making a larger prototype system.","VERBMOBIL is a typical translation system for face-to:face dialogue [Wahlster93]. This system adopts English as a dialogue language for human-machine interface and makes use of DRT-based semantic representation units. 6 Conclusion '['DMT has been proposed as a general technique for spoken-language translation. We have applied TDMT to two language pairs, i.e., Japanese-English, and Japanese-Korean, as a first step to-ward multi-lingual translation. Also, we are planning to integrate speech recognition with TI)M'F for achieving effective and efficient speech translation.
