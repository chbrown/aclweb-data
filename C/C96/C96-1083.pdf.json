Name@der. edfgdf, fr Abstract When trying to identify essential concepts and relationships in a medium-size corpus, it is not always possible to rely on statistical methods, as the frequencies are too low. We present an alternative method, symbolic, based on the simplification of parse trees. We discuss the resuits on nominal phrases of two technical corpora, analyzed by two different robust parsers used for terminology updating in an industrial company. We compare our results with Hindle's scores of similarity. Subjects Clustering, ontology development, robust parsing, knowledge acquisition from corpora, computational terminology","1 Identifying word classes in medium-size corpora In companies with a wide range of activities, such as EDF, the French electricity company, the rapid evolution of technical domains, the huge amount of textual data involved, its variation in length and style imply building or updating numerous terminologies as NLP resources. In this context, terminology acquisition is defined as a twofold process. On one hand, a terminologist must identify the essential entities of the domain and their relationships, that is its ontology. On the other hand, (s)he must relate these entities and relationships to their linguistic realizations, so as to isolate the lexical entries to be considered as certified terms for the domain.","In this paper, we concentrate on the first is-sue. Automatic exploration of a sublanguage corpus constitutes a first step towards identifying the semantic classes and relationships which are relevant for this sublanguage.","In the past five years, important research on the automatic acquisition of word classes based on lexical distribution has been published (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Grei~nstette, 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994). Most of these approaches, however, need large or even very large corpora in order for word classes to be discovered 1 whereas it is often the case that the data to be processed are insufficient to provide reliable lexical intbrmation. In other words, it is not always possible to resort to statistical methods. On the other hand, medium size corpora (between 100,000 and 500,000 words: typically a reference manual) are already too complex and too long to rely on reading only, even with concordances. For this range of corpora, a pure symbolic approach, which recycles and simplifies analyses produced by robust parsers in order to classify words, offers a viable alternative to statistical methods. We present this approach in section 2. Section 3 de-scribes the results on two technical corpora with two different robust parsers. Section 4 compares our results to Itindle's ones (Hindle, 1990).","2 Simplifying parse trees to classify words","2.1 The need for normalized syntactic contexts","As Hindle's work proves it, among others (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Grefenstette, 1994:), the mere existence of robust syntactic parsers makes it possible to parse large corpora in order to automate the discovery of syntactic patterns in the spirit of Harris's distributional hypothesis. Itowever, Harris' methodology implies also to simplify and transform each parse tree 2 , so as to obtain so-called \"elementary sentences\" exhibiting the main conceptual classes for the domain (Sager","lIa'or instance, Hindle (Hindle, 1990) needs a six million word corpus in order to extract noun similarities from predicate-argunlent structures.","2Changing passive into active sentences, using a verb instead of a nominalization, and so on. 490 NP] NPa AP4"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["Nr As"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["stenose serre NPo"]},{"title":"PP2 Pa NP6 I","paragraphs":["de D9 NPlo le NPll AP12"]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["NPla AP14 A15"]},{"title":"I I I","paragraphs":["N~ A~r gauche"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["tronc eorninun I?igure 1: Parse tree for stenose serre de le hone commun gauche et al., 1987).","In order to ~mtomate this normalization, we propose to post-process parse trees so as to emphasize the dependency relationships among the content words and to infer semantic classes. Our approach can be opposed to the a prior one which consists in building simplified representations while parsing (Basili et al., 1994; Metzler and Haas, 1989; Smeaton and Sheridan, 19911).","2.2 R.ecycling the results of robust parsers For the sake of reusability, we chose to add a generic post-processing treatment to the results of robust parsers. It ilnplies to transduce the trees resulting fl:om different parsers to a common for-nlat.","We experimented so t~r two parsers: Aleth- (h:am and I,exl;er, which are being used at DER-EDI,' for terminology acquisition and updating. They both analyze corpora of arbitrary length. AlethGram has been developped winthin the GIIAAL project a. I,EXrI'ER has been developped at DER-EI)F (Bourigault, 1993). In this experinlent, we if)cussed on noun phrases, as they are central in most terminologies."]},{"title":"2.3 The simplification algorithm","paragraphs":["The objective is then to reduce automatically the numerous and complex nominal phrases provided by AlethGram and LEXTEI{ to elementary trees,","3The Eureka GRAAL project gathers in France (IC1-F, RLI (prime contractor), EDF, Aerospatiale and l{enanlt. which more readily exhibit the flmdamental binary relations , and to classify words with respect to these simplified trees.","For instance, from the parse tree for slenose serve de le tronc eommun gauche 4 (cf. fig. 2, in which non terminal nodes are indexed for reference purposes), the algorithm 5 yields the set of elementary trees of figure 1. 'l'he trees a and c correspond to contiguous words in the original sequence, whereas b and d only appear after modifier removal (see below).","Two types of simplifications are applied when possible to a given tree:","1. ,5'plitting: Each sub-tree immediately dominated by the root is extracted and possibly further simplified. For instance, removing node NP0 yields two sub-trees: NP], which is elementary (see below) and PP2, which needs further simplification.","2.

The subgraph of the chirurgical acts words, which is easy to identify from the SYCLADE graph (fig. 5a), is split in different parts in the similarity graph (fig. 5b).

The graph enables to distinguish the various meanings of words, a crucial feature in the ontological perspective since the meaning level is closer to the concept level than the word level. In addition, the results are clear and more easily interpretable than those given by a statistical method, because the reader does not have to supply the explanation as to why and how the words are similar.","The building of an ontology, which is a timeconsuming task and which cannot be achieved automatically, can nevertheless be guided.
