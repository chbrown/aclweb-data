Lexical rules (henceibrth: LRs) have been subjected to particularly close s<:rutiny. 'Fhis research has tbcused on two important issues: 1. how the use of LRs affects the generative power of grammar formalisms and the computational complexity of parsing algorithms (Uszkoreit and Peters 1986, Carpenter 1991), and 2. how to provide a denotational semantics for LRs (Calcagno and PoP lard 1995, Meurers 1995).
