Consider the example of a chiht who is using a nnlltinmdia encyclopedia system whicls provides a, mix of speech recognition (and language processing) and a. mouse. The chiht states \"Ca.n this, do this,\" pointing at a picture on the screen and clicking the mouse during the first %his\" and then choosing all itmn front a lllelltl during the second.

In tile object-.orienCed metaphor, some sort of centraJ application object is in cha.rge, and must send messages to the screeu, the mouse, and the voice system asldng for input upon activation.

This can be arbitrarily hard, especially as we consider that the number of utodalities wi]l keep grow-ing as user interface technology design comin ues. Even R)r this simple example the same query can be a.sked many ways: the child could speak \"can a. ptera.smdon fly?\"; could choose from the menu aquery-I)utcCion,\" point at the dinosaur, and then mouse \"fly\"; could type t.o a. conmm.ml lilac \"query:flmction PT1) Fly\"; or any other COllll>i-im.tion of these capal>ilities.
