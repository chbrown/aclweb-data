The structure alignment can be used to support machine translation and cross language information retrieval by providing extended phrase translation lexicon and translation templates."," The popular methods for structure alignment try to align hierarchical structures like sub-trees with parsing technology. However, the alignment accuracy cannot be guaranteed since no parser can handle all authentic sentences very well. Furthermore, the strategies which were usually used for structure alignment suffer from serious shortcomings. For instance, parse-to-parse matching which regards parsing and alignment as separate and successive procedures suffers from the inconsistency between grammars of different languages. Bilingual parsing which looks upon parsing and alignment as a simultaneous procedure needs an extra ‘bilingual grammar’. It is, however, difficult to write a complex ‘bilingual grammar’."," In this paper, a new statistical method called “bilingual chunking” for structure alignment is proposed.

However, the mismatching between complex structures across languages and the poor parsing accuracy of the parser will hinder structure alignment algorithms from working out high accuracy results.  A straightforward strategy for structure alignment is parse-to-parse matching, which regards the parsing and alignment as two separate and successive procedures. First, parsing is conducted on each language, respectively. Then the correspondent structures in different languages are aligned (e.g., Kaji, Kida & Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000). Unfortunately, automatic parse-to-parse matching has some weaknesses as described in Wu (2000). For example, grammar inconsistency exists across languages; and it is hard to handle multiple alignment choices."," To deal with the difficulties in parse-to-parse matching, Wu (1997) utilizes inversion transduction grammar (ITG) for bilingual parsing. Bilingual parsing approach looks upon the parsing and alignment as a single procedure which simultaneously encodes both the parsing and transferring information. It is, however, difficult to write a broad coverage ‘bilingual grammar’ for bilingual parsing."]},{"title":"2 Structure Alignment Using Bilingual Chunking 2.1 Principle","paragraphs":["The chunks, which we will use, are extracted from the Treebank. When converting a tree to the chunk sequence, the chunk types are based on the syntactic category part of the bracket label. Roughly, a chunk contains everything to the left of and including the syntactic head of the constituent of the same name. Besides the head, a chunk also contains pre-modifiers, but no post-modifiers or arguments (Erik. 2000).  Using chunk as the alignment structure, we can get around the problems such as PP attachment, structure mismatching across languages. Therefore, we can get high chunking accuracy.  Using bilingual chunking, we can get both high chunking accuracy and high chunk alignment accuracy by making the SL chunking process and the TL chunking process constrain and improve each other.  Our ‘bilingual chunking’ model for structure alignment comprises three integrated components: chunking models of both languages, and the crossing constraint; it uses chunk as the structure. (See Fig. 1)   The crossing constraint requests a chunk in one language only correspond to at most one chunk in the other language. For instance, in Fig. 2 (the dashed lines represent the word alignments; the brackets indicate the chunk boundaries), the phrase “the first man” is a monolingual chunk, it, however, should be divided into “the first” and “man” to satisfy the crossing constraint. By  Source Language Chunking Model (Integrated with POS tagging) Target Language Chunking Model (Integrated with POS tagging) Crossing Constraint"," Fig. 1 Three components of our model  [the first ][man ][who][would fly across][ the channel]  ","[","","] [","] [","","] [","] [","]  Fig. 2 the crossing constraint using crossing constraint, the illegal chunk candidates can be removed in the chunking process."," The chunking models for both languages work successively under the crossing constraint. Usually, chunking involves two steps: (1) POS tagging, and (2) chunking. To alleviate effectively the influence of POS tagging deficiency to the chunking result, we integrate the two steps with a unified model for optimal solution. This integration strategy has been proven to be effective for base NP identification (Xun, Huang & Zhou, 2001)."," Consequently, our model works in three successive steps: (1) word alignment between SL and TL sentences; (2) source language chunking; (3) target language chunking. Both (2) and (3) should work under the supervision of crossing constraints."]},{"title":"2.2 The Crossing Constraint","paragraphs":["According to (Wu, 1997), crossing constraint can be defined in the following."," For non-recursive phrases: Suppose two words w1 and w2 in language-1 correspond to two words v1 and v2 in language-2, respectively, and w1 and w2 belong to the same phrase of language-1. Then v1 and v2 must also belong to the same phrase of language-2."," We can benefit from applying crossing constraint in the following three aspects: • Consistent chunking in the view of alignment. For example, in Fig. 2, “the first man” should be divided into “the first” and “man” for the consistency with the Chinese chunks “","","” and “","”, respectively. • Searching space reduction. The chunking space is reduced by ruling out those illegal fragments like “the first man”; and the alignment space is reduced by confining those legal fragments like “the first” only to correspond to the Chinese fragments “","” or “","","” based on word alignment anchors. • Time synchronous algorithms for structure alignment. Time synchronous algorithms cannot be used due to word permutation problem before. While under the crossing constraint, these algorithms (for example, dynamic programming) can be used for both chunking and alignment."]},{"title":"2.3 Mathematical Formulation","paragraphs":["Given an English sentence l","eee wwwe ,...,21","= , its","POS tag sequence is denoted by l","eeee tttT ,...,21 = ,","where l is the sentence length.
