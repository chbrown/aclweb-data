All approaches have in common that they try to model a probability distribution over the readings of the UBG, which can be used to rank the competing analyses of a given sentence; see, e.g., Briscoe and Carroll (1993), Eisele (1994), Brew (1995), Abney (1997), Goodman (1997), Bod and Kaplan (1998), Johnson et al. (1999), Riezler et al. (2000), Osborne (2000), Bouma et al. (2001), or Schmid (2002).","Unfortunately, most of the proposed probability models are not mathematically clean in that the probabilities of all possible UBG readings do not sum to the value 1, a problem which is discussed intensively by Eisele (1994), Abney (1997), and Schmid (2002).","In addition, many of the newer approaches use log-linear (or exponential) models. Schmid (2002) outlines a serious problem for these models: log-linear models prevent the application of dynamic programming methods for the computation of the most probable parse, if complex features are incorporated. Therefore the run-time complexity of the disambiguation algorithm is linear in the number of parses of a sentence. If the number of parses grows exponentially with the length of the sentence, these approaches are simply impractical.","Our approach obviates the need for such models on the UBG side in that it shifts the responsibility to simpler CF models, indirectly obtained from the UBG. In more detail, the kernel of our novel disambiguation method for UBGs consists of the application of a context-free approximation for a given UBG (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and the exploita-tion of the standard probability model for CFGs.","In contrast to earlier approaches to disambiguation for UBGs, our approach has several advantages. Firstly, probabilistic modeling/training of context-free grammars is theoretically well-understood and can be effectively done in practice, using the inside-outside algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990). Secondly, the Viterbi algorithm enables CFG parsing and disambiguation in cubic time, exploiting dynamic programming techniques to specify the maximum-probability parse of a given sentence. Thirdly, probability distributions over the CFG trees are mathematically clean, if some weak conditions for this desired behaviour are fulfilled (Booth and Thompson, 1973).","In the rest of the paper, we present the context-free approximation, our novel disambiguation approach, and an experiment, showing that the approach is feasible."]},{"title":"2 Context-Free Approximation","paragraphs":["In this section, we briefly review a simple and intuitive approximation method for turning unification-based grammars, such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, UBG CFG approximation"," ","   ","","...

The picture illustrates that (i) each UBG reading of the sentence is associated with a non-empty set of syntax trees according to the CFG approximation, and (ii) that the sentence may have CFG trees, which can not be replayed by the UBG, since the CFG overgenerates (or at best is a correct approximation of the UBG). 1994) or PATR-II (Shieber, 1985) into context-free grammars (CFG). The method was introduced by Kiefer and Krieger (2000).","The approximation method can be seen as the construction of the least fixpointof a certain monotonic function and shares similarities with the instantiation of rules in a bottom-up passive chart parser or with partial evaluation in logic programming. The basic idea of the approach is as follows. In a firststep, one generalizes the set of all lexicon entries. The resulting structures form equivalence classes, since they abstract from word-specific information, such as FORM or STEM. The abstraction is specifiedby means of a restrictor (Shieber, 1985), the so-called lexicon restrictor. After that, the grammar rules are instantiated by unification, using the abstracted lexicon entries and resulting in derivation trees of depth 1. The rule restrictor is applied to each resulting feature structure (FS), removing all information contained only in the daughters of a rule. Additionally, the restriction gets rid of information that will either lead to infinitegrowth of the FSs or that does not constrain the search space. The restricted FSs (together with older ones) then serve as the basis for the next instantiation step. Again, this gives FSs encoding a derivation, and again the rule restrictor is applied. This process is iterated until a fixpoint is reached, meaning that further iteration steps will not add (or remove) new (or old) FSs to the set of computed FSs.","Given the FSs from the fixpoint, it is then easy to generate context-free productions, using the complete FSs as symbols of the CFG; see Kiefer and Krieger (2002). We note here that adding (and perhaps removing) FSs during the iteration can be achieved in different ways: either by employing feature structure equivalence","(structural equivalence) or by using FS subsumption",". It is clear that the resulting CFGs will behave differently (see figure 4). An in-depth description of the method, containing lots of details, plus a mathematical under-pinning is presented in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002). The application of the method to a mid-size UBG of English, and largesize HPSGs of English and Japanese is described in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002) and (Kiefer et al., 2000)."]},{"title":"3 A Novel Disambiguation for UBGs","paragraphs":["(Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) suggest that, given a UBG, the approximated CFG can be used as a cheap filterduring a two-stage parsing approach. The idea is to let the CFG explore the search space, whereas the UBG deterministically replays the derivations, proposed by the CFG. To be able to carry out the replay, during the creation of the CF grammar, each CF production is correlated with the UBG rules it was produced from.","The above mentioned two-stage parsing approach not only speeds up parsing (see figure 4), but can also be a starting point for an efficient stochastic parsing model, even though the UBG might encode an infinite number of categories. Given a training corpus, the idea is to move from the approximated CFG to a PCFG which predicts probabilities for the CFG trees. Clearly, the probabilities can be used for disambiguation, and more important, for ranking of CFG trees. The idea is, that the ranked parsing trees can be replayed one after another by the UBG (processing the most probable CFG trees first), establishing an order of best UBG parsing trees. Since the approximation always yields a CFG that is a super-set of the UBG, it might be possible that derivation trees proposed by the PCFG can not be replayed by the UBG. Nevertheless, this behavior does not alter the ranking of reconstructed UBG parsing trees.

Using this figure, it should be clear that a ranking of CFG trees induces a ranking of UBG readings, even if not all CFG trees have an associated UBG reading. We exemplify our idea in section 4, where we disambiguate a sentence with a PP-attachment ambiguity. As a nice side effect, our proposed stochastic parsing model should usually not explore the full search space, nor should it statically estimate the parsing results afterwards, assuming we are in-terested in the most probable parse (or say, the two most probable results)—the disambiguation of UBG results is simply established by the dynamic ordering of most probable CFG trees during the first parsing stage. measure 89 1058 temperature 72 1028 at 7 all 60 three 55 1018 decks 10 1033 951 929 960 873 687 304 1017 S measure 89 1058 temperature 72 1028 960 at 7 all 60 three 55 1018 decks 10 1033 951 183 873 687 304 1017 S Figure 3: Alternative readings licensed by the context-free approximation of the Gemini grammar."]},{"title":"4 Experiments Approximation.","paragraphs":["(Dowding et al., 2001) compared (Moore, 1999)’s approach to grammar approximation to (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000).

The given corpus of 500 sentences was divided into a training corpus (90%, i.e., 450 sentences) and a testing corpus (10%, i.e., 50 sentences). This standard procedure enables us (i) to apply the inside-outside algorithm to the training corpus, and (ii) to evaluate the resulting probabilistic context-free grammars on the testing corpus. We linguistically evaluated the maximum-probability parses of all sentences in the testing corpus (see section 5). For unsupervised training and parsing, we used the implementation of Schmid (1999).","Figure 5 shows a fragment of the probabilistic context-free approximation. The probabilities of the grammar rules are extracted after several training iterations with the inside-outside algorithm using the training corpus of 450 sentences. Disambiguation using maximum-probability parses. In contrast to most approaches to stochastic modeling of UBGs, PCFGs can be very easily used to assign probabilities to the readings of a given sentence: the probability of a syntax tree (the reading) is the product of the probabilities of all context-free rules occurring in the tree.","For example, the two readings of the sentence measure temperature at all three decks, as displayed in figure3, have the following probabilities: (first reading on the left-hand side) and ","(second reading on the right-hand side).
