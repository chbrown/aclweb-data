We present a formal architecture in the framework of a multi-dimensional, heavily lexicalized, efficientlyparsable dependency formalism (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), which uses lexical inheritance as a means to explicitly model syntactic variation. We concentrate on variation between prepositional phrases and nominal phrases which realize verbal arguments, and remedy problems that occur with this kind of variation in recent approaches like the HPSG linking architecture proposed by (Davis, 1998).","Section 2 presents and analyses some of the problematic data we can model, English dative shift, optional complements and thematic role alternations. Section 3 compares the HPSG account with less formal valency or dependency based approaches and comments on the shortcomings, focusing on the treatment of PP complements.

We then show how we use syntactic role hierarchies to account for the data in a linguistically concise way and defineadmissibility conditions for a TDG derivation. Section 5 contrasts our analysis of the dative shift construction with the analysis of thematic role alternations."]},{"title":"2 Linguistic Data","paragraphs":["Insights from corpus studies (e.g. the NEGRA treebank for German (Skut et al., 1998), or the material annotated in the Framenet (Baker et al., 1998) project on the basis of The Bank of English (Cobuild, 2001) show that the syntactic patterns specificverbs occur with vary stongly. Not only do we observe different patterns for different verbs, but also alternative patterns with the same verbs. (1) to (6) illustrate the well-known dative shift (Levin, 1993):45 phenomenon, which occurs with a restricted class of verbs only. While the distinction between (2) and (4) can be explained in terms of lexical semantics, even semantically closely related verbs as English give and deliver can differ in their syntactic behaviour, as the contrast between (1) and (5) shows. (1) [The postman] gave [him] [a package]. (2) [The postman] gave [a package] [to him]. (3) [The postman] charged [him] [5 Euros]. (4) *[The postman] charged [5 Euros] [to him].

(6) [The postman] delivered [a package] [to him].","In contrast to (Davis, 1998):3:562","for instance, we do not assume a difference in meaning between (1) and (2).3","Therefore, in order to compute a semantics from this data without spurious ambiguity, we must be able to express the semantic generalisation that to him and him realize the same semantic argument. It is useful to employ thematic roles in the lexicon and in grammatical descriptions for this purpose.4","See e.g. (Tarvainen, 1987), (Helbig, 1989), (Sgall et al., 1986) or the Framenet project (Baker et al., 1998) for different application-oriented sets of thematic roles (or “frame elements”). For discussion see e.g. (Helbig, 1995) or (Kruijff, 2001), for criticism see (Dowty, 1991). We can also use thematic roles to structure verbs into an ontology, as e.g. attempted by (Helbig, 1995), (Davis, 1998) or (Baker et al., 1998) in order to make semantic predictions for syntactic valency patterns. For instance, it is a regularity in English that verbs of charging do not show the dative shift (Levin, 1993), while verbs of change of possession sometimes do.","Now consider the set of German examples in (7) to (11), which all roughly express the proposition Peter robs her of her money. All of the patterns are attested in the NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998), but (10) cannot be found.","(7) [Peter] Peter beraubt robs [sie] her+ACC [ihres her+GEN Bargelds]. cash+GEN “Peter robs her of her cash.”","(8) [Peter] Peter beraubt robs [sie] her+ACC [um of ihr her Bargeld]. cash “Peter robs her of her cash.” (9) [Peter] beraubt [sie].

While the lexical entry for meaning (b) will exhibit the syntactic pattern illustrated by (1) only (*To give headache to someone), the entry for meaning (a) exhibits both the patterns in (1) and (2).","4","Note that we do not commit ourselves to a specificset of thematic roles in this paper. complements (Levin, 1993):33, (Helbig, 1995):99. Therefore, we will analyse syntactic arguments in terms of optionality and obligatoriness. Note that this distinction is not predictable from the thematic roles realized by the syntactic elements (e.g. by distinguishing inner and outer roles in (Sgall et al., 1986) and (Tarvainen, 1987)) nor by the syntactic form or even function of the syntactic elements. Neither is the distinction between obligatory and optional elements the same as the complement/adjunct distinction.","We analyse (1) to (6) as alternative realizations of a thematic role, because one semantic argument (the PATIENT) can either be realized as indirect object or PP, while the THEME is always realized as a direct object NP. Compare this data to alternations as in (12) and (13). Here, additionally, one syntactic function (direct object) is open for either of two thematic roles (Levin, 1993).

(Helbig, 1995):167 definesvalency frames on a formal syntactic and functional syntactic level, a thematic role level and a logical level in his 6-level-model, but only informally and for the purpose of learners’ dictionaries. There is a long tradition in German lexicography which has produced a number of valency dictionaries (e.g. (Helbig and Schenkel, 1975), (Fischer, 1997), (Engel and Schumacher, 1976)). The syntactic analyses in these dictionaries are compatible with our model, but they do not provide a thematic role level.","(Melcuk, 1988) characterizes valency frames in a similar fashion (94), but uses informal additions in natural language to constrain the possible patterns. Also (Melcuk, 1988) assumes different levels of representation. A shortcoming of the syntactic level in (Melcuk, 1988) is, though, that his syntactic classes are dependent on the specific lexical item, and therefore problematic to define. The approach we will take resembles LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) (Bresnan, 2001) in that it assumes syntactic relations.","(Davis, 1998) has recently proposed a linking the-ory in the formal framework of HPSG. He separates syntax and semantics by postulating thematic roles under the CONTENT feature of his HPSG architecture (Pollard and Sag, 1994), and syntactic characterizations of the arguments under CAT-EGORYjARG-ST and CATEGORYjSUBCAT. He has separate hierarchies of syntactic patterns (intrans, trans, ditrans, 5:32) and semantic classes (subtypes of RELATION, 5:72). These hierarchies interact by a set of linking constraints and yield a hierarchy of predicators (5:41), which specifiespossible link-ings of thematic roles to syntactic arguments. While (Helbig, 1995) obviously employs a large role set, (Davis, 1998) has only 6 roles, and moves thematic roles further down into semantics than we assume by postulating them on an event level, which “effectively amounts to a limited amount of semantic decomposition” (5:39). The shortcoming of the model is that the syntactic patterns assumed are very sparse indeed with only three transitivity classes. Due to this, semantic predictions can be made only for NP-complements, while PPs must be treated by a separate mechanism (“content sharing account”). Thus, there is no specificprediction for the prepositional complement in English dative shift constructions. The advantage of Davis’s model, in contrast, is the lexical inheritance architecture which is a formal means to capture generalizations."]},{"title":"4 Formalization","paragraphs":["We formalize our idea of linking and valency frames as an extension of the new lexicalized, dependency-based grammar formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), (Debusmann, 2001). So far, TDG is only concerned with syntax: every TDG analysis consists of an unordered dependency tree (ID tree) and an ordered and projective topology tree (LP tree). We only describe a subset of the full TDG grammar formalism (e.g. completely ignoring any issues concerning word order) and extend it with the notion of a thematic graph (TH graph). We call the version of TDG described in this paper TDGTH",". 4.1 Thematic graphs Peter will live in Taipei subj vbse ppin pcomp (14)","What is a “thematic graph”?

The value of valTH a set of pairs (q; p) of thematic roles and an optionality flag (thematic valency). For convenience, we write rp for (r; p), and qp for (q; p). The value of link is a set of pairs (q; r) of thematic and syntactic roles, expressing the mapping between them. We call a pair in this set a linking. 5 We write a(e) to denote the value of feature a at lexical","entry e. eat : 2 6 4 valID : fsubj!; objd?g valTH : fag!; th?g link : f(ag; subj);","(th; objd)g 3 7 5 (16)","As an example, (16) is a lexical entry for finite eat: eat has an obligatory subject (subj) and an optional direct object (objd) in its syntactic valency. Its thematic valency contains an obligatory AGENT and an optional THEME. The link-feature defines two linkings: one links the AGENT to the subject and the THEME to the direct object. 4.3 Lexical inheritance We introduce a mechanism of lexical inheritance. We write e = e1 u : : : u en for ‘lexical entry e inherits from lexical entries e1; : : : ; en’, and defineinheritance as the set union of the individual features’ values: e1 u : : : u en =2 4 valID : valID(e1) [ : : : [ valID(en) valTH : valTH(e1) [ : : : [ valTH(en) link : link(e1) [ : : : [ link(en) 3 5 We can now use lexical inheritance to model our notion of valency frames. We introduce the notion of a linking type as a lexical entry that does not specify any other lexical attributes besides valID, valTH and link. Such linking types specify a partial valency frame from which we can build complete valency frames by inheritance. For instance, consider the following two linking types: l ag subj : 2 4 valID : fsubj!g valTH : fag!g link : f(ag; subj)g 3 5 (17) l th objd : 2 4 valID : fobjd?g valTH : fth?g link : f(th; objd)g 3 5 (18) The linking type l ag subj maps the agent to the subject, and l th objd the theme to the direct object. Out of the two, we can construct our lexical entry for eat by lexical inheritance:","eat = l ag subj u l th objd (19) which amounts precisely to the lexical entry displayed in (16) above.

This linking type will be inherited by all English verbs that exhibit the dative-shift alternative realization. For instance, it is inherited by the lexical entry for the English verb give (cf. examples (1) and (2)). Additionally, give inherits from the linking type l ag subj definedin (17). l ag subj will be shared among a large set of other verbs which realize their agents as subjects, thus reducing redundancy in the lexicon.","gives = l ag subj u l pat dativeshift u l th objd (25)","The lexicon entry for deliver ((5) and (6)) will differ from the one for give by inheriting from l pat obji instead of l pat dativeshift and thus not allow for a dative shift.","For the German data in examples (7) to (11) we definea syntactic role hierarchy in the same fashion, where genitive and ppum are below a role ppumgen. Then, the lexical entry for berauben inherits from a linking type l theme ppumgen.","In contrast to alternative realizations, alternations as in examples (12) and (13) realize two different thematic roles (pat and th) as the same syntactic role (objd). By the lexical entry constraint in section 4.4, there cannot be a single lexical entry for both alternants of clear. We therefore model finite forms of clear by two separate valency frames (we skip the definitionsof some of the linking types).","clears = l ag subj u l pat objd u l th ppof (26)","clears = l ag subj u l th objd u l pat ppfrom (27)"]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed an architecture that abstractly captures reocurring patterns in the way in which different lexical items syntactically realize their semantic arguments. We focused on interchangeability between prepositional phrases and nominal phrases. We therefore defined a hierarchy of thematic roles, and a separate hierarchy of syntactic functions, clearly separating between syntax and semantics.","We enriched the framework of Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001) (TDG) with a third level of representation, thematic structure, and defined well formedness conditions on the thematic structure and on the relation between thematic structure (TH) and syntactic dominance (ID) structure. This enabled us to present a formal definitionof the concept of multi-level valency frames. We demonstrated how such valency frames can be assembled using the lexical inheritance model of TDG, in order to reduce lexical redundancy. We also proposed a treatment of auxiliary constructions using a notion of node collapsing.","We applied our formalism to English dative shift constructions, variation between NP and PP in German, optional complements, semantically empty elements, and thematic role alternations.","Our approach makes weaker theoretical predictions about “alternations” as opposed to “alternati ve realizations” than the approach in (Davis, 1998), but is more powerful in the treatment of PPs. This is partly due to the choice of an underlying dependency formalism, because dependency structures lead to concise and semantically flat parse trees. Our approach is data-driven in the sense that a wider range of syntactic patterns can be mapped to semantic arguments. Thus, it lends itself easy to techniques of automatically acquiring lexica from syntactically and semantically annotated corpora, which start developing at present ((Baker et al., 1998), (Skut et al., 1998)).","It is possible to include a mechanism that makes stronger predictions about alternations of the clear type, or about passivization. Another phenomenon we would like to tackle in this framework are raising and control constructions. We think we can use a concept similar to node collapsing for them."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Collin F. Baker, Charles J. Fillmore, and John B. Lowe. 1998. The Berkeley FrameNet project.
