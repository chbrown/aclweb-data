But like Chinese, there is no separator between Tibetan words. Tibetan word segmentation is essential for Tibetan information processing. In recent years, many experts did much work on Tibetan word segmentation. CHEN Yuzhong (2003) proposed a method based on case auxiliary words and continuous features to segment Tibetan text. Based on this method, using reinstallation rules to identify Abbreviated Words, CAI Zhijie (2009) designed and implemented the Banzhida Tibetan word segmentation system. QI (2006) proposed a three level method to segment Tibetan text. Dolha (2007), Zhaxijia (2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) and TASHI (2009) researched the word categories and annotation scheme for Tibetan corpus and the parts-of-speech and tagging set standards. At present, there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmentation. However, models which are used in Chinese word segmentation, such as HMM, ME, CRF, have to be trained with segmented corpus. As a result, we can’t use them in Tibetan word segmentation. So people mainly use machine matching method based on dictionary in Tibetan word segmentation. But machine matching can not be used to identify Tibetan numbers because we can not include all numbers in the dictionary.","In Tibetan text, numbers have 3 different representations. The first is Arabic numbers, such as “2010”. The second is Tibetan alphabet numbers composed with Tibetan digital characters: ༠(0),༡(1),༢(2),༣(3),༤(4),༥(5), ༦(6), ༧(7), 719 ༨(8),༩(9), such as “༢༠༡༠”(2010). The third is Tibetan syllable numbers(“Tibetan numbers” in short) which are composed with Tibetan syllables, such as བཅོ་ལྔ།(fifteen).The former two classes of numbers can be identified by combin-ing adjacent number characters. However, this method is not fit to the third class, because some Tibetan syllables are used not only in numbers but also in other common words.","According to papers written by Dolha (2007), Zhaxijia (2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) and TASHI (2009), Tibetan numbers should be taken as single words in Tibetan word segmentation, however, we haven’t found any paper on the issue of the identification of Tibetan numbers in Tibetan word segmentation.","In this paper, we propose a method which is based on classification of number components to identify the third class of numbers."]},{"title":"2 Composition of Tibetan numbers","paragraphs":["In Tibetan, we use the following syllables (words) to express the meanings of number one to nine: གཅིག གཉིས། གསུམ། བཞི། ལྔ། དྲུག བདུན། བརྒྱད། དགུ།, and the following different syllables for ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, ten million and so on: བཅུ། བརྒྱ། སྟོང་། ཁྲི། འབུམ། ས་ཡ། བྱེ་བ།","དུང་ཕྱུར།.....Generally, Tibetan syllable numbers","are composed by these syllables, but some","syllables have variants, and sometimes we have","to use different conjunctions according to the","context. The composition of Tibetan syllable","numbers has the following rules. 1. Number 1-10 are expressed with the syl-","lables mentioned above, but sometimes","variants are used: ཆིག(1),ཉིས།(2),སུམ།(3). 2. Number “tens” (20, 30, 40 ...) have the","form of “(2-9)+བཅུ”. but in “20”, “30”,","variants of “2” and “3” are used, while in","“60”, “70”, “80”, variant of “ten”(ཅུ།) is","used. 3. Number 11-19 have the form of","“བཅུ(10)+(1-9)”, but in “13” and “15” variant of “10”(བཅོ།) is used.","4. Number 21-99, except “tens”, have the form of “(tens)+conjunction+(1-9)”. Different conjunctions are used according to different “tens”: རྩ། སོ། ཞེ། ང་། རེ། དོན། གྱ། གོ. Sometimes, this form is abbreviated to “conjunction+(1-9)”.","5. In number which is larger then 100, conjunction (དང) may be used, just like “and” in the reading of English number “115”. Sometimes, (མེད) is used to express the meaning of vacancy. For example, number “507” is “ལྔ་བརྒྱ་བཅུ་མེད་བདུན”: ལྔ་(five) བརྒྱ་(hundred)བཅུ་ (ten)མེད་(has no)བདུན (seven).","6. Composition of numbers larger than 1000 can be deduced.","7. Ordinal numeral has the form of “(cardinal numeral)+(པorཔོ)”. 8. Multiples have the form of “ལྡབ+ (cardi-","nal numeral)”. 9. Fractions have the form of “(cardinal numeral) +ཆ+ (cardinal numeral)”. 10. Decimals have the form of “(cardinal numeral) +དང+(གྲངས་ཆུངorཚེག)+ (cardinal numeral)”. “གྲངས་ཆུང” or “ཚེག” means the decimal point.","11. Approximate numbers have the form of “(cardinal numeral)+(suffix)”. Suffix can be one of (ཚོ། ཙམ། ཡས་མས། ལྷག་ཙམ། གྲངས་ཁ་ཤས། ཕྲག་ཁ་ཤས།...) according to the meaning to be expressed.","12. Some Tibetan numbers don’t obey the above rules. They have no form of number, but have meanings of number, such as “དང་པོ” (first)."]},{"title":"3 Tibetan number identification","paragraphs":["In this paper, we call all syllables mentioned in the previous section “number components” in general. For some of these number components, we can take it as a part of number when we meet one of them. For others, we can’t, because they can be used to express non-number meanings. So we have to check whether it is a part of a number according to the context when we meet a number component.","Tibetan number identification is a part of Tibetan word segmentation. In Tibetan word seg-720 mentation system, Tibetan text is segmented into words by maximum matching method. In this procedure, every Tibetan number is segmented into number components. Then, identification module combines adjacent number components when they meet a certain predefined rules.","In this section, we first briefly introduce the whole procedure of Tibetan word segmentation, then the classification of number components and the tagging method to identify Tibetan number. 3.1 Flow of Tibetan word segmentation Critical dictionary Sentence breaking","Parts segmentation Maximum matching word segmentation & abbreviated word identification Common dictionary Tibetan number identification Number component dictionary","Input Tibetan Text Output","Segmentation result"," Figure 1. The flow chart of Tibetan word seg-","mentation"," As shown in Figure 1, for the input Tibetan text, we first segment it into sentences. Then we segment each sentence into parts with case-auxiliary words. In this procedure, a critical dictionary is used because case-auxiliary words can be a part of some Tibetan words (critical words). When we meet a critical word in Tibetan text, we should not segment it into shorter words. Next, we segment each part into words and identify the abbreviated word (CAI Zhijie, 2009) by maximum matching method with a common dictionary and the number components dictionary. At last, we identify Tibetan numbers and output word segmentation result.","In the procedure of segmenting a part into words, a Tibetan number is segmented into words; we must ensure every one of them is a number component. To do this, both common dictionary and number components dictionary are used. As we use maximum matching method, all Tibetan number words in the common dictionary should be obsolete.","Identification module tags each number component with a tag according to the class which it belongs to, then updates the tags and combines adjacent number components when they meet a certain predefined rules. 3.2 Classification of number components We classify number components into the following five classes according to their functions and ambiguity.","Basic number: these number components are the basis of Tibetan numbers. Every one of them can be an independent number. If we meet it in context, we should take it as a part of a Tibetan number. Including: Tibetan number 1-9(གཅིག གཉིས། གསུམ། བཞི། ལྔ། དྲུག བདུན། བརྒྱད། དགུ།); ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, ten million and so on(བཅུ། བརྒྱ། སྟོང་། ཁྲི། འབུམ། ས་ཡ། བྱེ་བ། དུང་ཕྱུར།...); and their variants.","Number prefix: when it is used as a part of Tibetan number, the next word must be a basic number, while the previous word may be or may not be a number component. Including: abbreviations of “(tens)+conjunction” (སོ། ཞེ། ང་། རེ། དོན། གྱ། གོ); variants of 1, 2, 3(ཆིག ཉིས། སུམ); decimal point(གྲངས་ཆུང་andཚེག).","Number linker: when it is used as a part of Tibetan number, both the previous word and the next word must be number components. These include (དང་། ཆ མེད་). Conjunctions (སོ། ཞེ། ང་། རེ། དོན། གྱ། གོ) belong to number prefix class, so we don’t include them in this class. But Conjunction (རྩ) doesn’t belong to number prefix class, we include it in this class. 721","Number suffix: these number components are used to express the meaning of “total number”, “approximate number”, and “ordinal number” and so on. They follow basic number and should be taken as a part of Tibetan number word. Including: ཚོ། ཙམ། ཡས་མས། ལྷག་ཙམ། གྲངས་ཁ་ཤས། ཕྲག་ཁ་ཤས།...","Independent number: these number components have no form of number, but have meanings of number, such as “དང་པོ” (first).","The difference between “basic number” and “Independent number” is: a basic number can be a Tibetan number itself or a part of a Tibetan number, while an independent number is a Tibetan number itself, but it can’t be a part of a Tibetan number. 3.3 Number identification As shown in Figure 2, identification module tags each number component with a tag according to the class which it belongs to, then updates the tags and combines adjacent number components when they meet a certain predefined rules. "," Figure 2. The flow of number identification  Class Tag Basic number N (Number) Number prefix P (Prefix) Number linker L (Linker) Number suffix S(Suffix) Independent number I(Independent) Other(non-number) O (Other) Table 1. Classes and their tags ","We assign every class with a tag, as shown in Table 1. The tagging procedure screens every segmented part of Tibetan sentences, and tags every word with a tag according to the class which the word belongs to. If the word is not a number component, we tag it with “O” (Other).","As some number components can be used to express non-number meanings, (the cases exist in both number prefix class and number linker class), we have to check whether it is a part of a number according to the context. For number prefix, we take it as a part of number only if it is followed by a basic number, while for number linker, only if it follows a basic number and it is followed by another basic number. We define two rules to do this work.","","Rule 1: update tag series “PN” to “NN”.","Rule 2: update tag series “NLN” to “NNN”.","","The tags updating algorithm applies the rules to the current word series until no tag is updated. After tags updating, the tag of a number prefix (“P”) is updated to “N” when it is a part of Tibetan number in the context, but the tag will still be “P” when it is not a part of Tibetan number. It is the same for number linkers.","Combination algorithm combines adjacent number components to form a Tibetan number word. It mainly combines continuous number components with tags “NN...N”, and the following word is combined too if it has a tag “S”. The tag of the number is updated to “N”. All words with tag “N” or “I” are taken as Tibetan numbers after combination.","Then the segmentation result is output.","For example, for the following Tibetan sentence:","ལས་འཛོལ་མང་པོ་ཞིག་ནི་བརྒྱ་ཆ་གཅིག་གམ་ཐ་ན་བརྒྱ་ཆ་གྲངས་ཆུང་ལྔའི་ ནང་ཁོངས་ཀྱི་ལྷུ་ལག་གཅིག་ལ་སྐྱོན་ཤོར་ནས་བྱུང་འདུག (A considerable parts of accidents were due to the faults of 1% or even 0.5% of components.)","After parts segmentation and maximum matching word segmentation, it is segmented to:","ལས་འཛོལ་/ མང་པོ་/ ཞིག་/ ནི་/ བརྒྱ་/ ཆ་ / གཅིག་/ གམ་/ ཐ་ན་/ བརྒྱ་/ ཆ་ / གྲངས་ཆུང་/ ལྔ/ འི་/ ནང་ཁོངས་/ ཀྱི་/ ལྷུ་ལག་གཅིག་/ ལ་/","སྐྱོན་ཤོར་/ ནས་/ བྱུང་/ འདུག/ After tagging: ལས་འཛོལ་/(O) མང་པོ་/(O) ཞིག་/(O) ནི་/(O) བརྒྱ་/(N) ཆ་ /(L) གཅིག་/(N) གམ་/(O) ཐ་ན་/(O) བརྒྱ་/(N) ཆ་ /(L) གྲངས་ཆུང་/(P) ལྔ/(N) འི་/(O) ནང་ཁོངས་/(O) ཀྱི་/(O) ལྷུ་ལག་གཅིག་/(O) ལ་/(O) སྐྱོན་ཤོར་/(O) ནས་/(O) བྱུང་/(O)","འདུག/(O) The corresponding tag series is: OOOONLNOONLPNOOOOOOOOO After the first run of tags updating, the tag se-","ries is changed to: OOOONNNOONLNNOOOOOOOOO 722 After the second run of tags updating, the tag series is changed to: OOOONNNOONNNNOOOOOOOOO In the third run of tags updating, no tag is updated. Then, combination algorithm combines adjacent number components corresponding to the continuous “N” tags.

Accuracy of Tibetan number identification on 6 corpuses  As there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmentation, we have to make experiment on original Tibetan texts. We make use of several books which are written in Tibetan, and collect many web pages from several Tibetan web sites. After preprocessing, we get six corpuses. The basic information about the corpuses is shown in Table 2. Note that, in Table 2, the column “BNS” includes all sentences which have in it at least one number component belonging to basic number class, while the column “TNS” includes all sentences which have at least one Tibetan number in it. The count of the former is significantly larger than the count of the later because some basic numbers are used in idioms and proverbs which should be segmented as single words, thus we don’t take them as number components under this circumstance. Figure 3 shows the results of our experiment. As we can see, the total identification accuracy is 99.21%. As we have included all basic numbers in our method, theoretically the recall is 100%.","After analyzing the results, we find that wrongly identified words can be divided into two classes. One is that there is a conjunction (དང) between two Tibetan numbers, but is taken as one Tibetan number, such as “བཅུ་དང་ཉི་ཤུ།” (ten and twenty), “ཁྲི་གཅིག་དང་ཁྲི་གཉིས” (ten thousand and twenty thousand). The other is that some Tibetan numbers has other non-number meanings in the context, but our algorithm takes them as numbers. For instance, “ཞེ་གཅིག” means 41 when it is used as a number, but it has another meaning of “similarly”; “དོན་ལྔ” means 75 when it is used as a number, but it has the meaning of “the five internal organs”."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Tibetan syllables are separated with syllable dots.
