Such a separation enables the system to have syntactic grammars, language specific but domain general, and semantic knowledge bases, domain specific but language general.

Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper introduces a new approach to knowledge-based machine translation for well-defined domains, integrating two recent advances in computational linguistics: entity-oriented parsing [16] and functional grammars [4, 19]. The entity-oriented formalism has several strengths in representing semantic knowledge for circumscribed domains, but has limitations in representing general syntactic knowledge. Functional grammar formalisms, such as lexical functional grammar (LFG) and functional unification grammar (UG), on the other hand, can represent general syntactic knowledge, but are severely limited in their ability to represent general semantic information. In our approach, the semantic and syntactic knowledge bases are developed separately in the entity-oriented and functional grammar formalisms, and a multi-stage grammar preoompfler compiles tfiem into a single knowledge base which contains both syntactic and semantic information in a form suitable for efficient real-time parsing. Our integrated approach copes with limitations of both entity-oriented and functional grammar formalisms, retaining the advantages of each. The approach is particularly well suited for machine translation, where knowledge of multiple languages must be represented in a uniform manner. Knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) [8] is the process of applying syntactic knowledge of the source language and semantic knowledge pertinent to the source text in order to produce a canonical language-free meaning representation, which may then be rendered in many different languages. The analysis process of producing a meaning representation is far more complex than that of using target-language knowledge to express the meaning, representation in the target language, because the former is a many-to-one mapping, whereas the latter may be coerced into a one-to-one mapping. 2 Whereas KBMT is in principle far superior to conventional transfer grammar techniques requiring a human translator (the \"posteditor\") to clean Lip syntactic and semantic errors [5, 8], in practice semantic analysis requires fairly thorough coverage of the domain. This ravenous hunger for domain knowledge makes KBMT more' practical for domains in which the development of the knowledge base can be amortizecl over very large numbers of texts to translate .. domains such as stocks and other security negoti~:Ltions, doctor-patient communication, weather forecasts, banking transactions, financial reports, economic analyses, invoices and purchase orders, etc. Thus, KBM] is particularly well-suited for multi-lingual Iranslation in high.volume well-defined semantic domains. Whereas the technical feasibility of KBMT was proposed and demonstrated for limited domains by Carbonell, Cullingford and Gershman [5], its practical utility remained eh.lsive. The entity-oriented approach factors linguistic and domain knowledge into separate data structures, thus making KBMT systems far more extensible and economically attractive than the earlier approaches. Moreover, recognizing that on occasion some esoteric domain knowledge necessary for semantic analysis will be lacking, we retain the possibility of interacting with a human user knowledgeable of the domain (but not of different target languages) to clarify any difficulties too complex for the domain semantics to handle, as illustrated in figure 1-1."]},{"title":"2. Background","paragraphs":["Automating various forms of syntactic analysis has been a central concern of Computational Linguistics, producing methods ranginq from context-free grarnmar interpreters [11,25, 13], to ATNs[28], to unification grammars [18], and lexical-functional grammars [4]. The problem is that the production of accurate, uoarnbigaous parses of [he source text, tolerant of minor grammatical deviations; requires a fairly complete semantic model of the domain, and a method for bringing the semantic knowledge to bear in the parsing process. Semantically-oriented parsers have succeeded at integrating semantics with syntax, but only at the cost of intertwining both knowledge suurces into ttlo program 1The riathors would like to acknowledge the other members of the the machine tlanslation laboratory at CMU who contributed in various ways to the research described in this paper: Peggy Anderson, Philip Franklin, Alex Ilcuphuaml, Marion Kee, I liroaki Sails, Yuko Tomita and Teruka Watanabe. 2The analyzer needs to comprehend all possible syntactic variants of any semantic messafjo in the analysis phase because it cannot contrel the form of its input, but to produce acceptable output, the generator need only render the the meaning in a well-d~.~fined staridald surface form.

Static separation has the advantage that as linguistic coverage increases, or new languages are added to the system, parsing (and translation) still function for all previous semantic domains. Conversely, if the semantic domains are extended, or new ones added, parsing and translation of texts in these domains will function for all previously entered languages. In contrast, earlier methods that mixed semantic and syntactic information required hand-crafted updates to all previous structures in order to integrate new grammatical extensions or new languages. With the possible exception of Lytinen [21J, who attempted a rudimentary form of static separation and dynamic integration, this rather appealing principle has not heretofore been a primary design criterion of natural language parsers in general, much less full machine-translation systems. Many of the syntactic analysis methods do not integrate well with semantic knowledge, especially knowledge that must be kept in separate data structures and integrated only by the preeompiler at the run:time language intepretation process. Similarly, many of the semantic representation formalisms do not lend themselves well to dynamic integration with syntactic constraints at parse time. The best fit we have been able to achieve comes from precompiling syntactic and semantic knowledge into a single knowledge base which is used only at run.time, as described in the subsequent sections. 3."]},{"title":"System Overview","paragraphs":["Figure 3-1 shows the architecture of our current system. As mentioned in the previous section, we modularize domain-specific semantic knowledge and domain-independent (but language-specific) syntactic knowledge. We precompile semantic entities and LFG-style grammars into a single large grammar which is less perspicuous but more efficient. This merged grammar is further precompiled into a yet larger parsing table for added efficiency, enabling the run-time system to parse input text in a very efficient manner using the parsing algorithm recently introduced by Tomita [26, 25].

An entity definition contains information about tile internal structure of the entities, about relations to other entities, about the way tile entities will be manifested ia tile natural language input, and about the correspondence between the internal structure and multiple surface forms for each entity. Let us consider the domain of elector-patient conversations; in particular, the patient's initial complaint aboul some ailment. Entities in this domain include an event entity PA/IENI-COMPLAINT-ACT and object entities PAIN, HUMAN and so on. A fragment of an entity.oriented grammar is shown in figure 4.1. The notation here is slightly simplified from that of Hayes, Sentences of different surface form that should be recognized as instantiations of this entity include:","I have a head ache","I have a burning pain in the chest.","I don't feel any pain.","Did you have a dull ache in your head?

A', [he result ol parsing a sentence (see figure 4-2), a composiiion uf the semantic porlion e[ the instantiated orltities is produced. This knowledge structure may be given to any backend process, whether it be a language generator (for the target language), a paraphraser, a data.base query system, or an expert system. The primary advantage of the entity-oriented grammar fortnalism hinges on its clarity of the sub-language definition (see Kittredge[20] for a discussion of sub-languages). Since all information relating to an entity is grouped in one place, a language definer will be able to see more clearly whether a definition is complete and what would be the consequences of any addition or change to the definition. Similarly, since syntactic and semantic information about an entity are grouped together, the former can refer to the latter in a clear and coherent way, beth in the grarnmar production and in the run time system. This advantage is even more valuable in the application to multi-lingual machine translation. Because the semantic portions of the entities are totally language independent, we can use one set of entity definitions for all languages .- merely requiring that each entity have a multiple number of surface forms; one or more for each language. In this way, on can ensure that semantic coverage is consistent across all languages. In addition to clarity and its multi.lingual extensibility, another advantage of the entity-oriented approach isrobustness in dealing with extragrammatical input. Robust recovery from ill-formed input is a crucial feature for practical interactive language systems, but is beyond the immediate scope of this paper. See Carbonell and Hayes [7J for a full discussion on entity.based robust parsing. The major limitation of entity-oriented grammars arises from the very same close coupling of syntax and semantics: all syntactic knowledge common across domains (or across entities within one domain) must be replicated by hand for each and every entity definition. Syntactic generalities are not captured. This problem is not merely an aesthetic one; it takes prodigious efforts for grammar developers to build and perfect each domain grammar, with little cross-domain transfer. 14ow then, can one overcome this central limitation and yet retain all the advantages of semantic analysis in general and the entity-oriented approach in particular? The answer lies in decoupfing the syntactic information at grammar dew)lopment time -- thus having a general grammar for each language and integrating it via an automated precompilation process to produce highly coupled structures for the run-time system. Such an approach has been made possible through the advent of unification and flmctional gramrnars."]},{"title":"5. The Functional Grammar Formalism","paragraphs":["Functional grammars, as presented by Kay [18], provide the key to automated compilation of syntactic and semantic knowledge. In essence, they define syntax in a functional manner based or] syntactic rolus, ralher than by positions of constituents in the surface string. The functional framework has clear advantages for languages such as Japanese, wh~,re word order is of milch less significance than in t£nglish, but case markings tape up the role of providin.~l Ihe surface cues for assigning syntactic and semantic roles to each constituent. Moreover, functional structures integrate far more coherently into case-frame based semantic structures such as entity definitions. Two well-known functional grammar formalisms are Functional Unification Grammar rUG)[19] and Lexical Function Grammar (LFG] [4]. In this paper, however, we do not distinguish between them and refer to both by the term \"functional grammar\". Application of the functional grammar formalism to machine translation is discussed in [tg]. Attempts have being made to implement parsers using these grammars, most notably in the PATR-II project at Stanford [22, 24]. However, these efforts have not been integrated with external semantic knowledge bases, and have not been applied in the context of KBMT systems. There are two main advantages of using the functional grammar formalism in practical machine translation systems: • A system implemented strictly within the functional grammar formalism will be reversible, in the sense that if the system maps from A to B then, to the same extent, it maps from Eli to A. lhus, we do not need to write separate grammars for parsing and generation. We merely compile the same grammar into an efficient uni.directional structure for parsing, and a different uni-directional structure for generation into that language. • Functional grammar formalisms such as UG and LFG are well-known among computational linguists, and therefore need not be trained (with some justifiable resistance) to write grammars in arcane system-specific formalisms. The general problem in parsing with functional gramrnars is implementation inefficiency for any practical application. Although much work has been done to enhance efficiency [24, 22], the functional grammar formalisms are considered far less efficient than formalisrns like ATNs[28] or (especially) context-free phrase structure grammars. We resolve this efficiency problem by precompiling a grammars written in a the functional grammar (together with a separate domain semantics specification) into an augmented context-free grammars, .as described in the following section."]},{"title":"6. Grammar Precompilation and Efficient On-Line Parsing","paragraphs":["The previous two sections have described two kinds of knowledge representation methods: the entity.oriented grammar formalism for domain specific but language general semantic knowledge ,and the functional grammar formalism for domain-independent but language specific syntactic knowledge In order 635 to parse a sentence in real time using these knowledge bases, we precompile the semantic and syntactic knowledge, as well as morphological rules and 'dictionary, into a single large morph/syn/sem grammar. This morph/syn/sem grammar is represented by a (potentially very large) set of context-free phrase structure rules, each of which is augmented with a Lisp program for test and action as in ATNs 3 A simplified fragment of a morph/syn/sem grammar is shown in figure 6-1. patient-complalot-act-1-S --> patient-NP complaint-act-1-VP ((cond ((equal (not (getvalue '(x1: agr:)))","(oetvalue '(x2: agr:)))","(return nil))) (setvalue '(xO: semcase:) (getvalue '(x2: semcase:))) (setvalue '(xO: semcase: agent:) (getvalue '(x1: semcase:))) (setvalue '(xO: syncase:) (getvalue '(x2: syncase:))) (setvalue '(xO: syncase: subj:) (getvalue '{xt:))) (return (getvalue '(xO:)))) complaint-act-l-VP --> complaint-act-l-V ((setvalue\"(xO: semcase:) (getvalue '(x1: semcase:))) (setvalue '(xO: syncase: prod:) (getvalue '(x1:))) (setvalue '(xO: agr:) (getvalue '(x1: agr:))) (setvalue '(xO: form:) (getvalue '(x1: form:))) (return (getvalue '(xO:)))) complaint-act-1-V --> ACHE-V ((setvalue '(xO: semcase: cfname:) 'PATIENT-COMPLAINT-ACT) (setvalue '(xO: agr:) (getvalue '{x1: agr:))) (setvalue '(xO: form:) (getvalue '(xl: form:))) (return (getvalue '(xO)))) Figure 6-1 : A Compiled Grammar Fragment Once we have a grammar in this form, we can apply efficient context-free parsing algorithms, and whenever the parser reduces constituents into a higher-level nonterminal using a phrase structure rule, the Lisp program associated with the rule is evaluated. The Lisp program handles such aspects as construction of a semantic representation of the input sentence, passing attribute values among constituents at different levels and checking semantic and syntactic constraints such as subject-verb agreement. Recall that those Lisp programs are generated automatically by the grammar precompiler from LFG f-structures and semantic entities. Note also that the Lisp programs can be further compiled into machine code by the Lisp compiler, We adopt the algorithm introduced by Tomita [25, 26] as our context-free parsing algorithm to parse a sentence with the nlorph/syn/sem grammar. The Tomita algorithm can be viewed as an extended LR parsing algorithm [t]. We compile further the morph/syn/sem grammar further into a table called the augmented LR parsing table, with which the algorithm works very efficiently. The Temita algorithm has three major advantages in the application of real-time machine translation systems; raThe algorithm is fast, due to the LR table precompilation; in several tests it has proven faster than any ether general context-free parsing algorithm presently in practice. For instance, timings indicate a 5 to t0 fold speed advantage over Earley's algorithm in several experiments with English grammars and sarnple sets of sentences. • The efficiency of the algorithm is not affected by the size of its grammar, once the LR parsing table is obtained. This characteristic is especially important for our system, because the size of the morph/syn/sem grammar will be very large In practical applications. ,, The algorithm parses a sentence strictly from left to right, proving all the on-line parsing advantages describe below. The on-line parser starts parsing as soon as the user types in the first word of a sentence, without waiting for the end of a line or a sentence boundary. There are two main benefits from on.line parsing: raThe parser's response time can be reduced significantly. When the user finishes.typing a whole sentence, most of the input sentence has been already processed by the parser, • Any errors, such as mis-typing and ungrammatical usages, can be detected almost as soon as they occur, and the parser can warn the user immediately without waiting for the end of the line. Thus, on-line parsing provides major advantage for interactive applications (sucb as real-time parsing, immediate translation of telex messages, and eventual integration sith speech recognition and syntesis systems), but is transparent when operating in batch. processing mode for long texts. More discussion of on-line parsing can be found in Chapter 7 of Tomita [25]."]},{"title":"7. Future Directions","paragraphs":["The twin advantages of the KBMT approach and the reversible functional grammars, applied to f-structures and semantic entity definitions, are 1) to provide a measure of extensibility that cannot be achieved via the conventional transfer grammar approach, and 2) to enable efficient real-time parsing via multi-stage precompilation. A further advantage over traditional transfer grammars becomes evident when one considers the translation problem from a more global perspective. In order to translate between any pair of N languages, our approach requires .the development of only N bi-directienal grammars (one per language). On the other hand, the conventional transfer approach requires that a new grammar be developed for each pair of languages and for each direction of the translation, Thus, to achieve the same number of bi-directional translations, requires on the order of N 2 transfer grammars. This calculation yields over 5,000 transfer grammars vs 72 functional/entity grammars to translate among the 72 most commonly spoken languages today. Recall that in addition to the economy of developrnent argument, the KBMT paradigm produces meaning.invariant translations for those domains whose semantics have been successfully codified. Although we have made significant inroads in the establishment of knowledge-based machine translation as a viable and superior alternative to the transfer grammar methodology, much of the difficult work remains before us. The integration of entity-oriented semantic representations and a generalized functional grammar, coupled with grammar precompilers, on-line parsers and generator provide a significant improvement over the first successful attempts to perform knowledge.based machine translation [10, 5]. The improvements are based on extensibility and uniformity of the semantic and syntactic knowledge sources, providing static separation and dynamic \"run-time\" integration, Our initial implementations convince us that this approach may hold the key to practical KBMT. Our pilot system operates in a subdomain ()f doctor.patient communications, selected for its relative syntactic richness, but fairly self-contained semantics. We have selected English and Japanese as our initial source and target languages, although we are also starting to investigate Spanish, French, German and Italian.

We intend to grow this pilot system in several dimensions, including achieving a measure of completeness in subdomain coverage, adding one or two more languages, moving to a second and perhaps a third domain, and tailoring our implementation for relative efficiency of operation by completing the development of our multi-phase precompilers. In additio!] to continued construction and extension of the pilot system -- the vehicle through which we are testing our theoretical tenets -- we are pursing the following objectives: • Bi-directionality -- As discussed above, functional grammars are theoretically bi-directional, but such a property has not yet been proven in practice for large scale systems. Our approach is not to interpret the bi-directienal grammars directly, but rather to compile them into much more efficient (and different) parsing and generation grarnmars, The latter endeavor still requires empirical wtlidation. o hlcrenlerltal Compilation .. In order to expedite the grammar development and testing cycle, we are contemplating incremental compilation for new additions or recent changes into large existing gn~mmars rapidly.

All such extensions would work in concert with existing domain knowledge, lexicon, and grammar. e Robustness -- The recognition of ill-structured language is very important, especially for the short-text domains we envision for our system (telex messages, banking transactions, doctor.patient dialogs, etc.). We have built selective-relaxation methods that integrate semantic and syntactic constrains before in the MULTIPAR system [7, 12], but have not yet investigated their application or extension into the functional/entity paradigm selected here. • Speech Compatibility -- A long-term objective is to integrate speech recognition and generation with on-line real-time machine translation. A parallel project at CMU is integrating speaker-independent continuousospeech recognition with a case.frame semantic parser of English [15]. We expect results of that investigation, which is already moving towards the precornpilation parsers discussed here, to pave the way towards eventual translation of spoken language. We expect that these and other developments will require a continued focused research effort over the coming years. 4 We claim only to have taken one more stride in the long march towards the theoretical and practical development of fully-automated knowledge-based machine translation."]},{"title":"8.
