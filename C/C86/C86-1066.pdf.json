Introduction and Overview This paper describes the current state of a three-year project aimed at the development of software for use in handling large quantities of dictionary information within natural language processing systems. 1 The project was accepted for funding by SERC/Alvey commencing ill June 1984, and is being carried out by Graeme Ritchie and Alan Black at the University of Edinburgh and Steve Puhnan and Graham Russell at the University of Cambridge. It is one of three closely related projects funded under the Alvey IKBS Programme (Natural Language Tlleme); a parser is under development at Edinburgh by Henry Thompson and John Phillips, and a sentence grammar is being devised by Ted Briscoe and Clare Grover at Lancaster and Bran Boguraev and John Carroll at Cambridge. It is intended that the software and rules produced by all three projects will be directly compatible and capable of functioning in an integrated system.","Realistic and useful natural language processing systems such as database front-ends require large numbers of words, together with associated syntactic and semantic Information, to be efficiently stored in machine-readable form. Our system is Intended to provide the necessary facilities, being designed to store a large number (at least 10,000) of words and to perform morphological analysis on them, covering both Inflectional and derlvatlonal morphology. In pursuit of these objectives, the dictionary associates with each word information concerning its morphosyntactlc properties. Users are free to modify the system In a number of ways; they may add to the lexical entries Lisp functions that perform semantic manipulatlons, and tailor the dictionary to the particular subject matter they are interested in (different databases, for example). It Is also hoped that the system is general enough to be of use to linguists wishing to Investigate the morphology of English and other languages. Contents of the basle data files may be altered or replaced: 1. A 'Word Grammar' file contains rules assigning inter-","nal structure to complex words, 2. A 'Lexicon' file holds the morpheme entries which","include syntactic and other Information associated","with stems and affixes. 3. A 'Spelling Rules' file contains rules governing permis-","sible correspondences between the form of morphemes","listed in the lextcon and complex words consisting of","sequences of these morphemes. Once these data flies have been prepared, they are compiled using a number of pre-processtng functions that operate to produce a set of output files. These constitute a fully expanded and cross-Indexed dictionary which can then be accessed from within LISP.","The process of morphological analysis consists of parslng a sequence of Input morphemes with respect to the word grammar, It Is Implemented as an active chart parser (Thompson & Rltchle (1984)), and builds a structure in the form of a tree in which each node has two 1 This work is supported by SERC/AIvey grant number GR/C/79114. G.D. Rttchle A.W. Black","Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh associated values, a morphosyntactlc category, and a rule Identifier.","The system is written in FRANZ LISP (opus 42.15) running under Berkeley 4.2 Unix. Future developments will concentrate on improving its efficiency, in particular by restructuring the code. We also hope to produce an implementation in C, which should offer a faster response time. 2. Linguistic Assumptions The grammatical framework underlying the linguistic aspects of the system is that of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, as set out in Gazdar et al. (1985). Morphological categories employed here correspond to the syntactic categories in that work, and the type of syntactic information present in dictionary entries is intended to facilitate the use of the system as part of a more general GPSG-based program. In developing our prototype, we have adopted many of the proposals made in that work. To that extent, certain assumptions about a correct analysis of English sentence syntax are built in to the lexlcal entries, but this should not preclude adaptation by users to suit different analyses.","Following what has become a general assumption in syntactic theory, we take the major lexlcal categories to be partitioned into four classes by the two binary-valued features [+ N] and [:k V]. The major lexlcat categories have phrasal projections; these are distinguished from their lexlcal counterparts by their value for the feature BAR. Lexlcal categories have the value 0, and phrasal categories (including sentences) have the value 1 or 2. Thus, a Noun Phrase is of the category:","((V -) (N +) (BAR 2)) In our analysis, 'bound morphemes', that is to say prefxes and suffixes, are distinguished from others by their BAR specification; tile suffix ing is the sole member of the category:","((V 4-) (N -) (VFORM ING) (BAR -1)) As in other GPSG-based work, our analysis encodes the subcategorlzational prbpertles of lexlcal Items in the value of a feature SUBCAT. Transitive verbs such as devour are specified as (SUBCAT NP), and Intransitives such as elapse as (SUBCAT NULL).","As an example from the current analysis of how the system can operate to produce well-formed words, consider the familiar fact of English morphology that no word may contain more than one imqection. The word grammar must permit both walked and walking, but not walkinged. This is achiev~xi by restricting the distribution of inflectional suffixes so that they attach to non-Inflected stems only. A general statement of this type of restriction is made in terms of a feature INFL: stems specified as (INFL +) may take an lnflecUonal sulfix, while those specified as (INFL ~) may not. The STEM feature described in section 4 provides one means of enforcing correct stem-affix combinations; if the suffixes ed and ing are specified with (STEM ((INFL +))), they 277 will attach only to categories which Include the specification (INFL +). Walk, as a regular verb, is so specified;"]},{"title":"wallced","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"waltcing","paragraphs":["are therefore accepted. Ed,"]},{"title":"ing,","paragraphs":["other tnfectlonal suffixes, and irregular (i.e. unlnflectable) words, however, are specified as (INFL -). Our grammar assigns a binary structure to the words in question. In order for this method to prevent e.g. walk-"]},{"title":"inged,","paragraphs":["the stem"]},{"title":"walking","paragraphs":["must also bear the (INFL -) specification. This it does, since we regard sutfixes as being the head of a word, and as contributing to the categorial content of the word as a whole. If the INFL specification of the suf~x is copied into the mother category, the STEM specification of a further suffix will not be satisfied. See section 4 for more discussion of these matters. 3. The Lexicon The lexicon itself consists of a sequence of entries, each in the form of a Lisp s-expression. An entry has five elements: (1) and (ii) the head word, in its written form and in a phonological transcription, (ill) a 'syntactic field', (iv) a 'semantic field', and (v) a 'user field'. The semantic field has been provided as a facility for users, and any Lisp s-expression can be inserted here. No significant semantic information is present in our entries, beyond the fact that e.g."]},{"title":"better","paragraphs":["and best are related in meaning to good.","Similarly, the user feld Is unexploited, being occupied in all cases by the atom 'nil'. It serves primarily as a place-holder, in that, while it is desirable to maintain the possibility for users to include in an entry whatever additional information they desire, the form which that Information might take in practice is clearly not predictable.","The syntax field consists of a syntactic category, as defined by Gazdar et al. (1985), i.e. a set of feature-value pairs. Some of these are relevant only to the workings of the word grammar, and may thus be Ignored by other components In an integrated natural language processing system. Their purpose is to control the distribution of morphemes in complex words, as described in the following section.","The content of a syntax field is often at least partlally predictable. This fact allows us to employ as an aid to users wishing to write their own dictionary rules which add information to the lexicon during the compilation process. Recall that, in our analysis of English, the lnflectablllty of a word is governed by the value in that word's category for INFL. Completion Rules (CRs) can be written that will add the specification (INFL-) to any entry already Including (PLU +) (for e.g."]},{"title":"men),","paragraphs":["(AFORM ER) (for e.g."]},{"title":"worse),","paragraphs":["(VFORM ING), etc,, thus removing the need to state Individually that a given word cannot be inflected.","A second means of reducing the amount of preparatory work is provided in the form of Multiplication Rules (MRs). Whereas CRs add further specifications to a single entry, MRs have the effect of Increasing the number of entries In some principled way. One application of MRs Is to express the fact that nouns and adjectlves do not subcategorize for obligatory complements. A MR can be written which, for each entry containing the specification (N +) and some non-NULL value for SUBCAT, produces a copy of that entry where the SUB-CAT specification is replaced by (SUBCAT NULL).","The lexicon complies Into two files, one holding morphemes stored in a tree-shaped structure (cf. Thorne et 278 al. (1968)), and the other holding the expanded entries relating to them. The comptlatlon of a lexicon can take a considerable amount of time; our prototype incorporates a lexicon with approximately 3500 entries, which complies In approximately ninety minutes. 4. The Word Grammar The internal structure of words is handled by a unification feature grammar with rules of the form: mother -~ daughter 1 daughter 2 ... where 'mother', 'daughtcrl', etc. are categories. A rule which adds the plural morpheme to a noun might be given as shown below:","((BAR 0) (V -) (N +) (PLU +) (INFL -)) => ((BAR 0) (V -) (N +) (INFL +)) ((BAR -1) (V -) (N 4-) (PLU 4-) (INFL -)) The system provides two methods of writing rules in a more general form; variables and feature-passing conventions.","In our grammar, the category and inflectabllity of a suffixed word are determined by the category and lnflectablllty of the suffix; in the rule below, ALPHA, BETA, and GAMMA are variables ranging over the set of values {+, -}:","((V ALPHA)(N BETA)(INFL GAMMA)(BAR 0)) => ((BAR 0)) ((V ALPHA)(N BETA)(INFL GAMMA)(BAR -1)) Since variables are interpreted consistently throughout a rule, the mother category and suffix will be identical In their specifications for N, V and INFL.","As an alternative to variables, feature passing conventions are also available. These relate categories in what Gazdar et al. (1.985) term 'local trees', i.e. sections of morphological structure consisting of a mother category and all of Its immediate daughters. The conventions refer to 'pre-lnstantlatlon' features; these are features present in the categories mentioned In the relevant rule. 'Extension' and 'unification' are meant In the sense of Gazdar et al. (1985), q.v. The Word-Head Convention:","After lnstantlatlon, the set of WHead features in the","mother is the unification of the pre-lnstantlatlon","WHead features of the Mother with the pre-","lnstantlatlon WHead features of the Rlghtdaughter. This convention is analogous to the simplest case of the Head Feature Convention in Gazdar et at. (1985). Although there is no formal notion of 'head' in the system, this convention embodies the Implicit claim that the head in a local tree is always the right daughter. If the daughters are a prefix and a stem (as in e.g."]},{"title":"re-apply),","paragraphs":["the WHead features of the stem are passed up to the mother. Features encoding morphosyntactic category can be declared as members of the WHead set, and"]},{"title":"re-apply","paragraphs":["is then of the same category as, and shares various sentence-level syntactic properties with,"]},{"title":"apply.","paragraphs":["If the daughters are a stem and a suffix, the category of the mother Is determined not by the stem, but rather by the suffix. For example,"]},{"title":"possible","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"ity","paragraphs":["may be combined to form"]},{"title":"possibility,","paragraphs":["whose 'nountness' is due to the category of the suffix. The Word-Daughter Convention: (a) If any WDaughter features exist on the Right-","daughter then the WDaughter features on the","Mother are the unification of the pre-lnstantlaUon","WDaughter features on the Mother with the pre-","lnstantlatlon WDaughter featm-es on the Right-.","daughter. (b) If no WDaughter features exist on the Right-","daughter then the WDaughter features on the","Mother are the unification of the pre-lnstantiatlon","WDaughter features on the Mother with the pre-","lnstantlation WDaughter features on the Left-","daughter. The subcategorlzation class of a word remains constant under Inflection, but is likely to be changed by the attachment of a derlvatlonal suffix. Moreover, the subcategorization of a prefixed word is the same as that of its stem. The WDaughter convention is designed to reflect these facts by enforcing a feature correspondence between one of the daughters and the mother. When the feature set WDaughter is defined as including the subcategorlzation feature SUBCAT, the convention results in configuratkms such as:","((SUBCAT NP)) ((SUBCAT NP))","((V +)(N +]) ((SUBCAT NP))","((SUBCAT NP)) ((VFORM ING)) which show the relevant feature specifications in local trees arising from suffixatton of an adjective with +ize to produce a transitive verb and suffixatlon of a transitive verb with +ing to produce a present participle. The Word-Sister Convention:","When one daughter is specified for STEM, the","category of the other daughter must be an extension","of the value of STEM. The purpose of this third convention is to allow the subcategorization of affixes with respect to the type of stem they may attach to. The behavlour of affixes that attach to more than one category can be handled naturally by giving them a suitable specification for STEM. If it is desired to have anti- attached to both nouns and adjectives, for example, the specification (STEM ((N +))) will have that effect, since both adjectives and nouns are extensions of the category ((N +)1.","The user can define the sets WHead and WDaughter as he wishes, or, by leaving them undefined, avoid their effects altogether. The feature STEM is built in, and need not be defined. The effects of the Word-Sister Convention can be modified by changing the STEM specifications ill the lexlcal entries, and avoided by omitting them. 5. The Spelling Rules The rules are based on the work of Koskennlemt (1983a, 1983b, Karttunen 1983), though their application here is solely to the question of 'morphographemlcs'; the more general morphological effects of Koskenniemi's rules are produced dlffenmtly. The current version of the system contains a compiler allowing the rules to be written in a high level notation based on KoskennIemi (1985). Any number of spelling rules can be employed, though our system has fifleen. They are compiled during the general dictionary pre-processlng stage into deterministic finite state transducers, of which one tape represents the lexlcal form and the other the surface form.","The following rule describes the process by which an additional e is Inserted when some nouns are suffixed with the plural morpheme +s: Epenthesls +:e <=~> { < s:s h:h > s:s x:x z:z } --- s:s or < c:c h:h2> .... s:s The epenthests rule states that e must be inserted at a morpheme boundary if an(:[ only if the boundary has to its left sh, s, x, z or eh and to Its right s. The Interpretation of the rule Is simple; the character pair ('lexical character:surface character') to the left of the arrow specifies the change that takes place between the contexts (again stated in character pairs) given to the right of the arrow. Braces ('{','}') Indicate disjunction and angled brackets Indicate a sequence, Alternative contexts may be specified using the word 'or'. IJexlcal and surface strings of unequal length can be matched by using the null character '0', and special characters may be defined and used in rules, for example to cover the set of alphabetic characters representing vowels.","The spelling rules are able to match any pair of character strings. It would for example be possible to analyse the suppletlve went as a surface form corresponding to the lexlcal form go+ed. In this case, four rules would be needed to effect the change, and a better solution is to list went separately In the lexicon. in practice, the choice between treating this type of alternation dynamically, with morphological and spelling rules, and statically, by exploiting the lexicon directly, depends on the user's Idea of which is the more elegant solution. While elegance may be in the eye of the beholder, computational efficiency is mffortunately not. I[ will generally be more efficient to list a word In the lexicon titan to add spelling or morphological rules specific to small number of cases.","Rel'el'ellCCS","Gazdar, G., E. Klein, G.K.
