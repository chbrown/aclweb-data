This method depends on the extraction of word relations, patterns of which are obtained by structuring the dependency relations in sentences called Kakari-Uke relation in Japanese. As the first step of this approach, an experiment of a word classification utilizing those patterns was made on tile 4178 sentences of real language data. A system was made to analyze dependency structure of sentences uti 1 izing the knowledge base obtained through this word classification and the effectiveness of the knowledge base ~4as evaluated. To develop this approach further, the relation matrix which captures multiple interaction of words is proposed. 1. Introduction","In natural language processing, one of the major problems to be solved is how to describe linguistic and semantic knowledge in the sye]tem. If we nse no particular technique and capture the behavior in real I anguage as i t i s, the number of FU]es. concepts and relations to be arranged may expand so much° But those things contain all essential and primitive elements of language that we want to find out at ]east. In this Paper, it is considered to extract primitive elements from real linguistic behavior, and apply the elements to analysis sentence. As the above-mentioned elements, we use a relation between words. (lt is called Kakari-Uke relation in Japanese.)"]},{"title":"SUBJ John opened the door vith this ke~, t NST Fig.l 9ependency Relation Structure (Kakari-Uke Relations)","paragraphs":["2. Clustering of Words 2.1. Clustering Method","The process of the word classification based on the pattern of relations is done as follows. First, numbers of sentences are provided and Kakari-Uke relations are given to them. We call those sentences text data. Next we get the source side and the sink side pattern of relations for each word appearing in the text data. Then we calculate a distance between words. The d i s lance i s defi ned as a correspondence between the patterns themselves and the frequency of each relation making the patterns. Words are classified by a clustering algorithm using this distance. The distance has two types; one for the source side patterns and the other for' the sink side patterns. For each word, two clustering processes are applied corresponding to those two types ot distances. In this paper, the dependency strt.lcture is called as the knowledge base. 2.2. Re.sul {s","We made an experi ment of word clustering on the 4178 sentences of text data quoted from computer manuals. In this experiment, a special treatment was taken for compound words to ensure information. There are many compound words in Japanese sentences which are made by combining words and act as one word. They are called Fuku9ogo in Japanese. If we great them all as different from each other, many words appear rarely, so that the relating pat.terns of each word cannot be captured sufficiently. Because of this reason, we adopled a mechanism that replaces compound words by a normal one including the same meaning grammatical roles in grammar as the former. This mechanism can work automatically as a part of the system.","As tile result of this experiment, it was observed as expected that semantically related words tend to be combined, ttowever, some words which have different meaning are combined with a well classified word group, and several well classified groups are combined. Not only synonyms, but also the words similar in some parts as the extension of tile words, and also the words which have a common part in the upper concept tend to be combined. It is interesting that antonyms tend to be combined with each other. It was also found that words contained in the same group belong to the same part of speech almost always. 253 3. Sentence Analysis 3.1. Sentence Analysis System ESSAY","We made ESSAY (Experimental System of Sentence Analysis) which analyzes the dependency structure using the knowledge base. We show the outline of this system in Fig.2. Using the knowledge base, ESSAY analyzes the dependency structure of sentences, if those patterns are used 3ust as they were obtained :from the text data, they can only cover the relations which have appeared in the text data. But the clustering process allows the system to cover more relations than appeared in the text data. ,\";U, Sentences i"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["G ....

An Experiment","We made an experiment of sentence analysis with ESSAY. The knowledge base was organized from the 4i78 sentences of text data quoted from computer manuals. The input sentences we provided for the test were not contained in the sentences used for knowledge base organization. A sample of the analysis result is shown in Fig.3. There is a possibility that a Bunsetu (a kind of phrase structure element) has several ways of possible division into words and Euzokuqo. The system tests some combinations of those divisions. In this figure, EVAL POINT indicates the value evaluated for each structure that is calculated from the likelihood of each relations constructing the structure, we can express the conclusion as follows: t_ .-","(u l_ o .t~ ¢u ~-tn ~N o N I O0|r ---,'--- v i thou t Us i n~ ruzoku-Ko ~f I ~ --'--Us,rig Fu2oku-~o'1"]},{"title":"01 77.","paragraphs":["40- /Ax, ' \" x,~ 1 2O 0"]},{"title":"iO01","paragraphs":["~.~\"\"-. = .= 50~ ~ ', ,, ."]},{"title":"0L_ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I0 Sentence Length (Nulber of Bunsetsu) $1: The experiment us done under tt~o conditions ustn8 and ulthout using Fuzoku-$o for Inalysis in order to exulne the effect of Fuzoku-go. $2: Tim rate at uhlch the analysts succeeds. $3: The order of correct candidate In the a~lysis results. $&: The rate at vhlch the correct candidate is ranked first. Fig.4 Analysis Results of every Sentence Length","paragraphs":["a) There is a problem that the long sentence with many Bunsetu often makes too many combinations of relation candidates. b) There are some cases that no result is obtained because only a part of words does not have a relation candidates although all of others have the correct relations, c) It is difficult to describe a parallel relation using relations between two words. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze a sentence containing parallel relations. d) The rate at which the analysis succeeds depends on the length of the sentence. As the sentence becomes longer, the rate becomes lower. The average of the rate was about 40 per cent. This result is shown in FIg.4. 4. More ComplicaLed Data Structure","ESSAY decides the relations according to the connection only between two words. The other parts of the sentence take no role in this decision at all. But the relations complicatedly interact to one another in actual sentences. In this section, we describe how to deal with the interaction of the relations to provide a wider ground for judging propriety of relations."]},{"title":"(he) (to school) (by bus) (goes) ~t~;t ~-~*, 6 ~ ~? < (he) (to school) (at 6 o'clock) (goes) (a) RI R2 R3 R,l 1 1 / R1 R2 R3 R~","paragraphs":["(b)"]},{"title":"Fig.5 Relation Natrix","paragraphs":["4.1. Co-occurrence of Relations","There are word~ relating to more than two other words at the same time. As shown in Fig.5(a), four kinds of relations appear in the text data. If more than two kinds of relations appear at the same time, the frequency of relations are counted. Then frequency table is expressed by a matrix called relation matrix shown in Fig.5tb). The element Mii means frequency of Ri itself, and tim element Mij means frequency of appearance of both Ri and RJ at the same time. This matrix is obtained for each word that have been reIated with more than two words at the same time. Utilizing this matrix, we can get wider ground for .judging propriety of relations. When the relation \"go -(to1- school\" is obvious, seeing element M2i and Mi2 (i#2) of the matrix, we can gel probability of each relation Ri in this situation. 4.2. Effect of the relation Matrix","Using this matrix, the ground for judging propriety of the relations becomes wider' and the number of candidates can be effectively redticed. Secondly, because each relation becomes more reliable, it is expected to get relations according to the sentence meaning. 5. Conclusion","We haw?. introduced a bottom tip approach of organization for a linguistic knowledge base. For the organization of knowledge bas e, con t i nuous human ef for t has been required. The vocabulary of the knowledge base depends on the quantity of text data.","l,inguistic knowledge base organized in this manner may not be .so powerful as tho.~e constructed analylically. But such method may open an automatic w~iy of the knowledge acquisition and there may be a possibil ty to discover rules and properties which we have never noticed."]},{"title":"REFERENCE","paragraphs":["[1J Bobrow, D.G., and Winoqrad, T. 1977.
