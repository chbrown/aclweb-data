The obligatory cases must be generated but may be omitted in the surface string in case of elliptic utterances whereas optional deep cases need not be generated at all. In the combinations slot it is represented which deep cases may be generated together (e.g. for the verb fahren (drive) it is not allowed to generate a single SOURCE but instead SOURCE and GOAL must be generated). The Lot-preps slot specifies the prepositions which may be used with the verb iiberholen to generate locative expressions.","The case descriptions in the obligatory and optional slots consist of two parts: a declaration of an identifier for the case expression on the language side, and a predicate (in general a list of predicates) relating the case expression to the scene data. The most important predicates are REF, TIME-REF, and LOC-REF.","REF generates referring phrases for internal object descriptors like BMW1. TIME-REF generates the tense of the verb. As descriptions are usually given in present tense, presently TIME-REF only generates this tensc. LOC-REF relates the abstract location of the object as given by its coordinates to a natural language expression for a reference object. Note, that REF has to be used to generate a referring phrase for the reference object. Consider the sixth entry of the database in section 2. The instantiation only contains internal identifiers for objects, like traflic-lightl, for which referring phrases have to be generated (see section 4 for further details on REF).","In NAOS we use a specialization hierarchy for motion verbs. This hierarchy is pragmatically motivated and is rooted in situational semantics. It is no hierarchy of motion concepts as the one proposed in [23]. It connects general verbs witb more special ones.

The underlying question is: Which optional deep cases should be selected to restrict the hearer's possibilities of placing the trajectory of an object in his internal model of the static background of the scene?","In NAOS the selection algorithm answering the above question is rather straightforward. It is based on the manner of action of the verb, the verbtype, and the heater's knowledge. The algorithm is graphically represented in figure 2.","EVENTTYPE NON-DURATIVE, INCHOATIVE","DURATIVE Tl,,o = EB A T,,,a = SE Tb,~ = SB ̂T,,,d ¢~ SE T~,~ ~- S B A T,,d = S E","VERBTYPE DIR LOC RED DIR,LOC RED RED","DIR, STAT LOC STAT DIR, REO LOC STAT DIR LOC RED DEEP CASES LOCATIVE?","DIRECTION?, LOCATIVE?

If an inchoative event like losfahren (start moving) has to be verbalized which has the verbtype locomotion, then choose direction? and locative? as deep cases. The question mark generally means, look into the partnermodel Lo see whether this deep case has already been generated fi)r another event. If so, determine by use of the object's actual location (represnnted in the scene representation) whether it is still valid. If this is the case don't generate a uatural language expression for this deep case, otherwise do.","Presently the partnermodel contains information about the static background of the scene and about what has been said so far in the same relational notation as was shown for instantiations in section 2. It is being updated when an event is verbalized.","Note, that for durative events the decision is based on whether the start and end time of the event coincide with the beginning or ending of the image sequence. Consider the first case for durative events as given in figure 2. Right from the beginning of the sequence there is a car moving along a street until the sequence ends. In such a case it is not possible to verbalize a source as the object may have started its motion anywhere. To restrict the hearer's visualization, direction and locative cases are verbalized, leading to a sentence like: The car moves on Schliiterstreet in direction of HaHerplace. Verbalizing a direction when the static background is known restricts the trajectory to being on one side of the road. Basically, our direction case is a goal or source ease where only two prepositional phrases are allowed, the German phrases in Richtung and aus Richtung (in direction~ from direction). These phrases do not imply that the motion ends at the goal location as do most prepositional phrases in German which have to be in accusative surface case to denote a goal. The English language is in this respect inherently ambiguous. In the sentence The car moves behind the truck, the phrase behind the truck may denote a locative or goal deep case. In German these eases arc distinguished at the surface. [\"or locative the above sentence translates to Des Aitto f~hrt hinter dem LKW, for the goal case, it translates to Des Auto f~hrt hinter den LKW.","We have to distinguish different verbtypes as e.g. the meaning of a directional phrase changes with the verl)type. Consider the sentences The car moves in direction of Hallerplace versus The car stands in direction of l[allerplace (in German both sentences arc well formed). The first sentence denotes the direction of the motion whereas the second one denotes the orientation of I, hc car. We thns distinguish between static (STAT) and h)eomotion (LOC) verbs. The third verbtype, directional (I)IR), is used for verbs with a strong directional component like umkehren (return), abbiegen (turn off), etc. As they already imply a certain direction the additional verbalization of a direction using a prepositional phrase does usually not lead to acceptable sentences. The fourth type (REO) is used tbr verbs like erreichen (reach s. th.) having an obligatory locative case.","The main result to note here is that the selection processes are low-level and verboriented. The only higher level goal is to inform the hearer and to convey as ranch information about an event as possible. In the next section we show by differem; verbalizations of the same scene how rather complex syntactic structures arise."]},{"title":"5 Generation","paragraphs":["The general scheme for the generation process is as follows:","1.

Two temporally consecutive events are not verbalized using a temporal adverb as in the cases of inclusion and overlapping. This is due to the fact that from the linear order of the sentences the hearer usually infers consecutivity.","The result of the above algorithm is a formal representation of the surface sentence which, rougidy, contains the w~rb's stem, gemls verbi, modality, and person, all deep cases in random order, and all stems of the [exical entries which appear in the surface sentence. This representation is taken as input by the system SUTRA (for further details on the formal represeutation and the SUTRA system see [41) which then generates a correctly inflected German sentence.","Below is an example of the output of NAOS.","18. ,ausgabe text","DIE SZENE EN'rHAELT VIER BEWEGTE OBJEKTE: DREI PKWS UND EINEN FUSSGAENGER.","The scene consists of four moving objects: three vehicles and a pedestrian.","EIN GRUENER VW NAEHERT SICtt DEM GROSSEN FUSSGAENGER AUS RICHTUNG tIALLERPLATZ.

As can be seen from the example text objects are characterized by their properties, introdueed with indefinite noun phrases when they are not single representatives of a class and they may also be pronominalized to add to the coherence of the text. Therefore we use standard techniques as e.g. described in [8], [9].","We want to stress one aspect of our referring phrase generator, namely its capability to generate restrictive relative clauses with motion verbs. As it may be easily the ease that a scene contains two objects with similar properties the task arises to distinguish them and generate unequivocal referring expressions.","It is an interesting fact, that, we have several options to cope with this problem which each have their consequences.","One option is to adopt McDonald's scheme of generation without precisely knowing what to say next [13]. According to this scheme two similar objects are characterized in the following way in NAOS. When the first one is introduced it is characterized by it's properties e.g. a yellow VW. When the second one has to be introduced, REF notices that a yellow VW is already known to the partner and generates the phrase another yellow VW. It starts getting interesting in subsequent reference. The objects are then characterized by the events in which they were involved earlier whether as agent or in another role. This leads to referring phrases like the yellow VW, which receded from the pedestrian or the yellow VW, which has been overtaken. Note, how passive relative clauses arise naturally from the task of generating referring phrases in this paradigm. The same is also true for negation. Consider the case where the first yellow VW, say VWI, has passed an object and the second yellow VW, say VW2, has overtaken an object and both event,s are already known to the partner. If REF has to generate again a referring phrase for VWI it notices that pass is a more general verb than overtake and may thus also be applied for the overtake event. It therefore generates the phrase the yellow VW, which has not overtaken the other object to distinguish it unequivocally from VW2,","Below is an example of this strategy in a texL for the same scene as above.

As this domain is rich enough to still pose a 1ol; of problems I, his opens up l, he ol)portunity t,o inl;egral;e higher level sl, rabelJies for e.g. combining sentences, selecting evengs, generating deie~ie expressions, el;e.","The main difference between NAOS and other systems for language generation is that, we approach the verbalization problem from the visual side. and thus are led to use basic selection algoril;hms. Other systems like TAI,ESI'iN [151, KI)S [12J, TEXT [1,t, KAMI' [l], and I1AM-ANS [1()} start their proeessi,g wibh language whereas NAOS starts with images.
