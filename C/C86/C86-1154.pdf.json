Background An american study published in Nature, 308 (1984) - evaluated cir. 9000 Japanese scientific papers. 75 percent of them are published exclusively in Japanese, only a 5th of Japanese papers are currently evaluated from Western refereeing and information services. The main conclusion of the study was, that the general opinion all important Japanese stuff would be published in English is not true, at least for the applied sciences. From this background and from the Japanese success in a lot of fields of modern technologies stems a wider interest in having access to Japanese material and in having help to overcome the language barrier.

SEMSYN - a Japanese/German translation system The project SEMSYN-83 - SEMSYN is an acronym for SEM antic SYNthesis - has produced a system for the generation of German from semantic representations. The combination of this generator with the ATLAS/g-System of the Japanese cooperation partner FUJITSU may be seen as the first Japanese to German translation system.

SEMSYN's part is to produce a correct and understandable German text for these semantic representations. 2. The overall design of the SEMSYN-Svstem SEMSYN's generation from, FUJITSU's nets to German surface structures is done in three main steps.

Generation from frame descriptions 3,1 The frame description language The formal definition of SEMSYN's frame representation is as follows:","<IKBS-DESCR> ::: (A <FRAME-NAME>) ( A <FRAME-NAME>","WITII . <SLOTS&FILLERS>) (THE <SLOT-NAME> FROM <IKBS-DESCR>)","<SLOTS&FILLERS> :== ((<SLOT-NAME> = <IKBS-DESCR>) ... ) Conceptually we distinguish the following three main classes of frames: 1. Case schemata for verb concepts or actions (among these are all those frames that have case roles as slots). 2. Concept schemata for noun concepts or \"picture producers\". 3.

The latter is stored within the semantic to German dictionary SLEX (ROsner, 1986). 3.3 Object-oriented implementation The general knowledge about possible realizations has been implemented using the FLAVOR system of the LISP machine. The classes of tile frame representation correspond to flavor classes. Realization schemata and the knowledge about the realization of roles are defined as flavor methods. This object-oriented architecture has shown to be very flexible. It supported experimenting with the system and its step-by-step improvement 3.4 Realization schemata Frame descriptions as used in SEMSYN are recurs)re structures and so is - in general - the control structure in SEMSYN's generation, In other words: the same decisions have to be redone on each level of embedding, tn embedded frames of course some decisions are already restricted by the context. What will be the syntactic form of the text generated for such a frame? At least for case schemata we have as first alternative the choice between the realization types :CLAUSE and :NG (noun group). For semantic structures from titles we used as default to generate a noun group (a toplevel case schema was lexicalised as noun). Only in a few cases we had titles that had to be generated as questions like \"What is a model of ...?'. 653 If the general syntactic form has been decided upon, there are more choices: a clause for example could be realized as an active or a passive clause. Within a noun group the attribute could be realized as a relative clause or in the form of a prepositional group. =NG as Title-Default= Ole Baoinrlussung der Zuverltuslgkeit und dar Quolttat van Software mat ainu= System zur UnterstUtzung dar Entaicklung nit einom Computer, =NG uith ~PREFER-RELATIVE-CLAUSES*: Oia BoainFluosung deP Zuvarl~saigkait und dar guallt&t van SoL=ware Bit einem Systelp Bit dam die Entgtcklung mat ainam Computar unterstGtzt gird. =CLAUSE in paeuive voice= Die Zuverl~astgkait und die Quoltt~t van So£tuara gird mit miriam System zur Untarstetzung der Entuicklung mtt oinem Computer beeinfluBt. =CLAUSE ulth anonymous Agent= Man baeinftuOt die Zuverl~saigkatt und die Quotlt§t van Software mit ainem System zur UnteratUtzuny dar Entuicklun 9 Bit album Computer. IlL: Different Realisationsror TIT-81 These decisions are done with respect to several factors. One is the type of the actually filled roles. If a case schema for example has an :OBJECT, but no :AGENT, we prefer the passive construction in a clause realization. On the other hand stylistic preferences could be another factor. In the above case a preference could be to avoid passive, so we would take the realization schema \"ACTIVE with an anonymus agent of \"man'\". In titles these preferences come from global switches. In real text they could come from the context. 3.5 Role realizations For frames without roles - the so called terminal structures - the realization is more or less the lexicalisation of the semantic symbol. After this, process control and the produced IRS structure is given back to the surrounding frame or the toplevel. If there are roles, there is some more work to be done. Some fillers of roles are realized as distinct structures of their own (mostlv noun groups). They could be uttered for themselves. Other roles only lead to changes in the IRS structure of their frame: -decision about syntactic features: fillers of a :NUMBER role may e.g. lead to the pluralization of the noun group of the modified frame. -creation of noun compounds as head of the actual nominal group: the filler of a :NAME role may become a prefix (\"alas SEMSYN-Projekt'). This holds as well for the terminal filler of a :SPECIALIZE role (variant: realization as an adjective). A negative :MODALITY could - in a noun group realization - lead to the prefix \"Nicht-'. For those frames that have roles with realizations of their own this procedure recursively repeats for the frame descrip-- tions of the fillers of those slots. For realized role fillers it has to be decided how their IRS-structure shall be integrated in the overall structure (mostly as prepositional group) and which syntactic features could additionally be inferred. 4. Inferring of missing information SEMSYN's generation modul starts from a semantic representation that was designed to be language independent. For the primitives used - especially for the semantic relations expressed by the arcs in the semantic net - this may be true. On the other hand the data delivered to us bv FUJITSU are not really universal representations. The fact that the semantic nets are derived from Japanese is recognizable if one looks at the information that is not explicitly represented. In Japanese number or definiteness of nouns or time of verbs normally is not expressed - correspondingly our data do not have semantic correlates for these features (except in the rare case when they have been expressed in the Japanese original). The Japanese reader infers the missing information from the context. In titles there is no such context available. For correct and acceptable German on the other hand we need determiners and our nouns need a number. Therefore we had to develop heuristics to reconstruct this information. Some examples of such heuristics: - a nominalized case frame has to be realized with definite article in singular (\"Die Generierun9 natQrlicher Sprache\"). - the :OBJECT role of a nominalized case frame should be realized indefinite and plural (\"Die Generierung van Titelo'), except in cases with an exception information in SLEX (\"Die Wartung van Software\"). - concepts that have a :NAME role will be realized definite and singular (\"pie Fourier-Transformation\"). If no heuristic is applicable and if no SLEX information is found we use as title defaults 'indefinite' and 'singular' (\"~=n Verfahren'). 5. Concluding remarks Our current concern is to broaden the applicability of SEMSYN's generator for German: On the one hand we are experimenting with the generation of full texts (e.g, newspaper stories), on the other hand we are extending the repertoire of feasible semantic structures that mav serve as input for the generator.
