In this paper, a large class of English declarative sentences, including post-noun-modificatlon by relative clauses, is formalized using a two-level grammar. The principal advantages of two-level grammar are: 1) it is very e~sy to understand and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural language; 2) it is formal with many well-known mathematical properties; and 3) it is directly implementable by interpretation. The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammar for natural language syntax, we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs. Because of the ease with which two-levcl grammars may express logic and their Turing computability we expect that they will also bc very snitable for future extensions to semantics and knowledge representation. 1. INTRODUCTION","Formal specifications of natural language syntax should serve as a standard definition for the syntax of the subject language. The specification must be complete, concise, consistent, precise, unambiguous, understandable, and useful to language scholars, users, and implcmentors who wish to develop a parser for the tanguagc to run on a computer. Furthermore the specification should be mathematically rigorous to the degree that an implementation of the language can be automatically derived from the specification {10]. Unfortunately many of these aims arc difficult to accomplish primarily because of the dynanric and informal nature of natural language. Formal specification is still a worthy goal to the degree allowed by present knowledge about natm'al language and iu this paper we propose a"]},{"title":"mctalanguage for","paragraphs":["specifying both syntax and semantics of natural language that has potential for satisfying these goals.

The authors do not intend to evaluate these existing methods with respect to the requirements of formal specification languages but will instead concentrate on why two-level grammars satisfy the necessary goals in a mathematically rigorous but readable and easy to understand way.

HYPERRULES FOR ENGLISH","The hyperrules of tile two-level grammar for English define the context-sensitive aspects of English syntax which can not be specified by the context-free rules ef the recta-grammar. Unlike the meta-grammar, the hyperrulss do not generate any part of the English sentence. They serve only to verify the context-sensitive conditions of the grammar. This is done by using predicates ,~ described earlier. Predicates willderive the empty string if they are satisfied and will derive nonterminal strings of useless symbols otberwise. The notim~ that tile hyperrulcs will not generate any terminal string but instead verify context-sensitive eonditions of a terminal string already generated by the context-h'ee mctarules is a nnique feature of our approach to designing two-level grammars (e.g. in contrast, see [2]). This will greatly simplify parsing two-level grammars as we will see later.","We will define two types of predicates. The first of these will be preceded by the protonotion condition and will be given explicitly in the formal grammar. As with the recta-grammar, however, there will be some rules which can not bc precisely defined in the formal system. These rules relate to qualities of the unspecified lexical elassc~ (e.g. nouns, vm'bs, etc.) and will be designated by the protonotion where. For exalnplc, the hypernotions where NOUN is singular, where VERB is past partlelple, and where NOUN and VERB agree in person and number call not bc precisely defined except by a very large number of formal rules such ms those given below: where aardvark is singular : EMPTY. where abandoned is past participle I EMPTY. where Adam and ere agree in person and number : EMPTY.","In the subseqnent discussion of hyperrules we will use the not, ation Itu to denote hyperrule number n.

TWO-LEVEL PARSIN(I","Our method of natural language specification has two-levcls: metarules for eontexVfree syntax and hyperrules for context-sensitive syntax. Similarly our method of parsing a two-level grammar requires a parser for metarules and a parser for hyperrules. Since the metarules are context-free, any of the well-known context-free paining algorithms (e.g. see [17]) may be used to derive a context-free structure of some input sentence. Context-free parsing will eliminate all sentences which do not satisfy the context-free syntax of the language but is unable to eliminate"]},{"title":"530","paragraphs":["structures which are correct in the context-free sense but incorrect with respect to context-sensitive syntax. The hyperrule parser will further reduce the set of sentences which arc considered to be grammatically valid by analyzing the context-free parse tree for context-sensitive violations.","The \"parser\" for the hyperrules is actually an interpreter developed by the authors in [4] which evaluates the hyperrules in much the same way as a progrannning language interpreter executes programs. The hyperrules are interpreted sequentially in the order that conditions are enumerated in the grammar. Interpretation proceeds by expanding the stm't notion and applying the hyperrules to all of the branches of the hypcrrule derivation tree until all of the prcdicatcs are evaluated. As interpretation proceeds, each node of the derivation tree (corrcsponding to a hypernotion) is expanded by matching it with a hyperrule lcft-hand sldc. The right-hand side of the matched hyperrule is then used to create a subtrcc for that node. Each branch of tile tree is evaluated from left to right in a prc~ordcr traversal. The English sentence is syntactically correct if and only if the resulting terminal string derived by tbe hypcrrulc tree is the empty string.","The method of writing hyperrules to derive only the einpty string greatly simplifies the parsing process. Traditionally (e.g. [2, 10]), ~wo-lcvel grammars use tile hyperrules to generate the terminal s~rings of the language with the metarules being used only to instantiatc hyperrules. For example, in our grammar the metanotion SI°NTENCE is nscd to generate English sentences which arc tben input to the hyperrules for anMysis. In other two-level grammar styles, however, the components of thc sentence would also be generated by hypcrrules. The result of hyperrules generating terminal strings is that parsing bccmnes considerably more difficult and is not accomplished without restrictions being placcd on hypcrrules (e.g. [15]). Our method of interpreting hypcrrnles places no restricl, ions, thcrclorc allowing the tlg to be more gencral. The differences in writing styles are cxplored further in I4].","The hyperrule interprctatkm algoritbm is outlined below:","Procedure EvMuute (hypcrnotion) 1.

Evaluate (hypernntion-i) for i ~= 1, 2~ .., n.","To explain how this interpreter works, consider the examplc sentence \"Professor White and the students who attend the university gave Mrs. White a present today.\" This sentence is seen to be correct, with respect to context-free syntax and its structural representation is shown in 1,'ignre 1. The specific metarules applied arc numbered. We will now apply the hyperrules to this sentence to show how the context-sensitive conditions arc verified. For notational convenience we have italicized the protonotions which correspond to metanotions in the hyperrules. Since the tree will bc traversed from left to right we will label the branches (i.e. nodes) using a nmnber (0-8) to denote the level in the tree and a letter (a-e) to indieaLe lcf~ to right ordering.","The root of the hyperrulc derivation tree is the sentence itself. [Iyperrulc HI will be applied to initiate the verification process. This will be followed by H2 which divides the derivation tree into five separate branches, one for each condition which the sentence must satisfy. 0 • Professor White and the ~tudents who attend the university gave Mrs.","White a present today. 1 • condition Professor White and the students who attend the university","gave Mrs. White a present today, is a well-formed sentence 2a * condition Professor White and the students who attend the university","ghows subject-predicate agreement with gave 2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend the nniversity is","a well-formed subject 2c • condition a present today shows object-predicate agreement with gave 2d * condition gave is a well-formed predicate 2e • condition a present today is a well-formed object","To expand branch 2a and cheek the first condition, hyperrule H3 (no anxiliary verbs) is applied. Since the subject is compound, rule H9 will be applied, requiring the verb to be plural. The \"library\" predicate will verify the plurality of gave. 2a • condition Professor White and the student8 who attend the university","shows subject-predicate agreement with gave 3a • condition Professor White and the students who attend the university","agrees in person and number with gave 4a • where gave is plural 5a •","tlyperrule H12 will be applied to expand branch 2b and decompose the compound subject into its components. IIyperrules ltl0 and Illl will then analyze each of the two respective sub-subjects for well-fm'medness. 2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend the university","is a well-formed subject 3b * condition Professor White is a well-formed subject 4b * 3c * condition the students who attend the university is a well-formed","subject 4e * condition the students is correct in premodification 4d .condition the students who attend the university is correct in","postmodifieation Proceeding to construct the trce ill a left-to-right manner, branch 4c is expanded next using hyperrule It13.

The analysis is performed by hyperrules HI9, H21, ti22 and H27.

Since there arc no auxiliary verbs, hypcrrule lt31 is satisfied. 2d • condition gave is a well-formed predicate 3e • The final condition that the sentence must satisfy is well-formcdness of the object. Since the object is a sequence, rule H34 will be applied to branch 2c to decompose tile object sequence and analyze the indirect and direct objects individually by rule H33. Rule Itaa calls rules II10-II12 recursively. Since Mrs. White is a named subject, hyperrule H10 is satisfied for tile indirect object. By applying hypcrrules [I11, II13, HI4, H16, It19 and 1120, the direct object a present will also be verified as a well-formed object. The analysis is now complete and the sentence has been determined to be correct through tile process of our twoqevel grammar interpretation method. 6. CONCLUSIONS","We have shown that two-level grammars may be used very elegantly to give a formal specification of Ignglish context-fl'ec and context-sensitive syntax. In addition to the subset we have defined in this paper, many other types of Nnglish declarative sentences have been formMly specified using two-level grammars {7]. There seems to be no obstacle to using rig specifications for any type of natural language syntactic specification.","Tile principal advantages of the two-level grammar mctManguage are: 1) it is very readable and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural language; 2) it is formal with many well-known mathematical properties; and 3) it is directly implcmentable by interpretation. The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammm' for natural language syntax, we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs. The combination of readability and implementability is unique in grammar theory for natural languages.","To give a complete spccification of natural language, semantics and knowledge representation must be specified in addition to syntax. Our future goals are the investigation of two-level grammar for semantic specification. Because of the ease with wtfich two-level grammars may express logic [6] and their Turing computability [12], we expect that tlgs will also bc very suitable for these goals.","REFERENCES","Ill Chomsky, N.
