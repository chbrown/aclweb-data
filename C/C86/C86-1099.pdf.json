BetaText can be described as an event driven pr(xluction system, in which (c~mbinations of) text events lead to certain actions, such as the printing of sentences that exhibit certain, say, syntactic phenomena. %~]e analysis mechanism used allows for arbitrarily complex parsing, but is particularly suitable for finite state i~arsing. A careful investigation of what is actually needed in linguistically relevant text processing resulted in a rather sn%all but carefully chosen set of \"elementary actions\" to be implemented. 1. Introdnction. The field of c~mputa'tior~][ linguistics seems, roughly speaking, to o~IiprJ.se two rather disjoint subfields, one J.n which the typical researcher predominantly occupies himself witJl problems such as \"concordance generation\", \"backward sorting\", \"word frequencies\" and so on, whereas the prototypic researd]er in tJ~e otJler field has things like \"parsing strategies\", \"semantic representations\" on top of his mind.","qhis division into almost disjoint subfields is to be regretted, because we all are (or should be) students of one and the same thing - language as it is. %~e responsibility for this sad state of affairs can probably be divided equal by the researchers in these two subfields: the \"concordance makers\" .~- cause they seem so entirely ha~)py with rather unsophisticated cx)raputational tools de~eloped a].reac~ in the sixties (and which allow the researcher to look at words or word forms only, and their distribution), and the theoreticians ~yecause they seem so obsessed with the idea of developing their fantastic ir~dels of ]xln(}lage in greater and greater detail, a mode], that at a closer scrutiny is found to c~Dmprise a lexicon of, at best, a couple of hundred words, and cvavering, at best, a couple of hundred sentences or so. No wonder that the researchers in these two canlos thirJ< so little of each other.","One way of closing the gap can be to develop niDre sophisticated tools for the investigation of actual texts; there is a need for die theoreticians to test to what extent their models actually cover actual language (and to get impulses from actual language), and there is a need for the \"practicioners\" to have simple tools for investigating snore complex st[llctures in texts than mere words and word :totals. BetaText is an attempt to provide tools for both those needs. 2. Text events and text oiyerations. BetaText is a system intended both for scientific investigations (or analyses) of texts, and text processing in a i~ore technical sense, such as reformattlng, washing spurious characters away, and so on. Due to the internal organisation of the system, even large texts can [se run at a reasonable cost (of. Brodda-Karlsson ±98i). In this section we give some general definitions, and show their consequences for Beta-Te xt. i~i elementary (text) event consists of the observation of one specified, concrete string in the text. The systera records sudl an observation through the introduction of a specific internal state (oz through a specific change of the internal state), the internal state being an internal variable that can take arbitrary, positive integral values.","/Lrbitrarily chosen states (sets of states, in fact.) can be tied to specific activities (or pro cesses), and each time such a state is intro duced (i.e. the internal state becomes equal to that state) the corresponding process is aeti vated. Such states are called action states.","A complex event (or just event, even elementary events can be. cor~lalex in the sense used here) is the c~3mbined result of a sequence of interconnected elementary events, possibly resulting in an action state.","In BetaText all this is coi~pletely controlled by a set of prEx~uction rules (cf. Smullyan 196].) of the type~","(<striug>, <set of states>) -> ( <slew string>, <move>, <new state>, <action(s) >) where <string> is the string that is to be observed, <set of states> a condition for applying the rule, viz. that the current inter]lal state belongs to this set; it is via such conditions that the chaining of several elementary events into one con~91ex event is achieved. <new string> is a string that is substituted for the observed string (the default is that the original string is retained), <move> is a directive to Che system w'here (in the text) it shall continue the analysis; the default is immediately to"]},{"title":"421","paragraphs":["the right of the observed string. <new state> is the state that the application of the rule results in. <action(s)>, finally, is the set of actions that are invoked through the application of the rule; the action part of a rule is only indirectly present, as the actions are invoked if the resulting state of the rule belongs to the corresponding action sets.","The actual rule format also allows for context conditions (and not only state conditions as is indicated above), h/t it is the way state conditions are evaluated that makes the Beta formalism as strong as it is; cf. Brodda-Karlsson 81 and Brodda 86. 3. internal organiT~tion. The text corpus to be analyzed is assumed to adhere to a format that ,~re or less has become the international standard, where each line of the running text is assumed to be preceded by a fixed length line head, usually containing some k~id of line identifier. (Typically a doct~nerrt identifier + a running line enumeration.) ~ne running text is presented to the user (well, the program) as if consisting of one immensely long string (without the line heads) and in which the originnl line divisions are represented by number signs (or some other unique symbol not appearing otherwise in the text). %~e original line heads are also lined up in an internal queue, and the correspondence between lines and line heads is retained via pointers. (This is completely hidden for the user. )","%~e system has (or can be thought to have) a cn/rsor that is moved to and fro inside the text. At start up, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the text, and the internal state is initiated to l~ from there on, the user has complete control (via the application of rules) of the cursor and the internal state. (The the cursor is, however, autoi~tically moved rightwards in the text as long as there is no rule applicable.)","Output is again organized in the line head, text line format, but now the line head may be given an internal structure, viz. as <-kwoc-fie Id-> <-id-field-> <-enum- field-> where the id-field corresponds to the line head of the input text, the kwoc-field may be filled with material from the text itself (e.g. words if one is making a word concordance of the KWOC-type), and the ent~n(eration)-field, if defined, contains a running entuneration. These fields - if defined - must be explicitly filled with corresponding material, through the application of action rules, which we describe in the next section. 4. Actions. The actions that can be invoked through the applications of rules can be divided into four different groups~ i) analysis actions, actions that"]},{"title":"422","paragraphs":["control in detail how the analysis proceedes in-ternally; ii) block and line head actions, actions through which one can move material from the text into the line head (and vice versa); iii) outl~It (or print) actions, actions which result in some kind of output, and, finally, iv)count actions.","q%le analysis actions control how the analysis is to proceed internally. In an accumulating rule the resulting state is added to (or subtracted from) the current internal state, rather than assigned to it (which is the default case). In stack rules some important internal parameters (internal state and the present positions of the cursor and the flag; cf. below) are pushed onto or popped from an internal stack. %~rough the use of stack actions ATNlike grammars can ~ writtern very conveniently in the Beta formalism (cf. Brodda 86.)","Block and line head actions: A flag setting action implies that an internal pointer is set to the present position of the cursor. The flag can later be the target of move directives (i.e. the cursor can be moved back to the flag). The area from the flag to the current position of the cursor can also be moved out into the kwoc-field as one block in a kwoc action.","In output actions the output can be forn~tted in n~ny convenient ways. in kwic-format, for instance, always exactly one line at a time is output, and in such a way that the cursor is positioned in a fixed co itu~In.","BetaText has not in itself any advanced statistical apparatus, but one can at least count things, and perhaps in a little bit more advanced way than is usually the case. Arbitrary sets of states can be assigned specific registers (up to ]28 such sets can presently be defined), and ~henever any of these states is introduced, the correslxgnding register is raised by one. The content of the registers are then presented in a log file that acconloanies all sessions with Beta'l~xt.","Several examples of actual analyses will k~ shown at the conference.","RE ~7~h~N C~I~ :","Brodda, B. & Karlsson, i.'. \"An Experiment with Auton~tic Morphological Analysis of Finnish\", Del~rt~f~ent of Linguistics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki 1981.","Brodda B. \"~ Experiment with Heuristic Parsing of Swedish\" in Papers from the Seventh Sc6~idinavian Conference of Linguistics, Publications No. 10, Department of Linguistics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki 1983.","Brodda, B. \"Beta%%xt: 7~i event Driven Text Processing System and Text Analyzing System\", to appear in Papers ~om the ~Ehglish Language and Literature department, University of Stockholm, Stockholm 1986.","Sn~llyan, R.M. \"Theory of Formal Systems\", Annals of Math.
