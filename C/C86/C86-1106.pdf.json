Introduction","Automatic identification of homonyms in kana-to-kanji conversions systems and of multivocal words in machine translation systems cannot be sufficiently implemented by the mere combination of grammer and word dictionaries. This calls for a new concept of knowledge data. What the new knowledge data is and how it can be acquired are mentioned in the paper. In natural language research, active discussion has been make within the framework of knowledge and samples of knowledge.","2. Phases of Natural Language Study and Knowledge Data [phase 1]","In the initial phase when natural language had not been fully clarifiedj the authors made an attempt to analyze the language with the help of word dictionaries and grammar alone, and to build a new system from the results. We, however, encountered a great number of homonyms in kana-to-kanji conversion, as well as multivocal words and other problems in machine translation. This was because the grammar and dictionaries were too simple. In other words, w i + /T(~i) where ~i is a word and /T is a conversion system. [phase 2]","There are some possible means for solving the problems encountered in Phase i. They include the following: analyze the word frequency, limit the number of words in use, limit the contents of the words in use, limit the fields and limit sentences. This helps remove, or at least minimize, homonyms, multivoeal words and ambiguities. A system with limitations, however, involves too many difficulties to be readily accepted. [phase 3]","In vocabulary, no words are used independently. One should define and use words by clarifying the characteristics, coverage and conditions of words. This may be expressed as follows: ~i I Pi I ' Pi2 'Pi~ ' ..... ' Pin ÷ /T(~i I Pil 'Pi2 ........ Pin ) =yj where ~i is a word; and Pil' Pi2' ..... ' Pin are the limitations of ~i\" The set of Pil' Pi2 ~ ..... ' Pin should be low in number and simple.","Different approaches have already been proposed as to what is necessary for clarifying the conditions for the coverage of words in Phase 3. Some examples are semantic markers, semantic categories and thesaurus. However, the author~ put emphasis on the relationship of words, though recognizing such other forms of approach. [Knowledge Obtained from Words]","Words and sentences provide knowledge shown in Table I, from simple to complicated in order. How much of them are usable as dictionaries (books)? How much are usable as machine-readable dictionaries?","In Table I, machine-readable dictionaries have already been established for I. \"Word-related Attributes\". Classified vocabulary lists have been prepared for Thesaurus Structure in 2~ but there is almost nothing for the other attributes.","Therefore, an attempt to build a sophisticated system would be unsuccessful if no basic knowledge data is available."]},{"title":"448","paragraphs":["Table I.

Is it Possible to Define Word Coverage and Conditions? Since every word may be linked with an infinite number of words, one may wonder if it is impossible to define word coverage and conditions. It would also take a great deal of time and trouble to examine all the words that are almost infinite in number. If, however, one actually examines some of tlle words, we will fine that every word is linked with a limited number of words. Table 2.

The function as a means of eo~imnication and the characteristics of tile telephone are unique to the telephone. In this particular meaning, it is a simple and finite task to count the different relationships between words. It is, however, extremely difficult to count the word-to-word relationships for the general meanings such as a substance and a place. However, it is possible to organize the major relationships without much effort. The only approach would be to tabulate the words having peculiar relationship to specific words and the relationship between specific words and words of high usage frequency, and thus use system-preset defaults for other words. Such words as \"takai\" (meaning high) and \"utsukushii\" (meaning beautiful) are used frequently. In some cases, therefore, it is difficult to determine the coverage and conditions of individual words. Such cases must include general grammar and the meaning of words most frequently used in \"takai\" and \"utsukushii\" must be defined in the word-to-word relationships together with the conditions of any special meanings of high and beautiful. Words of low frequency and high frequency are dependent on individual rules (conditions based on word-to-word relationship) and general grammar. 4, Aquisition of Knowledge data 4-1 Method by extracting and segmenting Kanji strings","Authors and S. Mizutani of Tokyo Women's Christian College mechanically extracted the four-character kanji strings from some JICST abstract files, extracted meaningful concept co~)inations from them~ and classified them into 45 categories. Thus, after examing 78,000 four character kanji strings, 28,000 different kinds of knowledge data was obtained from 32,000 types of kanji strings in net. This approach is promising because it allows easy expansion in quantity and consists mainly of mechanical processing. In addition, an attempt to reorganize a total of 887,000 data, 200,000 in net, is under way. An atten~t to apply the same idea to the three and five character kanji strings is also being made. 449 {Example] T~/~ Pv @:~. ~ T~Pv ~- • ~J~ T ga/o Pv kaicho-jinin TniyoriPv shaahin-hantei","4-2 Aquisition of knowledge data based on word-to-word synchronism","In this ease, Japanese sentences should be analyzed to extract connections and obrain knowledge data. Analysis, however, takes a great deal of time and involves ambiguity. This suggests an approach which simply extracts independent words handles them, if present in the same sentences, as candidates for knowledge data because of mutual relation, and extracts meaningful knowledge data based on frequency and manual procedure. [Example ] A boy throws a ball. boy throws b ~iI throws boy ball To extract such re~ .ships and reorganize them sequentially. 4-3 Aquisition of knowledge by syntax analysis","This is a method which analyzes the sentences that are input with word dictionaries and grammar, builds syntax element&~ extracts connections from them, and thus, extracts knowledge data. This method is theoretically pertinent but not practical because it leaves the problem of a tremendous in-creasing number of syntax trees. It would be very effective if a great amount of knowledge data were available and some of the ambiguities from syntax analysis were reduced. Since, in Japanese sentences, long-unit terms are used as they are, it is also necessary to sub-categorize them automatically. Otherwise, a variety of knowledge data would result and it would be troublesome to systematize knowledge data.","XX daigaku (university) , XY daigaku~% daigaku general terms basic concept term This sort of concept was presented by some manufacturers engaged in the research and development of machine translation. It is however only in the planning stage. There has been no news reporting 450 that knowledge data is effectively available.","Fig. 2.

Conclusion","The systemization, aquisition and construction of knowledge data are a step towards the next jump in Japanese processing systems. Indeed, the knowledge data still has a number of problems to be solved, but prospects for the future are rather bright.
