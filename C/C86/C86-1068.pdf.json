I- INTRODUCTION","In every application that concerns the automatic processing of natural language, the problem of the dictionary size is posed. We can approach this important question in several ways and particularly :","- By grouping together the common prefixes of the different language words. In the PIAF system,(interactive program for French Analysis) for instance, words are represented in chained lists following an alphabetical order [COUR 77]","EX : PARTIEL ~ PARTIES_____--~_PARTOUT ... PARTIE-~ J PART -,~--","- By creating multiple dictionaries: or:efor each major topic area. This approach requires, in addition, a common base dictionary. When a particular area is concerned, a temporary master dictionary is created by increasinF the base dictionary with selected local ones.","-- By usin~ the Affix analysis which consists in performing a morphological analysis in order to identify, in a given word, the redundant elements (Affixes). The dictionary will be limited to the non-redundant elements (roots). This technique is used specially in the DECIO - SPELL system for detecting and correcting spelling errors.","In the present paper, we will develop this last approach for the non_diacritical Arabic.","The particularities of the algorithms that we propose, stem~ in great part, form the specificities of the language used :","-","Words are written in consonantic form","-","Words can contain infixes","-","Morphological structures can be altered by","linguistic transformations.","This work has been developed within a national research project for the study of the automatic detection and correction of spelling errors in Arabic texts BEN 86 7","II - THEORETICAL ASPECTS Let V be a finite Set and V ~, the set of words built on V including nul s$ing noted W ~-V-- W = W I W 2 ......

Morphological decomposition","The Affix analysis consists in decomposing a given word into its first elements among which we can distinguish the affixes (prefix, infix and suffix) which are the redundant elements of the language and the root which is its non redundant one . 286","This decomposition is based on the derivational structure of the ]anguage : nearly all the words are obtained by adding an affix combination to a given root. suffix Infix Root Prefixes","- Root = ~"]},{"title":"ka~aba","paragraphs":["- Prefix = ~ -","Infix = ~"]},{"title":"tO -","paragraphs":["Suffix = \"&-- £","Among the possible affix comb{nations, we distinguish those that are valid and those that are not.
