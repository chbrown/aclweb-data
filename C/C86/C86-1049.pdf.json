The suitable assig~ement appearing here as the first phase is in fact the goal of the parsing. The \"brute force\" approach following the above scheme, which cheeks all possible assignements and tries to eEu~eel them is not eomputationally' tractable, since for most granmlarS the nul,ber of all possible assignements grows exponentially with the length of the analysed sentence.","The moral of this obsel~vation is that the assi~nement oaru~ot be separated from the cancellation. Similarly as parsers based on phrase - str~oture grammars have to make at each point of time an intelligent choice of rule to apply next~ the eategorial parser must m~ke an intelligen~ choice out of a list of alternative oate-n'cries. This necessity to look ahead at cancellation when making the assignement leads to the conclusion [6 ] that assi~nement and cancellation must in any' actual parser be interwoven. Therefore our second key qlles~ion reads:","Can this interweaving\" be grasped by' a simple formal model or does it unavoidingly lead to ~ mess of complicated ad hoe and heuristic teelmiques? If.

Tihe correspondence between GCGs and LA ca~ be observed not only' in the whole class of context-sensitive languag'es, but also on the level of CF-lan6~ages and in each of infinitely many' strata between CF a CS-lang~ages.
