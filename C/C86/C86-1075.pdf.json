The paper describes a solution to this problem within the theoretical framework of the Rosetta machine translation syst~n. Rosetta is an experimental trans] at]on system which uses an intermediate lard,mate and translates between Dutch, English and, in the future, Spanish. I ~nt roduet ion Idioms have been told still are a basic theoretical sttnlbling block in most linguistic theories. For the purposes of machine translation or, in genera], natural language processing, it is necessary to Ix~ able to deal with :idioms because there are so i~any of th~n in every language and because they are an essential part of it. ldioms occur in sentences as a number of words, possibly scattered over the sentence and possibly with sonde inflected el~nents; this ntnfl~er of words has to be interpreted as havip4~, one primitive meaning. For example, in (1) \"nade\", \"peace\" and \"~.Rth\" have to be interpreted idlomatically. Note that words that are part of the idJ~n are underlined. (1) lie has made his peace with his neighbour The classic example Is (2): (2) Pete kicked the bucket Literally this sentence means that Pete hit a specific vessel ~¢[th his foot. In the idiomatic reading the interpretation is that Pete died. It is impossib]e to infer this idiomatic meaning directly fron the prlm~tives \"Pete\", \"kick\", \"the\" and \"bucket\" and from the way they are eomblned. Idioms can undergo sy~itaetie transformations, but sometimes they are reluctant to do so. The passive sentence (3) has lost its idiomatic reading, while in the ~assive sentence (4) the idiomatic reading has heen retained . (3) The bucket was kicked by Pete (4) Mary's heart was broken by Pete Other examples are (5-12). In the idiomatic reading in (5) clefting with the object as focus is not allowed, while it is allowed in (6) if \"Mary\" is stressed. Clefting with the subject as focus in both (7) and (8) is permitted. In (9) the PP \"at whose door\" and in (I0) the NP \"whose heart\" can be subject to wh-movement. In (ii) the NP \"Mary's heart\" can be topicallzed (if \"Mary\" is stressed), but in (1.2) tbe NP \"the bucket\" cannot undergo this transformation without losing the idicanatic reading. Thus idioms behave syntactically like non-idiomatic structnres, although sometimes they are restricted . (5) It was the bucket that Pete Idcked (6) It was Mart's heart that Pete broke (7) It was Pete that kicked the bucket (8) It was Pete that broke Mary's heart \" (9) At whose door did Pete lay his failure (i0) those heart did Pete say that Mary broke (ll) Mary's heart Pete broke (12) The bucket Pete Icicloed Idioms can take free arguments or can have elenents, llke possessive pronotms, which have to be hound hy arguments. In sentences (13-1.5) \"Mary\" ].s a complement to the idiomatic verb, and realizes different grammatical functions in the sentence (i.e. indirect object, possessive NP and to-PP object respectively)° In (16) the pronoun \"his\" has to Im bound by the subject \"l?ete\".

The proposals made are usually fragmentary, ill the sense that they only are concerned with part of the probl~n, for instance Fraser (1970), who only deals with the possible application of transfo~vaations to idioms, or they are a relatively minor part of a larger theory, for example Chomsky (1981.), who gives a very general and prfneipled account of idioms, Nit cannot cope with all the data. More elaborate studies on idioms are usually not directly relevant to machine translation, for instance Boisset (1978), who treats idioms frc~n a more pragm~qtic lYoint of view. To illustrate it could be argued that Chomsky (1981) can cope with sentences such as (2) and (15), but not wtt:h (13), (1.4) and (16); Pesetsky (1985) can deal with (2) or (13-16), hut not with a sentence lilm: (17) Pete lald his failure a:t Mary's d_oo ~ Chonsky (198[, p. 146, note 94) claims that \"we may think of an idiom rule for an idiom with a verbal head as a rule adding the string aVc to the phrase marker of each terminal string abc, ~dmre b is the idiom, now understanding a phrase marker to be a set of strings\" and that idioms \"appear either :In D-structure or S-strncture or LF-form.\" Furthermore \"at: D-structure, idioms can be distinguished as subject or not snhject to Move alpha\".

In this approach a sentence s\" is considered a possible translation of a sentence s if s and s\" have not only the same meaning but if they also have similar derivational histories, which implies that their meanings are derived in the same way from the same basic meanings. This approach requires that \"isomorphic grammars\" are written for the languages under consideration. The term \"possible translation\" should be interpreted as \"possible in a particular context\". The discussion in this paper will be restricted to the translation of isolated sentences on the basis of linguistic knowledge only. In the following sections the notions M-gremmars, the variant of Montague grammar used in the Rosetta system, and isomorphic grammars will be introduced. For a more detailed discussion of isomorphic M-grammars the reader is referred to Landshergen (1982, 1984). In section (2.3) an example of an M-grammar will be given. 2.1 M-Gray, mrs The grammars used in the system, called M-grammars, can be seen as a computationally viable variant of Montague Grammar which is in accordance with the transformational extensions proposed by Partee (1973). This implies that the syntactic rules operate on syntactic trees rather than on strings. Restrictions have been imposed on the grammars in such a way that effective parsing procedures are possible. An M-grammar consists of (i) a syntactic, (ii) a morphological and (iii) a semantic component. (i) The syntactic component of an M-grammar defines a set of \"S-trees\". An \"S-tree\" is a labelled ordered tree. The labels of the nodes consist of a syntactic category and a list of attribute-value pairs. The branches are labelled with the names of syntactic relations, such as subject, head, object, etc. An M-grammar defi~es a set of S-trees by specifying a set of basic S-trees and a set of syntactic rules called \"M-Rule s\". An \"M-Rule\" defines a partial function from tuples of S-trees to S-trees. Starting from basic expressions, an expression can be formed by applying syntactic rules. The result of this is a surface tree, in which the labels of the terminal nodes correspond to words. This process of making an expression is represented in an M-grammar by a \"syntactic derivation tree', in which the basic expressions are labels of the terminal nodes and the names of the rules that are applicable are labels of the non-terminal nodes. In the example below (Fig. (25)), rule R I makes the NP \"the cat\" from the 'basic expression \"cat\" and rule R 2 makes the S-tree for the sentence (24) on the basis of the NP and the basic expression \"walk\" (the constructions to the left of the dotted llrms are abbreviations of ~lat the result of the application of the rule looks like). (24) the cat is walking (25) SEN%EN~ ...... R 2"]},{"title":"~z_J-- ~'~-- . /X","paragraphs":["the cat is walking"]},{"title":"/ ~","paragraphs":["~NP ......

In this way the syntactic and the n~rphological component define sentences. (iii) The sem~mtic c~nponent. M-grammars obey the compositionality principle, i.e. every syntactic rule and every basic S-tree gets a model-theoretical interpretation. For translation purposes only the names of meanings and the names of meaning rules are relevant as ~il] be shown later. The model-theoretical interpretation of the basic S-trees and the synt~tic m*les is represented in a \"s~lantic derivation tree\", which has the same ~eo~l~try as the syntactic derivation tree, hut is labelled with naales of meanings of r~es and basic expressions. An example is given below in (27). Before giving an example of an M-gramnmr in section (2.3), isomorphic M-grm~mars will be discussed. 2.2 Isomorphic M-Grammars To establish the possible translation relation the gramnars must be attuned to each other as follows: - For each basic express:ion of a gr~maar G of a language L there is at least one basic expression of a grammar G\" of a language L\" with the same meaning. - For each syntactic rule of G there is at least one syntactic rile of G ~ corresponding to the sane meaning operation. Syntactically these roles nmy differ considerably. Two sentences are defined to be (possible) translations of each other if they have derivation trees with the sm~e geometry, in which the corresponding nodes are labelled with names of corresponding rt~es and basic expressions. If this is the case then the derivation trees are isomorphic and the two sentences have the same semantic derivation tree. Grammars that correspond to each other in the way described above will be called \"isomorphic grammars\" if the corresponding rules satisfy certain conditions on application, such that for each well-fonned syntactic derivation tree in one language there is at least one corresponding well-formed syntactic derivation tree in the other language. A syntactic derivation tree is well-formed if it defines a sentence, ioe~ if the rules are applicable. The following is an illustration of these principles= X~e left part of figure (27) shows the derivation tree of sentence (26) which is the Dutch trm~slation of sentence (24). Rule R~ h~ilds the NP \"de kat\" from the basic expression \"kat' and rule R\" 2 constructs the expression \"de kat loopt\" from the NP and the basic expression \"lopen\". There is a correspondence between both the basic expressions and the syntactic rules of the two granmars. Each rule of the syntactic derivation tree is mapped onto a corresponding rule of the s~antic derivation tree and each basic expression is mapped onto the corresponding basic meaning.

However, the semantic concept basic expression does not always coincide with what one would call a syntactic primitive. This is the case, for instance, with idioms. For exmnple the idiom \"kick the bucket\" has the primitive meaning \"die', but the syntactic primitives are \"kick\", \"the\" and \"bucket\"."]},{"title":"322","paragraphs":["For reasons given in the introduction it is impossible to treat idioms as strings (i.e. syntactic primitives)° The possibility of applying syntactic transformations to (eloments of) idioms, which are also applicable to non-idiomatic constructs, suggests that idi~l~s should be treated as having complex constituent structures, which are similar to non-ldiomatic constituent structures. The possibility of having free arguments, which are realized by various grammatical functions, suggests that parts of idioms do not have to be adjacent at any level of the syntactic process. The complex idiomatic constituent structure should accommodate this. In Rosetta, before idioms were introduced, basic expressions were terminal S-trees, i.e. tenminal nodes. Idioms can be treated as basic S-trees that have an internal structure. This type of expression is an example of what will be called a \"comp]ex basic expression\" (CBE). A CBE is a basic expression from a semantic point of view, i.e. it correspands to a basic meaning, and a complex expression from a syntactic point of view, i.e. it is a non-terminal S-tree. For exmnple, the basic S~tree for \"kick the bucket\" looks like the following: (30) VERB VAN VERB V 1 \"kick\" det/~hea d / x ART NOUN \"the\" \"bucket\" By extending the notion of basic expression in this way the attuning of grammars (as defined in section (2.2)) is easJer to achieve: corresponding basic expressions may be CBE's. For ex~nple the D~itch verb \"doodgaan\" may correspond to the English idiom \"kick the bucket\". Special measures are necessary to guarantee that the rules obey the conditions on application (cf. section (2.2)). Basic expressions are listed in the basic lexicon of a grammar. A CBE is represented as a canonical surface tree structure in the lexicon. A canonical surface tree structure is the default tree structure for a certain sentence, phrase, etc., i.e. the structure to which no syntactic transformations have applied. For example: if there is a passive transformation, the canonical structure is in the active form.

These variables will be replaced by syntactic variables, when the CBE is inserted into the syntactic tree, Apart from the category VERB and the usual attribute-value pairs~ the top node contains a set of attribute-value pairs that indicates which trans= formations are possible. 3.1 Treatment of Complex Basic Expressions In this section an extension of the M-grammar of section (2.3) will be given that can deal with an interesting class of Complex Basic Expressions and t~o M-grarmnars will be related to each other according to the isomorphy approach. Some other reasons for having complex basic expressions will be given.","3.1.1 An Example of an M-grmmmar for Complex Basic Expressions In this section an M-graml~mr will be presented that generates the idiomatic sentence: (33) Pete lends the girl a band The grmmnar of section (2.3) is extended in tile following way: (i) basic S-trees VERB(V I lend V 2 a hand) (ii) M-Rules: R 9 : if t I is of the form VERB[suhj/VI,","head/~]U~B, iob~/V~] and","t 2 is of category VAR with index~i and","t 3 is of category VAR with index j","tllen: CL [ sub J/t2 ,. head/VERB,• Lobj/t 3 ] This rule expects a complex, transitive verb and two variables; it constructs a clause in which tile variables are the subject and the indirect object.

One of the basic expresJions differs. So the structures can he idiomatic or non-idiomatic and other rules of tlle M-granmmr (e.g. wh~novement or passiw[sation) are applicable to both these structures, unless, as In tile case of certain idioms, they are prohibited as indicated at the top node. 3.1.2 Complex Basic Expressions and Isomorphic Grammar~ Assume we have an M-grammar that generates the Dutch sentence (35) wldch is a translation of (33). It is then possible to let the English M-grammar given above for (33) correspond to this grmnmar in the following way: (35) Pete helpt het meisje (36) R M 6 \" R M R\"","R~ \"3 /~.~ 73 M4 73"]},{"title":"/'k","paragraphs":["\" Pete Vla ..

In this ~ray it is possible to establish a correspondence between complex basic expressions in one language and basic expressions that are not complex in another. In a similar fashion it is possible to establish a relation between complex basic expressions in one language and cc~nplex basic expressions in another. Note that in this way it is not necessary to incorporate a so-e&lled structural transfer in the machine translation syst~n for the translation of CBE\" s. 3.2 Other Reasons for Waving Complex Basic Expressions Expressions that: are not idiomatic, but that consist of more than one word can be handled by means of a c~nplex basic expression in order to retain the isomorphy. This is the case if the expression (i) corresponds to an idiom or (ii) corresponds to a word in another lmlguage. Examples are tlle follo~clng: (i) In l)utch (37) is not an idiom it* the sense defined above (i.e. the meaning of the expression \"kwaad worden\" can be composed in a natural way from \"kwaad\" and \"worden\"), but has an idiomatic equivalent in English (38). (37) kwaad worden (Eng. \"become angry\") (38) lose one's temper If \"kwaad worden\" has to correspond to \"lose one's temper\", then in a technical sense, in Dutch, \"kwaad worden\" can be treated in the s~ne way as an idiom. (ii) The Italian word (39) which translates into F.nglish (40) and Spanish (41) whieh translates into English (42) are words that correspond to complex expressions in English (and Dutch). From a translational point of view cases like \"get up early\" can be treated in the same way as idioms. (39) adagiare (40) lay down with care (4]) madrugar (42) get up early 4 Some Typical Problems In this section sonle of the problems mentioned in the introduction will he briefly discussed.","4.1 Argument Variables Embedded in a Complex Bas:[c Expression In sentence (43) there are two arguments \"Pete\" arid \"Mary\" and the idiom \"x. break x_'s heart\". The subject (\"Pete\")","[ z is treated in the same way as in the previous examples. The argument substitution 1\"ele substitutes the variable by the NP \"Pete\", giving the structure in (44), in which, eventtmlly, the NP \"Mary\" substitutes for the argument variable x I. Special M-Rules will have to be added to an M-granmar to achieve this kind of substitution. \"Normal\" argument 323 substitution rules substitute for the variables in their canonical positions, i.e. as a subject or (indirect) object directly under the clause node or as an object to a preposition in a prepositional object.

Structural transfer is not necessary, since idioms are mapped onto basic meanings. The grammar can operate on idiom structures in the same way as it operates on non-idiomatic structures , whil@, in the case of certain idioms, restrictions on operations are specified.
