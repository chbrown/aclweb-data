In Mizutani's theory, this event type is represented as a vector, but we represent it in the form of a binary relation.

On the other hand university students will have a poor stock of honorific words for there is no need to express honorific status, except to teachers.","A constraint is required which determines the relation between the honorific event type (Eh) and word representation. This is the \"conditional constraint on word selection (Cw).\" Mizutani's rules for first order through third order honorific relations given in 2.3. correspond to this constraint Cw. Word representation should be an event type called \"honorific word selection event (HW)\", and if a person does not have this event type in his resource situation, he or she will have a poor range of honorifics.

Second Part on The Relation between Context Features and the Sentence 3.2.1. C1L as basic language","Before going into the representation of lexical rules which give the correspondence between honorific word expressious and sentences, and context switching on honorific sentences, we describe CIL used in the description of lexical rules.

If this condition is not satisfied the unification \"term(X)\" in (2) will fail. Formula (2) utilizes the complex indeterminate and unifies \"abc\" to each slot value. 3.2.2. DCG Rules for honorlfies (I) First order bonorifics As Rule 1 in Section 2.3. shows, first order honorifics affect \"ps.\" This is illustrated by the following examples.

A sentence in discourse can be represented by the expression \"I)S,CS,I[alptm]]S,E\", but then how do we nmp contexts like DS and CS to complex sentences ? Mizutani's theory of honorific forms does not go into context switching in a complex sentence. So we have expanded his grammar and propose a basic mechanism for contcx~ switching.","Consider sentence l) below uttered by individual S to R which means \"individual T said that individual U said that Taro met llanako.\" In this example, we establish relations a) through j) among S, T, U, Taro and ltanako.

Conclusion It is easy to model honorific context in situation semantics. But we don't know how this context is represented in the human mind. This requires further research.","This treatment of the context switching mechanisms of honorifics is a first step toward analyzing more complicated phenomena. The main contribution ~)f this model derives from the fact that in any complex sentence, there will probably be context switching on honorifics..But this model shows context switching in a complex sentence only and tttere remains more complicated phenomena like the following.","S tlanako soma ni aLta' [ttanako sama] is a honorific fm'm","(1 met Ilanake.)","R \"llanako samattc dare?' (Who is \"Ilanako\"?)"]},{"title":"I--- $1 -I","paragraphs":["S 'Tanaka Ilanako' (tlanako Tanaka)","R 'Aa, hona no yatsu ka' [hana] is nonhonorific form","(Oh, liana!)","$1 is the direct speech act and ttmre should be a context switch because when R knows who llanako is, he refers to her with the nonhonorific \"liana.\" But we do not formalize the context switch which decides who is the agent of sentence $1. To solve this problem, we should use an \"anaphora mechanism for the honorific context\" and in order to build a firm model of this mechanism, study not only of the anaphora mechanism I Barwise 1985c1 but also the focusing mechanism [Sidner] is required. These also are topic for filrtbcr research.
