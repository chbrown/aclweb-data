Germany APE is a workbench to develop ATN grammars based on an active chart parser. It represents the networks graphically and supports the grammar writer by win- (tow- and menu-based debugging techniques. 1. ATNs - Attractive, but .... Augmented Transition Network Grammars are one of the frameworks for developing natural language parsers that has been used sueessfully in a large number of natural language systems for many languages since its introduction in the early seventies by Woods [WOO 701. Three aspects of ATNs, namely applicability in various types of natural language systems, suitability for different languages and the availability of efficient processing methods make ATNs an adequate framework for practically oriented development of natural language parsers. Since the time of its introduction the core of the ATN formalism has proved to be astonishingly stable and the exposition and specification of ATNs given in [BAT 78] turned out to become a quasi-standard. One of the five claims stated there, namely perspicuity, deserves some comments, because to us it doesn't seem justified strongly. On the contrary we feel that concerning perspicuity and descriptiveness ATN grammars do have some shortcomings. These come into play if you use the ATN formalism to develop a grammar for a nontrivial subset of a natural language. The main reason for this insufficient perspicuity clearly lies in the possiblities ATNs offer with respect to local and global register setting and testing. These facilities, though practically very useful, give an ATN grammar a somewhat procedural character, the grammar writer has to cope with. In this sense ATNs can be seen as a programming language for writing nondeterministic programs (grammars). Thus for the development of any larger grammars (programs) some sort of programming environment for ATNs not only is necessary but also compensates the lack of perspicuity and it makes the development of ATN grammars a practicable task. 2. Design Considerations for an ATN Environment Examining various ATN environments as [KEH 80], [GNE 82] and [CHR 831 for example we developed our ATN programming environment (APE) along following design principles. 1) The various tools the environment offers must be in-tegrated allowing simultaneous grammar editing and testing.","2) The grarmnar editor has to represent the network structures graphically allowing the user to access the grammar via the contextfree skeleton of the various networks.","3) The desigu of the system should make use of techniques like multi-windowing, menue- and mouse-based interaction facilities, in order to make the system usable in an easy manner. With this desiderata concerning the design of such a system, certain requirements concerning the hardware and software fi)r such an implementation are necessary. We have chosen Interlisp-D (Trademark of XEROX) as basis of APE, which due to its comprehensive display-and interaction facilitie:i~ proved to be an adequate starting point for the realisa-tion of our ideas.","3. Active Chart Parsing as a Framework for an ATN Environment Active Chart parsing ([KAP 73]) is a highly general framework to implement parsers. The two main ideas of this approach are to represent the parser's control structure explicitly allowing high flexibility in scheduling the various paths to be followed and to prevent the parser from doing the same thing twice using a comprehensive bookkeeping mechanism. The interaction of these components is shown schematically in figure 1. PARSER Figure 1 The possibilities of a flexible scheduling is achieved by means of an agenda, which at any state of the parser contains all the tasks that are induced by the grammar and not processed so far. The ordering of the agenda thereby determines the way, the search space is traversed. With this agenda-based scheduling facility the parser can apply various control structures like depth-first, breadth-first or heuristic scheduling, even changing it during one parse. Such facilities are of interest for \"tuning\" the parser's behaviour in an intended way. Agenda-based task scheduling also offers the operational facilities for pruning parts of the search space which amounts to switching off certain parts of a grammar during a parse. The second central concept in active chart parsing, the chart, is a graph structure, which does not only do the bookkeeping of the parsed constituents (the inactive edges). It also records each of the partial intermediate steps (the active edges), thus logically representing all the paths in work and all constituents parsed so far offering the possibility to inspect the uptothen parsing process. But more important, e.g. for perspicuity, the chart (i.e. its graphical representation) also can be seen as a des-criptive representation of the parser's state from a naive 399 grammar writers' point of view. It is a conceptually simple representation, whose atomic constructs, the graph's nodes, the active and inactive edges, have clear counterparts to the conceptual entities a grammar writer has a naive understanding of, namely the positions in the sentence to parse (i.e. the nodes), the partial parses spawning between two nodes (i.e. the active edges) and already analysed constituents (i.e. the inactive edges spawning the sequence of words between two nodes). Thus a graphical representation of the chart growing as the parser proceeds makes the parsing process easily perspicuable for the user. 4. Description of the Environment 4.1. The Grammar-Editor The user interface to the ATN grammar is built on top of an active graph-like representation of the single networks, which is initiated by the user in a menu-based manner. This bird's eye view gives the user an overall first impression of the global structure of the whole grammar with the type of the ,arc (PUSH, POP, CAT, JUMP) and the specification of categorial\" information with CAT- and PUSH-arcs. Thus the user is not beaten with an unnatural, artificially linearized (for example lispish) way to represent the basic graph-like concepts of ATNs. The benefits of such network-based grammar specification facilities have been pointed out by Grimes [GR175]. The networks, displayed in the way described above, additionally offers the user a number of operational facilities, such as getting:more specific information on a certain arc as for example its actions or additional tests. The user can activate the displayed network's arc and nodes respectively by clicking the mouse. Activating an arc hereby pops a menu with the following possibilities:","-","info: Gives a detailed printout of the arc, including its status (broken vs. unbroken).","- delete: Deletes the arc from the network, causing a new graphical layout of the network.","-","edit: Edits the complete arc in a mouse- and menu-oriented editor with all necessary facilities to modify various parts of the arc, such as tests, actions and forms as well as its weight. Leaving the editor several checks are performed, putting the user back into the edit mode, if the modified arc structure is incorrect (e.g. if it contains too many items or items of an incorrect type at the wrong place).","- break: Puts a break on the arc taking the user into the break mode with interactive facilities (as described below) after the broken arc's actions are performed.","- unbreak: Removes a break from the arc. Activating a node in the network offers the following facilities: - info: - insert: Gives a detailed printout of all the arcs starting at that node. Allows the user to insert an arc starting at the node activated, the arc's ending node (except POP-arcs) being determined via the mouse. To introduce additional new nodes the user is prompted by the system for subsequent arcs until he specifies a POP-arc or an already existing node as ending node of the last prompted arc. 400","- merge: A new node N1 is inserted after node N with the leaving arcs of N now beginning at N1 and a new arc between N and N1. 4.2. Grammar-Debugger The user can specify in advance certain constructions he wants to be parsed, thus having the possiblitiy to test certain NP-constructions for example without the over-head of parsing a whole sentence. These debugging facilities can be involved in three ways: primarily while the parser is working in a stepper-mode oy means of a user interaction, secondly during the parser's run by means of a break put on an grammar arc and thirdly system-initiated at the end of the parse giving the user the possibility to restart. In the stepper-mode the user can cause a break while watching the chart growing as the parser processes one task after another in the following way. During the single steps of creating of the chart graphically the system is interruptable to give the user the opportunity to put APE's stepper into the break-mode ~oy mouseclicking the relevant menu's item). In the break-mode the user is offered a number of operational facilities which can be accessed activating the chart nodes and edges with the mouse. When selecting an edge the user can get more detailled info~anation as for example its weight, its register environment and its history, consisting of the path through the grammar each arc being augmented with additional information as its current inputword, its register environment and the number of the task being responsible for processing that arc, which directly reflects the way the scheduling is performed. But more importantly the ~.ammar tester can also modify the edges in various dimensions, including the following options: - registers: - weight: - ending edge: The user can change registers by employing the same language he is used to as a grammar writer, i.e. in terms of actions defined in the ATN formalism as for example SETRs, ADDRs or form to be evaluated such as BUILDQs. Allows to change of the weight of an edge, affecting the order of further processing. With this option an edge can be modified with respect to the part of the input being spanned by it. This last option together with the possibilities of register modifying renders for example the simple simulation of the parser's behaviour under the assumption of a (effectively missing or due to not matching tests blocked) grammar arc by enlarging the span of an edge. Another more powerful possibility in testing a grammar is the introduction of additional (in)active edges, connecting two arbitrary nodes, which can be achieved via an activation of the starting arc. This allows the specification of partial parses or parsed constituents, which - though missing due to some defect in the grammar - the user wants the to make use of in further parsing process. Parallel to all the options presented so far the user can edit the grammar on the fly, thus being able to modify the grammar just when he recognises certain bugs. Additionally APE gives the user the possibilitiy to manipulate the agenda offering him various actions to be performed on the single tasks l!ke freezing and killing a task, or changing its weight, this facility provides an advanced grammar writer with very effective means to focus the parser on things that are interesting for him in a certain situation, abondoning with irrelevcnt paths or postponing them. Finally, when the user has done all the things that seemed useful to him at this break point he can continue the parsing process leaving the stepper options as they are or changing them appropriately. At the end of the parsing process the user again gets in a break mode giving him the opportunuity of inserting new edges with the facility to restart the parsing process with this new information. Thus adding a new inactive edge and restarting for example amounts to asking the parser \"what would yours results have been with an additional constituent ci from word wj to word Wk?\". With the facilities described above the user also can easily analyse a configuration when the parser did not succeed in parsing a certain construction• This description, though sketchy, should give an impression of the ~acilitities of APE and the ideas behind it. An illustration of APE's environment is shown in the appendix. 5. Outlook The described ATN programming environment gives substantial support to the user in building up a working grammar, but some of APE's aspects aren't completely sattsfymg. ~o a lot of polishing the user interface as well as improving the functionality is still to be done."]},{"title":"Appendix","paragraphs":["Snapshot of the system in the breakmode.

SYNTAX OF.

The first has no impact at all oil the semantics of the transductton (displaying a message on an auxiliary file); the two others, on the contrary, are significant for the transduction (displaying a return code on the error file and stopping the transductlon; moving the \"forward\" head back to the position of the \"current\" head (seml-regularlty)).","A rule describes a (;lass of transitions of the shape : input string / condition == output string / actions . the symbol ? at the head of the rule signifies that the inpqt string is to be read under the \"forward 't head.","The philosophy of LT |s to put together the possible passages from one etlquetto to another into a bundle of tile shape:","de <etlquettel> a <etiquette2> via rlllel rule2 . . . ruleN 4.
