Instead, orthographic rules are interpreted directly, as constraints on pairings of surface strings with lexieal strings. Tile rule notation employed, including conventions for express-ing abbreviations, is based on that described in Koskenniemi [1983,1984]. Tile rules actually used in this system are based on tile account of English in Karttunen and Wittenburg [1983]. 2.1 Rules What follows is an inductive introduction to the types of rules needed. Some pertinent data will be presented, then some potential rules for handling these data. We shall also discuss the reasons for needing a weaker form of rule and indicate what it might look like.","Let us first consider some data regarding English /s/ morphemes: ALWAYS -ES box+s ~--~ boxes class+s ~ classes fizz+s ~ fizzes spy+s *----* spies ash+s ~ ashes ehureh+s ~---o churches ALWAYS -S slam+s ~ slams hit+s ~ hits tip+s *---* tips SOMETIMES -ES, SOMETIMES -S piano+s ~ pianos solo+s ~ solos do+s ~ does potato+s ~ potatoes banjo+s ~ banjoes or banjos cargo+s ~ cargoes or cargos","Below are presented two possible orthographic rules for describing the foregoing data: tu) + ---, c {x I z I y/i I s (h) I c h} _ s p~2) + ---* e {x I z I y/i I s (h) I e h I o} _ s The first of these rules will be shown to be too weak; the second, in contrast, will be shown to be too strong. This fact will serve as an argument for introducing a second kind of rule. 272 Before describing how the rules should be read, it is necessary to define two technical terms. In phonology, one speaks of underlying segments and surface segments; in orthography, characters making up the words in the lexicon contrast with characters in word forms that occur in texts. The term"]},{"title":"lezical character","paragraphs":["will be used here to refer to a character in a word or morpheme in tile lexicon, i.e., the analog of a phonological underlying segment.

For example, [1 o v e + e d] is a string of lexieal characters, while [I o v e d] is a string of surface characters. We may now describe how the rules should be read. The first rule should be read roughly as, \"a morpheme boundary [+] at the lexical level corresponds to an [el at the surface level whenever it is between an [x] and an [s], or between a [z] and an [s], or between a lcxical [y] corresponding to a surface [i] and an [s], or between an [ s h] and an [s] or between a[e h] and an [s].\" This means, for instance, that the string of lexical characters [c h u r e h + s] corresponds to the string of surface characters [c h u r c h e s] (forgetting for the moment about the possibility that other rules might also obtain). The second rule is identical to the first except for an added [o] in tile left context. When we say [+] corresponds to [el between an lxl and an N, we mean between a Icxical I x] corresponding to a surface lxl and a lexical Is] corrcsponding to a surface [s]. If we wantcd to say that it does not matter what the lexieal [x] corresponds to on the surface, we would use [x/=] instead of"]},{"title":"just","paragraphs":["ix]. The rules given above get tile facts right for the words that do not end in [o]. For those that do, however, Rule 1 misses on [do+s] ~-~ [docs], [potato+s[ ¢=~ [potatoes]; Rule 2 misses on [piano+s] ~ [pianos], [solo+s] ~:~ [solos[. Furthermore, neither rule allows for the possibility of more than one acceptable form, as in [banjo+s] ~ ([banjoes] or [banjos]), [cargo+s] ([cargoes] or [cargos]). The words ending in [o] can be divided into two classes: those that take an [es] in their plural and third-person singular forms, and those that just take an [s]. Most of the facts could be described correctly by adopting one of the two rules, e.g., the one stating that words ending in [o] take an [es] ending. In addition to adopting this rule, one wouhl need to list all the words taking an [s] crating as being irregular. This approach has two problems. First, no matter which rule is chosen, a very large number of words wouht have to bc listed in the lexicon; second, this approach does not account for the cocxlstcnce of two alternative forms for some words, e.g., [banjoes] or [banjos]. The data and arguments just given suggest the need for a second type of rule. It would stipulate that such and such a correspondence is"]},{"title":"allowed","paragraphs":["but"]},{"title":"not required.","paragraphs":["An example of such a rule is given below: R3) +/c allowed in context o _ s. Rule 3 says that a morpheme boundary may correspond to an [el between an [o] and an [s]. It also has the effect of saying that if a morphcme boundary ever corresponds to an [c], it must be in a context that is explicitly allowed by some rule. If we now have the two rules R1 and R3, R1) 4- ~e/ {xlz [y/[Is(h) [eh} -s R3) +]e allowed in context o _ s, we can generate all the correct forms for the data given. Further-more, for the words that have two acceptable forms for plural or third person sing-ular, we get both, just as we would like. The problem is that we generate both forms whether we want them or not. Clearly some sort of restriction on the rules, or \"fine tuning,\" is in order; for the time being, however, the problem of deriving both forms is not so serious that it cannot be tolerated. So far we have two kinds of rules, those stating that a correspondence always obtains in a certain environment, and those stating that a correspondence is allowed to obtain in some environment. The data below argue for one more type of rule, namely, a rule stipulating that a certain correspondence never obtains in a certain environment. DATA FOR CONSONANT DOUBLING DOUBLING: bar+ed ~ barred big+est ~ biggest refer+ed +---~ referred NO DOUBLING: question+ing ,---4 questioning hear+ing ~ hearing hack+ing ~ hacking BOTH POSSIBILITIES: travel+ed ~ (travelled or traveled) both are allowed In English, final consonants are doubled if they, \"follow a single [orthographic] vowel and the vowel is stressed.\" [from l{arttunen and Wittenbnrg 1983]. So for instance, in [hear+ing], thc final [r I is preceded by two vowels, so there is no doubling. In [haek+ing], the final [k] is not preceded by a vowel, so there is no doubling. In [question+lug], the last syllable is not stressed so again there is no doubling. In Karttunen and Wittenlmrg [1983] there is a single rule listed to describe the data. llowever, the rule makes use of a diacritic (') for showing stress, and words in the lexicon must contain this diacritic in order for the rule to work. The same thing could be done in the system being described here, but it was deemed undesirable to allow words in the lexicon to contain diacritics encoding information such as stress. Instead, the following rules are used. Ultimately, the goal is to have some sort of general mechanism, perhaps negative rule features, for dealing with this sort of thing, but for now no such mechanism has been implemented.

The disallowed-type rules in the second set constrain the doubling so it does not occur in words like [eat+ing] ¢:==> [eating] and [hear+ing] ¢====~ [hearing I. The disallowed-type rulcs say that a morpheme boundary [+] may not ever correspond to a consonant when tile [+] is followed by a vowel and preceded by that same consonant and then two more vowels. The rules given above suffer from the same problem as the previous rules, namely, over generation. Although they produce all the right answers and allow nmltiple forms for words like [travel+er] ~ ([traveller] or [traveler]), which is certainly a positive result, they also allow multiple forms for words which do not allow them. For instance they generate both [referred] and [refered]. As mentioned earlier, this problem will be tolerated for the time being. 2.2 Comparison with Koskenniemi's Rules Koskenniemi [1983, 1984] describes three types of rules, as exemplified below: R4) a > b :=:*- c/d c/f- g/h i/j"]},{"title":"RS) a > b ~= old e/f- g/h i/j R6) a","paragraphs":[">"]},{"title":"b ~ e/d ell- g/h i/j.","paragraphs":["Rule R4 says that if a lexical [a] eorresponds to a surface [b], then it must be within tile context given, i.e., it must be preceded by [c/d eft] and followed by [g/h i/j|. This corresponds exactly to tile rule given below: RV) a/b allowed in context old e/f_ g/h i/j. The rule introduced as R5 and repeated below says that if a lexieal [a] occurs following [c/d e/f| and preceding [g/h i/j|, then it must correspond to a surface [b]: RS) a > b e-= e/d e/f_ g/h i/j. 'rhe corresponding rule in the formalism being proposed here would look approximately like this: R10) a/sS disallowed in context e/d c/f- g/h i/j, where sS is some set of characters to which","[a] can correspond that does not include [b]. A comparison of each system's third type of rule involves compost|on of rules and is the subject of the next section. 2.3 Rule Composition and Decomposition In Koskennlemi's systems, rule composition is fairly straightforward.

In contrast, the composition of rules in the system proposed here is slightly more complicated. We need the notion of a default correspondence. The default correspondence for any alphabetic character is itself. In other words, in the absence of any rules, an alphabetic character will correspond to itself. There may also be characters that are not alphabetic, e.g., the [+] representing a morpheme boundary, currently the only non-alphabetic character in this system. Other conceivable non-alphabetic characters would be an accent mark for representing stress, or say, a hash mark for word boundarics. The default for these characters is that they correspond to 0 (zero). Zero is ttle name for the null character used ill this system.","Now it is easy to say how rules are composed in this system.

It also affirms that lexical [q-] may appear between as Ix| and a~t Is|. Other rules starting with tbe same pair say, in effect, \"here is another cnvirmuncnt where this pair is acceptable.\" The way these rules are to be interpreted is that a rule's main correspondence, i.e., the character pair that corresponds to the underscore in tile context, is forbidden except in contexts where it is expressly permitted by some rnle. Once the rules are broken into the more primitive allowed-type and disallowed-type rules, there are several ways in which one could try to match them against a string of surface characters in tile recognition process. One way wonld be to wait until a pair of characters was encountered that was the main pair for a rule, and tficn look backwards to see if the left context of the rule matches the current analysis path. If it does, put the right context on hold to see whether it will ultimately be matched. Another posslblility would be to continually keel) track of the left contexts of rnles that are matching the characters at hand, so that when tbe main character of a rule is encountered, the program already knows that the left context has been matched. The right context still needs to be pnt on hold and dealt with the same way as in the other scheme. The second of the two strategies is the one actually employed in this system, though it may very well turn out that the first one is more efficient for the current grammar of English. 2.5 Possible Correspondences The rules act as filters to weed out seqnenees of character pairs, but before a particular mapping can bc weeded out, somcthlng needs to propose it ~s being possible. There is a list called a list of l)ossible correspondences, or sometimes, a list of feasible pairs - that tells which characters may correspond to which others. Using this list, the ri:cognizer generates l)ossible Icxica] forms to correspond to tile input surface form. These can then bc checked against the rules and against the lexicon. If tim rules (1o not weed it out, and it is also in the lexicon, we have successfully recognized a morpheme. 3"]},{"title":"Syntax","paragraphs":["The goal of the work being deserlbcd was an analyzer that would be easy to use. In the area of syntax, this entails two subgoal.s. First, it should be easy to specify which morphemes may combine with which, and second, when tile recognition tlas been completed, the result shnuld be something that can easily be used by a parser or some other program. Karttunen [1983] and Karttlmen and Wittenburg [1983] have some suggestions for what a proper syntactic component for a morphological analyzer might contain. They mention using context-free rules and some sort of feature-handling system as possible extensions of both their and Koskenniemi's systems. In short, it has been acknowledged that any such system really ought to have some of the tools that have been used in syntax proper. The first course of action that was followed in building this analyzer was to implement a unification system for (lags (directed acyclie graphs), and then to have the analyzer unify the dags of all tile morphemes encountered in a single analysis. That scheme turned out to be too weak to be practical. The next step was to implement a PATR rule interpreter [Shieber, et al. 1983] so that selected paths of dags could bc unified. Finally, when that turned out to be still less flexible than one would like, tile capability of handling disjunction in the dags was added to the unification package, and the PATR rule interpreter [Karttnncn i984]. The rules look like PA'I'R rules with tile context free skeleton. The first two lines of a rule are just a comment, however, and are not used in doing the analysis. The recognizer starts with the (lag [cat: empty]. The rnle below states that the \"empty\" dag may be combined with the (lag from a verb stem to produce a dag for a verb. % verb ~ emllty + verb stem % 1 2 3 <2 cat> = empty <3 cat> = verb_stem <3 type> = regular <1 type> = <3 type> <l cat> = verb <1 word> = <3 lex> <l form> = {inf","tense: pres"]},{"title":"pers: {1 ~} 1}.","paragraphs":["The resulting dag will he a.mbigatous between an infinitive verh, and a l)rcsent tense verb that is in clther the first or second person.

If an ling| is encountered after a verb has been found, the following rule builds the new (lag.

The system also has a rule for combining an infinitive verb with the nominalizing [er] morpheme, e.g., swim : swimmer. This rule, given below, also checks the form of the input verb to verify that it is infinitive, it makes the resnlting dag have category: noun, number: singular, and so on. % noun --~ verb + er % 1 2 3 <2 cat> = verb <3 lex> -- er <2 form> = inf <1 cat> --- noun <1 word> = <2 word> <1 nbr> = sg <1 pers> = :3 . The noun thus formed behaves just the same as other nouns. In particular, a pluralizing Is] may be added, or a possessive ['s], or any other affix that can be appended to a noun. There are other rules in the grammar for handling adjective endings, more verb endings, etc. Irregular forms are handled in a fairly reasonable way. The irregular nouns are listed in the lexicon with form: irregular. Other rules than the ones shown here refer to that feature; they prevent tile addition of plural morphemes to words that are already plural. Irregular verbs are listed in the lexicon with an appropriate value for tense (not unifiable with inf) so that the test for infinitivcness will fail when it should. Irregular adjectives, e.g. good, better, best are dealt with in an analogous manner."]},{"title":"4","paragraphs":["Further Work There are still some things that are not as straightforward as one would like. In particular, consider the following example. Let us suppose as a first approximation that one wanted to analyze the [un] prefix in English as combining with adjectives to yield new ones, e.g., unfair, unclear, unsafe. Suppose also that one wanted to be able to build past participles of transitive verbs (passives) into adjectives, so that they could combine with [tin], a.~ in uncovered, unbuilt, unseen. What we would need, would be a rule to combine an \"empty\" with an [un] to make an [un] and then a rule to combine an [un] with a verb stem to form a thingl, and finally a rule to combine a thingl with a past participle marker to form a negative adjective. More rules would be needed for the case where [un] combines with an adjective stem like [fair]. In addition, rules would be needed for irregular passives, etc. In short, without a more sophisticated control strategy, the grammar would contain a fair amount of redundancy if one really attempted to handle English morphology in its entirety. However, on a more positive note, the rules do allow one to deal effectively and elegantly with a sufficient range of phenomena to make it quite acceptable as, for instance, an interface between a parser and its lexicon."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["A morphological analyzer has been presented that is capable of interpreting both orthographic and syntactic rules.
