INTRODUCTION The experience we have gained in designing [3,6,7] and using natural lanauage interfaces has led us to develop a general natural language system, INTERFAC[LE, involving the following principles : the linguistic coverage must be elementary but must include phenomena that allow a rapid, concise and spontaneous interaction, such as anapho~a (ellipsis, pronouns, etc.) the linguistic competence and limits of the interface must be easily and rapidly perceived by the user. the interface must be equipped with strategies and procedures for leading the user to adjust his linguistic competence to the capacities of the system. We have illustrated these principles in an application : a natural language (French) interface for acquiring the formal commands of some operating system languages. (The examples given here concern DCL of Digital Equipment Corporation). 2. INTERFACILE's ARCHITECTURE The system is composed of :","- a portable syntactic grammar of French written in the formalism of Metamorphosis Grammars [2]. - a domain dependent lexicon-grammar [4].","- a domain dependent knowledge base written in a subset of predicate logic (Horn Clauses). Operating on these linguistic data and domain knowledge :","- a syntactic parser coupled with the grammar and the lexicon-grammar (i) produces intermediate analyses of questions, and (2) generates some messages in case of errors.","- a semantlc parser transforms the syntactic analysis into a semantic representation by consulting the knowledge base.","- an evaluator consults the knowledge base and produces answers to questions given their semantic representation.","- a general system guides the user and helps him to formulate and reformulate his queries. The system is entlrely programmed in PROLOG II and runs on various computers (VAX, SPS and micro-computers). Responses are given instantaneously. Eere is an example of a dialogue with INTERFACILE : > comment crder un flchler ? -","utillsez la commande : CREATE nomflchler > comment l'imprimer ? - utilisez la commande : PRINT nom£ichier > comment modifier son contenu ? - utilisez l'ddlteur avec la","commande : EDIT nomfichler","> comment copier un fichier dane un rdpertolre ?","utlllsez la commande : COPY nomflchier [nomrdpertoire]","> comment renommer ce dernier ? -","utilisez la commands : RENAME/DIRECTORY [ancienrdpertoire]","[nouveaurdpertoire] <Dialogue I> (The prompt \">\" precedes the user's queries, the prompt ..... precedes INTERFACILE's answers. English translations of the dialogues are given in the appendix). 46 3. LINGUISTIC COVERAGE INTERFACILE handles only elementary s~ntactlc structures° In order to ensure a concise and spontaneous dialogue, proforsLs have been introduced such as : '° pronouns (le, la, les, en, y, lui,"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["eur ...."]},{"title":")","paragraphs":["-possessives (son, sa, ses .... ) demonstratlves (celui-ci, ceux-ci, ce dernier~ . . .) If an ambiguity is detected during the resolui:ion of a profovm, INTERFACILF, asks a question~ as in the fo].]owing dialogue :","> comment copier un flchier dans un rSpe~tol~'e ?","\"- utllisez la commands : COPY nomfichier [nomrQper'toire] > comment l'effacer ? • \" '~ 1 ' ~' renvoi e ~ : fichier ? (i Pgpertoire ? (2","tapez le num4ro de vo'tre choix. <Dialogue 2> Proform r~soltttlon is based solely on lexical a~d syntactic information. This strategy Is vital in the framework of a didact.ic system oriented towards beginners as the following dialogue shows :","> comment envoyer un message A un utilisateur ? utilisez la commands : HAIL > comment le supprimer ?","\"le\" renvoie & :","message ?","utilisateur ?","%apez le num4ro de votre choix.

QUERY REFORHULATION Given the plethora of syntactic structures and the complexity of mental processes involved in natural language understanding, the linguistic competence of in%effaces yet remains limited. If we resort to such systems to request ~ service or obtain information that we lack, we generally know much more than the interface itself on the various ways for fo~mulatlng our query. Ue argue that the quality of a natural language interface must be estimated not only in terms of its linguistic coverage but also in terms of the procedures for dealing with incorrect, extragrammatical (i.e. correct but not expected b~ the interface) or semantically deviant sentences. Knowing that error recovery is a complex task in the \"restricted\" framework of programming languages (limited syntax and rJ. gorously defined semantics), one can appreciate -the difficulty of endowing natural language interfaces with such capabilities. One approach to \"the problem of error recoverJng is to \"accept\" user queries that deviate from the system's expectations and (unbeknown to the user) manipulate them into a form that can be analysed. FoP an overview of this approach, see [1]. This method is costly to implement, and moreover }%as 'two theoretical faults :","(I) There is no guarantee that the system's interpretation of a \"deviant\" query will correspond to the user's intention in posing the question.","(2) There will always be a limit to the degree of deviation the system can tolerate before it gives up trying to analyse a user query. But if the transformation of deviant queries into recognizable structures is performed automatically, the user will *lever know where this limit lles, and may believe that the system can make sense of anything he enters. The distinction between the sentences the system interprets correctly i~nd those which it entirely rejects will seem arbitrary to him. The strategy developped and implemented in INTERFACILE is quite different. Our philosophy is not to mislead the user concerning the system's real capabilities, but rather to lead his linguistic competence to that of the interface. Here is an example illustrating such a strategy :","> comment ajouter A un fichier is contenu d'un flchier ?","- pour \"ajouter\", utilisez la construction :"]},{"title":"47","paragraphs":["ajouter [quelque chose] & [quelque chose] compl4tez (ou tapez / pour annulet) > comment ajouter ... <Dialogue 4> Here is another example :","> comment envoyer un message dans un terminal ?","- pour \"envoyer\", utilisez les constructions :","envoyer [quelque chose] & [quelqu'un]","envoyer [quelque chose] sur [quelque chose] compl4tez (ou tapez / pour annulet) > comment envoyer ... <Dialogue 5> INTERFACILE explains exactly which part of the question it doesn't understand : an unknown word, a verb with an incorrect preposition or unexpected order of complements, etc. In case o£ spelling errors, solutions for correction are given to the user [8]. To guide the user in reformulating his query, the grammar and the lexicon-grammar are consulte~ as knowledge bases. The user may reformulate his query with the information given by INTERFACILE. (At any moment, the user can also obtain the lists of verbs, nouns, prepositions, pronouns, etc.). When the user has an erroneous or incomplete view of the application domain, INTERFACILE points out his misunderstanding, as in the following dialogue :","> comment imprimer le fichler d'une version ? flchler de quoi ? INTERFACILE parle plutft de : fichier (tout simplement) fichier d'un r~pertolre version d'un fichier <Dialogue 6> Another example : > comment initialiser un fichier ? INTERFACILE n'en salt rien, mais salt comment :"]},{"title":"48","paragraphs":["cr4er un fichier ~dlter un fichler effacer un fichler initlallssr un disque initialiser une dlsquette <Dialogue 7> The guidance given here goes beyond linguistic reformulation. It concerns the semantics of the application domain. Note that the information given to the user is not preprogrammed, but is (I) deduced from the knowledge base and (2) generated by the linguistic component (grammar, lexicon-grammar and parsers). 5. CONCLUSION As far as the domain of application is concerned, INTERFACILE has much in common with systems like UC [9] or INTERIX [5]. The originality of our system lies in the effort we have devoted to :","- linguistic phenomena such as anaphora that ensure a natural dialogue. strategies and procedures for reformulation in order to live with the unavoidable linguistic limitations of any interface. Our research and experience in developing applications in these two domains have led us to believe that it is not practical to add procedures to an albeady existing system to make it user-£rlendly. On the contrary, these problems must be taken into account in the design phase, as we have done in designing INTERFACILE. 6.
