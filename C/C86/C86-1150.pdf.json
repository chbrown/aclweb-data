Members of this project group now include t~o computer scientists, one linguist, and five lexicographer / edit~ / te~minologlst.

The CAT concepts beldnd this system is well-known and weE-documented [Boltet and Vauquols 1985].","This softwaPe has been prog~ammd using different levels of computer Isngnmges, from IBM assembly (PL360) to PL/I, and making extensive use of system tools of the IBM VM/CM~ ~stem - XEDIT and EX~. (~e of its advantages is efficiency (as cemDared to other similm, aystems), which means that it can execute with reasonable speed even on a combatively sa~ll computem system.

Althou$~ theme lind been s~me criticisms about ARIANE in the literature, our experience has sho~ that insplte of its recognised weaknesses and drawbacks, it remains an extr~ly powemgul and practical set of tools f~r the development of CAT systess. Of course, the methodology pioneered at GETA [Vanquois 75] has been incorF~mated into ninny 'new' systems today.","On the physical side, the ARIAN~ system itself occnpies about 8 Mbyte of secondary storage, while the usem n~cldne requiwes m]othem 5 Mbyte for storing the linguistic data (grammar models and dictionaries, but not including the source and target texts and their intermediate :~esults).

The Qualitz of Translation"]},{"title":"Gradin~ Scheme","paragraphs":["In orde~ to assess the 'quality' of the translation output, a grading scheme (from grade A to grade F) was devised using a sentence as the benndary of assessment. This scheme is based on the ease of posfi-edit~ig the translation output, and not on the quality ur standard of trsaslation in the inure usual sense.","Currently, there is no estahlished method of evaluating ccrnputer-alded-trasslatlon or mechanical translation output. Fase of post-editlng is a measure which also takes into account the ease of understsnding as we]/ as the accuracy of translation. Two impurtant fact,s which affect say grading scheme is the typology of the source text itself asd the expert knowledge of the evaluatur in that particular area of text. Some method of evaluating the ease of undurstandlng of the source text and scme definition of a neutral evaluator are ~urequlsiten to shy stasdardlsed evaluation scheme.","%~le grading scheme proposed in this report is a measure of the time required to edit sentences translated by the cc~¢outer, ranging 9tom fast (as in grade A where no pest-editing is reqtdred) to slow (as in grade F where a sentence has to be retranslated manually). There has been no attempt to catag~mise the source sentences into different degrees of difficulty ur length. Hence, the typology of text used in this evaluation must be burne in mind when assessing the overall results. Although grades are assigned to ~ndividual sentences, the source texts were extracted by paragraphs, and hence, the continuity of the text is maintained. The actual grading itself was carried out by more th2m one individual in urder to reduce (as much as possible) the effect of individual 'bias'. After careful scrutiny, it was concluded that variation in the results obtained is within expected limits, thus allowing broad conclusions to be drawn on the effectlveness/usefkflness of the translation ~stem. The grades assigned to translated sentences are as follows: A: ~ect translation, no modification required. B: list of alternative wurds selected by post-editur. C: understasdable translation (with preservation of","meaning), single word correct lens without reference to","source text. D: as in C, but referencs to source text is necessary.

Emlstlr~ Problems Classification","An attempt was made to analyse the problems encountered, i.e. the errurs in translation output. This involves a tedious process of correctly identItyiog the source of each ereor found in the trasslation output, and then classifying then according to the phase of translation (i.e. analysis, trassfur or generation) at which they occur. The purpose is to identify simple problems which can be solved in the existing system through modifications to the linguistic data, while more c~plex ~oblams can be the subject of further research. This analysis of errors &Iso provides statistical infsrmation on their distribution and importasce, hence giving some guidelines as to their priority for fur thur investigation.

The probl~n of ~m~iguity here refers to smbi~ties which remain unresolved at the end of analysis and to cases of erroneous dls~nblguation. This type of problem is by far the most important, accounting fur close to 50 percent of the e~isting errors found in the anslysis phase. Ambiguities which remain unresolved include vurb/noun ( ' foam1', 'wurks' ,'use' ), verb/adjective ( 'direct', 'total' ), verb/yen ( ' .. is unglazed paper..
