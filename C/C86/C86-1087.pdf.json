So we must turn our attention to (i) the internal structure of the phrases and (it) the order of phrases (and ale intonation, of course only in speech) that plays an ~mportant role in expressing communicative functions.","The basic idea of -the strategy we propose builds on the invariants of the sentence struchlre of free word order languages, that is, (i) the first thing to do is to recognize -the internal structure of the parts of speech and (ii) Wm second Js to interpret their relative order. [his order is connected with the communicative ,o.,.~- ~ (topic, focus etc.) of thc structurc.","The sang tactic analysis of free word order,sentences is based upon -the morphemes identified by morphological analysis. The lexicon cannot help us to give the actual functional role of a morpheme because of two reasons: (in All possible functional roles of a morpheme cannot be listed. (it) If there were severa] possible roles in the description of morphemes nobody would know which of them to use actually. 4. UNKNOWN ELEMENTS The problems of the unknown elements can arise not only in the ease of computational analysis, since people may read/hear morphemes never read/heard before, yet they can identify the actual syntactic role of them without any knowledge of any previous syntactical categorization. The~or word class of a word is statistical information about its occurrence in particular syntactic positions. For example, the word 'beteg' can be a noun ('patient') or an adjective ('sick','ill') in Hungarian. It is an adjective in adjectival use, that is without inflections or beZore adjectival suffixes:","'E16zSleg soha nem volt beteg.'","('He has never been ill before.')","'Hat napja fekszik betegen.'","('He has been laid up since six days.') The same morpheme can, however, be a noun before nominal suffixes:","'A betegnek hem volt infarktusa.'","('The patient has had no infarctions.') Although we consider categorization as a syntactic generalization, we do not claim that there are no in-dependent syntactical categories. In agglutinative languages such categories are e.g.-the nominal suffixes just mentioned. These categories are not arbitrary, because one cannot introduce a new sufZix to the language, but can, however, use new stems Jn the 366 sentence. If the parser knows these regularii;ies, then lexical categories will be used for control only. 5. SENTENCE SIRUCTURE IN AGGLUTINATIVE LANGUAGES Below we will make use of Hungarian examples to show -the most important properties of a typical agglutinative language. In a simple serltence there can be only one finite verbal suffix. If we have a sentence con-- raining -two of them, then we have to do with co-ordinate clauses or one sentence with a subordinate clause. Naturally, the finite suffix is J.mmed~ately preceded by a verbal stem. If the sentence has no finite verba] suffixes, (in it contains a O-copula that is rather frequent, not orlly in medical -texts but also in the every-day Hungarian or (ii) there :i.s ~Jsis in the sentence. The non-finite verbal suffixes are also pre-- ceded by a verbal stem. These elements can behave differently accord4ng to whether or not they influence the word order of other elements.","We consider t, he noun as an element that stands before a nominal suffix ~. Sometimes the Iexieon does not categorize theJs morpheme as a noun. We consider this situation as a case of a missin 0 noun. Regeneration of missir/g elements is important because of identifying elliptical constructions. For example~ Hungarian adjectives can have nominal endings when no noun occurs in the structure.","As it seems, most of the morphemes do net have a f~xed lexiea], cateoory ~ because their positions in the sentence actually define their functional role. But we have some important lexical features:","(i) Sterns . lhey are closed morphologically to the ].eft and open to the right (formal]y: <stem ). \"Open\" means an abi:lity to join other elements. In the case u i\" ,,uu, l-lLhe u,,uz~ Liluue \"OLIiL~L\" elUIilL~llLW aL'U1 .~uL\" example, Wqe case suf£ixes. (it) guZfixes, rhey are closed morphologically to the right and open to the left (suffix) ), e.g. the case endings. (iii) _Open endings. They are open morphologically on both sides ( open ), e.g. the morphemes markingplura]- ity or possessivity. (iv) Closed elemnts. They are closed on both s~des ((clo~, e.g. adjectives, numerals, adverbials. So, if a closed side immediately precedes an open one or an open one a closed one, the parser has to correct the \"wrong\" sequence inserting an empty morpheme:","(an (stem <closed> --~-<stem suffix><closed>","(b) < closed> suffix)--~-<c]osed> {stem suffix# Instance (an carl be, for example, a genitive case-insertion (as this case ending can sometimes have an empty form in Hungarian) and instance (b) can be a noun insertion between an adjectival stem and a nominal suffix.","6. PARTS OF SPEECH The surface scheme of a Hungarian sentence Js the following:","( <A~<S NT<V NF)')~<V F> ( ~A>'<S N~<V NE>*) ~ where A stands for adverbials, S for nominal and V for verbal stems, N for nominal case endings, F for finite and NE for non-finite verbal suffixes. Hence the t~ of the constituents are as follows:","(in independent' adverbials (without any suffix), (it) non-finite verbs (e.g. infinitive, gerund), (iii) nominal groups with case ending, (iv) a verb plus a finite suffix (the main verb of the sentence).","Having made clear the internal structure of the constituents, the parser can deal with the formal evaIuation of the connections between the constituents (e.g. verb and complements, possessives and possessors etc.). In the first part of the parsing we do not ]feed any S-symbols, more precisely, ally string over a particu].ar set, the~of~ can serve as S-symbol, l he ca:in parts of speech can be described with a llelp of the schemes (])-(iv), but in fact, only (iJ) and (iii) are imporLanL. AdverbJa].s of type (i)usually consist of one e].emellt and every sewLence has one and only one strucl:ure of type (Jr). Sentences rather frequently consist of more than two constJtuenLs, but in a free word order language there is no)~_yj]ical @ri~ ord_ ej'_ of Lhe,~;e constiLuui11:s. Our method is based Oll this observatJon. We do not describe the structural relations Jn the sentence sequentially from the J eft to I:he right end of the selrtencc, gut rules fo;:m blocks and these blocks are used Jn an order depending on tile elenlenLs of Uqe arLual sentence. 7.
