S. A. Abstract: We study the weak generative capacity of a class of parenthesis-free categorial grammars derived /torn those of Aries and Steedman by varying the set of reduction rules. With forward cancellation as the only rule, the grammars are weakly equivalent to context-free grammars. When a backward combination rule is added, it is no longer possible to ohlain all the context-free languages. With suitable restriction of the forward partial rule, the languages are still context-free and a push-down automaton can be used for recognition. Using the unrestricted rule of forward partial combination, a context-sensitive language is obtained. INTRODUCTION","The system of categorial grammars, developed ill lnodern times from the work of Ajdukiewicz (1935), has recently been the attention of renewed interest, hlspired by the use of categori-- al notions in Montague gramlnar~ more recent systems, sneh as GPSC, have developed related corlccpts and notations. This in turn leads to a resurgence of interest in pure catcgorial systems.","Classically, a categorial grammar is a quadruple G(VT, VA,J;,F), where VT is a finite set of morl)hemes , and VA is a tinite set of atomic categories, one of which is the distinguished category S. The set CA of categories is formed from VA as follows: (1) VAisasubset of CA, (2) if X and Y are in CA, t.hcJ, (X,\"Y)is I CA The grammar also (:md.ain,~ a lexicon F, which is a function from words to finite subsets of CA. A categorial grammar lacks rules; instead there is a can cellation ride mq)lieit ill the formalism: if X and Y are categories, then (X/Y) Y -' X.","The lauguage of a categorial grammar is the set of ter minal strings with corresponding category symbol strings reducible by cancellation to the sentence symbol S.","In [1] Ades and Steedman offer a form of categorial grammar in which some of the notations and concepts of the usual categorial grammar are modified. The formalism at first appears to be more powerful, because in addition to tile cancellation rule there are several other metarutes. IIowever, on closer ex amination there are other reasons to suspecl, that tile resulting language class (lifters sharply from that of the traditional grammars. Among the new rules, the forward partial rule (FI) rule) is most interesting, since one may immediately conchlde that this rule leads to a very large number of possible parsings of any sentence (almost equal to the number of different binary trees of n leaves if the length of the sentence is n). But its effects on the generative power of categorial grammar are not really obvious and immediate. Ades and Steedman raised the question in the footnote 7 in [1] and left it unanswered. We will first formally define categorial grammar and the associated concepts. Then we analyze the generative power of the categoriat gralnmars with different interesting combinations of the reduction rnles.","The categorial gralrnnars considered here consist of both a categorial component and a set of reduction rules. The category symbols differ from the traditional ones hecause they are parenthesis-free. The categorial component Cmlsists as before of a set VA of atomic categories including a distinguished symbol S, and a lexical function F mapping words to finite sets of categories. However, the definition of category differs: (1) VA is asubset of CA, (2) ifXisin CA, and Aisin VA, thenX/Ais in CA. Notice that the category symbols arc parenthesis free; the implicit parenthesization is left to right. Thus the symbol (A/(B/C )) of traditiolml categorial grammar is excluded, since A/B/C abbreviates ((A/B )/C ). ltoweve.r, some of the rules treat A/B/C as though it were, in fact, (A/(B/C )). ])EHNITIONS","Notation. We use A, B, C to denote atomic category symbols, and U, V, X, Y to denote arbitrary (complex) category symbols. The number of occurrences of atomic category symbols in X is I X I' Strings of category symbols are denoted by x, y. Mor pheme, s are denoted by a, b; *norpheme strings by u, v, w.","A categorial grammar under certain reduction rides is a qua druple G1¢ : (VT, VA, S, F), where: VT is a finite set of morphelnes, VA a tinite set of attolnic categories, S E VA a dis tinguished elelnent, F a function from VT to 2 cA such that for every a E VT, F(a) is finite, where CA is the category set and is defined as: i) if A EVA, then A E CA, ii) if X E CA and A C VA, then X/A E CA, iii) nothing else is in CA.","The set, of reduction rules R can include any combination of the folh)wing: (1) (F Rule) If U/A E CA, A E VA, the string U/A A can be","replaced by U.

When it WOIl~t cause confusion, we write Gf¢ to denote a categori al grammar with rule set R, and specify a categorial grammar by just spe, cifying its lexicon F.","The reduce relation > on CA* x CA* is defined as: for all oq fl E CA* and all X,Y,Z E CA, o~XYfl -> o~Z[3 if XY--, Z.

GRAMMARS W[TI1 I,'OItWARD CANCELLATION ONLY We begin by looking at the most restricted form of the 199 reduction rule set R = {F}. The single cancellation rule is the forward combination rule. It is well known that traditional categorial grammars are equivalent to context--free grammars. We examine the proof to see that it still goes through for categorial grammars GR with R = IF}. Theorem The categorial grammars GI~, R = {F}, generate exactly the context free langnages. Proof (1) l,et GR be a eategorial grammar with R = IF}. Gt~ becomes a traditional categorial gralnmar once parentheses are restored by replacing them from left to right, so that, e.g., A/B/C becomes ((A/B)/C). Hence, its language is CF.","(2) To show that every context- free language can be obtained, we begin with the observation that every context free language has a grammar in Greibach 2 form, that is, with all rules of the three forms A ~> aBC, A -> aB, and A -> a, where A,B, C are in VN and a is in VT [6]. A corresponding classical categorial grammar can be irnmediate]y constructed: ~\"(~) ~-I((A/C)/B), (A/B), A}. These are the categories A/C/B, A/B, and A of a parenthesis free categorial grammar. The details of the proof can be easily carried out to show that the two languages generated are the same. CRAMMARS WITH BACKWARDS CANCELLATION",":['he theorem shows that with R = {F} exactly the context free languages are obtained. What happens when the additional metarules are added? We examine now parenthesis-free categorial grammars with R = {F, B} and R = {F, P, s}. Rule B s is the version adopted in [11; B is an obvious generalization. In either case we are adding the equivalent of context free rules to a grammar; the result must therefore still yield a context free language. So one guess might be that categorial gram-- mars ol these types will still yield exactly the context free languages, perhaps with more structm'es for each sentence. An alternative conjecture would be that fewer languages are obtained, for we have now added some \"involuntary\" context free rules to every grammar. Example: Consider the standard context free language L 1 = { a\" b n ] n>0}.Theea~alestgrammaris S-> aSb, S-> ab. The Creibach 2 form grammar is S -> aSH, B ->b, S -> aB. The constructed categorial grammar GI~ then has f(a)= {S/B, S/B/S} and F (b) = {B }. If R = IF}, this yields exactly I, v Ilowever, with R = {F, B} or R = {F, B s}, here equivalent, GR yields alanguage L2 = {ab, ba, aabb, abab, bbaa, baba, baab, ... }, which contains L1 and other strings as well. It is the language of the context free grammar with rule set {S ->bC, S -> Cb, C -> aS', C-> Sa, C-> a}. Reversible languages. Let x 1¢ be the reverse of string x. That is, ifx = ala2\" \" \" an (a, E VT), then x R = a,~ ..\" a2al. Call a language L reversible if x EL iff x n EL. Examples: The set of all strings on {a, b} with equal numbers of a's and b's is a reversible CF language. {a \"b I n >0} is not a reversible language. Theorem The languages of categorial grammars GR with R = IF, B} are reversible. Proof if x => *S, then z n => *S by a reduction whose tree is the mirror image of the one for x in which rules F and B have been interchanged. Theorem Let G,~ be a categorial grammar with R contains {F, B} or {l\", B s }- R may or may not also contaln some form of FP rules. If L (G~) contains any sentence of length greater than one, then it contains at least one sentence w uv such that vu is also in L (GR)."]},{"title":"200","paragraphs":["Proof Let w be a sentence of L (G n ) of length greater than one.

No form of FP can be used a~q the final step of the reduction to S, so its presence does not affect the result. Corollary There are context free languages that cannot be obtained by any categorial grammar G~, where R contains {F, B} or {F, B s}. CATBGORIAL GRAMMAR, IS CONTEXT-FREE 1F THE FP RULE IS RESTRICTEI)","Tile method that had been used to construct a context free grammar G equivalent to a classical categorial grammar can be formally described as following:","/~ / Foreaehae VT, ifX~ F(a),then put X -> a in G;","For each derivable category X/Y, put X ~ X/Y Y in G. This method remains valid when B s rule is added. We just need to put an additional rule X -> Y X/Y in G whenever X is head ed by S. But this doesn't work when the FP rule is allowed. We might put in the CF rule U/V -> U/A A/V for each derivable category U/V and for each atomic category A, but in case there is a category like A/B/A, then any category symbol headed by A followed by B's and ended by A is a derivable category. There are infinitely many of them, so by using this construction method, we might have to put in an infinite number of CF rules. Therefore, this method does not always find a finite context free grammar equivalent to a category grammar with the FP rule. As we shall see, there may be no such context free grammar.","Let's now enf'orce some restrictions on the FP rule so that it won't cause an infinite number of derivable categories. Actually, using the FP rule sometimes violates the parenthesis convention, e.g. applying FP ~n 4 'B t? \"(?/D bnplle~ ~hat B/C/D is inter preted as (B/(C/D)). tlowever, by the parenthesis convention, B/C/D is the abbreviation of ((B/C)/D). Notice, however, when the second category symbol ha~ exactly two atomic sym bols, i.e., is in form A/B, the FP rule does not violate the convention. Coincidentally, if the FP rule is accordingly restricted as to FP z, the derivable category set becomes finite. Lemma For a categorial grammar G~(VA, VT',S,F), let RI={F,FP2}, R2={F,FP2, Bs}; and Rz={F,FPe, P,}, then DAI~ 1 = DAR2 = DAR3. Proof From the definition ii) of DA, we can see that any new category Z added to DA by a form of the B rule can be added by the F rule. The lemma follows.","[] Lemma The derivable category set DA of a eategorial grammar GI~ with R = /F, FP 2} is finite and constructible. Sketch of Proof We begin with the observation that none of the reduction rules in R increases the length of category symbols, and the initial lexical category symbols are all of finite length. This implies that the length of all the derivable category symbols are bounded. So there are only finitely many of them.","We now give an algorithm for computing DA, to show that, it is constructible. Algorithm: Compute DA of a Gn with R = {F , FP 2}. Input: A categorial grammar G R ( V T, VA, S, f' ) R ={F,FP2}. Output: DA of Ga.

[] Theorem For every categorial grammar G R ( V T , VA , S, F ), with R ={F,FP2, Bs}, there is a context free grammar G (VT, VN, S, P) such that L (G, t)=L (G). Sketch of Proof Since DA is finite, the method for converting CC to CFG described in last section works. [] Remark The theorem remains true for R being {F , FP 21 and IF , FP 2, B }, and can be similarly proved. We choose R = {F, FP 2, B s} to state the theorem because it is closest to Ades and Steedman's model [1]. THE FP RULE IS USEFUL ONLY ON S tIEADED CATEG ORIES","Now the next question is what if the I\"P rule is not restricted to U/A A/B -~ U/B. Intuitively, we can see that the application of the FP rule on a category which is not headed by S is not crucial in the sense that it carl be replaced by an application of the F rule, because whenever U/A A/V appears in a valid derivation to a sentence, the V part nlust be cancelled out sooner or later, so we can make a new derivation that cancels the V part first and get U/A A on which we can apply the F rule instead of the FP rule. But this doesn't hold if U/A is headed by S. For ex ample, when we have A S/B B/A, we can't do backward comb| nation on A and S/A if we don't combine S/B and B/A first. So, ~e expect that the weak generative power of categorial grammar would remain unchanged if the FP rule is restricted t~, bt used only on categories which are headed by S. This in fact follows as our next theorem. Lemma Given a categorial grammar Gi¢ ( VT , VA , S, F ) with R ={F,FP,Bs}, for any w E CA* and A ~VA, if there is a reduction w -->* A, then there is a reduction of w to C using FP rule only on categories which are headed by S. Sketch of Proof Formalize tile idea illustrated abow!. [] As an almost immediate consequence, we have: Theorem The language accepted by categorial grammar GIe(VT, VA,S,F) with R = {F,FP,Bs} is the same as tImt accepted with R = {F, FP s, B s }. Proof It trivially follows the lermna. [] Corollary FP rule is useless if there is no form of the B rule, i.e., any GIe (VT, VA, S, F) with R = {F, FP} will generate the same language ~us that germrated with R = {F}. A CONTEXT SENSITIVE LANGUAGE GENERATt{D USING UNRESTRICTED FP RULE","This section gives a categorial grammar with unrestricted FP rule thai. genera.tes a language which is not context free. Consid er categorial grammar G1 = GIe ( V A , V T , S, F ), where V T - {a, b, c }, VA -- {A, C, S}, r(a) = {A }, F(b) = {S/A/C/S, S/A/IU}, F(c) = {C},andR = {F,Bs,FP}. Claim 1 a i b i e' ~L (G1) for i > 0. Proof For any i. > O~ we can find a corresponding categorial string for a' b' c' : A' (S /A /C /S)i-t(S /A /C )C' . A reduc tion to S is straightforward. [] Let gb~ (a) denote the number of occurrences of a in string w. Claim 2 For all w ~ V T *, if w E L ( G I) then Cw(a) = ~ (b) = ~,0 (c). Proof First, it is ea~sy to see that from the lexical categories, we cannot get any complex category headed by either A or C, and we can get atomic category symbol A or C only directly from the lexicon.","Second, each morpheme b would introduce one A and one C within a complex category symbol which must be cancelh~l out sooner or later in order to reduce the whole string to S. In gen eral, there are two ways for such A and C being cancelled: (1) with an A headed or C headed complex category by the FP rule, which is impossible in this example; (2) with a single atomic category A or C by either the F or P, s rule. We have seen that such single A and C can only be introduced by the morpheme a and c, respectively. So 4) w (a) ::= q~,0 (b) = ~b w (c).","[] To show that L (G 1) is not context free, we take its intersec","tion with the"]},{"title":"regtl]ar","paragraphs":["language a*b:~c :~ . ]?,y claim 1 and 2, the in tersection is exactly the laugu;Lge {an b\" c ~' ] n > 0} which is well known to be non context free.

We can verify this by using a noudctermiuistic linear bounded auLomatoll to model the reduction process.

Itow can we reconcile this with the cnntext sensitive example abow~? The contradiction arises because the stack of their processor must be able to contain any derived eal~egory symbol of DA, and thus the size of the stack symbols is unlimited.
