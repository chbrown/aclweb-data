P.Larousse 9#241 Malakoff - France ABSIPACT","This paper describes an implemented tutoring system (2), designed to help students to generate clitic-constmctions in French. While showing various ways of converting a given meaning structure into its corresponding surface expression, tbe system helps not only to discover what data to process but also h~_~ this information processing should take_place. In other words, we are concerned with efficiency in verbal planning (performance).","Recognizing that the same result can be obtained by various methods, the student should find out ~dch one is best suited to the circumstances (what is kr~n, task demands etc. ). Infon~atiohal states, hence the preeesser's needs, may vary to a great extent, as may his strategies or cognitive styles. In consequence, in order to become an efficient processor, flu student }]as to acquire not only S]RUCilRa_ or RULE-KNOWLEDGE but also PROCEDLI~-~_EIX~ (skill).","With this in mind we have designed three modules in order to foster a reflective, experimental attitude in the learner, helping him to discover insightfully the ,Dst efficient strategy. i. ~TION","It is well known that the same output can be achieved by several methods. For example, a given set of sentences or texts can be generated by a variety of equivalent but different grammars. Any of U~se grammars can be used in numerous ways.","Grammars are generally noutra] with respect to processing (3). They pertain only to competence and performance factors such as memory load, focus of attention, etc. lie out of their scope. lh3oc~] different granmars may be equivalent in terms of their product -they all produce the same result, i.e. the same set of senfences- they certainly differ in te,~ns of the processing, that is to say in terms of their relative efficiency (speed, memory load, etc. ).","Whereas most scholars werking in the domain of generation de not deal with strategies (4) -they consider but one way to reach the solution- ~e will be concerned by the procedural inlolications of using a given gra, mar in a variety of ways.","Instead of having co,loeting grammars, we will take one of them (5) and l~elate its efficiency to the way it is used. ]]]is perfotmanoe-orionted approadl seems justified on theoretical as well as on practical grounds (economy and flexibility of processing).","Let us take, for example, a student who ~uld like to be-cone fluent in French. Obviously, he would have to learn not only what to process, but also how to process in order to efficiently convert a given meaning (conceptual graph) into its corresponding expression (seetenee). In oN~er werds, our student has to learn not only a set of gcammatical rules but also a set of strateqies or operating principles (6) powerful and flexible enough to get from a given input (meaning) to the output (sentence) in the most economic way, i.e. with the fewest operations, with the least storage, and wiN] the minimum amount of transformations. 2. PROCE55, FUNCTION OF STRUCTL~:","It is a well known fact that students learning French have diffienlties in producing fluently sentences with 2 pronoun ccmploments such as: Dis-le moi V-OO-lO Tell me (tell me it) Ne le lui dis pas! neg-DO-lO-V-neg Don't tell him (that)! Ii te le donnora S-IO-DO-V He'll (.live it to you Ii le lui deonera S-DO-IO-V He'll give it to him Je te pr6sente ~ elle S-DO-V-prep-lO I'Ii pres~]te you to her","It is interesting to find out why these constructions are so difficult to learn and to process. We believe that there are three basic reasons for this:","i) the structural idiesyneraeies oF the French system: mor~]ology and syntax are interdep~ant;","2) the procedural implications of this structure: many morphemes have an embedded structure (see below);","3) the resource limitations of the l~mn processor: being a serial processor, the learnor can focus his attention on but one thing at a time. 2.1 STRUCIIP#~ PARTICIIARITIES:","French pronoun constructions are complicated because syntax and morphology are interrelated, form as well as position depending upon each other. Their generation implies that one is capable of dete~nLning at least three things: - the fom] of a given referent: for example, the concepts SPEAKER or 3d PERSON can be realized in any of the following forms: SPEAKER: je, me, moi 3d PERSON: il, e].le, ils, dies, on, se, sol,","le, la, ies, lui, lent, cux; - its position: In the affinnative mode there are three positions or sentenceframes: a) 5-10-DO-V il me le pr4sente (he presents him to me) b) S-DO--IO-V il l-e lui pr4sente (he presents him to her) c) S-DO-V---prep-I_O0 il me ~sonte ~ elle(he presents me to her) - ~letber the preposition, inherent in the base, should be made explicit or not. As the examples (b) and (c) clearly show, the same verbeonstmction may or may not require elision of the preposition. Either one affects form as ~ell as position (7).","It should be noted that while most verbs allow only for two patterns in the. declarative mode ('a' and 'b'), those with an animate object such as 'pr6scnter' (to present) allow also for 'c'. 566 2.2 I-I~OCE1)LI~L ]M~tICATION~:","~tm lir~dsttc constraints operate on all levels: phono].~jicaI, mrphol(~jical and syntact.i.cal. a) H~onoloqi~il constraints:","lhe detemdnation of ~)rpbology generally requires three operations (porsen, case, nLraber and so~Keimes gender), yet: pronouns are n~nosyl.labie. ]in c~isequencc, one cannot plan tl~ i~xt pronoun while uttering tl~ eut'rc~lt one as the pronoun uttered is ton short and the time needed for planning the next ~e being too long. b) Morphological. om~straints:","There are number of cases where the indirect object has an embedded structure, i.e. U~. morl~ology of' the indirect object d ep~Js upon information cx~dng from the direct ~_~t (8). This implies intercupLion of a routine. Suppose that the sentence: 3d~ presents Paul to Mary is to be. prononinalized. Tile problem is ttk~ detemdnati~ of form and position of Lt~ prc~)nos, referring respectively to \"Paul\" ar~J to \"Mary\". The indirect ob~ (Mary) lexicalizes either as LUI or as EI£E, dopending upon ~,ther the direct ~.

(d) il me prgsenbe ~ EI_LE (he presents ~m to her) (e) il le LUI pr4sento (he presents him to her) e) 5Vntactical constraints:","lhe lir~r order of tile corlstitoents carl generally not be established, u~til both objects are known.

In that ease one I<nows its form but not tlcce~sarily its position ('f' or 'g'). This latter de~x~nds upon the vah~ of the indirect object. If U~ indirect object is in tlm first or second person it precedes the dit'ect objeet (g), otherwise it Pol- .lows it (f). Should ~e start by processing the indirect object before the direct one, we might have to keep tl~e fommr in working memory, lhis is precisely the case of \"f\" ~ere the indirect object is in U~e third person and not tmflexive. As one can see, in beth sih~tions one is faced with unwanted storage problems.","Obviously these structural particularities of tlm Frend~ pron(xm system have implication~ not only for U~e process of learning but also for the process of generation, namely: they exclude any ~ord-to-word processing, and they *~@Jire a certain amount of prepl~dng or look-algld.","~lat is needed tl~n, in order tO avoid false starts or correetions (bad<tracking), i.s global planninc~ on Um clause level rat)mr than local pl.annlnc~ on the word level.","In the light of tl~-~se facts one has to ad~t that gm treeration of pro~m constructions in Frend~ is i~ot all that simple.

It is U~s not surprising that students take a ].ong ti.~ to understand all U~ intricacies of the system, ~ieh would allow U~-ml eventually to integrate the rules into an efficient prccess-modei. 3.

It also shows under ~hat conditions movement of constituents are necessary. These per'- mutations are g~own on the screen, so that the user can learn ~deh features control those movements. Furthermore, the results of the processed date are shown on-line, i.e. the form and position of the ~ord determined are shown instantaneously. Finally the system tells ~hether the newly determined item can be articulated right away or not. The system is thus explicit with respect to rule knowledge and optimal in temm of processing. The result is obtained in the most economic way.","The disadvantage of this sys~-drivm processing reside in the fact that the solution, or more precisely, the method used to arrive at the solution, is shown but not discovered. Moreover, only one method is considered, hence the procedural knowledge remains implicit. Tim student will not even envisage other methods. He may thus know how to convert meaning into sentences, bat this knowledge being implicit, he will not know how to transfer it to other situations. 5,2 GUIDED DISCOVERY","The system still controls the nature of the operations but no longer controls their order. The latter is controlled, via strategies, by the user. He decides in what order to process tlm data, Having determined the subject, whose positions is invariable, one can choose from three strategies: - a syntactical one (syntactic-driven processing), - and two morphological ones (le~ical-ddven processing).","If priority is given to syntax, no reordering of constituents is meant to take place, i.e. all information pertaining to ~rd order is processed. The result is an ordered eategoriai structure or syntactical frame (h) @rich will be filled in by the merphologicai values determined later (i), for ex~lole: he gives it to her (h) sentence frame: Stl3~CT - DI~CT OBfCT - IN), 0B~CT - VERB (i) morpholo9~: il le lui - donne 568 If priority is given to morphelogy (lexically-driven generation), the form is determined before U~e relative order of the constituent elemeats. In this ease two strategies are possible: either one proeesses the direct or the iodi.rect object.","The efficiency of these three strategies is of course not the same. It is precisely the user's task to find out whidl of these strategies is tlm most efficient. The system invites him to compare these methods by applying certain performance criteria: - oumher of steps necessary to generate the sentence, - what is kno~ when ? (form/position), - congruence of inpet/output order (are permutations necessary? LIFO/FIFO) - are there any conceptual disruptions ? (9)","This experimental method should make the student aware of the fact that several strategies can be used to arrive at the solution. Ha should compare them with respect to certain criteria and reach his conclusions. 5.3 USER DRI~_N EtPERIMENTATION:","This method, like the previous one, is empirical. By playing with the system the student may gain certain insights about processing order,","A matrix appears on the screen, ~ose blank spaces have to be filled in by the student. The herizontal line ~lows the syntactic information given with tim input (verb, subject, object, preposition), -more inforfmltion is needed about those elements- tlm vertical line shows the nature of the information necessary to arrive at the output.","Thus the processing once again consists of tlm specification of the values of a llst of attributes. However there is a fundamental differences between this approach and tlm former, namely, the system has an inference mechanism. Each item of information given to the system is considered for its meaning potential, i.e. the system tries to fi.nd out whether some new facts can be inferred from the old fact.","It should be noted that the inference power varies with the nature of the data as ~ll as with their order, lhere are eases ~mre a single fact enables 3 other faet~ to he deduced (reflexives). A given inference ,my allow further deductions (inference-chain, knowledge propagation). This has of course an effect on Um process, tamely, tim greater the inference power, the greater tlm ecmow of precessing. This speaks for the following operating principle: the greater the inference power of a given piece of information, tim earlier it should be processed.","]his method is interesting in that, by testing different items and different order~ it makes possible to watch on the screen which items allow what inferences. Sinee those inferences depend upon the nature of the input as ~ell as on tim moment at ~hieh that information is given, we believe that this module is particularly useful in helping discover the best possible order of processing.","Furthermore we think that this method has another virtue, namely that it can simulate literally any knowledge state, thus me-king it possible, by experimental means to disoover the shortest path bet~en a given information state (input) and the solution (output). 6.
