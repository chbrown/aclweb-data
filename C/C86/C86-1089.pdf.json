However, they are not useful for information retrieval systems, because they cannot deal with the entities which cannot be universally represented by symbols.","In this paper, we propose a notion of semanUe space. Semantic space is an Euelidean space where words and entities are put. A word is one point in the space. The meanings of the word are represented as the spaee configuration around the word. The entities that cannot be represented by symbols can be identified in the space by the location tile entity should be settled in. We also give a learning mechanism for the space. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by an experiment on information retrieval for the study of Japanese literature. 1. Introduction","There have been no theories of semantics we can rely on for building a large information retrieval system. The defect in the existent theories is the lack of explanation of the mechanism for adjusting to tile real world the formal symbolic systems used in the theories; the only tMng they explain is the relation between natural language and the formal system. Those theories assume the existence of fixed and universal one-to-one relations between the basic elements in the formal system and tile entities m tile real world. For example, both Montague semantics and the situation semantics assume that we can represent the dog named Morris in the real world as some symbol like MORRIS in the formal system and that the relation between Morris and MORRIS is fixed and universal [3,2].","However, when we consider an information retrieval system, especially in the field of study on literature, we encounter problems where the assumption does not hold. One problem is that there are entities that do not have universal symbolic representation. For example, when a researcher discovers a new entity(or notion) in literature and writes a paper on that entity, the paper must be stored in the database but we do not have appropriate key words for that entity. When tile entity becomes well known in later years, it may be named, for example, 'overthereism'. However at the time tile entity is discovered and does not have the name 'overthereism', we must represent tile entity by a fixed set of symbols, but it is not easy. Another problem is that the range of what is meant by a symbol differs among the users of an information retrieval system. For example, we cannot identify the fixed meaning of 'romanticism'. Every user assumes different meanings of 'romanticism' and it is not easy to control the meaning. The latter problem has been considered in the studies of fuzzy meanings, but, so far, the former problem has not been considered m the studies on semantics.","In order to solve the above mentioned problems, we propose a notion of semantie space and the learning mechanism of the space. Our assumption is that the entities which could not be represented by a fixed set of symbols can be identified in some semantic space by the location the entity should be settled in. Although whether this assumption is universally valid is problematic, we have proved that this assumption is effective in information retrieval systems in the field of studies on literature. We believe that the fieht of literature includes essential problems and has"]},{"title":"jnst","paragraphs":["enough complexity to give as evidence for a general discussion on semantics.","The semantic space is an Euclidean space where entities and words are scattered. Tile crucial point of our idea is that the axes of the space are not given beforehand but are generated through learning from 374 tile interaction between a user' and the iuformation retrieval sy:¢tem. Since tile axes of t, he space are not given beforehand, the system can adjust the configuration, of tile space for absorbing new entities.","In chapter 2, we describe in detail the notion of semantic space, explaining what are the entities and words in an information retrieval system for lit,era-Lure studies, and we show how the meanings of words are represented in the space.","In chapter 3, we describe tile learlting mechanism of the semantic space. Generally speaking, in tile studies on machine learning, it. has been revealed that the mechanism for controlling the learning process is important; without such mectlanisms, the result of tile learning becomes Leo general or too specific. Ill the learning process proposed ill this paper, we use a user's satisfaction as tile eontrollhlg criterion for' learning. The result of the learning is a semantic space that just mirrors tile world of literature existing in the user's mind. The reason we use the term 'learning' instead of 'acquiring' is that the information the system gets is not tile direct exprcs.- sion of the meanings of words a user' has in his mind but indirect and partial i~tformaLion giveu Lhrongh the interaction between a user and the information retrieval system.","Ill chapter 4, we evaluate Lhe effectiveness of the proposed ideas through all experiment. IL is shown LhaL entities that could not be retrieved by conventional key words can be rctrie.ved in our' system.","In chapter 5, we refer to related works and summarize our contribution. 2. Semantic Space","Before giving formal discussion, we first give an example of semantic space. Fig.1 shows an example of semantic space for philosophical issues ill artificial intelligence ( * ).","We call find ill the space shown in Fig.l, the book titled \"Goedel, Escher, Bach\" written by Hofstadtcr, as on.e entity.

Until then, the notion is identified as Some blank space above the book.","A user who wants to get a paper or a book on the same notion as one written in Hofstadter's book can find the notion in the space by looking at the configuration of the space.","One might think that we can represent the new notion intensionally. However, in practical information retrieval systems, it is difficult to fix the set of primitives for representing intension.","One might also think that identification of the location is similar to making conjunction of several keywords or to using a thesaurus. However, our semantic space has the prominent feature, which is absent in using keywords er thesaurus, that a user can embed his own ideas of meanings in the space. The only criterion for determining the space organization is a user's satisfaction. Every user has his own space in our system, and the system designer doesn't care whether one direction in tile space denotes ISA relation or synonymic relation or else. Even tile user himself may not know what kind of relation tile axes represent in the space. However, as far as the user has his own idea about how one entity is related with other entities, the semantic space mirrors tile world in the user's mind, and the axes (maybe in local subspace) as a result play the role of representing the relation between the entities such as ISA relation, synonymic relation, temporal relation, spatial relation, or a more complex relation.","So far, we have already described the main ideas of semantic space through an example. Now we give formal discussion.","The first question is what is the dimensiou of the space. The dimension of the semantic space is not given at first in principle. The dimension is determilled as a result of space synthesis. Mathematical theories for calculating the dimension are given in theories of multi-dimensional synthesis developed in the studies of statistics. In our implementation, we limit the dimensions to three for the sake of simplicity of the system. Moreover, we give one fixed meaning to one dimension, that is, we give tile meaning of symbolization to the vertical axis. At the bottom of the space, titles and authors of papers are arranged. At the top of tile space, words which users use are arranged. At tile middle of the space, writers and literary works and some controlled notions such as \"stylistics' are arranged. The reason we named tile vertical axis \"symbolization' is that the upper space is a more symbolized world from tile viewpoint of a bibliographical database.","The second question is what words and entities are. In our semantic space, we don't make clear distinetion among the terms \"entity', 'notion' and 'word'. What exist ill our space are, in any way, just symbols. But conventionally, we call the symbols that are used by users, 'words'; the ones that are 376 pointed to bibliographical information 'entities(papers)', the ones that denote writers 'entities(writers)', the ones that denote works 'entities(works)', and others, 'notions'. As for the symbols that denote writers and works, they are controlled by an independently developed database for authentication.","The third question is what is meaning. We define the meaning of one symbol as the space configuration around the symbol. Moreover, we extend tile notion of symbol to ally point in semantic space, so that we can treat entities for which a symbol is I~ot assigned. Ill other words, we identify a symbol with a point in space. For example, what the location for 'Hofstadterism' means is something between wholism and reduetionism. You can understand what 'something between' in the previous sei1tence means by looking at the configuration of tile neighbor space. For example, if you see neighbor \"Prolog' between 'declarative' and 'procedural', you know that \"something between' means tile same kind of relation as 'Prolog' between \"declarative' and 'procedural'. It must be noted here that tile same symbol can be put in more than one location. This allows a symbol to have several meanings depending on context.","The last question on the semantic space is what the distance is. The measure of distance exists in the user's mind. This is not elusion but essence. There is no explaining by what measures one researcher on literature judges that. one entity is near another entity. It is because each researcher has his own measures that original papers can be written [personal discussion with some researchers on literature]. Since the semantic space is built for each user, the papers of the authors who have a quite different semantic world from that of the user may not have \"proper\" location in the semantic space. Sut that causes little problem, because such papers do not interest tile user much.","3. Learning the Space","The outline for the use and learning of semantic","space for an information retrieval system is as fol-","lows:","1. A user gives a query to the information retrieval system. The query is recognized as a sequence of words. Parsing of the query sentence is not done. So users generally give what they think are key words for search. For example, a user who wants a paper on the influence of Goethe oil modern Japanese literature asks the system 'Goethe modern Japanese literature'.","2. The system searches in the semantic space for the same words tile user gave. If such words are found, the system presents to the user the neighbor spaces of the words. If no such words are found, the system presents an","overview of the whole space (mainly the","middle space, i.e. the space for writers and","works). 3. The user selects some subspaces that attract","him. 4. The system shows the details of tile bottom","spaces of selected subspaces. 5. The user selects papers from among those","shown in the bottom spaces. 6. The system re-constructs the semantic space","so that the selected papers in step 5 are","located in shorter distance and selected sub-","spaces ill step 3 are located in shorter dis-","tance, and then th.e system puts tile query","words in the location above the selected","papers. We have implemented a system called","ML0(Model Learner version0) that realizes the","above mentioned steps. Fig.2 shows the","configuration of the system. The system is written","in Lisp and P][,/I. Tile monitor monitors all tile functions of the","system. It has special variables named *inconsistent","and *attention. qnconsistent is the variable for storing a pair' of","entities for which the distance in the semantic space","is different from the estimated distance. The estima-","tion of the distance is done as follows. When the","initial semantic space is built, the distanec between","two papers is estimated, with some normalization, by","the inverse of the number of occurrences of same","words in tile titles, and the dist.anee between two"]},{"title":"~ n -m~ .... ~user communication~~ - ~T~ \"[ controller r'L___....J~,~ i!

When tile semantic space is reconstructed, the distance between entities which a user selected is estimated to some fixed small value, and the distance between entities which the system presented, but only one of which the user selected, is estimated to some fixed large value. The monitor judges that a user is satisfied if the real distance ill semantic space is tile same as the estimated distance. When the monitor detects the user's dissatisfaction, i.e. the difference between the real distance and the estimated distance, it registers in *inconsistent the pair of entities which caused the problem.","*attention is the w~riable for limiting the space for consideration. The monitor monitors the spac.e only ill the scope of *attention. This improves the efficiency of search and reconstruction.","The monitor triggers the space reconstructor after one session of query and answer if *inconsistent has value.","The space reconstructor plays the role of reconstrucUng the semantic space so that the user can be satisfied.

However, the above mentioned heuristic procedure works more efficiently than mathematical methods, because so many pairs causing inconsistency are not detected at once due to the limitation of attention and rather small density of the world of literature. 4. Evaluation","First of all, we estimated the size of the semantic space. The number of writers studied in the field of research on Japanese literature is about 1900. The number of works studied is about 2200. Fortunately, these numbers are almost fixed. The number of papers written in that field in a year is about 5000. However, interest of one researcher is limited to less than one tenth of them.","We then confirmed, by asking some researchers and by analyzing the process of manual editing of research paper catalogues, that almost all notions in research on Japanese literature can be placed in positions among writers and works. For the notions that cannot be placed among writers and works, about 100 notions such as dialectology were prepared for building an initial space.","Finally we carried out an experiment by using the implemented system. Estimating the size of the semantic space for one user, we made an initial space in which 50 writers were registered. For building the initial space, we made a 50*50 distance matrix for the writers based on tile information from tile titles of '53563 papers written in the last ten years. The initial space made by tile system is shown in FigA. 'Pile initial space itself is interesting enough for' literature study. We can know from tile space tile striking fact that tile poet named Bashou in the seventeenth century has a strong relation with many modern novelists. We can also infer that many researchers have special interest in female writers, finding tile subspaee where ancient and modern female writers are clustered.","We asked a researcher on Japanese literature to search papers based on a complex query. One query was \"on the process of transformation of fables into written forms, how fables were transferred among people, ecology of fables\"(*). Looking at the semantic space, he first roughly enclosed in the space about ten works which he thought to be related to \"fables\". Glancing at the bottom space of them, where 1337 papers (written in the last ten years) were scattered, he could point out 112 papers which matched the query.","The selected papers which included in tile titles words such as nature, development, transfer, fablizalion, or generation were gathered into one subspace by the system after the session, and the user's query was registered above tile subspace. This means that, next time, the system can give the answers to the","(*)The query was given in Japanese. This is a tranMation made by the authors 378 same query at once, and can register, in the proper subspace, new papers on tile same notion.","The greatest merit of the semantic space was that the system could tell tile user what it knew about the things related to the user's request. In conventional systems which depend on key words, users must imagine what words the system knows; in fact, tile subject of the experiment could not give proper key words for the complex query. In contrast with this, the at~ility of the user to point out the subspaccs he wants by just glancing at the whole presented space was more than we expected. 5. Related Works","'£he most related work is Rieger's[7,8]. He also made some kind of semantic space from the infer ~ marion of relations among words. However, he made thc space based only oil tile frequency of cooccurrences of words ill sentences. Our semantic space carl have more realil,y about meo, nings than his, because symbols that are actually connected to entities stored in tile database exist in our st)ace.","In the sense of treating entities which do not have symbolic represeul, ation, conneetionist models[4,9] have some relation with our approach. llowever, it seems that the eonneetionists have not yet realized the process of yielding symbols on con ~ nection networks that can represent such abstract notions as dealt with by our system.","From the methodological point of view, methods developed in the studies of multi-dimensional synthesis in statistics are related to ours. The reason we have developed methods to calculate tile space independently from those methods is similar to one menUoned by Lebowitz[6]. That ix, we are noL interested in mathematical rigidness of the process of analyzing data, but in modeling what occurs m tile human mind.","1,'rein the viewpoint of information retrievalsysteens, there are many more requests than those answered by our approach. They include treating structures of key words more explicitly, understanding tile user's intention from his query[l], or making co-operative responses[5]. However, the previous studies on those problems started ignoring tile most basic problem of understanding and learning the meanings of one word. Our work can give an assured starting point for' those further studies. 6. Conclusion","We proposed to represent the meanings of words in space. We gave a learning mechanism for tile space. We proved tile effectiveness of the proposed methods in an information retrieval system.","One of the reasons we chose the field of Japanese literature was that there was strong demmld from th.e researchers in that field to make a useful system; systems based on conventional key words did riot work welt for the field of literature.","Another reason is that the field offers good examples of entities for which universal symbolic representation is difficult.","To apply our method to other fields, we must solve only two problems. One problem is to select symbols to be put ill tile initial space. In literature, works and writers played tile role. Ti~e other problem is to determine criteria for space configuration. We used a user's satisfaction wittl the answers from the information retrieval system as tile criterion. If these two problems are solved, our method can be applied to any domain. \"l'hcsc problems do uot seem so difficult.","From the viewpoint of artificial intelligence, the. semantic space Rives a basis for studies on abduetion an.d analogy. The diseovery of blank space snr.- rounded by symbols carl lead to discovering of new ideas by mac]tines. Siuce we can measure semantic similarity directly by distance in semantic space, wc can make analogical reasoning based oil that similar-. ity. For the same reason, from the linguistic point of view, the semantic spac, e e~l be useful for under.. standing metaphorical expression such as \"Hofs.. tadter is Prolog between procedural semantics and declarative semantics\".","References","[llAllen,,L:Recognizing Intentions from Natural Language Utterances, in Brady,M,,Berwiek,R.C (eds.): CoTnputatlonal Models of Di~eou'me.
