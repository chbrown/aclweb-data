The pm'allel model is based on the Semantic Definite Clause Grammar formalism and integrates syntax and semantics through the commmfication of processes. The main proeessess, of which there are six, contain either purely syntactic or purely semantic information, giving the advantage of simple, transparent algorithms dedicated to only one aspect of parsing. Communication between processes is used to hnpose semantic eonst,'aints on the syntactic processes. 1. Introduction","This paper describes parallel model for natural language parsing and gives a design for its implementation. With the advent of parallel machines, it may be possible to view the relation of syntax and semantics in natural language parsing in a wholly new way. The approach is moving towards an application environmeat which is similar to the heterarchical sytem proposed by Winograd [Winograd"]},{"title":"721.","paragraphs":["Processes which control the syntactic aspects can be separated from those which control the semantic aspects in that the syntactic processes contain no semantic information themselves, but receive it by communication with the semantic processes, and vice versa. The advantage of this approach is that transparent algorithms can be written that are dedicated to only one aspect of parsing, while the desirable effects of integrating syntax and semantics can be achieved through the communication of processes. In our model we use this communication to enforce semantic constraints on the syntactic processors in order to avoid the combinatorial explosion of producing all legal syntactic possibilities.","Communication between the two components is then our focus in designing a parallel parser. There seem to be three obvious levels at which communication between syntax and semantics can take place: the word level, tim phrase level, and the sentence level. We have chosen to consider communication at the phrase level rather than at either of the other two because it would be too early for the syntactic and semantic components to communicate at the word level (too little information is available at this level to help the parsing), and too late for them to communicate at the sentence level (too many syntactic parses might have already been \"produced). How the communication between the syntactic and semantic components takes place at the phrase level will be described in Section 3.","In Section 4, we design an hnplementation of this pa,'allel model for a 6-Hypereube lintel 85] multlprocessing system, which we will have available shortly. The 6-Hypercube has"]},{"title":"sixty-four","paragraphs":["identical processors (Intel 80286's with 512K bytes of memory) and no shared memory. Although each node in the Hypereube can eventually communicate with any other node, each processor can directly communicate with only six immediately neighboring nodes. We therefore intend to limit our message passing among processors to immediate neighbors whenever possible.","Like the work of Eiselt [Eiselt 85] on parallel inference processing, we have a pers]~icuous assignment of natural language processing moaules to processors in the machine, although we are suggesting a parallel implementation of a parser with much more parallelism and with a clearer separation of syntax and semantics. The work on \"massively parallel parsing\" by Waltz and Pollack [Waltz 85 models various components of eompreheilsion by a~tivation and inhibition of nodes of a network. A practical applieation of their approach requires massively parallel processing, currently beyond the state of l, he art in multiprocessing.","We base our parallel model on the Semantic Definite Clause Grammars (SDCG) formalism of Huang Illuang 85. The SDCG evolve'd from the I)efinite Clause Gra,nmars of Pereira [Pereira et al 80 and is described below. 2.

Parallel Parsing The model consists of six processes which con>","munlcate to produce all the semantically compatible","parses of a given sentence.

Wimnever a noun piu'ase is searched for, the noun phrase master is invoked to produce all possible initial noun phrases in the remainder (tllc unparsed portion) of the input string. After the main verb of any clause imps been identified by tim sentence master, the SV-master is invoked to produce all possible verb senses which are meaningfulat this point in the parse. Ill tim case that a transitive verb is found and a possible word sense fox\" the object noun is determined, the VO-master is consulted as to wheti~er or not the given verb word sense and object noun word sense are acceptable as a verb-object pail'.","In communicating witl~ the NP-master or SV-master, several possibilities may be returned to the sentence master, and the parse is continued fox\" each of these possibilities in parallel.","Tile NP-master, which is also a syntactic process, finds all possible initial noun phrases which are meaningful by using its own syntactic information (in a top down manner)and by communicating with tile AN-master for semantic information. This communication is similar to that of the sentence master witll tile SV-master. After determining an adjective which is followed by a noun, ti~e NP-master invokes the AN-master to tind all meaningful adjective-noun word sense pairs. Multiple adjectives which modify a noun are considered in parallel by the AN-master, which in ti~is ease, returns pairs which consist of a list of adjective word senses and a noun word sense. Whenever the NP-master reeives a pair from the AN-master, it continues any work that it might lmve (such as finding prepositional pin'ascs which modify tile noun, e.g. 'the big boy in the park'). If several pairs are returned by the AN-master, the remainder of the parse is handled by the NP-master and is done in parallel when possible.","The sentence master produces all the parses of the sentence that have not been blocked.

While the sentence master is receiving its .input and begins the processing described above, the semantic dictionary master simultaneously finds all possible word senses for cacti input word. The semantic dictionary contains an entry mr each sense of a word. The structure of each entry reveals its syntactic category. Word senses corresponding to nouns contain only the semantic class to whici~ the word sense belongs. For example, the semantic dictionary entry fox\" tile noun \"name '~ (as in the gh'l's name) is given by:","sere(name1, [>ad(sign)l ).","Adjective word senses contain the semantic class of the noun that it prefers to modify. The adjective \"specific\" has the following entry:","sere(specific1, [poss(sign)]).","Word senses corresponding to verbs m'e described witi~ a structm'e which contains the class of the subject that is prefered by this verb, the class of' the object prefered, and the semantic class of tim verb itself. The verb \"name\" (\"to name a dog\") is represented as:","sere(name2, [subj(man), obj(man), head(make)l ).","After finding all possible word senses for words in the input sentence, the semantic dictionary master sends these dictionary entries to the appropriate semantic processes. Verb entries are sent to the SV- and VO-masters, adjectives are sent to the AN-master, and nouns arc sent to all three. These three process masters then contain a \"cache\" of the semantic dictionary entries relevant to the parsing of the present input sentence. The purpose of the \"cache\" is so that the semantic dictionary entry fox\" any input word can be quickly found by the processes which use these entries. 4. The Design of the system",">k","We describe the design of the implementation of the parallel parsing model. Each of the six processes consists of a tree of processors. We label the root of each process tree with the name of the process that it represents. The design of the semantic processors and the noun-phrase master is independant of tim implementation of the SDCG which is used. The design of the sentence master, however, is heavily dependant on the formal grammar used for the SDCG implementation as the parser fox' XTRA. The two syntactic processes above, the NP-master and the sentence master, have a significantly more complex design than those of the semantic processes so that different possible syntactic alternatives may be considered in parallel. *Although tile actual implementation has not begun, we hope to do so by summer 1986 when the Hypercube multiproeessor will have been ready for use. 142","4.1. The sentence master The desi~;n of tile sentence master is based on the","following production rules of the SDCG: sentence--> sentence 1)ody. sentence --> sentence head, scntence_flody.","Intuitively, we (:an consider the sentence head to be wbateve,' appears before the scntenee snbje~"]},{"title":"0t","paragraphs":["can be an empty string), and the sentence body Lo be the remainder of the sentence.","The sentence master, as illustrated below, can be thought of as the root of a tree which h~s two children whieh we will refer to as the sentence monitors: the sentence head monitor (SH-monitor) and the sentence body monitor (SB.-monitor).
