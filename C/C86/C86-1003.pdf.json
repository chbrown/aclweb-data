We set up four concepts :in heighest level ; \"Concrete objects\", \"Abstract concepts\", \"Phenomena\", and \"lluman actions\". Concrete objects are the selfsame objects in the world. Abstract concepts are the standards which fix intellectual activities of hunlankind. Phenomena include both social, phenomena and natural phenonlena. [[unlan actions are the selfsame acted by humans. Wc assigned facets to these four concepts. Then we further extracted the feature of a park from these facets and assigned a new facet \"Parts ° .","Similarly, another coneept of \"Attribute\" was extracted from °Phenomena ° and \"lluman actions\". This feature is crucial especially for action nous. Thus we added two faeeLs; \"Parts\" and °Attribute\". Nouns also include concepts of measurement, space & topography and time. So we added three facets; \"Measurements\" , \"Spaces & Topography\", and \"Time\".","We classified into lnore concepts as follows.","The concept of concrete objects arc- classified into \"Nations & Organizations', °Animate objects' arid \"inanimate objects\" which cons t] Lute three independent concepts. The concept of Ihmlan actions was elassifJ ed t.wo facets, \"Sen:~e & Feel ing\" and \"Actions °.","We rallied the scope formed by the concept \"conceptual category\". It is difficu]k to define the conceptual scope e.xplicitly. The concept which can be defined explicitly in the conceptual category is called a facet. The facet i.s subc]assifJed into a number of semantic slots. This relation is illustrated i.n fir:ure 5.1. /. \"'-~ ..... \"\" \"-. /a semantic slot ,' I t_-----,--~--~ sei~lantic marker , ~ ........... \" cateqory a facet [ facet name","Figure 5, I Relationship between Facet and ~em_ant ie Mm:kerN","2) SubclassJfication of Facets","Facets, for example, were subclassified into slots as follows, the facet of Animate objects was subclassified as semantic slots °humans\", \"animals ~ , and \"plants ° The facet of Phenomena was subelassified as slots \"natural phenomena\", \"physical phenomena ° , \"power and energies\", \"physiological phenomena\", °social phenomena ° and \"social systems and customs'. We then set up an \"others\" slot in each facet, for these words which cannot he assigned to any slot. The use of these slots is explained in section 5.3. We will study \"others\" slots through semantic analysis for nouns; new slots or facets may have to be assigned.","These semantic slots and facets are named semantic markers. The System of Semantic Markers for Nouns is shown in figure 5.2. The system of semantic markers for nouns is made up of 13 conceptual facets including ~Others ° markers, and 49 fiiial slots as term i nal s.","We also use Special. Semantic Markers for \"functional words\" which represent some patterns, syntactic or semantic information. For exmnple, the word \"comparison\" presupposes more than two nouns(arguments); comparison between \"A\" and \"B ° . Then, \"WK(Relation)\" as a special semantic marker is attached to the word °comparison\". The word \"time ° assumes time case.

The first problem is simple mistakes made by humans. The second problem is a fluctuation of semantic analysis due to a large amount of data. So it is necessary to develop an automatic marking system to save time and to improve efficiency.","P) When assigning semantic markers to nouns, we attached them without considering the relationship between nouns and verbs. That is, we attached semantic markers simply based on noun concepts. This is not adequate to handle nouns which are intrinsically related to verbs. One of the solutions to this problem will be to study the correlation matrix of the semantic markers for nouns in relation to the case frame of verbs.","3) Our system of semantic markers for nouns has been designed for Japanese nouns. We have to design a syst~, of semantic mgrkers for English nouns. Since recognition for its concept in an Enlish word is very difficult for the Japanese, we are also studying a method of evaluation test to handle these data.","4) Our system of semantic markers for nouns simply consists of the tree structure of facets and slots. Subclassification for these structures with deep tree structure is a significant problem in order to analyze the concept of nouns more in detail, but such a semantic marking operation will bec~ne more c~nplex and difficult for I), 2) problems.","5) We suppose that a concept system for words is not a static structure, but various semantic networks constructed dynamically according to a given sUory.","We must give thorough consideration to this prospective problems. ~efereBces !n Enfl tLsh","(1) Sakamoto, Y., SaLoh, M. and Ishikawa, T.: Lexicon Features for Japanese Syntactic Analysis in Mu .Project JE, COTING84, Stanford, 1984.","(2) Nagao, Makoto:Struetural transformation in the generation stage of Mu Japanese to English machine translation system, Theoretical and methodological Issues in machine translation of nakural language, Hamilton, New York, 1985.","(3) TsujJi, Jun ichi:Science and Technology Agency's Machine Translation Project, Proceeding of the International Symposium on Machine Translation, JIPDEC, Tokyo, 1985.","(4) Nakai, H. and Satoh, M. ; A Dictionary with Taigen as its Core, Working Group Report of Natural Language Processing in Information Processing Society of Japan, WCNL 88 7, July, 19~3.","(5) Nagao, M. ; Introduction to Mu Project, WGNL 382, 196~3.","(6) Sakamoto, Y. ; Yougen and Fuzoku-go Lexicon in Verbal Case Frame, WGNL 38 8, 1983.","(7) Ishikawa, T., Satoh, M. and Takai, S.; Semantical Function on Natural Language Processing, Proc. of 28th CIPSJ, 1984.","(8) Nagao, M., Tsujii, J. , Naka~lura, J. , Sakamoto, Y., Torinmi, T. and Satoh, M: Outline of machine traslation project of the Science and Technology Agency, Journal of Information Processing, Vol .28, No. 10, 1,985. 19"]}]}
