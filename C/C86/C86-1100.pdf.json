The skeleton of a FIG may be vlewed as a classical rnonollngual dictionary, augmented with one (or several) bilingual dictionary.

This constitutes the Machlne Alded Human Translatlon (\"MAHT\") aspect. Second, there may be a true Machine lranslation ( \"MT\" ) system, wh tell \" l ingware\" conststs of \"coded\" grammars and dictionaries, lhls Is the (human alded) MT aspect, abbreviated as \"HAMT\", or simply \"MT\", because human revision Is necessary even more for machine translations than for human translations.","The tern1 \"coded\" doesn't orlly mean that MT gr'armlar's and dictionaries are written In Specialized Languages for\" Linguistic Pr ogr anlnf rrg (\"SLLP\") , but also that the grammatical and lexical Information they contain is of a more \"formal\" nature. In some systems, the fòrmal lexical information ts a reduction (and perhaps ae oversimplification) of the Information found In usual dictionaries. But, tn all sophisticated systenls, it Is far more detailed, and relies on some deep analysis of the language. Moreover, tile access keys may be different: classical dtct 1charles are accessed by ]efftrlas, whl le formal d'lct looar tes may be accessed by morphs (roots, affixes...), ]el~]~ras, lexlcal units, and even other linguistic properties. Ill many systems written ill ARIANE--78 {1}, left, as are not directly used.","Efforts have beer] made to devise data base systems for the natural or the formal aspect , separately. Multillngual terminological data bases, such as TERMIUM I'B[I or EURODICAUTOM, Illustrate tt~e first type.","On tile other hand, the Japanese and the French National MT projects have developed specialized lexlcal data base systems ( \"LEXDB\" ) , in which the ( formal ) information is entered, and from WlllCll MT dictionaries are produced. More precisely, there Is a data base for\" each language (I.), and for eacl] pair of laeguages (L1,L2) handled by the MT system. From the first LEXDB, analysis and syntilesls MT dictionaries for I_ are automatlcally constructed, while transfer dictionaries for (L1,L2) are produced from tire second.","In all Integrated M(a)r system, it would be useful to maintain the two types of dlct ionar les in a unique structere, ill order to ensure coherency. rhls strLlcture would act as a \"pivot\", being the source of the \"natural\" view as well as of the \"formal\" dictioearles.

Tills is why some details given in this PaDer are already obsolete. However-, the spirit I~as remaleed the same.","lhe Ii/a~ll Idea Of the new organization ls to fntograte both types of dictionaries in a unlqtJe structllre, called \"for'l~.\" integrated dictionary, or \"I:ID'. A given FID tS associated with one natural laeguage and may give access to translations Into several other languages.","Hence, there would be only n FiGs for n languages. The f\"orm oF ~tle \"natural\" Dart has been designed to reflect the organl zat 1on o£ current modern usual dlct loner les. lhts is why we have limited ourselves to the \"fork\" architecture\", and have not attempted to constrtlct a Llnlque str'ueture for n languages.","In tile flrst part, we present tile \"skeleton\" of a Fill item, Part I1 shows how to \"graft\" codes onto It, and discusses the nature and place of tllose codes.

FORM OF AN ITEM 2_..!~ K~ s .~emma s L _ l e x 1 c al u 0 ItA","As illustrated above, an Item may consist of several lemmas, because of possible ambiguities between two canonical Forms (e.g. LIGHT-noun and LIGHT-adjective).","The corresponding LU Is always given.

In general, a lemma may lead to several constructions, a construction to several refinements, eacb deflQed as a \"meaning\", for lack ef a better word.","Further refinements may be added, to select various translations For a given meanlng. The Following diagram illustrates the idea.",".......................................................... 4","key !","__ _ l etTllla !","I constructlon !","! ! .... meaning/transl.

The presence of a construction may be tested In a sentence, but the notion of domain of discourse or of level of language Is obviously more global.","The notion of construction Is fundamental. In particular, predicative words cannot be translated in Isolation, and it Is necessary to translate expressions of the Form P(x,y,z), P being the predicate and x, y, z Its arguments, possibly with conditions on the arguments. Note that 1dloms or locutions are particular Forms of constructions.","In general, refinements may be local or global. Local refinements often consist In restrictions on the semantic features of the arguments (\"to count on somebody\" vs. \"to count on something\"). Global refinements concern the 424 domain, the style (level of discourse), or the typology (abstract, bulletln, article, ckeck-11st...).","In our view, a meaning In L1 ls translated by one or several constructions In L2.","We have then avoided to translate a meaning by a meaning, which might seem more logical. But this would have forced us to descrlbe the corresponding cascade of constraints In L2. As a matter of fact, It Is usually possible to reconstruct It, from the constraints tn L1 and contrastlve knowledge about L1 and L2. Hence, we follow the practice of usual dlctlonarles. 2~.3, TrAoslatlqns .C!--t~: \"fork\" dictionaries","We have shown how to include In an Item Its translations Into several target languages. Hence the term \"fork\". The \"handle\" Of the item consists In all information concerning the source language (L1). In order for such an organization to work, we must have at least 2 such dictlonarles, for L1 and L2, as no detailed information about 1_2 ls included In the Ll-based dictionary. This information may be found In the L2-based dlct 1chary, by look lng-up the appropriate ttem and locatlng the construction: the path from the key to the construction contains It. 3. F&CTORIZ_ATION ANp_ REFERENCE","AS seen In the examples, we introduce some possibllltles of naming subparts of a given len'~na, by simply number lng them (sees 3 refers to trad 1 In \"atmosph6re\" ).","This allows not only to Factorize some information, such as translations, but also to defer certain parts of the item. For example, translations might be grouped at tile end of the (linear) writing of an item. The same can be said of the formal part o¢ the Information (see be low). I_I ~_GRA.

Such a theory Is deflned by a set o¢ formal attr!butes, each of a well-defined type. For example, the morphosyntactlc class might be defined as a scalar attrlbute: CATMS (VERB, NOUN, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, CONJUNCTION, etc. ) The gender might be defined as a set attribute: GENOER = ens (MASCULIN, FEMINTN, NEUTRE).","Each theory may glve rise to several implementations (]tngwares), each of them having a particular notation For represent lng these attributes and their values. Moreover, lr, a given llngware, the information relatlve to an Item may be distributed among several components, such as analysis, transfer and synthesis dictionaries.","Usually, comblnat Ions of particular properties (or\" at tr lbute/value pairs) are glven names and called cj asses,_ For example, In ARIANE-78, there are the \"morphologlcai\" and \"syntactic\" \"formats\", abbreviated as FTM and FTS, in the AM (mor phol oglca I analysis) diet lonar les. Special questionnaires, called \"indexing charts\", lead to the approprlate class, by asking global questions (vs. one particular question for each possible attr lbute). 1.2~ F_oEm of _Wbat...ls._~[rafted","In tile slmplest case, there ls one theory, and one corresponding 11ngware. Tile grafted part wtl] be of tile form: apJ3 info properties In the theory","code codes (classes and possibly basic properties) The keyword aPD means \"appended\".","In a A less simple case, there might be two theories, called and B, of French. Suppose that there ts an analyzer, FR1, and a synthesizer, FRA, corresponding to A, and two analyzers and a synthesizer (FR2, FR3, FRB), relative to B.

One could attach:","- the morphological codes (FTM) and the \"morphs\" to the roots (\"bases\") or to the lenin/as;","- the \"local\" syntaxo-semantic codes (FTS) to tbe ]ermlas or to the constructions;","- the \"global\" syntactic codes (concerning the typology) to the various levels of refinement;","- the codes concerning the derivations to the d~E1v parts, wherever they appear In the item."]},{"title":"£, AN_._E XAMPkE .(_'~'ATMO&R_HSR~ 'LI","paragraphs":["C16 \"atmosph6re\" lm c.1 N.F. ul_ --","aDD $13 A lnfo FLEXN=S, MORPH=\"atmosph~.re\",","DE R I V ='' a t mosph6r 1 que\"","code IS FR1 AM FTM FXN1","code [.C FRA GM FAF FXN1 th B l_nfo FLEXN=ES, MORPH='atmosph6r\",","ALTER=GRAVE, SUF=IOUE","code.

CONSTRUCTION OF INIEGRATED DICTIONARIES","Suppose the natural skeleton of an ltem ts obtained by using available dictionaries. There are two main methods for constructing the a~p parts.","First, one may begin by filling the lnfo parts. This Is tile tecllnlque followed by the two afore-mentioned national projects. For this, people without special background in computer linguistics laay be used. They fill questionnaires (on paper or on screen) asking questions directly related to the formal attributes. Thts information ls checked and inserted In the i nfo parts at the propel\" places, which are determined by knowing the relation between the \"natural\" Information and the \"theory\".","In a second stage, programs knowing the relation between the theory and a particular ltngware will fill the ¢.gde parts.","The second methods tries to make better use of existing MT dictionaries. First, the relation between the elements of a llngware and the \"natural\" system is defined, and programs are constructed to extract the useful Information from the MT dictionaries and to distribute It at the appropriate places. Then, knowing the relation between the \"coded\" Information and the theory, tnfg parts may be constructed or completed.","At the time this paper was revised, M.DYMETMAN was Implementing such a program to construct a FID from our current Russfan-French MT system. Hls results and conclusions should be the theme of a forthcoming paper.","Inconsistencies may be detected at various stages hq tbe construction of a Fib, and the underiylng DB (data base) system must provlde facilities for constructing checks, using them to locate incorrect parts, and modifying the item. Ill. PROBLEMS OF DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION","The construction of an Implemented \"mock-up\" has led us to identify some problems tn the design, to wonder whether there is any available DBMS (data base management system) adequate for our purposes, and to ask what should be done about the representation of characters, Ina multt 1 ingual setting. I_ I]E-[=ATION .B_E TWEE_N_ NATU RAL,_. AND F O RMA(- I N F 0 RMA!.I O_N","The relation between the formal information of a theory and the formal information of an implemented model of It (a llngware) Is simple: the latter Is a notational variant of (a subset of) the former.","By contrast, it ls not so easy to define and use the relation between a formal theory and the \"natural\" information. The theory mlght ignore some aspects, such as phonology, or etymology, wi)lle it would use \"semantic\" categories (such as COUNTABLE, TOOL, HUMAN, PERSONNIFIABLE, CONCRETE, ABSTRACT...) far more detailed than the \"natural\" ones (SOMEBODY, SOMETHING...).","In order for the construction of such FID to be possible, we must at least ask that all \"selective\" lnformatlon, which guides the choice of a meaning and of a translation, must In some sense be co~aon to the natural and the formal systems.","Hence, these systems must flare a certain degree of homogeneity. Dictionaries containing very llttle gral~attca] Information (e.g. only the class) cannot be used as skeletons For FIDs integrating the lexlcal data base of a (lextcally) sophisticated MT system.","Another problem is just how to express the relatlon between the systems, In such a way that it Is possible: to reconstruct (part of) the skeleton of an ttem from the \"coded\" information; to compute (part of) the formal information on a path of the skeleton.","For the time being, we can write ad hoc programs to perform these tasks, for a particular pair of systems, but we have no satisfactory way to \"declare\" the relation and to automatically generate programs from it. 2. TYPE OF UNDERLYING DATA-BASE SYSTEM","P.Vauquols (a son of B.Vauquols) and D.Bachut have implemented the above-mentioned mock-up in Prolog-CRISS, a dialect of Prolog which provides fac1lltles for tile manipulation of \"banks\" of clauses. It Is possible to represent directly the tree structure of an item by a (complex) term, making it easy to program the functions associated to a FID directly In Protog.","ttowever, Prolog Is not a DBMS, and, at least with tile current Implementations of Prolog, a large scale implementation Would be very experlstve to use (in terms of t 1me and space) , or perhaps even impossible to realize.","AS FIbs would certainly grow to at least 50000 items (perhaps to 200000 or more), it might be preferable to implement them Ina colm~erclally available DBMS system, such as DL1, SOCRATE, etc. A numeric simulation made by E. de goussineau shows that a (1--2) Fig of about 100000 len~mas CoUld be Implemented In a Socrate DB, of the network type, in one or two \"virtual spaces\". No experlment has yet been conducted to evaluate the fieasiblllty o£ tile method and its COSt.","Other possibilities include relational and specialized DBMS systems. In a relational DBMS, each Socrate entity would glve rise to a relatlon. Specla]lzed DBMS have been developed for terminological data banks, such as fERMIUM or EURODICAUTOM. There is a general tool for building terminological DB, ALEXIS (3~. 3. CHARACTER SETS","None of tile above--mentioned systems provides facllltles for handling multlllngua] character sets. Hence, all strings representing units of the considered natural languages, including the keys, must be represented by appropriate transcriptions.","Thls is clumsy for languages written In the Roman alphabet, and almost unacceptable for oilier languages, alphabetical or ideographlc. Supposing that bit-map terminals and printers are available, two solutions may be envisaged: define appropriate ASCII or EBCDIC transcriptions, and equip the DBMS wltll corresponding interfaces;"]},{"title":"426","paragraphs":["modify the BBMS itself to represent and handle several (possibly large) character sets. Thls ls what has been done in Japan, where progralrmleg langLlages, text processing systems and operating systems have been adapted to the 16-btt JIS (or JES) standard. CONC~ION","We have presented and illustrated the new concept of Fig, or Fork Integrated Dictionary, To our knowledge, this ts the first attempt to unify classical and MT dictionaries. However, only a small mock-up has been implemented, and some problems of design and Implementatl(in have been detected.
