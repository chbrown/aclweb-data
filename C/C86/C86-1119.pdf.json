The solution of such problems as anaphora, quantification, negation and so on, should be regarded as full right conclusions. The reason is that this purely linguistic information is necessary for obtaining the essential one, describing the external world under consideration.","The measure of quality of any discourse analysis system is the adequacy of its inference capabilities to those of human language users. This implies that any such a high quality system must provide some mechanism modelling common sense reasoning.","In everyday life we are continously forced to accept various conclusions which we are prepared to reject when our knowledge increases. The ability of drawing such cancellableinferences, beliefs in AI terminology, makes common sense reasoning nonmonotonic in the sense that the set of derivable conclusions does not increase monotonically with the set of premises, as in standard logics.","Earlier experiences have proved that ad hoc nonmonotonic tools were ineffective. They have seemed to work for the simplest cases only. Since they lacked theoretical founds[ions, their behaviour has been unclear in more complex situations.","Recently there have been a number of attempts to formalize various nonmonotonic mechanisms (see (iI, 1980), (AAAI, 1984[)).","In this paper we analyse the phenomenon of nonmonotonicity in a natural language. We also formulate a number of general principles which should be taken into account while specifying a discourse-oriented nonmonotonic formalism.","It is well recognized that ordering of discourse utterances is essential for its understanding~ On the other hand, logical systems lack mechanisms capturing this property. If follows, therefore~ that to model the dynamic nature of a discourse, some kind of struciuralization is needed. A very natural, both computationally and conceptually, discourse structuralization has been suggested by Kamp (Kamp, 1981).

Anaphora, as well as quantification or negation are purely surface phenomena. One must resolve ~them while processing a discourse, but their solutions lead to conclusions describing the discourse rather, than the external world under consideration. For this reason we shall refer £o those conclusions as surface conclusions. Presupposition, on the other hand, as well aS time line COnStruction, conditionals or various conversational rules, concerns conclusions describing directly the world being represented by a discourse. Vge shall refer to those conclusions as .~eneral conclusions.","Our purpose is not to review all the linguistic phenomena dealing with nonmonotonicity, but to demonstrate that (i) both kinds of conclusions are subject to","invalidation, (ii) canceliable conclusions of both types can","be supported either by semantic or pragmatic","sources.","This leads to an important observation that nonmonotonicity exists on various levels of discourse understanding, viewing both processing method and data to be processed. Surface conclusions","The following examples of pronoun anaphora and quantification show that semantic-based as well as progmatic-based surface conclusions can be invalidated.","Example i (pronoun anaphora)","(i) The Vice-President entered the President's","office. He was nervous and clutching his","briefcase."]},{"title":"504","paragraphs":["\"l~his example is from (Ascher, 1984). There are semantic reasons supporting the conclusion that the Vice-President is the one who is nervous given the information that he has a meeting with the President. \"I'his conclusion can be, however, overturned by adding (2) After all, he couldn't fire the Vice-President","without making trouble for himself with the","chairman of the board. Example 2 (pronoun anaphora)","(3) Peter' WaS sitting in a room. When John entered the room he seemed nervous. Although there are two possible referents of \"he\" in (3), it is pragmatically well motivated that \"he\" refers to \"Peter\", This follows from Gricels Cooperative Principle. Assuming that the speaker is obeying it, he should replace (5) by the unmistakable","(4) Peter was sitting in a room.

For each man there is a woman such that he loves her. Applying his \"ordering principles\", based on the observation that humans are used to handle information from left to right, IIintikka in (Ilintikka, 1977) convincingly suggests that (8) is pragmatically preferred reading for (6). Nevertheless, this conclusion may be overturned, lPor instance, it (6) is extended to (9) \"l~here are three men in a room. Every man","loves a woman. Her name is Melinda. Example 4: (quantification) (10) A rifle has been given to all soldiers, From among two possible readings of (10), the one asserting that different rifles have been given to different sotdiers should be semantic-ally preferred° But this interpretation is immediately inv~lidated when (10) is replaced by (11) A rifle has been given to all soldiers.","It has turned out to be broken. General conclusions","'l~he following examples of presupposition illustrate that semantic-based as well as pragmatic-based general conclusions are subject to cancellation.","(presupposition) (3.2) John regrets that he didn't win the prize. (12) presupposes that John did not winthe prize.

It exists on various levels of discourse analysis. It seems, therefore, that no high quality discourse under-standing system can i~nore this fact.","q?OWARDS A DI~SCOURSE-ORIEN'J?ED","NONMONOG)ONIC FORMALISM","Although a great number of various nonmonotonic (nm, for short) formalisms can be found in AI literature, none of them seems to be fully appropriate for the purpose of discourse under-standing. In our opinion, only default logic pare tially captures the expressive power of natural language. ]Deriving from Minsky's frame concept, this formalism has turned out to be useful for various natural language applications (see (Dunin- -K~plicz, 1984), (Mercer, Reiter, 1984).","Default logic has been introduced by Relier in (P.eiter, 1980) to model default reasonin_q, i.e., the drawing of plausible conclusions from incomplete information in the absence of evidence to the contrary, f typical example of default reasoning is the inference rule \"<Pypically birds fly\".

(see (Relier, 3_980) fop details)."]},{"title":"505","paragraphs":["Specifying a nm discourse-oriented formalism is a difficult problem. \"])he first step is to determine all its relevant properties. In this section we shall try to accomplish this point and to discuss some weaknesses of default logic in this respect.","The first problem is to choose an appropriate standard logic as a basis of the constructed system. Although the majority of existing nm formalisms are based on classical first-order logic, it is well recognized that to capture the structure of natural languages, at least intensional logic, preferable with tense operettors, is required. It should be, however, stressed that for computational reasons some compromise between adequacy and simplicity is necessary.","The next step is to add a nonmonotonic deductive structure to the chosen monotonic logic. This amounts to the following task. Given a the-err A, i.e., a set of formulae describing relevant information about a world, determine a set E(A) of conclusions nonmonotonically derivable from A. The general idea is to identify this set with the set of conclusions monotonically derivable from some extension of A. For this reasonlD(A) is called an extension of A, and is interpreted as the set of plausible conclusions about the world under consideration.","Defining a language and nm deductive structure, determines a nm system. But to make the system applicable for discourse processing, a number of additional factors should be taken into consideration.","~irst, a semantics mus[ be specified. In particular, a model regarded as a nm description of a real world under consideration should be defined.","Second, a method of determining whether a conclusion can be inferred from a given set of premises should be specified. Because nm deriv-ability depends not only on what can be proved, but also on what cannot be proved, there are technical problems involved here. In particular, even if the system is based on semi-decidable first-order logic, its proof theory is generally undecidable. \"])his means that some kind of heuristics is necessary, and the system will sometimes arrive at mistaken conclusions. Nevertheless, it is often sufficient to consider only models with finite domains limited to the individuals explicitely occurring in the discourse. In such a case, the logic we are dealing with is, in fact, the propositional one. \"I~he nm formalism based on propositional logic is, of course, decidable."]},{"title":"\"l~hird,","paragraphs":["belief___.~s [evision~ that is a method of reorganizing world model when new information leads to inconsistency should be specified.

In terms of extension, this means that such an extension should contain those discourse-connected conclusions which would be drawn by humans. In our opinion, none of existing nm formalisms fully captures this requirement. The detailed discussion of this hypothesis can be found in (Lukaszewicz, 1986).","In the majority of nm systems the notion of an extension is defined in a way admitting the existfence of many different extensions for a given theory, q~his poses the question of how to define the set of conclusions derivable from such a theory. 'l~here are two possibilities. First, to view each extension as an alternative set of beliefs one can hold about a world under consideration. In fact, this solution has been adopted in default logic. Second, to identify the set of conclusions with the intersection of all extensions. Both solutions are reasonable but have different interpretations, q~he first represents what an agent beliefs about a world, the second, wh~t an outside observer would know about the agent~ beliefs, given the set of the agent's premises about the world.","In our opinion, the second solution is better motivated in discourse processing, q~his follows from the fact that both the speaker' and the hearer try to achieve a common representation of a discourse. \"l~his would be impossible, if each of them accepted a different extension.
