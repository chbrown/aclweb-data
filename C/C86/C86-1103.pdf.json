Sources for entries and tools for constructing and maintaining the database are discussed, as well as the information needed in the lexicon for the purposes of syntactic and semantic processing."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The intent of this paper is to show some aspects of a computer dictionary geared towards the natural language component of an expert system. The dictionary is organized as a database to integrate tile various aspects of lexicographic work and, at the same time, enable fast access from a parser. Work on the lexicon was long neglected - both in theoretical linguistics and natural language processing projects - so we felt that a principled approach was overdue (cf. Sedelow (1985) for a survey of related work). In the past two years, we concentrated therefore on the formulation of criteria for establishing syntactic features which have to be coded in the lexicon, and we will report here on some of our findings. This will be preceded by a brief overview of the aims of our overall project and a short description of the prototype system we are building. We will then describe the design of our lexicographic database including the criteria for selecting sources of the vocabulary and some of our tools for editing and querying. The main objectives of the project Linguistics and Logic Based Legal Expert System, which is a Joint Research Project between the University of T/ibingen and the IBM Scientific Center Heidelberg, are to design and implement a natural language based knowledge acquisition and query system and to build a legal expert system on its basis. It consists of the following components: • The"]},{"title":"dialog component","paragraphs":["controls the interaction with users and contains among other things an"]},{"title":"explanation component","paragraphs":["and a component for preparing system output for display and for eventually generating natural language explanatory texts.

Within the scope of this project, it will be enhanced to suit the requirements of a natural language (German) based expert system. This means that it must be able to deal with both running texts and queries and to translate them into their corresponding logical form. The Natural Language Analyzer consists of the following parts: - a sentence separator splitting texts into sentences, • a pre-parser for dictionary look-up, . the parser and the routines for semantic analysis, • routines for the generation of the logical form from","intermediate structures (cf. Guenthner and Leh-","mann (1984) for a description), • routines for semi-automatic generation of thesaurus","extensions (Wirth, R. (1984)). As a specific application, the area of German traffic law was chosen for the expert system which shall be used in two modes: for consultation by a legal expert and as a tutor for law students (cf. Alschwee et al. (1985) for details)."]},{"title":"2 Description of the Dictionary","paragraphs":["Within such an environment, a fairly large-sized and detailed dictionary is needed. Aspects of its design, the structure in the database, and the editing and querying facilites will be discussed (cf. also Barnett (1985)). The expected size of the dictionary within the scope of the project is estimated to be some 20,000 entries. Its current size is some 12,000 entries. 435"]},{"title":"2.1 Word Database","paragraphs":["Because we must be able to handle a large number of words in this project, we felt that it would be necessary to administrate them in a more appropriate form than the usual file organization and that a relational database would be the best tool for dealing with lexical information because of the following advantages: • excerpting grammatical information according to speci-","fic features; • links to related information not necessarily kept in the","same table; • easier control of updates; • many types of integrity checks; • automatic backup so that, in case of a systems break-","down, a consistent status remains available; • another great advantage of database technology is con-","currency capabilities which preventusers working on the","same table from getting in each other's way.; • and, within the realm of this project, the possibility to","link to the Natural Language Analyzer."]},{"title":"2.2 Scope","paragraphs":["The scope of the information contained in our dictionary is geared towards the processing of natural language by computer. Lexical information must therefore be more detailed and more explicit than in standard dictionaries intended for humans. Also, a computer dictionary is of no value unless it matches the grammar and the needs of the semantic processing. We started with the coding of morphological and syntactic information, since we felt to be on rather stable ground there. We will report on some of the difficulties we encountered - many of them not unknown to theoretical linguistics"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["in the next section. Semantic information is coded primarily in the form of meaning rules, but we have not included these in our lexical database yet, as we are still experimenting with different kinds of information and representations before we go to large-scale coding. We also hope that, at least to some extent, the acquisition of such information can be automated (cf. the approach taken by Wirth (1984))."]},{"title":"2.3 Sources","paragraphs":["For the purpose of our particular application, we need to cover the vocabulary occurring in German traffic law. However, to meet the goal of general applicability, it is also necessary to include the core of the general German vocabulary. We will try therefore to code the relevant legal words based on texts from this very domain. In addition - and this is the greater problem - we must try to define which words pertain to the common vocabulary. As a first step, we have compiled a preliminary list of the 4000 most frequent German words from an existing frequency dictionary (Meier (1967)) and news texts. Later, we will make frequency counts of representative samples of texts to arrive at a more reliable list of words.","® IBM Germany has a dictionary of 70,000 entries containing morphological and hyphenation information. 436","• The vocabulary of the application area, i.e. from the legal domain, stems from the following sources: • A collection of relevant court decisions (from our","study partner), • A number of accident descriptions collected from","newspapers, • A few word lists used for document retrieval from","both the Legal and Public Relations departments of","IBM Germany.","• We plan to investigate to what extent machine-readable dictionaries or legal texts can be used for an automatic or semi-automatic acquisition of lexical and grammatical information and of common-sense knowledge."]},{"title":"2.4 Layout of the Dictionary Relation","paragraphs":["In our word database, every word constitutes an entry, and most columns in the entry contain information concerning a particular word. Even though semantic aspects are not coded in this particular version, one may regard the codes as a representation of a word's morphological and syntactic meaning. Some words have more than one entry: to code multiple entries becomes necessary when different grammatical feature sets have to be assigned to one lemma. All words are contained in a single table or relation. One could also envisage a separate table for every part of speech; however, this would be rather inconvenient, as it would be impossible to compare grammatical phenomena across different categories. Also it may be desirable to look at words of the same root but belonging to different parts of speech. With this necessity in mind, we designed an overall, general relation which would contain all words. In order to treat the words individually and according to their specific needs, a so-called \"view\" was defined for each part of speech. The present structure of the relation is described in Figure 1."]},{"title":"2.5 Tools and Aids","paragraphs":["To facilitate coding and to ensure its accuracy, we use the following tools: Editing: A Dictionary Editor (a menu-driven program running under ISPF (IBM 1982) interacting with the SQL/DS database) was developed to facilitate adding, updating, deleting, and checking of entries at the terminal. Under this editor, a specific set of menus and help panels was implemented for nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Whereas the main menus contain only short hints to the grammatical information as a sort of reminder to the lexicographer, help menus give more detailed examples for the individual codes. Subpanels, as extensions to the main panel for input, and error messages also assist the lexicographer. Codes arc verified by the Dictionary Editor to keep down the error rate."]},{"title":"Queries, Reports, and Files:","paragraphs":["Independently of the Dictionary Editor, the lexicographers work with the standard database interfaces ISQL (IBM 1983) and QMF (IBM 1983, 1984) to query, extract, recover, and to view the contents of the word database.

Here we include information on government (or valency) and on adverbials (or attributes) which serve to subclassify the various parts of speech. Our work is based on the work of Fillmore (1968), Gross (1984), Heidolph et al. (1980), Steini~ (1969), Bierwisch (1963), Helbig and Schenkel (1975), Sommerfeldt and Schreiber (1977, 1980), and on Zoeppritz (1984). For the practical work on a dictionary, it is of utmost im-portance to make fully explicit the criteria for the different classifications used. Such criteria are notoriously difficult to extract from theoretical as well as practice..oriented works. 3,1 Government German verbs can be classified according to the objects they govern (accusative (A), dative (D), genitive (G), prepositional object (P), predicate noun or adjective (N)). We decided to include also the subject (N) among the complements go.. verned by the verb. A similar classification can be carried out for adjectives (they govern cases as well as prepositions) and for nouns (which govern prepositional attributes; genitive attributes are not coded but admitted for every noun). While some of the complements may be missing in a sentence, others must be regarded as obligatory, and this must be coded in the dictionary as well. So we code two features indicating the maximum and the minimum of complements of a given word. This is illustrated by the adjective"]},{"title":"iiberlegen","paragraphs":["(superior) which gets the maximal code DP and the minimal","code ZZ (nil):","(D) (P) Paul ist uns im Weitsprung fiberlegen.","(Paul is superior to us in the long jump.) Paul ist im Weitsprung/iberlegen. Paul ist uns fiberlegen. Paul ist fiberlegen. There are a number of problems in determining what complements can be governed by a given verb. We will discuss here the problcm with datives, and in the section on adverbials we will discuss the problem of how to distinguish between adverbials and prepositional objects. 437 It was noted by case grammarians (but also to some extent in traditional grammar) that datives perform different functions (\"semantic roles\"), and that only some of them should be regarded as subeategorizing the class of verbs; the others are sometimes called \"free\" datives which are exemplified by"]},{"title":"ethical:","paragraphs":["Wirf mir die Vase nicht weg. (Be sure not to throw the vase away)"]},{"title":"possession:","paragraphs":["Paul brach mir den Arm. (Paul broke my arm)"]},{"title":"benefactive:","paragraphs":["Paul fibersetzte mir den Brief (Paul translated the letter for me)","responsibility: Die Vase ist mir zerbrochen. (The vase broke during the time I had it) (cf. also Heidolph et al. (1980) for a discussion and Wegener (1985)). Free datives are never obligatory, but all other criteria so far are only semantically motivated and are - particularly in the case of the benefactive - not very well defined. But still, free datives can be taken into account by the grammar and can thus be attached to any suitable verb. 3.2 Complement Clauses In accordance with Bierwisch (1963) and Heidolph et al. (1980), we consider complement clauses as filling the positions of nominal complements. The complement clauses we consider are daft (that) clauses, ob (whether) clauses, and infinitive clauses (pure infinitives and infinitive clauses introduced by zu (to)). Bierwisch was first in subcategorizing German verbs according to the implied subjects of the infinitive clauses they govern. Consider the following examples in English John permitted Paul to leave John persuaded Paul to leave This is problematic, however, with some verbs in German when the infinitive clause contains modal verbs. Consider Er flehte sie an zu gehen (he begged her to leave) with the implied subject sie, and Er flehte sie an, gehen zu dfirfen (He begged her to be permitted to leave) with the implied subject er. This shift of implied subject must be coded in the lexicon (for verbs like diirfen), so that the code can be used by the syntax rules for complex verbs. A second problem concerns cases where an implied subject cannot be found in the matrix clause as in Paul ordnete an, den Saal zu rfiumen (Paul ordered the room to be cleared) Es ist verboten, den Rasen zu betreten (it is forbidden to walk on the lawn) There are two different phenomena involved: The dative governed by verbieten, would be the implied subject, but 438 happens to be omitted, whereas anordnen does not govern a candidate for implied subject. If there is no suitable candidate in the context, we get a generic interpretation, and we code our complement features accordingly."]},{"title":"3.3 Adverbials","paragraphs":["Our approach to adverbials is closely related to the one taken by Steinitz (1969) and Heidolph et al. (1980), which - to us - seems far better motivated than e.g. the classification in Brockhaus Wahrig (1980-1984). Certain types of adverbials we consider to be governed by certain verbs, nouns and adjectives, and these are hence used for subcategorization. They include adverbials of"]},{"title":"place:","paragraphs":["Paul wohnt in Heidelberg (Paul lives in Heidelberg)"]},{"title":"direction:","paragraphs":["Paul geht nach Heidelberg (Paul goes to Heidelberg)","modality: Paul benimmt sich schlecht (Paul behaves badly)"]},{"title":"measure:","paragraphs":["der Vortrag dauert eine Stunde (the lecture lasts one hour) It has been our tendency to code adverbials only when they are obligatory, but this certainly does not cover all the information necessary. A further problem concerns the decision between adverbial and prepositional object.

Consider Paul stood on the table Paul insisted on the table In the first case, we could have near, under, by, etc. instead of on whereas in the second case, we do not have a choice. 3.4 Coding"]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["The following example shows the test questions and corresponding coding decisions for verbs and adjectives.

Wirth (1984) has described a procedure to extend a concept hierarchy and selection restrictions from text on the basis of given sentences. In his procedure, human intervention is still required, and it seems doubtful at this point whether a fully automatic procedure is feasible.

By November 1985, we coded morphological and syntactic information for some 5,500 nouns, approximately 3,000 verbs, and 3,500 adjectives. Our next steps are to fully integrate the lexical database with the rest of our prototype to improve our concordance programs, and to continue the development of criteria for syntactic subcategorization."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["We want to thank B.
