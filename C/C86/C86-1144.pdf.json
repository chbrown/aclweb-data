Introduction Research into text-to-speech systems has become a rather important topic in the areas of linguistics and phonetics. Particularly for English, several text-to-speech systems have been established (cf. for' example llertz (1982), Klatt (1976)). For Dutch, text-to-speech systems are being developed at the University of Nijmegen (cf. Wester (1984)) and at the Universities of Utrecht and Leyden and the Institute of Perception Research (IPO) Eindhoven as we]]. In this paper we will be concerned with the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion component as part of the Dutch text-to-speech system which is being developed in Utrecht, Leyden and Eindhoven.","One of our primary interests is that the grapheme-to-phoneme system not only has to generate the input for speech synthesis, either in allophone or diphone form, but that it had to be used for other"]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["urposes as well. Thus, the system has to satisfy the -ollowing demands: - its output must form a proper and flexible input for diphone as well as allophone synthesis; - it must be possible to easily generate phonematized lists on the basis of orthographic input; - it must be possib].e to automatically obtain information regarding the relation between graphemes and phonemes in texts; - the system has to be user-friendly, so that it can be addressed by linguists without computer training (for example to test their phonological rules).","In our view, there are two aspects to a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system: a linguistic and a computational one.

In the first module, 'difficult' elements like numbers, acronyms and abbreviations, have to be changed into their corresponding full graphemic notation. Next, one has to recover units from the spelling which influence grapheme-to-phoneme conversion: for example, words form-lag compounds are written as one uninterrupted string in Dutch, but have to be recovered because they influence graphemic conversion and stress assignment. The third and most important module concerns the rules which assign phonemes to graphemes. We then have phoneme information, and can establish further relevant units on the basis of this information. Finally, phonological processes have to be accounted for in modules for stress assignment and segmental phenomena."]},{"title":"I.i. Phoneme-to-grapheme assignment","paragraphs":["Our starting point for the development of the grapheme-to-phoneme system is that graphemes and phonemes are different entities, which should be represented at separate levels. As graphemes form the input for the conversion, the grapheme level is filled from the start. The derivation of phonemes is performed in the following way: to each grapheme or group of graphemes a corresponding phoneme is assigned at the phoneme level. This is represented in (i), where lower case letters indicate graphemes and capitals indicate phonemes."]},{"title":"612","paragraphs":["(]) grapheme level: a b c d e f g"]},{"title":"phonemelovel: f","paragraphs":["Notice that the assumption of two levels, one for graphemes and one for phonemes, makes it possible to obtain information about the relation between graphemes and phonemes. As we will see below this assumption has some other attractive consequences.","Notice furthermore, that to each grapheme or sequence of graphemes a phoneme has to be assigned, except in cases where there is no corresponding phoneme. For the non-linguist, it may come as a surprise that a great number of regularties and subregularities in correspondance between graphemes an([ phonemes can be found. The assignment of phonemes to graphemes is therefore (lone by rule. Of course, there are always words that cannot be captured by the rules: these will have to be enumerated. The order of application will then be enumeration, sub-rules and rules. The string of graphemes J s scanned sequentially: first a phoneme is assigned to the initial grapheme, then this is repented for the second grapheme and so on. This procedure works very quickly since, if the grapheme under consideration is all a, only the rules assigning phonemes to a will have to be considered. The rule format used here, is very similar to the well-known format of Chomsky and Halle (1968) (=SPE). Some further mechanisms are added to their rule format: - it is possible to negate elements or groups of elements in the environment of the rule; - one can use so-called global rules, referring hack to information avail.able earlier in the derivation because we use a two-level approach; - it is possible to use definitions instead ot repeatedly used sequences, in the rule environment, such as sequences indicating syllable boundaries.","Below, we will demonstrate how our linguistic knowledge can be expressed in rules and sub-rules. These rules will not cover all eases, but they will serve as an illustration, h rule completely written in the standard SPE format may be as follows.","(2) c,h -> SJ / i,n,{<-cons>} - {c } This rule assigns the phoneme SJ/[~] to the letters ch, if the latter is followed by the letters in followed by either a vowel or c, thus accounting for chinchilla (chinchilla) and China (China). As one can see from (2) no \"long\" braces are used to indicate several alternatives, but each alternative is surrounded by short braces, since it is impossible to use \"long\" braces in the computer. Furthermore, phonological features are surrounded by angled brackets.","The possibility of negating an element is illustrated in (3). (3) e,h -> SJ / i e,'l The grapheme preceded by a quote in (3) is negated. This means that every sequence consisting of ch preceded by i and followed by e which in turn may not he followed by i, is assigned the phoneme SJ. Thus we account for the alternation in ch-pronunciation ia fiche (chip) where ch is SJ and richel (sill) where ch is X/[x].","As a last example, a rule is given in which only phoneme information has a triggering effect. (4) au -> O0 / SJ To the graphemic sequence au the phoneme 00/[o:] is assigned if it is preceded by the phoneme SJ as is the case in chauvinisme (chauvinism) where ch is SJ. Notice furthermore, that one can only use phoneme information in the lefthand env:i.ronmenl: of rules assigning phonemes to graphemos, since the string is scanned from left to right and grapheme I/y gral)heme.","k further addJ lieu to the SPE format which has been developed is the possibility to require two th:ings at the same t:i.lne Jn the environment of rules: so-called coordinations. The ueed for such ai1 option is .i].]tlstrated by the following example.

Rul.e (6) is independently motivated by cases such as berg (mountain). Rule (5a) takes precedence over rule (Sb) an(l (Sb) over (6). This means that if (5a) has been applied both (5b) and (6) will not be applied, although the:Jr requirements are met.

The rules then must refer to morphological and/or syllable structure.","Syllable weight is decisive in stress assigament in monomorphemic words. For compounds, however, morphological structure has to be recognized. By making reference to sequences of vowels and consonants, the syllable weight call be defined. As is well-known from SPE, stress rules in monomorphemic words are disjunctively ordered (cf. (i0)). For our system, tile implication is that the whole input string (for these stress rules) has to be scanned for each sub-stress ruleo Furthermore, <-st(less)> has to be present as a feature of the vowels in tile righthaud environment of the rule. in most cases, compouud stress is assigned to the first word of the compound.

In these linguistic rules one is able to describe the phoneme-to-grapheme assignment J.n terms of graphemes, phonemes and their context. In principle, there are two basic possib:kl:kties to do so. Either one refers directly to a basic entity (e.g. grapheme or phoneme, in which case the structure has a fixed length) or one uses a larger structure that describes thee context ill a more complex manner. A basic entity can be referred to explicitly, by stating the gra-I)heme or phoneme involved, but also implicitly, by specifying some features to define a set of phonemes or graphemes for which the context is valid. As to tile structures, several are availaM.e. The first one 613 is alternative validity: one of the specified structures must be valid to produce a match (cf. rule (2)). The opposite structure is simultaneous validity: all of the specified structures must be valid to produce a match (cf. (5)). A third possibility is negated validity: when the structure is valid, no match will result and vice versa (cf. (3)). A fourth (commonly used) structure is optional validity: the specified structure may or may not be present (cf. (12)).","It will be clear that the system gains consider-ably in power by allowing combinations of these structures. For the implementation this has some non trivial consequences. First of all, a suitable data representation must be found to store the linguistic knowledge. It is desirable to have this representation in a compact and efficient form, as it will be consulted 'on-line' during the transcription process. Because there are no restrictions on the use of these structures, the use of a dynamic data structure to represent the knowledge seems appropriate in order to prevent too much a waste of memory seems obvious. This dynamic data structure consists of a variable number of linked units. Each unit consists of a number of ~fields' to represent the different types of information one needs. This is illustrated below. In the field type an indication is given of the type of information and its location. Next, there are four fields, one of which contains the linguistic information formulated in the rules. If the unit is a grapheme, the grapheme concerned is stored in tile field graph. As a phoneme is seen as a different entity, a phoneme will be represented in the next :field, denoted by phon. Then it is possible to use features to indicate a set of phonemes or graphemes. These are of two different types but are stored in the same fie:ld feat. This actually is a pointer to a list of features, containing the value (+ or -) and the feature concerned. The final information field contains a list of other units. This is needed to represent the alternative or simultaneous validity. Both of these structures are stored in this list, and in combination with the first field containing the type, the system knows how to interpret this list. The optional validity can be seen as an alternative validity: either the structure is present or not, and this is therefore represented as an alternative validity. Finally certain types do not contain any information, but are used as markers, i.e. negation and end negation which denote the beginning and end of a negated structure. Following these information fields, a last field next will refer to a following unit, which describes tile next part in the linguistic rule. As an example of how this data structure represents linguistic rules, the lefthand context of rule (8) is shown in (15). Since the focus is the starting point, the data structure is constructed from right to left. (I5) An input string will now be transcribed by comparing it with the appropriate units. While consulting this 614 data structure an unexpected problem arises. Because of the freedom the user has to combine different structures, it is possible to build a structure which has different lengths (number of units) :[or different paths. The unit or structure following this variable length structure no longer has a fixed position with regard to the starting point. This may especially create problems when this first structure is negated as well. This can be explained best with an example which is hypothetical. The structure, however, could easily be used by a linguist and thus the system should be able to handle it correctly. Suppose the right context of a linguistic rule looks as follows.","(16) '{a ),t - {o,u) The rule states that it is not permfltted that either an a, or an o fo].lowed by an u, is present before a t. The question is what exactly js meanL with this negatfion. A negation is only meaningful within a closed set, and therefore the set is defined implicit].y by the unit or structure being negated. 'a (not: a) means: all graphemes except a. '[o,u] means: all sequences of two graphemes except the sequence ou. The sequence at will therefore belong to this second set. If the input string now consists of att, the first path will reject the string, but the second path will approve of it. As both paths must approve of the string to produce a match, this string will be rejected. However, it is insufficient only to look at the negated part (and then when no match is detected, consult the positive part). An input string art would then be rejected on account of the leading a, which would be incorrect. As there is not t directly foil.owing the a, the first path can give no verdict on the string and should pass it to the second path which would approve Jr. It is therefore necessary to consider all paths in combination with all following units. For further discussion of this particul.ar problem, we refer to Van Leeuwen et al. (1986). 3. Concluding Remarks in this paper we have dealt with the system for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in Dutch as it is being developed at the Universities of Utrecht and Leyden and IPO, Eindhoven. We have shown that knowledge about spelling and phonology provides a proper grammar :[or automatic phoneme-to-grapheme assignment and that linguistic rules can be implemented without ad hoc mechanisms. Speed was considered an important performance feature in constructing the database as well as in consulting it. Typical values are: 20 seconds to (re)construct a new database (for instance for testing new rules or new versions of rules), and same 25 graphelne-to phoneme canversions per second. This phoneme-to-grapheme assignment system has been linked to the diphone speech synthesis system that has been developed at IPO. At the moment, the system is being tested on a lexicon of about 4000 monomorphemie words. References","CHOMSKY, N. AND N. HALLE (1968), The Sound Pattern of English.
