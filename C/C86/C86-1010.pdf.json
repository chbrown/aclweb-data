FR 5-8 Franklinstr. 28/29 D-IO00 Berlin 10 Germany - West Berlin","This paper builds upon and extends certain ideas developed within the framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG). ill A new descriptive device, the Category Cooccurrence Restriction (CCR), is introduced in analogy to existing devices of GPSG in order to express constraints on the cooccurrence of categories within local trees (i.e. trees of depth one) which at present are stated with Immediate Dominance (ID) rules and metarules. In addition to providing a uniform format for the statement of such constraints, CCRs permit generalizations to be expressed which presently cannot be captured in GPSG.","Sections l.l and 1.2 introduce CCRs and presuppose only a general familiarity with GPSG. The ideas do not depend on details of GPSG and can be applied to other grammatical formalisms.","Sections 1.3 - 1.5 discuss CCRs in relation to particular principles of GPSG and ass~ne familiarity with Gazdar et al. (].985) (henceforth abbreviated 'GKPS'). Finally, section 2 contains proposals for using CCRs to avoid the analyses with metarules given for English in GKPS. 1. Category Cooecurrence Restrictions (CCRs) I,i The Principle of CCRs","The reasons for proposing CCRs to state restrictions on the eooccurrence of categories within local trees are analogous to those for introducing Inmlediate Dominance (ID) and Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (of GEPS, pp. 44-50). A context free rule binds information of two sorts in a single statement, namely","(a) information about which daughters a rook has","in a local tree and","(b) information about the order in which the","daughters appear. By separating this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort \"A preceeds B in every local tree which contains both as daughters,\" which cannot be captured in a context free grammar (CFG).","Now consider an ID rule such as the following: (i) S --> A, B, C The fundmnental motivation for CCRs rests on the insight that such an ID rule itself combines two different kinds of information in a single statement, namely","(a) information involving immediate dominance","relations, here that <S, A>~ <S, B>, and","<S, C> are ordered pairs of categories in","which the first category inmlediately dominates","the second and","(b) information about the cooccurrence of","categories in a single local tree. By distinguishing and separately representing these types of information it becomes possible to state generalizations of the following sort, which cannot be captured in the ID/LP format:","(2) Any local tree with S as its root must have A as a daughter."]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["No local tree with C as a daughter also has D as a daughter.

The definition of branches is permissive in the sense in which ID rules are permissive (cf GKPS, p. 76): branches with a conmmn mother can be adjoined to form a local tree. CCRs, like the LP rules, which also apply to local trees, are restrictive and limit the class of local trees admitted by the grammar. [4] How sets of ID rules may be reformulated in this manner will be illustrated in the following section. 1.2 Examples of CCRs","GKPS (pp. 47-49) exm, ines sets of simple context free rules and then proposes strongly equivalent descriptions in ID/LP format. One set of ID rules resulting from this reformulation is given in (7):","(7) S -> NP, VP VP -~ V, VP S -> AUX, NP, VP VP ~> V, NP VP -> AUE, VP VP -> V, NP, VP The ID rules of (7) admit local trees whose brancbes are among the following:","(8) <S, NP>, <S, VP>, <S, AUX>, <VP, V>, <VP, VP>, <VP, AUR>, <VP, NP> Since none of the local trees admitted by (7) has more than one occurrence of a given category as daughter, we may say that the gran~ar first admits any strictly linearly ordered set [5] of branches","[3] If categories are assumed to be atomic (e.g. S, NP, V) rather than complex for the moment, then it is unnecessary to mention more than one root category in a given CCR,","[4] Note that the distinction of permissive vs. restrictive statements is closely related to that of inherited vs. instontioted feature specifications in the feature instantiation principles of GPSG. The theory would appear to gain in simplicity if a way could be found to eliminate these distinctions. [5] In order to simplify the present exposition, that share a conmmn mother as a local tree. This set of local trees must then be filtered with appropriate CURs so as to characterize the same set of local trees admitted by (7).","A single CCR covers the trees with S as root:"]},{"title":"(9)","paragraphs":["CCR 1: S ][ NP ̂VP ]l CUR 1 states that NP and VP are obligatory in any local tree with S as its root.

In particular, any local tree with AUX as daughter - regardless of its root - must have a VP as sister, so CCR 3 may be restated as two simpler CCRs, CCR 2' and CCR 4', where CCR 2' does not depend on the root category. Furthermore, CCR 4 can be rewritten as CCR 5' since V cannot be a daughter of S. The following final set of CCRs thus emerges:","(16) COR I': S ][ NP A VP ]] CCR 2': ][ AUX ~ VP ][ CCR 3': VP ][ AUX e ~Y ]] CCR 4': VP l[ AU× D,--NP ]l CCR 5': ][ V m (VP v NP) ]]","It may first appear that the description with CCRs in (8) and (16) constitutes no clear gain over the ID rules of (7). The latter, however, are highly redundant and express none of the generalizations achieved in (16). Furthermore, the replacement of ID rules with CCRs is the essential prerequisite for the elimination of metarules described in section 2. ].3 The Complement-Type Principle","The ~ttempt to replace all ID rules with individual CCRs would lead to very complicated descriptions. Fortunately, the idea of CCRs can be utilized in a general principle that replaces all .lexJca] ID rules (i.e. those which have a head that is an extension of a SUBCAT category; cf GKPS, p. 54), so that only nonleA'ical ID rules need be explicitly reformulated with individual CCRs.","Shieber (1983) and Pollard (1985) have proposed that a list- or stack-valued feature (SYNCAT or SUBCAT) be introduced whose value contains the complements of a head category. This paper uses TYP as a syntactic feature with a semantically oriented and lexJcally determined semantic type as its value. Following the convention of GKPS (p. 189), '<~, B>' will be written for <TYP(~), TYP(~)> where ~ and are categories. Given the structure of complex types in GKPS as single-valued functions, the types may be viewed as lists or stacks.","A Complement-Type Principle (CTP) can now be stated which has the form of a schematic CCR with conditions on variables: (]7) (a)]IX[BAR 0, +H, TYP <6 I, <...<Sn_ l, 5n>...>>] ]1 X[TYP 5n]","(b) [IX[BAR 0, +H, TYP <61, <...<6n_l, 6n>...>> ]","X[TYP 51] .̂.. X̂[TYP 5n_l]̂~X[TYP 6'] ]I where (i) 5' ~ {61 ..... 5n_ l} ; (it) the mother X[TYP 6n] and head daughter X[BAR 0, +HI are both ~[CONJ] ; [6] (iii) (a) and (b) are simultaneously fulfilled for a given assignment of types to 51, .... 5n_l, 6 n for 1 < n. CTP allows the complements of a head category to be read off from its semantic type if its mother is known. According to CTP the lexical head category V[SUBCAT 46] with type <VP[-AUX, BSE], <NP, S>> for the verb do has complement sisters VP[-AUX, BSE] and NP if its mother is S but has just the complement VP[-AUX, BSE] if its mother is VP, which has the type <NP, S>. The use of CTP in dealing with metarules will be shown in section 2 below, but first another general aspect of the metarule problem must be discussed. 1.4 Metaru]es and Lexical Rules","GKPS introduces not only metarules, e.g. the Passive Metarule (p. 59) and the Extraposition Metarule (p. 118), but also related lexical rules involving the same phenomena, e.g. the Lexieal Rule for Passive Forms (p. 219) and the Lexical Rule for Extraposition Verbs (p. 222). The lexJeal rules are not fully formalized but all state roughly that if a given lexeme has a certain category, translation, and semantic type, then a particular form of the lexeme has a corresponding category, translation, and type. Since lexieal rules do most of the work, and given that metarules apply only to Je_vSeaJ ID rules, it is unclear why both should be needed for what is essentially one job. [7]","CTP in fact allows the reduction of both devices, metarules and lexical rules, to one, here termed 'metalexical' (ML) rules. The latter are schematic rules of the form s =& ~, where a and 8 are category schemata which may contain variables in feature values. Ignoring the semantic translations of lexemes for the present, a ML rule states that if the lexicon con£ains an entry assigning ~ to lexeme w, then it also contains an entry assigning ~ to w; morphological rules determine the particular word form of w on the basis of syntactic features in the category. ML rules thus provide for an inductive definition of the lexicon. They handle not only phenomena like passive and extraposJtion but also, e.g. the subcategorization of sdng with or without an indirect object:, transitive or intransitive, etc. Examples follow in section 2, but next the entire formalism should be briefly summarized.","[6] The restriction that both categories be ~[CONJ] (i.e. unspecified for CONJ) is necessary for coordination. In the structural analysis of bought and read books NP is the complement of the V dominating bought and read but not of the V dominating read.","[7] Uszkoreit (1984, p. 65) has already expressed a similar view. 52 1.5 Sunmlary of the Formalism","The syntactic formalism proposed here proceeds by describing items (feature names and values, feature specifications, categories, and trees) with statements restricting the distribution of lowerlevel items within next-higher-level items. Feature nantes and atomic values are primitives. Complex feature values are categories or semantic types. A feature specification is an ordered pair <f, v> containing a feature nmne f and value v, where the latter is restricted by the feature-value rmlge of the former, h category is a set of feature specifications such that no feature name is assigned more than one value; it is legal iff it fulfills all Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions. h local tree is an ordered pair consisting of a legal root category and a list of legal daughter categories such that (a) the Complmnent-Type Principle, (b) tile Category Cooecurrence Restrictions, and (c) tile Feature Instmltiation Principles (i.e., respectively, lexical, nonlexical, and universal statements in the form of CCRs) as well as tile Linear Precedence statements are fulfilled. [8] A tree is an ordered pair consisting of a legal root category and a list of daughters, where each dau~,ter is either a tree or a word form. Word forms and their lexieal categories are specified by tile lexicon, defined by a list of basic lexical entries and metalexical rules.","The gramlmar defines two binary relations over categories, ID and LP (the latter constitutiag the Linear Precedence statements). A binary relation R ~ is the extensional closure of R iff for each <~, g> in R, R ~ toni:sins every <y, 6> such that y and 6 are extensions (oF GKPS, p. 27) of ~ and 6, respectively. A local tree with root C and daughters C~, ..., C","•",".",".o","~","n must fulfill him condltlons that <C , C.~ E ID= for 1 < i < n and <C., C.> ~ LP E+ (i.e? t~e transitive","%- 1 . extensional elo~ure of LP) where 1 < 1 < n-1 and j = i+l.","The proposed formalism utilizes more restricted memm tilmt GPSG but offers greater possibilities for expressing generalizations. The el iminat :ion of metarules and the introduction of CCRs give it a taore Ii~uogeneous struct:are and place cooccurrence restrictions of various kinds in the center of attention.","For the present it may be best to regard this formalism as a particular variant of GPSG since most of tile central notions of the latter are retained. All that is sought is a simplification of GPSG as described in GKPS. Given the ricll palette of formal.tams recently proposed for kinds of unification gra~mlar~ it seems rather ingenuous to create a new name for thin modification of GPSG, as though tile multitude of remaining open questions were thereby answered. What we need is a metaformalism that will relate the insights of all the current formalisms through formal invariants preserved under translation from one formalism to another, and that will then truly deserve a name of its own.","[8] The assmnption here is that any work done by tile Feature Specification Defaults (FSDs) of GKPS can be accomplished with suitably defined FCRs and CC~s. This will he illustrated in section 2 hut cannot be shown in general in this paper. 2. The Elimination of Metarules 2.1 General Remarks","GKPS allows metarules to be used in ways that intuitively seem undesirable. For example, a metarule may simply indicate that. a daughter h of S is optional : (lS) ( s -> w, h ) -~ ( s--~ w ) The metarule is superfluous if A is enclesed in parentheses in tile corresponding ID rules:","(19) S --> (A), B, C S --> (A), B, D Single optional elements in the RHS of ID rules are permitted but have no theoretical status.
