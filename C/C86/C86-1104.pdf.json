The Data","The S'hakespgare Dt'citbnar~/ (SHAD) project has been using structured databases since 1983. The system is implemented on a PRIME 250-II computer using standard CODASYL--DBMS software and related tools. The project has been able to draw on a vast repository of computerized material dealing with Shakespeare and the English lexicon. Initially, it was part of the \"Sonderforschungsbereich I00 Elektronische Sprachforschung\" sponsored on the national level by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The research team has been directed by Marvin Spevack and H. Joachim Neuhaus, now both at Miinster, and Thomas Finkenstaedt, now at Augsburg. Spevack's O'oraplete and Syateraah'c ~oncordanoe to the Works o/ ,~hakospeare (Hildesheim and New York, 1968-1978) and Finkenstaedt's Ohronalogt~al En]h)h Dichonarj/ (Heidelberg, 1970), both in machine readable form, were used in a computer-assisted lemmatization procedure (Spevack, Neuhaus, and Finkenstaedt 1974).","A chronologically arranged dictionary, where entries are sorted according to the year of first occurrence, makes it possible to \"stop\" the development of the recorded English vocabulary at any desired moment and to compare, for instance, Shakespeare's vocabulary with the corpus of English words recorded up to"]},{"title":"1623,","paragraphs":["when the F, ist Fohb appeared (Neuhaus 1978). The set of words in Shakespeare can be compared with the complement set of words available in Elizabethan English, but not attested in Shakespeare's works. In this way there is a systematic integration into the total vocabulary. As a result, our database model can easily be expanded or transfered to cover larger or different vocabularies.","In order to present the complete Shakespearean vocabulary and to disengage SHAD from dependence on a single edition of Shakespeare, the data were expanded to include all :Jtage directions and speech-prefixes in all quartos up to and including the F,'r,,t Foho (Volume VII of the ~omple~e and o°yaJ!emait~ Ctoncordance to the Works o/ S'hakesI, eare ), and the \"bad\" quartos (Volume VIII). Volume IX presents all substantive variants, producing a composite Shakespearean vocabulary in modern and eventually old spelling.","In analysing this material a strict differentiation between vocabulary level and text level has been observed. Further data-preparation on the vocabulary level concentrated on formal properties of Shakespearean lemmata, such as morphological structure, or etymological background. There is a complete morphology for all lemmata (ca. 20,000 records), which gives detailed structural descriptions of derivations, compounds, and other combinations, as well as all inflected word-forms, as they occur in the text. The etymological data include word histories and loan relations, again supplemented by chronological data. Content-oriented criteria were used in a taxonomic classification of all lemmata (Spevack 1977). On the whole, there are more than thirty fields of information in the original lemma-record file. For the multidimensional analysis and presentation of these resources it seemed natural to use database concepts.","Due to a special intervention of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the support of the Ministry, which we both gratefully acknowledge, we could implement our first database in 1983 on a newly installed PRIME 250-II computer. The PRIME DBMS software, which we use, is actually one of the first commercial products which closely adhered to the CODASYL network data model. The design started with a database schema for Shakespearean word-formation and etymology. Since then the system has grown steadily including now a thesaurus structure and a link to the text itself. The database is accessed in batch mode u:~zing the FORTRAN and COBOL interfaces, and interactively with the VISTA query language and report generator. Of course, in a first implementation not only the database schema itself, but the preparation of files, and the programming of the database creation job have to be carried out. The first word-formation database was established in three separate steps. The total time needed to complete the job was about 17 hours. Physical design is especially important in large databases. Our Miinster team was interested in that aspect from the very beginning (DSge 1984). 2. Prelirainary Design Considerations","Linguists and lexicographers are latecomers to the field of database applications. Database software has been available since the early 1960's. The early 1970's brought a wide variety of commercial products and a consolidation on the conceptual side, which ultimately led to standardization, design philosophies, and specifications of \"normal forms\". At that time lexicographers still used the concept of an archive when talking about new technologies, such as Barnart (1973), Chapman (1973), and Lehmann (1973) at the 1972 International Oon/grence on Le$1~ojzraphy in EnC/tsh. Similarly, in the late 1970'% we witnessed preparations for a Stanford Computer Archive of Language Materials. There is nothing wrong with the idea of an archive. But a database is 441 something different. By now, the expression \"database\" should only be used as a technical term. Perhaps \"data bank\" may be used instead of \"database\" when talking about files of data, or archives in a conventional sense. The As~oosal:an /or lh'terary and .L:nym'~hv Oorayult'ny may have had this clarification in mind when naming its specialist group \"Structured Data Bases\".","Although hierarchical data models and network models had been available since the early 1960s, and relational architectures since the early 1970s (Codd 1970), software implementations were not generally accessible in university computing eentres due to high cost, and lack of special support. Although the Mfinster computing centre had the hierarchical IMS software, a product of IBM, it was not made available for our project. Looking back from today, that may not have been a handicap for at least two reasons: lexical relationships are only rarely hierarchical in a natural sense, and, more importantly, hierarchical systems do not have a common standard. There is no migration path from one software product to another. Since a Shakespeare database will have a rather long life cycle, and was meant to be a model for similar projects, the requirement of a standard model seemed to be imperative. The process of standardization has been proceeding more rapidly for the CODASYL network model than for any other architecture. In the early 1980s there was just this model that fulfilled our requirements, and this is basically true even today.","Beginning with the early 1980'$ lexical symposia and conferences had an ample share of papers reporting on ongoin/~ research which used the database concept in a variety of ways. In 1981 Na~ao et al. reported on \"An Attempt to Computerize Dictionary Data Bases\" (198~). At the same conference a University of Bonn group (Brustkern and Hess 1982) presented \"The BonnIex Lexicon System\", which two years later evolved into a \"Cumulated Word Data Base for the German Language\" [Brustkern and Schulze 1983). A list of similar projects could easily be extended. One might have expected that the logical design of lexical databases would have built on structural ~ where we typically find entities and relationships, and in general, set theoretic notions, which can directly be translated into conceptual data-structures.","Surprisingly, in many designs, linguistic considerations did not seem to have played a major role. Instead, the authors simulate conventional lay-out and typesetting arrangements of printed dictionaries. An example is the widespread dictionary usage to print one \"Headword\" in bold type and then use special symbols, such as the tilde, to refer to the headword, or parts of it, thus saving space for the treatment of further lexical items with the same spelling. Nagao et al. (1982} very faithfully transfered this and other lay-out details into their design. But should a conventional \"Headword\" and its dependencies be a serious candidate for a database entity? Are the reasons that led dictionary publishers to accept certain lay-out techniques at all relevant for an electronic database? These questions seem not to have been raised. The design seems to have 442"]},{"title":"SYSTBM I System-to-Morpheme System-to-Ailomorph_","paragraphs":["_ ["]},{"title":"Morpheme-to-Aliomorph .....

Data-Structure for Morphological Families ( SHAD, database fragment} become a paradigm case of an imitation design, where a new technology replicates design features of an older technology. The basic misunderstanding is the false identification of a mere presentation in a printed dictionary with an underlying lexical information structure.","If the \"Headword\" is not a relevant database entity, which entity should be taken instead? There is only one serious candidate: the lemma. The lemma is a well defined linguistic notion. It is also weI[ known in computational work due to various automatic or semi-automatic lemmatization algorithms. It is an abstract notion in the sense that printed dictionaries and database systems need a lemma-name to refer to it. Language specific conventions usually govern the choice of a lemma-name. Latin verbs, for example, are customarily lemmatized using the first person singular present form as lamina-name. A [emma is the set of all its inflected word-forms. It thus comprises a complete inflectional paradigm. Some lemmata have defective paradigms or suppletive paradigms. Conventional dictionaries quite often include paradigmatic information in their front matter. The user has to relate specific cases to these examples. A database can relate these explicitly. A natural way to do this is by a one-to-many relationship between lemma and word-form. In an author dictionary word-forms will be further related to the text, and its internal structure.","A machine-readable dictionary is just a starting point for a structured lexical database. [n the Bonn \"Word Data Base for the German Language\" (Brustkern and Schulze 1983b} there is but one database entity, \"Lexical Entry\", which seems to correspond to the lemma rather than to a \"Headword\". The authors speak about the \"microstructure\" and the \"macrostructure\" in respect to \"Lexical Entries\", but only the former is discussed in detail. The later is only mentioned once: \"Special characteristics of the macrostructure (other than alphabetical order} are to be made explicit in the logical structure of the data base\" (Brustkern and Schulze 1983b}. \"Macrostructure\" is rarely visible in a conventional alphabetic dictionary, although we are used to \"synonyms\" and \"antonyms\", dictionary \"senses\", and labels that identify technical jargon, or special terminologies in individual dictionary entries. In the design of a lexical database it is useful to make these various relations between lemmata explicit. In this manner a user gets more information than by consulting a printed dictionary. The information he gets is related and structured in unexpected ways. 3. A Sample Schema","There are various ways to approach the problem of schema design.
