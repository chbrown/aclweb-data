We have solved this problem by applying an algorithm for bottom-up parsing, 1. Introduction which tile ends terminate at different portions on the phonetic sequence, and the other represents the sequences of syntactic categories (called category sequences), each of which is associated with one of the word strings, ln this situation, the controller chooses the word string with tile highest score, sends tile associated category sequence to the word predictor and asks it to predict those syntactic categories which can syntactically follow the selected sequence.","In this paper we present a method for converting a task-specific gravmnar into a word predictor, an important component of a speech understanding system. A context free grammar (CFG) or an augmented transition network grammar (ATNG) have been used to describe task-speclfic constraint. When a CFG is used, Early's algorithm[l], one of the most efficient top-down parsing algorithms, has been used to make word prediction[2]. When an ATNG is used, word prediction is simply made by tentatively traveling along arcs going out freln a state in an ATNG[3],[4],[5]. Since the word prediction is a top-down operation, it is difficult to avoid falling into an infinite loop if the task-specific grammar includes a left recurslve rule.","F. Perelra and D. Warren have developed a definite clause grammar (DCG)[6]. The rules described in a DCG are directly converted into a set of Pro]og clauses, which works as a parser with an aid of tile powerful pattern matching mechanism of Prolog. Thus syntactic analysis can be done without writing a specia] parser working on the rules of the grammar. Since tile syntactic analysis based on a DCG parser also works in top-down fashion, it shares the same difficulty as the top-down parsers have. ¥. Matsumoto et at. have developed a method for converting a set of rules described in a DCG into a bottom-up parser which has overcome thls difficulty without any loss of the advantages of a DCG[7].

It is, however, inefficient to analyze the given sequence whenever asked to predict. In fact, each node of the category tree is associated with a parsing history on how rules of the grammar have been applied to analyze the category sequence. The word predictor receives a node and its parsing history from the controller and predicts the syntactic cate~ gories following the node.","3_. The bottom-up parser and its application to word prediction","We give a brief explanatlon of the bottom-up parser proposed by Y. Matsumoto etal. Assume simply that the rules of the grammar are described in a CFG. Then, without loss of generality each of the rules can be expressed as either of the followings. c -> Cl,C2,..,c n (c, c i (i=l .... n): nonterminals) l) c -> w (w: a terminal) 2)","(l) These rules are transformed into the following Prolog clauses. cI(G,XI,X ) :- link(c,G),goal(c2,Xi,X2) .... goal(cn,Xn_l,Xn), c(G,Xn, X). l') dict(c,[wJX],X). ?') X and X~ (i=l .... n) are arguments to denote word strifig to be analyzed as a list. 'link(C,G) is a predicate to express that a string of which the left most symbol is a nonterminal C can be reduced to a nonterminal G. G is called a goal argument in this sense. 'link' is defined as follows: if the rule I) is included in the grammar, then 'link(cl,c)' holds, and if 'link(a,b)' and 'link(b,c)' &old, then 'link(a,c)' holds (transitive law), and 'link(c,c)' holds for every nonterminal c (reflective law). A predicate 'dict(C,X,Y)', searching the dictionary for the first word of a word string X, unifies C with its syntactic category and Y with the remaining string.","(2) A predicate goal(G,X,Z) is defined as follows.","goal(G,X,Z) :- dict(C,X,Y),link(C,G), exec(C,G,Y,Z). 3) where 'exec' is a predicate to execute a predicate 'c(G,Y,Z)'.","(3) Furthermore, fGr any nonterminal C, the following assertion called a terminal condition holds: c(c,X,X). 4) The parser for the given grammar consists of all these Prolog clauses.","In order to use the bottom-up parser as a left-to-right word predictor, we change the predicate 'goal' as follows:","goal(G,[],[]) :- llnk(C,G),terminal(C), output(C),fai}. 3'-I)"]},{"title":"606","paragraphs":["goal(G,X,Z) :- dict(C,X,Y),link(C,G), exec(C,G,Y,Z)."]},{"title":"3'-2)","paragraphs":["where 'terminal(C)' is a predicate to be true when a nonterminal C appears in the left-hand side of a productlonof 2).","The modified parser, receiving a word string from the controller, executes the second of 'goal' clauses in which the second argument X is unified with the given word string. Syntactic analysis of X is continued until X becomes empty. Then, the first of 'goal' clauses is invoked and predicts all the syntactic categories which make both 'link(C,G)' and 'terminal(C)' hold. 4.

Conclusions","In this paper we have proposed the procedure to convert a grammar defined in a CFG or a DCG into a Prolog program which functions as a word predictor. The procedure is give@ for the left-to-right control, but it is not difficult to expand it for the islanddriven control.","To simplify the description, we have given the conversion procedure for a grammar defined in a CFG, but it is easy to expand it for a grammar defined in a DCG, As long as one concernes on a speech understanding system in which syntax and semantics are well defined, one could take an advantage of a DCG in which a nonterminal can have some arguments as parameters, and could use semantic restrictions effectively to interpret an utterance. In developing a speech understanding system of which the task is to access a database, we use semantic markers to describe semantic restrictions between an adjective and a noun, a noun phrase and a postposition (in Japanese), and case slots of a verb and its fillers. In this case a rule can be expressed as follows: C(So) -> [Po(So, SI)}CI(SI){PI(SI,S2)}C2(S2)... {Pn_l(Sn_l,Sn))Cn(Sn), where S~ (i=O,l .... n) is a list of semantic markers, Pi (i=l,2 .... n) is a predicate to denote a constraint among semantic markers. Considering a transition network for this DCG rule, we associate P. with its","] i-th state and let Pi function as a converter of semantic markers. Since Pi would be defined in the form of a table, this converter could work bidirectionally. In addition, stacking a pair\" of a syntactic goal variable and a list of semantic markers in the parsing history, we can develop a procedure to transform a grammar described in a DCG into a word predictor.
