However, not only the ambiguity but also the vagueness which every natural language inevitably has leads this approach into essential difficulties. In contrast, our project, the Mu-project, adopts the transfer approach as the basic framework of MT. This paper describes the detailed construction of the transfer phase of our system from Japanese to English, and gives some examples of problems which seem difficult to treat in the interlJngual approach. The basic design principles of the transfer phase of our system have already been mentioned in (i) (2).

Construction of the Transfer Phase","paragraphs":["Analysis results 'of input sentences of the source language (SL) are represented in the form of annotated tree structures, from which one can retrieve various levels of information contained in the input sentences. The MTP is performed recursively from the top of the tree to the bottom (Fig. 2). At each step of the recursion, the sub-structure governed by a node (current node, node X ira Fig. 2) is transferr(~d to the corresponding structure of the target language (TL). This phase mainly performs lexJcal tran~'{fer, that is, it chooses an appropriate target lexical item for node X by examining the annotation parts of that node and its dependent nodes (nodes YI,..Y2,..Yn). The selection of a target lexical item may place certain constrains on the transfer of the dependent nodes. These constrains are expressed as property-value pairs and added to the annotation parts of the dependent nodes, which are to be utilized in the subsequent recursion steps. For language pairs such as Japanese and English which belong to quite different language families, however, the lexical transfer is not so straightforward. It often happens that single lexical items of SL correspond to complex (-~xpressions of TL and vice versa. Furthermore, certain structural changes are also required. Because the MTP recursively transfers sub-structures governed by single nodes, certain global structural differences cannot be naturally treated. Such global changes are deal t with by the Pre-TP and Pest-TP sub-phases (See section 7) . ?"]},{"title":"Fig. 2.

(2) Rules in the case when the deep case relation is not uniquely determined in the analysis phase : They determine the preposition just by referring to the surface case marker of Japanese.

The above two categories of rules are just rough c]assificat[ons and, in reality, more detailed rules are prepared for each Japanese case marker. In particular, there are several type 2 rules for each surface case marker which take into account the set of possible case interpretations given by the analysis phase.

The form-oriented dictionaries are provided just for preparing dictionary descriptions for a large number of ordinary lexica] J terns. The forms given in the preceding sections are used by lexicographers who do not have any detail ed knowledge about the transfer grammar. At execution time, these descriptions are expanded into GRADE lexica] rules (Fig. ll). If one wants to specify complicated transfer rules which cannot be expressed in these forms, one can provide ]exica] rules directly i n GRADE, and attach them to specific lexica], items. Such lexica] rules are also invoked at the appropriate time during tha transfer phase. The rules in the transfer grammar checks whether the ]exical items have ]exJca] rules of certain types, and if they have, the ]exical rules are i nvoked whether they are derived from the form-oriented dictionaries or prepared directly in the GRADE form. On<! can specify arbitrary tree-transformations in GRADE so that one can prepare very flexible transfer rules specific to ]exica] items.
