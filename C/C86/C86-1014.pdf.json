ABSTRACT","From a well represented sample of world languages Steele (1978) shows that about 70% of languages exhibit significant word order variation. Only recently has this wlde-spread phenomenon been drawing appropriate attention. Perhaps ID/LP (Immediate Dominance and Linear Precedence) framework is the most debated theories in this area. We point out some difficulties in processing standard ID/LP grammar and present a modified version of the grammar. In the modified version, the right hand side of phrase structure rules is treated as a set or partially ordered set. An instance of the framework is implemented. 1. Introduction","From a well represented sample of world languages Steele (1978) ~,~hows that about 76~ of the languages exhibit significant word order variation | . Until recently thls widespread phenomenon was not given proper attention in natural language processing. The primary goal of tbis study is to develop eomputatlonally efficient and linguistically adequate strategles for parsing word order variation. The strategies are implemented in a network based parser. At first we characterize the basic problem at an abstract level without going into details of the problem in any specific language (in Section-2). Then~ in Sectlon-3, the details of the problems in a specific language~ namely~ Iilndi~ are presented.","The Immediate dominance and linear precedence (ID/LP) framework~ developed by Gazdar and Pullum~ is one of the most debated theories in the study of word order variation (Pullum 1982~ Uszkorelt 1082, Shieber 1983, Barton 1985). The basic idea behind ID/LP framework is to separate immediate dominance from linear precedence in rewrite rules. Pullum (1982) expresses this via a metagrammar. The modified version presented in this paper expresses this directly in the object grammar eliminating the need for a metagrammar. It treats the right hand side of a PS (Phrase Structure) rule as a set or partially ordered set. Parsing with this type of rule can proceed by checking set membership. 2. The Word Order Problem in General","The word order problem is the problem of processing the whole range of word order variation occurring in natural languages. Some Australian languages such as Warlpiri show extreme word order variation (Hale 1983). Hindi, Japanese and German also allow considerable word order variation. In this section we develop descriptive formalisms and parsing mechanisms that are adequate for the whole range of word order variation.","Consider a grammar thdt allows a node labeled S to have daughters labeled $, O, and ¥ in any linear order~ and nothing else. Such a grammar can be presented with a set of rules such as that given in (2.1).","(2.1) S --> $ OV, S --> $VO, S --> 0 SV, S--> OV$, S--> V$O, S--> VO$","The problem with a grammar such as that given in (2.1) is that i~ needs too many rules to capture word order variation (in this case free word order). For 5 'words' such a grammar will need 5! = 120 rules. With the increase in the number of words, such a gralnmar will grow factorially. That is, for a number of words it will need n/ rules.","There is a convYnient way of 'collapsing' rules in GPSG (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar) of Gazder (1981). It uses metarules that operate on basic rules to generate derived rules which then function as basic rules in derivations. Thus, (2.1) can be abbreviated as (2.2). (2.2) Basic rule: [_~ $ O V] Metarule: [5....X...Y...] =:> [S....y...X...] where X and Y range over $, O, V.","Within GPSG Pullmn (1982) suggests another solution which also involves a metagrammar, tie suggests that a grammar such as (2.1) can be expressed via a metagrammar that treats immediate dominance and linear precedence separately. Pullum's theory is known as ID/LP analysis 2 According to this theory grammar (2.1) \"would be specified by means of the metagrammar\" given in (2.3). Similarlyj the metagrammar given in (2.4) \"determines\" the grammar shown in (2.5). In (2.3) and (2.4) i ..... diate doml .... e star .... ts are given under a~ and linear precedence statements are given~ under b. In the case of (2.3) however the set of linear precedence statements is empty. In the case of (2.4) $ ( O means 'it\" any rule introduces $ and O, $ linearly precedes O'.

The main disadvantage of the standard ID/LP framework is th~:t it is difficult to process (Shieber 1983, Barton 1985).","The alternative solution proposed in this study treats the rigbt hand side of a rule as a set3 . Thus~ the grammar in (2.1) can be p ..... ted in this format, eith .... (2.6a) or as (2.6b). The latter rule is to be understood under the node admissibility condition."]},{"title":"(2.a)a.

Firstly~ the factorial growth of rules is eliminated. Secondly~ parsing can proceed by checking set membership or set difference. That is, instead of 'ordered match' the parser has to do 'unordered match'. The precise way of doing it will vary from parser to parser. We describe one way of implementing it in the ATN (Augmented Transition Network (Woods 1970, Finln and Hadden 1977)) formalism.","Consider the ATN fragment presented below in (2.7) for the grammar given in (2.6).

The ATN given in (2.7) can be said to have conditioned multiple loops. For convenience of reference, we shall refer to ATN structures such as (2.7) as 'set-loops'. Further restrictions on set-loops (such as (2.7)) can be imposed and all constituent order variations can be parsed simply by imposing additional conditions on arcs. Thus, an ATN parser such as (2.8b) can parse the language generated by the grammar given in (2.5). Formally, (2.5) is presented with a partially ordered set such as (2.8a) in the proposed framework.

However, in natural language we often find a discontinuous constituent.

Word Order in Hindi","In Hindl, the order of the major constituents such as $ (Subject), O (direct Object), I (Indirect object), and V (Verb (+aux)) is free.

(3.14) captures constituent order variation in Hindl in a general way. However, it is to be noted that sentences such as (3.11.1) have bl-transltive (or double transitive) V. We have to impose more conditions on arc 5, POP, to parse intransitive and transitive sentences. Informally, the conditions are: (1 / If the V is intransitive then the I and O must be empty. (2) If the V is transitive then the I must be empty. We have implemented a large parser of Hindl wlth wide coverage of construction types including relative clauses, interrogatives, passives, dative subjects, compound verbs and gapping which interact with word order variation (see Dey 1982, 1984).","Word order variation in Hindl is fairly restrictive.
