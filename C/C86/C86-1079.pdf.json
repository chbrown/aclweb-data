The theory is intended as a complete projection of linguistic semantics onto NLP and is designed as sa exhaustive list of possible choices among strategies of aementlc analysis at each level, from the word to the entire text. The alternatives are summarized in a chart, w~ch can be ccmpleted for each existing or projected MLP system. The remaining components of the applied theory are also outlined. i.

The modern concept of linguistic theory, developed primarily by Ch~sky (1965), is that of a set of statements which i) characterizes language as a cc~plex structure sad describe that structure tap down, 2) underlies each description of a particular language and determines the format of such a description. Semantic theory as part of linguistic theory determines semantic descriptiens. Semantic descriptions assign mesaings to sentences, and each meaning is a fonmala logically deduced from the rules provided by seamntic theory ald utilized in the descr~tion. A valid semantic description assigns each sentence the sere meaning that the native speaker does.","The theoretical inadequacy of m/ch of contemporary linguistics may stem from Chomsky's ~ that the theory is one.

A meaningful application of linguistics always deals with a problem which comes entirely from the area of application and not from linguistics. Every ~ system requires the description of a natural language fragment, often of a sublsaguage. On the one hand, modem linguistics, with its emphasis on formality, would seem to be uniquely sad unprecedentedly qualified to supply such a description. On the other band, while every single fact about language the ~P expert needs is out there in linguia~ics, much of it is not easily ancessible. Descriptions posing as theories or theories posing as descriptions tend not to list all the necessary facts in any way facilitating computer Jmpemsatation (see below). The only solution to the problem is to develop a ~ .m ~omBtm ~ ~ pmdemm~ ~ k*mwledg~ onto NLP, which is what ALT/NLP is ell about.","2.3. ~ Theo~, I: ALT/NLP. ALT/hLP deals with pretty much the same facts and phenomena of language as linguistics per s e. There are, however, eroaial differences. First, while both \"pure\" and \"applied\" theories are formal, the nature of the fo~d/sm is differ~mt. Second, pure linguistic theory deals with a language as a whole while ALT/~LP deals with limited and relatively closed sublalgusges or language fragments (sen Raakin 1971, 1974, 1985b; Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982).","Third, pure linguistic theory must ansure a complete and even coverage of everything in the texture of language; ALT/hLP analyze only as much as needed for the purposes of NLP and ignore all the linguistic informatisa that is superfluous for it. Fourth, the ultimate criterion of validity for pure linguistic theory is the elusive explanatory adequacy; the ultimate criterion for ALT/h[2 is whether ~ systems resulting from its application work.","Fifth, pure linguistic theory can afford not to pursue the issue once a method or a principle is established. In ALT/hLP, everything should be dose explicitly to tlm very end, and no eKtrapolatios is possible. And finally, pure linguistic t/~eory has to be concerned about the botmdary between linguistic and encyclopedic knowledge, i.e., between cur knowledge of language and our knowledge of the world (cf. Raskin 1985a). There may be no particular need to maintain this distinction in an hLP system (cf. Schenk et al. 1985) because the computer needs all the I~nds of available information for processing the data.","2.4. ~ ~ II: ASLT/hLP. AS~, a pr~ection of lin~dstic mmm~ties onto NLY, is designed to serve all the various hip systems. Therefore, it is viewed sad set up as the e~mnative list of possibilities for semantic m~lysls and de~ription available in linguistic semantics.","The intended use of A~T/NLP is to bring to the NiP ousta~er, not necessarily knowledgeable in linguistics, the totality of what linguistics knows about meaning by i) listing ell the choices available at each level of sanmntic analysis, 2) determining causal connections among choices sad the propagation of constraints through the choice space, 3) assessing say existing NLP system as to the c~lexity of its ssnantic equipment sad the possibilities of expanding it in the desired direction if necessary, and 4) relating each chain of compatible choices to the practical needs and resources. This paper deals almost ~clusively with the first item on this agenda.","3. The ~ Scale of Semantic Anal sy~.","The scale proposed in this section is a list of choices","available at each of the five levels of semantic m~slysis","corresl0cnding to the five meaningful linguistic entities","pertinent to ELP - the word, the ~, the sentence, the","and the text, or discourse.

(v) However, in the case of a D]IMS, there may be far less relationship between the data as ~ by the user and as stored in the computer, than between, say, arrays as defined in a typical programming language and the representation of those arrays in memory."]},{"title":"338","paragraphs":["3.

In lings~stic semantics, the concept of semantic field (sea, for instsnce, Raskln 1983:31-2) corresponds to a primitive network. In a pure netwozk-besed approach, only actual words serve as the nodes - there are no nmta~ords or categorJal ma~ers (unlike in syntactical trees) and no primes (unlike in feature analysis). The netwonks may have weighted or tmweighted ].inks (edges); they may also, or alternatively, be labeled or tmlabeled. The number of labels may vary. The labels cen also he set up as the other kind of nodes. Generally, the nodes caa be equal (flat) or unequal (hierarchical). ~Ims, redness may be set up as a node while ___~ is a slot of a physical object, connected with the redness node by the link color.","3.2. The Clanse. The clause boundaries are obtained through tl~ application of a syntactic parser. The full/partial dimession at this level deals with whether every cl~ase of the sentence is armlyzed or some are omitted, and the latter is not Jmpasslble. The unlimited/limited dimension deals with the detalization of the analysis along the various paraneters (see below). Decisions on both of the (lims~ioas may be predeteunined by those taken at the ~rd level. In general, the ~ll/partial and unlimited/llmited dimensions become the more trivial and obvious the higher the level.

The Sentence. The first important phenomenon to consider at the sentence level is whether the sentence is represented as a claasal d~cmmse sfcxt~tmu~ or not. If the sentence is not represented as such a structure, it becomes simply a sequence of classes suited by syntactical dependency infomnatien. ~mh a sequence will not be much distinct from a sequence of monoclaussl sentences, e~ept that some of them will be eEustered together. If the clausal discourse structure is there, it will be probably presented as a graph with the clauses for nodes and relations between them for link labels. Again, as in the case of the clause, the link labels may renge fron the syntactic ten~s to semantic relations.
