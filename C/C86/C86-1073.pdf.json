I sketch a valency theory in linguistic terms which includes the discussion of the nature of dependency representation as an interface for semantic description. (2) The dependency representation in the translation process. I try to sketch the different roles of dependency representation in analysis and generation. 3) The impl~m~_ntation of valency theory in an MT-system. I give a few examples for how a valency d~xzription could be impleme~ted in the EUROTRA-formalism. O. Introduct:[on This paper ~ies to apply a piece of established linguistics, known as valency theory, to the problem of machine translation. As such, it is meant to fit into the forthcoming EUROTRA MT system, though it does not deal with EUROTRA problems sp~;ifically. There are two aspects which play a role in the building of ~Ln Ff£-syste~; (i) the development of linguistic specifications and (2) the development of a formalism which allows for the implemenlmtion of linguistic results. ~lis paper aninly deals with the first aspect and ~/~us relates not only to EUNOTRA but also at least to all stratificational systems, i.e. systems t2mt break up the translation process into a sequence of sJx~#ler translation processes. Furthermore it relates at least to any system wi]ich uses dependency/valency inforalation as e.g. IAgG does with its functional structure. In EUROTRA, the level where information about dependency/valency is used is the hqIS (Eurotra-Relational-Structure) which lies between the constitueat stzncture (ECS) and the semantic intea-face stzucture (IS). So, in EOROZRA terms I try here to give a kind of ERS-definition in the language of empirical linguistics without touching the formalism itself. The investigation divides into three parts: (i) the sketch of a v~l.ency theory which comprises the following points: - the informal definition of the concepts valency, cc~plement,ar~ adjunct, thereby trying to give a definition which holds for verbs, adjectives, nouns, and prepositions, -","the operationalizati~1 of the complement adjunct distinction derived frc~! this definition, -","the classification of the complements, a subclassification of f~e complement classes (C-classes) according to their syntactic realization, and the determination of the relevant sentence patterns, -","a short discussion of the relation of the dependency level to constituency level and from dependency level to semantic representation. (2) the application of the linguistic specifications to the problem of MT which llas to investigate the role of dependency representation (D-representation) (oi\" rather the role of the transitions to D-representation, since levels do not \"play a role\") in an,91ysis and generation. (3) the way the gained linguistic information can be implemented according to the EOROTRA formalism. i. Outline of a Syntactic Val~ ~_~ I. 1 Definition of Concej3~s The syntactic vale~zy of an el~ent of a word class (a nonterminal category) is its property to bind a certain number and a certa~ kind of syntagma. Those valency--bound syn'l~o~,'e:-~ are the oon~icm~e~ts. 'I~e s%a~tagnms which are ~t valency-bound are the adjuncts. All syntagmas which are obligatory in a syntactical sense are valency-bound, i.e. the sentence a~st contain tt~t item otherwise it would not be complete. Bedsides the obligatory syntagmas the wordL~ubclass specific elea~ts are valency-bound (Engel 1982). Wordsubclass specific e]em~--nts are those syntagmas which can occur only with elemlents of wordsub-classes. i. 2 Qperationalization of valency 'fhis point usually forms the major part of each paper on vale~cy theory and mostly consists of a discussion of various proposed tests in the literature on valency theory showing their deficiencies and ccmdng up with a new proposal. 307 ~e discussion of proposed tests will Im left out .in t~is ~ and the proposal for an operationalization tb~t will be made consists of an adaption of a test which has already imen established m~ which ~x3uld be called \"the free addibility test\"° This test will k~ l~filled here. and is ~lus a \"n~x]j.fie~ addibility test.\" It, will be. explained. ~min].y by applying it to verb valenc~ lxl't is also meant to apply to word--,classe~ oth.ea~ 'tt~ ver~x~.

In this case, a translation in the sense of a stratificational MT-system is very problematic without a tree-flattening procedure. This procedure could be justified linguistically because a C-grmmnar generating flat trees can generate the same sentences as a Cgr~ which generates deep trees. i. 4. i ~_~cy and semantic_ ~_presentation The complement/adjunct distinction which has been made on the syntactic level using purely syntactic tests is of sentence-se~mntic importance. Eac/~ semantic representation, be it based on symbolic logic e.g. Montague Grammar or on a case gr~, is usually implicitly based on the complement adjunct distinction. There are, however, exceptions. E.g. Fillmore's \"instrumental\" is an adjunct according to the above mentioned tests (hc~ever, marked as doubtful) since it has the very same status as the other roles in Fillmore's fra~- work. The differentiation between ccai01ement and adjunct is made in Systentic Functional Grammar (Halliday, Fawcett) by distinguishing between participant roles and circumstantial roles. The participant role is a semantic interpretation of the complement-verb relation, whereas the circum-stantial role is the s~antic interpretation of the adjunct-verb or adjunct-clause relation. As has been shown (Projektc~pe Vel~lenz 1981) the complement verb relation can be interpreted semantically in a lambda categorial granuuar. A semantic description of an expression of natural lanc~ge in a lambda categorial grmmnar consisits of a translation into an expression of the artificial language lambda L and of a mode] theoretic interpretation of this lambda L expression. Valency frames of verbs are represented in a lambda categorial grammar as the number of lambda prefixes the translated expression receives by the translation into lambda L°","The lambda operator can bind a variable in its and makes predicates out of sentence~. (17) lambda x [schl~ft (x)] (ein x sein, das","lambda x [sleeps (x)] (to be an x that sleeps) Two-place predicates are represented like (18) o","(18) lambda xl [la~0da x2 [betl-dChtet (xl,x2)] lambda xl [im~da x2"]},{"title":"[i~","paragraphs":["at (xl,x2)] I shall not try to show how such an expression is"]},{"title":"310","paragraphs":["interpreted in a model. The point that is made here is that a c~mantic description in the frame of a lambda categorial grammar uses the syntactic relation between c~plement and governir~ verb as t2m basis of its sentence - semantic description. 2. The role of the syntactic dep~ re oresentation level in M~ The facts discussed purely linguistically in section 1 give clear guidelines for application in MT. 2.1 ~_n_cy structure (D-struct~ire) in analysis The depende/~cy representation (D-representation) serves two ~rpeses: a) The tr~unslation into the D~representation relates the D-structure to the syntagn~s analyzed on the C-level and thus contributes to the disambiguation of the C-structures which cannot be achieved on the C-level as these can only be readied by the valency statements. (This at ].east is the case if the two levels are strictly separated.) Usually, the constituent analysis delivers several readings for a longer sentence. Each NP in the genitive case for example, which is an attribute to a noun, has to be interpreted as a potential genitive valency of a verb. In this case, the transition from C-representation to D-representation filters many au~iguous structures by assigning the appropriate d-relation. As there are only a few German verbs with ge/litive valency, these readings are filtered out in ~st cases. b) A second function of the dependency stl~/cture is the disambiguation of the verbs (and other elements of word classes which have a valency frame). Differe~nt verb readings often are discriminated by different w~lency frames. An arbitrary example proves this:","(19) anziehe~, CO Die Mieten ziehen an. (Rents are rising. )","anziehen C0/Cl Fritz zieht die Bremse an. (Fritz pulls the brake. )","anziehen C0/CI/(C3) Die Fmtter zie/tt dem, Kind die Schuhe an. (The mother helps the child with the s/toes. ) In a sentence J/~ which the verb \"anziehen\" occurs with only one CO, the reading can be identified unambiguously and translated by t-rules into the IS (Interface) atom with the corresponding case role. (In EUROTRA~ the IS is designed as a semantic interpreted r~structure). 2.2 D-structure in qer~cation The task of the D~level in generation is the g~%eration of the target language D-structure from IS by assingw/ng the al~propriate (correct) surface syntactic valency fram~!~: In the source language, e.g. German, the verb \"sich erinnern\" has the syntactic valency frame C0/CA, (which is the ccmi01ement in the nominative case and a prepositional complement). In the target language English the verb \"remember\" has t21e fra~le C0/CI (which is the subject and the direct object). In the target language the language-specific surface syntactic valency frame (the direct object) is generated frc~ the interlingual IS. The D-structure is thus a precondition for the generation of cerrect censtituent surfaee structures aeoording to their valencies. (20) is an example. (It uses the case roles ,,pro ~ cessor\" and \"phenomenon\" according to systemic functional grammar. ) The translation under:foes the mentioned levels. Relevant for generation is IS(T) to ERS(T).

The /J~pleme~tation of D-Representation in the EUROTRA F1~mework 3.1. some ~ks on the EUROTI~A - Formalism The most important assumption in ~ is \"that translation between natural languages is a sequence of primitive translations between a number of levels of representation u' (Arnold et al. 1985b). Such a level of representation is a \"language L generated by a gramnar G and an interpretation I\" (Arnold et al.1985b). I specifies the syntactically and se~antically well-formed expressions of L. G consists of a set of atoms and a set of construc-- tots. Basically Atoms a]:~ the lexical entries, the constructors are the grammar rules on the different levels.

It is semantically well-formed if its arguments unify with the argument 311 places of the constructor arguments. ~e adjacent rep ~resentational levels are related by a translator whi(lh is a set of t-ruleso It has been said that trans].ations between representational levels are primitive which means that they are (a) compositional and (b) \"one shot\" (Arnold et al. 1985b) = (a) means that atom is translated to atom arm constructor 'to constructor, where at least the relaxati~% is all~ed that the number and order of construoC~ors differ° (b) means that the translator takes only well -~ formed e~<pressions of Gi and yields only well.-- for~t~xl exp~ssiorm~ of Gi+l (All, old et alo 198.510).

Some ideas for t/~e implementation of 13~ Struct~nxa in the Et~cotra formalism ~]%e imple~rltmtion of D-structure coruqists of what has been called patterns, in 1 and it has to be. done J/l the for~nlis~ sketched in 3.1. \".[]\",at: ~-mans t2~at for each of the patterns there l~s to be a set of ~str~t~z~. As impl~ntation Ires jt~t begun the. ideas here are sc~.~2~t \"vagina, and the proposals c~_rt~inly do not ~u~e all the possibilities the fonnalisn~ provides. 3.2.1 Sentence Patterru~ For s~ntences the g~neral pattexn ioo~ like (22)","(22) S{ ~9 } [gov{ I,t) }, o0~pll{ FO },..., c~p]~{ FD ),adjt~ncffc{ FD }*] %his is just what has been stated above. A sentence S with a featrLre description FD consists of the pattern with a governing verb with a feature de~ciption FD and a compl~ent eonfiguration each cc~lement with a featuz~ description FO plus an arbitrary number of adjtmct~s each adjunct wit/~ a feature description FD~ ~he above proposed subclassification by syntactic realization can be. handled by a cat feature. For patte~ C 0/C 1 (sentences with transitive ve~os) (23) is a~ example.","(23) S{ FD } [gov {cat--v,....}, CO {cat~-1%p, case=nero, .... }, C1 {cat=np, case=aoc .... ),adjunct{ FD }*] So, the implementation of the 150 subclassified sentence patterns consists in an entm~ration of the S - constructors acoording to (23). 3.2.2 NP-Patterns and AP-Patterns For NPs and APs the general patterns look like (24) :","(24) NP ( FD } [gev ( FD }, cc~pll { FD ),..., cc~i01n { FD },adjunct{ FD )*]","AP ( FD } Igor ( FD }, c~lZ { FD } .... , ec~pln ( FO }, adjuncb{ FD }*] The subclassification according to sy~tactic realization has \"to uF~ 1~e cat feature as J J% 3.2.1. 4.
