We have shown (M, Gross 1975) that given a verb, Or equivalently a simple sentence, the set of syntactic properties that describes its variations is unique: in general, no ether verb has an identical syntactic paradigm 3. As a consequence, the properties of each verbal construction must be represented in a texicon--grammar. The lexicon has no significance taken as an isolated component and the gr~rnmar tempera:at, viewed as independent of the lexicon, will have to be limited to certain complex sentences,","Since be-Adiective tetras are close to verbs, their description is quite similar, that is, they are considered as sentences.","We have apl}lied lexicon-grammar representation not only to the two obvious predicative parts of speech, verb and adjective, but to nouns and adverbs a~; well. In the same way as one adjoins the verb to be tn adjectives, we have ~ystematically introduced support verbs (Vsup) for nouns and adverbs, as in the following examples (Z.S, Harris 1976, M. Gross 1982, 1986):","Vsup ::: fO be Prep: The text ia in contradiction with the low","VSUp =: to h~ve This text has a certain importance for Bob 4","Vsup =: tO occur, etc. Accident8 occur at random The ~4ccident (was, happened, occurred, took place) late at night ~.-'UA--8~I;'Ot-~I;RS.-This research has been partly financed by contract \"P[]C Informatique LinggisUque\" 1985-86 from the Ministry of Research. 2. The notion of essential complement has been refined through the systematic study of 12,000 verbs of French (M. Gross 1975; J,-P. Boons, A. Gaillet, C. Locl~re 19YGa, 1976b, 1987) and a study of adverbials, that is, of nonessential complements (M. Gross 19~6). The subject arKI/or the con'lplements may be transformed and/or omitted through various syntactic operations, in particular, by nominalizing the verb (G. Gross, R. Vivbs 198E;), but the full information can be recovered (Z.S. Harris 1982). 3. A line of '~+'\" and \"\"'\" marks in FiGure 1 is such a paradigm. 4. Both examples are not isolated entries of the lexicon=grammar, but rather (Z,S, Harris 1964), transforms of other forms: fhJ~ text <::ontradi/.;ta the law This text is important for Bob $apport verbs are frequerd in technical texts, and may have stylistic variants, as in this last example,","Grammatical elements such as determiners, prepositions and conjunctions, do not belong to the lexicon-grammar in the same sense as the four major parts of speech do, siece they are parts ot structures or rules. For example, prepositions appear in the columns ef the lexicon-grammar.","An early representation of verbs in a lexicon-grammar of about 12,000 verbs is ftiven in figure t. Each row of the matrix is an entry whose main construction is defined by a table or class code. In figure I, the code G corresponds to the class of constructions: subject-verb-direct sentential complement, noted:","(1) N O V qee P (N O ts the subject and P stands for sentence). Each column is a syntactic property, and corresponds to a structure into which V may enter, roughly a syntactic transform of the main structure, ~or example, in columns we have placed the Passive forms, Extraposed and renominal forms. Thus, the related structures are semantically close. \"+\" sign at the intersection of a row and a column indicates that the ntry in the row is accepted in the structure associated to the column, \"-\" sign correspoeds to inacceptability. The process of accumulation that led to the formalized lexicon-grammar of 12,000 French verbs has run into what seemed to be at first a minor problem of representation of words: the difference between simple and compound words, On the one hand, there are simple words ~uch as the verb know and complex (idiomatic) forms such as keep in mind, Both forms play the same syetactic arid semantic role in sentences such as: Bob knows that Max ha~ moved to Tampa Bob keeps in mind that Max /)as moved to Tampa bat the lexical content (one word va three) requires different identification procedures (simple dictionary tooktJp vs a certain amount of syntactic analys}s).","The representation of fiGUre 1 treats two forms such as to know (,~erneone, something) arid to keep (someone, something] in mind m tf~ same way, thut~ emphasizing the semantic equivalence between simple and compound verbs,","Bet compoged terms raise ~;i problem of representation. The unit of representation in a linear lexicon is roughly the word 5 as defined by its written form, that is, a .~equence of letters separated from ne~lhbOring sequences by boundary bionic. As a consequence, compound words cam|of be directly put into a dictionary the way simple words are.

Compound adverbs","We call adverb any circumstancial complement, including sentent)al phrases, as in the following examples:","(1) The show took place nighlly el night during a busy night the night Bob missed his plane By compound adverbs, or frozen or idiomatic adverbs, we mean adverbs that can be separated into several words, with some or all of their words frozen, that is, semantically and/or syntactically noncompositional. In (1), af night is a compound adverb, the lack of compositionality is apparent from lexical restrictions such as: *at day, *at afternoon, *at evening and by the impossibility of inserting material that is a priori plausible, syntactically and semantically: *at (coming. present) night *st (cold, dark) night during the (coming, present) night during s (cold, dark) night 5. Note that words or roots are often considered as units in most attempts to devise semantic representations. Notice that nightly can also be considered as a frozen compound, though not constituted of words but Of a word and a suffix. Again, lack of compositionality stems from the observation that daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. which are compounds of the same formal type have a regular formation, in the sense that their interpretation is homogeneous. Thus, nightly is an isolated case, as opposed to an open series of identical forms with a different interpretation.","The two other adverbs of (1) are tree forms. Thus, the determiners Det and modifiers (Adl and Re/clause) of: during Det Adj night Relclauae can vary freely (within semantic constraints). In the same way, tfm event associated with the sentence 8 in the form: the night (E, that) 8 can be expressed by a large variety of unconstrained forms.","Frozen or compound adverbs constitute the simplest case of compound forms because they do not allow variations of their components. As mentioned above, in at night no adjective is authorized. Moreover, one cannot insert a determiner: *at (a, this) night, the plural is forbidden: *at nights and no relative clause can be appended: *M night (that, which) was agreed on.","Such observations are general, and apply to many adverbs of varied form and lexical content:","It rained cats and dogs *many cats and dogs *big cats and dogs *cat and dog from time to tit~e ~trorn timet~ to times *from a time to another time from long time to long time Consequently, these compound adverbs could be identified by a simple recognRiorr procedure, for they do not require any lei, amatization or syntactic analysis to be reduced to a dictionary form, as is the case with verb for)as for example.","A lexieal study of compound adverbs has been performed in French and a systematic inventory has been compiled from various dictionaries. Runni,g texts have been examined as well. It is interesting to note that whereas in current dictionaries there are about 1,500 one word adverbs, most of them in -meat (-ly), we have found over 5,000 compound adverbs,","These compound adverbs have been classihed according to their sywtacltc shape. The syntactic forms are described at the elementary level ef sequences of fmrts of speech. We use symbols with obvious interpretations such as Prep, Dot, Adl, N, V, COOl (fay conjunction) and W for a variable ranging over verb complements, etc. We write: Prep N =: at night Prep Dot N =: in the end Prep Dot Adf N =: in the long rim","Prop Oel, N el Dot N =: in every nonce of the word at the point of a gun Prop Def N Ceni Dot N =: time and again V W =: to begin with S =: all things being equal","F gure 2 shows the classes that have been defined on this basis, together with examples and the number el, items in each (:lass;","..... i PO PAD% Adv"]},{"title":"_ _ |~oad~,fin","paragraphs":["..... | -.~ __ PC Ihap (\""]},{"title":"] en bref 1 ,160","paragraphs":["P[)l~q( Prep De~ C"]},{"title":"lco,m-e tome atzente","paragraphs":["570","/","!","PAC Prep adi ¢"]},{"title":"+++e","paragraphs":["sa hel,h, mort 440 /","1","pea P~+pCAdj"]},{"title":"~ d ~o,'~e ~l+,l..+ t ~oo l","paragraphs":["PCDN Prap C de N [,'hi"]},{"title":"maven tie","paragraphs":["N / 330 / PCP( i lhdp ( Pr~:p C [de.~"]},{"title":"plods d {a 1~1% 240 - ' .....

Itence, as a i)vuctical matter, they can be located iu a text by using the search function available for strings in any text editor system. There are however more complex examples that require deeper analysis. Consider fay example the idiomatic adverb in the sentence: Max propoaed 8ohrtiena from l,he top of his hat It ic largely frozen: no other determiner is allowed, no adjectives can be appended to either noun, etc., but the person of the possessive adjective Pone, may vary. This possessive adjective must refer to the subject of the sentence, and varies accordingly: *Max propound ideas from the top el your hat *My staler proposed ideas from the top of his hat Bob and Max proposed ideas from the top of their hat(8) In this case. the recognition procedure is no longer a simple string matching operation, since a variable slot must be dealt with inside the fixed string. More general matching rules are required here 6. Once this compound adverb l,laa been identified in a text to be processed, it can be given an iaterpt~etation, for example in terms of a simple adverb such as teiaarely or lightly and the referential information carried by Pots can then be ignored. Itowever, one oar] easily construct particular discourses where the obligatory cereference relation involved will (bsambiguate some analysis. Thus, not only the variatien of Poaa must be accounted l,or at the lexical level, but its referential infermatien has to be kept l,or possible use in a parser.","{fiber compound adverbs oiler different degrees of variation. There m'e cases where one part of the adverb is frozen and another part is entirely free: Max organized a party in honor of Bob Max hid the car at the far end of the parking lot The parts in honor, al the far end are frozen. For example, they do not allow modil,iers. The parts of N are tree, for we observe variations such as: Max organized a party in hJa honor Max hid the car at the lar end, I think, of the parking lot Consider the adverbials: for the sake of ruining thinfjs for the sake of Bob for God's sake We (:all the combinatien for--cake frozen, since the noun sake does not occur elsewhere than in adverbial phrases with the preposition for: it cannot be the subject or object of any verb. On the other hand, the modifiers of sake are quite varied and regular from the point of view of the syntax of noun modifiers 7.","There are also cases of seemingly free adverbs which require an ad hoc treatment. For example, dates such as: Monday March 13, 1968 at 9 pan. are described it) a natural way by a finite automaton.","Tecl;nical or specialized families of adverbs come close to being frozeu adverbs: (2) They elected Bob on the (firsl, second) ballot (3) Max ate his noodles in a bow/ The special semantic relations that hold between the adverbial complement and the rest el, the sentence are lirmted. There are few verbs such as to eat which combine with in a bowl and which have the non locative interpretation of (3). The usual interpretation is thai found in: 6. PRDLOG rules are particularly well adapted to recognizing such frozen forms (P. Sabatier 1980). 7. There are nonetheless restrictions on them: ~for a heavenly ,~oke Max puF hia noodle~ in a bowl","Entering ITozen adverbs into a lexicon-grammar raises many r=ew questions, The bulk of adverbs can be described by means of the Following type of derivation (Z.S, Harris 197¢): Bob left; 7hat Bob left occurred at 9 : Bob left, fhia occurred at 9 :: Bob left at 9 and sulaport verbs play a crucial role here. However, there are cases where no general support verb is found and where adverbs have to be considered as a part of the elementary sentence. Consider the adverb in: Bob sang at the top of hJ~ voice It is syntactically and semantically analogous to tree adverbs such as noisily, powerfelly. For these two free adverbs, a derivational source involving the adjective is available: The way Bob sang was (noiay, powertn/) This is not the case for at the top of his voice which is practically limited to modifying the verbs of saying. Moreover the obbgatory coreference link of hia leads to a representation where this adverb is not analyzed. Thus two semantically similar types of adverbs have to be represented quite differently in the lexicon-grammar. All the situations just exemplified with adverbs are quite common, cod are also encountered with nouns, adjectives and verbs. The paradox el ~ relaresentatJon they lead to can only be solved by introducing a complex level of semantic equivalence for the entries of the lexicon-grammar, 2, Compound nouns","C~n'npound nouns form the bulk of the lexicon of languages. Language creativity is largely associated with the growth of technical vocabularies which consist mainly of technical nouns. Compound nouns number in the millions for European laoguages. They are usually built rrem the vocabulary of simple words by means or grammatical rules which may involve grammatical words. By definition, their meaniog is nencompositional. The compound nouns can be described in terms of the sequence of their grammatical categories, in the same way as for adverbs (IA. Gross, D. Tremblay 1985). We have for example: Det N =: the moon Adl N =: crude oil, real ealaFe N of N =: elroke of luck,","board of (governors, regenfa) Det N of Dot N =: the talk of the town N N =: lest lobe, color 7V Such nouns can become quite complex in various technical Fields.","In general, compound nouns allow variations of determiners and modifiers, but many situations are encountered:","the moon is a frozen combination, -- definite article-noun -- which behaves like a proper name, because ot its unicity of reference. It cannot be modified by adjectives without losing its reference: *the (big, yellow) moon;","crude oil takes restricted determiners. Since it is a mass noun, there are difficulties in accepting its plural, It can be modified by adjectives and nouns as in (cheap, high quality) crude oH, but these cannot modify el/: *crude, (cheap, high quality) oil;","stroke of luck has unrestricted determiners and modifiers, bat no iosertion is allowed immediately before or next to of, in particular luck cannot be modified: *stroke of gor~ luckS; 8. ~,lrnko of bad luck would be a different compound word, whose relation to afroke of luck is only etymological. - board of governors one be modified in several ways: board a~ld governora ta.ke separate determiners and modifiers: ~he powerful boarda of the twelve governora of my bank, Such a compound noun comes close to being a free Form. It is the liruited number of second aeons such as director, governor or regent that suggests we are dealing with a compound noun. Also, the meameg of these phrases is nonoompoaitional in the sense that they have a legal or institutional meaoing that their components do not have clearly.","The variations of lurer we have enumerated can be partly hal'=died bit atlcachiag a finite automaton to a given entry, and this automaton will describe the main grammatical changes allowed The adjunction o~ free relative clauses to compound nouns may require a different treatment","\"l~)e kiads of variation of compound nouns are aO numereu,~ that cletermieing whether a given nomit)al coostruction is a compouod noun or nol: almost requires c~. original demonstratiou.

Compound verbs","Compound verbs or frozerl sentences as we have termed them (M. Gross 1982), can be described as sequences of categories. We write N i for variable noun phrases and C i for frozen noun phrases. For subjects; i = 0, for complements: i = I, 2. Examples are: (I) N O V C t =: Bob hit the /ackpot (2) N 0 V N 1 Prep C 2 =: Bob took your project into account (3) N 0 V CI Prep C 2 =: Bob look the bull by Ihe heron (4) N°~ C 0 V C t =: Bob'a dream came true","We outlined in I the description ot a lexicon-grammar of French v~bs and the reasons why compound verbs had to be separated from simple On~S.","~;ystematic search through dictionaries (monolingaal, bilingual, and specialized) has yielded close to 20,000 compound verbs belonging to the same level of language as the 12,000 simple verbs.

For example, there is no reason to attach the Passive marking to the verb rather than to either of the complements of the utterance to put the cart before the horse, Lexicon-grammar representations eliminate such questions by dolocalizing the syntactic information and by attaching it to the full sentence, In this sense, compound expressions provide a powerful n]etivation for representing lexical and syntactic phenomena in the form of a lexicon-grammar. 11. The saree use of se(luences of syntactic categories is found in n string grammar (Z.S+ Harris 1961), which has proven to be quite efficient in syntactic recognition (N, Sager 1981, M.
