This group was founded by Hsieh Ching-chun in 1986 and is currently directed by Keh- jiann Chen and Chu-Ren Huang (Chang et al. 1989, Hsieh et al. 1989, Chen et al. 1991). The CKIP research is divided into three sub-projects according to their goals: 1) An On-line Lexicon for NLP, 2) A Corpus, and 3) A Parser. The suit-projects are designed to create a self-sufficient and mutual supporting environment for Chinese NLI: The corpus will be the database supporting the electronic lexicon, while the lexicon will be the basic reterence for automatically tagging the corpus. Moreover, both the corpus and the lexicon will support the parser. Our parser adopts the unification-based formalism of ICG (information-based Case Grammar, Chen and Huang 199{)), which encodes all grammatical information on each lexical entry. At this point in time, the lexicon consists of a fully automated earlier version with limited grammatical information and an updated version with complete grammatical version for parsing, qtaere are more than 40 thousand entries in the completed electronic dictionary, which is available on-line in \"lttiwan and allows basic pattern-matching searches. There is also a PC version with reduced search capacity available from the Industrial 'l~echnology Research Institute, the primary funding agency of this pilot dictionary project. The updated version now contains roughly 30 thousand entries with complete grammatical information and another60 thousand with basic grammatical categories. Manipulation of lexical information such as addition of entries and specification of detailed grammatical information with respect to each attribute is maintained on-line (Jian and Chen 1991). The completed 90 thousand word lexicon will be our core lexicon fl)r pars- ing. The hierarchical arrangement will enable us to efficiently add new entries and create special lexicons for sub~lomains.","Many modules of the parser arc now under construction and some of them have been completed, such as a analyzer-generator for quantifier-measure compouods (Mo et al. 1901) and a look-up segmentation program (Chen and IAu 1992). Both the compound analyzer-generator and the segmentation program perform well. The recognition rate fl)r the segmentation program, excluding proper names and derived words, is 99.77%. Since neither proper names nor word breaks are marked in the writing system, they will have to be dealt with separate modules using both morphological and heuristic information. The analyzer-generator has the perfect recognition rate of 100% while allowing over-generation and ambiguity, which also often involve proper names and derived words. The corpus portion of the project is mainly funded through a grant from the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation lot International Scholarly Exchanges to Academia Sinica and the University of London, and is supported by matching funds from Academia Sinica. I~aul Thompson is the Co-Principle hwestigator at tim University of London. The COBUIt,D project of the University of Birmingham also offers technical consulta-tion. Of the 12 linguists working full time in the CKIP group, five are assigned to the corpus project in addition to three programmers. II. Sources and Size of"]},{"title":"the Corpus","paragraphs":["A strategical decision was made early in our project to build separate corpora for both classical and modern Chinese. This is not only because the same lexical computing techniques can be used lor both modern and classical Chinese (data are represented as Chinese characters), but also because we think it will be interest-ing to compare the result of an open aud artificially balanced corpus (the modern one) with a completed but randomly balanced corpus (the classical one). In addition, the impact on linguistic research will probably be more immediate and obvious in diachronical studies AcrEs DE COLING-92. NAN~IdS, 23-28 AOt~,r 1992 1 2 I 4 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 titan in synchronical studies. Hence, tile classical cot'- pus is defined in terms of time (roughly all existing text written before 0 B.C.) and the modmn corpus is defined by size (7 -l(I million words tagged text in two years). This also sct the direction of future development: the classical corpora will develop clironologically through the time while the modcrn corpora will cxpand both in size and in domain--specific corl~)ra. The following texts are acquired ill the first stage: l) Modern Chinese A. 10 million characters of texts (word breaks are m)t used in Chinese writing systems, but the average word length is a little nlore than two characters) from three months of the l.iberal Thnes, a daily newspaper. B. 10 million characters fi'om the China Tiates group. Agreement was reached ha October, 1991 with thc China Times group, one of the two ucwspaper giants in'lhiwall, to provide daily on-line text to our project. Thus we will have a dependable and unlimited source of data (up to one million characters a day). The group pu-. blishes three newspapers, tleveral nlagazines, and has a separate book-publishing subsidiary. C. Al~mt one million words of data previously input by the CKIP project. This includes 10 articles front a magazine and explanatkm text ft~la a dictionary. D. 30 thoummd words of tran.~libed spoken text. This section will be input in ltF)2. Newspapers are tile nlainstay of our data source fur the otwious reason that the newspaper texts are on line. But it is also a (xmvenient text containing many vmieties of writing, including spoken couver~tion (in~ terviews), commentaries, translations (foreign dispatches), and all genres of literary styles (Chinese newspapers arc different from the Westeln ones in hav-ing daily literature suppleinentaries, and are the most important venue for literary publications), llowevev, because of difficul-- tics ill converting different charactcr-ca~ling and mark-up systems, we can only incorporate news from China Tintes to otn corpus so far. tither types of texts should be available by fall 1092. 2) The Classical Corpns Roughly three million characters of Chinese written prose have smvived frmn the years before Christ was born (i.e. from all tile periods up to the Western Hart Dynasty). A corpus of roughly 1.5 million characters of the text is now available in machine readable forms from a previous prolect in Academia Sinica, the remaining 1.5 million characters arc now being keyed in and will be on-line by mid-1992. 111. Functions and Applications It is out\" hmg term goals for the Corpus to have the automatic dictionary compiling abilities, fashioned aftcr COBUILI) (Sinclair 1987, iN)l), adapted for both parsing and hard- copy publishing. In the flirt stage, however, we concentrate on developing tools for linguistic research. We will describe the search functions that we have developed so far. Most of the functions are character-based now and call be upgraded to word-based once we incorporate our tagger and word segmentation naKlule. The search utility in our corpus is basically a KWIC (key wtlrd-in~m-- text) search based on Chinese characters. Our search progranl allows the linguists to specify both the size of right-and left-hallO side cxmtext sh(lwn as the search resnlt. There is also a randomizer to chm)se a more manageable size of data if the search result is too big (more than a thou- sand citations). The ordering of data is done in the traditional way in terms of nu tubers of strokes in tile character in the immediate context. This is not the ideal methtxl but may be the best available before we can deveh)p a system which is ln)ttt linguistically and hem-istically more ~phisticated. A romanizatiml based articling s~ystem would be even less desirable fl)r the lack of unifl~rm (and familiar) romanization system ill 'lliiwan and h~r the failure to disamhiguiate homonyms. In addition to the basic s(~irell procedures, the following customized search commands are added to serve tile need of linguistic research. 1) # < kw > # : a context where a key word is both preceded and followed by the mime word. 2) AA : leduplicatiml (one character) 3) AllAll : reduplicatiml (two characters) 4) < kwl > * < kw2 > : crax~;urreuces of two key words in a (possibly) di~ontinuous context. 5) < kwl >/I < kw2 > : context where a key word (kw2) is 'left- disassociatcd' fronl another key word (kwl), i.e. where the sccnnd key word does not (recur in the left-context of the first key word. 6) < kwl >/r < kw2 > : context where a key word (kw2) is 'right-disassociated' from another key word (kwl), i.e. where tile secured key word does not occur in the right-context of the first key word. t ;ommands 1)-3) are helpful tools in studying morphological rules and identifying morphological constmctions for Chinese. Since Chinese writing systems do not include word-breaks, and since no lexicon can ever offer a complete list of words, word segmentatkm is non-trivial in Chinese Language Processing (Chert and Liu 1992). Identifying and util~ing morphological information is therefore essential Ix)th in lexical computing and in natural language processing. ACnT.S Dr. COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 1 2 1 5 PROC. OF COLING-92, NAN-rES, AUG. 23-28, 1992","Command 4) is a handy tool to discover cooccurrence restrictions and their semantic consequences.","Commands 5) and 6) are used to eliminate ambiguity and to cut down the size of search results.","It can be noted that since our tagger is not running yet and since the Chinese running text seldom defines a sentence by a period (a whole paragraph often contains only one period and many commas), the above commands use number of characters rather than sentence markers to delimit search domains.","Concordance programs are also being developed for our project. The current version runs with our classical corpus. It is able to show both the text source of each concordance item as well as page numbers from the printed version for easy reference. This is originally developed on the HP workstation, the machine we now use, but a version that runs on IBM PC 486 with either SUN Unix or CCL Unix is also available now.","Another research tool that we developed deal with frequency counts of characters and words and statistical packages to compare linguistics and other textual features of the corpora. Like many other modules of our project, this module has been developed and completed mdependently. It has been tested on the un-tagged on-line classical Chinese database of the \"l~,enty-five Dynastic Histories (Hsieh 1991). This module is ready to be incorporated into the system."]},{"title":"IV. Accomplishments and Future Developments","paragraphs":["In this first stage of the development of a Chinese corpus for NLP and for linguistic research, we have achieved the primary goals of acquiring the core text data, and establishing a mutual-supporting environment between the lexical computing research on the corpus and the computational linguistics research on NLE Our systems are developed on HP workstations under Unix. The system should be portable to any Unix machine with compatible Chinese solution. For in-stance, we are porting each of our modules to a IBM PC 486 running Unix for the use of our collaborator in London.","In this preliminary stage, the most encouraging sign is that our human linguists have established productive interaction with the corpus. Human expertise helped to design search utilities pertinent to linguistic research and corpora provided both a convenient source of linguistic facts and a solid basis for deducing useful generalizations. With the basic KWIC search utilities, the CKIP project has finished several linguistic studies with the help of the corpus. Take Mo et al. (1991) for exampie, the quantifier-measure rule that our analyzer-generator uses is based on generalizations extracted from the corpus, and the program itsetf is tested on texts randomly selected from the corpus. Other linguistic works based on the corpus include Hong, Huang and Chen (1991) on morphological rules fl)r Chinese, and Mo, Huang and Chen on serial verb construction in Chinese (1991). This corpus is currently used by the CKIP project in their ac- counts of A-not-A questions, of resultative compounding, of nominalization, and of various reduplications.","Incorporation of an automatic tagger and extraction of grammatical information from the tagged corpora is the most important immediate future goals of this project. This, of course, depends crucially on a tagging system with theoretically well-structured attributes. A database for attributes is being developed with the 1N-FORMIX software. And we will folh)w the TEl guidelines (Sperber-McQueen and Burnard 1990) whenever possible. Our word segmentation program now doubles as a category-tagger. But this can only be viewed as a research aid for the linguists to detect categorical ambiguities and unlisted words. We also expect the on-goo ing linguistic research to identify more search functions and refine the existing utilities. Direct extraction of dictionaries and grammars should I)c feasible in five years."]},{"title":"Aeknowlegements:","paragraphs":["Research of this project was partially funded by the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchanges.
