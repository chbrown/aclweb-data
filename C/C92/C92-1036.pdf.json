Previous linguistic study on the semantics of Japanese functional words such as dake did not pay enough attention to carefully distinguishing the pragmatic factors involved from the (lexical) semantic contents of those words. In order to build efficient natnral language systems, however, we believe that not only do we have to account for the semantics of eacb and every lexical items under consideration, but we need to have a general account of certain pragmatic aspects of the interpretations we obtain. One typical case of this kind of pragmatic inferences manifests itself in interpretations of Japanese sentences with dake , which roughly corresponds to the English word only. We believe that the kind of analysis we propose here is a prototypical example of what is necessary for successful natural language interpretation."]},{"title":"2 Differences in Interpretation of Dake-sentences","paragraphs":["It has been observed that there is a certain difference in meaning between the Japanese sentences shown in (1,a) and (1,b), according to the relative positioning of the two particles, dake (only) and de (by). (We will call the first type of sentences de-dake-sentences and tile second type dake-de-sentences for short. We will also call them in general, dake-sentences.)

According to Morita[8], (1,a) means that \"bike is the only means by which I can get there,\" i.e. \"1 can't get there by any means other than bike?' He called this tile 'absolute restriction' meaning. On the other hand, (1,b) roughly means that \"I can get there by bike alone,\" i.e. \"the minimally necessary means which enables me to get there is by bike.\" This be called tlLe 'minimal restriction' meaning. In this case, we have a reading ill which \"I call get there by any other means easier than bike.\" We can see that there is a similar difference in available readings for the corresponding English sentences, which are shown in (2). While (2,a) has the 'absolute restriction' meaning, (2,b) has the 'minimal restriction' meaning, in Morita's terminology. (2) a. 1 can get there only with a bike.","b. I can get there with only a bike. It might be suggested that the difference in the meanings of these sentences are due to the relative positioning of dake and de, in the case of Japanese, and that of only and with, in the case of English, which somehow causes the difference in the semantic scopes of dake or only. But when we look at other examples like (3), in which dake interact with particles other than de, it becomes obvious that the real phenomenon is a bit more complicated. (3) a.

In this paper, we will focus on these sentences and formulate the interpretive procedure which would explain the differences in these interpretations."]},{"title":"3 Previous Accounts for Japanese","paragraphs":["The difference in interpretation between de-dake-sentences and dake-de-sentenees has attracted attentions of Japanese linguists. We will summarize here Morita's[8] observations and Kuno's[5] generalizations. Morita[8] was the first to observe this difference and characterized these sentences as follows. Morlta's observations: (4) a. De-dake means 'absolute (exclusive) restric-","tion'.","b. Dake-de means 'minimal restriction'.","c. The alternation between dake and particles","other than de doesn't ca use this kind of dif-","ference. Each ordering means 'absolute restric-","tion'. Kuno[5] generalized Morita's observations to the ordering of particles in general and ascribed the difference in meaning of de-dake-sentences and dake-de-sentences to the semantic contents of these particles and the order they appear in the sentence. His generalizations can be summarized as in (5). Kuno's generalizations: (5) a. The ordering of particles (particle + quantifier-","like particle), such as de-dake, ni-dake, to-dake,","de-nomi, de-bakari, etc. means 'absolute (ex-","clusive) restriction'. b. The ordering of particles (quantifier-like parti-","cle + particl e) such as dake-de, dake-ni, dake-","to, norai-de, bakarl-de, etc. means 'minimal re-","striction'. c. The alternation between dake and particles","other than de does cause the difference in mean-","ing, but in some cases, the ordering (quantifier-","like particle q- particle) have 'absolute restric-","tion' meaning as a secondary meaning. From now on, we will call the ordering of particles (particle + dake), as in de-dake, p(article)-dake, the","ordering (dake + particle), dake-p(article). And we","will also call sentences with these orderings p.dake-","sentences and dake-p-sentenees, respectively. One common feature of these two accounts is that they are trying to capture the difference between the two types of sentences in the semantic contents of particular orderings of particles. On that basis, Morita claims that the semantic contents of de-dake and dake-de are different while relative order of dake and particles other than de does not affect the semantic contents of these sentences. Kuno, on the other hand, claims that the semantic contents of p-dake and dake-p are always different, and dake-p has one additional reading in some cases, in which it is equivalent to that ofp-dake. However, sentences like (6) is a straight-forward counterexample to their claims. Here, a dake-de sentence does not have the 'minimal restriction' meaning, although what Kuno meant exactly by 'the minimal restriction meaning' is somewhat unclear. (6) Soko-ni-wa zitensya dake de i-tta.","there-LOt-TOP bike only INST go-PAST","((I) got there by bike alone.) It is clear that the difference in meaning between p-dake-sentences and dake-p-sentences is a difference in the interpretations of the whole of these sentences, not a difference in the semantic contents of the particular part of the sentences.

Even among sentences involving dake and de, there are differences in available interpretations. The only difference among these sentences lies in the properties of their predicates. We see that the 'minimal restriction' meaning for dake-p-sentences is obtained only when the predicates involved express some \"possibility,\" such as ik-eru (can go) or naoru (can be cured). Taking into account examples that involve dake along with particles other than de, we notice that things get further complicated. We have already seen in (3) that in sentences involving dake and ni, we can get neither the 'necessity' part nor the 'scalar' part of the 'minimal restriction' meaning for a dake-ni-sentence, even when we use a \"possible\" predicate. When we do not use a \"possible\" predicate, we can't get the 'minimal restric-tion' meaning for dake-ni-sentences either, as shown in (13). (13) a. Kazoku ni dake siraseru.","family DAT only inform","((1) will inform (it) only to my family.)","b. Kazoku dake ni siraseru.","family only DAT inform","((I) will inform (it) to only my family.) From these observations, we have at least partial answers to the two questions we raised at the beginning of this section. As for the first question, we can say that when dake-p-sentenees involve certain predicates like 'ikeru', 'itta-koto-ga-aru', the 'absolute restriction' meaning tends to disappear. Moreover, when they involve de and \"possible\" predicates, they have the 'necessity' part as their semantic contents. For the second question, we would say that when dake-p-sentences involve de and \"possible\" predicates, they also have the 'scalar' part as their conversational implicature. When they involve de but not \"possible\" predicates, they neither have the 'necessity' part nor the 'scalar' part of the 'minimal restriction' meaning. These answers suggest that each part of the 'minimal restriction' meaning is tightly related, and, the particle de and \"possible\" predicates both play crucial roles in this phenomenon.","5 The Interpretive Procedure for Dake-sentences 5.1 De and \"Possible\" Context In the previous section, we observed that de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates are crucial to the difference in meaning between p-dake-sentences and dake-p-sentences. Then what is going on when de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates interact with each other? In order to see this, first consider what happens when we omit dake from (1) as shown in (14).","(14) Sokoni-wa zitensya de ik-eru. there-TOP bike INST go-can ((I) can get (there) by bike.) Intuitively, this sentence can be paraphrased as (15), without any difference in its interpretation.","(15) Sokoni-wa zitensya-o tukae-ba there-TOP bike-Ace use-if iku-koto-ga-dekiru. go-that-NOM-can (If (I) use a bike, (I) can get there.) We can get this conditional interpretation only when the sentence has a \"possible\" predicate as well as a de-phrase. As sentences in (16) and (17) show, this kind of interpretation for sentences with a de-phrase is unavailable when we do not have a \"possible\" predicate.","(16) Zitensya de iki-tai. bike INST go-want ((i) want to go (there) by bike.)","(17) Zitensya de iku-bekida. bike INST go-should ((You) should go (there) by bike.) Similarly, if there is no de-phrase, we do not get the conditional interpretation even when we have a \"possible\" predicate, as the following examples demonstrate.","(18) Zitensya o ka-eru. bike Ace buy-can ((I) can buy a bike.)","(19) Tookyo kara okur-eru. Tokyo from send-can ((I) can send (it) from Tokyo.) (20) Taroo ni a-eru.","Taroo DAT nleet-ean","((I) can meet with Taroo.) When de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates interact, the conditional interpretation becomes available. Note, incidentally, that in English too, similar observations can be made. Consider the English equivalent to (14), shown in (21). This sentence can be interpreted as synonymous with a conditional sentence in (22). (21) I can get there with a bike. (22) If I use a bike, I can get there. Stump[10] discusses this kind of interaction between \"possible\" predicates and free adjuncts. His main concern is how free adjuncts behave in modal contexts, and the typical examples he considers are shown in (23) arid (24). (23) a. Wearing that new outfit, Bill would fool every-","one.","b.

(23,a) and (24,a) are interpreted as their corresl/onding conditional sentences in (23,b) and (24,b). Ills proposal is that this kind of conditional interpretation for free adjuncts becomes available within semantics of modals. Free adjm,cts would be assingcd the same semantic type as conditional clauses, and so the conditional interpretation de-rives entirely from the semantic rules necessary for the interpretation of modals. lie uses Kratzer's[3] formalization for the semantic rules for modals; the semantic contents of (23) and (24) are expressed as follows.

Tim basic semantic content of Japanese dake is presumably ahnost the same as English only. Only is said to be a focusing operator[Ill.

Then its logical form can be expressed as in (34). (34) only((I use a bike))(2P(P --*can (I get the re))) This can be translated into (35). (35). VP[[P \"-*ca, (I get there)] ~ P = (I use a bike)] In (34), duke takes its scope over the whole modalized conditional interpretation, restricting antecedent condition for enabling me to get there only to \"using a bike.\" This expresses the 'absolute restriction' meaning correctly. Since there is no such condition other than using a bike which enables me to get there, /can't get there without a bike. As for (33,b), its focus is clearly the NP ziiensya and its scope is the whole antecedent sentence. Thus we obtain (36), and its translation (37). (36) only((a bike))()~z(I use x)) \"-+con (I g et there) (37) (I use a bike)AVy[(I use y)---* y = bike]","\"-'%an (I get there) This time, dake takes scope over the de-phrase, whose semantic content is roughly \"using a bike\", and excludes any other means of transportation. The semantic contents of the whole sentence would be something like, \"if I use a bike and do not use any other means, I can get there.\" In other words, \"it is sufficient for getting there that I use a bike and do not use any other means.\" This means that \"it is not necessary for getting there that I use any means other than bike\", which is exactly the 'necessity part' of the 'minimal restriction' meaning. In this way, 'how' part of the first question we raised in 4.2 is solved. Although (B) is stating an assump-tion for duke-p-sentences in general, there is only one case where dake-l~sentences have the 'necessity' part of the 'minimal restriction' meaning, that is the case where such sentences have de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates. In such cases, these sentences can get conditional interpretations due to those two independent facts. • De-phrases act like free adjuncts in English. • Free adjuncts in \"possible\" context can receive conditional interpretations by the semantic nature of \"possible\" predicates."]},{"title":"5.3 Conversational Implicature of Duke-sentences","paragraphs":["The remaining question is 'how' part of the second question in 4.2. We can restate the question as follows: * How can the 'scalar' part of the 'minimal restric-tion' meaning be derived conversationally? For this question, we observed in 4.2 that the 'scalar' part can be obtained when de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates interact. We saw in 5.1 that when de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates interact, we can get conditional interpretations. These facts suggest that the conditional interpretations of duke.de-sentences are somehow related to the 'scalar' implicature. Let us consider the original duke-de-sentence, again shown here. (1) b. Soko-ni-wa zitensya duke de ik-eru.","there-Loc-TOP bike only INST ~. go-can","((I) can get there by bike alone.) To get the 'scalar' implicature, we have to have some contextually salient scale. Often, certain specific linguistic expressions, such as (some, all), (bad, good), or numerals provides such scales, and 'generalized scalar implicature' is derived[6]. But in the particular case we are considering, the 'scalar' implicature is clearly contextually dependent, i.e., the scale have to be supplied by the context. Basically, almost all utterances can have the 'scalar' implicature when they are placed in appropriate contexts. But how easily we can think of the appropriate scale varies. For (1,b) and its conditional interpretation, we can think of such scale rather easily, i.e., the scale in relative easiness of various means for getting there. For example, bike is easier than walking, car is easier than bike, and airplane is easier than car, etc. But you call think of a context where this easiness changes the direction, i.e. bike is easier than car, and car is easier than airplane, etc. So the scale itself is totally context dependent. The important point is that this scale of easiness can be set based on the conditional interpretation of (1,b). We have an inference pattern according to its conditional interpretation shown in (38).","(I use a bike) \"--*e~n (I get there) (38) (I use a car) .... (I get there)","(I use an airplane) --~ean (I get there) This means that the inference pattern of this kind can be made salient by the conditional interpretation of (1,b). That's why the 'scalar' part of the 'minimal restriction' meaning comes with its 'necessity' part. These parts are independently derived from its conditional interpretation. The former is obtained semantically, the latter pragmatically."]},{"title":"5.4 The Interpretive Procedure: The Whole Picture","paragraphs":["The preceding sections have given an overall picture of the procedure for the interpretations of sentences involving duke. We believe that our account is more effective and exhaustive than previous ones. First, for p-duke-sentences, we get the 'absolute restriction' meaning in their semantics, taking the scope of duke over the whole sentence. For de-duke-sentences in particular, we get the 'absolute restriction' meaning of modalized conditional swhen they have \"possible\" predicates. Second, for duke-p-sentences, we get the different semantic contents from their corresponding p-duke-sentences when certain predicates are involved, due to AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aotrr 1992 2 2 4 PROC.

We started by reviewing some of the previous accounts of this phenomenon and pointed out their difficulties, summarizing our basic hypotheses which cover the semantics and thc pragmatics for these sentences. By taking a closer look at related examples, we demonstrated that both de-phrases and \"possible\" predicates play crucial roles for the difference in available interpretations, suggesting interaction of semantic and pragmatic processes that would explain this difference. Finally, we have presented a general picture of how our interpretive procedure works for these sentences. While most of our observations were restricted to Japanese sentences with dake, our approach can naturally be extended to the corresponding English sentences with only.
