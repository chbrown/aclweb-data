In order to perform this recognition, our tripartite plan-based model of dialogue identifies not only domain and problem-solving actions but also discourse or communicative actions that determine how utterances relate to each other. For this communicative action recognition, we combine information gleaned from a variety of knowledge sources: contextual, linguistic, and world knowledge. The combination of these different knowledge sources enables the recognition of complex communicative actions such as expressing donbt. Although our tripartite model recognizes three different kinds of actions (domain, problem-solving, and discourse), the focus of this paper will be the recognition of discourse actions and how a combination of knowledge sonrces enables us to perform this recognition."]},{"title":"2 Our Tripartite Model","paragraphs":["A number of researchers have contended that a coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one another through some type of structuring rela-tion [Gri75, MT83] or have modeled discourse based on the semantic relationship of individual clauses [Pol86] or groups of clauses [Rei78].

We have developed a plan-based model of dialogue and have incorporated into our model Grosz and Sidner's claim that linguistic, contextual, and world knowledge should be combined in recognizing the role of an utterance in a discourse. .","We contend that at least three kinds of actions, domain, problem-solving, and discourse, should be captured by a model of task-oriented dialogue. Many researchers [A1179, Car87, LAB7, Sid85, GS86] have demonstrated that recognition of domain actions endows a system with the ability to successfnlly address many important and difficult problems in understanding. Several researchers have also in-vestigated the recognition of problem-solving actions [LA87, Ram9I, Wil81]. For example, if a user wants to earn a degree, the user might perform problem-solving actions of 1) evaluating alternative degrees (i.e., the user might decide whether a BS or a BA is more desirable), 2) instantiating the type of degree to be earned, and 3) building a plan for performing the domain action of earning the selected degree.","Carberry [Car89] points out the importance of recognizing discourse actions, the communicative actions that speakers perform iu making an utterance (e.g., asking a question, providing baekgrouml information, or expressing surprise).

These beliefs can then be used in understanding subsequent utterances. 3.2 Contextual Knowledge","Each new utterance must be interpreted with respect to the existing dialogue context [GS86, Car87]. This process requires contextual knowledge, which our system captures with the use of the DM, a focus of attention which designates the most salient .action on each level of the DM, and focusing heuristics which suggest the most coherent continuation of the dialogue. For example, on the discourse level, utterances that contribute to the currently focused action are more expected, and thus more coherent, than utterances that contribute to an ancestor that is further removed from the focus of attention. This contextual knowledge creates expectations that help determine how to interpret new utterances. For example, after a qnestion is asked, the context suggests that acceptance of the question will be pursued (i.e., the listener will ensure that the question is understood, justified, and answerable); then it is expected that the question will be answered.","Because our system does not yet include a plan-ner, we incorporate S2's utterances into the DM in the same way as Sl's have been.

Thus, we have seen that both world knowledge (consisting of a plan library and beliefs about the speaker's beliefs) and contextual knowledge (consisting of the existing DM, the current focus of attention, and focusing heuristics) are required in order to determine what actions a speaker is performing and how these actions relate to the l)revious dialogue. 3.3 Linguistic Knowledge","Linguistic knowledge must also be taken into account in recognizing the actions that a speaker is performing.

While it is at least plausible that, in the mind of the speaker, there is a rule which makes winning a teaching award inconsistent with teaching CS360, interpreting (11) as expressing doubt at (10) seems incorrect. Thus, to prevent such erroneous interpretations, we contend that evidence is needed to recognize discourse actions that capture the relationship between a new utterance and the existing dialogue context.","In our recognition algorithm, evidence may take two forms: 1) world knowledge indicating that tile applicability conditions for an e-action are satisfied, and 2) linguistic evidence from clue words suggesting a partitular discourse action. If the system has evidence that the applicability conditions of an e-action are satisfied, tilen the system will use the knowledge as evidence that this may be the discourse action that the speaker is pursuing. On the other hand, if there is sufficient linguistic knowledge suggesting a particular discourse action, then these applicability conditions should be attributed to the speaker, as long as they are plausible (i.e., if there is nothing in the system's model of the speaker's beliefs to suggest that the applicability conditions are not satisfied). So, if the clue word but is used, then a non-acceptance discourse action such as expressing doubt should be easier to recognize (i.e., silould require less evidence that the applicability conditions hold) than if the clue word is not present.","For example, consider the following, in which there are no clue words in (14a) and (14b), but (14~) contains the clue word but.

(14c) SI: But isn't Dr. Smith the professor who","won the teaching award last year?","Chaining from (14~) could produce an inference path containing an Express-Doubt discourse action. The surface form of (14,) establishes that S1 has an uncertain belief that Dr. Smith is on sabbatical, the first applicability condition for an Express-Doubt action (see Figure 2).s The effect of the question/answer pair in (12) and (13) is that SI believes that $2 thinks that Dr. Smith teaches CS360, tile second applicability condition in all Express-Doubt action. Tile stereo-type mmhl[e contains the belief that professors on sabbatical do not teach, so the system can ascribe to SI the following belief: Vx,y (course(y) A professor(x) A on-sabbatical(x)) ~ ~teachcs(x, y). This belief satisfies tbe third applicability condition (the belief about a rule), and this belief, along with the belief that Dr. Smith is on sabbatical, implies that Dr. Smith is not teacbmg CS360, the fourth applicability condition. Finally, a check of the DM indicates that the proposition eThe first applicability condition is actually an uncertain belief. [LC92] describes our fortnal belief model and how belief strengths are represented in recipes and in our belief model. that Dr. Smith teaches CS360 is in focus, the last applicability condition. Therefore, since there is evidence for the applicability conditions of the Express-Doubt action, and since focusing heuristics suggest that this is a coherent discourse action (although not the most preferred), (14a) is recognized as expressing doubt at S2's answer, that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360.","If the dialogue included (14b) or (14c) instead of (14a), some of the same evidence would exist. Ill both (14b) and (14c), the system believes l) that S1 believes that Dr. Smitll won the teaching award last year (though S1 is not sure of this), 2) that S1 believes tlmt $2 thinks that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360, and 3) that the proposition that Dr. Smith teaches CS360 is in focus. Thus, some of the applicability conditions for expressing doubt at Dr. Smith teaching CS360 hold. However, tim system has no knowledge for tile crucial implication that determines how this utterance relates to tile preceding dialogue; the system has no evidence that S1 believes that winning a teaching award implies that Dr. Smith is not teaching CS360. Therefore, (14b) is not interpreted as an expression of doubt at the response in (13), and other discourse acts are considered. The presence of the clue word in (14e), however, strongly suggests an Express-Doubt discourse act and thus less evidence is needed to recognize it; that is, the system does not need explicit evidence that S1 holds the requisite beliefs but only needs to be able to plan-sibly ascribe them to SI. Therefore, since mlr model call plausibly ascribe to S1 belief in the implication that Dr. Smith winning a teaching award implies that Dr. Smith is not teaching CS360, the system will recognize (14~) and (14c) as expressions of doubt, using evidence from linguistic knowledge for (14~) aml from world knowledge for (14o).","Thus, we want our system to use linguistic knowledge when present, world knowledge when present, and both when possible. Onr algorithm for processing is tim following: from the semantic representation of the utterance, infer sequences of actions (inference paths) using plan inference roles. If the applicability conditions for any of these actions are im-plausible, reject the inference. For actions which are not e-actions, tentatively ascribe the beliefs in the applicability comlitions.

Lin- [LC92] guistic knowledge suggests certain discourse acts, a speaker's beliefs, and the strength of those beliefs; contextual knowledge suggests the most coherent continuations of the dialogue; and world knowledge provides evidence that the applicability conditions hold for those [MT83] discourse acts that identify the relationship of the current utterance to the discourse as a whole. By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as express- [Po186] ing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to capture the rich structure of task-oriented dialogue.","Grosz and Sidner [GS86] claim that a robust model of understanding must use constraint satisfaction to interpret utterances; that is, when evidence is [Pol90] available from one source, less evidence is needed from other sources. We have partially included their suggestion by using world and linguistic knowledge when contextual knowledge is not sufficient to infer actions for which there must he some evidence. However, we would like to expand our notion of partial evidence [Ram91] to allow evidence from the three knowledge sources to be represented in terms of degree: thus, when world knowledge is overwhelmingly strong, no other knowledge is needed, but when it is very weak, knowledge from other sources will be needed to support the infer-ences not allowed by the weak world knowledge alone."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[A1179] [Car87] [Car89]"]},{"title":"[~ri75]","paragraphs":["James F.
