Introduction","paragraphs":["Shalt2 is a research prototype of a knowledge-based, multi-domain/multi-lingual MT system. It has two predecessors, SHALT [~31 (1982-90) and KBMT-89131 (1987-89), which brought us valuable lessons we reflected in the design and implementation of Shalt2. As a result, Shall2 has been designed and implemented as a symmetric MT system with frame-based conceptual representation. The advantages of a symmetric architecture coupled with a conceptual representation are obvious. First, it allows us to maintain single knowledge sources for both parsing and generation. We can automatically control the coverage and reversibility of these processes. Second, conceptual structures are a desirable interface for representing the meaning of sentences, machine-generated output (such as diagnosis by an expert system), and expressions in graphical languages. AI-baeed approaches can provide powerful in-ference methods for identification of a (semi-)equivalent class of conceptual representations, which corresponds to a paraphrasing capability. Unlike interlingual MT systems, our approach relieves the parser of the burden of generating a unique meaning representation of all equivalent sentences, which becomes harder in proportion to the number of languages the system has to translate. 2.

We will discuss the handling of such ambiguities in Section 3.","2.2 Concept Definitions A set of conceptual primitives is called a Natural Language (NL) class system[hi, and is maintained as an","e It 171 object-oriented knowledge base under l~ram K' . The NL class system consists of a set of constant classes, three meta-classes, and virtual classeo with an exclusive inheritance mechanism discussed below. Each class represcnts a concept in the real world. A class hms zero or more slots, which describe the fillers it may use to represent a compound concept. NL objects are particular instances of NL classes. There are is-a and parl-of relationships defined over the NL classes. For example, (deTclass *insert","(is-a (value *action))","(:agent (sem *human *system))","(:theme (sem *physical-object))","(:goal (sem *location *physical-object))) defines a class *insert with an is-a link to a class *action, and three slots - :agent, :theme, and :goal. The (value ...) facet shows an actual filler of the slot, while the (see ...) facet shows the selectional restrictions on the slot. A class inherits each slot definition from its superclass(on), that is, the fillers of the is-a slot, uuless the slot is redefined. A class can have more than one immediate superclass, but we restrict its inheritance to be exclusive rather than general multiple inheritance. Tilat is, au instance of a claim c~s inherit slot definitions from only one of its imraediate superclaaqes. The idea behind exclusive inheritance is to realize certain identity of verbal and nominal word senses without mixing the slot definitions of both. For example, most verbs have nominal counterparts in a natural language, such as '~insert\" and \"insertion.\" Such a pair usually shares slot definitions (:agent, :tlmmc, and :goal) and selectional restrictions, except that \"insert\" inherits tense, aspect, and modality from its \"verbal\" superclazs but not cardinality, ordinal, and definiteness (that is, the quality of being indefinite or definite) from its \"nominal\" superclazs, although these features are inherited by \"insertion.\" The following class definitions (defclass *physical-action","(is-a (value *predicate))) (defclass *mental-object","(is-a (value *object))) (defclass *action","(in-u (value *physical-action","*mental-object) ) ) allow every instance of subclasses of *action to inherit slot definitions from either *physical-action or *mental-object. Exclusive inheritance also contributes to performance improvement of the parser since it allows us to reduce the number of possible superclasses from an exponential number to a linear number. There are three recta-classes in NL classes - *vat, *set, and *fun - to represent concepts that are not in-eluded in the normal class hierarchy. The first, *vat, is a variable that ranges over a set of NL classes, which are constants. Pronouns and question words in natural languages usually carry this kind of incomplete concept. The second, *set, is a set constructor that can represent a coordinated structure in natural languages. The third, *fun, is a function from NL objects to NL objects. It captures the meaning of a so-called sentiofunction word. For example, in some usages, the verb \"take\" does not really indicate any specific action until it gets an argument such as \"a walk,\" \"a rest,\" \"a look.\" It is therefore well characterized as a function. Since we allow only exclusive inheritance, the NL class system certainly lacks the ability to organize classe~ front various viewpoints, unlike ordinary multipie inheritance. Virtual classes are therefore introduced to compensate for this inability. I~br example, (de~velass *option","(dsf (*math-coprocessor","*hard-disk *software))) (ds£vclass *male-thing","(dsf (equal :sex *male))) shows two types of virtual classe, *option and *malething. The *option consists of the classes *mathcoprocessor, *hard-disk, and *software. The *malething is a class that includes instances of any class with the :sex slot filled with *male. Note that the maintainability of a class hierarchy drastically declines if we allow classes such as *option to be \"actual\" rather than virtual, as we will have many is-a links from anything that could be an option. The second type of virtual class helps incorporate an-called semantic features into the NL class system. Existin~ machine-readable dictionaries (for example, LDOCEt el) often have entries with semantic features such as HUMAN, LIQUID, and VF~ HICLE that may not fit into a given ontological class hierarchy.

The word senses in the SHALT dictionary (about 100,000 entries) and the LDOCE (about 55,000 entries) have been gradually incorporated into the NL class system.","2.3 Mapping Rules Mapping rules define lexlcal and structural correspondences between syntactic and conceptual representations.

These structural mappings are specific to this instance. The"]},{"title":"structural","paragraphs":["mapping rule","(emap *physical-action <=s=> (:mood =syn (MOOD)) (:time =syn (TENSE))) specifies that the conceptual slots :mood and :time map to or from the grammatical roles MOOD and TENSE, respectively. Unlike the structural mapping in a lexical mapping rule, these slot mappings can be inherited by any instance of a subclass of *physical-action. The *insert instance defined above, for example, can inherit these :mood and :time mappings. Given a dependency structure (DS), mapping rules work as distributed constraints on the nodes and arcs in the DS in such a way that a conceptual representation R is au image of the DS iff R is the minimal representation satisfying all the lexical and structural mappings associated with each node and arc. On the other hand, given a conceptual representation K, mapping rules work inversely as constraints on 1% to define a minimal DS that can be mapped to 1%. Thus, assuming that lexieal mapping rules are similarly provided for nouns (diskette and drive) and feature values (imp, pros, and so on), we will have the conceptual representation~ ~Conceptual representation of a sentence consists of instances of classes. We use a hyphen and a number following ~ c|a~s name (*insert-l, *imp-l, ...) when it is necessaxy to show instaJlces explicitly. Otherwise, we idtntlfy class na~nes and instance names.

An adjective in English might be a eonjugable verb in translation. These differences result in added/missing information in the corresponding representations. The conceptual paraphrasing rules describe such equivalence and seml-equivalence among conceptual representations. These rules are sensitive to the target language, but not to the source language, since the definition of equivalence among conceptual representations depends on the cultural and pragmatic background of the language in which a translation has to be expressed. An example of a paraphrasing rule is (oquiv (*equal (:agent (*X (:hUm (*V))))","(:theme (*Y/*porson","(:def *indef)","(:sum (*W)))))","(*Z/*ac%ion (:agent (*X) (:num (*V))))","(such-that (humanization *Z *Y)","(sibling *V *W))) where *Y/*person specifies *Y to be an instance of any subclass of *person, *equal is roughly the verb \"be,\""]},{"title":"humanization","paragraphs":["is a relation that holds for pairs such ms (*singer, *sing) and (*swimmer, *swim), and"]},{"title":"sibling","paragraphs":["holds for two instances of the same class.

Note that *good has lexical mappings to the adjective \"good\" and the adverb \"well.\"","2.5 Case Base A case base is a set of DSs with no syntactic/semantic ambiguities. A conceptual representation for a DS can be computed by a top-down algorithm that recursively tries to combine an instance mapped from the root node of a DS with an instance of each of its subtrees. The arc from the node to a subtree deternfiues the conceptual slot name. We have already built a case base that includes about 30,000 sentences from the IBM Dictionary of ACRES DE COLING-92.

The sentences in the LDOCE define word senses or show sample usages of each entry. Though composed of a limited vocabulary, they are often syntactically/semantically ambiguous and it is time-consuming for users to build the case base completely manually. Therefore, the Shalt2 parser is used to develop the case base. Starting with a small, manually crafted \"core\" ease base, e~ch new sentence is analyzed and disambiguated by the parser to generate a DS, which is corrected or otodified by the user and then added to the case base.

Pm'ser The Shall2 parser first generates a DS with packed structural ambiguities for a given inlmt sentence. It actually calls a PEG parser or 'lbmita's LR-parser [12] for PUG, and then calls a DS converter to map a PEG parse tree or a PUG feature structurc~ to a DS. Next, mapping rules arc applied to the DS so that lexical and structural mappings are associated with each node and arc in the DS.

Finally, the case base provides prefo erential knowledge to favor one pair of nodes over all other consistent pairs. The disambiguation process call be summarized as follows:","1. For each conflicting arc in the DS, calculate the \"dlstauce\" [6] between the two nodes in the arc by using a case base.","2. Leave tile ,xrc with the minimal distance and eliminate all the other conflicting arcs. Each NL object associated with a matching node in the case base also gives a higher preference to the same class of instance over the other instances in a node.","3. Propagate the deletion of arcs to other nodes and arcs in the DS. Eliminate nodes and arcs that are no longer valid in the DS.","4. Apply the above steps until there are no conflicting arc~ in the DS. The resulting 1)S has 11o structural ambiguity. B.e-madling lexical ambiguities are similarly resolved, because we can also determine which pair of NL objects connected with an arc has the minimal distance in the case base. Our case base for cmnputer manuals would support the \"diskette -PPADJUNCT- drive\" arc and the *hold-1 instance with diskette as its DOBJECT. Therefore, the parser will eventually return (*hold-1","( : ~cheme (*diske~;t e","( : location-in (*drive)) ) ) ) as a disambiguated result. Nagao [e} discusses snore so-phisticated techniques such as scheduling sets of arcs to bc disambiguated, backtracking, and relaaation of case base matching by means of an is-a hierarchy. Finally, a context analyzer is called to resolve auaphora, identity of definitc nouns, and implicit identity between NL objects. It stores the DS in the working space, where references to preceding instances are represented by the links between instances in the DSs. These inter-sentential links are used to determine the scopes of adverbs such as \"also\" and \"only\". For example, if the phrase \"role of an operator\" appears in a text, the word \"operator\" could be a person who operates a machine or a logical operator for computation, but no sufficient information is available to resolve this ambiguity at this moment. In such cases, creating referential links in a forest of DSs could lead us to find evidence for disamblguating these two meanings. The scope of an adverb, such as \"also,\" is determined by identifying repeated NL objects and newly introduced NL objects, where the latter are more likely to fall within the scope of the adverb. The context analyzer uses a similar method to determine lexical ambiguities that were not resolved by the sentence analyzer wlmn the case base failed to provide enough information. ?~We use about 20 of the semantic features described in the LDOCE. The restrictions imposed by the features are rather \"loose,\" and are used to eliminate only unlikely combinations of word senses, Aches DE COL1NG-92.

Concept Mapper Given a conceptual representation, which is an output","paragraphs":["from the parser, and a target language, the concept mapper tries to discover another conceptual represeatation that has a well-defined mapping to a DS while keeping the semantic content as intact as possible. This process is called conceptual transfer. If the given coneeptual representation already has a well-defined mapping to a DS, the concept mapper does nothing and Shalt2 works like an interlingual MT system. It is important that conceptual transfer should be related with the mapping to a DS, because there are generally many conceptual representations with a similar semantic content. The existence of well-defined mapping not only guarantees that the generator can produce a sentence in the target language, but also effectively eliminates unsuccessful paraphrasing. 111 addition to the paraphrasing rules mentioned earlier, the concept mapper uses the following genera] rules for conceptual transferJ The paraphrasing rules are composed to make a complex mapping. * Projection: Map an NL object witha filled slot s to an instance of the same class with the unfilled slot s.
