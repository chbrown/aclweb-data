The proposed method is to compare the raw translation output of an MT system with the final revised version lor the customers, and then compute the editing efforts required to convert the raw translation to the final version. In contrast to the other prolx)sals, the evaluatiral process can he (lone quickly and automatically. Itence, it can provide a quick response on any system change. A system designer can thus quickly lind the advantages or faults of a particular performance-improving strategy aml improve system performance dynamieally. Application of such a measure to improve the system performance on-line on a parameterized and feedback-controlled system will be demonstrated. Furthermore, because the revised versiou is used directly as a reference, tile perfoInunice lneasnre can reflect tile real quality gap between the system performance and customer expectation. A system designer can thus concentrate on practically impo~ult topics rather than ml theoretically interesting issues."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["There are several reasons performance measure is required while building machine translation systems. (1). Potential customers need to be able to compare the performance of different systems. (2). System designers would like to keep abreast of the current system performauce, and make sure the system keeps on improving, not subject to tbeflip-flop problem. (The flip-flop problem is caused when system designers try to fix soore problem of the system without a thorough test. While that problem is solved, other problems may pop up. This kind of problem becomes more serious when the system scales up.) (3). The measure feedback will highlight correct research direction. (4). In a parameterized system, :~Behavior Design Corporation 2F, 28, R&D Road I1 Science-based Industrial Park llsinchu, \"l~tiwan 3(10, R.O.C. if a quantified cost function is provided, it can be used directly for parameter tuning. Thus. a systematic and standardized approach for performance evaluation and the establishment of a common l~3Stillg I~lse are urgeudy required.","Most conventional approaches evaluate system lx~rfonnance by human inspection and subjective measures. While post-editiug, the post-editors ean provide I~_xlback on the quality of machine translafioo, which then is used for dictionary update and linguistic analyses of errors [Ross 82]. Also, feedback can be obtained from professional translators who annotate carefully on the printouts of raw translation output [Pigo 82]. From human feedback, system designers tend to overtune the system. Another approach, plvposed in [King 901, is Ix) collect the test suites and divide them into two sections: one to look at source language coverage, the other to extanlae translatioual problems. Such an approach can avuid the over-taning problem caused by hnmau feedback. The advantage of human inspection is tbat humans can tlinl)oint the real linguistic pp.thlenls and make corrections, tlowever, there are several disadvantages: (1). It is too costly for human inslw.ction of the translation output quality. To get significant statistics on the real system performance, a large volume of text must be provided. The cost for human inspection is thus extremely high. (2). It will take too Ioug for the results to come out. For this reason and the cost consideration, it can uot be repeated frequently. Therefore, it can not provide a quick suggestion to a system designer when the system is changed or when the domain is 'alerted. For a system that must handle a wide variety of types of text, it fails IX) provide immediate help to adapt to the particular domain or field. (3). It is not easy to achieve consistency and objectiveness. Eveu for the same person, it is very likely that he/she would judge a translation result differently at different time, especially when the evaluation criteria are loosely defined.","Based on the above problems with human inspection, some automatic approaches were proposed to eval-AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAI~S. 23-28 AO~r 1992 4 3 3 PREC. OF COLING-92, NAICrUS, AUG. 23-2g, 1992 uate translation output quality. In [Yu 91], for example, a corpus of 3,200 sentences were collected. Then, some test points are selected by linguists based on the sentences in the corpus. The test points are what linguists think the most impo~mt features for the sentences in the corpus. Each test point is assigned a weight according to its importance in translation. The test points are coded in programs, therefore the testing can be done automatically. The advantage of this approach is that since their criteria are purely linguistic, they can do a very delicate evaluation and find the real linguistics problems involved. However, to acquire significant statistics on the performance, a large corpus is required. Corpus collecting and test points selecting are very time-consuming. Further-more, to achieve high grade in quality with respect to these test points, the system might be over-tuned to the set of particular test points such that they fail to reveal their real performance on a broader domain. The system designer might thus be misled by such a close-test or training-set performance and have an over-optimistically evaluated figure of performance. (See [Devi 82, Chapter 10] for detailed comments on performance evaluation.)","We propose a new quantitative quality measure to evaluate the performance of machine translation systems. The method is to compare the raw translation output of an MT system with the final revised version for the customers, and then the editing efforts required to convert the raw translation to the final version is computed. Compared with the above proposals, the evaluation process can be done quickly and automatically. Moreover, application of such a measure to improve the system performance on-line on a parumeterized and feedhack-controlled system is easy. Finally, since the revised version is used directly as a reference, the performance measure can reflect the real quality gap between the system performance and customer expectation."]},{"title":"2. Performance Evaluation","paragraphs":["Using Bi-Text Corpus 2.1."]},{"title":"Criteria for","paragraphs":["a Good Measure From the above discussion, it is desirable to have a performance measure and a performance evaluation process with the following properties:","[1] low cost: minimal human interference is involved and can be done automatically.","[2] high speed: it can give system designers quick response and immediate help (even on-line, for a parameterized system); it can also provide positive stimulation to the system designer psychologically","[3] exacmess: the difference between customer expectation and real system performance can be reflected.","Because the design goal of a system is to optimize some gain or minimiz~e some cost, a good performance measure is definitely an important factor on the improvement of the system."]},{"title":"2.2. A Distance Measure Approach","paragraphs":["To achieve the goals outlined in the previous section, a quantitative measure is proposed. In our approach, we first establish a bi-text corpus composed of source language sentences and the corresponding target language sentences. The target sentences are the revised version of the raw translation which were post-edited to tailor to the customers' need (for publication). Therefore, the target sentences are what customers really want. Then, we employ a distance measure method to evaluate the minimum distance between the raw translation output and the target sentences in the bi-text corpus. By distance, we mean the editing efforts needed to edit the raw translation output into the revised version. In other words, we would like to know the number of key strokes required to be performed for such editing. The smaller the distance is, the higher the translation output quality is.","The sentence pairs in the bi-text corpus is the source sentence and the target sentence post-edited for the customers. The reason for adopting the revised version text as the measure reference is that even the machine translated texts are error-free judged by system designers, it may not be the final version customers really wanL In general, the system designers, who are aware of the limitation and restriction of an MT system, tend to give loose quality criteria, and thus an overoptimistic evaluation. Human inspection can only achieve correctness and readability, but the acceptability to customers is usually low. We try to offer customers the solution they really need. Thus, every trial to fine-tune the output quality should be directed to fit customers' needs [Chert 91, Wu 91].","This approach has several advantages over other methods: (1) Since the final revised version is used for comparison, it will reflect the real quality gap between the capability of the system and the expectation of the customers. According to oar experience on providing translation services with the ArehTran MTS, for most translation materials, even for manuals or announcement, the final versions are intended for publication, not just for information retrieval. Therefore, traditional quality measures which are graded loosely like 'correct', 'understandable', ... and so on, provides little information on how the system should be tuned. Thus, it's reasonable to adopt the final revised version as the measure reference. (2) Human power is more expansive than computer power. Since this approach involves no human interference, the evaluation cost is fairly low. (3) The current system performance can be reported very soon because of high computer speed. With the quick feedback, more performance improving strategies can be tried out, and thus research efficiency is improved. (4) We can show improvement to raise research morale and excite enthusiasm, for a clear indicator of performance improvement AcrEs DE COLING-92, NA)cr~, 23-28 AOt3\"r 1992 4 3 4 PROC.

(5) Because the final revised version is used as the measure reference, the text can' be classifted into different domains and styles. With the quick feedback, it can help adapt system to different donlains and styles."]},{"title":"2.3. Distance Measure and Weight Assignment","paragraphs":["Four primitive editing operations are defined, namely insertion, deletion, replacement and swap [Wagn 74, Lowr 75]. Since each operation requires different editing el-forts, different weights must be assigned. We assigql the weight according to tile number of key strokes needed for each operation under the most popular editor. For Chinese editing, tile weights we ttssign tot insertion is 5, deletion 1, replacement 5 and swap 6. The deletion operation is the least costly operation for its simplicity. The insertion aurl replacement operations take more efforts including cursor addressing, entering and leaving editing mode. The swap operation needs a little more eftort than insertion and deletion. (The swap cost is defined here to be the cost of one insertion plus one deletion. For a post-editing facility with a special swap editing functkm, the swap cost should be a function of the distance between the characters to be swapped. This cost might be less tiran the cost of one insertion plus one deletion for adjacent words. For tile present, the cost is used for simplicity.)"]},{"title":"2.4.

The problem can be solved with the well-known dynamic programming technique [Bell 57]. Figure I shows a diagram tt)r the dynmnic programming problem. Assanre that R : {ell, c12, ..., el,, } is the raw output sentence composed of m characters ell through c1,,,, and Q = { c21, c~2, ..., c2,, } is the final version sentence composed of n characters c~1 through c2,,.","Ill Figure 1, the big square Ires m x n grids with weight (cost on\" distmlce) associated with eacln edge and diagonal.

Any path along tile edge or diagonal from the Start to tim End represents a sequence of editing operations that changes the raw output sentence Io the final revised sentence, qhe cost incurred for each path is the accumulative weights along the path travelled. The cost/distance of a path stands for the editing eflbrts to make tbe clmnges. Therefore, the minimmn distance path stands ibr the least cost. \"lhe goal is to pick the path with the minimum cost, or shortest distance.","There are three directions to go at each position: right, up or up-right. We can make an analogy between [inding the shortest path and lrerlbrnling the fewest editing operations to convert the raw output sentence into the final version sentence. When we are at the Start i)omt, we have the raw output sentence. If we go right, a deletion operation is performed. If we go upward, an inseltion iS performed. If we go along the diagonal, citlter one of two cases will happen. When ~:rli and c:~j on the two edges of file diagonal arc the same, no operation is per* formed, and no cost is izlctlncd. If, however, they are different, a replacement is performed. When we evanm.. ally reach the End point, we have edited the raw output sentence into the final versiou sentence. The second |lath traversal is required to compute the nmnber of swap operation. If deletion of one character is to be performed, and that character will have to Ire inserted in the following operations, then one deletion and one insertion are rephtced by onc swap operation.

This function directly serves several purposes.","[1] With this performance measure applied to a large bi-text corpus, one can show to the potential customers the current system performance in terms of the editing efforts required to get high quality translation. Furthermore, because the performance measure is an objective measure, it can be used to compare the system performance with other systems bused on the same testing base.","[2] The quick response makes it possible for the system designers and the linguists to get a clear idea about the advantages or faults of a particular strategy or formalism. From the quick feedback of the measarement, one can try different approaches in rather short time. Hence, the research pace will be accelerated rapidly. And the system designers can make sure the system is on the right track.","[3] Psychologically, a clear indicator of performance improvement is the strongest incentive for R&D teams. According to our working experience, the research team members tend to become upset when their ideas can not be fully implemented and justiffed in a reasonable time. With a clear performance indicator and quick response, the team members usually get excited and their morale is raised substantially.","The following case study shows how the quick and automatic performance evaluation method help make decision on some designing issues and highlight research directions. In a recent evaluation run, a bi-text corpus, containing 6,110 English-Chinese sentence pairs are used to evaluate a particular version of the ArehTran English-Chinese MT system. The Chinese sentences are the revised version of the corresponding English sentences, which are to be published us a Chinese technical manual. The revised Chinese sentences are used as the reference for comparison with the unrevised version. The editing effort required to post-edit the unrevised version is then evaluated using the proposed distance measure. It takes only about 30 seconds to get the required measure. The experimental results are shown in Table 3.","At first, we think the editing cost might be too high to get the required high quality, and we suspect that the probabilistic disambiguation mechanism for the analysis module [Chan 92a, Liu 90, Su 88, 89, 91b] might not be properly tuned. So we use an adaptive learning algorithm [Amar 67, Kata 90, Su 91a] to adjust the probabilistic disambiguation modules of the system. Table 4 shows the comparison of the original status of the MTS and its best-tuned case. In the best case, the translation with the least cost is selected.

We thus conclude that more efforts should be concentrated on the transfer and generation phases, and a transfer and generation model that is capable of adaptiug the system to different domains and styles {Chan 92bl is required.

The control of the system is governed by its static knowledge and a dynanfically adjustable parameter set which are used to select the best interpretation among the various ambiguities, or to select the most preferred style in the transfer and generation phases. The probabilistic translation model proposed in [Chert 91] is one such example.

Thus, the main task is to estimate the parameters which characterize the model. Because it is not always possible to acquire sufficient data, particularly for complex language models, the estimated parameters might not be able to characterize the real model Under such circumstances, we can adaptively adjust the estimated parameters according to the error feedback.","In Figure 3, the analysis phase (lexical, syntactic and semantic analyses) of the system is characterized by a set of selection parameters. The input is fed into the lexical analysis phase. The output is generated and acts as the input of transfer phase. In the feedback controlled scheme, a set of revised text, such as the 6,110 Chinese sentences in the previous section, can be used as the reference, and be compared with the translation output of 6,110 sentences. Under the scoring mechanism, the preferred analysis selected may not correspond to the translation with the shortest distance from the reference. Under this circumstance, we can adjust the selection parameters according to the error ~ (the difference between the reference and the system outpu0 iteratively. Through this adaptive learning procedure [Amar 67, Chia 92, Kata 90], the estimated parameters will approach the real parameters very closely. In this way, it will help in ambignity resolution and lexicon selection. Such a system is made possible to automatically fine-tune the system because the performance measure proposed in this paper provides an on-line response to the itemtively changed parameters. 4.2.

(See also the previous section for the transfer score and generation score). The Source NF and Target NF are characterized by a set of selection parameters. By jointly considering the parameters characterizing the Source and Target NF, we can adaptively adjust the parameters from the feedback of both directions just like in the previous section. Also the feedback control will make the parameters be tuned to fit the stylistic characteristics of the revised target sentences. Hence, more natural sentences could be generated and less editing effort could be expected in or-der to get high quality translation. Again, only a quick performance evaluator can make such feedback system practical."]},{"title":"5.","paragraphs":["Conclusion","The need for performance evaluation is rising, for both customers and system designers.
