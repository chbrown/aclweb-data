From a practical point of view, the main problem arising from the introduction of complex constraints is due to the NP-hardness of checking whether a given set of constraints is satisfiable and, in the affirmative case, of generating tile set of minimal models which satisfy thc constraints. Since the NP-hardness of the problem tends to manifest in practical applications in a dra~ matic way there were several proposals of algorithms to minimize this problem [Kas87, ED88, MK91]. However, in our opinion, any practical approach to the problem should rely on apply-ing an exponential satisfaction algorithm as seldom as possible and also, when that cannot be avoided, to reduce as much as possible the size of tile input formulae to which the algorithm is applied. A classical way in which one can reduce the size of input formulae is by factoring, i.e. expressing it as a conjunction of smaller formulae which do not have variables in common. As a matter of fact if instead of checking the satisfiability of a formula of length nk we check the satisfiability of n formulae of size k we are gaining an exponential reduction in time. This strategy is also explored in [MK91]. Another way of reducing the size of input formulae which has been used in CLG implementations [DV89, BDMVg0, DMVglb], and which can be combined with the previous approaches, is to build a partial model of the input formula and to apply the algorithm to the remaining constraints. Since in many cases this is able to do away with all the constraints this also achieves the goal of using the exponential satisfaction algorithm as seldom as possible. This method can also be seen as a generalization of steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm described in [Kas87], while avoiding some of its pitfalls. In this paper we start by showing, by translating to the feature logics context the methods for first order terms introduced in [DMV91a, DMV91b], how the CLG approach to rewriting constraints while constructing a partial model can greatly reduce the size of the original constraints and thus contribute to reduce the cornputational problem. After that will review the notion of factorization for feature logic formulae showing under which conditions it can be done."]},{"title":"2 An example","paragraphs":["From an intuitive point of view, our approach attempts to explore the fact that complex constraints arising from combining descriptions of linguistic objects, tend to take the form of a large conjunction of smaller constraints.

The purpose of this rewriting system is to for-nlalize the rewriting process illustrated in thc previous section. The rules of the rewriting system, whidt are justified by theorems of the logic underlying features structures, have been dcsigncd with the aim of bringing out conjunctions to the top while avoiding more than a linear growth of the size of constraints. Tc~ formalize the rewriting system we will use Feature Logics [Smo89] and its notation. Thus we will use a and b to denote atoms, f to denote a feature name, x and y to denote variables and and t to denote either an atom or a variable. We start by recalling the notion of solved feature clause of [Smo89] which is the feature logic w~rsion of the standard definition of solved form [lier30, Mah88]. A set of formulae C is said to be a solved feature clause if it satisfies the following conditions:","1. every constraint in 6' has one of the following forms: fx-s, fx [, x=s, x~s","2. ifx:-s is in C then x occurs exactly once in C 3. if fx-s and fx-t are in C then s = t","4. iffx I is in C, then C contains no constraint fx-s 5. if x~s is in C, then x ¢ s. Smolka a]so shows that any satisfiable set C of, possibly negated, atomic formulae can be reduced to solved form by using the following simplification rules, which again are the feature logic version of llerbrand's rules for solving sets of equations of first order terms: AcrEs DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aotrr 1992 1 0 9 PROC.

We call a solved feature clause positive iff it includes only constraints of the form fx-s and x-s. We can now make precise the notion of partial model used in the previous section as a positive solved feature clause .£4. Note that the form required for A~ is essentially the one produced by an unification algorithm for feature structures. Given a set of constraints C we say that a feature clause C ~ is a minimal model of C if every model ofC r is a model of C and no proper subset of C ~ satisfies this condition. From Theorem 5.6 of [Smo89] we can conclude that for any C there is a finite uumber of minimal models of C. \"]2he aim of the CLG rewriting system is to produce from a set of constraints Co a partial model .£4 and a smaller set of constraints C such that any minimal model of Co can be obtained by conjoining (i.e. \"unifying\") a minimal model of C with .~ and moreover for any minimal model of C the reunion Ad U C is satisfiable. We start by defining a set of rewriting rules ~ for terms and constraints:","z -*~ t if x='t E 34","b-x ---+~ x-b","fa- t --~ false","fx T~M false if fx-I C 3d","a--b ---*~ false","t- t ~ ~rue","f x-s ~ t-s if f x-I E 34","~true --*~4 false","~false ~ true","~C ~ C"]},{"title":"~(C","paragraphs":["v C') ~.~"]},{"title":"~C","paragraphs":["A ~C' C A true-*~ C C A false -.2~ false C V true---+A~ true C V false -.~,~ C We now define a rewriting system for pairs","(34,17) by first closing C under ---*s~4 and then","using the following rules (M, c u"]},{"title":"{false}) -~ ({rut,e}, ~) (M,Cu {true)) ~ (34,C) (34,c u {~-s}) ~ (34 v {~-s},C) (34,c u {/z-t}) -- (34","paragraphs":["u"]},{"title":"{fz-'-t}, c)","paragraphs":["with the convention that after each application of one of the rewrite rules the new partial model is reduced to solved tbrm and the resulting set of constraints is closed nmler ~M. As in [DMV91a] the rewrite process could be extended to use negated atomic constraints in C. We will now sketch the proof of the claims made above about the rcwriting system. We will first argue that if given an initial set of constraints Co we apply the rewriting system to (~,Co) to obtain {34,C} then Co ( ....... precisely the conjunct of all the constraints in Co) is equivalent to 3.4 UC. As a matter of fact this follows from the fact that each rewrite rule is associated with a similar meta-theorem of l:irst Order Logic and/or the axioms of Feature Logits. As for the other property of the rewriting system, namely that the minimal models of Co are obtained by conjoining NI with those of C, we will only sketch the argument of the proof which follows from the fact that if some minimal model C' of C was inconsistent witl~ .M then, after reducing C to disjunctive form, at least one of the disjunctions s|muld subsume C ~ and thus should be inconsistent with A4 while admiring itself a model. Now, since every atomic formula occurring ill the disjunction already occurcd in C it is possible to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis that C was closed under --~M. To see this we notice that each disjunct in the disjunctive form of C can be regarded as feature clause C'. Now if A4 U C\" was unsatisfiable then some sequence of simplification rules should lead to a clash. Now, noticing that any atomic formula in C\" umst already be present in C, it is easy to check that any sequence of simplification rules would involve only fornmlae from C\" and a clash with a formula in f14 would thus be impossible."]},{"title":"4 On the factorization of feature constraints","paragraphs":["Although tile rewriting system introduced in tile previous section can be seen as a factorization of tile original constraint it is also important, in accordance with tile discussion in the introduction, to further factorizing tile con-Acres DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hOt~T 1992 1 1 0 PgOC.
