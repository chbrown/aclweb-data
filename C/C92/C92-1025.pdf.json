Most of the existing \"Kimmo\" systems developed within this paradigm consist of • linked lexicons stored as annotated letter trees • morphological information on the leaf nodes of trees • transducers that encode morphological alternations","An analysis of an inflected word form is produced by mapping the input form to a sequence of lexical forms through the transducers and by composing some out-put from the annotations on the leaf nodes of the lexical paths that were traversed.","Comprehensive morphological descriptions of this type have been developed for several languages including Finnish, Swedish, Russian, English, Swahili, and Arabic. Although they have several good features, these Kimmo-systems also have some limitations. The ones we want to address in this paper are the following:","(1) Lexical representations tend to be arbitrary. Because it is difficult to write and test two-level systems that map between pairs of radically dissimilar forms, lexical representations in existing two-level analyzers tend to stay close to the surface forms.","This is not a problem for morphologically simple languages like English because, for most words, inflected forms are very similar to the canonical dictionary entry. Except for a small number of irregular verbs and nouns, it is not difficult to create a two-level description for English in which lexical forms coincide with the canonical citation forms found in a dictionary.","However, current analyzers for morphologically more complex languages (Finnish and Russian, for example) are not as satisfying in this respect. In these systems, lexical forms typically contain diacritic markers and special symbols; they are not real words in the language. For example, in Finnish the lexical counterpart of"]},{"title":"otin","paragraphs":["'I took' might be rendered as"]},{"title":"otTallln,","paragraphs":["where T,"]},{"title":"al,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"I1","paragraphs":["are an arbitrary encoding of morphological alternations that determine the allomorphs of the stem and the past tense morpheme.

Because the information about morphological categories is available only on the leaf nodes of the trees, many paths through the structure may have to be tried before the right one is found. Some ways around this problem have been invented (Barton [5]) but in practice their use is limited.","II. Annotated letter trees cannot be minimized. Although letter trees, annotated with morphological information, are a kind of finite-state network, they cannot be minimized because all the information associated with the leaf nodes would get lost when the branching tails are merged.","The approach that we describe in this paper overcomes these problems and allows a representation of morphological information that maps more easily to the representation found in traditional lexicons.

Designing such rules and understanding their interactions is a hard task even with the computational assistance provided by a complete compiler for the two-level formalism (Karttunen et al. [6]).

One of the earliest results of finite-state morphology is the observation PROC.

Although regular relations in general are not closed under intersection, the subclass of relations denoted by standard two-level rules is closed under this operation (Kaplan [9]). Thus fstl and fst2 in Figure 2 may represent either a single two-level rule or the intersection of any number of rules.","When the relationship between lexical and surface forms is complex, the descriptive task of setting up rules that relate the two levels can be simplified by decompos-ing the complex relation to a series of less opaque matches. For efficient recognition and generation, the resulting cascade can be reduced to a single transducer. Although it would be possible in principle to produce the same single transducer directly from two-level rules, we have found many cases in our descriptions of English and French where the composition approach is not only easier but also ACRES DECOLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ô',3T 1992 linguistically more justified.

We can treat the letter tree as a simple finite-state network in which all morphological information is carried on the branches of the tree and not on the leaves.","Taking this idea one step further, we may think of the lexicon as a trivial first stage in a cascade of transducers that maps between the lexical and the surface levels. The second stage is the two-level rule system. In the case of our analyzers for English and French, the rule system starts out with three levels but reduces to two by intersection and composition.

Discussion","paragraphs":["Finite-state morphology tests on the observation that ordinary morphological alternations involve regular relations. This is the basis of the early work by Kaplan and Kay [7] on converting ordered rewrite rules to a cascade of transducers and the parallel transducers of Koskenniemi's two-level model [1]. In recent times the two-level model has been more popular. It has turned out (Karttunen [10]) that parallel two-level constraints are even expressive enough to account for phenomena that require rule ordering in the classical phonological rule formalism. But there is no computational or theoretical reason to insist on two-level descriptions. Because the mathematical properties of rewrite and two-level rules are now well-understood (Kaplan [9], Ritchie [11]), we can compose any n-level description to just two levels. In our work on English and French morphology we came across many instances in which the introduction of an extra level is both practical and linguistically motivated. The case of French compound plurals is a typical example.","Our success in composing the rule system with the lexicon (Stage 4 in Figure 8) is due to a number of fortunate characteristics that morphological alternations and lexicons of natural languages seem to have even though they are not necessary or even probable from a formal point of view. We at least were surprised by some of our results. The most important of these delightful discoveries are:","(1) Small case studies can be misleading. The composition of a rule transducer against a lexicon containing a handful of words is so much larger than the input lexicon that one is tempted to conclude that the method can never succeed on a large scale. However, this blowup seems not to occur when the lexicon is already large.","(2) Intersections and compositions of rule transducers tend to be large, but not nearly as large as they might be. The result of intersecting a few dozen two-level rules may have thousands or tens of thousands of states, but not trillions as the worst case scenario predicts. Many rules tend to apply either in quite similar or in quite different environments. The finite state machinery can represent such patterns without multiplying state sets.","(3) Composition with the lexicons reduces the complexity of rule interactions. It might turn out that the composition of a large lexicon with an even larger rule transducer is bigger than either one of the input structures. In reality, the size of the result seems to be somewhere in the middle. The rules constrain the realization of all possible lexical forms. In the composition, their scope is restricted to just the forms that actually exist in the language. It turns out that this restriction makes the result smaller rather than larger even though the lexicon itself is a very irregular collection of forms.","The fact that it is possible to construct a lexical transducer for the whole language raises interesting theoretical issues. In linguistics it is commonly assumed that lexi-AcrEs BE COLING-92, NANTES, 23.28 AOUT 1992 1 4 6 PROC. OF COLING-92, NN̂TES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 cal entries and the rules for realizing them exist independently from one another. That assumption is, of course, also the starting point of the work that we are reporting about in this paper. The initial separation between the lexicon and the rules is useful in constructing a system for word recognition and generation. The rules are, in a sense, a decomposition of a very complex mapping between lexical and surface forms to a set of simpler relations that we can comprehend and manipulate. But in the construction of the final result individual rules and the distinct lexicon disappear. The rules play no role at all in the actual generation and recognition process. They are needed only for the purpose of enlarging the lexicon, although other acquisition methods can be envisioned. The rules are true generalizations about the two-level lexicon constructed with them but they are not a part of it.","In linguistics the psychological reality of rules is often taken to be established by the observation that a simple listing of all forms would be not only implausible but even impossible, given that the brain must have some storage limitations. The general organization of the system like the one we have described suggests that the role of rules might be quite different. Instead of being essential for the production and comprehension of speech, the rules that linguists are trying to discover may be--if they exist in the mind at all--only secondary reflections on the generalizations that can be encoded in the finite-state lexical structure itself.
