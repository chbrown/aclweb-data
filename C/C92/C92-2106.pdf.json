In language acquisition ill i)artieular, it is still in question whether the faculty is necessary or aot.

The system's task is to find general rules that predict which instance from l)olltain A can at(pear with a certain instal'tee front B, and vice versa.","Rhea accepts as input a [)air of instances i = (a,b). One instance is fronl l)omain A an(1 the other front l)omain B. One pair is given at a time. Rhea is equipped with an internal representation language for each domain, D.4 and De, and has predelined methods to extend the reprosentation languages in case of nee(l. Sindlarities, generalization operations and specialization operations are defined upon ea<,h language. Rhea represents all input pair using these languages and their extensions, anti makes all internal l'et t-resentation D(i) - (1)A(a), De(b)}, which is a pab\" of a representation of\" I)olnain A instan(:e att(I that of a l)omaill H instance. More tha.ll one possible internal representation may exist for one input, but the one found first is stored.","When represelltations are acctHlflulated, R hea is able to find out rules, h tirst sorts intert~al representations into classes based on similarities. Classes nlay or may not overlap. Then Rhea generalizes representations of' each ('lass. This process of <l̀assili('ation and generalizatiol~ is, done oil demand.","When a partial input , (an instan<è frotn l)omain A) is given and its <òtlnterpart b (front l)o nmizl B) is to he predlcte(I, tilt, ntodel first (:las stiles the partial input isle a class N using tlt(' infol'nlalion about a, makes the gelmraLiz;ltion of l)omain |l part ttf all the other reltresentalions ill <']ass :',: and expects one of its spe('ializalions to he b's rt,presentalion l)B(b).","The nmdel [ortns classes so that reF.resentalions in ea(:h (:lass share sortie characteristics.
