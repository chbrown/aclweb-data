In the natural deduction approach, deriving the functor's argument y\\p/q might involve introduction inference steps which discharge additional assumptions p and q occurring peripherally within the relevant subproof. To chart parse the same example, we require firstly the following three edges and require a three element ordering: ordering ( a. b. c) [a, x/(y\\p/q), tl] [b, y/z\\p, t2] [c, z/q, t3] As in KSnig's approach, an 'emit' step is performed on the edge which bears a higher-order type, giving various additions to the chart needed to allow for hypothetical reasoning. Firstly, this gives two new edges, which are assigned new primitive intervals: [d, p, ell [e, q, v2] Some new orderings must be defined to allow these edges to combine. Since the higher-order functor is forward directional, possible arguments for it must occupy non-empty intervals It such that isa_subord(a.H). Hypothetical reasoning with the two new edges is useful only in so far as it contributes to deriving edges that occupy these spans. Hence, the required new orderings are (d.H.e) such that isa_subord(a.H). Such new orderings are most conveniently created by including the following condition on ordcrings. if ordering(P.a.Q.R) and non_empty(Q) ~hen ordering(d.Q, e) In general, such conditions may fire after tile emit step that creates the condition, when other new orderings are created that include the emitting edge's span. The above condition causes new orderings (d.b.e) and (d. b. c. e) to be defined, allowing combinations that yield the following edges: [d.b, y/z, (t2 vl)] It.e, z, (t3 v2)] ['d.b.c.o, y, ((t2 vl)Ct3 v2))] The final thing created by the emit process is the following condition on edges (where I@B represents tambda abstraction over I in B): if Cd.O.e, y, S] and isa_subord(a.O) then [0, y\\p/q, v2@vl@S] This condition has the effect that whenever an edge of a certain form is added to tile chart, another edge of a related form is also added. The condition completes the process of hypothetical reasoning, by syntactically and semantically abstracting over the hypothetical elements ('discharging' them) to derive the function required as argument by the higher order functor. Note that, since the intervals d and a arc unique to the two edges created in the emit process, any edge spanning an interval (d. 13. e) must have involved these two edges in its derivation. The condition 'fires' on the above edge spanning (d.b.c.e) to give the first of tile following edges, which by combination gives the second. This final edge demonstrates the derivability of original goal combination. [b.c, y\\p/q, v2@vl@((t2 vl)(t3 v2))]. [a.b.c, x, (tl v2@vl@((t2 v:t)(t3 v2)))]. We have now seen all the basic ingredients required for handling hypothetical reasoning in the new approach. Figure 1. shows a general (if still somewhat informal) statement of the emit procedure which is called on every edge added to the chart, but which only has an effect when an edge bears a higher-order type.

Fin in any order. 4 In each ease, the procedure simply adds an edge for each required hypothetical element, a condition on orders (to create all required new orderings), and a condition on edges, which fires to produce an edge for the result of hypothetical reasoning, should it succeed. Note that edges produced by such condi~ tions are there only to be argument to some higher order functor, and allowing them combine with other edges as funclov wmdd be unnecessary work. I assume that such edges are marked, and that some mechanism operates to block such combinations, s A slightly modified emit procedure is required to allow for deriving overall combinations that have a functional result type. I will not give a full statement of this procedure, but merely illustrate it. For example, in proving a combination F :¢, y\\p/q, where an ordering Q had been defined for the edges of the types F, emitting the result type y\\p/q would give only a single new ordering (not a condition on orderings), a condition on edges, and two new edges for the hypothetical elements as follows: ordering (a. Q. b) i~ [a.Q.b, y, S] then [~, y\\p/q, v2@(vl@S)] Fa, p, eli I'b, q, v2] That completes description of the new chart metimd for L. A few final comments. Although the method has been described for proving type combinations, it can also be used for parsing word strings, since lexical ambiguity presents no problems. Note that defin-ing a new ordering may enable certain combinations of edges already present in the chart that were not previously allowed, tlowever, simply checking for all edge combinations that the new ordering allows will result in many previous combinations being redone, since new orderings always share some suborderings with previously defined orderings. One way to avoid this problem is to only check for corr~binations allowed by substrings of the new ordering that were not previously suborderings. Concerning the soundness of this method, note that chart derivations can be easily translated into (correct) natural deduction proofs, given a knowledge of","4This notsttion il rather clumsy in that it anpears to mug-Kent the prettence of at lemU otie forward and one backward directional arguinent and also a relative ordering of these argu~ meats, wiles tteither of these impllcationa is intended. A similar point can be made about abstraction8 in the schematic semalltics m~lvna .... wtlvllS, whose order and number will iu fact mitTor that of the corresponding syntactic arguments. A more satisfactory statement of the emit procedure could be made recursively, but tiffs would take up too nmch space. 5An alternative would be not entering 6uclt edgea at all, but instead have a condition on edges that creates tat edge for the restllt of combining the emitting higher-order functor with its implicitly derived argtulteltt, directly. which edges gave rise to which others, i.e. with binary edge combinations corresponding to elimination inferences, and with the creation of an edge by a condition on edges corresponding to some sequence of introduction inferences. In fact, chart derivations all translate to fl-NF proofs, i.e. with introductions always made after any eliminations on tile main branch of any subproof. This observation provides at least art informal indication of the completeness of the method, since ttle mechanisms described should allow for chart derivations corresponding to all possible/~-NF proofs of a given combination, which (as we noted earlier) are fully representative. Another issue is whether the method is minintal in tile sense of allowing only tt single chaxt derivation for each reading of a combination. This is not Bo, given that distinct but equivalent fl-NF proofs of a combination axe possible, due to a second source of equivalence for proofs analogous to y-equivalence of lambda expressions (i.e. that f \"= Ax.f~:). For exanipie, the combination a/(b/c), b/c ==~ a has two fl-NF proofs, one involving 'unnece~axy' hypothetical rea~ soning. However, having equivalent edges represented on the chart, and the undesirable consequences for subsequence derivations, can be avoided by a simple identity check on edge addition, provided that the meaning terms of edges produced by conditions on edges are subject to rt-normalisation. I will finish with some comparisons of the method to that of kSnig (1990, 1991). The importance of KSnig's method tm precursor for the new method cannot be overstated, tlowever, the new approach is, I be-lieve, conceptually much simpler than KSnig's. This is largely due to the use of 'conditions on edges' in the new approach to handle discharge of hypothetical elements, which allows edges to be much simpler objects than in KSnig's approach, where edges instead have to encode the potentially complex information required to allow proper discharge in their 'complex indices'. The complex nature of KSnig's edges considerably obscures the nature of parsing as being simply reasoning about sequences of types, and also makes it difficult to see how the method might be adapted to allow for extensions of L involving additional operators, even ones that have straightforward sequent rules. A second difference of the new method is that orderings that govern the association of edges are explicitly defined. There is a sense m which the multiple intersecting orderings of the new approach can be seen to express the dimensions of the search space addressed in sequent calculus theorem proving, although collaps-ing together the parts of that search space that have common structure, ht K6nig's method, although the elements that belong together in a miniehart are relatively ordered, tt~e attachment of one minichaxt to another is allowed wherever relevant edges can combine (although subject to some constraints preventing infinite looping).

The consequences of this difference for the relative complexity of the two chart methods is at present unknown."]},{"title":"Parsing Modal Extensions","paragraphs":["Various extensions of the basic Lambek calculus have been proposed to overcome some of its limitations as n grammatical approach. Morrill (1989, 1990) suggests a unary operator o, for handling locality constraints on binding and reflexivisation. This has the following inference rules, which make it behave somewhat like necessity in the modal logic $4:","OA A where every undischarged","--OE ~OI assumption is a O-type","A OA I will try to briefly suggest how o may help in handling locality constraints. Boundaries arise where lexieal functors seek a modal argument, i.e. are of the form x/[:ly, the presence of the o making the argument phrase potentially a bounded domain. In addition, all lexical types are of the form Ox, i.e. have a single o as their outermost operator, which allows them to appear embedded within modal domains (c.f. the D! rule's requirement of O-ed assumptions). For example, a lexica] NP might be []np, a transitive verb El(s\\np/np), and a sentence-complement verb like believes type O(s\\np/Os). In a standard flexible CG treatment, extraction is handled by functional abstraction over the position of the missing (i.e. extracted) element. The type of the abstracted element is determined by the type of the higher order lexical type that requires this abstraction, e.g. the relative pronoun type rel/(s/np) abstracts over np. Note that this relative pronoun type cannot extract out of an embedded modal domain, because it abstracts over a bare (i.e. non-modal) np, whose presence would block O1 rule's use in deriving the overall modal constituent. However, a relative pronoun rel/(s/[]np), which abstracts over a modal type Drip, can extract out of an embedded modal domain. Including this operator presents considerable problems for efficient processing. Firstly, it excludes the use of the NF systems devised for the calculus (KSnig, 1989; Hepple, 1990a). As noted above~ spurious ambiguity makes ordinary (i.e. non-normal form) sequent theorem proving of L inefficient. This problem is greatly increased by inclusion of O, largely due to non-determinism for use of the OE rule. 6","6 Conaldrr a sequent S = Ox ! ,l:]x:h..., nXn ::~ x0, where the r~l~ted amquent S s ~ Xl,X2,... ,xn ~ x0 is a theorem. Nondeterminism for use of [[]L] means that there are n{ different paths of inference from S to S t, so that there are at least n! proofs of S for each proof of S I. In fact, interaction of [OLl with other inference ruler means that there is typically many more proofs than this. The new chart method is fairly easily adapted to allow for o, avoiding the non-determinism problem of the sequent system, so that parsing examples with [] is typically only slightly slower than parsing related examples without any Os. Firstly, it is crucial that we can always identify tbe parent edge(s) for some edge (i.e. the immediate edge(s) from which it is derived), and thereby an edge's more distant ancestors. I ignore here the precise details of how this is done. The following chart rule serves in place of the bE rule: if [i, ~I. i] then [i, X, A] For tile combination x/my, O(y/z), Oz =~ x, we would require the following ordering and first three edges. The next three edges then result from the operation of chart rules: ordering(a, b. c) [a, x/~y, tl] [b,"]},{"title":"[](y/z), t2] [e. []z, 13]","paragraphs":["[b, y/z, t2] [e, z, 13] [(b.e), y, (12 13)] To allow completion, we must extend the emit procedure to also take action in cases where the type of an added edge seeks a modal argument. For the case at hand, the emit procedure would create a condition on edges as follows: if [H, y, S] and isa_aubord(a.H) and eheck_modal_hietory([H, y, S]) then [H, []y, S] The procedure check_modal_history used by this condition checks the edge's 'history' to see if it has appropriate ancestors to license the O-introduction step. Recall that the D! rule requires that the undischarged assumptions of the proof to which it applies are all O-types. The corresponding requirement for the chart system is that the edge must have ancestors with ~- types that together span the full width of the edge's span H (i.e. there must be a subset of the edge's an-cestor edges that have [:l-types, and whose spans concatenate to give H). The edge [(b.c), y, (12 13)] satisfies this requirement, and so the condition will fire, allowing the parse to proceed to successful completion, as follows: [(b.c), [.]y, (12 13)] [(a.b.c), x, (tl (t2 13))] More complicated cases arise when an emitted functor seeks an argument type that is both functional and modal. As suggested above, a satisfactory statement of the emit process is best given recursively, but there is not sufficient space here. Hopefully, an example will adequately illustrate the method. Consider what is required in emitting an edge [a, w/([] (x\\y)/z), tl], whose type seeks an argument (O(x\\y)/z, i.e. a function to a modal form of a further functional type.

Indeed, most Lambek parsing work has been based around sequent theorem proving, which might be viewed as antithetical to incremental processing since it fundamentally involves reasoning about complete sequences of types. In fact it is fairly easy to modify the chart method to a|low some extent of incremental processing, i.e. so that scanning left-to-right through an input string (or type sequence), the chart will contain edges assigning types to substrings that would not otherwise receive types (luring parsing, including some for initial substrings of the input.

For example, rules of type raising and composition in Combinatory Catcgorial Grammar (Steedman, 1987; Szabolcsi, 1987) would allow incremental combination of types vp/s, np ::~ vp/(s\\np), not allowed by the present approach. The modified chart method instead allows for the construction of incremental constituents in a manner that most closely relates to tim notion of dependency constituency argued for by Barry & Pickering (1990) (see also Hepple, 1991), although since the modified parser is still a complete parser for L it cannot be viewed as implementing a notion of dependency constituency. 7 Finally, it should be noted that the additional hypothetical reasoning allowed by emit* and combinations involving additional 'incremental constituents' result in many 'spurious' analyses, so that the incremental chart method is in general slower than the non-incremental chart method. Conclusion I have presented a chart parsing method for the Lambek calculus, which I would argue has several advantages over that of KSnig (1990, 1991). Firstly, I be-lieve that it is considerably conceptually clearer than KSnig's method, and more straightforwardly reflects intuitions about the nature of hypothetical reasoning",":'However, some version of a chart parser that used only the kind of hypothetical reasoning allowed by the emit* procedure, and not that of the emit procedure, might well implement a notion of dependency constituency. in proving L combinations. Secondly, the relatively straightforward nature of the system with respect to reasoning about sequences of types should, I believe, make it easier to adapt the method to allow for additional type-forming operators over those already provided in the (product-free) Lambek calculus, particularly where operators have fairly straightforward sequent rules. We have seen how the method can be extended to allow for Morrill's Eloperator. We have also seen how the method may be modified to allow incremental parsing of Lambek grammars."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Barry, G., Hepple, M., Leslie, N. and Morrill, G. 1991.
