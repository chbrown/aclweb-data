Natural languages such as French or English have many ways to express a causal relation.

Being partlenlarly interested in explicitly stated causal information, 1 have studied interproposifional relations introduced by paree que/because and puisque/stnce which are the more specifically causal eonjuuctlons. My approach differs from previous work on causality which was either an attempt to define causal relatiuns in logic ([2] [3] [4]) or the design of AI systems for planning and diagnosis 15]. My research is based on natural language understanding. If one wants to retrieve and exploit causal information coded in NL-texts, a semantic analyser that builds an adequate representation of causal links is needed. The importance of this point has been underestimated. For KALIPSOS, Sowa's Conceptual Graph theory [6\"I has been taken as a target representation model; this model can be interpreted in logical terms, thus allowing deduction. Future research will use these interpretation rules and will exploit extra-lingni~e knowledge for automated reasoning. This subject is not addressed in this paper which focuses on the semantic analysis problem. Part I explains that the main difficulty in representing the semantics of parce clue~because and puisque/since is the anchoring of the causal relation. Parts II and III show how to deal with and represent this ambiguity on both syntactic and argumentative levels. I - Problem To begin with, it should be noted that this research has been done on the French language. The ennjunction since, in English, raises other problems in addition to those raised by puisque in French, but they are not dealt with here. In this paper, since is never used to introduce a temporal relation. Because of lack of space, I have assumed that the reader is familiar with Sowa's Conceptual Graph model and notations [6]. Traditionally, cause is viewed as a two-argument relation. In the CG-model the relation \"X has Y for cause* can be represented as follows (the concepts are written in boxes and the relations in circles): When studying such a relation three tasks have to be performed: the first and second arguments (resp. X and Y) have to be identified and the nature of the CAUSE relation has to be determined. 1- Identifying the first argument ofparee que/becamse and puisque/since relations is trivial because these conjunctions introduce a dearly defined subordinate clause. It would be much more difficult for conjunctions like en effet/actually, done/thus or afnst/so, for instance. 2- Determining the nature of the relation is more complex. A cause can be direct or indirect, es~ntial or incidental, deliberate or accidental, several factors might be involved, and a cause may vary according to the point of view. But this question cannot be solved on purely semantic grounds. The conjunctions I have studied, in partienlar, and natural language, in general, do not make a systematic distinction between these types of causes. I assume that speakers and listeners either make do with a general, basic causal relation or use complementary information about the world. Therefore, in the KALIPSOS project, 1 have chosen not to ~ this question during the text encoding phase but to solve it either during the pragmatic analysis or, if needed, during the question-answering phase (information retrieval process), using extralingnistic knowledge.

The question is to know where to an-chef the causal relation in the main clause graph because this anchor may be ambiguous for two teasons. • Syntactic level Ye veux que men flis l'dpouse parce qu'elle est rtche. I want my son to marry her because she is rich. This statement can be inteqneted in two different ways depending on the context: II Je veux que men ills I~#pouse parce qu'elle est fiche.., aiasf, tl ne sera plus d ma charge. I want my son to marry her because she is rich.., that way I'll no longer have to support him. 12 Je veux que men flis r dpouse paree q~(elle est fiche et pas parce q~il gaime. Les martages d'amour, je n'y erots pas. I want my son to marry her because she is rich and not because he laves her. I dor{t believe in lave matches. This syntactic ambiguity will be analysed in more detail in the second part of this paper. • Argumentative level The Btatement Ha de la flth~e/He has a fever can be considered from two points of view, as a fact or as the ~.akefs action. - Giving the cause of a statement considemt as a fact produces an objective explanation as in: I1 a de la fldvre paree qu'll est malade. He has a fever because he is sick. where the information \"he is sick' answers the question Pourquot a-t-tl de la fldvre?/Why does he have a fever? - Giving the cause of a statement considered as a speaker's action produces a justification, implicating the speaker as in: I1 a de la fldvre puisq~tl est tout rouge/ He has a fever since he is flushedl where the information \"he is flushed\" answers the question Pourqnol dls-tu q~(tl a de la flLh, re?/Why do you say he has a fever? The two intertnetatiom differ with respect to the • peaker's argumentation: either he explains a fact or he justifies himself. This argumentative ambiguity will be explained in the third part of this paper where I shall show how it can be represented in conceptual graph structures containing utterance type concepts. Please note that \"utterance\" is used in the ~nse of the act of uttering, not that which is uttered."]},{"title":"II - Syntactic ambiguity when anchoring causal relations","paragraphs":["(1) Je veux que mon flis g6pouse parce qu~elle est fiche.

Except for the case where the conjunction follows a comma (which rules out the second syntaetle analym), I suggest that the statement is totally ambiguous and that it is impossible to choose between these interpretations o11 syntactic grounds. The parser must deliver two syntactic trees. The semantic analyser, however, must try to choose one reading only. There is no guaranteed determining factor but some dues may combine in favour of one or other interpretation. Three of these clues are shown below: coreferenee of pronouns, temporal correspondence and encyclopedic knowledge. Coreference of pronouns (2) J'al dtt que Pierre partalt parce que ca iat chantatt. I said that Peter was leaving because he felt like It. (3) J'ai dlt que Pierre partatt parce que ca me ehantait, I said that Peter was leaving because l felt like it. Coreference of underlined pronouns favours the narrow scope interpretation for statement (2) and the broad scope one for statement (3). However, no interpretation is really ruled out. Although the definition of precise rules seems difficult and still has to be worked out, 1 think that this coreference is a factor in the cognitive process of natural disambiguation. Temporal correspondence It is useful to remember that an effect cannot precede its cause in time and that this temporal information can be computed. It depends on the choice of tenses, on the aspeetual indications and on the situation characteristics given in the semantic definitions of the verbs. Several models of temporal representation using conceptual graphs have been designed and implemented [7]. The ~mantic analy~-r can u~","information to ~biguate a ~atement. Je pense qu'tl a ma~ parce qu'll y a du foutllis. I think he has eaten becouse there is a mess. The tenses show that the mess comes after the action of eating. Therefore, the mess cannot be the cause of that action and the narrow neope interprt.'tation in ruled out. AcrEs DE COLING-92. NAISZrEs, 23-28 ao0r 1992 8 8 1 PRec. OI; COLING-92, Nr̂, trEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 This criterion based on temporal relations is much easier to implement than the first one. Encyclopedic knowledge J' espdre qu'tl va faire becat Farce que ~b~ranck est en vacanees. I hope the weather will be nice because l:ranck is on vacation. Unless we accept a magic causality of meteorological phenomena, everyone knows that clouds do not de-pend on Frauek's activity. \"llais information rules out the narrow scope interpretation for the above statement. Common sense knowledge may be the most important factor of disambiguation. Sowa's model has tools to enende this kind of knowledge but the relevant information, which is not semantic but pragmarie, must be defined in connection with a specific application. For statement (1) and similar statements the parser must deliver two different analyses. The semantic analyser tries to remove the =tmbigtfity using a set of combined clues. llI - Argumentative ambiguity when anchoring causal relations Suggested representatlou A statement such as (4) I1 est malade pulsq~(tl a de ta fl~vre. He is sfek since he has a fever. cannot be paraphrased by 11 est malade parce qdtl a de la fldvrc. He is sick because he has a fever. which would contradict our basic knowledge of illness and fever, it would be better to paraphrase (4) with one of the following statements: - Je dis (pense, erois, suppose, etc.) qu'tl est malade parce qdtl a de la fldvre. - I say (think, assume, imagine, etc.) he is sick because he has a fever. (meaning He Is sick and I say so because he has a fever.) These paraphrases bring out the speaker's activity which remains implicit in (4). Although there may be different kinds of activity (epistemic, cognitive, speech, etc.) they shall all be considered here as utterances, since the problem I wish to address is that of finding the proper structure to represent causal relations. The above paraphrases show that statement (4) could be represented as follows:","Figure 1. Conceptual graph for \"He h sick since he has a feverF': in lids graph, the concept type of the U-node (utterance) is different from that of the Prop-nodes (proposition). The U-node represenls the speech situation whose dreumetances form the dependency relations. Consequence,~ Several remarks can be made about the suggested representation, 1- Fever is no longer considered as a cause of illness; it causes the speaker's declaration 11 est malade/He is sick. 2- In figure 1, proposition 1 is not in the scope of U as it does not belong to its theme. Actually, as O. Duerot has shown [8], there are two successive utterances in a statement such as (4). This is easily explained if we acknowledge that the information introduced by puisque/since is already known. As a presupposed piece of information it cannot be stated; in the representation I have chosen it cannot be the theme of an utterance. 3- The suggested representation shows that it is necessary to introduce a new type of concept (U) in order to represent the speech situation (which is not a proposition) and the related linguistic phenomena. 1 suggest that this type of concept will enhance the analysis of linguistic phenomena such as modality, temporal relations, reported speech, or any facts dealing with the elreumstanees surrounding an utterance. For instance, let us consider a woman who says to a child: Va darts ta chambrel/Go to your room/ This statement and its context could be represented by the graph shown in figure 2.

AUG. 23-28, 1992 I have shown how puisque/since statements might be represented. I have also argued that it is necessary to introduce a U-type concept (U-node) into the CG-modd so that utterance-related linguistic phenomena can be taken into account. However, in order to represent interpropositional causal links, it must be possible to build the proper representation automatically. Two questions follow: when is it neceessary to have a U-node in the graph of the main danse7 Where should a causal relation be anchored in the modified representation7 U-nodes Any sentence, written, spoken or even reported, is the responsibility of a speaker (at this point, para-graph or text levels are not considered). This leads to a first rule: Rule I: A graph representing a sentence must de-pend on a U-node. Any variation in the speech situation (change in point of view, in assertiveness, etc.) must also be in-dicated. The llst of variations is open but mainly concerns verbs (dire/to say, croire/Zo believe, penser/to think, etc.) which introduce reported speech or a new point of view. Rule 2: Verbs that hltroduce reported speech or a point of view must be defined as an utterance (U-type concept). Figures 3 and 4 give examples of the application of zules 1 and 2. A further analysis of the utterance activity would refine and extend these rules because modality and other linguistic phenomena may interfere. As we are not concerned here by the dis-tinctions between the different kinds of utterance (episternic, belief, etc.) and the interpretation rules associated with them, we have left the modality of U-nodes unresolved.","Figure 3.

Example of the applicatim, of rule 2: straJcture of the dethfilion of to nay (unresolved modality is put in quote~). Anchoring As the representation of the main elaine becomes more complex the number of anchoring po~fi \"bflities increases and it is necessary to determine which ones are legitimate. As already explained above, parce que/because and putsque/slnce differ more by the type of their first argument than the nature of the causal relation. Parce que/becaz~e relations are usually anchored to a proposition whereas putsque/slnce relations are usually anchored to an utterance. Rule 3: A causal relation expressed by puree que/because must be anchored to a propositional node of a conceptual graph. According to this rule, in the statement (5) Je dis qt/il a de la fi~re puree qu'tl eat malade. I say that he has after because he is sick. anchoring can be done in two ways (the statement is syntactically ambiguous) leading to the graphs shown in figures 5 and 6. h=,0","Figure 5.
