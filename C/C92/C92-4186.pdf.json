An existing lexicon that, in addition Io ordinary ]exical entries, contains prototypical cntrips for various non-exclusive paradigms of open-cl~,.ss words, is extended by inferring new lexical entries from texts containing unknown words. This is done by comparing the constraints placed on the unknown words hy the natural language system's grammar with the prototypes and a number of hand-coded phras(, templates specific for each paradigm. Once a sufficient number of observations of the word in different contexts have been made, a lexical entry is constructed for the word by assigning it to one or sew~ral paradigm(s),","Parsing sentences with ullknown words is normally very time-consuming due to the large nmnber of grammatically possible analyses. To cir~ cumvent this problem, other ilhrase templates are extracted automatically from tim gramlnal and domain-specific texts using an explanation based learning method. These templates represent grammatically correct, sentence patterns. When a selltence matches a template, the original I)arsing component can be bypassed, reducing parsing times dramatically."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A persisting trend in unification-based approaches to natural language processing is to incorporate large quantirAes of information in the lexicon, informatio,i that has traditionally resided in the gran,mar rules. Acquiring a lexicon has thus becolne a diflicull and time consuming txsk, even for moderately sized lex ira. In addition to this, an.',' natural language processing system intended for serious applications must include a large lexicon -- several thousands of words or more is commonly considered a minimun~ size which adds even more to the complexity of the lu'oblem. In view Of this, tools for lexical acqusition are not only desirable they become a necessity.

Although interactive tools |or h'xical acquisition greatly simplifies tile task of constructing a lexicon, it. is desirable to go oue step further and fully remow\" the need for user interaction.","One of the first systems that aimed at constructing lexica] entries automatically from raw text was Granger's FOUL-U'P system [Granger 77]. FOUL-UP extended a lexicon by referring restrictions placed on unknown words by instantiating scripts that matched the sentences containing the nnknown words. This I)uilt on a immber of assumptions which in general do nol bold, in particular: that all the information needed to create all entry is contained ill one text: that no nmrphological information is needed; tha~ specific (hand-coded) scripts covering the domain can be made available in advance, hi one of the later approaches to automatic lexical acquisition from raw text, [dacobs ,to Zernik 88] have shown the need to consult a variety of knowledge sources such ~s morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contextual knowledge when determining a new lexical entry.","This paper describes an automatic nlethod to acquire new lexical entries by using analytical learning in coml,inalion wit.h strategies used in an existing interactive tool for lexical acquisition (VEX [Carter 89}). In the process of constructing a lexical entry. the system combines several different sources of information: the underlying NL system (CLE, [Alshawi red.) 92]) will contribute information on syntactically and semantically permissible phrases and on tile rules for inIlectional nmrl)hology. The corpus wilt contrihute information on which of these constructions actually occur. This information is combined with tile the linguistic knowledge encoded in the interactive lexical acquisition tool to infer lexical entries for unknown words m the text.","The rest of Ihe paller is laid out as follows: Section :2 contains information al)out the various elements on which the method is based.

It is intended to be used as a building block in a broad range of applications, e.g. data-b~.se query systems, machine translation systems, text-to-speecb/speech-to-text systems, etc. The object of the CLE is to map certain natural language expressions into appropriate predicates in logical form (or Quasi-Logical Form [Alshawi ,(.: van Eijck 89]). The system is based completely on tmi lication and facilitates a reversible phrase-structure type grammar.","The Swedish Institute of Computer ,'qci(m(e has with support from 8RI generalized the fi'anwwork and developed all equivahmt system for Swedish (the S-CLE, [Gamback & Rayner 92]). The two copies of the CLE have been used together to form a machine translation system [Alshawi et a191]. The S-('LE has a fairly large gramnmr covering most of the common constructions in Swedish. There is a good treatment of inflectional morphology, covering all main inflectional closes of nouns, verbs and adjectives.","The wide range of l)ossihle applications have put severe restrictions on the type of lexicon that can be used. The S-CLE h~ a function-word lexico~J containing about 400 words, including most Swedish pronouns, conjllnctlous, prepositions, determiners, particles and \"special\" verbs. In addition, there is a \"core\" content-word lexicon (with common nouns, verbs and adjectives) and domain specitic h'xica. This part of tbe system is still under development and all these content-word lexica together haw, about 750 entries.","The lexical entries contain information about il~- flectional morphology, syntactic and semantic subcategorization, anti sortal (selectional) restrictions. Information abont the linguistic properties of an entry is represented by complex categories that include a principal category symbol and specifications of constraints on the values of syntactic/semantic features. Such categories also appear in the C.LF,'s grammar and matching and merging of the information encoded in them is carried out by unification during parsing. Two categories can be unified if the constraints on their feature values are compatible","In the actual \"core\" and domain Icxica, this information is kept implicit and represented as pointers to entries in a \"paradigm\" lexicon with a number of words representing basic word usages and inflections. 2.2 The Vocabulary EXpander, VEX In the English CLE, new lexicon entries can be added by tile users with a tool developed for the purpose. q'his lexicon acquisition tool, the Vocabulary EXpander, is fully described in [Carter 89]. In parallel with the development of the S-CLE, a Swedish version of the VEX system was designed [Gamback 92].","VEX allows for the creation of lexical entries by users with knowledge both of a natural language and of a Sl)ecilic application domain, but not of linguistic theory or of tile way lexical entries are represented in the CLE. It presents examl)le sentences to the user and asks lor information on tile grammaticality of the sentences, and for selcctional restrictions on arguments of predicates VEX adopts a copy and edit strategy in colmtrnctiug Icxical entries. It builds on the \"paradigm\" lexicon and sentence patterns, that is, declarative knowledge of the range of sentential contexts ill which the word usages in that lexicon Call OCCUI'.","In the present work we want to investigate to what extent snch creation of lexicon entries can be performed with a minimum of user interaction, lnstead of presenting exaruple sentences to the user we are allowing the program to use a very large text where hopefully unknown words will occur in several ditlbrenl sentence patterns. This strategy will he filrther described i~, the following sections.","First, however, we will define what we mean by the notion of (subcategorization) \"paradigm\". Tile definition we adopt here is based on the one used in [Carter 89], namely that Definition 1 a paradigm zs any minimal non.empty intersection of Icxical entries. Every category in a pa,'adlgm will occur in czaclly the same set of entries in the lexicon as every other category Of auy) in that paradigm. Every ent,y consists of a dis3o2ul union of paradigms.","lh're, we assume that a lexicon can be described in terms of (a small set of) sucb paradigms, relying on ttle fact. that the open-class words exhibit at least approximate regularities) 2.3 The Lexicon Learning system, L 2 Previous experiments in automatic lexical acquistilion at.

The original idea wa.q to start with an empty lexicon, as-suming that the grammar would place restrictions on the words in the sentences sufficient to determine an assignment of lexical categories to them [Rayner el al 88]. This can I)e viewed as solving a set of equations where the words are variables that are Io be assigned lexical categories and the constraints that all sentences parse with respect to the grammar are the equations.","Unfortunately, it proved almost impossit,le to parse sentenees containing several nnknown words. For this reason the scheme was revised in several ways [tlgrmander 88]; instead of starting with an eu/pty lexicon, the starting point bccanw, a lexicon coutaining clnsed-cl;kss words snell ;L~ l)FOllOIlnS~ prepositions and determiners. The system would then at each stage only process sentences that coil rained exactly one unknown word, the hop,, I)eing that tlie words learned from these sentences would reduce the number of unknown words in the other ones. In addition to this, a rnorphologicat component w~s included to guide the assignments. Although the project proved the femsibility of the scheme, it also revealed some of its inherent problems, especially the need for fa.ster parsing methods. 2.4 Explanation-based learning, EBL A problem with all natural language grammars is that they allow a vemt number of possible constructions that very rarely, if ever, occur in real sentences. The application of explanation-based learning ~ (EBL) to natural language processing allows us to reduce tim set of possible analyses and provides a solution to the parsing inefficiency problem mentioned above (Subsection 2.3).","The original idea [Rayner 88] was t.o bypass llOl'- lna] processing and instead use a set of learlled rules that perh)rmed the t.~qks of the normal parsing component, l:ly indexing the learned rules eflicieutly, analysing an input sentence using the learned rules is w~ry much faster than normal processing [Samuelsson & Rayner 9t].
