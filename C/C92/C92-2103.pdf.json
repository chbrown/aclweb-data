Tile algorithm makes use of the concept of generation as slructuT~-driven derivatzon as it is described ill 114, 15, 16]. Most of tile time the algorithm works top-down breadth-first, similar to the gcncrator described ill [7] and [61. Only for thc creation of the final structure tile algorithm works bottonl-Ill), 2 Motivation The algorithm given ill [14] allows to generate fi'om a fltlly specified feature structure, e.g. tile input structure is equal to a structure that would be derived during parsing. For ai)plications otlter than testing a granllnar for overgeneration the equality-condition is too restrictive. The algorithm given in [15] and [16] then Mlows to generate frolu all uuderspceified structure, if there is a fully specified (semantic) predicatc-argontent-structure which is nnt ~dlowed to be extended during generation, e.g. tile l)redicate-argunlent structure must be conqllete and coherent with respect to the target grammar, One of the disadvantages of this algorithm is, that it must be marked for tile generator, which substructure is not allowed to be changed during generation. Further, in certain applications, the condition that there is a partiM feature structure which is complete and coherent with respect to the target grammar might be ,also too restrictive. The generator described in this paper had been deycleped for projects whielt are involved in machine translation. While one of the projects makes use only of syntactic information encoded in a feature structure the other in'eject uses semantic information ~s well. In I)oth cases the inI)ut feature structure for tile generator is at least undersl)eeified with respect to *The work reported here is part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 Sp~chtheo,'etische G~ltndlagen der ('omputerlingu£~tik l For details of the LFe, formalism see (1 b the target grammar, not only for al;omic attribute value pail's but also fro' complex pairs. This means tile gencrator has to introduce information into the given feature structure to get a structure which is valid with l-espect to tile target grtunmm~r. In both projects a similar architecture is used: 2 1. parse a sentellCe and return the feature structure","Fp 2. extrat:t tile inforlnation for the translation from","Fp and build F,j 3. generate fronl F 9 a sentence In such an architecture the creation of Fg is usually independent of the target grammar, in the sense that the creation is not automatically coutroUed by tile target gralnular. In machiuc traaslation the grammars used for parsing and for generation are basically spccilic for tile two single languages one wants to translate between. It is usually desirable to sl)eeify F~ only in ,~s rudimentary and ms general lnauller ;L~; possible. This lueans tile details of how to generate a wdid surface string of tim target language are only known in the target grammar, rather than spelled out ill th\" translation relation. Ill other words, a single grammar G describes only the relation of a surface string of a language L and a feature structure valid for tile grammar G of L. ~trther, a valid feature structure for G will represent only information necessary for L, but not neeessarily information necessary for the lauguage to translate into. For example, a gramlaar fro' German will describe a fl~atttre structure which h,'us information for the tenses past, present, and future, but no information about progressive ms it is required for English. Therefore, ill tile translation German to English the generator has to generate froln a feature structure which might be underspecified with respect to tense information, while ill the translation Englislt to German the generator has to generate from a feature structure which might be overspecified with respect to tense information. ht general, in describing the translation relation between two languages one lta.s to face tile probleuts of interfaces: • Infornmtion is missing and must be derived froin tim target gralnmar, e.g. tile input structure is uuder,~pecified. 2For the re~ons of this architecture see for example [4]. There are also other MT projects like GRADE (see [9], [10]","and [8]) which nl~tke use of a similar architecture. ACRES DE COLING-92. NANTES. 23-28 AOt3T 1992 6 8 6 Prec. oF COLING-92.

Since the input structure FSi,, should be part of the derived structure, the conditions for attribate-valae pairs of the input structure are modified to be able to use the input structure to control the generation process and to bc able to allow overspecification, a • If an attribute A of FSi, is licensed by a defining equation or inequation in the rules of tile grammar which are not explicitly excluded by FSi,, it shouhl be checked that A is actually constnned daring generation.

It depcnds on tbc allplication whether this type of overspecifieatiml is allowed. In ease overspecification is allowed, A and its value are ignored, otherwise it is treated ,as a violation of the coherence condition. As indicated by tile last extension to the coherence and completeness conditions, it depends on the application what kind of input structure is considered to be a valid one for the target gralonlar. Ill case a grammar should he tested for overgeneration a valid input structure is not allowed to be extended tlnriug generation and is not anowed to be ow~rspecifictl. In the case of machine translation the input structure can be considered as a valid one, even it is underspecified. Del)ending on the language pair it might be also apl)ropriate to consider an overspeeified input structure ms valid. 4 The Algorithm The algorithm works on a granmmr tlescription and an input feature structure. The grammar description cuasists of context free rules with annotated feature descriptions. For siml)licity it is assumed that the annotated feature descriptions do not contain disjunctions. A disjunction in a feature description can always be transformed into a disjunction of nodes on the c-structure level. Furthernmre, a siugle ode is a concatenation of terminal and uon-termiual nodes, and for each category C of a grammar the rules for C are treated as one disjunction. aThis mealm, it is not sufficient to require, that the inptlt structure has to Ilnify with a structure derived from the grammar to get a generatim~, since this would allow to produce sentences which do not contain all of the semantics given in the inptll structure as well ms to produce sentences with any kind of possible modifiers the grammar could derive, that is infinile many. Tim algorithm starts witb a current category C~, initialized with the gual category, and a current feature structure FS~, initialized with the input feature structure FSin. The algorithm proceeds as follows: • Match the current feature strncture FS~ with the current category C~ by matehiug FS~ with the feature descriptions FDi of the nodes Ni on the right hand side of tile rule for Cc, where FSc is bound to the mata variable T which deaotates the structure associated with the nlother node C,, on the left hand side. The matching works top-down I)readth-first. During tile match FS~ will lint be nmdified. • Eztend FS,. by the application of a feature description FD. 4.1 Matching The matching of the current feature structure FSe with the current category C~ will always te,'minate. During the matching a structure which is used as a chart and an agenda is built which keeps track of • which structures are already matched with which categories. • whether there occurs a trivial recursion, e.g. given a structure and a category there is a recursion on tile c-structure level which uses the salne structure. • tim use of whicb nodes can be constrained by tim input strncture, and what is tile result, e.g. is the usage of the node excluded or licened by tile input structure. • which nodes are lmrely eontroUed on tile e-structure level, e.g. there it~ no equation for a node which dcnotates the structure of the mother node. Such nodes bare to produce only finite many snhstrings. For each category C ~fll its rules arc considered in parallel, which avoids ally dependency almut the or-dering of the single rules for C. For each node N on the right hand side of C~ the input feature structure is matched with its feature description FD. This match results ill at least one of the following descriptions:","Exclusion: FSc is not coml)atil)le with FD. There-fore the node N will be excluded. Other results of the matching are of no relevance. The exclusion of N excludes those nodes which are part of the same rule as N.","Activation: FD defines a path-value-pair which is already part of FS~, or FD defines a reentrency which already exists ill FSc.","Examination: In FD occurs a reentranee equation where only one of the paths exists ill FS~.

In this case FS~ does not eontroll the oceurcnce of tile substring associated with the node N, and it depends on tile partial c-structure alone given I W the category C~, whether there are tinite ninny substrings described.","Suspension: FD contains equations which allow controll of generation by FS,., but FS,, does not contain enough information to make a (tecision al)out exc[usiolL activation or exatninatiolt. Therefore, the matching of N with FS~ has to he decided later. In case the application forbids introduction of infornmtion into FS~. during gem eration the conditions of suspension will lead to immediate exclusion. Only tile results activation and examination may occure in parallel The result examination causes a further exanfination of the category CN with tile selected (sub)-structure, if they have (lot Mready ()(!eli eXalllined and are not already under exaluillalion. Thus tho matching of a category with a (sub)- structure is performed only once during the matching of the input feature structure with the goal category. This guarantuecs the termination of the matching and is efficient. Since the matching works top-down breadth-first it is llOSSible to detect inconsistencies between the iupttt feature structure and parts of the rules fairly early. From the complete match it is possible to deter: mine the set of these attribute=value pairs, which are part of tile original input structure and which could I)e used either by a defining equation or all incquation. These attribute-value pairs are marked that they have to be used which is an equivalent of adding temporarely constraining equations to the grammar, which guarantee that a maxinmm of ill-formation from the input structure is used for generation. It should be noted, that this step is only necessary, if overspecification of the input structure is allowed. Otherwise all attribute value pairs of the input structure could be marked at star(up that they have to be used during generation. The matching produces a set of IIossible solutions. This makes it possible to distinguish a failure caused by an illegal input structure from the generate-and-test Iiehaviour of the backtracking *nechanism.

In con(flint to the cmue of overspccification this would require repairing either tile input structure or extend-ing tile target gr~.(nlllar. 4.2 Extension Tile extension of FS~ by a feature description FD means, that all information fi'om FD is incorporated into FS,,. Since only non-disjuuctiw~, feature descriptions are cmtsideretl it is not necessary to describe tile treatment of disjunctive information. The only source of alternatives are the rules. These alternatives are treated by backtracking. The selection of alternatives starts with those disjuncts, which do not lead to reeursion. This guarantees that recurs(on is applied oaiy in those ca.ses, where it could be part of tile c-structure to generate. The extension h~t~ several aspects. First, it is made explicit in tile feature structure which attrilmte-value pairs are defined by the grammar, and how often a definition h~u oceured during tile generation. The latter information is used to stop the generation from infinite loolis I)y giving a maximum amonnt of repeated definitions of the same l)ieee of information. Reason-able limits are values between 10 and 20. It should be noted that the semantic foT~ns of LFG reduce this linfit to 1 for attributes which take a semantic for((( as value 5. Second, a partial representation of the e-strncture is built in parallel to the feature structure, which allows at the end of the generation process to extract the surface string by a traversal of the complete c-structure. Third, it can be deternfined which attribute-value pairs have been introduced into the original structure. Only these attrilmte-value pairs are relevant to reexamine suspended nodes. SFor LFG grammars this aspect of semantic forms is the main reason that tile generation will terminate without the superficial limltati!m of repeated definitions.

For more detailed examples especially on the treatment of recursion see [5]. 7 The exantple makes nse of the grammax in figure 1 to generate a German sentence with a simple NP and all intransitive verb. The grammar is written ill a usual LFG notation. The input feature structure for generatiun is given in figure 2. For the example it is assumed that the feature stucture contains the semantic representation of the analysis of the Englisb sentence the man is running which should be translated into German, The goal category for generation is S. The generation starts with the matching of S with FSo. The NP node of the right haud side of the S rule is suspended, since there is no attribute SUBJ in the input structure. The trivial equation of the V1 a node immediately leads to the matching of FSo with the category VP. The trivial equation on the V node leads in turn to the matching of the category V with FSo. The existence of (SEM REL) = r~n in FSo 6In this paper infinite loops are only assumed in case the limit of repeated definitions is reached.

Tile problem with free variables for the coherence constraint given in Slficbcr ct al does not occur for the alguritbm l/reseuted in this paper, since it \"always distinguishes between the struetnre and the descril)- tiun of the structurc, and keeps track of which parts of the structure are already derived during generatiun. Since the a[gorithln I)resented here always hmq infurmatiml at)out wlfi(:h parts are from the original input structure and which ones have been added, it is possible to check the coherence couditiuu at any step of the generation process.

The treatment of recursion allows even for infinite many possible generations that the sohttions can I)e presented one by one, e.g. the generator will not go into an infinite loop between two solutions. The generator is implicit head-driven, e.g. it selects the head automatically for a given input structure with respect to the target grammar. As it is shown in ACTES DE COLING-92, NAMES, 23-28 Ô~rt ' 1992 6 9 1 PROC. OF COLING-92. NN̂'rEs, AUG. 23-28. 1992 [5] this behaviour of the algorithm allows the efficient trcatment of head-switching phenomenons. It has been shown, that the algorithm provides information which allows in ease of failure to produce debugging information in terms of the target grammar, rather than in terms of the programming language the algorithm is iml)lemented in. The algorithm is implemented in PROLOG in the edinburgh syntax. Currently the implemention of the delmgging meehmfisms is incomplete. Although it is not shown in tiffs paper, the technique used for the generator could be easily adopted for parsing, where the input string takes tile part of the iuput feature structure. Ill this sense tile c-structure is only considered as an auxiliary structure where the gramntar describes basically a relation between a surface string and a feature structure. To adopt tile technique for parsing would have the advantages • to use basically the same maclfinery for parsing and generation where the nmehinery is optimized for each task, • to have the same improved possibilities for debugging, and e to allow to start the parsing of striugs while they are typed in, and not only after the complete string to be parsed is known. One of the major goals for the fi~ture development of the algorithm is to reduce the use of backtracking ,as much as possible by using disjunctions as part of the feature strncture. The algorithm should be also applicable to other grammar formalisms like PATR-II (see [12]) which make use of a context-fl'ee backbone and anotated descriptions. It is also intended to nse tlte algoritlnn for formalisms like ItPSC. References","[11 Joan Bresnan, editor. The Mental Representation of Grammatical Relations.
