That is, • Declarative Frameworks for expressing Bi-lingual Knowledge • Integration of Knowledge-based Processing and Contextual Processing with the Translation pro cess • Effective Exploitation of Domain/'l~xt Type-Specificity (or Sublauguageness) in MT and Discovery Processes for such Specifieities Though new frameworks of MT such as Statistics-based MT (SBMT), F, xample-bascd MT (F, BMT), Analogy-based MT (ABMT), Knowledge-based MT (KBMT) etc. look radically difihrent from conventional liuguisties-based MT (LIIMT) anch as Transfer-based MT, they address role or two of the above focal issues and ignore the rest[7][10]. In particular, the new paradigms of MT tend to ignore t.he first issue ie. declarative representation of bi-lingual knowledge and the complexities involved in the process of combining units of bi-liagual knowledge. It is our contention that any MT system, whichever paradigm it belongs to, has to store a set of translation-equivalent units for a pair of languages and combine these to produce larger units of translation. In EBMT, for example, a set of translation examples has to be stored and several of them have to be combined properly to produce translation. Because of the declarative nature of translation exampies, EBMT inevitably encounters the same complex-itics of combining translation units in declarative representation o.~ I,BMT does. tLescarch in LBMT[1][2][3][ll][12][13] has revealed that dittieulties in tim declarative representation of bi-lingual knowledge stem mainly from the treatment of idiosyncratic structural changes caused by lexieal items, and interactions of such idiosyncratic structural changes when they co-exist in single sentences. These type of structural changes also cause problems when they are combined with general or ordinary linguistic phenomena soeh as coordination. A formal framework to cope with these matters is essential in other aPl)roaches, such as EBMT, as in LBMT, if the translation is produced in a compositional way. In this paper, we discuss problems caused by such interaction, and give solutions in our logic-based transfer framework[8]. Our transfer model views the transfer process as deduction; it produces the target linguistic description without changing the source description. This giw:s a clear contrast to the conven-tional tree-traasducer model, which gradually tranS-forms the source description, and is therefore hard to control. Because of the logic oriented nature of our framework, it can also be extended easily to cope with the other local issue of MT such as the integration of knowledge-based processing with translation[4]."]},{"title":"2 Formalism","paragraphs":["We use a simple formalism, representing a sentence as a network of semantic dependencies.

It can be seen that the representation includes the names of the concepts, both objects and events, which are mentioned in the sentence, aud the semantic relationships between them. Each of the three indices, j, m and e, is a unique label given to a node in the dependency network. The indices also serve as discourse referents when the logical form is incorporated into a discourse representation. The root node of the network is specified at the beginning of the representation, in tiffs ease e, the node representing the seeing event. In terms of discourse representation theory, e is tim discourse referent of which the logical form is a description. As long as the root node of the network is specified, it is possible to convert a logical form mechanistically into a structured representation such as a dependency graph or a feature structure such as tense : past subject : [predicate : john] object : [predicate : mary] Some other examples of logical forms are shown in figure 1. The particular characteristics of the formalism -- the types of relations and predicates used and the manner of their use -- are justified elsewhere[9]. We only state here that tbe forrualism can treat the phenomena which are treated by tradi-tional formalisms, along with additional phenomena relating to discourse structure and lexical semantics."]},{"title":"3 Transfer","paragraphs":["We follow the standard division of a machine translation system into stages of analysis, transfer, and generation. The parts of the system include algorithms for analysis, transfer, and generation, descriptions of the strneture of individual languages (used by the analysis and generation algorithm.s), and descriptions of equivalence relationships between pairs of languages (used by the transfer algorithm). It is a requirement for the transfer description that it should state all and only the equivalence relationships between expressions of a pair of languages. It should contain no general linguistic information, eltiler universal or specific to any single language: these types of information belong ill the formalism and content, respectively, of the descriptions of individual languages. In fact most of our transfer descriptions consist of direct equivalences between predicates or groups of predicates of the language pair. A transfer rule shows a particular translation equivalence between two languages. It consists of three parts: a pair of logical forms, one for each language, representing tile equivalence, and a third logical form giving the conditions under which the equivalence is applicable. We call these the equiva~ lenee pair and the condition respectively. Two logical forms form an equivalence pair if the natural language expressions they represent have overlapping denotations (using 'denotation' in a very broad sense to encompass not only the referential possibilities of nouns but the possibility in general of applying a predicate to a particular index). The rule can therefore be used for translating in either direction: the two logical forcers of the eqnivalenee pair are always translation-ally equivalent if the condition is satisfied. The logical forms of the equivalence pair will be indistinguishable from logical forms of the respective languages, using the same predicates and relations. The logical forms of the condition use meta-predieates which allow reference to to the logical form of the current local translation unit (sentence or clause) and to the linguistic context. In practice, most transfer rules have no condition; they consist just of an eqnivalenee pair.

Transfer is no exception. Transferring a coordinated structure sometimes produces a miserable result due to the accompanying combination of structural changes or the fact that coordinated linguistic objects require different target words for a shared source word. However, few attempts have been reported to formalize this problem. We here divide the problem into two categories: t • Divergence in semantic constraints • Combination of complex transfers The first type of problem occurs when semantic features of the coordinated source words require a source word to be translated into two different target words. A typical example can be seen in translation of the following English sentence into Japanese. (la) Site wears a bat and shoes.","(lb) kanojo-ga boushi-wo kaburi, kutsu-wo she-suhj lmt-ohj wear shoe-obj haku. wear As is understood from its translation, \"wear\" is translated \"kaburu\" or \"haku\" in Japanese, depending on whether its object is something worn on the head or on the foot(or leg). This means that, in this example, coordination of objects in English should be altered to that of verb phrases in Japanese. This type of knowledge for lexical choice is very common in a transfer or bi-lingual dictionary, and plays an essential role in lexical transfer of most current transfer-based MT systems. The problem is that ueither a transfer program or a transfer-rule writer expects such an awkward problem caused by coordination. To translate \"wear\" iuto \"kaburu\" in the above example, n rule writer may usually write the following rule in our notationS: wear(X) ~ kaburu(X) iff obj(X,Y)&HAT(Y) But the condition part of this rule is implicitly expected to be interpreted as follows. wear(X) ~ kaburn(X) iff V Y obj(X,Y)&;HAT(Y) The precise definition may change depending on how the coordinate structure is represented. But the","1 There is eamther type of problem wlfich is baaed on the syntactic differences between coordination constructlom in source arid target languages. For example, \"2 or 3 potuld~\" in English should be trmmlated \"2 pondo ka 3 pondo'(2 poundJ or 3 pounds} in JaF.mlese and \"dwybunt ncn clair\" (2 pounds or 3) in Welsh. (The Welsh expression is used only for a sum of money. Another exists for weight.) This type of problem tlaould alto be solved in transfer, but we do not mention it here. 2In this section, we coltsider translation whose source and target logical forms are on the left and right sides of a trantfer rule. For the sake of simplicity, trmasfer rules hereafter are described as uni-directional ones. AC'TES DE COLING-92. NANqT~. 23-28 Ao~r 1992 6 8 2 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES. AUG. 23-28. 1992 point is that \"wear\" may be trmmlated \"kaburn\" only if all the objects have a feature of being a \"HAT\". A simple transfer algoritlnn, for example, may choose the target word when it finds the first applicable transfer rule for a source word: this algorithm may produce \"boushi-to kutsu-wo kaburu\" for the sentence (la), which memm that tile semantic relation between \"wear\" and \"shoes\" is ignored. There may be another type of transfer algorithm which simply fails beeanse it cannot provide two dilfcrent target words to one identical source word. The second type of the problem occurs when one of the coordinated objects triggers a complex transfer which is described in §3. This type of problem can bc seen in the following translation. lie connnitted nmrder then suicide. kare-ga satsujin-wo okaslfi, jisatsu-shita. he~subj murder-obj conmlit commit-ed suicide This problem is more complicated than the previous one because complex ti'ansfer, in this example \"many-to-one transfer\", causes a structural change. Our simple transfer algorithm mentione<l in tile previous sec-tion may produce a disastrous result for this type of translation. There are several possible solntions to this problem. The simple.st one is that a transfer:rule writer writes all the transfer rules which explicitly describe every possible sub-structure with coordination. This is of course unrealistic. Another solution is to make a transfer program which modifies the transfer result dyuanfically when, tbr example, a source word is given two differeut tar: get words. But such a dynamic modilication of tile result during transfer is against our policy of logic: based transfer, because this means gradual transformation of the source strueturc and therefore transfer cannot be formalized as logical inference."]},{"title":"5.2 'lYansfer with Coordinate Expan-","paragraphs":["sioll 5.2.1 C~xwdlnate Expansion tiereafter we concentrate on a case where coordinated objects of a verb cause the problem, though there is apparently an example where other eases such a.~ \"snbj\" cause the same problem.

This transfer result will be reorganized again into an appropriate representation of coordination in tim target language. But this solution seems inefficient from the computatioual point of view beo ettase caseswhere expansion is uecessary are rare . Unnecessary expansion and reorganization of coordinate structures should be avoided. The strategy wc propose executes coordination expansion only if it is necessary[5]. Figure 2 shows a general view of our modified approach to transfer. Transfer is divided into three phases; in the first phase, logical forms are expanded if expand rnles (explained below) find tim necessity of coordinate expansion. This process continues as long as the necessity remains. In tile second phase, transfer described in previous sections is executed. Fiually, in the third phase, coordilmtion is reorganized if the target language has a more appropriate structure for coordination than tile second phase result. (Consider the translation of (lb).

We assume that expand rules are produced automatically from transfer rules before the actual transfer operation. The simplest way of extracting such a rule refers only one transfer rule at one time. This means that the necessity of expansion can be detected not by creating expand rules but by referring transfer rules in actual transfer phase. But the former approach seems essential if we wish to optimize expansion detection. 5.2.3 Discussion Our coordinate expansion detection works even if a coordinate structure has more than two constituents. What wc have to consider is an appropriate expansion algorithm. For example, in translating (4a), an appropriate expansion should keep coordination of \"shoes\" and \"stockings\", as shown in (4b), he-cause both satisfy a semantic constraint on which the system chooses \"haku\" as the translation of \"wear\". Otherwise reorganizing a coordination in the generation phase is inevitable. 5.2.2 Other examples Expand rules from a transfer rule which involves a structural change are little different in forms to the previous ease. The following are a transfer rule for translating \"commit suicide\" into Japanese and its expand rule.","commit(X)&obj(X,Y)&suicide(Y) --~ jisatsu..suru(X) commit(X)&obj(X,Y)&coord(Y,Y1)&suicide(Y1)& coord(Y,Y2)&Y l#Y2&--,suicide(Y2)","expand(Y,X) Another example is the translation of the English \"HUMAN have ADJ NOUN\" construction into Japanese. The sentence (2E) is translated (2J) using the rule (3). (2E) She has beautiful eyes. (2J) kanojo-no me-ga utsukushii.","aho-poas eye-aubj beautiful","(3) have(H)&subj(H,S)aobj(H,X)&mod(X,U)","poss(X,S)&subj(M,X) iff ItUMAN(S)&PART_OF.BODY(X) (4a) She wears a hat, stockings and shoes. (4b) She wears a hat and wears stockings and shoes. Reorganization of a coordination in the target language does not only occur as outlined in the above case. Since the coordinate expansion is completely separate from the actual transfer process, transfer rules which do not cause problems might be used. There is still a problem to be solved with regard to tile transfer of coordination with \"expansion\"; expansion is not always straightforward. There is often a ease where coordinate expansion is impossible without deep understanding of the sentences, or it is impossible in that it may change their semantic structures. For example, the sentence (5b) cannot be the expansion of (5a) though it seems so at first glance. (5a) I saw a group of men and women. (5b) I saw a group of men and I saw a group of women. The apparent disadvantage of our approach with \"expand rules\" is that a large number of expansion rules might be created. Though it provides an efficient way of detecting the necessity of expansion, it consumes a lot of memory, which will raise an implementation problem. This case is more complicated than the previous ones because the transfer rule refers to two semantic features. Therefore we will get two expand rules, one of which is the following rule. have(X)&subj(X,Y)&coord(Y,Y1)&HUMAN(Y1) & coord(Y,Y2)&Y I#Y2&-,H UMAN(Y2) & obj(X,Z) & rood(Z,_) & PART-OF-BODY(Z)","expand(Y,X) In addition, we need another expand rule which checks another type of coordinate construction.

We also discussed a problem in transferring coordinate structures and presented an extended transfer model with coordinate expansion.

We also have to evaluate our framework by examining a wider range of translation problems. One of our current concerns is to implement our transfer model in a parallel processing framework.
