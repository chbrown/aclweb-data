Introduction","paragraphs":["The use of controlled or simplified languages for text writing is a controversial matter, maiuly because it is felt as an attack of the writer's frecxlom of expression. Still, we see more and more attempts to introduce control and simplification in file text writing process, mostly integrated within intelligent text processing environments and complex NLP appieations such as machine translation (see 2. for an short overview). There are at least two types of motivation that Imve led us and other researchers to pursuing this matter with renewed interesL First, experience with large-scale NLP applications that should be capable of handling a wide rouge of inputs (in our case, the METAL MT system, used for the translation of technical and administrative text.s) has shown that there are limits to fine-tuniug big grammars to handle semi-grammatical or otherwise badly written sentences. The degree of complexity added to an already complex NLP grammar tends to lead to a deterioration of overall translation quality and (where relevant) speed. On the other hand, simple pre-editing tools that e.g. help split up overly long seuteuces into shorter mills (a very mild way of simplifying the inpu 0 have proved to lead to amazing improvements in output quality for the application of METAL in administrative text translation (Deprez 1991). In general, the avoidance of lexical, syntactic and stylistic ambiguities is believed to make machine translation or other NLP applications easier. Second, there is a growing need in international industrial environments for standardizatiou and simplification of written commnnieation; the experience is that the language used in industrial documents such as manuals needs a thorough revision to be used efficiently by both native and (especially) non-native writers and readers. To ensure that the language of technical documents is unambiguous, well-strnctured, economical and easily translatable, controlled language has been thought to be the solution, be it that this solution is The research reported m this paper Itas been funded by Alcatel Bell in the period 1989-1991. often proprietary to a company and hence difficult to access by the NLP re,arch conmamity. In this paper, we report {lit ongoing lesearch and development nf a Cnlltollcd L:nglish graluular for technical documenlatioii (ctmrsl; nlaterlal and systems docunlenlatiou) ill the are+( of telecomnninlcation.

The rnots of Contrnlled English The foundation lot most el the current CE umnnals wa.'-; laid by the Catelpillar Tractm Company (Peoria, Illinois, USA) in the mido1960s. This company (currently still active in the CE field) introduced Caterpillar Fundamental English (CFE), on which two significant derivatives, i.e. Smart's t'lain Euglish PMgram (PEP) and White's International Laugnage l~n Sc~ving and Maintenance (II~SAM) were based. PEI' gave birth to grammars used by Clark, Rnckwell International, and ltyster, while II,SAM can be considered the root of gramntars nscd by AECMA (Ass(v,:iadon EurolC,~enne de Constractears de Mat(.'~ici A(~rospatial), IBM, Rank Xerox, and Ericssmt TelecramuunieaLioas. Nowadays, a ctmsidcrable nnmlr~:l of variants of Cmflrolled English can be |inmd in many corporations. In the USA, Boeing successlnlly uses an elaborate Simplified English Checker (SEC) to control aircraft maintenance reporls (Wojcik ct al, 1990). The Xerox Corporation uses Systran and ALPS in conjunction with a Controlled English input (Kingscott, 1990). In rile UK, Perkins Engiues introduced Pelkins Approved Clear English (PACE) to simplify their publications and to aid translation, whether carried out by conventional or computer-aided methods (Pyre, 1988). At Woll~mn College in Cambridge E. Johnson developed Airspeak and Seaspeak, both restricted languages.

Policespeak is currently being developed to enable fast and accurate communication with the French counterparts when the Channel Tunnel opens in 1993 (Jackson, 1990). In the Netherlands, the BSO/DLT machine-based translation project also benefits from the linguistic confines and standardization of terminology (Van der Korst, 1986). In the French TITUS system, controlled language (\"Langage Documentaire Canonique\") is used to improve machine translation of abstracts of technical papers on textile fabrics (Ducrot 1984).

The Controlled English heritage tree Since the above-mentioned grammars have been adapted to the individual needs of each company, they might - to some extent - differ from one another. Unfortunately, we were not able to get bold of any grammar of the PEP branch. Despite this limitation, three of the above-mentioned grammars, namely AECMA, Ericsson English, and the IBM manual were taken as the starting point from which our research and development in the domain of CE could evolve. 3, Preliminary linguistic study Although our study of 3 CE grammars does not claim to be exhaustive, it does reveal the structural dissimilarities between the AECMA, Ericsson, and IBM grammars. Moreover, it underscores some of the qualities and deficiencies of each manual Concerning spelling, syntax, style, and other information such as completeness and readability. Whereas the English used in all three grammars is good, the grammars differ in structure overtly. The following subsections summarize the study (Lemmens 1989: 10)."]},{"title":"3.1 Spelling","paragraphs":["Spelling word list new words allowed free compounding spelling checker AECMA ERICSSON IBM yes yes yes yes no no no no no no no yes Grid 1 : Spelling As to the lexical organization, all three manuals contain a controlled vocabulary list. In particular, Ericsson English uses a two-level lexicon : Level 1 documents may only contain those lexical items that are marked 1, whereas Level 2 documents can be edited using a more extended vocabulary. In the IBM word list a marginal \"!\" symbol indicates that \"the word has some restriction, either a restriction to one meaning or a caution that the word is not at eight-grade level and should only be used with care.\" Other words are preceded by a marginal \"X\" indicating \"a word to be avoided\". All the words used in the three grammars must conform to the spelling used in the word lists. EE prefers British spelling, whereas AECMA consistently uses American spelling rules as prescribed in the Webster dictionary. Obviously, as they were inspired by individual heritage and international business matters, each of these companies have taken pragmatic decisions that match their internal organization. To check lexical terminology and spelling in its documents, IBM supports its writers by means of three computer-assisted instruction programs : WORD CHECKER II, SPELL 370, and PROOF. The AECMA grammar reveals a remarkable degree of lexical flexibility : \"Besides the words in the dictionary, the writer can also use those words which he decides belong to one of two categories : either Technical Names or Manufacturing Processes\" (AECMA : iv). Nevertheless, controlled rules tell whether or not a term belongs to the field of Technical Words or a Manufacturing Processes. \"Inhouse preferences\" can be \"defined in your company's house rules, or by your editors\" (AECMA : vi). In a controlled grammar, however, you cannot deliberately add new meanings to the vocabulary list, and transfer words from one lexical category to another, e.g. the Ericsson grammar demands that no new lexical items may be listed, unless the Ericsson Standards Department gives permission to do so. Similar authority holds for the IBM DPPG Customer and Service Information. Nevertheless, Ericsson describes a special procedure for using nonlisted words : \"If you need to use a new word that is useful only in a very specialized context, give a definition of the word in EE, in the document that you are writing. If you need to give several definitions in the document, make an alphabetical list of the definitions at the end of the document\" (EE : 8). The IBM grammar restricts the use of new words heavily. Writers can, if really necessary, use X-marked words, provided they have been defined and even illustrated in every line where they might be encountered for the first time, and preferably in a glossary, as well. All three manuals allow noun clusters or compounds, if the number of nouns making up the cluster does not exceed three. Adding prefixes or suffixes to items listed in the lexicon is also not allowed."]},{"title":"3.2 Syntax","paragraphs":["Syntax AECMA ERICSSON IBM verb forms restricted restricted restricted subclause nothing limited very little grammar checker no no no tense distribution nothing nothing nothing linguistic basis weak weak weak descriptive little little little Grid 2 : Syntax AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTI~S, 23-28 AOUT 1992 5 9 6 PROC.

AUt3. 23-28. 1992 As to syntax control, Ericsson English states that \"the two fundamental principles of writing are : the memfing must be clear; the language must be simple\" (EE : 8). Ericsson, AECMA, and IBM control more or less identical grammatical milts, notwithslanding each company has its own way of simplifying syntax. All three grammars control verb torms, but AECMA Simplified English (SE) does not allow either a gerund or a participle. EE only allows gerunds (\"EE uses -ing words ... as nouns to describe activities\") and it \"doe~s not use present participles or the continuous tenses\". IBM in its turn lets file present participle function either as an adjective or as a noun. 3.3 Style Style AECMA ERICSSON IBM punctuation basic nothing basic sentence structure +/- little little paragraph structure basic nothing nothing Grid 3 : Style Next to some elementary rules of imnctuation coutrol, the EE grammar does not lbcus on stylistic control. AECMA Simplified English refers to some panctlmtion, and it discusses sentence length, paragraph length, aml structure. IBM has a speciM Information Developmem Guidelines manual called \"STYLE\". It goes without saying that uniformity of style and layout eahances the overall quality of documents in coutrollext language. 3.4. Miscellaneous Other information AECMA ERICSSON IBM check list no no no completeness no uo no readability +/- ok good Grid 4 : other iutonnatioa At times, one of the three grammars prol×lses .. besides a rule of control - valuable information, which cannot be found ill the other two grammars. The AECMA grammar, for example, instrncts the writer how to change a passive sentence into an active one and states that no verbs should be left out to reduce rite sentence length. In addition, one particular grammar sometimes does not contain a rule of control which file two others have : file Ericsson grammar does not refer to control of articles; AECMA and IBM do not take into accouut subordinate clauses (except for controlling file participial adverbial subclause). Still, although individually focusing on syntax control, all three manuals are incomplete: since EE considers but a few aspects of subordinate clause control, the grammar reveals insufficiency and incompleteness. \"llmre are no satisfactory answers to questions such as : What alxmt gapping and elliptic structures? How about using zero-relative markers and zero-connectives? Are sentential relative clauses allowed? Cau nominal relatives be used? Tire rules of control are vague as, hlr instance, in the EE statement \"A comma divides a sentence into its aatmat compoueuts and makes it easier to read\". What does \"aataral COlnlRrUPAIIIS\" ineau? Numerous examples of rules fllat are not well-defined or vague instructions indubitably cause confusion and lead to grmnmatical ntistakes. 3..~ Collc|llSi()ll First of all, we concluded that \"lhe liuguistic l(madation of these manuals are at times very weak: oversimplifications oth~n lemls to linguistic inaccuracies; frequently linguistic structures are not covered; the instrnctious are at times vagtve ,'rod ambiguous; and ol/en the rules disregard liuguistic reality\" (Lemmens 1989 : ill. Secoudly, in all three graimnars there is a lack of clear distinction between descriptive aud normative principles. There is uo specification whether the s|ructmes to be avoided are uugrannnatical or simply non..coutrolled. Typical of tile three grammars is die nolmative \"IX) not use\" uleaning \"Avoid\". Seldom - if ever - is dlis phrase used to show that the writer should not use a construction becan~ it is ungrammatical. For exanlple, tile rules for distributing \"when\" mid \"if\" do not laention file iucon'eet use of \"when\" in conditional subclauses. Moreover, sometimes descriptive information ntw_.ds to be included, e.g. a list o[ alternative constructious ill connuon English not to be used by the writers.

Consequently, \"... it is not salficient to construct a new grmnmar hy just melting together the three graummrs, as was mentioned earlier. The new grammar should also be linguistically welLfounded, unambiguous, and, where necessary, descriptively adeqmlte\" 0,ennnens 1989 : I1). 4. Organization of the COGRAM project Since the develolnuent ill the Controlled English grammar (C(KIRAM) o as it will be pre~nted in this pallet' - iiiaiuly consisls of two colnlJonelilS, a word list and a grauuuar, a two-dimensional strategy has to be takeu into iu:connt. Ou tile one haud, a lindtod lexical database is being develut~xl. A basic wold list containing 2000 terms has been constituted to Ire nsed in computer-aided language learning exercises. Receudy, this list has been extended to a vocabulary package of approximately 50110 words. Moreover, auother 1000 teehuical Ix:ruls were added to make the eontrulted vocabulary mole complete.

The Controlled Gramnrar (COGRAM) The development of COGRAM bas been partly directexl by a three-fold division into a lexical, syntactic, and stylistic component. Most of the COGRAM rules can be characterized by the following three models : \"Do not use X\", \"Use only X\", and \"Avoid X\". At times \"Do not use X\"-rules are complemented with alternative suggestions. Secondly, the difference between \"Do not use\"orules and \"Avoid\"~rules is fundamental iu COGRAM. \"Do not use\"-rules mean \"You must not use\", whereas the \"Avoid\"orules denote \"Try not to use\". Some cnlcial remarks to be made here are : How is each tylm of rule related to the others? To what extent do they J~ed to complement oue another and how? Unlbrtunately, a dilemma makes an adequate solution even more complicated. On the one hand, from a pedagogic point of view it is not useful to add all nou-controlled lbmrs to complement a \"Use only\"-rule. All grammar rules should be kept as simple as possible. Moreover, file addition of non-controlled torms may cause coufosion on the side of the users; they might he euticed to use non-controlled forms. On the other hand, in view of NLP applications, it is necessary to consider all correct (+) and incon'ect (-) usages to develop a powerful grammar checker. The problems tlmt arise in regard to the modeling of rnles result from tile inability of exactly determining the users' knowledge of non-controlled but correct English, and Controlled English : What should the level of ram-controlled English be before one starc~ mastering COGRAM? In the following sections we will focus on each component in ternls of descriptive approach, linguistic foundations, and structural organization. Each compooent will lie illustrated by a few COGRAM exmuplcs. 5.1 COGRAM : The Icxical component To guarantee that COGRAM would systematically cover all major lexical categories in English, the grammatical division by Leech and Svartvik was taken as a starting point. To create the initial frame of the grammar all ten lexical categories as described in tile Communicative Grammar of English (Leech 1987 : 307) were divided into four major word classes (nouns, main verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and six minor classes (auxiliaries, pronouns, determiners, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjectious). All the rules applying to these categories were methodically brought together into the lexical component. F,x. 1 : Avoid splitting infinitives, unless the emphasis is on rite adverb.","BOM tries t0accurately lJ~ all the subassenthlies. + BOM tries ~all the subassemblies accurately. Ex. 2 : Use short infinitives of regular action verbs.","Make a ohotocoov of the CAD graph. + 2~¢d..OA the CAD graph. Ex. 3 : Use \"a\" before a noun beginning with a consonant sound for non-specific reference. Store all numerical information in database program. + Store all munerical inlormation in a database program. 5.2 COGRAM : The syntactic component Beside the lexical component, a syntactic module, which controls coordination, subordination, tense, and aspect describes Controlled English sentence patterns. It should be mentioned that during the development of the controlled syntax, two computer-assisted writing programs, Grammatik 4 (Reference Software International 1989) and Right Writer (Right Soft Inc. 1987), were analyzed to weigh pros and cons with respect to controlled syntactic patterns. Ex. 4 : Write all instructions in a chronological order.","Press the button on your fight, after you have set the switch to the middle. + Set the switch to the middle. Press the button on yoar righL Ex. 5 : Do not use a participle to introduce an adverbial clause. MIC manufacturing, electroplate the housings. + ~,~,..MIC manufacturing to electroplate the housings. Ex. 6 : Use only because, never since in a subclause of reason.","a DBCS manages the System 12 database, physical storage is transparent to the users. + ~ a DBCS manages the System 12 database, physical storage is transparent to the users. 5.3 COGRAM : The stylistic component The third subsection in the grammar comprises controlled punctuation and layout rules to organize textual material efficiently. Extensive study of Kirkman's manual on punctuation added to the insight into the facilities of style control as well (Kirkman 1983). Ex. 7 : Use a question mark only at the end of a direct question. + Is the component single-sourced or multisource~? Ac:l~s ~l~ COI.ING-92, NA~rES. 23-28 At)(;r 1992 5 9 8 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 Ex. 8 : Do not divide words. Ex. 9 : Expound major tOlfiCS, restrict minra topics. 6. Testint, and evaluating the prototype The prototype version of COGRAM comprised approximately 100 rules. To test file efficieucy of the prototype, we analyzed a technical text sample of 450 lines (Schreurs 1989). Because of its linguistic resemblance with other teChltical text files this ~,gment might be a suitable representation (if the crucial grammatical problems to be discnssed. In the Appendix, we show a short eXCelpt front the uncontrolled base text next to its controlk'xl couaterpa~t~ A preliminary remark involves the seniautics of the terminology. During the revision of the smnple file several incomprehensible terms aud phrases had to Ix: decoded. Since most linguist~ are not technical experts, an irreproachable semantic revision couhl not be guaranteed. This is a semanlic problcm~ aud thus beyond the scope of this lexico-syntactic analysis. Nonetheless, the English of the sample text had been revised ~ thoroughly as possible to test our prototypic yet controlled English grammar. 6.1 Summary of the sample text aaalysis In the ~mple of 187 sentences 452 iuaccuracies wetc traced. This means more thau two errors per ~ntellce on average. Sixty-three percent are Controlled English mistakes, 37 % are common English errors. As to non-controlled English the lexical component reveal:; n noteworthy lack of precision : 17 % of all mistakes art', lexical, another 13 % covers spelling co'ors and incotrcct abbreviations.Concerning Controlled English 17 % nl all inaccuracies pertained to punctuation: overuse of brackets and slashes, lack of clear tahular layouts and imprecise organisation of titles. In additiou, the dispensable use of passive sentences that can easily ix ~, active and the huge amount of wordiness ace other major problems, 6.2 l)iscussioa After examining rite analysis of the sample text throngh the COGRAM prototype, we conclmled that the grammar was still incomplete and uot powelful enough to transform technical prose into fully controlled documents. Ttle results, us shown above, do not reflect the linguistic contents of the docmneut in a realistic way. Obviously, because tile roles of the proUitype were not explicit enough, a lot of conslxnctions that were acceptable in Controlled English were flagged negatively. The rule \"Put a period at the cud of each syntactic unit\", for instance, was not accnrate euongh. 11 led to flagging of all titles, heading, mid subheadings, which obvionsly do not end with a period. Consequently, the number of punctuation mistakes should be considered with can(ion. In general, this test exercise led to better controlled definitions of technical tcrms (the lexical compouent), and to more efficient, clearer and well-illustrated rules (the syntacitc comlxmen0. 7. Au Idgol'ithutic (:ore(trolled grammar After a number of ul~ated versions, the invention and classilication of 150 grammatical rules (COGRAM 1.0 It) could function as a solid inlrastiucture from which a uew stngc in the development toward a grammar and style chc~ker can emerge: the organization of an algorithmic con(foiled grammar (ALCOGRAM). The question to be answered ia regard to the logical organization of the ut'~w grammar is two-fold.

Experiments in style checking of German and Spanish using the METAL analysis grammars and the FrameMaker DTP environment in the context of the Translator's Workbench ESPRIT project (Thurmair 1990a/b) have yielded promising results which we might use as a starting point.

The faulty circuits can be printed out, or alarm can be given to the technician.
