Selkirk (1984) argues that if the premodifier is an argument of the head, then the head can be deaccented. I agree with Selkirk's proposal and argue that what is essential is not whether the premodifier is a grammatical argument of the head noun, but rather, whether it is a 0-complement in lexical conceptual structure. This proposal is evaluated by testing it against a corpus of naturally occurring data. O. introduction It is generally agreed that an utterance can be divided into two parts which are related to the discourse function of the information represented by that utterance. The TOPIC is what the sentence is about and the FOCUS represents a new predication about the topic. This information structure constrains accent placement. For example, 'primary' accent must be within the constituent that represents the focused information. The ability of an accent on a single word to mark a larger phrase as focus is widely recognized. For example in (1) the accent on conservative can mark the phrase redneck conservative as the focused constituent (since (1) can be used to answer the question What was your town like? ). (Accent is indicated by small caps and focus by underlining.) 11 would especially like to thank Jeanette Gundel and Nancy Hedberg for discussions and comments.","(1) My hometown was redneck CObISER-Y_ATI~. (Lia Matera 1988 Smart Money) in (1) focus is represented by a single constituent, but this need not be the case as (2) illustrates.","(2) A: Where's Karl? B: ~ her ~.

For instance, different theories give different answers to the question of whether this relationship is syntactic, semantic, morphological, or pragmatic. There is also disagreement over how large a phrase can be brought into focus by a single accent.","Even for simple constructions the relationship between accent and focus is unclear. In exam~ pies (3)-(7), a MODIFIER + NOUN constituent is focused. Note that in the (a) member of each pair, it is the modifer that receives the accent and in the (b) member of the pair, it is the head noun.","(3) a. Those are CRAWLING things. b.

He argues that within each of these constituents, accent is put on the parr that represents what is 'emphasized or contrasted' with something in the discourse context--the 'interesting part'. This idea has also been proposed by a number of other researchers (see, for example, Schmerling 1976, Gundel 1978, Selkirk 1984, Bolinger 1986, 1989, and Rochemont 1986).

Woman SWIMMER is an appositional compound (similar to helicopter GUNSHIP). Appositional compounds are lists of propositions, and like all lists, the last element of the list typically receives the main accent. Some evidence to support this view that (41a) is appositional is that the prenominal can be separated from the head by a copula as in (42) (42) The swimmer is a woman. Following Booij and van Haffxen (1988) I bdieve that a semantic effect of -er afFzxation is to bind the agent or experiencer in lcs. Thus, the agent role is not available to the representation of woman and that representation must be linked by 0-identification. Other examples of this type include (36) and (37a&b).

(For computational approaches see Charniak (1981), Dorr (1989), and Sowa (1991).) Thus, the rule requires only information that has independent motivation for being in the lexicon.","As Selkirk noted, the same factors that govern accent placement in these constructions also constrain accent in verb phrases and sentences.
