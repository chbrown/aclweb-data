The normalized definite clause grammar is declaratively equivalent to the original definite clause grammar, that is, it assigns the same analyses to the same strings. Offline-parsability of the original grammar is reflected in an elementary textual property of the transformed grammar. When this property holds, a direct (top-down) Prolog implementation of the normalized grammar solves the parsing problem: all solutions are enumerated on backtracking and execution terminates. When specialized to the simpler case of context-free grammars, the GGNF provides a variant to file GNF, where the transformed context-free grammar not only generates the same strings as the original grammar, but also preserves their degrees of ambiguity (this last property does not hold for the GNF). The GGNF seems to be the first normal form result for DCGs. It provides an explicit factorization of the potential sources of uudeeidability for the parsing problem, and offers valuable insights on the computational structure of unification grammars in general."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["From the point of view of decidability, the parsing problem with a definite clause grammar is much more complex than the corresponding problem with a context-free grammar.

See also [4] for a special case of this problem. (Caveat. The notion of \"cycle\" in \"cycle-free\" is technically different from the notion used here, which simply means: cycle in the graph associated with the relation \"callable from\". See note 10.)","2.

Only nonterminal clauses appear in the definite grannnar scheme, but no auxiliary clause; the auxiliary predicates which may appear in the right-hand sides of clauses do not receive a definition. A definite grammar scheme can be seen as an uncompletely specified definite clause grammar, that is, a definite clause granmtar \"lacking\" a definition for the auxiliary predicates {p(Xt ..... X,)} that it \"uses\". The auxiliary predicates are \"free\": the interpretation of p is not fixed a priori, but can be an arbitrarily chosen n-ary relation on a certain Herbrand universe of terms. 7 Example 1 The following clauses define a definite grammar scheme DGSI :s a l(X)--* a3(E), a l(A), a2(B), {q(E,A, B, X)} al(X) ~ [oh],"]},{"title":"{pl(X)}","paragraphs":[".2(X) ~ [dull,"]},{"title":"{p2(X)}","paragraphs":["a3(X) ~ [ ], {p3(X)} In this definite grammar scheme, only variables appear as argutnents; the auxiliary predicates pl, p2, p3 and q do not receive a definition. If a definite program definiug these auxiliary predicates is added to the definite grammar scheme, one obtains a full-fledged definite clause grammar, which can be interpreted in the usual manner. Conversely, every definite clause grammar can be seen as the conjunction of a definite grammar scheme and of a definite clause program. In order to do so, a minor transforntation must be performed: each complex term T appearing as an argument in the head or body of a nonterminal clause must be replaced by a variable X, this variable being implicitly constrained to unify with T through the addition of an ad-hoc unification goal in the body of the clause (see [3]).","rThe domain of interpretation can in fact be any set. Taking it to be the Ilerbrand universe over a certain vocabulary of functional symbols permits to \"simulate\" a DCG, by fixing the interpretation of the free auxiliary predicates in this domain.

This definite grammar scheme is in fact identical with DGSI (see previous example). In the sequel of this paper, we will be interested, not directly in transformations of definite clause grammars, but in transformations of definite grammar schemes. The transformation of a definite grammar scheme DGS into DGS ~ will respect the following conditions: • The auxiliary predicates of DGS and of DGS' are the same; • For any definite clause program P which defines the auxiliary predicates in DGS (and therefore also those in DGSI), the definite clause grammar DCG obtained through the adjunction of P to DGS has the same denotational semantics as the definite clause grammar DCG' obtained through the adjunction of P to DGS j. Under the preceding conditions, DGS and DGS' are stud to be equivalent definite grammar schemes. The grammar Vansformatious thus defined are, in a certain sense, universal transformations:, they are valid independently from the interpretation given to the auxiliary predicates. 2.2 GGNF for definite clause grammars Structure of the GGNF The definite grammar scheme DGS, on the terminal vocabulary V, having Q as its set of auxiliary predicates, is said to be in Generalized Greibach Normal Form if:","1. The nonterminals of DGS are partitioned in three distinct subsets: A = {al}, called the initial set; U, called the set of unit nonterminals; N, called the set of co-unit nonterminals.","2. The rules of DGS are partitioned into three groups of rules, called the factorization group (defining the elements of A), the unit group (defining the elements of U), and the co-unit group (defining the elements of N), graphically presented in the following mannet: factorization rules: definition of the elements of A unit rules: definition of the elements of U co-unit rules: definition of the elements of N","3. Factofization rules are taken among the two following rules: al(Xl ..... X.) --, nl(X1 ..... X,~) ,","and/or: al(Xl,...,Xn) \"~ ul(Xl ..... Xn) , where nl E N and ul E U, and where n E N is the arity of the initial nonterminal al. 4. Unit rules are of the form: u(Xl ..... X,,) --* tl , where u E U is a unit nonterminal of arity m, m E N, and where H is a finite sequence of nonterminal unit goals of U, of auxiliary predicates of Q, or is the empty string []. The group of unit rules forms a subscheme of the GGNF definite grammar scheme (see below). 5. Co-unit rules are of the form: n( Xt , . . . , X~ ) --+ [term] Af , where n E N is a co-unit nonterminal of arity k, k E N. where [term] E V and where .hi is a finite sequence of terminal goals of V, of nonterminal unit goals of U, of auxiliary predicates of Q, or of nonterminal co-unit goals of N.","6.

For this reason, the group of unit roles is called the unit subscheme (or, loosely, the unit subgrammar) of the GGNF definite grammar scheme. • The unit subscheme can only generate the empty string [ ]. The unit subscheme of the GGNF is said to contain a cycle iff there exists a unit nonterminal u(X1, .... X,,~) which \"calls itself recursively\", directly or indirectly, in-side this group./° One can show that this property is equivalent to the fact that the context-free skeleton of DGS is infinitely ambiguous, or, in other words, to the fact that DGS is not offline-parsable [3]. 2.4 'lop-down parsing with the GGNF Let DGS be a definite grammar scheme in GGNF, having Q for its set of auxiliary predicates.

T,,). where 7'1, ... ,Tn can be any terms; In other words, the auxiliary predicates are constrained to be simply unifications. Let DCG be the definite clause grammar obtained through adjunction of these clauses to DGS. The grammar DCG has the following properties:","t°For example, the scheme: t~t(X) ~ u2(g), u3(Z) .... ,,2(x) ~ udY). m(Z) .... contains a cycle in ul • n We use the terminology 'head clause' for a clause without body. A more standard terminology would be 'unit clause', but this would conflict with our technical notion of \"unit' (a nonterminai generating the empty string [ ]). I. If tile unit subscheme does not contain a cycle, then, for arty input string Siring, the standard top-down parsing algorithm terminates, after enumerating all the analyses for Siring;","2. If the unit subscheme contains a cycle, the top-down parsing algorithm can terminate or not, depending on the definition given to the auxiliary predicates. We give below three exmnples of definite grammar schemes, and of the equivalent definite grammar schemes in GGNF. 2.5 Examples Example 3 Consider the definite grammar scheme DGS1 given in Example 1, repeated below: al(X)-~ a3(E), al(A), a2(B), {q(E,A, B,X)} ul(X) ~ [oh], {pl(X)} a2(X) --, [dull, {p2(X)} ~3(x) -, [ j, {p3(x)) The following definite grammar scheme DGS;u is in GGNF and is equivalent to DGSI: al(X) --~ nl(X) ¢ nl(X) --* [oh], {pl(X)} nl(X) --* [dill, {pl(Y)}, h(Y,X) h(Y,X) ~ [dull, {p2(B)}, {p3(E)},","{q(E, Y, I3, X)} h(Y,X)--, [oui], {p2(B)}, {p3(E)},","{q(E, 1I, B, Z)}, h(Z, X) Suppose P is any auxiliary definite program which defines the auxiliary predicates p l,p2,p3, q. Then the definite clause grammars DCGt and DCG2, obtained by adjunction of this program to DGSt and DGS2, respectively, are equivalent. The unit subscheme of DGS~ does not contain a cycle (it is empty12). One can conclude that DCGI, as well as DCG~, are offline-parsable. If, moreover, it is assumed that P defines the auxiliary predicates as being unifications, then it can be concluded that top-down parsing with DCG~ will enumerate all possible analyses for a given string and terminate. For instance, assume that the auxiliary program consists in the following four clauses (see Example 2): pl(nil). p2(f). p3(r). q(E, A, fl, cons(B, A)). 12See note 14.

The most powerful transformation methods existing for context-free grammars are \"algebraic (\"matrix based\" [8]) ones relying on the concepts of formal power series and algebraic systems (see [5, 91). Using such concepts, a context4ree grammar such as: al ~ ala2 I a2 I [] a~ --, [v] is refommlated into the algebraic system: al = ala2+a2+ l a s = [ v ] which represents a fixpoint equation in the variables (or \"nontermitmls\") al,a2 on a certain algebraic structure (a non-commutative semiring) of formal power series Noo<<V'~, where Net is the set of non-negative in-tegers, extended to infinity, hfformally, an element of N,,~<<V'>> represents a language on the vocabulary V (such that [v] E V), where each string in the language is associated with a number, finite or infinite, which can be interpreted as the degree of ambiguity of this string relative to the system (or, equivalently the corresponding CFG).

NANTES, AUG. 23-28. 1992 where \"equals can be replaced by equals\", and (3) they possess a rich algebraic structure (addition, multiplica-tion) which endows them with mathematical perspicuity and power. There are some substantial differences between the transformation steps used to obtain the GGNF of an algebraic system and the standard ones used to obtain its GNF, the principal one lying in the necessity to preserve degrees of ambiguity at each step. In the GNF case, the initial step consists in first transforming the initial system into a proper system (a notion analoguous to that of proper CFG)--an operation which does not preserve degrees of ambiguity--and then performing the main transformation. For this reason, the transformation steps in the GGNF case must be formulated in a more global way, which, among other complications, involves the use of certain identities on regular languages) 9 However, there are also important similarities between the GNF and the GGNF transformations, among them the observation that the elementary algebraic system in the variable a on the vocabulary V = {Iv], It]}: a = a Iv] + [t] has the unique solution a = [t] Iv]*, an observation which can be much generalized, and which plays a central role in both cases. DCGs, Mixed Systems, and the GGNF. In ordcr to define the GGNF in the case of Definite Grammar Schemes (or, equivalently. DCGs), we have introduced so-eallcd mixed systems, a generalization of algebraic systems capable of representing association of structures to strings. Without going into details, let's consider the following definite grammar scheme: ai(x ) -+ al(y)ax(z){p(z,y,z)} I","a~(y) {q(z,y)} I [ ] {r(x)} a2(~:) -+ [vl{s(z)}","This scheme is reformulated as the mixed system: alx = aly a2z IY~ z + a2y qYz + r,: a2~ = [v] s~ In this system, the variables (or nonterminals) at, a~ are seen as functions: /g -~ B<<V*>> (where B is the set of booleans {0, 1}), that is, as functions mapping elements of a set E (often taken to be a Herbrand universe), representing linguistic structures, into formal series of B~V*>>, that is, into languages over V. This can be seen to correspond to the intuitive notion that a nonterminal \"associates\" structures to strings. As for p, q, r, s, they are seen respectively as fonctions from E ~, E ~, E, E into B C B<¢:V*>>, that is, as predicates of different arities over E. The system represents a fixpoint equation on the variables ax, a2, given the constants [v], p, q, r, s. 2° Although mixed systems are defined on more complex structures than are algebraic systems, the transformation methods for algebraic systems generalize without difficuhy to their case, and these methods form the mathematieal basis of the results reported in this paper. l~Such as the identity (e + ])* ~ e*(ye*) °.
