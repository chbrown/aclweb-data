If the conjunctive structures existing in a long sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguities can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed in a high successful rate. Since the prior part and the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a similar structure very often, finding two similar series of words is an essential point in solving this problem. Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and then the two series of words which have the greatest sum of similarities are found by a technique of dynamic programming. We deal with not only conjunctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predicative clauses created by \"Renyoh chuushi-ho\". We will illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the analysis of 180 long Japanese sentences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Analysis of a long Japanese sentence is one of many difficult problems which cannot be solved by the continuing efforts of many researchers and remain abaudoned. It is difficult to get a proper analysis of a sentence whose length is more than fifty Japanese characters, and almost all the analyses fail for sentences composed of more than eighty characters. To clarify why it is is also very difficult because there are varieties of reasons for the failures. People sometimes say that there are so many possibilities of modifier/modifyee relations between phrases in a long sentence. But no deeper consideration has ever been given for the reasons of the analysis failure. Analysis failure here means not only that no correct analysis is included in the multiple analysis results which are caused by the intrinsic ambiguity of a sentence and also by inaccurate grammatical rules, but also that the analysis fails in the middle of the analysis prore88, We have been claiming that many (more than two) linguistic components are to be seen at the same time in a sentence for proper parsing, and also that tree to tree transformation is necessary for reliable analysis of a sentence. Popular grammar rules which merge two linguistic components into one are quite insufficient to describe the delicate relationships among components ill a long sentence. Language is complex. There often happens that components whicb are far apart in a long sentence cooccur, or have certain relationships. Such relations may be sometimes purely semantic, but often they are grammatical or structural, although they are not definite but very subtle. A long sentence, particularly of Japanese, contains parallel structures very often. They are either conjunctive noun phrases, or conjunctive predicative clauses. The latter is called \"Renyoh chuushiho\". They appear in an embedded sentence to modify nouns, and also are used to connect two or more sentences. This form is very often used in Japanese, and is a main cause for structural ambiguity. Many major sentential components are omitted in the posterior part of Renyoh chuushi expressions and this makes the analysis more difficult. For tbc successful analysis of a long Japanese sentence, these parallel phrases and clauses, including Renyoh chuushi-ho, must be recognized correctly. This is a key point, and this must be achieved by a completely different method from the ordinary syntactic analysis methods, because they generally fail in the analysis for a long sentence. We have introduced au assumption that these parallel phrases/clauses have a certain similarity, and have developed an algorithm which finds out a most plausible two series of words which can be considered parallel by calculating a similarity measure of two arbitrary series of words. This is realized by using the dynamic programming method. The results was exceedingly good. We achieved the score of about 80% in the detection of various types of parallel series of words in long Japanese sentences."]},{"title":"2 Types of Conjunctive Structures and Their Ambiguities","paragraphs":["First, we will explain what kind of conjunctive structures (hereafter abbreviated as 'CS') appear in Japanese[l]N.

Since each phrase in the CS has a certain cOherency of meaning, speciM words which separate the meaning in a sentence often limit the scope of a CS. If a path includes such words, we impose penalty points on the path so that the fmssihil - ity of including those are reduced. We define five 'separating-levels' (SLs) for hunsetsus, which express the strength of separating a sentence meaning (Table 3, of. Tahle 1). If bunsetsus on the left side of the path ~md under it include a bunsetsu whose SL is equal to KB's SI, or higher than it, we reduce the path score by (SL of the hunsetsu - KB's SL + 1) x 7. ltowever, two high SL bunsetsus corresponding to each other ofteu exist in a CS, and those do not limit the scope of the CS. For example, topic-marking postpositional particles correspond each other in the following sentential style, h ~. L'C ~ (As to A) .... -cab 9 (be), f~ ~ L~c ~ (~s to ~l) .... -c.~ (~e). Therefore, when two high SL bunsetsus correspond in a CS, that is, the path includes the element which indicates the similarity of them, and those are the 'same-type', the penalty points on them arc not axlded to tile path score. We define thc same-type bunsetsus ~LS two bunsetsus which satisfy the following two conditions. • IWs of them are of the same part of speech, and they have the identical inflection whcn they arc inflectional words. • AWs of them arc identical.","Table 4: Words for honuses. ~ll~t A-tA~ (~Josjultctive noun phrases","4.

Each group of 60 sentences consists of 20 sentences from 30 to 50 characters, 20 sentences from 50 to 80 characters, and 20 sentences over 80 characters. As described in the preceding sections, many factors have effects on the analysis of CSs, and it is very important to adjust the weights for each factor. The method of calculating the path score was adjusted during the experiments on 30 sentences out of 60 sentences from EDCS. Then the other 150 sentences are analyzed by these parameters. As the analyses were successful as shown in the following, this method can be regarded as properly representing the balanced weights on each factor. This method defines where the CS ends, that is, which bunsetsu corresponds to the KB. However, as for conjunctive noun phrases containing clause modifiers or conjunctive predicative clauses, it is almost impossible to find out exactly where the CS starts, because mm~y bunsetsus which modify right-hand bunsetsus exist in each part of the CSs and usnally they do not correspond exactly. Thus it is necessary to revise the starting position of the CS obtained by this method. We treat the actual prior part of a CS as extending to bunsetsus which modify a bunsetsu in the prior part of it obtained by this method, unless they contain comma or topic-marking postpositional particle \" #2 \"(ha). 4.1 Examples of Correct Analysis Examples of correct analysis are shown in Figure 6-8. The revisions of CS scopes are shown in notes of each figure. Chains of alphabet symbols attached to matrix elements show the maximum path concerning the KB marked by the same alphabet and '>'. In the case of example(a) in Figure 6, the conjunctive noun phrase, in which eight nouns are conjuncted (chains of %', 'b', ...

Thus changing the sinlilarity points for more detailed groups of parts of speech (e,g. nouns call be divided into ilul~lerals~ proper nonns, conlmon nouns, and action nouns which becomc verbs by the combiua-tion with \" ~-~ (do)\") can improve the accuracy of the anMysis. For example, the example(i) in 'Fable 6 may bc analyzed rightly if the similarity points between action noun \"t1~[~ (extension)\" and action noun \"t~'f (maintenance)\" is greater than that between action noun \" t1~ (extension)\" and common noun \" ~1~ (di~cully)\". • Semantic similarities between words are currently calculated only by using BOIl which do not contain technical terms. If tile sinfilarity points between technical terms can be given by thesaurus, tile accuracy of tile analysis will be improved.

For example, because Japanese modifier/modifyee relations, inchnling the relation between a verb and its case frame elements, do not erc~s each other, the modifier/modifyee relations in nmm phrases and predicative clauses do not spread beyond each phrase or clause, except the relation concerning the last bunsetsu of them. This condition is not satisfied by the analyzed CS in the example(ill) whose prior noun phrase contains no verb related with the case frame element \" ~,~\" (grammar)\". By this condition it can be~-~- timated that only \" 17~1/~[0 (natural langlage)"]},{"title":"MI~ ~ (analysis and)\" or \"~i:~: (analysis and)\"","paragraphs":["AODdS Dr COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hOt~T 1992 17 $ PROC.

We are planning to do such a correction in the next stage of the syntactic analysis, which analyzes all modifier/modifyee relations in a sentence using the CS scopes detected by this method. • in example(iv), the KB in the beginning part of a sentence corresponds to the last CB. That is, a short part of a sentence corresponds to the following long part. It is very difficult to analyze such an extremely unbalanced CS because this method gives a priority to similar CSs. In order to analyze example(iv) the causal relationship between \"~1~-9\"C (usiug)\" and \"~tr~'J~z~ (create)\" will be necessary. • Some sentences analyzed incorrectly are too subtle even for a human to find the right CSs. Exampie(v) cannot be analyzed rightly without expert knowledge. • This method cannot handle the CSs in which the prior part contains some modifiers and the posterior part contains nothing corresponding to them (example(vi), Figure 9). For these structures we must think the path extending upward in a partial matrix, but it is impossible by the criteria about word similarities alone. The CSs such as example(v) and example(vi) cannot be analyzed correctly without semantic informs-tion. fIowever such expressions are very few in actual text."]},{"title":"5 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We have shown that varieties of parallel structures in Japanese sentences can be detected by the method explained in this paper. As the result, a long sentence can be reduced into a short one, and the success rate of syntactic analysis of these long sentences will bccome very high. There are still some conjunctive expressions which cannot be recognized by the proposed method, and we are tempted to rely on semantic information to get proper analyses for these remaining cases. Semantic information, however, is not so reliable as syntactic information, and we have to make further efforts to find out syntactic rather than semantic relations in these difficult cases. We think that it is possible. One thing which is certain is that we have to see many more components simultaneously in a wider range of word strings of a loug sentence."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] M. Nagao, J.
