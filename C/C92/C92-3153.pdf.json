These informations could be organized in the form of a finite automaton such as: pilot studies N plural | \"'\" (compound) | The exploration of the context should provide clues that eliminate the non-relevant solutions. For this purpose we use local grammar constraints represented by finite automata. We have designed and implemented an algorithm which performs this task by using a large variety of linguistic constraints. Both the texts and the rules (or constraints) are represented in the same formalism, that is finite automata. Performing subtraction operations between text automata and constraint automata reduce the ambiguities. Experiments were performed on French texts with large scale dictionaries (one dictionary of 600.000 simple inflected forms and one dictionary of 150.000 inflected compounds). Syntactic patterns represented by automata, including shapes of compound nouns such as Noun followed by an Adjective (in gender-number agreement) (Cf 5. I), can be matched in texts. This process is thus an extension of the classic matching procedures because of the on-line dictionary consultation and because of the grammar constraints. It provides a simple and efficient indexing tool. 2."]},{"title":"Motivation","paragraphs":["* This work was supported by DRET and Ecole Polytechnique. ** Universit(~ Marne la Vallre. Institut Gaspard Monge. 2 Allre Jean Renoir. 93160 Noisy le Grand. France eroche@ladl.jussieu.fr Universit6 Paris 7 Automatic analysis by phrase-structure grammar is time COtlsuming. The need for fast procedures leads to grammar representations that are less powerful but easier to handle than general unification procedures. Pereira and Wright 1991 and Rimon and Herz 1991 proposed such approaches, that is, algorithms that perform the construction of a finite-state automaton approximation of a phrase-structure grammar, These automata are then used as simple checkers of well-formed patterns. However, parsing a sentence and only providing the information that it does (or doesn't) match the automaton description is not sufficient. One should provide (see K. Koskenniemi 19901 the readings of the text that respect exactly the constraints.We propose here an algorithm that provide all these readings. Moreover, the autonlatou of a given text can be highly ambiguous, and in order to increase its adequacy (e.g. to study given syntactic patterns), we may want to customize it. To achieve such a result, we construct automata that eliminate paths irrelevant to the given study I. Once this operation was performed, significant patterns (like Noun Adjective in French) can be extracted, Technical terms in many domains take the form of sequences such as Noun Adjective, Noun de Noun etc. Their recognition thus leads to an efficient indexation process. This is a complementary approach to statistical treatments like those presented in K.Church, W. Gale, P. Hanks, D. Hindle 1989 or in N. Calzolari and R. Binzi 1991. Moreover, we use Finite-State Automata (FSA) at all stages of the process: for dictionary consultation, for disambiguation and for the final extraction process. This allowed the experiments to be done on-line starting with untagged corpora. One of the crucial points is that tagged text should be represented by FSA in order to be disambiguated (disambiguated texts are already in this form in Rimon and Herz 1991 and K. Koskenniemi 1990). FSA representation for ambiguities representation is not a new approach but in our contribution, we 1Sonic of these paths may correspond to legitimate solutions.

This set of forbidden sequences is described by the automaton of figure 2. Figure 2. Thus the FSA representing the text according to the roles should be the FSA of figure 3. Figure 3. The problem consists in constructing the automaton of figure 3 given those of figures 1 The reader probably noticed that file rules were described as a set of forbidden sequences, which is unusual. The formal operation and the algorithm are easier to describe with negatively defined rules, it is the reason why we use this device here. However, given the grammar corresponding to the automaton representation, the procedure is equivalent to a set of rules expressed in a positive, and hence more usual way. 4. The algorithm 4.1 Formal description of the problem. The problem, informally described, can easily be specified in the following way: ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~T 1992 9 9 4 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28. 1992 Given a text, its FSA representation (e.g. figure 1) AI is defined by the 5-tuple (Alph,QL,il,Fl,dl) which respectively denotes its alphabet, its state set, its starting state, its final state set and its transition function 4 which maps (Ql*Alph) into Q1. Moreover, A1 has the property of being acyclic (it is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)). The constraints are represented by the FSA A2, defined in the same way by (Alph,Q2,i2,f2,d2). These automata define respectively the regular languages LI=L(AI) (i.e. the language accepted by A1) and L2=L(A2) (i.e. the language accepted by A2) • Since L2 describes the set of sequences (or factors) forbidden in any word of L1, if A describes the text after the filtering, this means that L=L(A) follows the condition L = L1 \\Alph* L2 Alph* This operation on languages will be called factor subtraction and will be noted L=L1 f- L2. At this point, we can define the related operation on automata: if LI=L(A1) and L2=L(A2) we say that A is the factor subtraction of A1 and A2 and note it A= A1 f-A2 if L=L1 f- A2 and L=L(A). 4.2 Informal description of the algorithm We will first apply the algorithm on a small example. Suppose that A1 is the automaton represented in figure 4, that A2 is the automaton represented in figure 5 and that we want to compute AI f- A2.","c Figure 4 c Figure 5 Each state of the automaton A=At f- A2 will be labelled with a state of A 1 and a set of states of A2 (i.e a member of the power set of Q2). More concretely the automaton A=A 1 f- A2 of figure 6 is built in the following way: The initial state is labelled (0,{0}), the first 0 refers to the state 0 of A1 (01 for short). The letter a leads, from 01 to the state 11 of AI but to nothing in A2, we construct the state 4The automata are assumed to be detotministic, which is not an additional constraint since one can determinize them (see Aho, HoperopfL Huffman 1974 for instance). (1,{0}) which means that, for a, 0 leads to 1 in At but that {0} leads to nothing (the empty set) in A2 to which we systematically add the initial state. On the other hand, d2({0},b)={ 1 } to which we add, as for a, the state 0; thus, in A, d((0,{O}),b) = (dl(O,b), {O,d2(0,b)})= (1,{0,1}). For each state being constructed, we list file states it could refer to in A2 and, for each of these states, their image by the letter being considered. A specific configuration is when the state of A being considered has one of his label that leads to the final state of A2, it means that a complete sequence of A2 has been recognized and should then be deleted. This is the case if we look at state (2,{0,1,2}) in A: d2({0,1,2},b)=[1,2,3} where 3 is final, thus it has no m msition for b, which leads to delete the path bbb forbidden by A2.

Experimental results Given a syntactic pattern (fL,'st Noun followed by an Adjective) and a text, we can detect its occurrences. We can search the text without applying constraints, this provides output 1 (figures 7 and 8).We can also search it after having applied constraints (output 2). We shall compare both outputs. For instance, for the sentence: L'individu n'y est pas perfu comme une valeur abstraite et universelle, mais comme un ~tre concret, comme le membre d'un ensemble particulier, Iocalisd et qui n'eJdste que darts son rapport d cet ensemble. the program provides the following matchings: (t) (2) y est valeur abstraite valeur abstraite 6tre concret ~tre concret ensemble particulier dun ensemble particulier Figure 7 DELAF ] [DELACF","[compound word Simple words [dictionary dictionary 570.000 entries [ 150.000 entries"]},{"title":"v I esen ti°n I-'--->i","paragraphs":["V"]},{"title":"I F a pr° n° °n I-->Q","paragraphs":["after constraints Figure 8 The program runs in three steps (figure 8).

The program is in C. time spent is low enough to permit on-line use (for compound word enrichment for instance). 5.1 Searching Noun-Adjective patterns First, let us consider the pattern Noun Adjective (which is approximately equivalent to the English sequence adjective-noun). We first tried to search each contiguous pair of words whose first element was labelled as a noun and whose second element was an adjective. This provides the result of the first line of figure 9. The first filtering uses the fact that, in French, the word and the adjective have to agree on their gender and on their number. This gives, for the same texts, the results of the second line. Third we applied the algorithm described above as a second filter, this leads to the results of the third line.","Editorial Article Novel Corpus","4185 13010b. 369292b 1738115","bytes (4p) (100p).","/1 pa~e) NAdj 66 227 3334 31532","15\" 40\" 19' Ih25 NAdj 56 198 2651 28234 a~eemen 15\" 40\" 19' lh25 t NAdj 13 40 1277 11125 agreem.+ 20\" 50\" 41' 3h05 constr.
