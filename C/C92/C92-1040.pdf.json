The former is known for its successhd treatment of tong-distance dependencies, coordination, and, more recently, matters of discourse focus relating to intonation---none of which have been treated within Conceptual Semantics. The latter is known for its development of conceptual structures, which are mental representations intended to serve as the link between language and other areas of cognition, e.g. vision, ac-tion and inference--which CCG stops short of. Since CCG is a. lexically oriented theory of grammar, the two are entirely compatible, as well as complementary.","The immediate motivation to attempt such an integration, and the focus of the present paper, is CCG's in-complete treatment of sameness of role (i.e. thematic) information. In CCG, semantic function-argument structures are compositionally produced through the course of a derivation. These structures identify, inter alia, which entities play the same roles in different events for expressions involving a wide range of coordinate constructs. For example, the semantic function-argument structure shown in (lb) is derived for the sentence in (la) via type-raising, composition, and coordination of the bracketed non-standard constituent, following the analysis of Dowty [Dow88]: 1","(la) Jack filled [the urn with coffee] and [the thermos with milk]."]},{"title":"(lb) (fill' urn' coffee' jack') & (fill' thermos' mill\" jack')","paragraphs":["Of course, such semantic function-argument structures are intended only for illustrative purposes; indeed, according to Steedman, semantic constants like urn' are \"mere placeholders for a real semantics, intended to do no more than illustrate this compositionality.\" Nevertheless, we may glean from these structures the requirement that urn' and thern*os' play the same semantic role, since they are both first arguments to fill', and likewise for coffee' and milk', since they are both second arguments. In the terminology of Conceptual Semantics, these requirements may be restated in terms of thematic roles as follows: urn' and lhermos' share the thematic role Goal in their respective events; like-","1The semantic role of determiners and tenne will be ignored in this paper.

For example, consider (2), together with two possible sets of interpretations that follow: (2a) Jack filled the urn {with decaf}. (2b) The urn filled {with decaf}. (2c) Coffee filled the urn {* with decal}.

This problem may be avoided by introducing distinct constants ill//' (with possibly varying arities), as shown in (4). Note, however, that this approach is incomplete, insofar as it fails to equate any semantic roles across the functions til~ ', at least in the absence of further conditions on these functions.","To handle these cases as well, the present paper demonstrates how to adapt the solution developed in Conceptual Semantics to fit tile CCG paradigm. This approach may be seen as one method of specifying, in a principled fashion, the further conditions on constants like filli' necessary to give a complete account of thematic role identities. 3 It should not be viewed, however, as a variant of purely syntactic approaches to verbal diathesis, such as the Unaccusative tlypothesis [Bur86] in GB, which posit movement between an underlying and a surface structure and traces to recover thematic roles) 2 This restatetaent is actually a cor~iderable atrengtheldngb as CCG is not committed to anything stronger thmt the individual thematic role view (cf.

A CCG deriw~tion starts with lexical lookup, which identifies the functional type and semantics of cach constituent. For example, the category of the verb fill needed for .lack filled the urn is as shown in (5): (5) ~ill := ($\\NP)/NP : fill_a' In this notation, a category consists of a syntactic category paired via an infix colon with a semantic function. Syntactic categories have arguments appearing to the right of slashes, results to the left. The direction of the slash indicates tile direction of tlle argument. Thus the syntactic category (S\\NP)/NP defines a fimction that takes all NP to tile right and returns a function from an NP on the left to an S. Categories may combine via for-ward or backward functional application, indicated as ACTF~S DE COLING-92, Nhrcre.s, 23-28 AO~'r 1992 2 4 7 PROC. OF COL1NG-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 > and < in Figure 1. Categories may also combine by other means such as composition, often yielding multiple derivations of the same string. For present purposes this is of no significance, as all of the derivations of will produce the stone compositional meaning. Derivations for the rest of the examples in (2) are quite similar, differing only in the lexically specified category for fill. 2.2 Conceptual Semantics Example (2) again suffices to review the necessary details of Conceptual Semantics. The version of Conceptual Semantics presented below is that of [Jac90] prior to the introduction of Linking Theory, plus a few modifications. Let us begin with the representation of an urn. Jackendoff represents an urn as the conceptual structure shown in (6): (~) [Thing URN] This represents an entity of ontological type Thing that meets the featural description URN. 5 To distinguish different urns, I will follow Zwarts and Verkuyl [ZV91] in requiring all conceptual structures to have an index, as shown in (7a): (7a) [Thing URN]j (Tb) Thing(j) & URN(j) Note that under the Zwarts and Verkuyl formalization, (7a) is roughly equivalent to the more familiar (7b).","In addition to the ontological type Thing, an entity may be of type Place, Path, Event, State, Manner or Property. The Place in t, he urn, for example, would be represented as in (8a): (8&) [Place IN([Thins URN]/)]p (8b) Place(p) & IN(j,p) & Thing(j) & URN(j) Here we have a conceptual function IN: Thing ~ Place mapping the urn j to the locatiou inside the urn p. Example (8b) is again an approximate notational variant.","Moving on to the stative reading of example (2c), Coffee filled the urn, we introduce the conceptual function BE: Thing x Place -, State (note that as in this example, ontological categories and indices will often ~Sma]l caps will be used to indicate feature~ that are atomic in Conceptual Structure, serving oldy ~ links to other areas of cognition. be suppressed for typographical convenience):","(9a) [ BE([COFFEE],, [IN([URN])]p) ] State FILL s (9b) State(a) &FILL(g) & BE(i,p,s) & ... Extending [Jac90], I have included the conceptual atom FILL in (9a). As is the case of other categories, this atom serves as a pointer to semantic information not captured by the decomposition. Thus the state s is to be understood as one characterized by the atom FILL and by the feature BE(I,p). Note that the variant in (9b) is reminiscent of the neo-Davidsonian approach adopted by Parsons [Parg0].","To get the inchoative reading of (2c), we need only add the conceptual function INCH: State -~ Event shown in (10): I INCH( [ BE([cOFFEE]' [IN([URN])]) ] 1 FILL ) Event •"]},{"title":"(10)","paragraphs":["The conceptual structure for example (2b), The urn filled {with deca~, would differ minimally from (10) by having [DECAF] as the Theme instead of [COFFEE], or by having the Theme left implicit.","We are now in a position to construct the conceptual structure for example (2a), Jack filled the urn {with decal}, by adding the External Instigator function C(AU)S(E): Thing x Event --* Event and the Actor-Patient function AFF(ECT): Thing x Thing ~-* Event:","(1 In) FILL","AFF([JACK]/, [URNJj) Event FILL e (llb) Event(e) & FILL(e) & AFF(i,j,e) & ... Here the representation of the inchoative event serving as the second argument of CS has an implicit Theme k, which the with-PP would specify if present. Note also that the entity [JACK]/ serves as both Actor and External Instigator, and likewise [URN]/ serves as both Patiant mid Goal, by virtue of coindexation. And again, the variant in (1 lb) indicates the similarity of this approach to the neo-Davidsonian one.","At this point we may observe that representations in (9) - (11) capture the similarities and differences in semantic roles observed in tile arguments of the verb ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 2 4 8 PROC.

To capture such generalizations, Jackendoffproposes to eliminate rigid coindexation between syntactic and semantic structures, opting to introduce Linking Theory to handle this task instead. Lexieal entries are there-fore modified to indicate only which conceptual constituents must be specified, and not which syntactic constituents must specify them.

These arguments are twofold. First, verbs appear to idiosyncratically specify prepositions. Such verbs may be accommodated within the present framework by simply providing fully specified categories like (15). Second, and more interestingly, some Incorporated Argument Adjuncts arc syntactically obligatory. This argument presupposes, of course, a Observe that the syntactic ordering cannot be defined from the syntactic type if subjects are to precede complements.

In contrast, the traditional oblique argument analysis will be seen to surmount these difficulties in a natural way.","Jaekendoff's informal version of the With-Theme Adjunct Rule is repeated below:","(22) With-Theme Adjunct Rule: In a sentence containing with NP in the VP, if the Theme position is not indexed in the verb's lexical entry, then the object of with cazl be interpreted as Theme.

Such lexical entries are then used to argue in favor of retaining syntactic subeategorizatiou. This rather unusual move does not seem to be necessary, however. ~ Consider the representation adopted in the present framework, appearing in (27). This representation adequately captures r/d's idiosyncratic selection facts by simply requiring the A-marking of the Theme, forcing the appearance of the with-PP.
