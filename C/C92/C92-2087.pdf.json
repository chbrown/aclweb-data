But we have come to know that we can't construct a practical system with only this processing and that the semantic processing is necessary for it. Inference plays an important role in the semantic processing, we therefore need a large knowledge base about meaning of words and we must treat it as logical relation. Hierarchical relation between words is inevitable and transitive, and it is a important relation in the large knowledge base. Because inevitable relation holds at any time and the reliability of conclusions inferred from it doesn't fall down and transitive relation can be described efficiently. There were some researches on extracting the hierarchical relation between words from definition sentences in a ordinary dictionary[I][2][3][4 l. But they treated it as only binary relation between words. Verbs correspond to n-ary predicates on entities and we therefore must describe the correspondence between the variables (that is case or syntactic role) of a subordinate verb and ones of its superordinate verb. But this correspondence can't be described if the relation is treated as binary relation between words. We will propose how to extract the hierarchical relation with a logical form on verbs from definition sentences in a Japanese dictionary. Firstly, we will define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs and then discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence represents that relation. We will call the main predicate verb in this part the definition verb. Secondly, we will describe how to semiautomatically select the proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence between the variables of an entry verb and ones of the ~lefinition verb.
