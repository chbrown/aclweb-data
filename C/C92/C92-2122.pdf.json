Hobbs identifies two central research problems in understanding how people interpret discourse. We must characterise: (1) the knowledge that people have, and (2) the processes they use to deploy that knowledge. This includes specifying and constraining the inferential and retrieval processes that operate on what is known[7]. This problem is of practical interest for the design of various types of natural language interfaces (NLI's) that make use of different knowledge sources. The knowledge used by an NLI is often split into two types. DOMAIN-INDEPENDENT knowledge consists of grammatical rules and lexical definitions. It also includes knowledge used for common-sense reasoning[6]. DOMAIN-DEPENDENT knowledge centres on modeling processes unique to the application task, or the particular relations in the application database. The process of customising an NLI consists in adding the domain-dependent knowledge abont a particular application to the domain-independent knowledge that comes with the NLI[4]. Very little has been written about how this eustomisation is done. This paper results from a particular customisation effort in which we took a commercially available NLI and attempted to customise it to a large sales and marketing information database installed at a customer site. The application wa.s information retrieval for decision support. We suggest a particular method to be used in the customisation process and evaluate the success of this method. We note a number of problems with using the domain independent knowledge provided with the NLI for our particular application. We al~ note eases where the inferential processes supported by the NLI do not appear to be appropriately constrained. The application of this method leads to some general results about the process of customisation, as well as .some specific insights regarding this type of application and the evaluation of an NLI. Section 2 describes the particular NLI and the application. Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 describe the methodology that we applied in our customisation effort. Section 8 describes the results of testing the customisation. Finally, Section 9 provides suggestions for customisers or designers of NLI's."]},{"title":"2 NLI and Sales Application","paragraphs":["The database was a large and complex on-line sales database, containing information about orders, deliveries, brands, customer preferences, sales territories, promotions and competitors. There were 20-30 different types of records with over 200 views ranging over data summaries of 2-3 years. Our user group consisted of 50 managers, composed of accounts, brands, commercial and marketing managers, each with different data requirements. They fit the user profile recommended for NLI's[8]. They were relatively infrequent computer users, who were experts in the domain with at least one year's experience. None knew anything about database languages. Some of them had used a previously installed NLI, Intellect, as well as a menu-based interface that accessed AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~n\" 1992 8 2 0 PROC.

The NLI we worked with was considered state of the art. It appeared to use a pipeline architecture consisting of morphological analysis, parser, semantic ill-terpretation, and database query translator. The semantic representation language was a hybrid of a semantic network and first order predicate logic, which supported time dependent facts, qnantified statements, tense information and general sets[3]. In addition, this NLI included a Generator that produced English from ttle semantic representation language, a Deductive Sys tern that reasoned about statements in the representation language using forward and backward chaining, and which handled quantification, time dependent facts and truth maintenance. Aruoug the knowledge sources that came with the NLI was a Dictionary of 10000 initial English words, and a set of Concepts that provided internal notions of predicates, and set and membership hierarchies. The semantic representation, concepts, and dictionary modules supported both intensional and extensional representation of data. In addition, users could add both new concepts and inference rules to tile sys tern with simple declarative sentences."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["Information sources for the customisation inchlded: the customisation manual, database scheina, NL transcripts of users accessing tile data in the database using the previous NLI, Intellect, and a test. suite of English sentences[2].

We collected a list of all the unknown word errors from the Intellect installation. For example using the term wholesalers resulted ill an Intellect error, but it refers to a subset of trading companies with trade category of WSL. We didn't feel that the syntax of the transcripts was important since it reflected a degree of accommodation to Intellect, but the Intellect lexicon and the unknown word errors gave us a good basis for the required lexical and conceptual coverage. In the absence of such information, a method to acqnire it, such as Wizard of Oz studies, would be necessary[10, 1]. ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO(rl 1992 8 2 1 I)ROC.

We started with a list of lexical items e.g. markets, sectors, brands, deliver, pack size, date, corporate, trading concern, customer location, that were part of the Intellect lexicon or had appeared in the transcripts as unknown words. By placing these lexical items on the 1~1~. diagram we were able to sketch out tim mapping between user terms and database concepts beforc cormnitting anything to the customisation files s. How-ew;r, we found mapping vocabnlary onto the E-R diagram to be rnore difficult than we had anticipated. First, a nmnber of words were ambiguous in that they could go in two different places on the E-R diagram, atul thus apparently refer to multiple concepts in the domain. This was most clearly demonstrated with certain generic terms such as customer. Customer can be used to refer to a relation at any level of the cuStomer hierarchy, the conceru, the trading company or the corporation. It can also be associated with the attribute of the customer reference number which is a key value in the 'Concern' database relation. Second, some words were based on relationships between two entities, so they could have gone in two places. For instance market share is calculated frona information associated with both the market entity and with the trade sector entity. Similarly, the term deity. cry refers to a relation between any level of the product hierarchy and any level of the customer hierarchy. Yet there was no entity that corresponded to a delivery, even though it was one of the main concepts in the domain. In both of these cases we created new entities to refer to concepts such as delivery and market share. We were then able to indicate links between these concepts and other related concepts ill the domain and could annotate these concepts with the relevant vocabulary items. In some cases it was difficult to determine whether a term should be a new entity. For instance the term wholesalers refers to members of the trading company entity with a particular value in the trade category attribute. However since trade category is not used in any other relation, it doesn't have a separate entity of its own. In this case we left wholesaler as a term associated with trading company. Third, in our lexicon there were operators or predi-3 In a perfect world, the NLI would target an ,E~R diagram and the snapping front the E~R diagram to the database would be aa independent aspect of the semantic modelling of the domain. cators such as less than, greater than, equal to, at least, change, decrease, latest estimate, over time, chart, graph, pie, during, without, across, display, earliest, available. These operators were domain independent operators; some of them were synonyms for functions that the system did support. Since these seem to be concepts perhaps related to the task, but not specific to the domain, for convenience we created a pseudo entity on the E-R diagram having to do with output and display concepts such as graphing, ranking, displaying information as a percentage etc. Finally, there were also terms for which there was no database information such as ingredients and journey, ambiguous terms such as take, get, accept, use, as well as terms that were about the database itself, such as database, information. For other terms such as earliest or available it was difficult to determine what domain concepts they should be associated with. tiowever, the benefits of this method were that once we had made the extensions to the E-R diagram, then all synonyms were clearly associated with the entities they referred to, words that could ambiguously refer to multiple concepts were obvious, and words for which a calculation had to be specified were apparent. We were also able to identify which concepts users had tried to access whiclt were not present in the domain. Once this was done the cnstomisation files were built incrementally over the restricted domain."]},{"title":"6 Constructing the customisation files","paragraphs":["The input to this part of the process was the annotated F~R diagram as well as the test suite. We chose not to use the menu system customisation tool that was part of the NLI 4. We preferred to use an interface in which declarative forms are specified in a file. As we developed the customisation file incrementally over the domain, we ensured that all the synonyms for a concept were specific(I, and thoroughly tested the system with each addition.

AUG. 23-28. 1992 ducea mapping between English words, database relations, attributes and values, and concepts used ill common sense reasoning by tile deductive conrponent of the NIA. A database relation, such as 'Deliveries', could [lave nouns or verbs a~sociated with it, e.g. delivery or deliver. In tile case of verbs, mappings are specified to indicate which attributes correspond to each argument slot of the verb. In either case, both relation and attribute mappings, give one an opportunity to state that the relation or the attribute is a particular type of entity. This type information means that each concept ha_q type preferences associated with its arguments. Tile NLI pro~ vided types such as person, orgallisation, location, manu:factured object~ category, transaction, date or time duration. The specification of these types supplies background information to support various inferential processes. There are three types of inference that will conccrn us here: • Coercion • Generalisation and Specification • Ambiguity rezolution COERCIONS depend on tile type information a.¢sociated with the arguments to verbs. For cxanlple, consider a verb like supply with arguments supplier and suppliee. Let's say that suppliers are specified to he of type concern, and suppliees are of type project. Then the query Who supplied London? violates a type prefcrence specified in the customisation file, namely that suppliee is a project. A coercion inference can coerce London, a city, to proj,~ct, by using the inference path [projsct located location in city]. Then the question can be understood to mean who supplies projects which are in London?f3]. GENERAI,ISATION inferences can suppnrt the. infer-cute that Life is a kind of Cheese given other facts such as Life is in sector Full feat Soft and Full 1:at Soft is a kind of Cheese. A similar inference is supported by tile type organiuation ; if X works for organisation Y, and Y is a suborganisation of organisation Z, then the NLI is supposed to be able to infer that X works for Z. AMBIGUITY resolution consists of iiliing ill under-specified relations. A cerumen case of unspecified relations are those, that hold between the nouns of noun noun compounds (n-n-relations). For example a motorola processor is a processor with motorola as tit(: manufacturer. A deparlmenf monster is a nranager of dcpartment. The specification of conceptual types in Similarly from tile knowledge that an attribute is a location, the NLI can infer that it can be used as ml answer to a question about where Something is. 6.2 Difficulties A minor difficulty in developing tile customisation file was that we identified lexical itenls for which there was no information in tile databa.se, hi this case we used a facility of tile NLI by which we could associate hdpfitl error messages with tile use of particnlar lexical items. In eases where the concept could be calculated from other database informatioir, we were able to use tile NLI to extend the database sehcma and specify tile calculations that were necdcd in order to support uscr's access to these concepts. The more major difficulty was to determine which of the concepts that the NLI knew about, was the type to use tbr a specific donlain lexical item. For exampie m specifying the 'Marke.ts' database relation, target phrases nrigllt be the chocolate market, the market chocolate, sales of chocolates, how much chocolate or kinds of chocolate. One of the types available was categox'y which seems to be the way tile key market-name is used ill the phrase the chocolate market 5. llowever, another el)lion was to create an attribute mapping far marketname. Attribute nlappings can specify that all attribnte type is onc of a different set of types such ass unique identifie~, a n~o, a pay, the employer, or a ~uperorganisation. And some of these have subtypes, e.g. name Call he of type proper, classifier, coulmon, lnndel or patternnumber. So perhaps if one wants to say sales of chocolates then marketname shouhl he a e(unuloti IlaUle. A sohttion would he to say ntarketname belongs to a number of these types, possibly at tile expense of overgencrating. In the case of this l)articular NLI, attempting to do this gellerated warnings."]},{"title":"7 Generating the test suite","paragraphs":["The tt~t suite of sentenccs w~ constructed by selecting selltene~:s that cover the requircnlcnts identified by our transcript analysis from tile published test suite [2].

This is a common feature of most test suites. It also contained some queries which had too much syntactic complexity to be of use in identifying separable problems in the customisation file. We therefore created a smaller set of deliveries test queries that used only the more simple syntactic forms and which was organised with incremental domain coverage. This was ideal for iterative development of the eustomisation, and enabled us to concentrate on get-ting the basic coverage working first. Later in the customisation we used the more complete syntax-based test suite to get a more complete picture of the limitations of the resulting system with respect to user requirements. We will discuss a possible remedy to the situation of having two distinct test suites in the conclnsion."]},{"title":"8 Testing the customisation","paragraphs":["Some of tile coverage limitations were specific to this NLI, but there are some general lessons to be learned.

These seemed to be domain independent concepts, but to our surprise we discovered that this representation of common-sense knowledge incorporated a particular model of the world. For instance, a lot of support was provided for the concepts of t ime and time durat±onu, but time was fixed to tire calendar year. Our domain had its own notion of time in terms of bookweeks and bookmonths in which weeks did not run from Sunday to Sunday and months could consist of either 4 or 5 weeks. The English expression weekly deliveries was based on this and manager's commissions were calculated over these time durations. ]'here were a number of cases where domain dependent knowledge was embedded in the presumably domain independent conceptual and dictionary structure of the NLI. For instance how much was hard-wired to returu an answer in dollars. The point is not that it didn't respond in pounds sterling, but rather that our users wanted amounts such as eases, tonnes~ and ease equivalents in response to questions such as How much caviar was delivered to TinyGourmet? Another feature of world knowledge which made customisation difficult was tbe fact that predefined concepts comprise a set of built-in definitions for certain words. These definitions were part of tile core lexicon of 10,000 words provided with the system, but the custouriser is not given a list of what these words are 6. This causes mysterious conflicts to arise with domain-specific definitions. For instance, we had to first discover by carefid sleuthing that the system had its own definitions of consumer, customer, warehouse, sale, and configuralion, and then purge these definitions. It was not pos.sible to determine the effects of these purges in terms of other concepts in tile system. hi particular, there were concepts that were not easy to renmve by pnrging lexical definitions such ms the concept of TIME mentioned shove. The ambiguity of predefined concepts also arose for certain verbs. For example, the verb to have was pre-defined with special properties, but no explicit definition was made available to the customiser. It was impossible to determine the effects of nsing it, and yet it seemed unwise to purge it. Our application had a great need for GENERALISA-TION type inferences due to the product, customer and time hierarchies (see figure 1). Tbe most common verb was deliver and this could refer to deliveries of any level in the product hierarchy to any level in the customer hierarchy. We spent a great deal of time trying to get this to work properly and were not able to. In the examples below (Q) is the original query, (P) is the paraphrase provided by the system and (R) is the ~Presumably because thln in consider proprietary knowledge.

Other problems were not so clearly problems with common sense knowledge but rather with inappropriately constrained inferential powers.

Ill most cases transcript information will not t)e available and so interview data or experimental Wizard-of-Oz data[10] will have to be generate d to make explicit the users' models of the domain. The I'~R model of the domldn was very useful for carrying out an incremental dcvelopruent of tile customisation file. It lets the customiscr know where the reasonable domain boundaries lie, in order that sub parts of the customisation call sensibly bc developed and tested in isolation. In addition the eustomisation wa.u simplified by having the entities and attributes of tile E-I~ model labelled with the domain vocabulary in advance. Thus the process of associating synonyms with appropriate eustomisation tile relations and attributes wa.u straighttbrward. The main linfitation of tile approach seem to be that E-I~ diagrams are too limited to capture the use of the vocabulary ill the domain. Wc used an E-R diagram because it was the conceptual representation available for the domain and because it is the most prevalent semantic modeling tool used ill databa.sc design. However, it does not in fact allow one to represent the information that one would like to represent for the purl)oses of linking NL concepts and lexical items to the domain. The only semantic information associated with relations that is represented in all E-It diagram are whether they are many-to-one or one-to-one.

OF COL1NG-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 should be much richer, possibly incorporating semantic concepts such as whether a relation is transitive, or other concepts such as that an attribute represents a part of a wtmle. Of course this is part of what the NLI was attempting to provide with its concept hierarchy and dictionary of 10000 initial words. But it seemed that one of the main difficulties with the NLI was in fact exactly in attempting to provide a richer semantic model with common sense information to support inference. This is commonly believed to be helpful for the portability of a NL system across a number of domains. We found it a hindrance mnre than a help. Some predefined concepts had to be purged from the lexicon. Some definitions were difficult to delete or work around e.g. time definitions. The problems we encountered made us wonder whether there is any general world knowledge or whether it is always flavoured by thc perspective of the knowledge base designers and the domains they had in mind. The process was not helped by the black box nature of the NL system. The general problem with black box systems is that it is difficult for a cnstomiser to get an internal model of system. It would help a great deal if the world model was made available directly to the customiser, the semantics of each concept was clearly defined, and a way to modify rather than purge certain parts of the conceptual structure was made available. The customiser sitould not be left to learn by example. During customisation of the NL system we found our user requirements test suite ditficult to use for debugging purposes. The test suite had to be modified to reflect concepts in the database rather than syntax. This is because customisations must be done incrementally and tested at each phase. A solution to this problem is first to ensure that the test suite has a number of sentences which test only a single syntactic construction. Second, store the test suite components in a database. Each component would be retrievable through the semantic class it belonged to (i.e Temporal Expression or Complex NP). In addition each component would be retrievable through the concepts of the E-R diagram that it accessed. Then it should be possible to generate test suites that are usable by developers for the purpose of testing customisation files. Simple querie~s of the test suite database about a particular concept would generate appropriate test sentences whose setaantic categories and category fillers were limited to that concept."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Ntis Dahlback and Arne Jonsson.
