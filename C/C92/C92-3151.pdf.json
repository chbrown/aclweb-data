This work has been accomplished thanks to a first research contract with the Ministry of Research and Technology and today has lead to a dictionary of more than 100 000 words and phrases grouped analogically and syr~ymo~y. If we understand quite well how a dictiolmry like this can be used with ease by humans, we set the problem of the identification of meaning by a computer. We will evaluate how Dicologique adds information eomplentaty to the information contained in semantic nets. Thanks to a somewhat unusual cons~on method and the systematic classification of words according to their meaning, we are progressing to a continuous system of localisalion of the meaning itself. On the map we created, it is possible to compute the meaning due to lexical semantics for any sentence written in natural language... 1) ~ rt~,,om or ~xXaC_AL IRCTIONARH~ The purpose of dictionaries grouped under the name \"analogical\" is always the ease of the passage from a word to an idea and the inverse passage from an idea to a word. This aim is reached by the make up of lists of stereotyped associations and of semantic fidds. The first aRnoach does not have the same likelihood of ending with a satisfactory result as the second. The stereotyped associations depend on the idea of time, the background and the experience of each individual. Their record can only be a track of the ~ve memory from the individual. On the other hand, the dictionary of semantic fields is perfectly workable at any time ; it is based on the linguistic ~x~aventicqrs that the language dictionaries have tried for ~nturies to record and to normalize. It is not possible, by definition, to consmact a dictionary made up of stereotyped ass~ations, whereas it is possible to work on the complexity of hundreds and t.housar~ of linguistic facts which we have classified. We will give a mathematical description of the dictionary of the semantic fields. This approach is in parallel with concrete examples derived from the database. 2) ~ Area ~Tm~ or Tr~ \"lhe dictionary of analogies and synonyms that has been set up is a structure of sets and words which the conceptual figure (1) shows. The objects \"words\" (shown by W,,) are represented in the reclhngles and the objects \"sets\" (shown by Ci) in the parallelograms."]},{"title":"I ,I","paragraphs":["Fig l : G , ffle ~ mxtd of grc dktkrmy _ Lecture 1 coat.dr N)","f ~¢\" b~tcau de pEda~ d¢ ~\" /,/pla~tnc,~ J","= ,",",","Leetare t =ppartmh\" it, ~t Inclns dtas Fig 2\" ~npb ofa ~ 2.1 ) MOVI~IG H~M Ti~ l.E~ To'n~RIOn\" When moving through Dicologique from the left to the right, we move from the general to the specific. a) Ikfalifions Imlast ta tbe nlnlim fmm llle Idt to the * Suplx~ we talc ~ a set aaatah~ in C, \"the ~ r,(c~ C9 reinsures the dep6 o~ ~ indusk~ F~amp~ : P(bate~ 1, ~delCx:he 2) = 1 ~tmm) =0 1 lua~:lx~t"]},{"title":"2~depa~: tisl~l~t","paragraphs":["ACRES DE COLING-92, NAr¢1 .y.s, 23-28 AOt~rr 1992 9 8 3 Pgoc.

We have the following types of grammatical sets : noun, verb, adjective, adverb. - the set mn-~ \"dass\" A set of this type ¢xmtains nouns which can be subsumed under the same concept. In our example in figure (2), \"bateau\" is a set containing on the one hand words which represent its ~ vahe.s (\"bateau', \"navire\", \"embarcalion\") and ca the ocher \"~\" of specific boats~ - the set mn~ \"mlazd ~xts\" ~y, the contents and utilizations of this type of set are rather various. We need it, for example, to ~t the link between \"baleinier\" and \"baleine \"13, which is not shown in figure 2 so as not to weigh down the graph. -tbe set mrmd \"tlxrne\" This set contains all the concepts and words associated in a particular semantic field.

For example, our set of class \"bateau 16ger de #che\" could be found under a set characterized by the feature \"small\" which differenciates this class from other classes of boats. As for the words, we have provided them with the usual characteristics, i.e. their morphological classes (grammar) and their usage labels (colloquial, archaic, literary ...) which contain the labekine: ~le ACRES DE COLING-92.

Here are some examples of ~arches which are always based on the intersection of sets edited by the function U(Cj) : - Search ofapnxfise mm Search of the name of the \"coiffure du Pape t4''. The intersection of \"Pape l-s\" (theme of 162 words) and \"chapeau ~6\" (list of 180 words) or \"couronne m (theme of 33 words) produces the Wol~ds \"[Jal~ 18\", \"calott~ 19\" et~. in 10 seconds on the micro eompuler. - Search of v~ds *o extmms aa klea Search of the verb to express the idea of \"faire to~0. and \"couper 21\".
