These verbs quite often constitute verb - deverbal noun structures such as \"make an address,\" \"give an answer\" and \"take an approach.\" The verbs in the structure arc ahnost devoid of lexical meaning but bear syntactic information such as tense, number and person; the deverbal noun carrying the lexical meaning. The verbs, in this case, are called \"dclexical verbs\" [Collins] or \"light verbs,\" [Live] which refers to their lexical emptiness.","In this paper, we call such verbs Delexical Verbs (DV) and a \"DV + deverbal noun structure\" a Delexical Structure (DS) Iollowing the examples ol' [Collins]. The frequency of these verbs in actual text can be seen, for example, in the COLLINS COBUILD ENGLISH DIC-TIONARY, where the pmagraph on the entry \"take\" states: \"The most frequent use of take is in expressions where it does not have a very distinct meaning of its\" own, but where most of the meaning is in the noun that follows it...\"","We have been developing an English to Japanese machine translation system for news broadcasts since 1989 [Aizawa] [Tanaka]. The precise translation of DS's in news texts is of great importance since they are quite frequent here. We counted the number of \"take\" + \"noun\" colloca-tions (as verb + object) in 21 months' worth of AP texts using the parser of the machine translation system. \"Take\" collocated with 2,188 different nouns a total of 20,271 times. Of the collocating nouns, 87 deverbal nouns were found out of the 119 deverbal nouns listed in [Live], comprising about 28% (5,726) of all occurrences. This figure strongly supports the statement in the Collins Dictionary.","Failures in DS translation typically result from producing the primary sense instead of the delexical sense of the DV, which greatly deterioratcs the quality of the translation. For example, \"make an address\" becomes \"enzetsu wo tsukuru,\" which meaTts \"create an address.\"","There are two possible ways of translating a DS. The first is the idiosyncratic approach, listing all the DS's with their Japanese translations in a lexical system. This approach, however, suffers fi'om several shortcomings:","(1) The DS's are numerous and hard to list","exhaustively: some DS's allow pttssivization","and some deverbal nouns can be modified","by quantifiers, adjectives and so on. This","doubles and triples the number of possible","DS combinations.","(2) This direct method is unable to infer the","translation of a DS undefined in a lexicon.","(3) The use of this approach increases the","nulnber of lexical entries, making lexical","management difficult.","Another approach is to synthesize the translation of a DS using the word sense of each component with syntactic and semantic rules. The attractive part of this \"synthetic approach\" is that it does not suffer from the problems mentioned above. The \"ntonosenty approach\" proposed in [Ruhl] can be viewed as the extreme manifesta-tion of the synthetic approach. A recent lexical framework [Bograev] proposes to generate the word sense instead of listing them exhaustively in a lexicon, which is similar to the synthetic approach.","However, fl'om a practical viewpoint, not MI DS's can bc translated by this approach as the necessary rules have not yet been factored out. We propose the use of a DS translation method based mainly on synthesis, and the employment of all idiosyncratic approach where synthesis is difficult. To do this, DS's were categorized into three groups, called type-l, type-2, and idiomatic DS. The first two groups are translated by the synthetic method and the last group is trans-ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES. 23-28 AOt~r 1992 5 6 7 PROC. OF COLING-92, NA~CrES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 lated by an idiosyncratic approach which can hopefully be integrated into the former part as research reveals the underlying rules. This method should provide clear distinctions between idiomatic and synthesizable DS's through the use of a set of rules, which would facilitate the management of lexical systems.","The translation rules are quite simple tbr the following reasons:","(1) English DS~s have Japanese equivalents","in many cases, and some parallels can be","seen between them.","(2) Many Japanese \"verbal nouns\" take the","form of \"sahen-meishi,\" which become","verbs by simply adding \"suru\" to the tail.","However, some DS's require translation in a passive sense. The conditions were factored out through semantic consideration, and were integrated into the translation rules.","The rules were implemented in the machine translation system and AP news texts were translated appropriately, thus proving the feasibility of this method.","2 Delexical Structures This section introduces some definitions and","characteristics of DS's. ADS basically takes the","fo ml: Delexieal Verb + (determiner) + Deverbal","Noun","0: optional","as in \"give an answer,\" \"make an array,\" \"take an approach,\" \"have a battle,\" \"take advice,\" and \"make an announcement.\" Verbs such as \"put,\" \"cast,\" \"pay,\" \"lay,\" and \"throw\" are also known to work as delexical verbs [Live]. These are commonly-used transitive verbs.","DS's have some interesting semantic characteristics. A verb can be substituted for a DS in many cases, but the substitution is one way: thus \"step\" for \"take a step\" but not \"take a move\" for \"move\" [Live]. The verb-substitutable DS's choose one of possibly several word senses of the corresponding verb except when they are metaphoric. The selection is controlled by the co-occuring DV. Thus the same deverbal noun can form DS's which represent different meanings.","make an order ==> request for supply","of goods","give an order ==> command","The DS's give a greater colloquial [Konishi] and euphemistic impression [Yamanashi] than the corresponding verb expressions and used frequently in modern English [Live].","Another feature of a DS is that it gives the impression that the event is brief.'","She gave a scream. (brief)","She screamed. (not brief)","[Collins] Some syntactic operations are possible on DS's. For example, adjectives and possessive pronouns can modify the deverbal noun, and some DS's can be used in passive forms. In this paper, determiners are mainly considered as the modifier of the deverbal noun since they are the basic modifier of the DS's. The verbs \"take,\" \"make,\" \"have,\" and \"give\" are studied since these are the most common DV's. As a result, we are able to obtain a DS in the following form: DV + (det) + NV (1)","0: optional","DV: Delexieal Verb (take, make,","have, give)","det: a, an, the","NV: Deverbal noun","3 Categorization of DS's The previous section mentioned that a DS","chooses a single sense of the corresponding","verb.

In many cases, we can","assume parallels between English and Japanese: (1) The word sense of an English deverbal mmn can be translated into a Japanese word sense of a deverbal noun. (2) The verbalization of an English word sense in a deverbal noun and the verbalization of the corresponding Japanese equivalent can represent the same meaning.","4.2 Type-1 DS Taking advantage of these parallels, the","translation of a type-1 DS can be achieved by","verbalizing the core Japanese translation of the","deverbal noun in a translation lexicon. As we can see from the table in [Live], type-I","DS's are predominant. This justifies the use of","type-1 as the default translation of unknown","DS's. As most of this type can be used passively,","and since deverbal nouns of this type are some-","times modified by adjectives and possessive pronouns, the translation mechanism should also allow the same degree of flexibility.","4.3 Type-2 DS","This type can be translated iu approximately the same way as type-l. However, one difference is that this type verbalizes the peripheral Japanese translation in the lexicon. Since insufficient knowledge has been accrued on what makes the DS select the peripheral meaning, the collocation of DV's and deverbal nouns should be specified in a lexicon. As this type also permits some modification and allows passive transfommtion, it should be translated by synthetic approach.","4.4 Idiomatic DS translation","This type does not verbalize any translation of the deverbal noun and is \"frozen\" in that the deverbal nouns are rarely modified by adjectives and the DS does not allow passive transforma-tion. This type of DS must be listed in a lexicon in its full form with a proper translation. The implied definition of an idiomatic DS here is (1) it does not represent any word sense of individual components and (2) it resists any form of transformation."]},{"title":"5 Passivization","paragraphs":["rules","Some DS's can be substituted with a matching passive verb as shown in [Live], so that \"take comfort\" and \"take counsel\" can be paraphrased as \"be comt'orted\" and \"be counseled,\" respectively. Though the number of such cases does not seem to be large, it is important to translate them passively, otherwise the meaning of the translation is totally reversed. Most DS's which can be substituted by passive verbs should be translated in a passive sense in Japanese because of the parallels between the two languages. \"Take comfort\" and \"take counsel\" should thus be translated \"nagusame rareru\" and \"jyogen wo sareru.\"","In this section, some rules tot passivizafion arc obtained by analyzing the [Live] table.
