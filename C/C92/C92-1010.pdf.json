Dictionary The dictionary is bmsed oil the Turkish \\Vriting Guide [2,3] as the source. Some words in the dictionary haw, to lie marked ~s having certaiu semantic and structural properties such as being a verbal root or a nomiua] root, being a proper noun, not obeying to vowel harmony rules, deformiug under certain conditions, and so on. For examph ~, tile word BUII.UN (nose) have to be niarked as being a nolllilla[ root, and deforming by vowel ellipsis. For this reason, for each word in Ihe dictiouary a series of flags represeuting certain properties of that word are heht. Tllus. each elitry of tim dictionary Colltains a word in Turkish and a series of flags showing certain properties of that wor( [.

Syllabification Check Analyzing all t, he words in Turkish \\Vritithg Guide [23] and all the suffixes ill Turkish [1, b]. w~\" have constructed a legular expression and a corresponding fi nile stale automaton for validating if a word matches the syllablestructttre rules of Turkish [18] This reg+ /llar t?xpr0ssiOll is tised as a heuristic ill oltr spelling checker. The input word is first processed with the regular expression. It is reported as misspelled if its syllaMe structure can not be mat.ched wilh this expression, i.e., tile phonemes of Ihe word do no! form valid sequences accordiug to Turkish syllable struciurcs. ()n tile other hand, if it. can lie matched, it, is flu'ther analyzed as it. tuay still be a non-Turkish or a misspelled word. With th(- hell> of tile syllal)ificat.ion cheek, most of the typographical e.rrors Call be detected. For examph~. if the word YAPMAI( (to make) were typed as YP- .\\I,\\I,2 or YAPMKA. the word would not be matched by the expression and its spelling wouhl be reported incorrect. On tile other hand, ifil, wew written as YAPMEI(, where a vowel harmony error is made, it would pass the syllabification cheek, but would lie reporled as misspelled during morl/holJhonemic checks. 3.3. Root Determination Before analyzing the morpholAmnenfic and morpho logical structures of a Tm'kish word, the root has to be determined. If [he word passes the syllabification check, its root is searched in the dictionary rising a maxilnal match algorithm. In this algorithm, lirst ;[he list of all [lags can Im hmnd in Solak [2(1]. AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO6-r 1992 42 the whole word is searched in the dictionary, If it is found then the word has no suffixes and therefore its spelling is correct. Otherwise, we remove a letter from tile right and search tile restllting substring. We continue this by removiug letters from the right until we find a root. If no root can be found although the first letter of the word is reached, tile word is reported as misspelled. The maximum length substring of the word that is present in tile dictionary is riot always its root. If fin't.her analyses show that the word is misspelled, a new root is searched m the dictionary, this time removing letters from the end of the previous root.. If a Ilew root can be found the same operations are repeated, otherwise tile word is reported &s misspelled. Root determination presents some dittieulties wheu the root of the word is deformed. For the root words which have to be deformed during certain agglutinations, a flag indicating that property is set in the dictionary. For example, the root of the word ,~EHRE (to the city) must be found as ~jgltiR (city). In order to determine it correctly, when the substring SEHR is not found in the dictionary, considering that it illay be a deforined root by vowel ellipsis, the vowel I is inserted between the consonants 11 and R, and the word ~EHIR is searched in the dictionary. When it is fotmd, tile flag corresponding to vowel ellipsis is checked. Since it is set for this word, the root of the word S,'I';IIRE is dcterlnined as ~EIIiR, and remainins analyses are contiuued. If that word were written as .~EHiRE, we should report it ms incorrect although ~EltiR + dative ease suffix form looks correct. For all other root defin'mations, the real root of the word can be fotnld by u/aking such cheeks and some necessary chauges (see [20]). For some roots both of the refills above are valid. For example, both METN[ (accusative of text) and METiN][ (accusative of strong) are correct although the root of both words is MET[N (text, strong) be-catlse this word call be used in twodifferent meanings. 3.4. Morphophonemic Check Turkish words obey vowel and COllSOll~lllt harmouy rules during agglutination (see sections :3.2.1 and 3.2.2). The vowel harmony check may be done jnst after tile root determination, but other morphophonemic checks should be done during morphological anal-3sis, Afier tile root of the word is found, tile rest of tile word is considered as its suli]xes. The first, vowel in the sutfixes part must be in harmony with tile last vowel of the root, while tile succeediug vowels must be in harnmny with the vowel preceding them. Since there are some sulllxes, such as --KEN, whose vowe]s ilever chaugo, when a disharl!lony is fouud, we cimck whether it, is tile result of such a snffix (e.g., YANARI,2I']N (while iI is burning)). PRec. OF COLING-92. NANrEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 SomP words of foreign origin do uot ohey vowel harmony rules during agglutination (e.g., KONTIIOL (control)).

For example, the root of tile word BEYAZ-LA~TIRMAYANLARI}AN (from those which do not cause to hecome white) is found as the noun BEYAZ (white) in our dictionary. Then comes the suffix L{A},5, which makes a verb from a noun, tfierefor,\" a switch t.o the verb parser ha~s to be ulade. Parsillg contimles there until I.he suffix M{A} is nlatched.

Parsing agglutinative word structures necessitates rather nontrivial phonological and morphological analyses which present special difficulties in the development of parsers for such languages, not usually encountered in parsers for other languages. As a resub, the number of parsers developed for agghitinafive languages, and particularly for Turkish, is quite limit.ed, and they have certain shortcomings. We have solved most of the problelns encountered in the previous parsers by lnaking a detailed and careful research on Turkish word formation rules and their exceptions [20]. These results may hopefully be helpful for future researchers on Turkish linguistics. We should note t.hat ewm though it is claimed that word for-marion rules in Turkish are well-defined and Turkish is a very regular language, as used today it shows many irregularities that cause the ln'oblem of parsing I.his language to become a very hard and interesting problem Many grammar books haw~ been referred to collect, Turkish word format.ion rules, hi those books, after each rule is defined, usually it is reminded that tliel'e lllay occur sonte exceptions to that, rule ill SOllle condit,ions, hut mostly those conditions can not be \"well\" defined, For example, in all Turkish grammar books, it is said that \"When a Turkish word ending wit.h one of the consonants P, ~', T, K receives a suffix beginning with a consonant, that final consonant is soft,cued, bul t, here are some such words whose final consonant does not change.\" ]lowever, none of the books says what the common propert.y of those words which do not obey t,o that rule is, because most AcrEs DE COLING-92, NA~n'ES. 23-28 Ao[rr 1992 4 4 PRec.
