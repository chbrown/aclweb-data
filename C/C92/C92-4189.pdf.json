The task requires the solution to two problems: 1) To define an algorithm to automatically identify the genres or hypemym of a noun definition, and 2) to define an algorithm for lexical disambiguation of the genus term. In the last ~ew years, effective methods for solving the first problem have been developed, but the problem of creating an algorithm for lexical disambiguation of the genus terms is one that has proven to be very difficult. In COL1NG 90 we described our itutial work on the automatic crea-tion of a taxonomy of noun senses from Longman's Dictiorlary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). The algorithm for lexical disambiguation of the genus teml was accurate about 80% of the time aid made use of the semantic categories, the subject area luarkings and the frequency of use uffonnatiou in LDOCE. In this paper we report a series of experimcuts which weight the three factors in various ways, and describe our improvements to the algorithm (to about 90% accnracy). 1. Introduction","Much of tile previous research on the construc-tion of networks of ganns terms front MRD's (Amsler and White 1979; Chodorow et al. 1985; Nakanmra and Nagao 1988; Vossen 1990) rexluired human intervention 1o distinguish fire sanses. Recantly, several researchers (Veronis and Ide 1990; Klavans et. al 1990; Copestake 1990; Vossen 1991) have suggested techniques for arttomatic disambiguation of these taxonomies based on neural net techniques, word overlap, or bilingual dictionaries. The * ThiB r~trch w~ ilupported by NSF Grant No. IRI-8811108. techniques we have used to construct a network of rialto senses autoluatically from tile Longman Dictionary of Coutenlporaly Falglish (LDOCE) differ snbst~mtialiy t+rom any of [l'tose methods.","In (Guthrie et al. 1990), we suggested and algorithm for disanlbiguating the gentls terms of nout~ definitmns in LDOCE. The procedure we nsed was based on the assumption that the semantic relationship between the headword and its genus should be reflected m their 1,1X)CE semantic categories. In other words, the semantic category of tim genus word should be identical to, or an ancestor of, the semantic category of the headword (an ancestor is a superordinate term in tire hierarchy ot semaltic codes). tJsthg a tandont saInplc of 520 noun word sanse from I,DOCE, we tested this assmnption.","The semantic categories used (them ate thirty-four in all) were detined by tile LlYOCE lexicographers, who placed sixteen of ttle basic categories in a hierarchy. The notion of a \"more general semantic categoly\" was somewhat subjective, as is illustrated in tile next section.","The disautbiguation algorithm presented th (Guthrie et at. 1990) utilized three factors in determmmg the correct gcnns sense. The algorithm is stated as follows: • Choose tile genns sense with tile same senlalltiC","category as the headword (or closest more gan-","eral category if this is not possible). + In the case of a tie, chonsca sense with has the","sanle pragnlatic c(×le \" In case there is still a tie,, or no germs sense","meeting tim above criteria, choose the most fle-","quently used sense:l: of the gemls word. :c In lh~ 2nd edition of LDOCE, rio: publidaors st¢,t~ fltat the ot'd~l\" ill which word ~lBe8 me liate~l correspondn to am fieatuency with which each ~nne i+ u~e.d (ie. the tir+t ~nae li~¢d in tile most conmmnly u~d, ate.).

Since we considered three factors in determining the correct genus sense (the semantic code relationship, the pragmatic code relationship, and the frequency information), we designed experiments to first test each factor separately, and then again in combination, weight-ing each input according to its individual predictive value. Below we describe those experiments, beginning with the formulation of each factor, and undhig with the assignment of weights to the contribution of each input in file final disambiguation algorithm. 2. Sense Selection Based on LDOCE Semantic Codes","This section describes our investigation of the use of semantic category information for disambigualion, and outlines the problems in using that type of information. The basic hierarchical strlmtum of the semantic codes provided by LDOCE is depicted in Figure 1. In addition to the codes positioned in that tree structure, seventeen other codes, which we refer to as \"composite\" are defined as follows: E = solid or liquid U = collective and animal or human O = animal or human (sex tmspecified) K = male (ammal or human) R = female (animal or human) V = plant or animal (not human) W = abstract and inanimate Y = abstract or animate X = not concrete or animal (abstract or htunan) Z = unmarked (no semantic restriction) 1 = human and solid 2 = abstract and solid 3 = \"it\" as subject or object 4 = physical quantities 5 = organic materials 6 = liquid and abstract 7 = gas and liquid","To evaluate our assumption that the semantic category of the genus word is the same or more gen-that the listing order of senses in the let edition of LDOCE is similm\" to that of the 2rid, tnd have found empirical evidence in tim work of Guo (19891 mad this Itudy to show that • simihtr connection botwtam the ord*r in which word ~n~ Jro listed And the, fr~luoney with which they arm uJcd (in LDOCE) holds for the lit edition u well. era) than the semantic category of the headword, it was necessary to define what we meant by \"more general\" for the composite categories. We did this by incorporating the composite codes into the hierarchical structure display in Figure 1, and defining a semantic distance between word senses based on the placement of their respective codes in the hierarchy. It was obvious from the start that the addition of these cedes te the tree depicted in Figure 1 would create a tangled hierarchy. The problem was to decide where these codes should be placed in the tree stnlctnre in order to preserve inheritance. For exmnpie, shenld \"E\" (the code for \"solid or liquid\") be placed above or below \"solid\" and \"liquid\", and would a similar placement hold for code 7, which reads \"gas AND liquid\" (as opposed to \"liquid OR solid\")?","T C (abstract) (coacrete)","] Q (inanimate) (animate) S L G P A H (mtid) (liquid) (gas) (plant) (animal) (l~umanl J N B D M F (movable tnotmovable (animal (animal (humnn (buntnn solid) u~l) [emale) male) male} female)"]},{"title":"Figure 1: Basic Hierarchy of LDOCE Semantic Codes","paragraphs":["To answer such questions, two types of studies were conducted. The first was an in-depth look at the words marked with composite codes (nouns marked to identify a semantic category and adjectives and verbs marked as to their selection restrictions). The second was a survey of the genus senses for head-words with composite semantic codes. As might be expected, there were inconsistencies in the assignment of nouns categories. For example, within the \"liquid\" categories, we observed that nouns which represent both liquids and solids can be found in both categories L and E, mad abstractions of liquids can be found in categories L, 6, and 7. This is not surprising, as it is difficult to create distinct categories for overlapping concepts. ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 AOt;l\" 1992 1 ! 8 8 PROC.

Results of the Experimentation","All tests of the proposed sense selectien 6riteria were mn on the same random sample of 520 definitions. Table I provides a summary of the relevant test results. Although each selection mechanism was evaluated separately, because of the large nmnber of word senses having either redundaut code markings, or no markings at all (particularly with pragmatic codes), it was necessary to introduce a default or \"tie breaking\" mechanism for all selection criteria other than usage frequency. Usage fiequency was established as the default selection mechanism for all tests. When no sense selection (or no nnique sense selection) could be made based on the criteria beiug tested, the sense selection was based on usage fi'equency (ie., of the competing senses, the sense cccurrmg first in the listing order was selected).","The variation in performance between all approaches developed for genus sense selection was relatively small - no more than 8%. Both the best mad the worst performance of a single sense selection parameter was achieved using pragmatic code relationships. The best performance (80% success rate) resulted from requiring identical code markings for headword and genus senses. The worst disambiguation performance was the resnlt of sense selection based on common pragmatic code set membership. The variation in disambiguation performance was small in the experiments which used only the semantic code information. The maximum success rate of 77% resulted fi'om stipulating common code set membership, while the minimmn success rate was 75% for identical code designation.","Some of the test results were uI~expected: for instance, we did not expect selectien of the first sense listed to yield a 76% success rate. Net did we expect sense selection based on a subset/superset relationship between codes to be as unsuccessful as it was, yielding no more than a 78% success rate for both pragmatic and semantic codes.","Although the experiments showed that a direct inatch of pragmatic codes was the most successfifl single selectiou mechanism, the result is somewhat misleading. Because many words have no pragmatic cede, the defanlt rule was applied often, resulting in the selection of the most frequently used sense, l-laving said that, it remains true that the tests show pragmatic code information to be the best predictor of the correct genus sense, when it is present.

The Final Disambiguation Algurlthm","Review of tile output data from e, ach disaarbiguation trial using tile tilrec parmncter algorithm revealed that tile majority of the failures were on a very small number of frequently occurring germs words. Often, the pragmatic and senaintic classifications of these word senses were either deficient (lacking in code information), or redrmdant (more than one word sense having the Sanle nmrkings). Such situations frequently arise with very abstract words (e.g. pat, quality, piece, arid ntmaber) where fllere are nnnlerous word seaises, and most (if not all) senses have identical semmltic codes mid no pragmatic codes.","The filial modificahon to onr gentts sense selection algorithm was introduced to solve this problenl: the correct sense selections fol words with errors in their code information, as well as certain very general words are pre-selected, and assumed to be constant. Fewer than ten words required haild coding of the correct sense and ahnoat all were abstract words such as part or quality. While it is tlue that tile majority of these words are \"disturbed heads\" (Gnthrie et al. 1990), and will, in the fnture, not seive as geims terms but rather as identifiers of alternate link types, we still require that they be sense disambignated to serve as relation descriptors.
