Lexical case is assigned in ttle lexi-COIl, whereas structural case is assigned in syntax, under tim provision that it does not override lexicai case assignment. This analysis is problematic for grammatical theories such as Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) and Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) as the introducion of a syntactic case cmnponent is incompatible with the lexicalist ideology underlying these frameworks. Furthermore, the default character of syntactic case introduces a procedural aspect into the grammar which goes against the derlarative spirit of unification-based frameworks in general. In this paper, I propose an alternative anMysis, formulated in terms of CUC,, in which all case constraints are expressed lexically and in which default reason-ing is restricted to nonmonotonic inheritance of lexicai information only.","1 Introduction: Case Marking and Defaults The Icelandic case marking system I has often been taken as evidence for a distinction between structural (or regular or default) and lexicai (irregular, quirky) case marking. This distinction is introduced to explain the following two facts. First, most verbs select nominative case marked subjects (1), but a number of verbs select accusative, genitive or dative subjects (2)- (4). Similarly, most transitive or ditransitive verbs select an accusative direct object (1), but some select a nominative, dative, or genitive (4)- (6) object. (1) Stfilkan(N) kyssti drengina(A)","the-girls kissed the-boys 1See Andrews (1982) for an extensive overview.","(2) Drengina(A) vantar mat(A) the-boys lacks food","(3) Verkjanna(G) g~etir ekki the-pain is-noticeable not","(4) Barninu(D) batnac~i veikin(N) the-child ~,eeovered-from the-disease","(5) 13g hj£1paSi honum(D) I helped him","(6) Eg mun sakna hans(G) I will miss him The fact that the vast majority of subjects and objects is nominative and accusative, respectively, is accounted for by assigning default status to these cases (that is, if nothing is said about the case of a subject or object, assume it must be nominative or accusative, respectively). Second, passive sentences (7)-(8) and so-called 'raising' constructions (9)-(12) exhibit a distinction between regular and irregular case marked NPs. In transformational terms, the case of regular case marked NPs corresponds with their surface position ((7), (9), and (11)), whereas the case of irregular case marked NPs corresponds to their underlying position ((8), (10), and (12)). (In these examples, tc represents a lexicaily case marked NP-trace and t a trace which has not been assigned case (assunfing that structural case is only assigned to surface NP positions)).","(7) Drengirnir(N) voru kysstir t the-boys were kissed","(8) IIonum(D) var hj£1pa5 tD him was helped","(9) lIann(N) virSist It elska hana] he seems to-love her","(10) liana(A) virSist IrA vanta peninga] her seems to-lack money AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~'r 1992 9 4 PROC.

(to appear), whose analysis is in many respects similar to the one developed below. Andrews' (1982, p. 485) LFG-based account, for instance, assumes two default conventions, applical)le to functional structures (that is, after syntactic processing has been cmnI)leted). First, if the subject is unmarked for case, (direct and indirect) objects are accusative by default (i.e. only if they are not lexically ease marked), and, second, an argmnent must be nominative if no other ease constraint has been imposed upon it. The application of the first convention nmst precede that of the second. Zaenen et al. (1985, p. 466) adopt a default case marking convention which appears to be restricted to the lexicon and which assigns nominative case to the highest available grammaticM function (i.e. a grammatical function which is present in the argument (or thematic) structure of a verb attd which has not been assigned lexical case), and accusative to the next highest available grammatical fnnc tiou. Zaenen et al. concentrate primarily on passives and do not present an explicit account t)f raising constructions. Yip ctal.

The default constraints for nominative and accusative case ntarking must not apply if :t lexical case constraint is present already. This ilnlflies that tit(., default constraints cannot be added to the syntactic rules or lexical entries which introduce subjects and objects, as this would make the constraints absolute. Rather, syntactic default case marking principles would have to be added as a filter on syntactic structures or as seperate default rules (much like the syntactic fi.~ature specification defaults of GPSG) whose application must be intertwined with syntactic processing a. Admitting such extensions, however, is potentially damaging to the descriptive adequacy of","3Note that the defaults cannot be 'compiled away' in this case, as is proposed for the feature specification defaults of GPS( / in Shieber (1986b).

The proposals of Andrews (1982) and Yip ~:t al. (1987) are also a challenge for lexicalist ttleories such as I[I'SG and CUC,.

These con siderations have even been used (in ,lacobson, 1990) as arguments against lexicalist accounts of case marking in generM.

Ill the next section, I in: troduce a fragment of (;Ill] including raising verbs and passives. Next, the distinction be-tweet| lexicM and structural case is accounted for by assuming that case is encoded as a feature-colnplex and by introducing a system for nonmonotonic iiflmritanee of lexical information. In section 4 I show that this deeomlrosed case system makes it possible to analyze the case patterns found in passive and raising constructions as a reflection of a partial agreement relation.

The same conclusion is reached by Sag et aL (to appear), who present an analysis formulated in terms of IIPSG (Pollard & Sag, 1987, to appear) which emphasizes the theoretical and methodologic~d advantages of a declarative, lex~ icallst, solution. Their analysis rests on the as-sulnption that case is encoded using the two featltl'e8 CASI.; atld I)CASI';~ where the latter i8 used t() encode the default c~L~(: of certain argument tmsitioas. The distinction between structured and lexical case assigning verbs is implemented as follows: Non-quirky verbs require that the DCASE and CASE values of their subjects be identified (structure-shared). Quirky verbs impose uo snch identity, and select at particular CASE value for their subject. [t is assumed that raising verbs specit~¢ that tile controlling and controlled NI' are reentraut. Note that this predicts that the case of a lexical (quirky) case assigning verb is always preserved. If a raising verb combines with a Vt'- conq)lentent which assigns structural case to its subject, the features ChS~; and D('ASE of the controlling NI' will also be reentrant. Since objects are always (lexically) specilied as [PEASE A(:C], this implies that a raising to object verb which coml)ines with a structural case assigning VP nmst take an accusative case marked object. Subjects are assumed to be marked as {I)£:ASl.; NOM] by the syntax rule which introduces subjects. Thus, raising to subject verbs that coinbine with a structural case assigning VP can only take a nominative suhject. The fact that the ca.se of subjects is deternfined at least in part by syntax is surprising, given the lcxicalist ~pproach advocated by Sag Acres DE COLING-92, NAI,rI'I~S, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 9 9 Paoc. o~, COLING-92, NN̂TUS, A~6.23-28, 1992 et al.. It is essential for their analysis, however, that subjects of infinitives are not assigned nominative default ease in the lexicon, as this would make it impossible for a raising to object verb to combine with its VP-complement 6. In the account above, there was no need to introduce syntactic case marking principles. One might even maintain that this account, apart from be-ing truly lexica[, also has the advantage that it avoids the procedural flavor of the analysis of Sag et al., which, a3though formulated declaratively, makes essential use of the fact that nominative default case is imposed during syntactic processing, whereas all other case constraints are imposed beforehand (i.e. in the lexicon). Sag et al. (to appear) do not adress the case marking patterns of passives. The most obvious way in which their analysis could cover these facts would be to assume the passive lexical rule presented in Pollard & Sag (1987, p. 215). This seems to account for the facts immediately, given the additional assumi)tion that objects are marked as [DCASI~ ACC] after passive has applied. Note, however, that this would imply a slightly different lexical component than is standardly assumed in HPSG, and, perhaps nmre disturbing, would introduce explicit order-ing of lexical rules or rule types."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Andrews, Avery (1982).
