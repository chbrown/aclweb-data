It provides reasonable criteria for determining a suitable equivalent translation or meaning by making tile dependency relation in the source language be reflected in the translated text. The method can be tractable because tile required staffs-tics can be computed semi-automatically in advance from a source language corpus and a target language corpus, while an ordinal corpus-based translation method needs a large volume of bilingual corpus of strict pairs of a sentence and its translation. Moreover, it also provides the means to compute the linguistic statistics on the pairs of meaning expressions. 1 Introduction It~ecently many kinds of natural lauguage processing systems like machine translation systems have been developed and put into practical use, but ambiguity resolution ill translation and meaning interpretation is still the primary issue in such systems. These systems have conventionally adopted a rule-ba.~ed disambiguation method, using linguistic restrictions described logically in dictionary and grammar to select the suitable equivalent translation and meaning. Generally speaking, it is impossible to provide all the restrictions systematically in advance. Furthermore, such machine translation systems have suffered from inability to select the most suitable equivalent translation if the input expression meets two or more restrictions, and have difficulty in accepting any input expression that meets no restrictions. Ill order to overcome these difficulties, following","methods .~r~ proposed these years: 1. F, xample-Ba.sed Translation : tile method based oil trans[atiou examples (pairs of source text, aml its translation) [Nagao 84, Sato 90, Smuita 90] 2. Statistics-Based Translation : the nmthod us-","ing statistical mr probabilistic information ex-","tracted from a bilingual corpus [Brown 90,","Nomiyama 9]] Still, each (ff them has inherent problems and is insufficient for ambiguity resolution. For example, either all e×amplc~b~mcd translation method or a statistics-based translation method needs a large-scale database of translation exalnpl~, and it is difficult to collect all adequate amount of a bilingual corpus. In this paper, we propose a new method to select the suitable equivalent translation using the statistical data extracted independently from source and target language texts [Muraki 91]. The statistical data used here is linguistic statistics repre: senting the dependency degree on the pairs of expressions in each text, especially statistics for co-occurrence, i.e., how frequently the expressions cooccur in the Sallle seutence~ the sanle paragraph or tile same chapter of each text. The dependency relation in the source language is reflected in the translated text through bilingual dictionary by sc~ lecting the equivalent translation which ma.ximizes both statistics tot co-occurrence in tile source and targ(~t language text. Moreover, the method also provid~ the means to compute tile linguistic statistics on the pairs of meaning expressions. We call tlds method for equivalent translation and meaning selection DMAX Criteria (Double Maximize Criteria based on Dual Corpora). First, we make comments on the characteristics and the linfits of the conventional methods of ambiguity resolution in translation and meaning interpretation in the second section. Next, we describe the details of DMAX Criteria for equivalent translation selection in the third section. And last, we explain the means to compute the linguistic statistics on the pairs of meaning expressions. ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ôf.rr 1992 5 2 5 PROC, oJ, COLING-92, NA~CrEs.

In general, these restrictions are de~ scribed logically on characteristics of another expression which modifies or is modified by the expression to be processed. For example, to translate predicates (verbs and predicative adjectives), semantic restrictions are deacribed on essential case arguments in forms of semantic markers to indicate features of words or terms in the thesaurus to show a hierarchy composed of word concepts. Though these conventional methods have been very useful to realize natural language processing systems, ttmy have the following problems:","1. It is impossible to decide the most suitable equivalent translation if the input expression meets two or more restrictions.","2. Analysis fails when the input expression can meet no restrictions.","3. Actually the practical systems depends on such heuristics as pre-declded application order of restrictions or some default equivalent translations or meanings.","4. The description of the restrictions is based on direct structural dependencies, therefore it is quite difficult to describe the restrictions based on sister-dependency or between expressions belong to different sentences or paragraphs.","5. Restrictions on any dependencies cannot be thoroughly described in advance. For example, a Japanese word \"booru\" has two meanings, one is 'a bail(a round object used in a game or sport)' and the other is 'a bowl(a deep round container open at the tap especially used in cooking)'. When this word occurs in the following sentence, it must mean ~a bowP.","JAP: Booru-nl mizu-o ireru bowl dative water obj, pour, or marker marker put in ball or fill ENG; To pour water in%o a bowl In this case, to select the meaning by the logical restrictions on dependencies, it is necessary to have described even the appearance or usage of the in-direct object of the verb \"irern\". To describe such detail restrictions on ,all expressions may be possible, but it is quite difficult because the trouble of description and the cost of calculation. 2.2 Example-Based Translation Besides the conventional translation method above, a machine translation system based on translation examples (pairs of source texts and their translations) is also proposed [Nagao 84, Sato 90, Sumita 90]. This type of system, called Example-Based Machine Translation, has stored a large amount of bilingual translation examples ms a database, and translates input expressions by retrieving an example most similar to tim input from the database. There is no failure of output in this method because it selects the most similar example not the identical one. However this example-based translation system needs a large-scale database of translation examples, and iL is difficult to collect an adcxluate amount of bilingual corpora. Even if it is possible, there is no means to divide the sentences of such corpora into fragments and link them automatically, and it costs us too much time and money to divide and link manually. Besides, this method can neither achieve precise meaning interpretation because it selects equivalent translation directly from the input expression and leaves meaning interpretation out of consideration. To overcome this problem, we have also proposed a new mechanism based on sentential examples in dictionary, which utilize the merits of both the translation by logical restrictions and the example-based methud, by selecting the equivalent translation which ha.s tlle most similar example to the input expression IDol 92]. This mechanism can guarantee no failure in selecting an equivalent translation, but the description of relations are still based only on direct structural dependencies. 2,$ Statistics-Based Translation Several new methods especially of machine translation have been proposed lately, which select a suitable equivalent translation using statistical or probabilistic information extracted from language text [Brown 90, Nomiyama 91]. Because many machine readable texts have been already collected nowadays, it is not difficult to extract statistical information of each expression in the texts semi-automatically. Moreover, the statistical information reflects the context in which eactt word occurs and implies the logical restrictions based on indirect structural dependencies. Although we call the systems in a same word \"statistics-based translation\", statistical information used in the methods is diverse, such as translation probability, connectivity of words, statistics for (co-)occurrence, etc. We make comments on the characteristics and the limits of these systems. The first method uses fertility probabilities, translation probabilities and distortion probabilities [Brown 90]. Fertility means the number of the words in target language that the word of ttle AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOOT 1992 5 2 6 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES. AUG. 23-28, 1992 source language produces, and distortion means tile distance between the position of the word of the source language and the one of the target language. Tile method has been applied to au experiinental translation system from French to English. How ever, since these probabilities are extracted from a large amount of text pairs that are translations of each other, this method must be suffered from tile santo difficulties ,as examplc~b~sed translation in collecting and analyzing an adequate amount of bilingual corpora, and it's very difficult to apply this method to the languages whose linguistic structures aren't similar each other, such as English and Japanese. The second method uses tile statistics for occurfence in target language text [Nomiyama 91]. It is calculated ill advance how frequently the each expression occurs in the t~rget language text, which needs only to belong the same tiehl as the source language text beblngs, but not to be a translated text of tile source language text. If there are more than one possible equivalent translations, the most frequent translation is selected through this calculated data. Moreover, this nrethod can be applied to make good use of the conventional methods of selecting equivalent translations, tbr it employs the frequency data exclusively when logical restrictions cannot select one out of candldates. However this method hms one big problem. The high frequency of the expression in the target language text may not originate from the frequency of the expression in the source language text to be translated, because one target language expression does not correspond to only one source language expression ill general.

In this case, the statistics for co-occurrence in the target language English text denotes that the most frequent pair is 'court-judge', because the word ~COllr|' also lneans a qaw court'.

These source and target language texts don't have to be translations of each other. The proposed method gives us a way to select tile expression with the highest frequency of the target language text that keeps high frequency of the source language text at tim same time, so it overcomes the difficulty of the method using the frequency data on the target language text only, because it does not select the expression with the highest frequency of only the target language text.","~The subject phrase \"watashi-wa\" = T is omitted in this sentence.

The bigg~t problem of this method is that Tbj which depends both b and j is selected by only statistical data on the targct language text. Our new method provides reasonable criteria for selecting the basis for the equivalent translation selection using the statistical data on the source language text. First the source language expression Sb which maximizes the statistics for co-occurrence in the source language text 4 is selected, then the equivalent translation T,i which maximizes the statistics for co-occurrence in the target language text 5 is selected. The dependency relation in the source language is reflected in the translated text through this method. We call this method for equivalent translation and meaning selection DMAX Criteria (Doable Maximize Criteria based on Dual Corpora). ~,.2 Double Maximum Criteria based on","Dual Corpora The algorithm of this method is summarized as follows:","1.

Figurc 1 and 2 are examples of Japanesc~Engllsh translation. In Figure 1, with only statlstic,t] data on the target language text, ~court' may be chosen as an equivah;nt translation of \"kooto\" because tim pair of 'eonrt-judge' co-occurs most frequeatly in the target language. However with DMAX Crite rio, the equivalent translation of \"kooto\" is selected correctly. • The expression which co-occurs with \"kooto\" most frequently in the source language is • The pair of the equivalent translation of \"kooto\" and the one of \"nekutai\" which co-occurs most frequently in the target language is 'coat tie'. • As a result, \"kooto\" is translated into 'coat'. It is the same ms shown in Figure 2. A pair of 'basket ball' co-occurs most frequently in the target language. But using DMAX Criteria, giv-ing attention first to the most frequent pair in the source language text, \"kotori-kago\" cart gain the correct equivalent translation 'cage'. Next, a pair of \"mizu-booru\" decides 'bowl' as an equivalent translation of \"booru'. Finally, correct trauslation can be acquired in this way.

However in conventional systems the meaning selection mechanism isn't robust and cannot select the most suitable meaning only by logical restrictions described in the dictionaries. We presented a new method for the equivalent translation selection in the former chapter using statistical data on source language and target language through bilingual dictionary. To apply this method to meaning selection, it is necessary to calculate statistical data on the pairs of each meaning in advance, but there is no means of calculating them automatically. We have already devdoped an interlingua-based machine translation system whose interlingun named PIVOT doesn't depend on arty particular natural language [Muraki 86, ichiyama 89, Okumura 91]. In its dictionary, a.s illustrated in Figure 4., expressions in the source language are mapped onto some interlingua vocabularies (CONCEPTUAL-PRIMITIVE:CP), which are next mapped onto some equivalent translations. Then we propose a new method of computing linguistic statistics for occurrence of meanings automatically using this format of dictionary. Suppose linguistic statistics on the pairs of expressions in both source and target language texts have already been calculated. In case of translation, when an expression Si occurs in the source language text, an equivalent translation Tij k is decided through the passage of Si :=*'Cij ~Tij~, and as a result, CPCIj is also selected from the CPs corresponding to the expression Si. Therefore, the linguistic statistics on the pairs of CPs or meanings is nothing but coupling linguistic statistics on the pairs of corresponding exl)ressions in the target language text. Thus, the linguistic statistics ~Z on the pairs of the meaning expressions in the dictionary can be obtained as the sum of the linguistic statistics w on the pairs of target language oxpressious according to the following equation.","fi(C.,,Cb,,) = ~wm(Ta.,v,T~,,,q) p,q This linguistic statistics can be added to the dictionary in advance I and we c~n select the meaning in the same way as equivalent translation selection."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We lu'oposed a new method DMAX Criteria (Double Maximize Criteria based on Dual Corpora) in this paper. It can select a suitable equivalent translation or meaning using the statistical data extracted from both source and target language corpora even when linguistic restrictions described in the dictionary or grammar cannot. The depen dency relation in the source language is reflected in the translated text through bilingual dictionary. Moreover, the nmthod has the following features:","1. It utilizes linguistic statistics as context infer motion in addition to logical restrictions effective for ambiguity resolution.","2. The source of the linguistic statistics is the dual corpora of source and target languages, not the bilingual corpora (the target language text doesn't have to be the translation of the source language text).","3.
