Background","'Fhere are sew~ral things thai a representation of relational inforniation should do, and ease does them all, but not w',ry well. 1.1 Tit(,.

Yet there are many dimensions of similarity, and any set of cases will account for only some. This call be seen by considering the fact that many prepo sitions, for examl)le \"with\", hal/e meanings which span several eases (Tsujii £'. Yamanashi 1985).","Moreover, similarities of meaning do noi always line tip with similarities of meaning. For example, whm~ a.ssigning a ease to \"w~nd\" in \"the wind closed the door\", syllta× suggests agent, as does the seman tic feature 'no-covert controller', but the the selnal]tic feature 'liot-allilllate' suggests that wind is an mstruillellt.","For two languages the problems gel, worse; choosing a set of ea.ses to capture the generalizations of one language tends to obscure the generalizations of another. To use another old exanq)le, a definition of agent that works well for English will not suffice to rule out inanimate subjects in Japanese.","A representation for relational information should be good not only for capturing similarities (general izations) but also for precise representation, llere too,","l thanks Dan aurafsky, atom Edwards, Toshiaki llisada, m~d Mitaul)iahi lleavy lnduntries. ctLse often comes/i l) short.

To illustrate this with a spatial metaphor, a par,it ipatory profile can be identified with a point in an n-dimensional space, which I will call 'c~me space', where the axes are the ea.se features. Figure 3 shows an impressionistic projection of this space onto two dimensions, populated with sentences about John, positioned appropriately for his role in them. Super imposed on this with curved lines is a suggestion of the way that a traditional ease account might divide up this space. This illustrates how case allows only a relatively coarse description, providing only the opportunil, y to describe a participant's role a.s being in a certain region of the space.","This proposal Mso makes it easy to explain simi larities. For e×ample, comparing the roles of \"yeasl\" in \"yeast makes bread r~se\" and \"spoon\" ill \"eat with a ,spoon\", they are similar in that both are concrete and directly acting, but different it, that the yea.st is not manipulable, nor is it identifiable as a sep~- rate entity afterwards. Profile representations of the roles of yea.st and spoor, can show that they are similar on specific stlared dimensions, while not obscur in K the differences on other dimensions. Profile representations also make it easy to quantitatiwdy describe similarity on a single dimension. For example, it is possible to describe John as active in both \"John .~peculated t~i commodities\" and in \"John watched the ducks\", but somewhato less active in the latter; there is no forced choice between assigning John to a case where he is active and one where im is not.","(-'.~se is traditionally considered to be a cla.ssific~ Lion of tile semantic relations between predicates and their arguments, but the proposal replaces it with an account of the roles of participants in events. In some languages things like. individuation or definit, e ness, which would seem to have nothing to do with the verb, affect choice of ease markers and constructions (Fillmore 1968; flopper gz Thompson 1980). q'hus it seems that meaning relations should relate to the sit ua,lion, Ilot just to the predicate. (Here 'situation' is meant in a narrow sense (DeLancey 1991), where \"John asked Mar# to leave\" involw~s two situations.) 2.2 Profiles and Language","Iamguage refers to regions of case space.

Instead we can define these inlplicit/y by reference to their prototypica[ meanings.

Proximity to prototypes can then be computed. This allows, for example, the simple rule: 'for subject, select tire partieipam which is closest in case space to the prototypical subject' (to slightly modify a proposal by 1)nwty (1991)). As sonic fitctors are more important than others, it is appropriate to as-sign weights to the various case features, to bias the computation of proximity. For example, the weights for subject shown in Figure 5 account for subject selection (in the context of the system described in Section 4), explaining: la) John kissed Mary lb) Mary made the boy eat a peach lc) Mary was kissed by John (if she is the topic in the larger context) ld) the wind broke a dtsh le) Mary was killed and Mary died This account of subject is more parsimonious than a subject hierarchy, that is, a list of cases in order of preference for which can become the subject (Fill-more 1968), plus rules for overriding it for tire sake of topics. This description also ohviat, es the need for explicit statements that topicness is more important than agentivity or that volition is more important than activity; such facts are simply encoded in tire weights.","In the current implementation of ease space, the range of values for each feature go front -1 to +1. Whereas participants can be located at any point in the space, it seems appropriate to site prototypes at the corners or edges of the space. A few more exan|- pies of profiles are shown in Figure 4, arrd many more in Ward (to appear). 3. Related Work","Although the synthesis is novel, many of the major components of the proposal have been previously proposed, if in somewhat different guises and for different purposes For exaanple, Cruse (1973) and Delaneey (1984) studied the components of various meeming relations, Labov (1973) and Miikkutainen and Dyer (1991) pioneered the use of vector spaces for describing meaning, Hopper and Thomp son (1980) showed how to relate grammatical reflexes to lists of scalar-valued paxameters (features), Ilinton (1981) noted the possibility of using a 'distributed representation of roles', Tsujii and Yamanashi (1985) viewed cases in terms of prototypes and their exten sions, Fukuda et al (1986) and Pederson (1991) in-troduced the spatial metaphor for meaning relations, and Dowty (199t) explained how to relate grmnmatica[ relations to prntotype structured clusters of meaning relations. 4. Implementation","1 have built a parser (Ward 1992) and a generalor (Ward to appear) which use participatory profiles. This section discusses the generator, not as a presentation of the best or only way to use profiles, but merely as a demoastration that case profiles are workable.","FIG, a 'Flexible Incremental Generator', produces English and Japanese sentences starting from a meaning representation, using spreading activation in a knowledge net, work. One task of a generator is, given an input including some items with case profiles, to build a sentence whose syntactic form and function words reflect those e~e profiles.","In FIG case features are implemented ms nodes in the associative network. They are linked to constructions and words, with appropriate weights. For example, the node responsible,, has a link to the node by,,, representing the word \"by\" , and this link fias weight +1.","The participatory profiles of concepts in the inpnt are represented by links to nodes for case fi~atures, appropriately weighted. For example, the node for Mary may have a link with weight .5 to responsible, to represent a given mput.","For such an input, when mary,, becomes activated, case features will become activated to the de gree appropriate for her profile. In tnrn byw and other prepositions will receive actiw~tion from these case features. The net effect is that the profile for a participant activates prepositions proportionally to their proximity m case space to that profile. (The measure of proximity computed is, to be precise, the dot product of the vector for the participant and the vector for the prototype.) The preposition whose pro totype is closest will receive the most activatiou, mid hence appear in the output. Like ease markers, coltstructknls receive activation from the profiles of participants, via case features. They thus become mobi lized to the extent that there is a participant with a profile matdring that of the construction. (Some case markers appear before the word they flag, others after, and so FIG has a distinction between activation fi'oni the profiles of concepts which remain to be expressed and activation from the profile of the concept just expressed.)","Constituents which involve profiles also are linked to nodes for case features; from these activation flows to concepts, and so the concept whose participatory profile is closest to that activated by a constituent will receive the most activation. (Actually the case feature nodes used for activation flow from constituents to concepts are distinct from those used for activation flow fronl concelpts to ca.se markers and constructions. That is, each case feature is implemented a.s a pair of nodes; this is for technical reasons.) There are multipie profiles in any non-trivial conceptualization, and ACRES DE COL!NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 nOLq\" 1992 1 1 4 0 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 it wouht seem that crosstalk aright be a problem, but this has not been the case in F[G, primarily hecause generally there is one eoltsLruction an(l one (:oncepi with enough actiwttion to dominate.","FI('~ originally expected deep (:as(: relations in its int)uts , and its grmnrnar and lexicon referred to those cases. One problem was that, ~s I extended 1,'lG's coverage of the two langllages, the nnlnher O[ cil~ses kept growing and the grammar got uglier and uglier. In t)articular, there were lengthening lists of possible cases for constituents, for example there was at llst of fonr possible cruses to nse for subject. Switching to proliles solved these problems. Conversion wa.s relatively easy; other than the new references to profiles, the grammar did not need to be changed. Tim additional eomi)utation required is negligible.","FIG currently uses 10 (:~use fi~atures: volitional, responsible, active, aflheted, direet-cause, partial cause, individuated, topic, object of-force, and touched; these replace the e~Lses agent, instrument, patient, experieneer, cause and percept. At this point the meanings of the cause features derive less from their flames than from the way they are related to the con structions of Jat)anese and English. This is hecause tbe numeric values for the t)rofiles, although originally chosen according to comlrlon sense arid with reference to the literature, tlaw~ had to i)e tuned in the course of making FIG able to generate sentences in both Inngnages for a largish mmlber of inputs. I ascribe no special significance to the particular set of profiles enrrentty in nse: they are specific to FIG's current gramtnar and implementation details. 5. Summary and Hopes","To summarize the advantages of the prof)osal: Participatory profles are a representation mech~vnism that allows both precision and generalization-capturing. Precision is important for being able to tel)resent accurately the information that people (:an get from langnage, and it will probably also he use ful for artificial intelligence systems in the near fu lure. Better generalization-capturing allows siml)ler amt better grammars. Tbis is important for linguis tics, and also for comtmtational linguistic, where the cash vahle will be inq)roved manageability and performance for natural language systems. One example is machine translation. If the parser/mMerstander arrives at a narrow enough eaqe profile for a participant, then it is lmssible to directly find the relewmt target language constructions t)y cornputmg in which regions the point lies. It shouhl thus he posslhle to eliminate the need for contraative knowledge relating the regions of the various constrnctions and words of the two languages.","Judging from my experience converting FIG to profiles, these advantages may be easy to achieve in practice. Of course, to conre u t) with a general theory of relational information will require a great deal more work, both on the mechanism and on the analysis of language.","This f)ropc,sM is in some ways a logical continuation of Fillrrtore's (19681 research i)rogram. Fill-more wanted to capture linguistic generalizations in terms of meaning, not syntactic structures, hi Ward (forthcoming) I suggest that a processing model can dispense with surface syntax struetures also; doing without csse eliminates yet another type of interme diate structure typically interposed between thought aml hmguage, allowing an even more direct account of linguistic generalizations in terms of meaning."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Cruse, 11.
