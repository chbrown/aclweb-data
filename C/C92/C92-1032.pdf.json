On this basis, it has been ~rgued [A J91, JL83] that by identifying processing load with space utilization, we can rule out both top-down and bottom-up parsing as viable candidates for the human sentence processing mechanism, attd that left-corner parsing represents a plausible Mternative.","Examining their arguments in detail, we find difficulties with each presentation.

A top-down enumeration of the left-branching tree clearly requires storage proportional to n, tile height of the tree: at the point when Z is enumerated, each of A, B,..., X remains inemnplete because its rightmost child has not yet been encounteredfl The same holds true for the center-embedded structure: using a top-down enumeration, each of A, C, D, ..., X remains incomplete until the subtree it dominates has been entirely enumerated. In contrast, the top-down strategy requires only constant space for tim right-branching structure: each of A, C .... , X becomes coruplete as soon as its rightmost child is enumerated, so the number of incomplete nodes at any time is at most two. We conclude that if the human sentence processing strategy were top-down, people would find increasing difficulty with both multiply left-branching and multiply center-embedded constructions, but not with right-branching constructions. The evidence exemplified by (1) suggests that this is not the case.","A similar analysis holds for the bottom-up strategy. The left-branching structure requires only constant space, since each of X,..., B,A becomes complete as soon as both children have been enumerated. In contrust, enumerations of the right-branching and center-embedded constructions require linear space, since every leftmest child remains incomplete until the subtree dominated by its right sibling has been entirely enumerated.

If increased memory load is responsible for increased processing difficulty, as we have been assuming, then both the bottom-up strategy and the arc-standard left-corner strategy predict that people have more difficulty with right-branching than with left-branching structures. Our conclusion is the same as for the top-down strategy: the asymmetry of the prediction is not supported by the evidence.","On the other hand, arc-eager enumeration makes a critical difference to the left-corner strategy when applied to the right-branching structure. Recall that the left-corner enumeration of nodes for this structure is BADC .... Notice that after node (7 has been enumerated, arc (A,C) is introduced immediately, and as a result, node A is no longer incomplete. In general, the arc-eager left-corner strategy will enumerate the right-branching structure with at most three nodes incomplete at any point. ~ktrthermore, as was the case for the bottom-up strategy, the left-branching structure requires constant space. We see that only tile center-embedded structure requires increased storage as the depth of embedding increases. Thus of the four strategies, the arc-eager version of the left-corner strategy is the only one that makes predictions consistent with observed behavior. 2.2 Two Problems Under the assumptions made by Abney and Johnson, the discussion sketched out above does make a case for a left-corner strategy being more psychologically plaitsible than top-down or bottom-up strategies. However, there are two difficulties with the argument as it is presented.","First, by abstracting away from parsing algorithms and placing the focus on parsing strategies, Abney anti Johnson make it difficult to fairly compare space requirements across different methods of parsing. With-out a formal characterization of the algorithms themselves, it is not clear that their abstract notion of space utilization means the same thing in each case. 3","~br example, consider the augmented transition network (ATN) in Figure 3, where the actions on tile arcs are as follows: II: npl ~ * I2: result ~ (S (npl *)) 13: dell ~ * 14: result ~ (NP (dell *)) I5: result ~ a I6: result ~ the Uppercase are labels represent PUSH operations, and lowercase labels represent terminal symbols. In the pseudolanguage used here for are actions, npl, dell, 3] am grateful to Stuart Shleber for this observation. a(t5) tl~ (16) Figure 3: Fragment of an ATN and resull are registers, the leftward arrow (+--) indicates an assigmnent statement, the pop arc transmits control (aud tile contents of the ~esalt register) to the calling subuetwork, and the asterisk (*) represents the value so transmitted (cf. [WooT0]). So, for instance, action I4 constructs an NP dominating the structure in the ddl register on tile left, and, on the right, tile noun structure received on retnrn froln a push to tile N subnetwork.","Now~ tile ATN is perhaps one of the mo~t common examples of a parser operating in a top-down fashion. Yet according to the definitions proposed by Abney and Jolmson, the enumeration performed by the ATN parser given above would seem to make it, an instance of a bottom-up strategy. For example, in parsing the noun phrase the man, the ATN above wonld recognize tile determiner the, then the nonn man, and finally it would build and return the structure [,vthe man] from the NP subnetwork. The source of difficulty lies in the decoupling of the parser's hypotheses from the structures that it builds. When the determiner the is encountered, no parse-tree structures have been built, but the mechanism controlling the ATN's computation has stored the hypotheses that we were parsing an S, that we had entered the NP subnetwork, and that we had subsequently entered the DET subnetwork. These correspond precisely to the nodes we expect to see enumerated during the course of a top-down strategy.","One could, of course, choose in this case to identify the space utilization of this parser with the hypotheses rather than the structures built. Itowever, that leaves the status of the structures themselves in question. More to the point, re-characterizing tile storage requirements of a particular algorithm is exactly the sort of manipulation that the abstract notion of parsing strategies should help us avoid.","Tile second difficulty with Abney and Johnson's discussion concerns the distinction between arc-eager and arc-standard strategies. As they point out, for both top-down and bottom-up strategies, the two forms of AcrEs i~ COL1NG-92, NANYES, 23-28 AOflr 1992 1 9 3 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUO. 23-28, 1992 arc enumeration are indistinguishable. In addition, left-corner parsing with arc-standard enumeration is, at least for the purposes of this discussion, virtually identical to bottom-up parsing, having no distinguish-able effects either with respect to space utilization or even with respect to the hypotheses that are proposed.4 So it seems somewhat odd to introduce a distinction between \"eager\" versus \"standard\" when it turns out to distinguish only one of six possible combinations (top-down/eager, top-down/standard, etc.). The question of exactly what \"eager enumeration\" does would seem to merit further attention. We shall give it that atten-tion shortly, in Section 4."]},{"title":"3 Comparing Automata","paragraphs":["Abney and Johnson's argument is largely an independent account quite similar to one made earlier in [JL83].

He concludes that the symmetry of human performance on left- and right-branching structures counts against the top-down mid bottom-up parsers, and that the left-corner p~trser is a viable alternative that appears to be consistent with the evidence. He then provides a more formal characterizatiml of the various parsers by expressing each as a push-down automaton (PDA).

Top-down filtering restricts the non-determinlstic choices made by the parser, bat does not affect the bottom-up construction of the parse tree along a single computation path. remedies the first difficulty we found in [AJ91]: the formal specification of each parsing algorithm permits us to express space utilization uniformly in terms of the automaton's stack.","The top-down and bottom-up automata behave exactly as we would expect. The stack of the bottom-up automaton never grows beyond a constant size for left-branching constructions, but is potentially unbounded for center-embedded and right-branching constructions. The top-down automaton displays the opposite behavior, the size of its stack size being bounded only for right-branching constructions, s","Of particular interest is Johnson-Laird's construe-tion of a PDA for left-corner parsiug, which we consider in more detail. The stack alphabet for the left-corner PDA includes not only terminal and non-terminal symbols from thc grau~nar, but also special symbols of tile form [X Y], where X mad Y are nonterminals. The first symbol in such a pair represents tile top-down prediction of a node, and tile second a node that has been encountered bottom-up. The use of these pairs permits a straightforward combination of left-corner prediction, which is bottom-up, and top-down prediction and matching against the input in the style of a top-down automaton.","tiere we consider an extremely simple left-corner automaton, constructed from a grammar having the following productions: (1) S ~ NP VP (2) NP ~ John ] Mary (3) VP ~ V NP (4) v -~ nke~ The rules of tlle automaton are as follows: [ .

These are, in fact, precisely the two VPs in the symbol [VP VP].

As long as we have not identified the two views of VP as the same node, the arc is not enumerated --- and the parent S remains incomplete in the sense defined by Abney and Johnson, It is rule 9 in the automaton that effects this identification: popping [VP VP] amounts to recognizing that the top-down view and the bottom-up view match.

To summarize thus far, [AJ91] and [JL83] present two forms of the same argument, but each presentation suffers from a central shortcoming.

Johnson-Laird, ibrmalizing parsers as push-down automata, provides a characterization that clearly defines the terms of the comparison, but his left-corner automaton lacks the properties needed to make the argument succeed.","Modifying the left-corner automaton so that it per-forms arc-eager enumeration is straightforward. As discussed toward the end of the previous section, \"attachment\" of a node X to its pareut occurs when the symbol IX X], representing the top-down and bottom-up views of that node, is removed from the stack.

It is that the \"arc-eager\" enumeration strategy is a different (and perhaps mislead-ing) description of a purser's ability to perform composition on the structures that it is building.","If we describe the parsers as sets of inference rules rather than automata, s the inference permitting arc-eager enumeration in the left-corner parser turns out to be a rule of composition: A ~ c~ • B and B ~/3 . 7 can be composed to form the dotted item A ~/3 . 3'. For instance, the effect of rule 8' is to predict VP V • NP from V, and then immediately compose this new item with S --, NP . VP. Equivalently, the rule first predicts the VP structure in Figure 4 from the V (giving us [VP VP], corresponding to the two VP nodes the figure), and then immediately identifies the lower VP node with the upper one (which removes [VP VP]), leaving just an S structure that lacks an NP. STwo descriptior~ that are formally equivalent.","In contrast, even if one were to add a rule of composition to the inferential description of top-down and bottom-up parsers, it would have no effect. Neither the top-down nor the bottom-up parser ever introduces a configuration in which the A constituent and B constituent are both only partially completed (and thus can be composed). Instead, these parsers rewrite the entire right-hand side of a rule at once (see Figure 5). In order for a rule of composition to be relevant, it is necessary that the parser introduce both the top-down view of a constituent (e.g. B in A ---* ~ • B) and the bottom-up view of that constituent (e.g. B in B ~ ft.3)̀ so that they may later be identified. Unlike top-down and bottom-up parsers, a left-corner parser meets this criterion.","By presenting a complete version of the argument in [AJ91] and [JL83], we have essentially re-discovered proposals made by Puhnan [Pu185, Pul86] and Thompson et al. [TDL91]. Both propose parsers with left-corner prediction and a composition operation added. Pulman motivates his purser's design on grounds of psychological plausibility, though he does not present a complete version of the argument discussed here. Thompson et al. are motivated by issues in parallel parsing. In addition, we should note that Johnson-Laird introduces a parser with a composition-like operation later in his discussion, though outside the context of a formal comparison among parsing methods.","Abney (personal communication) points out that, though psychologically plausible in terms of the space utilization argument we have discussed, the automaton presented here may nonetheless fail to be plausible because of its behavior with regard to local ambiguity. If we opt to compose whenever possible (e.g., always preferring rule 8' to rule 8 when X = VP), which seems natural, then left-recursive structures will lead to counterintuitive results -- for example, in processing (2), the automaton will prefer to attach the NP the cat as the object of the verb, rather than waiting for the full NP the cat's dinner. 2 John prepared [[tlm eat]'s dinner]. More generally, as Abney and Johnson discuss, there is a tradeoff between storage, which is conserved by strategies that perform attachment \"eagerly,\" and ambiguity, which is avoided by deferring attachment until more information is present to resolve it. On the basis of the observations we have made here, it appears that this tradeoff is expressed most naturally not in terms of a comparison between different parsing strategies, but rather in terms of the criteria for when to invoke a composition operation that is available to the parser.

We have demonstrated difficulties with both of their for-mulations and presented a more precise account. In so doing, we have found that composition, rather than left-corner prediction per se, plays the central role in distinguishing parsing methods.","In making the argument, we were forced to abandon the abstract characterization of parsing methods in terms of strategies, and return to defining parsers in terms of their realizations as automata. This has the unfortunate consequence of tying the argument to context-free gramnrars, losing tire attractive fornralismindependent quality evoked in [AJ91].","Since context:free grammars are no longer generally considered likely models for natural language in the general case [Shi85], one wonders how the discussion here might be extended to parsing within more powerful grannnatical frameworks. It is interesting to note the relationship between the style of left-corner parsing described here and one such framework, combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) [Ste90]. Composition is an integral part of CCG, as is the notion of type-raising, which resembles left-corner prediction. 7 The operation of a left-corner parser with composition can fairly be described as being in the style of CCG, but retain-ing the context-free base. Since one attractive feature of CCG is its inherent left-to-right, word-by-word in-crementality, it is perhaps not surprising to find that parsers of CCG tend naturally to meet the criteria for psychological plausibility discussed bere.","CCG is one instance of a general class known as the mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms [JVSW88].
