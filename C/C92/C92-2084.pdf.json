THE SOLACE","As a shortcut towards a lexicon of reasonable coverage we decided to build upon an available machine readable dictionary, which we intend to augment later by hand and from other sources. Our primary source of English lexical data is now CUVOALD, or the Expanded Computer Usable Version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Cul.rent English, 3rd edition (OALD, Hornby, 1974), w}Kch is available from Oxford Text Archive (see Mitten, 1986) 4 . CUVOALDIists all headwords, headword variants and derivatives with simple codes denoting word classes and inflection patterns, supplemented by verb pattern codes for verbs. Sense distinctions from OALD are not retained.","Where~q the derivation of lexical information as needed by the analysis from CUVOALD word class codes is relatively straightforward, the OALD verb pattern codes, which are crucial for our purpose, present a real challenge. The dictionary classifies verbs according to the number and form of complements in%~ 51 \"verb patterns\", marked by numbers 1-25, supplemented in some cases by letters (4A,4B,4C,4D,4F). The number of verbs in a single pattern is quite variable: starting from a single item in [VP4F] for he followed by an infinitive up to 4855 standard transitive verbs in [VP6A]. A pattern groups together verbs which exhibit the same behaviour in a standard context and are subject to the same set of transfor~tions under specified conditions. So e.g. the class of intransitive verbs [ VP2A] can take introductory there and postpone the subject if it is indefinite and \"heavy\" : There comes a time when we feel we must make a protest. A single pattern is also used for verbs which allow the same mot phesyntactic variations of a complement. ( [VPI] : She's dark~in good heal th/here/a pretty girl. ) A different verb pattern is, however, used if only a subset of the relevant class perndLs the variation. ([VP6C]: She en~oys swimmir~g / *to swim. vs. [VP6D] : She likes swim~ting / to swim.) Some vat iatio~kq may be treated as a different verb pattern. (This is the case of the above example: She likes swimming. [VP6D| and Site likes to swim. [VPTA] )","Akkerman (1989) lists several shortcomings of the OALD verb patterns. As Sampson (1990) noted, some of them are arguable. For our purpose, the most proble,~tic seems to be the treatment of compound verbs ( with the resulting loss of infor.~tion in CUVOALD) and too surface-level definition of some verb patterns. These classes are quite a heterogenous collection: by [VPI4] are marked verbs in all of the following uses, the only requirement being that the verb is followed by a noun and a prepositional phrase: They accused him of stealing the book. I explained my difficulty to him. Compare the copy with the original. Another \"misbehaved\" pattern is VP4A where, depending on the verb, the infinitive can be complement or adjunct: The ~winm~er failed to reach the shore. lie came to see that he was mistaken. She stood up to see better. Apart from these \"systemic\" blemishes we expect a number of other inconsistencies and errors to appear during t}~ process of derivation and use of the target lexicon.

THE DE}{IVATION","CUVOALD was not pri.~rily intended for use with a syntactic parser, so a few modifications were necessary. First, the pronunciation field was deleted and homograph entries with different pronunciations r~erged. ( In CUVOALD, each word, or word form, has only one entry, unless it has two different pronunciations. ) Second, entries headed by regular forms within irregular paradigms as headwords were also deleted. And finally, reference to base forms was provided in entries of all the remaining nonbase (irregular) forms. Base forms of irregular paradigms were marked by a code specifying the paradigm type. After that, we tried to find a way how to derive the complementation paradigms.","Ideally, templates o f the sort described in Section 4 should Correspond to OALD verb patterns while lexical rules would account for structures listed in Hornby (1975) as variants of the same verb pattern. Although this idea works in t}~e case of the most frequent patterns ( [VP2A] , [VP6A] ) , there are many patterns where the relation between pattern and paradigm can be l:n, n:l, or even n:n (n > I) (see Section 3).","The case of n patterns : i paradigm reduces the number of paradigms and as such is a welcome situation. The case of 1:n can mean (i) ambiguity for all verbs listed under the pattern (and c~n possibly be accounted for by lexical rules) , (ii) the possibility to subdivide the verbs of this class into n subclasses, or (iii) a combination of the two. For (il, the derivation of complementation paradi~l from a verb pattern will yield a disjunction. For (ii) , verbs with different complemenration paradigms should be distin-ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO't3\"r 1992 5 5 6 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 guished. Boguraev and Briscoe (1.989) used valency codes in Ii)0CE (Lon~gnan Dictior~ary of Contemporary English) to autematical]y extract the (explicitly unmarked) distinction between Equi and Raising verbs. Similar approach can be tNed to ,~ke this and other distinctions in OALD by taking into account co-occurences of verb pat terra.

The current efforts include the specification of lexica] values of particles and prepositions for compound verbs and assigning verbs n~rked by verb pattern codes such m~ VP14 to relevant subclasses.","The correspondences between the OALD patterns and complementation paradigms are stated in the simple cases by rules relating one or more patterns to one or more paradigms - templates. Where possible, frequently co-occurring verb patterns are collapsed into a single paradigm with local disjuction, e.g. [VP61)] and [VPTA] for like (swimming/ to swim) give the following template: [ transitive, { 2ing / 2inf }, equi ], which expands into: SC < [I] N[nomb ,","[ 21 V[{prespartl inf} ,SC<N3>]4 > , SF [ suBJ [11 , OBJ lZl ] , US [ GOV like , ACI' [3] , PAT [4] ]","Now t~re are two possible strategies representing two extremes. The first strategy disregards the actual distribution of verb patterns in the dictionary and atten~ts to combine results of rule application into a compact and meaningful complementa-Lion paradigm. The second strategy starts from a list of all combinations of verb patterns within the dictionary and assigns a rule to every combination. Let us look }mw the first approach works.","The process of derivation of a complementation paradigm for a verb entry consists of the following steps: 1. Application of rules rewriting a verb pattern code (or more verb pattern codes if the resulting paradigms can be related by a lexical rule) by a template or a sequence of templates collected by logical operators \"and\" and \"or\", the result may be marked by one or mere lexical rule names. Rules rewriting n~re l~tter~ are preferred to those rewriting fewer i~tterns. A rule may be, supplemented by a condition stipulating the presence or absence of' other paradigi~ within the same entry. A rule whose condition is satisfied is preferred to a rule wJ thout condition. Verbs with patter~ which do not, corresl~nd to a single complementation i~radigm while co-occurring verb patterns do not indicate a preference ibr one paradigm or the other have to be treated ,~nu~lly. 2. Simplification of templates by making as local as possible. the sequence of all disjunctions 3. Consistency check performed by expansion of the sequence of templates into feature structures.

However, to make a decision, some statistical analysis is necessary.","CUVOALD lists 5695 verbs with 633 different combinatioi~ of verb patterns. ~ 4853 verbs (85.2%) are marked by one of the 56 most frequent combinations (each occurring seven and more times). The first ten most frequent combinations are given below: verb patterns frequency 6A 1971 2A,6A 575 2A 338 6A,14 331 2A,2C 165 2A,3A 137 6A,15B 101"]},{"title":"2A,2C,6A","paragraphs":["I00"]},{"title":"2A,2C,6A,15B 81 3A 64","paragraphs":["At the other end, t~re are 442 combinations occurring only once, 191 two and more times, 119 three and more times and 77 five and mere times.","Another survey was aimed at finding most frequent combinations as proper subsets of the full combinations treated above. E.g. the combination of three patterns 2A,3A,6A occurs alone in 54 entries, but as a proper subset of a larger combination already in 566 entries.","From the above data it seems that a compromise between the treatment of individual verb patterns and of entire combinations would be most efficient. 119 combinatio~ can already be treated by individual rules quite comfortably while the rest can be composed from results of rules applied independently, where more alert supervision is required. It also seems feasible to use the rules for combinations to treat parts of the remaining lists of verb patterns, ar~ perhaps add a few more, se#ected according to the second statistics. 6.
