The main linguistic advantages of such a forlnaiisnl are that: - it provides u larger donlain of locality than CFG-based formalisms such as HPSG or LFG, - it allows factoring recursion from tile domain of local dependencies, - as a consextuence of both above properties, it allows the grammar to be totally lexicalized (Schabes et al, 1988). However, a certain number of syntactic phenomena are difficult to represent in this framework. We focus here on French pronominal citrics which are cases of non canonical argufnen[ realization. We show how they can be naturally handled using the \"Synchronous TAG\" extension of the formalism as a turther set oi wellformedness conditions on tbe language and we extend this treatment to uther cases of inisnlatch betv,,een syntactic attachment and senlantic role. 1. Motivation French pronominal clitics have 'been subject to numerous studies in both thexwetical and computational linguistics.

BSs et al 1989 give a slightly modified version of this treatment allowing for what they cu!l French \"semi-free\" word order. Miller 1991, using a HPSG-style framework, considers clitics as \"phrasal affixes\" on VP and uses optioual lcxical rules to update the subcategorization frame of the corresponding verbal entries and foot features to keep track of the presence of a clitic in the tree. He accnunts lot a lot of non local dependencies (including causative constructions) but needs extra constraints to handle locality constraints. He does not talk about inverted clitics nor dislocated constructions. This treatment is not, to otlr knowledge, implemented in a computational application. 1.2. Difficulties with existing TAG vari,'mts We can first put aside \"fi'ozen\" clitics which are easily handled in Lexicalized TAGs: they do not play any semantic role and \"co-head\" the elementary trees of their predicate (\"impersonal\" il, se in \"middle\" constructions anti various idioms). Clitics with a semantic role (adverbial modifiers or arguments of a verb, an adjective or a noun) are more difficult to handle. One could think of adding to the existing tree families (associated with the predicams) an elementary tree (with a substitution node for the citric and an empty argument node) for each possible citric (or clitic combination) realiz,ation. This would be somewhat uuprincipled and","5 lead to numerous extra trees , unless one generates the new trees by metarules or lexical rules (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992, Becket 1990). It would also separate the syntax of adverbial ctitics from that of argumeutal ones attd disallow many non local dependencies. One might also considcr cxtensious of TAGs, such as FOTAG or MCTAG variants. In Multicomponent TAGs, used for extunple by Kroch and Joshi 1986, the elementary units of the grauunar are tree sets (notexl hcrc with braces) instead on single trees. Adjunction (or substitutimt) thus becomes simullaneous adjuuction (or substitution) of the different members of a tree set into a tree (or into the members of another tree set).

Pairing with semantic flees for Jean and NO dorrmr The links between syntactic and semantic nodes mean that an operation at one node in the syntactic tree has an equivalent combination at the linked node in the semantic tree (and vice versa). More precisely, the semantic interpretation of a sentence is built \"synchronously\" with its syntactic derivation, by choosing a pair of elementary trees (a syntactic one:T1, a semantic one:L1) from the grammar and repeatedly updating it as follows (Shieber and Schabes 1990): - choose a link between two nodes nl and n2 in the pair (T1, L1), - choose another pai r of trees (T2 and L2), the root nodes of which match the respective categories of the two nodes chosen above, - form a new pair by combining T2 at node nl and L2 at node n2 and remove the link (if T2 and L2 have links, these are preserved in the resul0. The definition allows for the operations performed at each node to differ, one being an adjunction and the other a substitution for example. It also allows for a node to be linked to several other nodes: in this case, only the \"consumed\" link is removed (the others are preserved and 7. See Shieber and Schabes 1991 for some arguments for the use of trees instead of flat structures in Logical Form, and for the use of adjunction as an alternative to substitution in LF. 8. We refer the reader to Schabes ct al. 1988 for more details on LexTAGs. Suffice here to say that the TAG elementary trees are systematically associated with lexical \"heads\" anchoring them in the lexicon (and required not to be empty) and are combined together either by substitution or adjunction. Feature structures are also associated at the nodes of the elementary trees and constraints on combining trees can be expressed in terms of success or failure of unification (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1988). Not all featur/:s are shown here. 9. The non terminal names in the semantic TAG are mnemonic for Formula, Term and Relation. Only the relevant links are shown. we adopt here the convention that they are \"pushed\"","• . . 10 upwards m the case of an adjunctton) . Since multiple links are allowed, one syntactic node may be linked to .several semantic nodes, and conversely, one semantic node to several syntactic nodes. This allows for the ability of a given syntactic element to play different semantic roles and for differeut syntactic realizations of the same .semantic role. For example, as explained by Abeill6 and Schabes 1990, this formalism naturally accounts for file adverbial status of adjectives inserted into idiomatic expressions: Jean a pris une vraie veste = Jean a vratment pris une veste (Jean has really come a cropper). We want to show here that, provided it is taken as part of the well-formedness conditions of the grammar, it also accounts for the properties of French pronominal citrics. 2.2. Augmenting TAG wellformedness conditions with synchronicity Sofar, well-formed sentences of a TAIL have been defined in the syntax only• In this respect, an input sentence is accepted by the TAG parser iff it obeys the following conditions: - it can be derived from an initial tree rooted in S, - all features unify at each node in the corresponding derived nee. It is however possible to allow for the definition of the well-formed sentences of the language to be given jointly by the syntax and by the semantics, so that among the ill-formed sentences certain will be accepted by the syntax but rejected by the semantic rules if they cannot assign any interpretation to them. Such semantic filtering is not without history (Cf Pullum 1984) but it seems especially fruitful with the Synchronous TAG formalism because: - the syntax and the semantics use extactly the same formalism, - the syntactic and semantic derivations are necessarily built up in parallel. The following well-formedness constraint is thus added to the parser: a sentence is acceptable iff it has at least one valid semantic interpretation built \"synchronottsly\" with it. By valid semantic interpretation, we mean that: - it can be derived from an initial semantic tree, - all features unify at each node in the corresponding derived semantic tree. Several linguists have also suggested such semantic filtering for cases usually thought of as more syntactic (e.g. Sag and Klein 1982). The purpose of this paper is to advocate this device in various cases which all involve the syntax-semantic interface among which French pronominal clitics, 2.3. French pronominal elitics with Synchronous TAGs We rely on the existing elementary trees in the grammar to which we add substitution nodes for all possible clitics.

A motivation tor treating cases (7c) and (Td) (i.e, cases of argument missing or cooccurrence between clitics and full phrases) as \"semantically\" deviant is that it seems to be always possible to construct a context in which they could be accepted 11. We thus consider all the argument nodes to be optional and compatible in the syntax, their realization will be incompatible in the semantics (and might be obligatory if the semantic representation specifies so), Handling elitic corresponding to PPs is now straightforward, as shown in the following pairing: S F"]},{"title":"Jr---- A\\ (NO) ~I V2 (PP) ..---.,o I/j dat>=+ I 6 N. /","paragraphs":[".-/ Figure 6.

The same result could be achieved if one considers the elitics to be adjoined (instead of substituted) on the syntactic side but this will necessitate a richer feature system to check clitic ordering and compatibility (see Abcill6 1991a for a previous accomtt along these lines). In order to keep the feature system as simple as possible, we provide in fact nodes for all possil)le clitic realization (argumeulal or adverbial ones) in the corresponding elementary trees. The complete tree for a transitive verb like voir is thus the following (with clitic numbering as in section 1.1) I 2:","S Figure 7. Elementary trees for NO voir NI.

This representation is also directly suitable for marking various constraints, e.g. structural ones (ruling out en direct object for PP complements) or lexieal ones (verbs which forbid cliticization of their complement such as pen.wr & Nhum or aimer que P). As for feature equations, certain links are structurally defined as part of the elementary trees reg,'u'dless of their lexical head (and there will be no link between en and the T complement node in the tree family for verbs with a PP complement), other links are brought by the lexical head and only certain verbs with a PP complement (ressembler but not penser) will define a link between the dative Clitic and their T complement node. We now show how the representation sketched above naturally extends to some cases of so-called \"non local\" dependencies and to cases of cooccurrence between the clitic and the corresponding argument. 2.6. Locality constraints and non local dependencies. As noted by Shieber and Schabes 1990, locality constraints are inherent to the formalism of Synchromms TAGs. Contrary 1o Miller 1991, who runs the risk of allowing too many non local dependencies with the FFP, we titus do not need to add specific locality constraints. Notice first that some \"non local\" dependencies in a PSG are treated locally in a TAG framework. Examples of these are sentences with raising verbs (adjoining to VI) or attxiliaries (adjoining to V0) following the word order : Jean peut le voir, Jean l'a vu. Adjoining a raising or an auxiliary verb only updates tile links coming out of the Vl or V0 node and does not interfer with the links of the clitics. We straightforwardly get: Jean aurait dtd aimd de Marie= Jean en aurait dtF aimF (Jean would have been loved by Marie).

Agreement pattern for transitive verbs Cliticization of the complement of an adjective is directly allowed in copular consmtctions: Jean estfidele g~ Marie = Jean lui est fiddle (Jean is faithful to Marie). Copttlar constructions are (independently) treated as extended elementary trees in the TAG grammar, with the adjective co-heading the elementary tree with the verb and the chic and PP(de) complement nodes belonging to the","i4 same flee . However, such cliticization is ruled out lin modifying adjectives. Sentences snch as: J'ai rencontrF une fille fidOle d Jean = * Je lui ai rencontrd une fille fidOle (I met a girl faithful to Jean) are not generated since the T node corresponding to the complement of the adjective does not belong to the same semantic tree as that of NO rencontrer N1 with which the clitic tree must be cmnbined. The same \"local\" treatment holds for cliticization of complements of nouns. It is allowed in light-verb constrnctions such as: Jean a fair le portrait de Marie = Il en afait le portrait (Jean made a picture of Marie), which are represented as exl~nded elementary trees with the light verb and the predicate nominal co-heading the slructure. It is rulod out by our treatment when the NP is in a","15 productive argument position 14. There are differences in acceptability for cliticization with verbs taking adjectival arguments : Je lui (sais + ?*trouve) Jean fiddle. (I know]find Jean faithful to her). The difference is the same for extraction out of tile AP : A qui (sais+ ?*trouves)-tu Jean fidt?le ? and is acounted for by different syntactic elementary trees (an extended one for savoir, one with die AP to be substituted for trouver). 15. This is obviously too strong a constraint since there are cases where tile clitic corresponds to a complement of a noun at an arbitrary levet of entbedding, such as: Le bord de la couverture de ce livre est ddchir~e = Le bord de la eouverture en est ddchird (The ctmler of lhe cover of the book is tom out).

In such cases, the determiner heads a syntactic N initial tree but its solnantic tree is an attxiliary T tree which adjoins to the T node filled by the clitic. We also account lot cases where the dative (humml) clitic is semantically equivaleot to a l}ossessive, a construction typical of nouns of inalienable possession (such as t×xly parts) combined with certain action verbs: Ce docteur selene les dents de Jean = Ce docteur lui soigne les dents (This doctor treats JeAufs teeth), llere, the clitic lui will paired with an auxiliary T tree (as that for possessive determiners) and its node will be linked wilh tile T node of the direct comlllement (for tile verbs allowing this): it may thus cooccur with Ihe NP COlOpleiIlcnt. For lack of space, we do uot develop here Ilclitic climbing\" in causative constructions which require either multicomponent trees on the semantic side or lexical rules adding causative double-headed elementary trees to the existing tree families. 2.7. Cuoccurcence between clitics and I'11tl phrases Such c{×}Ccorrences are exhibited by inverted contexts such its: Qui Jean voit-il ? Such inverted clitics are represented ia the syntax as auxiliary trees which trigger an mversiou feature (Ahei116 1991 a) and adjoin to the right of tile inflected verbal form. On the semantic side, they are reprcsented as ambiguous: they are associated witii Terms and may thus alternate with uon inverted clitics or NP suhjccts (Qui voit-il ?), provided the verbal nodes are linked with the subject T uede. But they are also associated with auxiliary trecs adjoining a question marking at the top F node (and thus allowed to cooccur with NP subjects). Otlrer cooccurrences are exhibited hy dislocated constructious such as : .lean, Marie l'a vu or Marie l'a vu, Jean (Jean, Marie saw) which tend to gencralize in spoken language.

For example, tile above dislrihution with the noun venue is accounted for by linking the attactonent l×}tht of the determiner (the top N) and the substitution node {11' the PP complement tO one and the S~lllle snbstitlltiou node in tile","18 corfespondillg senlantic tree :"]},{"title":"/I (~P~) ~\" TO~","paragraphs":["Figure 11.

Conclusion We have shown how some non canonical arguments can be naturally handled using the formalism of Synchronous TAGs, provided the syntax-semantic synchronicity is incorporated as a well-formednesss condition in the grammar. We have applied this treatment to French pronominal clitics and handle the; r complementary distribution with complements, without increasing the number of elementary trees in the grammar. Thanks to the extended domain of locality of TAGs, their locality constraints are handled (similarly as subjaeency) without specific stipulations. We also handle cases of non local dependencies, provided one adds alternative semantic representation for ambiguous clitic complements. The same idea can be extended to other cases of mismatches between syntactic attachment and semantic role, such as \"extended\" adverb scoping or exWaposition. References A. Abeill6 1988.
