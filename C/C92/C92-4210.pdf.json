O1: COLING-92, NAN-n!S, Auc;. 23-28, 1992 of individual lexical items. It is semantics that we concentrate upon in this paper. Many attempts have been made to use traditional dictionaries in order to assign word senses to general semantic categories, cf. [1]. Our LDB contains semantic information that cannot be elicited from the existing dictionaries. The priority is given to semantic features influencing lexieal or grammatical cooccurrence. In this paper possibilities are discussed of predicting selection~l restrictions, syntactic features and other formal characteristics of the utterance - such as the array of arguments and their semantic interpretation, the meaning of an aspeetual form of a verb etc., - on the basis of semantic features of a word in the lexicon. The main advantage of a lexicai database as compared with a traditional dictionary consists in the fact that a database makes it possible to present semantic information in a format enabling the computer to locate efficiently various types of information specified for a given class of words. To put it differently, the main advantage of a database consists in the possibility of compiling lists of words possessing a common feature or a set of features. There are three main principles that the system is based upon. 1. We are convinced that semantic features of words determine co-occurence to a much greater extent than it is usually acknowledged. In other words, we claim that many aspects of syntactic subcategorization of lexical items are predictable from their meaning. 2. A semantic feature of a word is essentially a semantic component (or components) in its lexieographic definition. 3. A great amount of information about the meaning of a lexical unit; about its combinatory possibilities; prosody; referential features; or about its regular ambiguity, need not he stored in the dictionary: this information be-longs to wi~at may be called a grammar of lexicon and should be formulated in a generalized form. In this form it can be stored in a Lexical Knowledge-Base of semantic and syntactic regularities. This Knowledge-Base has not yet been designed, but semantic features of words in LDB are conceived as an input for general rules that will be stored in this hypothetical Knowledge-Base."]},{"title":"2 Lexical Database for Concrete Nouns","paragraphs":["There are different layers of lexicon that require specific formats of a database, and the choice of the format is one of the main problems of database formation.

We do not mean that the system of semantic features wouhl provide a word with an exhaustive texicographic delinition - this is not the appropriate task for a lexical database. Tire purpose of a database is to highlight those semantic aspects of a word that unite semanti eally cognate words and differentiate many of semantically different words from one another. In othe.r words, lexical database is an instrument of predicting and calculating all sorts of usefifl semantic classes of words. Domains ILl and II.2 specify MereologieM status of a word (more precisely, of a lexeme - namely, of a word taken in one of its lexical meanings). The wdues of the feature I1.1 may be: PART, SET or WII()LE. In the later case dommn 11.2 is emtrty while in the tlrst two cases it specifies the WIIOLE for the PART and the ELEMENT for the SI';T: I'ART (SI';T) of what? E.g., (1) krylo 'all' M-status I PART Of what { body (2) stado 'herd' M-status I SF/I' Of what ]animals (3) ehelovek 'man' M-status I WflOI,E Of what I - I)omain 1[.3 provides a lexeme with a taxonumic supercategory, such as Person, Plant, Animal, Metal, Building, Sphere of activity etc. Tiffs domain is of primary importance arrd it is tlds domain that defines the most interesting classes of concrete ]exenle8. The systenl of taxonomic categories h~ a hierarchical structure. Thus, the possibility is provided to state imo plieative (lelmndencies between categories, so that the lower category inherits all the information from the category of a higher [rwel. E.g., T. eategol'y (osobnjak 'private residence') = dora 'h<)use'; T-category (dora) - postrojka 'building'; T-category (postrojka) sooruzenie 'construction'. Thus, lexeme osobnjak will be assigned not only to the class of houses but ~dso to the class of lmildings and to the class of constructions. Domain II.4 specifies a Predicate semantically connected with the noun in question. It turns out that such predicates occupy the nr()st prominent place in lexicographic definitions of a great majority of concrete nouns. Usually these are predicates that determine a standard way in which the corresponding object is used ACRES DE COLING-92, NAN'rE.S, 23-28 ôt;r 1992 1 2 9 7 PROC.

There are also nouns that imply a non-functional predicate in ttteir lexicographic definition - a predicate that determines its characteristic property, cf. Predicate (liquide) = to flow. Some nouns require predicates of both types, cf. Predicate (cellar) = 1) to store products; 2) digged under the floor of a house. For some classes of nouns Domain 1.4 Predicate is empty, e.g., for some (not all!) names of the so-called natural classes and for the names of parts of the corresponding objects, cf. krab 'crab': M-status I WHOLE Of what I - T-category ] animal Predicate ] - Inclusion of predicates into a lexicographic definition of concrete nouns may be considered an attempt to fertilize theoretical lexicography with the ideas of frame semantics. Domain II.5: Predicate may have a Restriction as for the range of possible taxonomic classes of its arguments, e.g. khishchnik 'beast of prey' M-status [ WHOLE Of what [ - T-category] animM Predicate I to eat Restriction I animal The Database for Concrete Nouns is ready for demonstration.

Example 1. As was stated earlier, domains II.1, II.2 define the following relations: 1) PART-WHOLE; 2) SET-ELEMENT. There are propositions that differentiate these two relations; thus, combinations in (a), with PART-WHOLE relation are possible with a preposition U, while combinations in (b), with a SET-ELEMENT relation, are not: a. nozka 'leg' U stula 'chair' pugovica 'button' U paljto ~coat' b. *chaschka 'cup' U serviza 'service' *korova 'cow' U stada 'herd' ACTES DE COLING-92, NAr, rrEs. 23-28 ôt~'r 1992 1 2 9 8 Paoc. ol, COLING-92, NANTES.
