Introduction The key to good reasoning is a powerful representation system that is able to accuratcly model details of a problem. Once a good represent.at,on has been established, problem computations often be-come straightforward. I¢~ecent advances in situation theory [BP83,Bax89] and the theory of intentions [Bra87] have offered ninny new insights on significant problems found in natural-language understanding. However, these the-aries offer philosophical approaches only, and do not give instructions for building concrete reprcsentation and reasoning engines. At the same time, the software systems that have been built for reasoning and representation fall short in any ruunber of areas. Production systems and semantic networks can follow chains of inferences, but can only represent one possible world at a time they cannot reason with states that are both possibly true and possibly not true, while keeping the chains of resulting inferences separatc. Most plasl-nets work with limited possible worlds, but callnot reason and perform inferences across multiple worlds at the salne time. The classical ATMS 1 call represent and reason with multiple timeless possible worlds, but calmot represent actions [dK86]-in particular, nonmonotonic actions where a retracted state is both believed'to be truc in the world before ttte action takes place, and believed to be not true in the world representing the situation after the retracting action has taken place, camtot be represented. In addition, the ATMS only represents propositions that are in-stant'steal constants or Skolem constants; it does not represent uninstantiated variables. A modified ATMS that can represent nonmonotonic transitions between worlds has been developed [MN86], but this system does not explicitly represent situation types and instances, action events, nor nondeterminism. Most plan inference systems have ignored free will and the 1Aanumption-13tmed Truth Maintenta*ce Systenl [dK86] explicit representation of the right to choose actions, e.g. to choose to he uncooperative. Almost all prcvious systems |lave ignored the nondetermimstie quality of real-world actions that aecessitatcs commitmeat ill intentions. Real actions call result in one of several possible outcomc situations, where,xs alolost all previous systems are are completely unable to model uondcterminlstie outcomes. Only dccision-analysis systems have modeled cxpected wdues of actions, alnl they do not support inferencing. See [BL85] fi)r an excellent summary of issues. Tile B-SURI~ (Believed Situation and Uncertain-action Representation Environment) packagc is an implemented system that supports representation, phmnmg, decision-making, and,plan recognition using probabilistic ,and uncertain actions with non detcrministic outcomes in multiple possiblc action worlds. Situations, states, and action events ,axe all represented explicitly, using types (wtriables) and instances. The B-SURE systcm is iml)lemented as a series of extensions to a classical ATMS. The resulting system is very useful, and is being used in plan recognition, intentional agent, and scheduling research."]},{"title":"2. Situation Theory","paragraphs":["In [BP83], situations are divided into the categories abstract and real, and also into the categories \"states of affairs\" alid \"courses of events\". Abstract situations denote situations that are mental representations. All the situations discussed in this paper are \"abstract situations\". Real sitnations denote situations as they actually are in the real world. Since it basically never makes sense to talk about real situations in tile computer, there is no need to snpply these in a representation environment. \"States of affairs\" correspond to situations that axe static, called simply situations in this paper. \"Courses of events\" correspond to situations that describe actions that are being executed, called action events or actions in this paper. Barwise and Perry also make use of \"rela-tions\" defined over '*individuals\" and \"space-time locations\". This paper takes as primitive the expression of a relation, which will be termed a stats. The user is free to mention individuals or space-time locations in state descriptions as desired. State descriptions may be represented nsing logical forms, feature structures, or other methods~sinee the contents of states are not used by B-SURE except for output, it does not matter.

Intentional Action Theory","One model of intentions states that an intention is a choice to perform an action, plus a commitment to obtaining its desired outcome[CL87]. With deterministic action outcomes, there is no real need for endeavoring [Brag7], since once the action has been started, it is guaranteed to finish properly. Many planners in fact operate in this \"fire and forget\" mode. However, once it is acknowledged that action execution is in fact nondeterministic and can have undesirable outcomes, the need for endeavoring becomes clear. The planner must predict the likelihood of possible outcomes happening, and judge which action sequence offers the best chances. It must interactively maintain a history of past endeavors and results, and modify its future behavior based on current outcomes. Acting intentionally becomes significantly more interesting and realistic with the explicit representation of possible chains of nondeterministic actions. 4. Previous Efforts DeKleer [dK86] presents the first ATMS. Morris and Nado [MN86] present an ATMS that can represent nonmonotonic transitions, but do not handle probabilities, uncertainties, explicit situation types, state types, nor action events. Tile research of Allen (e.g. [AK83, A1187]), who uses a predicate-calculus representation, offers some of the best multiple-worlds (deterministic) action representation in this field. Charniak and Goldman [CG89] use probabilities and Bayesian nets to represcnt the truth value of probabilistic statements and attack story understanding. Although nondetcrministic-outcomc actions are not represented, and Bayesian nets cannot support global inferencing with nonnronotonic actions, their work is important. Norvig and Wilensky [NW90] comment on problems of probabilistic statements. \"1'he most similar work is recent research by Rao and Georgeff (e.g. [RGgl]), who use a modal logic instead of an ATMS to represent nondeterministic actions. 5. B-SURE Entities & Implementation The underlying ATMS works with nodes, assnmp-tions, and implications (justifications). See [dK86]. A slate consists of a proposition about the world. States are primitives. A situation is a set of positive and negative (withdrawn) states. An action event represents the state that \"execution of the action has started\". States, situations, and actions have types and instances. See figure 1. (The abridged representation of figure 1 is shown in figure 2.) Existance of an instance in a world always implies existance of its type. A chooses node is an assumption associated with an action instance that represents whether an agent chooses to execute that action or not. The chooses assumption together with the starting situation instance imply the action instance. Since an agent typically can only execute one action in a given situation, the situation's ensuing chooses assumptions are rendered mutually exclusive (pairwise \"nogood\"). Action types have precondition situation types. Action instances are instantiated from types by first verifying that the precondition situation type is believed true in that world. Action instances transition from a starting situation instance to ouc of a number of known nondeterministic outcome situation instances. Actions have transitions. A transition has an outcon,e situation and a probability or an uncertainty. An uncerlaiuty is defined as a probability random variable of range I0, 1] together with an associated second-order probability distrilmtion. Uncertainties are initialized using maximum-entropy theory, and get updated as outcome observations are taken, to en-able the system to learn and estimate possible probabilities. See Section 6. Uncertainties are used to represent confidence in likelihood values and to make decisions regarding information-gathering activity. The calculus of uncertainties is too complex to explore further here, and is not required for understanding tile mum capabilities of the representation; probabilities are sufficient. Transitions can be types or instances. ACRES DE COLING-92, NANIT~. 23-28 AOt~rr 1992 9 6 2 PROC.

A negative state is retracted by making the situation instance and the state's \"not-rctrasted yet\" ,assumption mutually inconsistent, and deleting the state's assumption from the outcome situation's environment history. A state type or instance or situation type's belief value in a particular world is found by testing that node against a situation instance's environment history. Situation types and instances can have values. Actions can have costs. The expected value of an action is determined by summing the transition probabilities times the expected values of the outcome situations, when known, and subtracting its cost. Tim expected value of a nonvalued situation instance is determined by maximizing the expected values of the possible subsequent actions, when known. In this manner, decision theory determines the course of action with the maximum expected value at any one situation, for a planning agent. This can bc used to predict the probable next course of action of a planning agent by an observing agent performing plan recognition (actually, \"decision recognition\") [Mye91]."]},{"title":"6. Probability Estimation","paragraphs":["The probability of an outcome situation i occurring following performance of an uncertain action is estimated using the new estimator ~ instead of ~, where m is the total number of previously observed trials of that action type, k~ is the previously observed number of ith situation-type outcomes, and n is the number of known possible outcome situations from that action. The new estimator is optimal. It represents the center of mass of all possible probabilities, instead of the maximum-likelihood mode; it converges faster and on average is more accurate than the old estimator; and, it can be used accurately with small sample numbers and small snccess counts [Mye92]."]},{"title":"7.Maintaining an Interactive History","paragraphs":["One important advantage of the B-SURE system is that not only can it be used for hypothetical reasoning about future events, but the same structures can then be used as a history mechanism for interastively monitoring and representing the history of the actual events as they occur. A user system should start out in a known situation, which is presumed actual. Typically, the user system will use B-SUrtE to explore many different nondeteeministic-action sequences and make decisions ~s to which actions are tile best ones to perform. The system will then start executing the first action m tile chosen sequence. At. this point, tile user system should instruct tile B-SUItE system to presume the chooses assumption associated with tile chosen action being executed, which will change its truth value from \"possibly believed true\" to \"delinitely believed true\". If the chooses node has already been made inconsistent with other chooses nodes (because the user-system or agent could ouly perform one action at a time), those other nodes are automatically rendered \"believed not-true\" at this point. The presumption of the chooses node renders the associated implied Action Event instantiation \"definitely believed true\" at this point, ,also. This represents the fact that the action has stated and is currently being execnted. When the action finishes, it is necessary for the B-SURE system to realize which outcome occurred. This is typically performed by the system setting up a"]},{"title":"recognition demon","paragraphs":["that is attached to a separate state or situation type that, when true, reliably indicates that a given outcome has occurred. When the demon fires, it presumes the outeome's happens assumption. It is important to ensure ttlat one and only one recognition demon fires. Alternatively, tile user can control presuming the happens nodes directly. When a single happens assumption is presumed, it automatically renders its sibling happens assumptions \"de~init ely believed not;-tzale\". The combination of tile happens node being presumed and the action event node already being believed true renders the appropriate resulting situation instance believed true. Note that if any instance becomes true, so does its associated type node as well. At any one point in tinm, the states, situations, and action event instances that have happened in the world already are believed true; and the situations and events that have not happened yet but could happen are believed possible. In this way, the system maintains a timehne history of the situations and action events that have in fact occurred, while allowing hypothetical planning and exploration of possible future events in the same data structure. It is not necessary for the system to maintain only a single timeline history. It is possible to maintain disjoint histories, to represent e.g. progress made by different processing agents, progress made in different domains, or progress made at different hierarchical levels of abstraction. It is possible to maintain forking (nondisjoint) histories if this makes sense, and tim mutual exclusion options have been turned off (see Section 10).

He has a choice between asking for taxi directions, or requesting the office to send a shuttle-bus out directly to give him a ride. The shuttle will take him directly to the conference on time. If he requests and the office turns him down, he has a choice between taking a taxi, and taking the regular bus. These cost ditferent amounts of money and have different chances of getting to the conference on time. See figure 3. The plan inference system must predict which paths of information he will explore, i.e. what he will say next; and then which decisions he will make for his actions. This is done using \"decision infcrence\", by understanding which action trees offer the best expected value based on the value and chances of outcomes. Note that the shuttle-bus, the taxi, and the regular bus will all three allow the researcher to possibly obtain his desired goal, but there are definite preferences. The system should not remain uncommitted.

This means that the traditional plan-recognition model of assuming that the hearer automatically understands the semantic content of the speaker's utterance is fallacious. The speaker, and the system too, must consider the case in which the hearer does not understand an utterance. Since the speaker wants and intends to communicate specific information 2, the speaker will endeavor to ensure that the information is communicated, by repeating an utterance when it is not understood. Thus, speaking an utterance is a nondeterministie ac-Lion; it, is unclear whether the hearer will uuderstaald or not.

If required, a morphologicd analyzer will derive multiple possible analyses candidates for each input candidate. A pattern marcher will then recursively apply a body of patterns to each analysis candidate. Each pattern has a series of transfer-driven translation templates; each template has a series of prototypicai exmnple bindings. The highest-ranking structure of matching nested patterns and their bindings are sent to a template marcher. The distances between the pattern bindings and the template examples for each pattern in the structure are compared using a thesaurus. The template with the closest match for each pattern will be used to assemble a translation. It is the responsibility of the BEHOLDER system to schedule this activity in an opportunistic fashion on multiple processors. There is no need to continue to explore a branch if a good translation has been found. The BEH OLDER system must use value-of-information theory and decision theory to determine which process branches to explore next and when to stop. The BEIIOLDER scheduler uses the B-SURE system to keep track of which processes are running and which have been executed. Using this representation, it can plan ahead and decide how useful it is to expand a particular path of execution. As processes are started, the chooses nodes are presumed.
