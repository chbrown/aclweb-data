The user can iuterectivel~ correct errors in analysis results, such as dependency and case. However, without a ]earning mechanism, the user must correct similar dependency errors several times. We discuss the learning mechanism to utilize dependency and case information specified by the user, We compare four types of matching methods by simulation and show non-restricted best matching is the most effective. 1. Introduction","In the current machine translation system, users cannot always get correct translated sentences at the first translation. This is due to the low ability of the grammar rules end low quality of the dictionarY. Woreover, the grealar rules and the dictionary need customization for each document of varying fields and contents. It is very difficult to prepare beforehand the information corresponding to various fields.","NEC has developed a machine translation systea \"PlV0T\"(Jepanese to English/English to Japanese) as the translation support systea for business use. The translation part of PIVOT is the rule-based system and adopts the interlingue method. PIVOT provides a special editor so that the user can correct the analysis results. The user can interactively select suitable translation equivalents, can correct dependency, case (semantic relation), and so on. In technical manual documents which ere the main objects of machine translation, there ore many expressions that appear more than once. The analysis results of such expressions are often the sane. At present, PIVOT has learning functien for selection of translation equivalents, but it does not have such mechanism for dependency and case. The user has to correct many similar errors in dependency and case, so a heavy burden is laid on the user. Information give~ by the user can be regarded as customizing information for the document to be translated. There-fore, for o practical use system, it is an important issue to provide a framework to improve translation by using correction information froa the user.","There are various approaches for analyzing seutences by using accumulated dependencies. One system automatically extracts all dependencies which have ne ambiguJty[5]. Another system accumulates only the dependencies which are directly corrected by the user [2]. In 8lure et al.[4J, the s~stem accumulates all dependencies in the sentence that are corrected or confirmed by the user.","There ere two ways for remembering the keys in the dependency structures to he accumulated: one by the spelling and the other by the semantic code. However, the rougb selantic code used in the current system does not have high distinguishing ability, end often causes bad influence. For example, consider the following sentences. lie looked at the singing man with opera glasses. lie looked at the man who is singing with the aicrophone. The seaantie code \"Instrument\" is usually assigned to \"~-~ ¢~(opera glasses)\" and \"~4 ~ (microphone)\". Therefore, it ien't possible to fix dependence relation such as \"~5(singing)\" with \"~4¢(microphone)\", and \".E~(look)\" with \"#\"~P~X(opera glasses)\".","In the process of using learning results there is an approach that adopts best matching by computing siailarity with accumulated inforaatioo[i3. The examplebased approach that translates by retrieving examples and calculating siailarity has been investigated. These systems also adept best aatching[l][6][7].","This paper proposes an approach that can ilprove the translation quality b~ interactively accumulating dependency and case structures corrected by the user. In the learning process, the syntactle head, tile syntactic dependent, and the ease between them are stored in the association database. $o avoid side effects, head and dependent words are stored in the form of spellings. This makes it easier for the user to understand the behavior of the system. Four types of matching methods are examined that ere used in matching betgeen the possible analysis structures and the association datebase.","Section 2 describes analysis editing function in PIY0T/JE(dapanese to English). Section 3 explains the learning mechanism, and the results of simulation on actual manuals are presented in Section 4. 2. Analysis Editing Function","The user can interaetively ~peeify the following information related to dependency relation by using analysis editing function of P1VOT/JE.

OF COTING-92, NAt.S, AUO. 23-28, 1992 (5) Sharing The dependency relation which the system analyzes is displayed on the screen as shown in Figure 1. An under-line is drawn under each Japanese phrase (a word ~itb s particle). The dependency is shown by the line which connects tmo phrases. The thick line indicates the dependency corrected by the user. Case is displayed on the line of the dependency in the form of the particles which have one-to-one correspondence with one of the cases. The bo~ indicates the correct case specified by the user. The user directly corrects above-mentioned information by using a louse and carries out translation operation once again. The translation rule controls the analysis to reflect the correction by the user. Figure I: Display of Analysis Result 2.1 Dependency","The user can correct dependency.

Scope means the phrase sequence in which only the syntactic head has dependency relation with other phrases outside of it. 2.5 Sharing","In Figure 1, \"~(user)\" is the subject of \"~ (specify)\" and at the same time it is the subJect of \"l~(translate)\". In such a case, we say\"user\" is shared by \"~ (specify)\" and \"~'¢-$ (translate)\". Specification of sharing is done by specifying more than one syntactic heads for the dependent. So the sharing is decomposed into dependency relations.","Useful information on dependency relation is gotten from the user's specification of scope and so on, but this paper discusses learning from correction operation for dependency and case onlY.","3. Learning Mechanism Proposed learning mechanism is as follows. 3.1 Learning Process (1) PIVOT analyzes a source sentence. (2) PIVOT displays the analysis result. (3) A user corrects mistakes in the analysis result. (4) After the user finishes asking corrections, PIVOT","translates the sentence again. (5) PIVOT asks the user whether translation has been a","success or not, (O) If the translation is s success, PIVOT stores the","analysis result together with the instruction item","into an association database. If the translation is","a failure, PIVOT does nothing further.","3.2 Applying Process","(I) PIVOT analyzes a source sentence,","(2) If there is ambiguity at s certain stage of analysis, PIVOT retrieves data in the association database.","(3) PIVOT compares the possible analysis structures of the given sentence with the analysis results accumulated in the association database.","(4) PIVOT selects the analysis structure that matches with the analysis results accumulated in the association database. If no matching occurs, PIVOT selects one structure by further application of the analysis rules.","PIVOT learns correct analysis structures related to user's instruction.
