We have worked on JPSG with Prof. Gunji, and also have developed a parser based on an efficient mechanism for dealing with constraints[3, 4, 10] to show that JPSG is effective even for the computational processing of natural language. In the next section, we briefly introduce JPSG the-ory. Following a simple characterization of relative clauses in Japanese language in section 3, we disscuss the variety of acceptability in secton 4, and describe its formalization in terms of constraints among the grammatical features in section 5. And in section 6 we will claim that there is a constraint on tile number of slash elements and show tile supporting facts."]},{"title":"2 Basics of JPSG","paragraphs":["This section describes a brief introduction to JPSG, which is a grammar formalism originally for the Japanese language. As with IIPSG, JPSG is feature based and constraint based grammar. 2.1 Features Grammatical categories are represented as sets of features. We list the features used in this paper. (1) Features used in this paper pos (part of speech) same ms in IIPSG. gr (grammatical relation) takes either subj, obj, or","iobj as the value. subcat (subcategorization) designates the set of cat-","egories (complements) that a particular category","(head) requires. Though we have to distingush","two types of complements (is., agglutinated or","not) in Japanese, for simplicity, we assume that","subeat designates tile both types of comple-","ments. dep (dependent) designates the category that a par-","ticular category (adjunct) modifies. core roughly corresponds to CAT feature in tlPSG","[8]. Tim value is a set of features including sub-","cat feature and so-called head features such as","pos, gr and dep. slash designates a syntactic gap within the gram-","matical category involved. sere (semantics) designates the semantic representa-","tion of the grammatical category involved. In this paper, categories are designated by a left square bracket (\"[') followed by an indefinite number of feature specifications (a feature name followed by its value) separated by commas(\",\") followed by a right square bracket (\"1\"). When the value is null or not relevant, the entire feature specification can be omitted. The sharing structure is indicated by variables such as X, Y,..., which is distinguished by an initial capital letter as in programming language Prolog. Finally, a category of the form [core {pos c, ... } ..... sere s] is often abbreviated as el...]:s. Because grammatical relations play no role in or-dering complements in Japanese, we assume only a binary-branching phrase structure schema as seeu in the next subsection. 2.2 The Phrase Structure Schema and Gram-","matlcal Principles We are assuming three basic phrase structure schema for Japanese: complementation, adjunclion, and co-ACTES DE COLING.92, NANTES. 23-28 AO~'r 1992 1 1 0 0 PROC.

Coordination M ~ tit II2 where M stands for an arbitrary mother category, C a complement, lI a tread category, and A an adjunct. Each category is construed as complex symbols, or features, with internal structures. The above structures are uniquely characterized by the features. For example, the head in the complements(ion structure should have subeat feature one of whose value is unitied with the complement, C. Furthermore, we assume the following grammartical principles, which are applied to every structures:","Head Feature Principle: same as in III)SG. We assume that pos, dep, and other several features are head features.","Subcat Feature Principle: In the complementation structure shcema (2b), the value of subeat of the mother category unifies with that obtained by subtracting the left daughter category from the value of subcat of the head category. In the other strucrues, the value of subcat of the mother category unifies with that one of the head category.","Binding Feature Principle: The value of a bin(l-ing fcaturc of the nlother category unifies with the ration of its value of the left daughter category and its value of the head category minus the category bound of this local branching t. We assume that slash anti some other features are binding features. Slash feature aud Binding Feature Principle play a crucial role in describing so-called long distance dependency phenomena. We will discuss them in detail in the following sections. 3 Relative Clauses in Japanese Traditionally the relative clause in Japanese has been considered as a kind of so-called ren-1ai syusyoku setu 'the clause for modifying noun'. Because it is charaeterized as an embedded sentence for modifying the head noun in the structure [s ...]N, it can be considered ~.s an adjunct to the head noun. In this paper, we adopt this idea. Thus, the structure of relative clause-head noun construction can be described as shown in Figure 1, where the left daughter category is a relative clause, and the right daughter category is a head noun. The fact that the left daughter category has dep feature whose value","l For example, when the left daughter and the head daughter have { A } and { B } as their slash feature value respectively, the value of slash of the mother will he { A, B } in most cases. llowever, in cane that A can be unifiable with B, the result can be { A ). Furthermore, in case that A (or B I is bound in the local brnaaching stnmture (as in Figure 4), the result will be { n}(o~{A }). [ core tl ] where II = {pos n} Figure 1: Relative Clause as Adjunct"]},{"title":"i1]","paragraphs":["is unifial)le with the right daughter category, characterizes the left daughter (is. relative clause) as all adjunct. tlowever, we have to explain where this dep feature comes from. In Japanse, a relative clause ha.~ a tense form at its end. Thus we assume that tense form is categorized as a verb which takes a verb category as its coinplement, l\"urthermore, we assume that for every tense form (e.g. -ta and -ru), tbere are two different lexieal entries With the same phouetic form, which we call the preaomiual tense form and the assertive tense form 2. Tile former type is assumed to be the ending form of relative clauses, and has a non-mall value in dep feature. This value is bound with the head noun of the relative clause a 4 Types of Relative Clauses Relative clauses can be classilled into the following three types in terms of their structural characteristics (where ¢ marks a gap):","1. SS: Simple Sentence The relative clanse consists of a simple sentence, and the gap plays a role in that sentence, e.g. (3) [ Naomi-ga 5 yore -da] hon","NOM ACC read PAST book","'tile book which Naomi read'","2. ES: Embedded Sentence The relative clause includes an embedded sentence in which the gap plays a role, e.g. (4) [Naomi-ga [Taro-ga ¢ yom-da]","NOM NOM ACC read PAST","-to sinzitei -ru ] hou","CMPL believe PRES book","'the book which Naomi believes Taro read'","3. RC: Relative Clause The relative clause inchnles a relative chmse in which the gap plays a role, e.g. (5) [[¢ ¢ kak -ta]l ..... ga","NOM ACC write PAST book NOM","yoku ure 4a] sakka","well sell I'AST writer","'the writer whose book sold well'","2There are several l'ea.qon~ wily we Call /L~StUlle there are two different lexical el(tries for tense with the same phonetic form {91, 3The assertive tense form is assumed to be the ending form of assertive clauses, and has a null value in dep feature.

The grammatical roles other than subject and object can be classified into the following two types depending on the acceptability of relative clauses sbown in Tablel, where, o, ? and * represent our subjects' judgements are acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable, respectively. :","Adjunct 1 : This includes 'locative'(marked by hi, we and de), 'goal'(marked by ni and he) and 'source'(marked by kara).","Adjunct 2 : This includes 'instrumental'(marked by de), 'reason'(marked by kara) and 'comparative'(marked by yori). In order to simplify the formalization, we will regard the marginal cases as acceptable, and the result is shown in Table 2. This simplification, however, may be too permissive, because usually in the RC clauses are acceptable only when tile gap's role is subject. 5 Formalization In this section we will formalize the syntactic structure of the relative clause in Japanese. First we will formalize the SS type relative clause. Then we formalize the distribution of the slash feature. And finally, we examine the other eases, that is, those in which the gap is derived in either an embedded sentence or a relative clause. 5.1 Simple Relative Clause As discussed in section 3, a relative clause is regarded as an adjunct. Thus, the gap should be bound with tile dep feature value of the prenominal tense category. As shown in the last section, gaps are not restricted to subjects or objects. Optional Adjunct 1 categories ('locative','goal' and 'source') can be a gap. Thus, for simplicity, we here assume that Adjunct 1 type roles are also designated in the value of subcat feature, core subcat }"]},{"title":"dov {hi I:X} [ /' .... }l","paragraphs":["core subcat { [core el} dep {n[ ]:X}","whereC= { pos v } subeat {VII:X} oY Figure 2: Binding of Dep with Subcat Furthermore, we assume that a gap is directly bound with dop feature, instead of being bomtd with an element of slash which is ill turn bound with dep. We call t~his hypothesis the Direct Binding Hypothesis (that is, subcat element can be directly bound with dep). We will discuss tile correctness of this assumption in section 6. This relationship is expressed ill tile lexical entry for pronominal tense category, eg. ~ta, -ru, and -i. The structure is shown ill Figure 2, where tile head daughter is a pronominal tense category. For exampie, kak 'write' is assumed to take bottt subject and object complements and have the following lexical entry as follows: (6) v[eore {subcat {p[gr subj]:X, p[gr obj]:Y}}] Then, a relative clause kak-ta 'wrote' corresponds to the following categories:","(7) a. v[eore {subcat { }, dep { n[g .... bjl }}] b. v[eore {subcat { }, dep { n[gr obj] }}] Thus for kak.ta X (where X is a noun), there are at least two possibilities in the interpretation of the role of X, that is, either subject or object. 5.2 Distribution of Slash As sentence (5) shows, there is a so-called long-distance dependency phenomenon in Japanese. Tiffs phenomenon is described by using the slash feature as in tlPSG. We will characterize the distribution of slash in tile following three sections. 5.2.1 SLASII INTRODUCTION Lexical entries with non-null value in slash feature are introduced by tile following lexical rnle: 4","Subeat-Slash Lexical Rule: [subcat { p[]:X } US]"]},{"title":"[subeat S, slash { n[l:X }]","paragraphs":["Tbe number of slash elements introduced by this rule can be at most onc, a fact which we explaiu more precisely in the next section. 4There are some re~trlctions on the application of tiffs rule. For exmnple, an agghttinated complement emmet become a slash value. ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aour 1992 I 1 0 2 PROC.

In the RC type relative clause, the gap is inherited from the innermost embedded clause to the outermost relative clause shown in Figure :L v[slash X] p[slash X] v[subcat {p[ ]}] n[slash X] p[subcat {n[ ]}","{n[]} ] / NOM sell well holt book Figure 3: Exanrple of Slash Inheritance 5.2.3 SLASH BINDING A long-distance inherited gap can be bound with tile dep of tile prenominal tense category, and finally bound with the head nmm of the relative clause as shown in Figure 4 (where only core features of the mother and the head are shown). For example, if the left daughter category corresponds to kak-ta hou-ga yoku ure 'hook which ¢ wrote sells well'), anti the right daughter (i.e. the bead) to the prcnomiaal tense form -to, then the mother, kak-ta hon-ga yoku ure-ta, will he described as follows:","v[core {dep {n[] }}] It should be noted that we do not necessarily need a specific phrase structure rule for the slash binding with tile dep [9], though it may be uatural that we assume to have such a phrase structure rule as shown in Figure 4. 5.3 Complex Relative Clause In both ES and RC type relative clauses, the Binding Feature Principle specifies that a slash element which is introduced by the Subcat-Slash Lexical Rule is iuherited and finally bound with the dep value of the prenominal tense category in the ontermost relative clause. Figure 5 shows an example of such a structure."]},{"title":"[.os ]","paragraphs":["subeat } dep { X }","slash { X } subcat [core C] dep { X } Figure 4: Slasil Binding n[]"]},{"title":"v[ .... {aep {x}}] nil","paragraphs":["v[slash {X}] v[ .... { dep {X} }] hito kak-ta hon-ga yoku ure -ta where X = n[] Figure 5: Complex l~lative Clause 6 Constraints oil tile Number of Slash","Elenaents As the consequence of tile constraints on slash shown above, an Adjunct 2 type role cannot construct ally acceptable rclatlvization, because it cannot introduce all clement of subcat ill ally lexical entries. As discussed ill section 3, we assume tile relative clause of Japanese language is an adjunct, Thus ill the relativc clause, tile value of tile dep feature is bound with the gap. And according to tile Direct Binding Hypothesis which we proposed ill section 5, a subcat element call he directly bound with the dep. Ilere, we will discuss why this hypothesis is correct. Furthermore, we will show that if we adopt the Direct Binding Hypothesis, the number of slash elements can be at most one. If we don't accept this hypothesis, the only alternative is to assume that the gap is bound only with an element of slash. That is, if an element of subcat cannot be bound directly with the value of the dell the gap should he initially ill the value of slash, and should then be bound with the elenlent of dep. We will call this hypothesis the Indirect B~nding Hypothesis (that is, subcat elenmnt can be indirectly bound with the dep through a lexical rule). First consider the following seutence:","(9) [[ kak -ta] I ........ yuppan-si ota] write PAST book ACC publish PAST syuppansya-ga yuumei-ni nar publisher NOM famous GOAL become -ta ] gakusya PAST scholar 'the scholar such that the publisher that published his book became famous' AC1V.S DECOLING-92, NANTES, 23~28 Aot)r 1992 1 1 0 3 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 This is acceptable to everyone. If we accept the In-direel Binding Hypothesis, the number of slash elements would be at least two, because in the above, every relative clause other than outermost one has at least two slash elements. However, consider the following strnctures (wbere i and j are either 1 or 2, and ¢1 and ¢2 are assumed to be bound with NI and N2, respectively):","(10) a.

Embedded Sentence in Relative Clause [s [s... ¢ .... [s, .,¢~ ... ]-t .... ]N .... ]N~ The following are example sentences with the above structures:","(ll) a.

Taking Indirect Binding Hypothesis, the number of slash elements for the above is 3, 3, and 2, respectively. It follows that in terms of tbe number of slash elements, we cannot explain the difference of the acceptability of the above structures. Ilowever, we accept the Direct Binding Hypothesis, sentence (9) needs only one slash element, and sentences (11) all need at least two. Thus the Direct Binding Hypothesis is better than the Indirect Binding Hypothesis. And adopting this hypothesis leads to the concusion that the number of slash elements should be at most one."]},{"title":"7 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We have described a grammatical formalization of the relative clause in Japanese.
