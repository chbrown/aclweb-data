At present, we have already collected about 50,000 translation exam-pies from a machine readable Japanese-English dictionary (Kodansha Japanese-English Dictionary [10]) and an English learners' textbook.

Once a large amount of this kind of data is collected, statistical data ahout case frames of verbs eaal he extracted, making use of a thesaurus of nominM concepts 7. In the remainder of this section, we will illustrate a general procedure for acquiring case frames of verbs. Lct us start with a collection of a large amount of unified feature descriptions like above for a specific Japanesc verb V~. Suppose that we want to get possible case frames of this verb. By a case frame, we mean something tikc a feature description for this verb, consisting of surface cases each of which is marked hy a postpositional particlc p~ and some specific semantic categories taken from a thesaurus like BGI[. Usually, a verh has several distinct case frames. However, it is not easy to extract those case frames automatically only from the collected unified feature descriptions. So the system finds critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verh using some heuristics, then it asks tile human instructor whether the distinctions of ease frames arc correct. These heuristics and human interactions arc smmnarized as follows.","7At present, ~m oiL-line thesaurus called 'Bunrui Goi Hyou'(BGH)[8] is available for Japanese.

OF COLING-92, NAN'I'ES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 Heuristics 1. Semantic Categor'y in a Thesaurus First, collect the nouns marked by pj in a feature description of the verb Vj from the set of unified feature descriptions. Then mark each collected noun in the thesaurus. If the most specific common layer of the marked nouns is low enough, then we assume that the case marked by pj takes a noun of the semantic category that corresponds to that layer. But if the most specific common layer is higher than a predetermined layer s, the information provided by that layer is too general for tile semantic categories of the case marked by pj. For instance, it is quite rare that both an animate concept and an abstract concept can be the subject of a certain verb. Such a case strongly suggests that the verb has at least two distinct conceptual meanings or two distinct case frames. It then becomes necessary to classify the marked nouns in the thesaurus.","2. Bilingual Intersection of Concepts Some of the heuristics come from the advantages of bilingual intersection of concepts, which we have already shows in Chapter 1 as semantic disambiguation. For a Japanese verb Vj and its case marked by a postpositional particle p j, suppose that unified feature descriptions such as [ pred:(VEl,Vj) , (IEI,pj):{NE1,NJI) ] and [ pred:(VE2 , Vj), (IE2,pJ):(NE2,NJ2) ] are ohtained. Both of these two feature descriptions have a feature label pj for Vj. llowever, if VE1 and V~2 are different verbs or IEl and IE2 are different feature labels, these two feature descriptions may be classified into different case frames of the verb Vj.","3. Correlation of Cases Another heuristics are related to sentence patterns of verbs. Sometimes the ease marked by pj has a correlation with other eases in sentence patterns. If the correlations between cases are detected, then it helps tile classification, and some sentence patterns (or c0.se frames) of the verb Vj will be aeqnired. Human Interactions As described above, the system can find critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verb by those heuristics. The system, however, cannot determine the distinction only with positive data collected from examples. The main purpose of human interaction is to obtain negative examples. The system asks the human instructor whether a case marked by p J1 and another case marked by P J2 call co-occur or not.

It is often said that hand-made semantic dictionary contains quite unstable data, which means that it strongly depends on the human composer. In order to acquire stable lexicat knowledge base, we decided to limit hmnan interactions to yes-no type of questions and answers, such that the system asks the human instructor whether something is true or false so that he can answer only yes or no. 4.2 Examples and Evaluations Wc have collected about 50,000 translation exam-pies from a machine readable dal)anese-English dictionary and an English learners' textbook.

The questions and answers are as follows. QUESTION 1 : C'a, I say ,,..'t Y (pen) -r. (with) l~.~,l~ (English) \"C (in) ~ < {write)\" ?","....... YES. QUESTION 2 : Cat, I say \"2 -- I-\" U.a,'d) ~5 (o,,) 5t [I,,the,') ~5 (t,,) ~ < (,mr, O''","..... NO. The postpositional particle \"~:\" is used to mark two different cases of the verb \"~ < (write)\" in Japm~ese sentences. One of them represents things on which smnething is written like in \"wrile something on , sh~:et of paper\", and the other reI)resents someone to whom a correspondence is written, like ill \"wtalc a letter to a lover\". The difference of these two usages is clear by tit(: bilingual feature label pairs (on, ~= ) and (to, {~ ). 'File human instructor answers that only these two ease slots cannot co-occur. Then two case frames are obtained as in Table 3. This simple experiment suggests that it is quite possible to acquire case frames of verbs from bilingual corpora if enough translation examples are available. Actually, on tim assumption that 200 translation examples arc necessary for acquiring case framcs of onc verb, 100,000 translation examples are necessary for 70 verbs. If a bilingual corpus of 1,000,000 translation examples is obtained, it is possible to compile a semantic dictionary with the same scale as IPAI, through a little interaction with a human instructor for each verb. Wc think it possible to construct a bilingual corl)us of that scale or more in the near fitlure,"]},{"title":"5 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We haw~ proposed a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples of bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring case frames of verbs. At present, we are extending our prototype system for acquiring case frames of verbs, attd the detail of the extended system will be reported in the future. We believe that the I)roposed method is applicable to sew:ral otller problenrs as well. One of them is to acquire features of nominal concepts. We are at the moment looking at some specitie nominal expression \"A q) B\" in Japanese, corresponding literally to \"I1 of A\" in English. That expression specifies a variety of relationships of noun phrases, which are often stated in different expressions in English. They will help to acquire typical attributes of nominal concepts fl'om bilingual corpora. Our ntethod is also useful to collect parsed traamlation examples tbr example-based translation [9] attd to acquire translation patterns between two languages."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[l] [h'cnt, M.: \"Automatic Acquisition of Subcategorization Frames from Untagged Text\", f>roc, of the 29th Anuual Meeti.9 of the AUL, 1991.","[2] l)ag;~n, I., ltai, A. and Schwall, IJ.: \"Two l,an-guages are More hlformative Than One\", Proc. o] the '29th Annual Meetin9 af the ACL, 1991.","[3] ltindle, 1).: \"Noun Classification from Predicate Argument Structures ~, Proc. o.[ the 28th Annual Meeting of the ACL, 1990.","[4] Information-tedmology Promotiml Agency, Japan: IPA Lexicon of the Japane,~e Language for computc,-s IPAL (Basic Vt:rbs),(i, Japanese), 1987.","[5] Japan Electric l)ictionary Research Institute, Ltd.: Com:vptual Dictionary, 2rid.
