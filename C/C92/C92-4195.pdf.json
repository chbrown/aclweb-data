The system needs for each word of its reference vocabulary two types of reference patterns: • prototypal acoustic reference patterns. • phonetic transcriptions of the main pro-","nunciation variants of the word. Up to now the transcriptions were generated for each orthographic word of the reference vocabulary by an automatic procedure having two drawbacks which caused a high amount of manual revision for the generated transcriptions:","• For each\" word only one transcription was generated. Our speech recognition system, however, needs at least the most significant pronunciation variants of each word.","• The automatic procedure took into account only the letter context of each letter to determine its transcription, in German, however, the transcription of a letter is very often also dependent on its morphological context.- Most of the transcription errors of the former system were a consequence of the fact that the system did not have any intbrmation about tile morph structure of the words. To reduce the manual work necessary to revise the transcriptions we currently develop a system with the following new features:","1. An orthographic word is first segmented into its morphs.","2. In a second step one or more phonetic transcriptions are produced for each segmentation of the word using letter-to-phone rules which can refer to the morph structure detected in the first step. The following paragraphs will deal with the first step. We will mainly restrict ourselves to the linguistic knowledge incorporated in our current morph segmentation system. The overall architecture of the segmentation system and details of the segmentation algorithm are described in Wothke/Schmidt (1991). A morphological segmentation procedure for German has to deal with the following basic features of German morphology:","• Composition.","• Derivation.","• lnflexion.","• Ambiguous morph structure: Some words can be segmented in several ways.","• Reduction of consonant triples: If two lexical morphs are concatenated, where the first morph ends in a vocalic letter and two identical consonantal letters and the second morph starts with the same consonantal letter and a vocalic letter, then the result of the concatenation does not contain the consonantal letter three times but only twice. - The inverse process, i.e. trebling of double consonants, has to be carried out, when segmenting such words. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the morphological segmentation system. The interpreter for the segmentation has 5 main input files: Ac'I~ DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt'/T 1992 1 2 1 8 PROC.

We developed a classification scheme lbr German morphs and a suitable word syntax. The signiticant step to our current version was the classification of an extensive German morph list based on about 9,(100 nlorphs compiled by the Institut fi~r deutsche Sprachc m Mannheim (Germany). We merged thesc morphs with an expcrimcntal list of about 2,200 morphs which we used in tile former versions of our system. Additionally, we in-creased the resulting list up to ahnost I1,000 entries by many loreign morphs. It turned out that for the manual development of the syntax the tormalism o(\" finite state networks is easier to handle than a right linear regular grammar. So we lirst represented the syntax with a finite statc network, which finally was translated into a tuoctionally equivalent right linear grammar.

So far, we have developed and tested successively four classification schemes, each with a new, better syntax. We describe the third and fourth scheme, which are of actual interest (cf. table 1). The substructures of the entire transition net dealing with the word classes verb, adjective, noun etc. will be called verb net, adjective net, noun net etc. We should stress that these substructures are not independent automata with any separate input. Nevertheless we call them nets; parts of these nets will be called subnets.- Although the word formation of the different word classes is not fully distinct and does share some substructures, it was not possible to design the entire net in such a way that the nets for these word classes physically share some subnets. Instead physical copies of common subnets had to be created for each occurrence of such a subnet in each of the nets. This is since we used a finite state net-work for the representation of the word syntax. This formalism does not allow to activate from different points one common subnet and afterwards to return to the appropriate activation point. We will limit the following description to the nets for those word classes with productivity in word formation. Verbs Our Verb Net is responsible for the segmentation of finite verbs. Those of its subnets containing stem-labelled arcs refer to different combinations of mood, tense, and weakness vs strongness of the verb stem. Each of these combinations demands specific inflexional endings. - Weak stems are tense-invariant, strong stems can vary - according to tense - by vowel gradation (Umlaut or Ablaut). As a consequence, the classification of strong verb stems is oriented towards their suitability for certain tenses. For example, < = ging> is an imperfect tense form of < = geh%en> (engl. to go). In our morph dictionary the two morphs <geh> and <ging> are two independent entries, each with its own tense-oriented classification. Weak stems are classified according to prefixation and derivation needs. We took into account three groups Overview of the Extent of the Syntaxes and Classification Systems Developed ofderivational suffixes: 1) <-el>, <-er>, 2) < -ig>, < -lich >, and 3) < ~ier>. In the area of verb prefixes, one problem solved in our current version was to avoid the splitting of particular prefixes, e.g. * < + her+ unter- =geh%en> apart of the correct segmentation which is < + herunter = geh%en > (engl.: to go down). In German, each infinitive can take the role of a noun, and each participle can do the same after being inflected. As a consequence, the part of our transition net related to infinite verbs is integrated into the Noun Net. The set of verb stem classes had to be expanded for our current version to implement composition restrictions concerning verb stems as parts of nouns. For example, we had to cope with missegmentations such as • < + Er= find + er = sehon%ung> apart of the correct segmentation < + Er= find%er- =schon%ung> (engl. careful treatment of inventors). At least two restrictions exist: Firstly, the verb stem < find> is not allowed before a noun (which the word • < Erschonung> would be, if existing) but, e.g., the originally identically classified verb stem <bind> is, as in < Bindladen> (engl. string). Secondly, the morph <er> is no suitable prefix for the verb stem <schon> but, e.g., for the originally identically classified verb stem < schein >, leading to <erscheinen> (engl. to appear). Verb-stem-related restrictions like these, which we imple-mented in our system by adding morph classifications to the existing ones, are only relevant for nouns, in the first case mentioned above, this is obvious. The second restriction does not concern finite verbs, because missegmentations only occur when the morph < er> is positioned between two stems. At the be-ginning of a word, the morph <er> can be seen as a prefix without any restrictions. Adl'ectives The adjective net consists of three subnets, each representing a possible way of adjectival derivation in German.","I. Simple adjectives like < schnell> (engl.: last), <schOn> (engl.: beautiful) etc. AcrEs DE COLING-92. NAN'rF_S, 23-28 AOl'rr 1992 l 2 2 0 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 These stems can be compared and inflected. Some stems occur only in a certain degree o[ comparison like <bess> (stem of engl.: better), < bcs> (stem ofengl.: best). They have obligatory comparative or superlative sufiixes while the corresponding stems of the positive degree must not be followed by tllese suffixes, like e.g. <gut> (engl.: good).","2. Adjectives derived from verbs or verbal stems like < +be=gch%bar> (engl.: passable)","3. Adjectives derived from nonns. Example: < = held%en%haft> (engl.: heroic). As a peculiarity o1\" German word formation, a past participle may be compared and intlected like an adjective stem. l!xampte: The past participle of <gclingcn> (engl.: to succeed) has the comparative forms < +ge- = lung%en >, < + ge = lung%en%er >, < (am) + ge = lung%en%st%en >. These may be translated as \"successful, more successful, most successful'. Roughly speaking, the concept of the adjective net is to allow an adjective stem to be substituted by more complex constructions, like the ones described above. Special subnets are existing for adverbs and tot adjectives with non-German stems. The latter is needed for marking foreign suffixes like in < =parall_el> because these suffixes attract the word accent, which in (ierman causes a vowel to be pronounced long. Nouns A very productive feature of German word formation in thc arca of nouns is composition: New nouns may be fbrmed by concatenation of lexical morphs, optionally interspersed with prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. In our noun net, this feature is modelled by loops over lexical morphs which can be left by inflexion modules to reach a final state and which cross infix modules (including zero-infix), prefix modules, and (derivational) suffix modules. lnflexional suffixes occurring in compound nouns between lexical morphs are treated by us the same way as infixes. Noun stems are classilied according to the features umlaut, etymology (German vs not German), obligatory affix, inIlexional suflix, and composition needs. Foreign Words Each of the described nets contains subnets dealing with the l~brmation of foreign words which are involved in German word formation, e.g. < = mum.if iz%ier%en> (engl. to mumify), < = Bas is > (engl. basis), < = l'ort~ier (Frenctii engl. porter). Foreign words without connection to German word tbrmation and names are not intended to be segmented by our system. So an unsegmented word is not necessarily a system failure but can be a required rejection (el. Table 3)."]},{"title":"3 EVALUATION","paragraphs":["The experimental morph list used during the development of versions 1, 2, and 3 of\" our syntax and classilication scheme consisted of 2,200 morphs mainly selected from Ortmann (1985). In the fourth system the morph list was extended to ahnost 11,00(1 morphs (cf Table 1). To evaluate the different versions (each consisting of syntax and classification scheme), two word sets were used each conraining 3,0(10 words. The first set consisted of rank 1 - 1,000, 300,(X) 1 - 301,000, and 600,001-601,000 of a ti'equency list sorted in descending order which was created fi~om a corpus containing articles of a German business newspaper with about 31,000,(X)0 running words. This set was used for the iterative improvement of\" our system. 1t is called test set. The second set, serving as a control set, con~ rained rank 1,001-2,000, 200,001-201,000, and 400,001-401,000 of a corpus obtained from a common newspaper with about 13,200,000 running words. The control set was necessary because of the risk that the later versions were designed in such a way as to cope only with those errors which arose when applying the earlier versions to tire test set. Table 2 shows the improvement in coverage inainly achieved by extending the morph list: While - refcrriug to the control set only - the third system segmented only !/125 of the input words (=47.5%), the lourth system segmented 2,492 words (= 83%). The quality of the segmentations of the tburth system is a little worse. The reason for this effect is the larger morph list allowing more nonsense concatenations of morphs. Although we made grammar and classification system more restrictive, it would have been too costly to strive for equal or better segmentation quality. Table 3 gives an overview of the words which were not segmented by the fourth system. Many of them are proper names. Acll~.s DE COL1NG-92, NArCrEs, 23-28 AO~r 1992 l 2 2 1 PROC.
