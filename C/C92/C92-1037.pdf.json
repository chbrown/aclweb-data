This treatment avoids the use of non-standard logics, and avoids the need for systematic ambiguity of verb semantics."]},{"title":"1 Background","paragraphs":["Previous work on the semantics of bare plural NPs has largely focussed on the contribution they make in habitual sentences like (1) Mar~ eaiJ peaches. and (2) John likes driving fast cars. Both (1) and (2) seem to express tendencies, general rules. If you heard (1) then you would feel confident that you could offer Mary a peach for dessert. (1) seems to express a general characteristic of Mary, namely that if you offer her a peach in a suitable situation she will eat it. If you heard (2) then you would hide the keys of your Ferrari when John was visiting. (2) tells you that if he gets the chance of driving a fast car he is likely to take it. If we take (1) and (2) as paradigms of the way bare plural NPs get used then it is reasonable to suppose that they express some hind of general property. The NP peaches in (1), for instance, seems to express some relationship between Mary and peaches in general, or possibly between Mary and the property of being a peach. This feeling that bare plural NPs express general relationships has led to some rather desperate strategies. One is to suppose that they should be treated just as though they were universally quantified. The most cursory examination, however, shows that this cannot be right. It simply is not true that (1) entails that Mary has any relationship to the set of all peaches. It is not even true that it entails that she will always eat a peach if you offer her one in the right circumstances. Whatever bare plural NPs do, they do not act like universally quantified NPs. A more sophisticated approach treats them as denoting properties. Chierchia and Turner [1987], for instance, interpret (1) as saying that Mary is in some relationship to the property of being a peach. There are two problems with this approach. The first is that they fail to be very explicit about what this relationship is, so that the proposal simply does not get us very far. The second is that whatever the relationship turns out to be we seem to end up with a systematic ambiguity in the meanings of simple verbs like eat. In (3) Mary is eating a peach. it looks as though the verb eat denotes u relation between two individuals, namely Mary and some peach. In (1), however, it must denote a relationship between an individual (Mary) and a property (the property of being a peach). Eat, it seems, is polymorphic. And so must every other verb which can take either an indefinite NP or a bare plural as complement be. Farthermore, there must be some systematic relation between the two interpretations of each of these verbs. It would surely be better to express this systematic relation in the semantics of the bare plural NPs, and to leave verbs like eat as relations between individuals. Much the same can be said of Carlson's [1989] proposal that bare plurals denote extended individuals and indefinite NPs denote stages ofindivlduals. If we take this approach then (a) most English verbs must be polymorphic, accepting either extended individuais or stages of individuals as arguments, and (b) there must be some systematic relationship between these pairs of meanings. It is particularly disappointing that Carlson's discussion of this systematic relationship consists of the use of a type-raising operator Gn which is given no semantics. A third approach is to try to capture the feeling that bare plurals indicate some sort of \"tendency\" by appealing to non-monotonic logic. Just as with the analysis in terms of universals, however, this just seems to get the intuitions wrong. What sort of non-monotonic paraphrase can we give to (1)?

OF COLING-92, NAICrEs, Au(i. 23-28, 1992 does not mean that Mary eats most peaches~ in the sense that there is some relationship between Mary and more than half the peaches there either are now or ever have been. It does not mean that it is frequently, or even usually, the case that she can be found eating a peach (it is true, for instance, that I eat quails eggs, but it is certainly not true that it happens very often). The gut feeling that sentences llke (1) and (2) express general tendencies, and that the best machinery we have for dealing with tendencies is non-monotonic logic, is very understandable. It does not, however, seem easy to give convincing formal paraphrases of sentences like these in these terms. The problems with these suggestions arise from the fact (1) and (2) seem to express general tendencies, and that this is taken to be due the presence of the bare plurals NPs. Suppose we consider instead the occurrence of bare plural NPs in non-habitual sentences: (4) Marl/ is eaZingpeaches. (5) John is driving fast cars. (4) does not express any sort of tendency, any general rule. It describes a specific current event. There is an individual, Mary, who is doing something. What is she doing? She's eating. What is she eating? She is eating several things, each of which is a peach. (5) does not even seem to make much sense. Why not? Because it seems to describe a specific driving event with a single agent but with several objects, each of which is a fast car. (5) seems odd because it seems to say that John is driving several fast cars at the same time, and we know that most people can only drive one ear at a time. We therefore suggest that the feeling that (1) and (2) express tendencies arises entirely from the form of the verb, and that bate plurals should be thought of as delimiting the arguments of the verb. In other words, we sugest that (4) should be thought of in much the same way as (6) Ma~ is house-hunting. which says what Mary is doing is hunting for something, and that what she is looking for is a house."]},{"title":"2 Semantic Framework","paragraphs":["The treatment of bare plurals proposed in this paper ntJ within the following general framework. • Verbs denote events (subdivided into states, extended actions and instantaneous actions). • There is a finite set of thematic roles, such as agent, instrument, target and object. The syntactic sub-categorisation rules of individual verbs allocate sets of items to these roles. These sets often turn out to be singletons, but it seems better to distinguish between singular and plural NPs in terms of the cardinality of some tee of objects than to say that singular NPs denote individuals and plurals denote sets. • Tense and aspect express relations between events or sets of events and temporal objects such as instants and intervals. • Definite reference and anaphora are treated as PRESUPPOSITION-INDUCING mechanisms. Presuppositions are described in terms of formulae each of which is required to pick out exactly one item in the context of an utterance. The semantics of any natural language expression consists of a set of such presuppositions and a matrix, which corresponds to the usual notion of propositional content. The dements of this framework ate not universally accepted, but they do at least all have respectable ancestors. The most contentious is the view that definite reference and anaphora should be dealt with in terms of constraints on the situation of utterance. The basic notion here is similar to the use of ANCHORS in situation semantics [Barwise & Perry 1983], and to the treatment ofanaphora in DRT [Kamp 1984]. The details of our approach are given in [Ramsay 1990a]. Very little in the present discussion of bare plurals depends on this treatment of definite reference. Sceptics about this part of our framework are invited to suspend their disbelief while considering the treatment of bare plurals. The following analysis of (7) John a~e a peach. should illustrate the crucial aspects of our representation:","[.~tri~ :3A 3B VC mer.~r(C, B) -4 ~h(C) ̂IBI = 1","A VD member(D, A) eat(D) A agent(D, E)"]},{"title":"̂objed(D, B) m IAI","paragraphs":["="]},{"title":"1 A","paragraphs":["VF"]},{"title":"member(F, A)","paragraphs":["--~ eztended( F)","A 3G instant(G)","A G < now","A at(G, F), Acrv.s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 2 2 8 PROC.

How do we deal with their use in habituM sentences like (1)? We take it that (1) somehow expresses a general tendency, qb say Mar T eats peaches is to say that on suitable occasions she can be found eating peaches. The word %uitable n carries a lot weight here• If you say Mary cain Beluga caviar, you probably mean that she eats it whenever she can get it. If you say Mary eats sausages you are more likely to mean that she he~ quently eats thent, probably because she's too poor to afford caviar very often. Indeed, the ehameteri~tttion of Usuitable\" is likely to change from situation to situation eveu for the same sentence. You could say She eats sausages lit response to the question Is Mart a funny eater?, iu which ease Usuitable\" might mean something like \"if she's offered them and there's no other choice\". You could also say it in response to tile question Does Mary ]tare a health v varied diet ¢. Here, %uitable\" would be more likely to memt Son nearly every occasion when site eats anything at all\". We suggest that the best way to dam with this h to treat habituals as simply saying that events of the kind iu question exist. The significance oftmying that such events exist will depend on the situation in which it is said. Suppose you say that events in which Mary eats sausages exist in a situation where your hearer wants to know about the existence of events where she eats things that some people might not like (i.e. in response to Is Mary a fussy eater~.), in such a case the fact that there are such events is enough to satisfy the heater's curiosity, and there are therefore no grounds for them to assume anything about how often site eats them. Suppose, on the other hand, that you respond to a question about the variety of her diet by simply saying that there are occasions when she eats sausages. Your hearer is then likely to assume that you are implicating that these are MI or most of the \"Mary eating something\" events that you know about, since if you knew about other things Mary ate then you would know that her diet was reasonably varied, lit other words, hnbituaLs simply posit the existence of sonic set of events of the specified kind.

This enables us to avoid postulating a systematic polymorphism for verb semantics t with one interpretation in terms of individuals for cases where some argument is supplied by a singular NP and another in terms of sets of individuals for cases where the same argument is supplied by a plural NP; and (iii) we used an event-oriented treatment of verb semantics (see for instance Davidson [1980]). It is worth noting that Krit~ [19901 and Pulman [1991] have also developed treatments of complex quantificstional phenomena on the basis of this kind of treatment of verbs.
