The lexicon is available in two formats. The first can be used by an implementation of a two-level processor for morphological analysis (Karttunen and Wittenhurg, 1983; Antworth, 1990). The second, derived from the first one for efficiency reasons, consists of a disk-based database using a UNIX hash table facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). We also built an X Window tool to facilitate the maintenance and browsing of the lexicon. The package is ready to be integrated into an natural language application such as a parser through hooks written in Lisp and C. To our knowledge, this package is the only available free English morphological analyzer with very wide coverage. attributes. To improve performance, we used PC-KIMMO as a generator on our lexicons to build a disk-based hashed database with a UNIX database facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). Both formats, PC-KIMMO and database, are now available for distribution. We also provide an X Window tool for the database to facilitate maintenance and access. Each format contains the morphological information for over 317000 English words. The morphological database for English runs under UNIX; PC-KIMMO runs under UNIX and on a PC. This package can be easily embedded into a natural language parser; hooks for accessing the morphological database from a parser are provided for both Lucid Common Lisp and C. This morphological database is currently being used in a graphical workbench (XTAG) for the development of tree-adjoining grammars and their parsers (Paroubek et al., 1992)."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Morphological analysis has experienced great success since the introduction of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983; Karttunen, 1983). Two-level morphology and its implementation are now well under-stood both linguistically and eomputationany (Karttunen, 1983; Karttunen and Wittenburg, 1983; Koskenniemi, 1985; Barton et al., 1987; Koskenniemi and Church, 1988). This computational model has proved to be well suited for many languages. Although there are some proprietary wide coverage morphological an-alyzers for English, to our knowledge those that are freely available provide only very small coverage. Working from the 1979 edition of the Collins Dictionary of the English Language available through ACL-DCI (Liberman, 1989), we constructed lexicons for PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990), a public domain implementation of a two-level processor. Using the morphological rules for English inflections provided by Karttunen and Wittenburg (1983) and our lexicons, PC-KIMMO outputs all possible analyses of each in-put word, giving its root form and its inflectional *This work was partially supported by DARPA Grant N0014-90-31863, ARO Grant DAAL03-89-C-0031, and NSF Grant IPd90-16592.

The rules handle the following phenomena (among others1): epenthesis, y to i correspondences, s-deletion, elision, i to y correspondences, gemination, and hyphenation. In addition to the set of rules, PC-KIMMO requires lexicons. We derived PC-KIMMO-style lexicons from the 1979 edition of the Collins Dictionary of the English Language. The 90000-odd roots ~ in the lexicon yield over 317000 inflected forms. The lexicons use the following parts of speech: verbs (V), pronoun (Pron), preposition (Prep), noun (N), de-terminer (D), conjunction (Conj), adverb (Adv), and adjective (A). Figure 1 shows the distribution of these parts of speech ill the two formats: The first column is the distribution of the root forms in the PC-KIMMO lexicon files, and the second column is tile distribution for the inflected forms derived from the lexicons and stored in the database. For each word, the lexicon lists its lexical form, a continuation class, and a parse. The continuation class specifies which inflections the lexical form can undergo. At most, a noun root engenders four inflections (singular, plural, singular genitive, plural genitive); an adjective root, three (base, comlWe refer the render to Karttunen and Wittenburg (1983) or Antworth (1990) for more details on the morphological rule~. 2Proper nouns were not included in the tables.

For example, the lexicon entry for the adjective 'funky' is: funky A-Root2 \"A (~unky)\" The entry consists of a word ~unky, followed by the continuation class hA~oot2, and a parse \"A(fuaky)\". The continuation class specifies that the word can undergo the normal rules of comparative and superlative, and the parse states that the word is an adjective with root 'funky'. The following is a sample run of PC-KIMMO's recognizer: recognizer>>funky funky A(funky) recognizer>>funkier funky+er A(funky) COMP recognizer>>funkiest funky+est A(funky) SUPER The output line contains the root tbrm and any affixes, separated by '+'s. Thus, a '+' in the output indicates a morphological rule was used; its absence means no rule was used, and the parse was returned as found in the lexicon. PC-KIMMO will antomatically add attributes such as COKP and SUPER to the parse, depend-ing on the morphological rule matched by the surface form. But for irregularly inflected forms, special continuation classes indicate that tbc complete parse (viz., part of speech, root, mid attributes) should be taken 'as is' from the lexicon entry. For example: better A-Root I \"l(good) COMP\" beat A..Root; 1 \"A (good) SUPFAt\" good A-Root I \"A(good)\" Tile class A-Root1 tells PC-KIMMO not to apply the morphological rules to 'better', 'best', and 'good'. Thus, 'gooder' is not recognized as 'goodTcr'. recognizeC;~best best N(best) SG best A(good) SUPER best Adv(beet) recognizer>>good good N(good) SG good A(good) recognizer>>better better N(better) SG better A(good) COMP better V(better) INF better Adv(better) recognizer>>gooder *** NONE *** recognizer>>goodest *** NONE ***","The attributes (such as COl,~') can later be translated","into feature structures with the help of templates as in","PATR (Shieber, 1986).

Consequently, our large lexicons occupy more than 19 Mbytes of process memory. Further, the large size of the structure implies long search times as PC-KIMMO swaps pages in and out.

OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 a disk-based database using a UNIX hash table facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). To compile the database, we used PC-K1MMO as a generator, inputting each root form and all the endings that it could take, as indicated by the continuation class. The resulting inflected form became thc key, and the associated morphological information was then in-serted into the database. For example, the PC-KIMMO lexicon file contains the entry: sa,~ if_Root 2 \"II (saw)\" The class LRoot2 indicates that tire noun 'saw' forms its plural, singular genitive, and plural genitive regularly. Thus, we send to the generator three lexieal forms and the three suffixes for each infleetiou, extract-ing three inflected surface forms:","Lexical ea~+s sav+'s sav+s+'s","Surface saws saw ~ s saws J The root form of a noun is identical with the singular iuflection, so we have a total of four inflected forn~s. Since we know which suffix we added to tbe root, we also know the attributes for that inflection. The inflected form becomes the key, while tile part of speech, root, and attributes are stored as the content in tire database. Hence, the lexicon entry for the noun 'saw' produces four key-content pairs in tbe database: Csaw, saw N SG), (saws, saw II PL), (saw's, saw l[ SG GEl[), (saws ~ , saw l[ PL GEN). Likewise, the verb lexicon contains the entries: salt V_Root 8 \"V(saw)\" saw V_Roo~l \"vCsee) PAST STR\" The continuation class VAtoot8 indicates fonr inflections besides the infinitive: third-person singular (+s), past (+ed), weak past participle (Ted), and present participle (+ing). Hence, the generator produces:","Lexical sal~+s saw+ed saw+ing","Surface saws sawed sawing The class V_Rootl allows no irdlections, but builds tire inflection-feature pair directly: (sav, sea V PAST STR). Ilence, morphological aualysis is rednced to sending the surface forms to the database as keys arid retriev-ing thc returned strings.

The tables handle approximately 317000 inflected forms corresponding to 90000 steins. These tables can be used by an implementation of a two-level processor for morphological analysis such as PC-KIMMO. However, these large tables degrade the performance of PC-KIMMO's current implementation, requiring about 18 Mbytes of RAM while slowing the access time. To overcome these shortcomings, we created a morphological analyzer consisting of a disk-based database using a UNIX hash table facility. With this database, access times average 6 to 10 milliseconds while moving all of the data to the disk. We also provide an X Window tool for facilitating the maintenance and access to the database. The package is ready to be integrated into an application such as a parser. Hooks written in Lisp and C for accessing these tables are provided.
