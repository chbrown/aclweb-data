(Sannella & Tarleeki 1987) for an overview, and (Newton in prep.) for the apldication to grammar writing). A second motivation, discussed in detail by (Beierle & Pletat 1988; Beierle K~ Pletat 1989; Beierle et al. 1988), is to use equational ADTS to provide a mathematical foundation for h~ature structures. A third motivation, dominant in this pal)er , is to use the AI)T appl'oach lo provide a richer array of explicit data types than are readily admitted by \"p'tlre' feature structure approaches. Briefly, in their raw form, [eature terms (i.e., fnrnlalislns for describing h~alure stru(:tures) do not always provide a perspicuous format for representing strllc-t II re. On the ADT approach, complex data types are built up from atomic types by means of con-structor functions. For example .... (where we use the underscore '_' to mark the position of the fimction's arguments) creates elements of type List. A dala type may also have selector functions for taking data elements apart. Thus, selectors for lhe type L±st are the func tions first and last. Standard feature-bossed encoding of lisls uses only selectors for the data type; i.e. the feature labels FIRST and LAST ill ( 1 ) FIRST : o\" 1 17 LAST : (FIRST : o\" 2 17 LAST : nil) tlowever, the list constructor is left implicit, That is, the feature term encoding tells you how lists are pulled apart, but does not say how they are built up. When we confine our atlention just to lists, lhis is not much to worry about, ltowever, tile situation becomes less satisfactory when we atIelnpI' to encode a larger variety of data structures into one and the same feature term; say, for example, standard lis(s, associatiw~ lists (i.e. strings), constituent structure hierarchy, and au tosegmental association. In order to distinguish axtequately between elements of such data types, we really need to know the logical properties of their respective constructors, and this is awl 1 4 9 PRec. oF COLING-92. NANTES. AUG. 23-28. 1992 ward when the constructors are not made explicit. For computational phonoloKv, it is not an unlikely scenario to be confronted with such a variety of data structures, since one may well wish to study the complex interaction between, say, non-linear teml)oral relations and prosodic hierarchy. As a vehicle for computational implementation, the uniformity of standard attribute/value notation is extremely usefld. As a vehicle for the-ory development, it can be extraordinarily uuperspicuous. The approach which we present here treats phonological concepts as abstract data types. A particularly convenient development environlnent is provided by the language OBJ (Goguen & Winkler 1988), which is based on order sorted equa, tionaJ logic, and all the examples given below (except where explMtly iudicated to the con trary) run in the version of OBJ3 released by sltI in 1988. The denotalional semantics of a.n OB.] module is an algehra, while its operational semantics is based on order sorted rewritiug. I 1 1.1 and 1.2 give a more detailed introduction into the formal framework, while § 2 and 3 ilhlstrate the approach with some phonological examples. 1.1 Abstract Data Types A data type consists of one or more domains of data items, of which certaiu elements are designated as basic, together with a set of opera tious on the domains which suffice to generate al] data items in the domains fl'om the I)asic items. A data type is abstract if it is independenl of any particular ret)resentational scheme. A fundamental claim of the ADJ group (cf. (Goguen. Thatcher ,~ Wagner 1976)) and llluch subsequent work (cf. (Ehrig & MMn\" 1985)) is that abstracl data types are (to be modelled as) algebras: and moreover, that the models of abstract data types are ilfitial alget)ras. ~ The signature ofa mauy-sorted algebra is a l)air","= <S,O } consistiug of a set S of sorts and a se~ O of constant and operation symbols. A specification is a pair (rE> consisting of a signal are together with a set g of equations over terms constructed from symbols in O and variables of the sorts in S. A model for a speciIica.tion is","~An initial algebra is characlerized uniquely up to |so morphism as the semantics of a specification: there is a unique homomorphisnl from the initial algebra inlo t'vely algebra of the specification. an algebra over the signature which satisfies all the equations £. Initial algebras play a special role as the semantics of an algebra. An initial algebra is minimal, in the sense expressed by the principles \"no junk' and 'no confusion'. 'No junk' means that the algebra only contains data which are denoted by variable-fl'ee terms built up from ol)eration symbols in the signature. 'No confusion' means that two such terms t and t ~ denote the same object in the algebra only if the equation t = F is derivable from the equations of the specification. Specifications are written in a convent|ohM format consisting of a declaration of sorts, operation symbols (op), and equations (oq). Preceding the equations we list all the variables (var) which figure in them. As an illustration, we give below an OBJ sl)ecification of the data type LIST1.","(2) obj LIST1 is sorts Ell List op nil : -> List . op .~ : Eli List -> List . op head : List -> Eli . op tail : List -> List . var X : Eli . vat L : List . eq (X . nil) = X . eq head(X , L) = X . eq tail(X .

Together. tiw al'ity and value sort constilute the rank of an operation. The declaration op nil : -> Elt means that nil is aconstant of sorl Ell, The specitication(2) fails to guarantee that there are any objects of El/:. While we could of course add soule constants of this sort, we would like to have a more general solution. In a particular application, we might want to define phonological words as a List of syllables (plus other constraints, of course), and phonological phrases as a List of words, rl'hat is, we need to parameterlze the type LIST1 with respect to the class of elements which constitute the lists. Before turning to parameterization, we will first see how a many-sorted specification language is generalized to an order sorted language by introducing a subsort relation.

Now we can illustrate the flmction of selectors in phonological rules. Consider the case of 1';11glish regular plural formation (-s), where the voicing of the suffix seglnent agrees with that of the immediately preceding segment, unless it is a coronal fricative (in which case there musl be an intervening vowel). Suppose we introduce the variables S1 $2 : Root, where S1 is the stemfinal segment and S2 is the suffix. The rllle nllls[ also be able to access tile coronal node of $1. Making use of the selectors, this is simply $2 !oral !tongue !coronal (a nota.tion reminiscent of paths in feature logic. (Kasper k llonnds 1986)). The rule must test whether this coronal node contains a fi'icative specification. This necessitates an extension to our specification, which is described below. Browman & Goldstein (19S9. 234ff) define \"con striction degree percolation', based on whal they call ~tube geometry'. The vocal trac| can b(, viewed as an interconnected set of tllbes, and the articulators correspond to valves which have a mmlber of settings ranging from fiflly open to fiflly closed. As already mentioned, these ~eltings are called constriction degrees ( ! cds). where fully closed is the maximal constriction and fully open is the minimal constriction. The net constriction degree of the oral cavity may be expressed as the maximum of the constriction degrees of the lips, tongue tip and Iongue body. The net constriction degree of the oral and nasal cavities together is simply the minimmn of the two component constriction degrees. To re cast this in the present framework is straight[or-ward.
