Yet, they have not arrived at the stage where they could be used as pre-procezsors for full-fledged parsing. Accuracy is still not high enough. To improve accuracy, it is necessary to investigate the points where statistical data is being misinterpreted, leading to incorrect results. In this paper we investigate inaccuracy which is injected when a pre-processor relies solely on collocations and blurs the distinction between two separate relations: thematic relations and sentential relations. Thematic relations are word pairs, not necessarily adjacent, (e.g., adjourn a meeting) that encode information at the concept level. Sentential relations, on the other hand, concern adjacent word pairs that form a noun group. E.g., preferred stock is a noun group that must be identified as such at ttle syntactic level. Blurring the difference between these two phenomena contributes to errors in tagging of pairs such as ezpressed concerns, a verb-noun construct, as opposed to preferred stocks, an adjective-noun construct. Although both relations are manifested in the corpus as high mutual-information collocations, they possess difl'erent prot)erties and they need to be separaled. In our method, we distinguish between these two cases by asking additional questions of the corpus. By definition, thematic relations take on filrther variations in the corpus. Expressed concerns (a thematic relation) takes concerns expressed, expressing concerns, express his concerns ere. On the other hand, preferred stock (a sentential relation) does not take any such syntactic variations. We show how this method impacts pre-processing and parsing, and we provide empirical results based on the analysis of an 80-million word corpus.

Such a mechanism would recieve its tokens in the form of words, characters, or morphemes, negotiate all given constraints, and produce a full chart with all possible interpretations. However, when tested on a real corpus, (i.e., Wall Street Journal (WSJ) news stories), this mechanism fares poorly. For one thing, a typical well-behaved 34-word sentence produces hundreds of candidate interpretations. In effect the parsing burden is passed onto a post processor whose task is to select the appropriate parse tree within the entire forest. For another, ill-behaved sentences - roughly one out of three WSJ sentences is problematic - yield no consistent interpretation whatsoever due to parsing failures. To alleviate problems associated with rough edges in real text, a new strategy has emerged, involving text pre-processing. A pre-processor, capitalizing on statistical data [Church el aL, 1989; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Dagan et al., 1991], and customized to the corpus itself, could abstract idiosyncracies, highlight regularities, and, in general, feed digested text into the unification parser.","What is Pre-Processing Up","Against? The Linguistic Phenomenon Consider (Figure 1) a WSJ (August 19, 1987) paragraph processed by NLpc (NL corpus pro~ eessing) [Zernik el aL, 1991J. Two types of linguistic constructs must be resolved by the pre-processor: Class A preferred/AJ stock/NN *comma* and expressed/VB eoneern/NN about How can a program determine that preferred stock is an adjective-noun, while expressed concern is a verb-aoun construct? The Input The scope of the pre-processing task is best illustrated by the input to the prc-processor shown in Figure 2. This lexical analysis of the sentence is based on the Collins on-line dictionary (about 49,000 lexical entries extracted by NLpe) plus morphology. Each word is associated with candidales part of speech, and almost all words are ambiguous. The tagger's task is to resolve the ambiguity. For example, ambiguous words such as services, preferred, and expressed, should be tagged as noun (nn), adjective (aj), and verb (vb), respectively.

Initial Observation: Co-occurrence Entails Sentential Relations The bazic intuition used invariably by all existing statistical taggers is stated as follows: Significant collocations (i.e., high MIS) predict syntactic word association. Since, for example, preferred stock is a significant collocation (mis 9.9), with all other clues assumed neutral, it will be marked as an integral noun group in the sentence. However, is high mis always a good predictor? Figure 3 provides mutual information scores for preferred, expressed, and closed right collocations. The first column (preferred) suggests mis is a perfect predictor. A count in the corpus confirms that a predictor based on collocations is always correct. A small sample of preferred collocations in context is given Figure 4. Notice that in all eases, preferred is an adjective. Next Observation: Co-occurrence Entails Thematic Relations While column 1 (preferred) yields good syntactic associations, column 2 (ezpressed) and column 3 (closed) yield different conclusions. It turns out (see Figure 4) that expressed collocations, even collocations with high mis, produce a bias towards false-positive groupings. 4 If these collocation do not signify word groupings, what do they signify? An observation of expressed right collocates reveals that the words surprise, confidence, skepticism, optimism, disappointment, support, hope, doubt,","4Word associations based on corpus do not dictate the nature of word groupings; they merely provide a predictor that is accounted for with other locaJ-context clues. worry, salisfaclion, etc., are all thematic relations of express. Namely, a pair such as expressed disappointment denotes an action-object relation which could come in many variants. The last part of Figure 4 shows various combinations of express and its collocates. Using Additional Evidence In light of this observation, it is necessary to test in the corpus whether collocations are fixed or variable. For a collocation wordl-word2, if wordl and word2 combine in multiple ways, then wordl-word2 is taken as a thematic relation; otherwise it is taken as a fixed noun group. This test for ezpress~word is shown in Figure 5. Each row provides the number of times each variant is found. Variants for expressed concerns, for example, are concerti expressed, express concern, ezpresses concern, and express. ing concern. Not shown here is the count for split co-occurrence [Smadja, 1991], i.e., express its concern, concern was expressed. The last column sums up the result as a ratio (variability ratio) against the original collocation. In conclusion, for 12 out of 15 of the checked collocations we found a reasonable degree of variability."]},{"title":"Making Statistics Operational","paragraphs":["While the analysis in Figure 5 provides the motivation for using additional evidence, we have two steps to take to make this evidence useful within an operational tagger.

In this paper, we investigated specifically the PastParticiple-Noun category (e.g., preferred-stock, expressed-concerns, etc.). Other categories (in particular ContinuousVerb-Noun as ill driving cars vs. operating systems) are processed in a similar way, using slightly different evidence and thresholds.","The Figures qbtal cases: 2031 Applicable cases: 400 Insufficient data: 23 Incorrect tagging: 19 Correct tagging: 3,58 Evaluation Out of 2031 tagging cases counted, the algorithm was called in 400 eemes. 1631 cases were not called since they did not involve collocations (or involved trivial collocations such as ezpressed some fears.)
