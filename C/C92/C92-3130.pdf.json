Luhn[5] developed a very simple extraction method that searches for the keywords ill each sentence. This type nf abstraction is easy to accomplish, but its quality is poor. Other abstraction methods[6, 31 utilize natural language unders~ding (NLU). However NLU is still in the development stage. For achieving good practical performance, it is necessary to treat the thformation expressed in a tlocument uniformly so that it can be analyzed with only a small fixed amount of knowledge. We propose tile L.IS form which allows inlormatinn about events tO Lvd unilollnly treated, t;urt[lcl~nore, the semantE engine only uses abstract words, this reduces thc size of the knowledge. So the semuntic engine projects a sentence to a LIS form within a lmdted anloant of knowledge. In abstraction, classification is the first step. Classifica-tion is performed using unilorln approach, the LIS lkmn.

If two ino dividuals communicate about one that happened (will happen) m the real world, the core inlormation is the event. Sometm~es a spe,aker will atulche an attitude to the event. So information al~ml real world is expressed by the event and the attitude of tile speaker. 2.2 L1S form In the LIS form, there are two types of feature-structure, word feature-strncture and event feature-structure. Almost all slots of tile word feature-stxucture are filled with appropriate values and lew slots of the event feature-structure are empty. The semantic engine tries to fill all slots of lhe feature-structure. 2.2.1 Event feuture-str ucture Event has one leature-structure, the role lkkqture. The sentence conlilins one or more events and die event feature-structure indicates the role of words or phrases in the event. The role feature is either essential or extensional. Seven essential roles have been created: as AGENT, OB-JECT, ACTION, LOCATION, TIME, FROM, and TO. These roles are defined not for verbs but for events. This is quite diflerent li'om Fillmore's cases [2]. Therefore, the action ill the event is represented by the ACTION slot, which c~ln be lilled by verbs, nouns, gerunds, and so oil. It is not necessary to fill the ACTION slot by a verb. l:or exulnple, tile phra.sc \" a laud tmrchase agreement\" is dealt with as one event in the LIS, and the ACTION slot-value is \"agreement\". Other slots, such as AGENT, OBJECT, LOCAI'ION, TIME, FROM and TO slots are ahoost the same as in Fillmore's cases of 'agent', 'object', 'location', 'time', 'source', and 'goal (or experiencer)'. It is important that our role model deals with the roles of words (or pltrases) in an event, not word meaning. Using just seven essential roles, it is difficult to assign a talc to a word (or a phrase). To overcome this problem, AcrEs DECOL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOl~f 1992 8 7 5 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 we introduce extensional roles which allow to be moditied by the addition of \"/constraint\". 2,2.2 Word feature-structure Word has six features. These are semantic lizature (DDF) slot, numerical-value slot, date slot, constmtint slot, modality slot, and word string slot. Using the semantic feature, the event feature-structure will be determined during semantic interpretation process. Six classes of semantic features are defined, such as INDI-VIDUAL, ELEMENT, THING, ACTION, LOCATION, and TIME These classes are instantiated to the Domain Dependent semantic Features (DDF) when tile domain is decided. The constraint fcmure restricts the feature-su'ucturc of brother words or t)hrases. FurthcrlllOre, tile constraint feature determines the relations betweell word feature-structure and event feature-structure, ht Japanese language, a word which have a ACTION DDF usually has the constraint feature that determines tile slots of event feature-structure. The numerical-value slot expresses numerical value of a word ; 0, 1 , 2, -- (one) , ¢i (hundred) , :1\"- (thousand) , and so on. The calculation of countthg up and down is necessary, so all figures are separated.

In the Christian era, days are counted by numbers, so that date slots arc calculated nsing the numerieal-value feature. The date slot has a minute slot, a second slot, a hour slot, a day slot, a month slot, and a year slot. Eacll slot is expressed in nmnerical value. The modality slot is classilied into three c,'ttcgories; tense, aspect, and uqood. Since tile tense and aspect are linguistically Iixed, we use an ordinary categorization. However, mood is needed to be categorized differently, because the information unit used this system is an event. So we categorized mood as a combination of Bratman's Belief-Desire-lnten lion model[ 1 ] and modal logic. That is the skate of event is expressed hy modal logic (necessary operator, possible operator, and negation sign) and the attitude of speakers cart tx~ cthssiliod into belief, desire, and intention.

To perform semantic analysis with limited knowledge, word feature-structures are prepared only for abstract words. The registration of proper nouns are left to the user. The semantic engine infers the semantic meaning of words or phrases from the system default and user registrations held in the dictionary. This means the semantic engine do not need all knowledge of words for semantic interpretation. Thus only a small amount of words need to be maintained. After attaching the appropriate word feature-structure to all important words, semantic interpretation can proceed. From the type of propagation for the feature-structure in a parsing tree,there are two types of features. One is the synthesized type whose value is calculated from sons to fatber relationship of the parsing tree. The other is the inherited type that are calculated from father or brothers. Word string, DDF, numerical-value, date, and modality features are synthesized type and other features, such as consmdnt and role are inherited type. The propagation era feature-structure is accomplished by unification calculus, but the grammar is different. For DDF features, the grammar is as follows."]},{"title":"Ii'.I)DF","paragraphs":["::="]},{"title":"iml~ fini~e N.DDI'\"","paragraphs":["::= NI"]},{"title":".l)l)Fq~ N2.DDFq,...

First, a sentence is put into the LIS form by the semantic engine. TIle LIS output is used to commence the abstraction procedurc. To extract information from sentence, we think classilicaUon is tile best way. The semantic engine analyzes sentence in fixed domain, after the semantic attalysis. Sentences tire classilied whether an event or not, artd tile system extracts the events which are related to the domain. Finally, ABEX provides a abstraction. One abstraction proposed here is the classification of event occurrence time and similarity of event. This classification reveals the relationships of each event. Individual event occurrence times will be determnined from value of the time feature and the similarity of events is calculated by comparing event feature-structure slots. Tile other method is classification by the modality of information. Front the view point of Modalitytp, we can classify an event according to the modality of information possessor (1P). If there is no modality in the event, we classify it as 'fact'. Others are classified using modality feature. This classification of tile event's modality reveals the attitude of the information possessor.
