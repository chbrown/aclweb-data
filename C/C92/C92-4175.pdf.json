There are many different semantic theories which, because of their different notations, are difficult to compare. A general language which allows those theories to be implemented within it would offer an envirolnnent where similar semantic theories could be more easily evaluated.","Situation Theory (ST) has been developed over the last ten years [2]. Much work has been done in both tlle formal aspects of situation theory and its use in natural language semantics (situation semantics), however so far little work has been dram ill its computational aspects. It is the eventual goal of tile work presented here to show how situation theory can be used computationally and how a computational situation theoretic language call provide an enviromnent ill which different semantic theories call I)e easily compared.","Because there are so many variants of ST we must define our own here. The language ASTL [3] has been defined. Althongb it uses surprisingly few features of situation theory, it seems powerful enough to act as a basic language for semantics. It has been considered that somc extension to \"classical\" feature structures be made and use those to encode semantic forms. Features systems augmented with set vahms, eyclicity and other extensions may be powerful enough but the method described here takes an existing semantic theory and refines it rather than building a new one.","This paper is ba.sically split into two sections. Tlw first discusses how ST can be used in a computational system, and introduces the language ASTL. The second half of this paper discusses Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) as a theory in itself and shows how it can be encoded with ASTL."]},{"title":"ST and Computation","paragraphs":["The view according to situation theory is that parts of the \"world\" can be described as situations. Situations support facts. Facts can be true, false, or undefined in some situation. A fact's truth value may be different in different situations. Situations are tirst class objects in the theory, and hence they can be used as arguments to facts so that relations can be defined between situations. Situations are useful in translations for naked infinitives (e.g. \"see\") Situations make ST different from more conventional logical theories although there have been proposals to add situation-like objects to more classical theories like Montagne grammar [8].","As well as situations and partiality, situation theory offers many other iutensional objects, in-cluding abstractions, types, and parameters (partially determined objects). These form a rich for-realism for describing semantic phenomena. However these features alone do not constitute a computational system, with tile addition of constraints and rules of inference we call have the basis for a computatimlal system. The idea of a computational situation theoretic language has been considercd elsewhere. Most notable is the language PRosv[' [9] which offers a Prolog-like language based on situation theory rather than first order logic. Other systems (e.g. [5]) allow the representation of situations etc. within some other formalism (e.g. feature structures) but do not use situation theory itself as the basis for the language."]},{"title":"ASTL","paragraphs":["ASTL is a language based on situation theory. It takes a very conscrvative view of situation theory, admitting only some basic parts. Although ASTL may need to be extended later, it already can be used to describe simple versions of semautic theories (such ms situation semantics and DRT). Rather than use, or extend, PROSlT it was decided to develop a new language. ASTL includes stone built-ill support for natural language parsing based on tile ideas of Situation Theoretic Grammar [4] while PRoslrr is designed more for knowledge representation than direct language processing.","ASTL allows the following basic terms: Individuals : e.g. a, b, c.

DRT [7] ota~rs a representat, ion lot discourses. A discourse rcprcsenlalion structure (I)RS) is dctined at each stage in a discourse describing the cllrrellt state of the analys/8.

They are not themselves representations of the utterances but representations of whal tile utterances describe. Threading An iml>ortant aspect of I)RT is how a I)RS is constructed from a discourse. Here (and in [6]) we use tile technique of threading. Tile general idea is that a DH.S gets passed through a discoarse being added to as the discourse l)rogresses.","hi this description, a discourse consists of a set of utterance situations which call In' viewed tim)ugh a number of different structural relations, The tirsl is through tile relation daughter which defines tile syntactic structure of lhe discourse as defined by the grammar rules (immediate doininance and linear precedence). Secondly the thread rdal.ion defines an ordering of tile ntlerance situaliens used in the generation of the l)RSs. I,aslly there are two relations, range and body lined ill defining the logical structure of the discourse.","The threading relation is a binary relation between utterance situations. We will say the first argument is threaded to tile second. Each utterance situation appears exactly once a,S the second argument in tile thread relation (i.e. il. has exactly one incoming thread). There is one exeeplion, a special situation called DStart which does not have an incoming thread (it is used to represent the null context at the start of a discourse), bm does appear as all incoming thread for one or more utterance situations. There are no cycles m threadhlg but as we shall see there may be more than one linked thread of utterances within a discourse. The actual construction of the threading relations is discussed later.","Each utterance situation is related to two DRSs, through tim relations DRSIn and DRSOut. A DRSIn DRS is tim DRSOut DRS of the incoming thread. Tiffs constraint can be written in ASTL o~'-; *S:[S ! S !-<<DRSIn,S,*DRS,I>>] <= TS:[TS ! TS != <<thread,*Sl,*$,l>>],","*SI: [S1 ! S1 != <<DRSBut,SI,*DRS,I>>] . The relation between the two DRSs related to an utterance is also constrained, This is a core part of DRT. Basically the outgoing DRS contains the same information as the mcnming DRS plus any reformation the utterance adds to the discourse. In the cruse of a proper noun utterance situation we can capture this relation with the following constraint:","*S:[S ! S != <<DRSout,S,*DRSout:: *DRSlnType k [D !

We are not destructively modifying a DRS as the discourse progresses but constructing a new DRS which supports the same conditions as the incoming DRS. The constraint above forms the outgoing I)RS from the type (*DRSInType) of tile incoming one, which will contain all the conditions of the incoming DRS, plus a new condition introducing the parameter for the I)roper noun and a condition on its name.","We also have tile constraint that any argument or relation that appears in the conditions of a DRS must be related to some utterance situation by the relation sere previously ill that thread. This condition means that argnments are threaded before predicates. For example both the subject NP and object NP of a simple sentence will be threaded l)efore the VP. In eontrmst in [6] tile VP comes before a object NP which means a I)RS is created with an argmnent in a condition which is not yet determined (i.e. a free variable).","The other structural relations are range and body Each determiner utterance situation appears in exactly one range-relation and exactly one body-relation.

This is perhaps unfair to consider this as a problem as m the standard definitions of DR?I' it is required that the model be complete (all propertics are defined on all objects) - so it seems no worse to require this of the situation in which we are finding tile trnth conditions of a 1)RS. llowever we could include further definitions for the every relation and require that there be some resource situation that identifies actual objects that fall in its scope.

A possible translation of I)I~T in ASTL is given. The coverage is that of [6].","This translation is interesting because first it shows that situation theory is not some opposing semantic theory but that it can be used ill discussing other theories, tIowever perhaps it is not surprising that a language such as ASTL is powerful enough to give this translation. A feature system, with sets (or some definition), cycles and constraints is close to what ASTL is, but it is interesting that these properties can be found as the basis ill a current semantic theory without introducing a new theory. Finally a situation theoretic description of DRT allows extensions of DRT to use the properties of situation theory. Situations which are useful ill describing various natural language semantic phenomena (e.g. naked infinitives) are now readily available to be included in exteusious of DRT.
