ABSTRACT This paper describes the lexical database tool LOLA (Linguistic-Oriented Lexical database Approach) which has been developed fur the construction and maintenance of lexicons for the maclfine translation system I,MT. First, the requirements such a tool should meet are discussed, then I,MT and the lexical information it requires, and some issues concerning vocabulary acquisition are presented. Afterwards the architecture aml the components of the I,OLA system are described and it is shown how we tried to meet the requirements worked out em'- hier. Although I,OI,A originally has been designed and implemented for the German-English I,MT prototype, it aimed from the beginning at a representation of lexical data that can be reused for uther LMT or MT prototypes or even other NLP applications. A special point of discussion will therefore be the adaptability of the tool and its cumponents as well as the reusability of the lexical data stored in the database for the lexicon development for I,MT or for other applications."]},{"title":"i. Introduction","paragraphs":["The availability of large-scale lexical information has widely been recognized as a bottleneck in the construction of Natural Language Processing (NLI') systems.

This work is part of the objectives of the project Transl,exis launched in 1991 at the Institute of Knowledge Based Systems of the IBM Germany Scientific Center. Transl,exis aims at the theoretically and empirically well motivated lexical description and the management of the lexical information of LMT in a database.

The Database","paragraphs":["The database was desi~md iu two steps: developmerit of the conceptual scheme and dcvclopment of tim database scheme. In the conceptual design phase, the lexical objects, ttmir properties, and their interrelations were represented in an entity-relatinnship diagram (of. I,MT is file technical basis of an international project at IBM wifll cooperation between IBM Researdl, tile IBM Science Centers in lleidelberg, Madrid, Paris, llaifa, and Cairo, and IBM European l.anguage Services in Copenhagen (cf. Rimon et al. 1991). 2 Cf. Byrd et al. 1987; for an overview of related activities within file l,MT-project, cL Rimon et al. 1991, pp. 14-15. Cf. Barnett et al. 1986; Blumenthal et al. 1988; Storrer 1990. Ac~s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ao(Tr 1992 5 1 l PROe. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 Chen 1976). Although the ER-model does not have the expressive power to cover all aspects of lcxical description, especially complex constraints, it has been chosen here as a compromise between a cmnplete lexical representation and the realization in a traditional database system. The resulting ER-diagram for the German-English lexicon is shown in Figure 2 a . The conceptual scheme is still independent of the choice of a specific DBMS and of other implementation aspects. The basic principles of the conceptual design of our database will be sketched out in the following. Orientation towards linguistic structure, not towards the structure of the application lexicon. The diagram reflects, in the first place, the structure of the linguistic objects, their properties and and their interrelations, and it is influenced to a smaller degree by the structure of the application lexicon. As a consequence, the data is quite resistant to structural changes hi the format of the application lexicon. The abstraction from the structures of the application lexicon has a positive side effect with regard to the exploitation of machine readable lexicai resources: on one hand, we can handle cases, in which not all information required by LMT is provided in the entries of MRD's. The information acquired can be stored as entries to be completed and revised later. On the other hand, we are free to store types of lexical information that are of relevance for NLP applications and can be acquired from MRD's or other NLP lexicons but are not processed in a current LMT-version. We can save them in the database as coding aids for the lexicographers, for future prototype versions, or other NLP applications. Analogous structure for source and target language wherever possible. The lower part of the ER-diagram represents the German source, tile upper part tile English target language. For both languages, an entity of the type entry can have one or more homonyms, each of which can have one or more senses. The senses themselves can open one or more sense-specific slots (one-to-many relations). A sense-specific slot can be filled by several types of fillers and the same type of filler can flU several sense-specific slots (many-to-many relation). The basic types of entities and relations, which are the same for all languages, are described by their characteristic features represented as attributes. The number of attributes as well as their values may differ according to language-specific peculiarities s . Many-to-many relations between the lexical objects of both languages. We represent the relation of lexical equivalence between source and target senses, as a many-to-many relation (one source sense can have multiple target equivalents and vice versa). This breaks with the traditional hierarchical entry structure of bilingual dictionaries (Calzolari et at. 1990), but it avoids redundant description and storage of one target sense that is lexically equivalent to different source senses. Another relation holds for the sense-specific slots of two senses that are regarded as lexicMly equivalent. We decided to establish this relation between slots and not between slot frames. This way we caaa elegantly describe lexically equivalent senses with non-corresponding slotframes ~ . In this way the relations between the two languages may be used to a great extent bidirectionally for the XY- as well as for tbe YX-language pair. The conceptual scheme captured in the ER-diagram was then mapped into a database scheme and implemented in tile relational DBMS SQL/DS. We chose a relational DBMS, because -- for the maintenance of the large LMT-GE lexicon (about 50,000 entries) -- we were in need of a stable DBMS which supports multi-user access, has facilities for automatic checking of consistency and integrity of the lexical data mad allows for the specification of multiple user-specific views on the data. To avoid redundancy and update anomalies we tried to normalize our relations as far it was useful with respect to our approach. In total, 32 tables are implemented: 25 tables describe lexical objects and relations by means of attributes with associated values, 7 tables serve to store \"knowledge about the lexical knowledge\", e.g. the admitted values for attributes sucia as semantic type, filler-type, slot-type for both languages. 2.2. COLOLA: the user interface to LOLA COLOLA is the user interface to LOLA-DB that looks up the lexical data of a given search word and displays it on sequentially connected menus. The design of the menus as well as their sequential order was guided by the manner in which lexicographers describe lexical entries. The following operations can be performed:","4 The boxes represent types of entities, the diamonds represent types of relations between entities, the ellipses represent attributes which characterize types of entities or relations. The labels of the connection lines indicate whether the relation in question is a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many relation. The ER-diagram is a simplified version of the actual conceptual model. For the purpose of this paper, several entity types, attributes, and relations have been leR out.","s E.g.: in German a preposition like \"auf' can govern either an accusative NP (\"warren auf') or a dative NP (\"lasten auf') depending on the verb that lakes the prepositional phrase with the respective preposition as a complement. Therefore \"case\" is a feature, relevant for the description of German slot fillers filling a prepositional complement slot,","s E.g. cases like \"like\" and \"gefallen\" where the subject of the English verb corresponds to the dative object of the German verb; or cases like \"geigen\" and \"play the violin\" where the English direct object filler \"the violin\" is incorporated in the semantics of the German verb \"geigen\".

For each part of speech, a specific sequence of menus is defined. There are ntcnus for homonyms and senses of source and target entries; the qinkiug\" of the source senses and target senses regarded to be lexically equivalent is clone via transfer menus. This allows lexicographers to spcci~dize on specific parts of speech or on specific fi~atures which can be locally updated. COI,OLA controls multi-user access to the LOI,A-I)B so tltat several lexicographers (:an update the lcxical database simultaneously. The logical unit of work is the source or target homonym: when a lcxicngraphcr rcqucsts to update a homonynt, this homonym, together with its senses, is locked tar other users. If a new entry contains blanks, a multiword menu is called where the multiword is split up into its components. For each component, the following lexical information is gathered: the part of speech, whether the word may inflect within the multiword, and whether a phrase can be inserted between one multiword component mKl tire previous one with-out doing away with idiomaticity. If new hotnonylus or 8ellses ;:ire inserted ou the multiword menu as well as on other menus, default wducs for tcaturcs arc displayed. They can either be accepted or rejected and overwrittcn by the lcxiengraphcr 7 . The assumptions on dethult values for attributes nf lcxical intbrmation may differ according to diffcrcnt grammars and systems. We therefore decided to store the complete lexJcal in-fbrmatinn and use dcfault wdues as proposals in tire user interface. With this approach we aUow for two advantages: on one hand, the data in thc database can be used lot difllsreut appficatinrts having distinct theory specific assumptions on defaults. On the other hand, the user of CO1,OI,A can bcuetit li'om the economic advantages ()f default assumptions. C()I~OLA does extensive crmsistency chccking of the values entered by tire lexicographers. Illegal values arc rejected and warning messages are displayed in situations where errors nfight easily occur. Although much of tim consistency cttecking is sup.. pnrted by the database management system, some extensions were necessary. Further support for the lexicographers is provided by an interface tn the WordSmith nn-linc dictit)nary system (cf. Byrd/Neff 1987). Several machine readable dictionaries are available e.g. Collins German-tinglish, F, nglish-German, Longman's I)ictionai T of Contemporary l':uglish, and Webster 7th Collegiate dictionary. The lexicographer can look up entries in these dictionaries during the encoding process. Furthermore, help menus are provided in which ttre vMid values tbr specific features can be looked tip.","7 Default values are provided, for instance, for slot fillers. German direct objcct slots get an accusative noun phrase as lhe default filler. The lexicographers may accept this, add other fillers or write over it with ann(fief filler.

In the database, the description of linguistic entities and their interrelatkms is given in a set of tables where specitic values air stored lor the characteristic attributes of each individual entity. On these tables, different views can be defined for different types of users, l)iffercnt programs (like I)B TO I,MT) can extract exactly the attribute values needed fur their respective appficatiou and convert them into each given format. This way, from one and the same data base several lexicons can be generated, in which the same \"lhaguistic world' is structured differently or represented in a completely ditti~rent way. The possibilities of reusability ,are naturally defined and limited by thc number of the registered types of lexical information in the origin',d data base. As far as the LOI,A database is concerned, the very detailed description of slot frames as well as the information about nmltiwords and the properties of their emnponents may be reused for other NLP applicatkms with one of the languages inwflved. The reusability of the transter intormation (specitied in the transfer relations between the languages of a given language pair) for other MT systems depends highly on the respective MT approach. As to the question of rcusabilty of the data in the LMT system \"family\", three different cascs have to be distinguished:","1. lexical-data description given for a source language X is reused for another language pair having X as source language,","2. lexical-data description given for a source language X is reused for another language pair having X as target language,","3. lexical-data description given for a target language Y is reused for another language pair having Y as source language. In the tirst two cases, reusability of tim lexical data of language X is very high. In tim ttfird case, the description of Y as source 1;mguage may have to be more detailed in order to achieve ml adequate syntactic analysis n . New attributes or even new types of entities or relationships may be needed mad the database scheme will have to be etd~aneed accordingly. 4. Outlook Our long-term goal is a multilingnal database, in wlfich the lexical knowledge tbr each language in-volved in the 1,MT project is represented only once. Application lexicons lor I,MT prototypes with different language pairs arc generated by extracting tile requitvd informatiun from the database and by converting it into the respective l,MT-format. Furthermore, tim tool is to be extended in such a way that it is not restricted to the construction of MT lexicons, hut c~m also be used as a terminology workbench and thus support tim construction and m;dntenance of terminology. An integra|ed MT and tcrminulogy database would have the advantage that the Icxical knowledge encoded by terminnlogists aud translators can be used by tim tr,'ulslalkm system as wclh For refinement and completion of the description of the German language, it is pl~mned to integrate lurtber i~ffurmation from available Gerinan NI,I' lexicons into the I,OI,A-DII. A basic proldem concerning this undertaking will bc to identify and to match the basic categories \"entries\", \"homonyms\", \"senses\", which arc detined in various Icxical resources according to diffbrent criteria, only some nf which being transparent. With this erfurt, we hope to gain Ihrther knowledge on the limits and possibilities concerning the reusability tff lexical data. 5. References Barnett, B., 11. l,ehmann, M.
