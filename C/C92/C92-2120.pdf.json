Japanese is considered to be a free word/phrase order language. Since syntactic rules are applied as constraints to reduce the search space in speech recognition, applying rules which take into account all possible phrase orders can have almost the same effect as using no constraints. Instead, we take into consideration the recognition weaknesses of certain syntactic categories and treat them precisely, so that a miuimal number of rules can work most effectively. In this paper we first examine which syntactic categories are easily misrecognized. Second, we consult our dialogue corpus, in order to provide the rules with great generality. Based ou both stndies, we refine the rules. Finally, we verify the validity of the refinement through speech recognition experiments."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We are developing the Spoken Language Tl~ANSlation system (SL-TRANS)[1], in which both speech recognition processing and natural language processing arc integrated. Currently we are studying automatic speech translation from Japanese into English in the domain of dialogues with the re ception service of an international conference office. In this framework we are constructing syntactic rules for recognition of Japanese speech. In speech recognition, the most significant concern is raising the recognition accuracy. For that purpose, applying linguistic information turns out to be promising. Various approaches have been taken, such as using stochastic models[2], syntactic rules[3], semantic information[4] and discourse plans[5]. Among stochastic models, the bigram and trigram succeeded in achieving a high recognition accuracy in languages that have a strong tendency toward a standard word order, such as English. On the contrary, Japanese belongs to free word order languages[6]. For such a language, semantic information is more adequate a.s a constraint. However, building semantic constraints for a large vocabulary needs a tremendous amount of data. Currently, our data consist of dialogues between the conference registration office and prospective conference participants with approximately 199,000 words in telephone conversations and approximately 72,000 words in keyboard conversations. But our data are still not sufficient to build appropriate semantic constraints for sentences with 700 distinct words. Processing a discourse plan re-quires excessive calculation and the study of discourse itself must be further developed to be applicable to speech recognition. On the other hand, syntax has been studied in more detail and makes increasing the vocabulary easier. As we are working on spoken language, we try to reflect real language usage. For this purpose, a stochastic approach beyond trigrams, namely stochastic sentence parsing[7], seems most promising. Ideally, syntactic rules should be generated automatically from a large dialogue corpus and probabilities should also be automatically assigned to each node. But to do so, we need underlying rules. Moreover, coping with phoneme perplexity, which is crucial to speech recognition, with rules created frmn a dialogue corpus, re-quires additional research[8]. In this paper we propose taking into account tile weaknesses of the speech recogniton system in the earliest stage, namely when we construct underlying syntactic rules. First, we examined the speech recognition results to determine which Syntactic categories tend to be recognized erroneously. Second, we utilized our dialogue corpus[9] to support the refinement of rules concerning those categories. As examples, we discuss formal nouns 1 and conjunctive postposi~ions 2. Finally, we carried out a speech recognition experiment with the refined rules to verify the validity of our approach. 1 Formal noun~ : keishiki-meishi in Japanese.

The system predicts phonetnes by using an LR parsing table and drives IIMM phoneme verifiers to detect/verify them without any interven-ing structure, such as a phoneme lattice. The speech recognition unit is a Japanese bunselsu, which roughly corresponds to a phrase and is the next largest unit after the word. The ending of the bunselsu (phrase) is usually marked by a breath point. This justities its treatment as a distinct unit. A Japanese phrase consists of one independent word (e.g. noun, adverb, verb) and zero, one or more than one dependent words (e.g. postposition, auxiliary verb). The nmnber of words in a phreLse ranges from 1 to 14, and the mean number is about 3, according to our dialogue corpus. We will clarify the weaknesses of HMM-Llt speech recognition both in phrases and in sentences."]},{"title":"2.1 Phrase Recognition Errors","paragraphs":["We examined which syntactic categories tmtd to be erroneously recognized, when using IIMM-LR pltraae speech recognition.

While (3) is affirmative, 3b is interrogative, which is indicated by the sentence final postposition ka. This cannot be treated with sentence rules. To haudle this problem, we need dialogue management. The uttered phrase kochira-~a in (4), meaning \"this,\" was recognized erroneously as kat.a-wa in 4a, meaning \"person.\" The word kata belongs to the formal noun group, a kind of noun which should be modified by a verbal phrase [13]. Sentence 4a is acceptable, if modified by a verbal phrase, as in 4a':","4a': midori-no seihukn-o kiteiru kata-wa kaigizimukyoku-desu (The person who is wearing a green uniform is [with] the conference office.)

In sentence candidates 5a and 5b, the numeral go, meaning \"five,\" is used. These sentences may seem strange at first glance, but in a situation such as playing cards, these sentences are quite natural. If someone plays a 5 when you need one, you would say: \"Thanks for the five.\" Similarly, when you need a 3 and a 5, and someone plays a 3 and after that someone else plays a 5, you would say: \"Thanks for the five, too.\" In the sentence candidate 6a, the conjunetiveposlposilion (conj-pp) shi is used sentence finally. In principle, a conj~pp combines two sentences, function-ing like a conjunction, such as \"while\" and \"though,\" and is used in the middle of a sentence. Erroneous sentence recognition such as in the case of 3a-b cannot be treated by sentence rules. Therefore, we are trying to cope with erroneous recognition, as seen in sentence candidates 4a, 5a-c and 6a, with sentence rules."]},{"title":"3 Dealing with Speech Recognition Errors","paragraphs":["We are going to deal with sentences containing tile following phrases: • Phrases with formal nouns • Phrases with numerals • Phrases with conj-pps used in the sentence final position In order to decide how to cope with the above problems, we used our dialogue corpus. Currently we have 177 keyboard conversations consisting of approximately 72,000 words and 181 telephone conversations consisting of approxilnately 199,000 words 7. We regard keyboard conversations as representing written Japanese and telephone conversations as representing spoken Japanese. When retrieving the dialogue corpus, we always compare written and spoken Japanese, in order to clarify the features of the latter. We examined the actuM usage of formal nouns as well as that of eonj-pps. 3.1 Formal Nouns We examined the behavior of formal nouns, such as koto and mono. Formal nouns are considered to be a kind of noun which lacks the content usually found in common nouns such as \"sky\" or \"apple.\" They function similarly to relative pronouns and therefore are used with a verbal modifier[13], as in examples 7 and 8: 7 : kinou ilia koto~wa torikeshitai. (I would like to take back what I said yesterday.)","8 : nedan-ga takai mono-ga shitsu-ga ii wakedewanai. (It is not always true that an expensive thing has good quality.) In examples 7 and S, the formal nouns, kolo and mono, are modified by kinou ilia (yesterday said) and nedan-ga takai (price expensive), respectively. But it is also true that these nouns behave like common nouns and can be used without any verbal modifier, as in examples 9 and 10: 9 : sore-wa koto desu ne. 7The dialogue corpus is ?.rowing constantly. When we retrieved formM nouns, we had 113 keyboard conversations and 96 telephone conversations. ACTES DE COLING-92, NANa~2S, 23-28 AOUT 1992 8 0 8 PROC.

AIM we decided to treat numerals only in a restricted en-- vironment, because they are significant noise factors in speech rccognitionS: • Phrases with formal nouns nmst be modified. • Phrases with numerals can be used only ill certain environments. Numerals are allowed in addresses, telephone numbers, dates aim prices.

Another condition, sue]l as playing cards, will be treated when speech recognition is further improved. • We classify conj-pps into two groups: conj-pps which call be used in the sentence final position as well as in the milldlc of a sentence, and conj-pps which can be used only ill the nfiddle of a seutence.

For constructing rules we took into account the error tendency in speech recognition. We treated precisely those syntactic categories which tend to be recognized erroneously. To increase the efficacy of each rule, the rule construction is strongly motivated by our dialogue corpus. By applying the refined phrase-based syntactic rules, the speech recognition rate for the top candidates improved from 37.2 % to 70.1% and for the top 5 candidates from 73.7 % to 83.9 %. The implementation of syntactic rules bascd on our dialogue corpus is continuing in order to increase coverage. Currently we are studying postposition deletion in nominal phrases, which is one of the features of spoken Japanese. When adding rules and enlarg-ing vocabulary, we cammt avoid decreasing speech recognition accuracy, but our further experiments showed that careful rule construction filtered out unacceptable sentence candidates much more effectively. Though we believe that our dialogue corpus for the, current domain provides enough expressions of spoken Japanese, we are going to apply the same method to other domains to establish the generality of the rules.
