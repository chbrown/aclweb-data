In the light of this, machine translation is considered as being an application of paramount importance. It is for this reason that the activities of B'VITAL have always centered around the processing of technical texts.","The following article gives an account of the various tasks carried oat over the last few years on corpus analysis. We have drawn conclusions as to the validity of the notion of text typologies, applied in particular to technical matter, with a view to developing a machine translation system. The study was conducted using a fair amount of French documents and has led us to observe in particular, that a same typology may be identified in texts originating from varying fields."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["The technical literature of a nuclear plant represents about 150 000 pages (figure quoted by EDF, France, in 1990). About 20 000 pages make up the maintenance literature of a an aircraft, of which 5 000 are subject to revision every three months on average.","In France, the cost per page for a translation varies from 250 to 400 francs for a translation from French to one of the other European languages (according to Bossard Consultants), which amounts to 6 million francs for the maintenance literature of an aircraft.","If a machine translation system is able to reduce considerably the time spent per page by translators, even if the result is not perfect, it will signify a gain with respect to delivery times and costs.","To avoid problems concerning non standardised terminology, we have endeavoured to stick to the terms familiar to traditional grammar, even though they may not always be appropriate. I wiah to thank my colleagues, D. Baehut, O. Gamrat and M.C. Puerta, for their help."]},{"title":"1 - DEFINITION OF THE CORPUS STUDY","paragraphs":["According to our method, based on GETA's works (Grenoble), if the MT system comes across a non handled phenomenon, the sentence is not rejected and translation is carried through using those parts of the sentence which have been successfully analysed (CL [1] & [2]). Within the framework of an industrial application in which the ratio of development costs to gain in quality is preponderant, rare phenomena may thus be handled in a very simplified way, or even not handled at all.","Midway between controlled syntax systems and systems 'which translate everything', our approach to MT favours the development of systems adapted, a posteriori, to the texts to be translated. This theory goes by the assumption that it is possible to define and then recognise the typology of texts, specifying in particular their form, the linguistic phenomena present or absent and the general vocabulary used (excluding terminology).","The study, which was strongly influenced by the MT application, began in 1984, during the French Projet National de Traduction Automatique (PNTAO), with an intensive research phase. It is still currently in progress although only sporadically, with the study of new texts. The first study aimed at proving that it was possible to define a typology for the given corpus. Its result was the definition of an initial typology (less restrictive than the METEO typology for instance, see [6]), which was further refined (though not radically changed) during the years which followed. The definition of file typology retained consisted of a list of the phenomena handled, in other words, a list of the static grammar charts (Cf. [2] & [3]) which are part of the linguistic specifications of the system. We will not give a full formal explanation of the defined typology, however, we will view it from a more informal point of view.","The whole corpus was made up of documents in French provided by different fh'ms (Sonovision, SITE, A6rospatiale, EDF, Rh6ne Poulenc, Syseca...). It consists mainly of aeronautical documents (maintenance documents, job cards...), data processing texts (extracts from reference documents or from user guides, or ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~T 1992 I 2 8 4 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992","software error messages), minutes of meetings, extracts","from work schedules or from technico-commercial","documents.","The aeronautical documents which make up the","greater part of the corpus (about 50%), maintenance","manuals and job cards, were initially chosen as the basic","corpus for the PN'fAO for ,several reasons : they were available ill machine readable form, at Souovisiou (which later became the SITE group), they corresponded to a consklerable commercial need, they concerned a sector of strong export activity, they were representative of a large number of technologies (mechanics, data processing, fluid mechanics, strength of materials, etc.).","It is for these reasons that they coustitute even","today, an important source of enrichment for the corpus.","The initial corpus was made up of about","400 pages taken from maintenance and service guides of","Marcel Dassault aircraft. Part of the texts, provided with","the English translation, were made up of job cards. I~tch","job card indicates how to go about a specific servicing","operation.

The main difference is","at form level : the first type of text contains enumerated instructions, generally described using short phrases without fnll stops and which do not exist in the second type of text.","'the purpose for extending the study was to iuvestigate the possible existing differences amongst various types of documents in various fields. It turned out that most of the literature iulended for technicians COlXespouds to the original typology.","Amongst the other corpora studied (about 800 pages form various fields, e.g. electrical installation manuals, computer manuals and advetlisiug, software manuals and advertising, aeronautical texts, description of composite materials, maintenance documentation for mechanical installations, etc.), we have classified the texts into two groups :","texts pertinent to the initial corpus, in other","words those texts whose typology was identical","or closely re~sembled that of the first corpus,","non-pertinent texts containing new phenomena.","311is second type of text will probably require a","sub-categorisatiou into other typologies (a task","not as yet carried out).","Typology is field independent. We have received extracts tiom aeronautical documents, provided by Adrospatiale. Some of these texts tall into the non-pertinent category, while others fall into rite pertinent category. Furthermore, it was found that texts originating h'om different fields (data processing or electrical engineering, for example) fell into the typology.","Amongst the non-pertinent texts we found mainly texts which require rewriting rather than Ixanslatinn, lot instance user manuals (at least those intended for non specialists), scientific articles, advertising and legal texts. Such texts are obviously less adapted to MT. We al~ found minutes of meetings and client service reports, whose syntax is often very f,.mciful.","As far as quantity goes, the volume of technical taatter is much greater than that of advertising and legal matter (Cf. Van Dijk consultancy figures), Maintenance and service guides, intended for specialists, and referetlce guides represent a much greater volume than that of user guides, intended for non-specialists (which are less hoxnogenoas typologically speaking). 2 - RESULT OF THE CORPUS STUDY","The study laid rile emphasis on the problems directly related to tn, mslation, in particular with respect to accuracy,","The sub-sections wlfich follow illustrate tile defined typology mid instance the linguistic phenomena not encountered in the so-called pertinent texts studied.

It is likely that all the possible types of noun phrases exist in the corpus. We observed with interest that in some cases, the groups were quite often barely\" grmnmatically acceptable. The principle of juxtaposing nouns in French is a rare phenomena. All the same, juxtaposition is quite a generalised pratice in the texts studied (this is probably the case for a lot of technical texts). The following juxtapositions are normally accepted :","I'antenne I~ACAN","I'ensemble raccord-bouchon","un syst~me de type ba~onnette","Whereas the following are less acceptable grammatically speaking :","I'ensemble de hissage avion","Iongueur part i e ] Isse","I'axe avlon","The following complex examples inuslrate the degree of complexity noun phrases may attain (the part of the sentence which is not the noun phrase is bracketed) :","(11 proc~de) de la technique des","refroidisseurs 9 surfaces secondalres,","appel~,s retroidisseurs a lames et","intercalaires ou refroidisseurs compacts","qui convlent particuli~,rement bten au gaz","ayant un mauvais coefficient d'echange","thermique.","Verb nominalisation (verbiaction noun derivation) is also frequently used :","... effectuer une v~riflcation du tarage...","(rather than v#rifier le forage)",",., proc~der ~ la d~pose des panneaux...","Faire une verification du reglage...","These structures are built using a small number of French verbs (loire, effectuer,...), and they are used with all nominalisations of verbs of action. Idiomatic expressions","We class idiomatic expressions as being variable or non-variable expressions, which require identification within a text in order to ensure correct translation. Idiomatic expressions exist in all the syntactic categories. Nominal idiomatic expressions are probably the most frequent, particularly in specialised terminology (more than 80 % of the temis are nominal idiomatic expressions, in aeronaalical termiuology).","Without going into further detail, it can be said that they are all present in the corpus. However, only a relatively small number of verbal expressions can be found (in comparison with the potential wealth of the French language) and there has been no example of a transformation of these expressions (for example les mesures qui doivent ~tre prises) in the corpus.

OF COL1NG-92, NAN'I]~S. AUG. 23-28, 1992 Although not totally absent, personal pronouns are rare in technical texts (one per page on average). None of the personal pronouns encountered referred to a human (in fact, humans are rarely referred to in the texts) in the pextinent corpus. This information meant that for the French-English system, personal pronouns would always be \"it\" (or \"they\") as it is not necessary to search for the refcmmce.","Rhetorical figures Rhetorical figures are rare and correspond to established usages. Only one metaphor was encountered in the texts : .. les commandes chemlnent sur le cot~ droll sous le plancher passager.. The problem is solved \"at dictionary level, given that a cable can cheminer (make its way). The metonyms encountered appear to be accepted metonyms which are transposable into the target language. Thus, in the above example, the term commandes which represents the cable or cables which propagate the controls, is literally translated into English, without shocking the technicians of the field. Anaphora are rare, and as with personal pronouns, if encountered could be handled in a simplified way.","Finally, with regard to the aspectual","phenomena, in French, syntactically speaking, there is","very little aspectual indication.

Firstly, it has enabled the definition of a text typology which is pertinent to a considerable volume of texts of different origins and different technical fields (although this excludes in particular computer user guides and documents for the general public).","The definition of this typology has enabled us to draw up accurate linguistic specifications, simplifying and sometimes ignoring the handling of certain linguistic phenomena. The specifications were then used to develop an FAT system (based on GETA's system, ARIANE), whose grammars are less complex, and hence easier to maintain. The quality of translation, tested on a important number of aeronautical texts (maintenance guides) and on several specimens of pertinent texts, have proved the validity of this approach : revision times varied from 20 to 30 minutes per page (average translation times in SITE is about 1 page per hour).","The study of texts of different typologies has enabled as to pinpoint the limits of a minimal language, used in all types of texts, and hence the indispensable kernel of any new typology.","From an economic point of view, the texts targeted by the typology described here represent a considerable amount of the documents to be translated.","BIBLIOGRAPHY","[1] BACHUT, D., & al., \"Industrialisation d'un syst~me de TAO fran~ais-anglais pour la documentation technique\", G6nie Linguistique 91, Versailles, 1991.","[2] BOITET, Ch., & al., \"ARIANE-78: an integrated environment for automated translation and human revision\", COLING~82, Prague, 1982.","[3] BorI'ET, Ch., \"The French National Mr-Project: Technical organization and translation results of CALLIOPE-AERO\", IBM Conf. on Translqtion Mechanization, Copenhagtm, 1986.","[4] BOITET, Ch., \"Current Machine Translation systems developed with GETA's methodology and software tools\", ASLIB, London, 1986.","[5] BOITET, Ch., \"Current state and future outlook of the research at GETA\", MT Summit, Hakone, 1987.","[6] CHANDIOUX, J., \"METEO: un syst~me op6rationoel pour la traduction des bulletins mtttorologiques destints au grand public\", Meta 21, 1976.","[7] CHAPPUY, S., \"Formalisation de la description des niveaux d'interprttation des langues naturelles\", Th~se 3e cycle informatique, Grenoble, 1983.","[8] HUTCHINS, W.J., \"MACHINE TRANSLATION: past, present, future\", Chichester, Ellis Horwood series in Computer and their applications, 1986.
