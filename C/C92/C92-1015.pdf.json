Bird@edinburgh. ac. uk ABSTRACT Attention on constraint-based grammar formalisms such as Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPS6) has focussed on syntax and semantics to the exclusion of phonology. This paper investigates the incorporation of a non-procedural theory of phonology into rmSG, based on the 'one-level' model of Bird & Ellison (1992). The standard rule-representation distinction is replaced by the description-object distinction which is more germane in the context of constraint-based grammar. Prosodic domains, which limit the applicability of phonological constraints, are expressed in a prosodic type hierarchy modelled on lfPSG'S lexical type hierarchy.

While there is an element of truth in this, it is also true that the predilection of constraint-based grammarians for a string-based phonology has predisposed them towards segmental phonology, in which procedural thinking is at its peak. Other varieties of phonology--most notably non-linear phonology (Goldsmith, 1976, et seq.)--have now largely abandoned complex derivational accounts of phonological well-formedness in favour of systems of generalised constraints. A defining property of constraints is that they are not applied in any particular order. Rice (1989, 331) writes that \"a general goal","IThis research is funded by the U.K. Science and Engineer-ing Research Council, under grant GR/G-22084 Computational Phonology: A Constraim-Based Approach. I am grateful to Mark Ellison, Ewan Klein and Bob Ladd for discussions relating to this work. in recent phonological work has been the elimination of structure-changing processes from the grammar.\" With structure-changing process gone, all that constraints do is specify what it means for surface forms to be well-formed 2. A consequence of this paradigm shift in phonology is that the main barrier to the incorporation of phonology into constraint-based grammar frameworks has now disappeared.","In trying to assess the consequences of this programme for phonology itself, it would be instructive to identify four major ideas or principles that have characterised work in the Montague tradition, out of which constraint-based grammar formalisms have grown. The first is THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITION-ALITY, which requires that the form and interpretation of an expression be a function of the form and interpretation of its parts. This principle motivated Bach's well-known RULE-TO-RULE HYPOTItESIS, requiring that the linguistic modules (such as syntax, semantics and phonology) be organised in parallel rather than in series, where the output of one module is the input of the next. The second principle is Partee's (1979, 276) WELL-FORMEDNESS CONSTRAINT, which states that well-formed expressions are buih up out of well-formed parts. An immediate consequence of this is that there can be no phonological 'repair strategies' which operate on ill-formed structures. A third principle goes by the linked terms INTENSION-ALITY and PARTIALITY. The idea here is that there is a distinction to be drawn between linguistic descriptions and the objects they describe (such as pieces of speech). Descriptions can only ever be partial, in the sense that they pick out---or DENOTE----classes of objects rather than individual objects. For example, in a given language, [+voice] denotes a class of speech sounds, [+nasal] denotes another class, and [+voice,+nasal] denotes the intersection of these two","2Historical note: There is a close parallel between this theoretical position and that adopted by Th~o Venneman, Joan Hooper and Grover Hudson in the 70's in the theoretical framework known as Natural Generative Phonology (Hooper, 1976). More recently, Bach (1983) and Wheeler (1981) have independently adopted a similar stance regarding the incorporation of phonology into categorial grammar.

The final principle is TIlE LF2OCALIST tP/POTIIESIS as expounded in its strong form by Bresnan and others, which has lead to the lexicalisation of linguistic information and the corresponding simplification of phrase structure roles. From these themes come such requirements that there be no extrinsic rule ordering, no 'feature-changing', no intermediate levels of representation, and so on; all of them principles that many phonologists have independently come to embrace. The ultimate implications of this perspective for phonology is the removal of the role-representation distinction in favour of the description-object distinction 4. Grammar formalisms like IIPSG also lack the rule-representation distinction. For exanlple, (1 a) is described by Pollard & Sag (1987, 149) as a role. However, they also provide an equivalent statement of the rule in the more conventional 'rewrite' notation (lb). (1) a. [it~t>1n RIsYNlUx:ItJaX -"]},{"title":"mrs [COMe-DTRS ([l)","paragraphs":["b.

It is shown how various interactions between phonology and the other modules of grammar can be studied within the context of [IPSG. Section 2 presents the finite-state model of phonology advanced by Bird & Ellison (1992). This is followed by a section on a phonology-morphology interaction (nasalisation in TerSna) and a section on a phonology-syntax interaction (complex NP shift). The paper concludes with a discussion of the shortcomings and future prospects of this work. 2 Finite-State Phonology Over the last decade much has been written on the application of finite-state transducers (FSTs) to phonol-","~This modelqheoretic viewpoint is explored in detail by Bird (1990). A first-order language, similar to Johnson's (1988) attribute-value language, is presented in which both phonological Stnletures and feature structures can be expressed. Bird & Klein (1990, 53), Pierrehumbert (1990, 392) and Ilird & Ladd (1991, 206-7) discuss some ramifications of this view of phonology.","4This new view of phonology has been investigated by Bird (t 990), Coleman (1991).

The two-level formalism is an attractive computational model for 1960's generative phonology. However, as has \"already been noted, phonologists have since moved away from complex string rewriting systems to a range of so-called nmflinear models of phonology. The central innovation of this more recent work is the idea that phonological representations are not strings of characters but collections of strings, synchmnised like an orchestral score. There have been some notable recent attempts to rescue the FST model from its linearity in order to encompass nonlinear phonology (Kay, 1987; Koroai, 1991). llowever, if a fundamental shift in perspective in phonology has indeed occurred, then these refinements to the FST model do not go far enough. We require a further restriction that a transducer can only add information: the set of symbols accepted on a particular cell of the 'surface' tape must be a sub-set of the set accepted on the corresponding cell of the 'lexical' tape. An I;ST so constrained is actually nothing more than a finite-state automaton"]},{"title":"(FSA).","paragraphs":["Consequently, FSAs would now seem to be more appropriate than FSTs for doing phonology, so long as it is possible to come up with some way of encoding nonlinear phonology using FSAs. In fact, this has been done by Bird & Ellison (1992), who have shown how autosegmental TIF.RS, ASSOCIATIONS and RULES can be encompassed by FSAs. The central idea is that each tier is a partial description of a string, and tiers are put together using the intersection operation (vI) defined on FSAs. Apart from being truer to current phonological the-orizing, this one-level model has a second important advantage over the two-level model. Since the set of FSAs fomls a boolemt lattice under intersection, union and complement, we can safely conjoin ('unify'), disjoin and negate phonological descriptions. Such a framework is obviously compatible with constraint-based grammar fomudisms. As it happens, tim currant usage of phonology in I1PSG is just a simple form of finite-state phonology of the kind elatx~rated here.","As our lirst example, consider the phenomenon of homorganic nasal assimilation, wherehy nasals agree in place-of-articulation with the following consonant.

The second (LP2) states that the ordering of complements respects the obliqueness hierarchy. LP2 is repeated below; the symbol '<<' is the obliqueness ordering carried over into phonology (Pollard & Sag, 1987, 174).","FOCUS is clearly not the only factor involved in complex NP shift.

The frmnework starts where HPSG left off, in the sense that ]IPSG's phonology attribute-- a list--can be viewed as a subclass of automata. The framework is potentially far-reaching in the sen~ that it encompasses non-linear phonology (Bird & Ellison, 1992). Although this work is preliminary, it is alleady clear how several standard phonological devices may be recast in this new framework. For exanrple, the traditional distinction between morphophonology and phonology proper and the distinction between lexical and post-lexical phonology can be modelled in terms of the distinction between lexical and prosodic hierarchies. The traditional prosodic domains (phrase, foot, syllable) are recast as types, and domain-bounded processes are regular expressions tied to the required prosodic type.","One area of morphophonology that has not been touched on here is the situation where the selection of an allomorph is sensitive to the phonological context.

Another area for i'urther work is to investigate interactions between phonology and semantics. For example, it is often observed that there is a close correspondence between intonational phrases and a particular semantic cluster called a sense unit, whereby any stretch of material that correspol:tds to an intonational phrase must also qualify as a sense unit (Bird, 1991b). Previous accounts of this phenomenon have required the mediation of a syntactic module and this has lead to an extra level of complexity (e.g. Selkirk (1984, 290-296)). Now there is the exciting prospect of being able to explore phonology-semantics interactions directly. For example, given suitable definitions, we could simply writc: PIIRASE ~- SI,'.NSE-UNIT. It is hoped that further work in this vein will lead to a nonlinear model of phonology that is fully integrated into constraint-based grammar formalisms. This will open the way for applications of such frameworks to a much wider range of the world's languages. Aeries DF. COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 7 9 PRoc. ov COLING-92.
