The core idea of such a description of ordering is constituted by creating a type lattice for lists. The possibilities of expressing different approaches to word order in the framework are briefly discussed, exemplified and compared to other methods.","In the standard immediate-constituent based approaches, the \"free\" word order I is described either directly in the phrase-structure (PS) rules, which thus express simultaneously both dominance (mother/daughter) relations and precedence (ordering) relations between syntactic categories, or, in more recent formalisms such as GPSG or HPSG, by the linear precedence (LP) rules creating a separate component of the grammar, whose other component is the set of immediate-dominance (ID) rules. In both these cases, the ordering constraints are limited to sister constituents, i.e. they are strictly local.","One of the problems of both these variations of the standard PS-approach is the description of adjuncts (free modifiers). On the usual assumption that their number per clause is in principle not limited (though finite for a particular clause), an approach to their ordering presuppos-ing them to be all sister constituents laust necessarily presuppose also an (at least potentially) infinite set of generative rules (e.g., a set induced by a Kleene star used in a \"basic\" variant of one of the rules).","In languages whose grammar allows for more word order freedom than English 2, it is often the case that adjuncts and complements of a head (typically, but not solely, of a finite verb) can be freely intermixed, which makes the approach where the locality of LP constraints forces the head as well as its modifiers (both complements and adjuncts) be expanded as sisters still less attractive.","Another possibility of description of word order is the \"topological\" approach used predominantly in more traditionally oriented German linguistics. Applied to German, this approach divides a clause into several word order \"fields\" (\"Vorfeld\", \"Mittelfeld\", \"Nachfeld\", \"linke/rechte Satzklammer\") whose mutual position is fixed, and studies mainly the word order regularities within these \"fields\". Though a lot of work has been done and many valuable insights presented within this paradigm, seen from the viewpoint of computational linguistics this approach has the fatal disadvantage that it is extremely difficult to formalize within the standard frameworks (e.g., none of the \"fields\" with the possible exception of \"Vorfeld\" creates a constituent in any usual sense etc.).","AS an alternative to the two basic approaches mentioned above (as a modification of the first one, in fact), the description based on binary right-branching structures has been proposed independently in several works concerned with languages ex-Aca~s DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~'T 1992 1 8 4 PROC.

However, the price paid for the removal of some problems, mainly, the free intermixing of heads, complements and adjuncts, of the abovementioned more standard descriptions is rather high - at least two problematic points arise due to the strict binarity of the structure. The first of them is the fact that in binary structures no LP-rules relying on the relation \"being sister constituent\" can be used for ordering heads, complements and adjuncts in cases this is required, since these are not sisters any more. The second problematic point can be seen at best at the variant of the formalism given in (Avgustinova and Oliva, 1990) the occurrence of the phonologically empty rightmost element of the branching 3 (cf. the structure (1) for the string \"John kissed Mary yesterday\")."]},{"title":"6","paragraphs":["The former problem concerning word order is in the majority of the binary-branching approaches (as far as they are at all concerned with it) solved by introducing word order mechanisms which are either of non-local nature or which burden the syntactic categories (understood as feature bundles) with otherwise unmotivated features used solely for the purpose of imposing ordering constraints (and most often, with a combination of the two). Neither approach is more fortunate than the other - nonulocality is surely an unwished phenomenon in the description, and the presence of special ordering features in the categories is hardly better, i.a. also because order is a property of the syntactic structure (made of categories) rather than of the categories themselves 4 .","This paper will try to show that in spite of the abovementioned reservations the \"binary branching\" can be a correct and fruitful approach to syntactic description if seen from a slightly different viewpoint. In order to get the proper perspective, let us observe the \"binary branching\" structure for the example sentence \"The small boy ate an apple\" shown in (2) .","There are several things to be taken into consideration here.","The most obvious among them is the division of the structure into \"levels\" - contiguous sequences.of nodes with identical marking.

Introduction of more fine-grained subtypes may be needed also for the final element of a list (usually n£1); the respective subtypes should mirror the kinds of phrases used as functions of the \"levels\" of the syntactic structure, giving thus rise, e.g., to types end ofnp, end ofvp etc.","[]sing a different form of structural representation enforces also using different form (but not different background intuitions) of rules and principles of the grammar, all of them corresponding tothe types of lists as introduced in the immediately preced-ing text.","Thus, the Head Feature Principle (HFP) is to be expressed as a conjunction of two implications 7 (rather than a single implication, combining conjunctively with other principles of the grammar), one describing the case where the first element of the respective nonempty 8 list is the head of the respective phrase (\"level\"), the other one describing the rest of the cases.

For more details see (Oliva, 1992).","The principal achievement of the approach presented is the (re)introduction of locality into binary branching structures allowing for replacing the more standard but in this case unsuitable concept of ordering constraints holding for sister constituents by a very similar concept of ordering constraints holding for a list of constituents. However, the in-troduction of lists allows also for easiness of expressing different other techniques of describing word order arld its variations, such as the \"topological\" approach discussed above 12 or the \"systemic ordering\" as worked out by Prague linguists (e.g., Sgall et ai.,1986) etc. Worth consideration is also the relation of this approach based on typing of lists of surface constituents (expressing thus i.a. also their obliqueness hierarchy) to the \"<<\"-type of LP-rules of the standard HPSG, which, unlike the approach discussed, force obliqueness of complements to be expressed repeatedly within the subcategorization list of each head.","The applicability of tile method of description of word order as discussed in this paper has been proved by using it successfully in an experimental grammar of German developed in the STUF '91 forlaalism within the i£Log project.

This convention will be used consequently and should not, thus, cause n~sunderstanding. Both types and sorts create their respective lattices, in principle independent from each other. This allows for using operators &, v and not for creating unification, disjunction and complement, respectively, of types and sorts. In the following examples, types will be given as attribute-value matrices enclosed in square brackets, and sorts as subscripts in italics of these brackets. 7 Reme~r that the principle in the form of an implication applies only if the left-hand side of the implication unifies with the structure the principle should apply on; note also that in the particular case formulated here, the HFP could have been simplified into a conjunction of a non-implication and an implication parts. 8 No form of HFP applies on the empty list","no inheritance of features between mother and head daughter can occur there, obviously. 9 Notwithstanding the particularization (four implications instead of one in standard HPSG), this still should be treated as a principle - it is a generalization holding across kinds of phrases (NP's, irP's etc.). i0 Typically, but not necessarily, concatenation. iI Two short remarks seem to be needed on this spot. First, here the fact that in German the clause cannot be constituted by a finite verb alone, is to be coped in other parts of the grantmar (e.g., by the subcategorization of the verb). Second, the fact that no afterfield is allowed in verb-last clauses in this example is an arbitrary decision, having little to do with the general expressive power of the presented approach, and even less with grammar of \"real\" German. 12 Of particular importance on this spot seem to be the facts that on the approach sketched it is naturally possible to speak about, e.g., the middlefiel d, giving to this term also a clear-cut formalized treatment bot without forcing it to occur as a true constituent in the description, as well as the possibility to specify the position of the verb in verb-first and verb-second German clauses without retorting to any kind of \"movement\" mechanism (e.g., to SLASH).
