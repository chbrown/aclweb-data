This paper presents results of tile LEXlC projecO, which was set up to prepare the development of large multilingual lexieal resources. Kt;ywords: lexicons, tools, large-scale resources, typed feature structures. 1 Introduction 1.1 Common Linguistic Resources A large amount of the investments in the development of any NLP application is spent on the construction of what one might call \"large databases of lexieal and grammatical resources\". These resources could in principle he useful for many applications although they hardly ever are: due to the lack of agreement on the definition of basic notions and of consensus on the analysis of linguistic phenomena they are often linked too closely to specific applications. Moreover, given the generally limited size and duration of NLP projects both quantity and quality of such project-specific databases are disappointing. In this paper we will discuss results from the LExlc project, a feasibility study preparing large-scale develop-","1The Lexic project wan financed and supported by the three project partners: Philips Research, developing tile Rosetta machine translation system, the Foundation for Language Technology, participating in tile Eurotra project, and Van Dale, one of the lnaln dictionary publishers in the Netherlands, as well as by tile the European Commission, and the l)utch ministries of Education and l\"coaomic Affairs.

The lexica[ database is designed to consist of an integrated package of two monolingual dictionaries for I)utch and Spaaish and the bilingual dictionaries relating the~ languages. The consortium comprised a dictionary publisher as well as NLP application developers, giving it the unique opportunity of confronting the large body of exl)erience, infrastructure and existing data of publishers with the requirements of a new class of profe~qional users. Another interesting aspect of the projcct was that it addressed the whole spectrum of issues in lexieal database development, from lexical acquisition to serving heterogeneous client applications. In the current absence of arty standard for tile (grammatical) content of the dictionary (e.g. standardized sets of grammaticM features) the reusability of a dictionary can only be evaluated in terms of usability for some target applications. 1.2 Structure of the paper Section 2 discusses the issue of acquisition of lexical data. Section 3 introduces the implementation formalism and tools. The lexicon architecture is discussed in section 4. Conversion of data to client applications of the database is discussed in section 5. 2 Acquisition 2.1 Strategies There are three potentially useful strategies to develop large lexical resources, which are not ill principle mutually exclusive. MRDs The extraction of data from machine-readable dictionaries has received nmch attention ill the past decade. In our view tile usefulness of existing material for NLP application has been somewhat overestimated. Traditional dictionaries are oriented towards a market of hlll/lau constlu3ers~ who coustllt the dictionary for entirely different reasons than N LP applications. For instance, most of the information in NhP dictio. uaries is concerned with the grammatical description of Ac:rf!s DI!

Furthermore, given that humans can use their intelligence and knowledge of the language(s), much information is only present in unformalized definitions and examples. As discussed in e.g. [MeNaught, 1988], it is often feasible to extract (relatively) formalized information, but the cost-effectiveness of autmnatic extraction of information from less formalized data is highly questionable. From this discussion it follows that MRDs"]},{"title":"atone","paragraphs":["cannot be the source for NLP dictionaries. In section 2.2 we will discuss in more detail the evaluation of the potential sources of data for our specific purposes. Corpora Automatic extraction of lexical features by applying various pattern recognition techniques to large bodies of text has received some attention recently (cf. e.g. [Zernik and Jaeobs, 1990]). tlowever, the information needed for our applications cannot be extracted from corpora yet, although important improvements can bc expected in the following years. Lexicography Given the present inadequacy of MRDs and corpus-related tools, manual labour is indispensable for lexicon development. The tools described in section 3 have been developed as a 'workbench' to support these lexieographical activities. We will show that this tool allows for easy integration of information extracted from MRDs with lexicographic editing. 2.2 Sources Evaluation Measure It is difficult to assess the \"reusability\" of existing data without an evaluation mea~ snre, i.e. without knowing"]},{"title":".for what purpose","paragraphs":["the data shonld be usable.

Eventually, all lexical entries in the two languages should be described using this scheme, so that they can be readily converted to client applications. The data that can be extracted from a potential source has been interpreted with respect to this classification scheme to assess the amount of information contained in it. Data Analysis The machine-readable sources we considcred are the existing Van Dale Dutch monolingual and bilingual Dutch-Spanish machine-readable dictionary and the CELEX lexical database. From our evaluation it followed that existing MRDs for Dutch (as for almost all other languages) contain only a small part of the information needed by NLP applications.","~Well-structured dictionaries like [Longman, 1987] are an important exception to this, cf. [Boguraev and Briscoe, t989], Fortunately, the CELEX lexical database has enriched a selection of 30000 entries of the \"Van Dale Dictionary of Contemporary Dutch\" with grammatical information, taking into account the requirements of a number of (prototype) NLP applications under development in the Netherlands. A large amount of information needed for our target applications can be converted automatically from this database. The entries, stored in a relational database, can be imported into the Dutch lexicon using the TFS constraint solver similarly to the conversion to client applications (see section 5). The Cr.gx dictionary has historic links to tile Van Dale dictionaries (especially with respect to reading distinction), which greatly simplifies integration of these sources. With respect to translation information we found that the \"raw\" translational data could be extracted easily from the Vail Dale bilingual dictionaries. The original Vail Dale concept is especially interesting for multilingum applications, as the Dutch part is the same (at least in principle) in all bilingual dictionaries with Dutch as source language (cf. [van Sterkenburg"]},{"title":"el al.,","paragraphs":["1982]). Extraction of information about phrasal translation, such as the choice of the support verb of a noun in the target language, is unfortunately hidden in unrestricted text (example sentences etc.), from which it is difficult to extract.

Our prototype is implemented on top of Sicstus Prolog, and is used primarily for selection and conversion of data. It offers a number of tracing and debugging facilities to assist in the design of type-hierarchies and during query-evaluation. These three tools can import and export data in a special-pnrpo~ text format, whictl is useful for interchange and further processing. The acquisition tools for the Van Dale dictionaries and Celex can also generate their output in this format. 3.1 User Interface The hierarchical definition of the grammatical types in TFS corresponds closely to a \"decision tree\" which the lexicographer traverses while editing a lemma. A graph~ teal user interface has been developed by the computer science department of the State University of Utrecht ([Fokker, 1992]) which allows the user to narrow down the main type of the lenrma (s)he is editing to a specific subtype and to subsequently edit the associated feature structure.

OF COI.ING 92, NAN-rEs, AU(I. 23-28, 1992 The relation between word forms aml canonical forms is many-to-many: ortimgrapllic variants are mapped onto a single canonical form, and a single word form call be related to ~veral lexical entries via inflectional rule* s. The monolingual dictionary is a net of lexical entries, which are pairings of canonical word forms of a language and their designations, and in addition describe their grarnrnatical properties. As a result, a lexical entry dmuld minimally have the two features canonical~form and semantics. The former feature has the simple type STRIM6, the latter, the description of the designation, has a complex value, po&'fibly including ~nrantic features, but minimally contain-ing an identifying feature v, as we want to make sure it will always be possihle to interconnect tile monolingnal dictionaries via bilingual dictionaries. Apart from these two features, there will he other features for the d~criplion of the grammatical properties of the word. The combination of canonicalJ'orm and grammatical description should allow for the complete and correct generation of all word forms and their a.,mociated feature strnctures. As our intended client applications have front ends for this purpose the database was not designed to be a full form dictionary; tiffs could change, depending on the needs of future client applications. The ~t of designations can be viewed as a thesaurus or \"knowledge base\"; the lexical entries are \"pointers\" from words into this knowledge base, and can be implemented as sudl in TFS. The relation between canonical word forms and designations is also many-to-many, due to synonymy (several word forms related to the same designation) and lexical ambigality (one word form related to several designations). In addition to this there will be alternations in the description because of alternative grammatical patterns. These alternations are implemented as TFS disjunctions. 4.2 The bilingual dictionary Bilingual dictionaries can be viewed as a relation between words in two languages. The levels \"word form\", \"lexical entry\" and \"reading\" correspond to various degrees of granularity in bilingual dictionaries. Ideally, the bilingnal dictionary relates lexical items between languages at the level of readings, though in practice most existing dictionaries refer to canonical forms or even to word forum in the target language. Furthermore, the source language side in bilingual dictionaries usually refers to readings different from the monolingually motivated ones, because they are tuned to tile target language: two readings are not distinguished if they translate to the same word, or an additional reading is created for an additional translation. An exception is the original concept of the bilingual Van Dale dictionaries, where the source language reading structure of the bilingual","6g.g. the Dutch word form bekcnd is associated with the adjective bekcnd (meaning well-known)and (by participle for-mation) to the verb bekennen (to conJess).","r'I'he name of t, tored semantic substructures in the TI:S database serves this purpose. dictionaries is hased directly on the moaolingual reading structure (of, [van Sterkenhurg ef at., 1982]). An interesting approach to the hilingual dictionary would be to view it ~.s describing pairings of bilingual synonyms. Tile advantage of this would be that 1. the dictionary supl)orts preservation of meaning in","translation. 2. formal properties of equivalence relations (e.g. tran-","sitive closure) can be exploited to automatically ex-","paml the dictionary. 3. coding efforts call be reduced: tile detinition of the","designation can be shared between monolingual and","bilingual synonyms. Tile main difference hetween traditional dictionaries and our approach is therefore that tile indirect translational description of hilmgual synonymy is replaced by a direct relation between lexical entries in the nmnolingual dictionaries to all independent \"knowledge hase\" of synonym clusters. This approach is conamon ill e.g. multilingual terminology (cf. [Picht and 1)raskau, 1985]), but less common in lexicology. We will show that the two representations can be translated into each other. Section 4.3 describes how a knowledge base is generated from monolingual and bilingual dictionaries. A bilingual dictionary can be generated automatically from a set of monolingual dictionaries and a klmwledge base by enumerating the pairs of lexical entries in two monolingual dictionaries pointing to the same synonym cluster. 4.3 Gcneratlng Synonym Clusters Existing machine-readable trilingual dictionaries s can be converted to a representation based on bilingual synonymy, by \"extracting\" the underlying concepts. The process consists of tile following steps: First, the dictionaries are parsed and transformed to a table synoaym of the relation between a reading Rz in a language LZ and a reading R2 in L=. Two versions of this program have been developed and tested: one for the Van Dale Dutch-Spanish dictionary and one for bilingual entries in the EUROTRA transfer rule format. A version for dictionaries in a standard interchange format would be a possible future extension. Second, reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure is applied to the synonyM/4 relation s. For each reading the generated synonym cluster can be viewed. E.g. according to tile Van Dale Dutch-Spanish dictionary, reading 0.1 of Dutch eerbetoon (English Onark of) honour) has one synonymous reading in Dutch and three synonyms in Spanish. eerbetoon O. 1 :","SActually, there is no restriction to it b=lingual dk'tionary: severe.l bi- or multilinguM dictionaries, and even monolingual diction;tries of synonyms, can be processed similarly, result-ing in a mulldingual dictionary.

The program couhl of course be modified to ~Lse the grummatical information about the target word in tbc dictionary as reading distinguisher; the noun fresco would then never be confimed with the adjective. This is ullde~iral)le ill l)rincil)lc, bowcver, at; we do not WKllt syntactic criteria to guide readiug distinction, l\"or in stance, many adjectives in I~x)mance languages have he mol)honous uominal counterparts, with identical morphology and ~manties. We don't want to be forced a priori to distinguish separate readings for the~e two cases. Furthermore, well-known examples of category shift iu translation re.g. adverbs translating to verbs etc.) show it is impossible to attach a unique syntactic category to an equivalence class. These presentations of synonym clusters can be very helpful to interaetively improve transfer dictionaries: errors of this type can easily he detected by native speakers of the languages (who need not know the other language) and corrected by creating appropriate reading distinction in Spanish. We cbecked the quality of tbe synonym clusters gener. ated from from both Van Dale and a EUItO'rRA Spanish Dutch dictionary. The Eurotra dictionary, where both source and target language items are referred to at the reading level, was converted to over 2187 chtsters, 315 of whicb contained more than one Spanish reading. Native speakers agreed with more than 95% of these synonym sets gcuerated via the bilingual elomlre step. The interpretation of bilingual translation as synonymy is therefore correct in the vast majority of eases. llowever, exceptions exist, such as tbe translation of the Spanish reloj, which, even though a true (aud infre quest) l)utch synonym exists (viz. uurwerk (el. English limepiece)), more commolfiy trauslate~ to one of its hypouyn~ besiege (Eng watch) or klok (Eng clock). An interesting e[ahoration of our approach would be to extend the k*mwledge base by ordering the synouym clusters themselves via hypono,ny It (cf. [Cruse, 1986], l°'l'he problem of c'annecting word forms to their readings ha* lu'en called the mappin 9 t~roblem. Gf.

Our &pproadl extends this idea by adding a multilin gtlaJ dimension. Wordset's sylloltym t~tt~ are ~.lsO related by relations with leas oh:as translational contu:qu(mt:cn. [Lyous, 1977]). Client applications could then extract Irauslati(mal data based not only on synonymy but also on hyp(er)onymy. However. this is a dillicult area, where no obvious solutions exist. It is not clear at all which translatiou solution automatic translators should select in c~mes like this anyway. After thls correction process the synonyln clnsters can be couverted to TFS format and stored in the database, The a.~sociated monolingunl dictk)nnries are then modi fled automatically by adding cross-reference informatiott (via the feature se mastics) from the lcxicnl entries to the synonym dustcrs they use a~uociated with. 4.4 Creating a knowledge I)ase. Synonym clusters reMly become descriptions of designations once semautlc information is added to the syn onym dusters, which is then, in a truly interlingual way, shared between synonyms. Much mmlaxltic information froul the (~ELEX 1)utch dictionary can I>e moved to the synonym clusters, as well as Van Dale defiuitious of concepts in natural language. Tbc latter arc useful for semiautomntic interactive applications Is. The current approach can be said to inlpiement the apo proach of possible bilingual lexlcal translalioa, Tiffs al> preach should he developed in a uumber of ways. Apart from the problem of translation to non-synouyms we mentioned, it is desirable to inchLde information in the dictionary to guide the choice among possible transla-tions, iu cases where there are several syuonyms in the target language. Stylistic, eolloeational and frequency infl)rmation can be of use for this purpose. This infer motion is partly available from existing sources (sucb as CF, I,EX attd Van Dale), and large text corpora are also obviously relevant sources of this information. 5 A model for conversion Conversion or exchange of lexical data presupposes a detailed comparison of the various dictiouaries, which in turn requires a careful description of the various dictionaries. Given the purpose of Comparison, the descriptions shouM be cast in a uniform, preferably high-level data descriptiou lauguage. Several such languages exist, such as the Entity- Relationship model, a tool in database design. We will use the TFS formalism introduced in ~ction 3 for this purpose. A lirst step in tiffs comparison is to convcrt various dictionaries to the uniforln TFS format. In [n~xqt NI,P for-malisms lexical entries are records or feature structures, so this syntactic transformation is generally unproblematic.

This type serves both as documentation of the dictionary and as conversion specification.","A conversion specification is a TFS type CONVERT hav-ing features for each of the dictionaries (e.g. lezic, eurotra and rosetta), and establishes the basic conversion relation between entries in the LEXIC dictionary (as derived from the sources and augmented by lexicographers) and entries in the EtrROTRA and ROSETTA dictionaries. This conversion type is structured hierarchically as well: the high-level type CONVERT has many subtypes specify-ing how specific subtypes (and hence subsets of the respective lexicons) of the various dictionaries are related. Disjuncts in the constraints of these types enumerate corresponding patterns described as feature structures. An advantage is that these conversion constraints can be defined at the appropriate level of abstraction. It is in principle possible to establish relations holding for all entries as well as for an individual entry. As the conversion types are also ordered in an inheritance hierarchy, subtypes will inherit the constraints of their supertype(s). Note the inherent declarative character of the conversion constraints: there is no notion of 'input' and 'output'. One advantage of this is that a single formalism can be nsed for importation, generation as well as integration of lexicons. A second advantage is that the conversion constraints can also be used to test whethcr two existing dictionaries are related as postulated in the conversion constraints. Full derivability of a particular dictionary can be viewed as a special case of the general (in principle relational) scheme, where the substructure of a feature like rosetta is fully (and functionally) derivable from the substructure of another (lezic). Informally, all primitive distinctions in the target dictionary can be computed given the information in the source dictionary, i.e. the constraints define a homomorphism from the serving dictionary to the client application. It is an empirical issue whether this derivability relation can actually he defined between two dictionaries. For newly to be created \"generic\" lexicons, this derivability is a design requirement. For the client dictionaries we have had to look at, creation of a generic source appeared to be a complex, but feasible, task. Operationally, conversion proceeds as query-evaluation. Givcn an appropriate dcfinition of the CONVERT type, the solutions to the following query will find all lexieal entries whose canonical form is tiers in the LExIc database and return all corresponding further instantiations of the ROSETrA type. These instantiations correspond to the I~.OSETTA descriptions for this lexical entry."]},{"title":"Ic°'\"'i","paragraphs":["ENTRY lexic : canonical_form :fiets rosetta : ROSETTA 6 Illustration We will illustrate conversion using the example in [van der Eijk, 1992a] relating two familiar linguistic theories, GPSG and a unification variant of Categoria] Grammar, rather than the LEXIC fragment and ROSETTA, which we actually implemented. The categorial lexical entries have a feature subcat whose value is either a CATEGORY or a FUNCTION. The type FUNCTION has appropriate features argument, (with two features direction and category), and result, where the result can be either a function again or a CATEGORY. Individual Icxical entries are simply instances of this highly general recursive scheme. E.g. the subcat feature of a transitive verb (i.e. (NP\\S)/NP) has type FUNCTION, with an NP argument to the right and, recursively, a FUNCTION from a subject NP to an S as result. In GPSG individual lexical entries also have a feature subcat, but its value, an intcgcr, is used to select the corresponding context-free grammar rule for this complcmentation pattern. One of the disjuncts of the constrain ts for the CONVERT type will then be the following.

Tile actual notation for conversion rules allows for embedded disjunctions and is, hence, much more concise. AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAr,'fES, 23-28 AOI~T 1992 5 8 Pltoc.

The TFS formalism is very appropriate for the design and implementation of NLP lexicons. We showed that its hierarchical structure can be n~d profitably in a data entry tool which allows the lexicographer to manipulate feature structures graphically. Lexical acquisition from existing lexical resources can be combined seamlessly with lexicographie work. The lexicon architecture we designed is an important improvement over earlier approaches: various abstrac-tion levels and the mappings between them are defined more precisely, and the modularity is increased significantly by the ~paration of the knowledge base from language-specific dictionaries.
