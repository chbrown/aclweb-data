In TDMT, transfer knowledge is the central knowledge of translation, and various kinds aml levels of knowledge are cooperatively applied to input sentences. TDMT effectively utilizes an example-based framework for transfer and analysis knowledge. A consistent framework of examples makes the cooperation between transfer and analysis effective, and efficient translation is achieved. The TDMT prototype system, which translates Japanese spoken dialogs into English, has shown great promise. 1 Introduction Many applications dealing with spoken-language, such as automatic telephone interpreting system, need efficient and robust processing. The system must be capable of handling many idiomatic expressions and spoken-language-specific expressions which deviate from conventional grammar. Also, spoken-hmguage has both easy and difficult expressions to translate. In human translation when translating an easy sentence, tile translated result is produced quickly using only surface-level knowledge. When translating a complex sentence, a more elaborate process is performed, using syntactic, semantic, and contextual knowledge. Thus, many strategies and various levels of knowledge are used to effectively translate spoken-language. This paper proposes a method called Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT), which carries out efficient translation processing by driving the necessary translation processes according to the nature of the input sentence. An example-based framework can achieve quick processing and consistently describe knowledge. The integration of transfer and analysis in an example-based framework is i)roposed as a method for achieving TDMT. In this method, transfer and analysis proceed autonomously and cooperatively. Also, a well-balanced load on each process can be achieved by employing this integrated processing mechanism. Sectiou 2 explains the idea of TDMT. Section 3 explains distance calculation and transfer in an example-based framework. Section 4 explains analysis in an example-based framework. Section 5 reports on the TDMT prototype system, and Section 6 reports on tile experimental results. The explanations in the following sections use Japanese-to-English translation."]},{"title":"2 Transfer-Driven Machine Translation","paragraphs":["TD/vlT performs efficient and robust spoken-language translation using various kinds of strategies to be able to treat diverse input.

In TDMT, transfer knowledge consists of various levels of bilingual information. It is the primary knowledge used to solve translation problems. The transfer module retrieves the necess~u-y transfer knowledge ranging from global unit like sentence structures to local unit like words. The retrieval and application of transfer knowledge are flexibly controlled depending on the knowledge necessary to translate the input. Basically, translation is performed by using transfer knowledge. A transfer module utilizes analysis knowledge (syntactic/szmantic infonnation) which helps to apply transfer L,~owledge to some part of the input. And generation and context knowledge are utilized for producing correct translatiou result. In other words, TDMT prodaces translation results by utilizing these dift'cK,~ut kinds of knowledge cooperatively and by centering on transfer, and achieves efficient translation according to the nature of the input.

Most of the transfer knowledge in TDMT is described by the example-based framework. An example-based framework is useful for cortsistenfly describing transfer knowledge. The essence of the example-based framework is the distance calculation. This framework achieves the best-match based on the distance between the input and provided examples, and selects the most plausible target expression from many candidates. The distance is calculated quickly because of its simple mechanism. Through providing examples, various kinds and levels of knowledge can be described in the example-based franlework. 2.3 Multi-level knowledge TDMT provides multi-level transfer knowledge, which correspoods to each translation strategy. In the transfer knowledge of the TDMT prototype system, there is string-, pattern- and grammar-level knowledge. TDMT achieves efficient translation by utilizing multi-level knowledge effectively according to the nature of input. Some conventional machine translation systems also provide multiple levels of transfer knowledge for idioms, syntax, semantics, and so on, and try to apply these levels of that knowledge in a fixed order to cover diverse input [Ikehara et al. 87]. However, this method proceeds with the analysis lot deciding which level of knowledge should be applied for any given input sentence in a fixed order, placing heavy load on the analysis module. Also, the knowledge description is ratber more complicated than that of the example-based framework. Therefore, the lrauslation of a simple sentence is not always quick because the system tries to cover all translation strategies. 3 Example-based Transfer TDMT utilizes distance calculation to determine the most plausible target expression and structure in transfer. 3.1 Word distance We adopt the distance calculation method of Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) [Sumita and lida 91]. The distance between words is defined as the closeness of semantic attributes in a thesaurus. Words have certain thesaurus codes, which correspond to particular semantic attributes. The distance between the semantic attributes is determined according to the relationship of their positions in the hierarchy of the thesaurus, and varies between 0 and 1 (Fig. 1). The distance between semantic attributes A and B is expressed as d(A, B). Provided that the words X and Y have the semantic attribute A and B, respectively, the distance between X and Y, d(X, Y), is equal to d(A, B)."]},{"title":"d(A,D~ Figure 1 Distance between thesaurus codes","paragraphs":["The hierarchy of the thesaurus that we use is in accordance with the thesaurus of everyday Japanese [Ohno and Hamanishi 84], and consists of four layers. when two values can be abstracted in the k-th layer from the bottom, the distance k/3 (0 -< k _< 3) is assigned. The value 0 means that two codes belong to exactly the same category, and 1 means that they are unrelated. The attributes \"writing\" and \"book\" are abstracted by the immediate upper attribute \"document\" and the distance is given as 1/3. Thus, the word \"ronbun{technical paper}\" which has thesaurus code \"writing\", and \"yokoushuu{proceedings}\" which has the thesaurus code \"book\", are assigned a distance of 1/3. 3.2 Description of Transfer Knowledge Transfer knowledge describes the correspondence between source language expressions (SE) and target language expressions (TE) in certain meaningful units, preserving the translational equivalence [Tsujii and Fujila 91]. The condition under which a TE is chosen as a translation result of an SE is associated with the TE. Transfer knowledge in an example-based framework is described as follows: SE => TEl (Ell, E12,...), TEn (Enl, En2,...) Each TE has several examples as conditions. Eij means the j-th example of TEi. The input is the SE's environment, and the most appropriate TE is selected according to the calculated distance between the input and the examples. The input and examples comprise a set of words. Let us suppose that an input I and each example Eij consist of t elements as follows: Au~s DE COIANG-92, NANTES, 23-28 ôtn\" 1992 6 4 6 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 I : (I1,...,It) Eij = (Eijl,...,Eijt) Then the distance between I and Eij is calculated as follows:","d (I, Eij) = d ((I1,...,It), (Eijl,...,Eijt)) t = Z d (Ik, Eijk)*Wk k=l The attribute weight Wk expresses fire importance of the k-th element in the translation 1. The distance from the input is calculated for all examples. Then the example whose distance to the input is least, is detected and the TE which has the example is selected. When Eij is close,st to I, TEl is selected as file most plausible TE. The enrichment of examples increases the accuracy of determining the TE because conditions become more detailed. Further, even if there is only one TE, but there is no example close to the input, the application of the tc, msfer knowledge is rejected. 3.3 Wide application of distance calculation Distance calculation is usexl to deternfine which TE has the example that is clo~st to the input, ,'rod can be used in various abstract level expressions tlepending on how the input words are provided. Various levels of knowledge can be provided by the wide application of distance calculation. TDMT achieves efficient translation by utilizing multi-level knowledge effectively. In the transfer knowledge of Ihe TDMT prototype system, the string-, pattern- and grammar-level knowledge, the latter two of which can be described easily in an example-based framework, are now adopted. String-level knowledge is the most concrete, while grammar-level knowledge is fire most abstract. 3.3.1 String-level transfer knowledge Since this kind of knowledge has a condition outside the SE, the cooperation with such as context module is sometimes necessary. In some cases rite conditions can be dcseribed by the examples of the most closely related word in which the SE is used, as follows:","sochira => this ((des'u {be}2)...), you ((okuru {send})..), it ((mira {see})...) 1 Wk is given for each lk by TE's distribution that sematic attribute of Ik brings [Sumita and lida 91]. 2 { w l'\"\"Wn } is the list of corresponding English words. Applying this knowledge,\"you\" is selected as the word correspondiag to the \"scehira\" in \"sochira ni{particle} tsutaeru\" because of the small distauee between \"tsutaeru{convey}\" and \"okum{send} \". 3.3.2 Pattern-level transfer knowledge Pattermlevel transler knowledge has variables. The binding words of the variables are regarded as input. For example, \"X o o-negaishimasu\" {X particle will-ask-for} has a variable. Suppose that it is translated into two kinds of English expressions in the example lyclow:","X oo-negaishimasu => may 1 speak to X '3 please give me X' ((jimukyoku{office}), ...), ((hangou(number}),...) In the translation of \"X o o-negaishimasu\", the TE is detennined by the calculation below:","if Min (d((X), (jimukyoku)),....) < Min (d((X), (bangou)),....) then tile TE is \"may I speak to X' else the TE is \"pl-ease give me X' \" Tire following two sentences have the pattern \"X o o-negaishimasu\": (1) \"jinjika{personnel section} o o-negaishimasu.\" (2) \"daimei {title} o o-negaishimasu.\" The first sentence select,; \"may I speak to X' \" because (jinjika) is close to (jimukyoku). The second sentence selects \"please give me X' \" ,because (tlaimei) is close to (bangou). Thus, we get the following translations: (1') \"may I speak to the l)ersnnuel section.\" (2') \"please give me file title,\" 3.3.3 Gramntar-level transfer knowledge Grammar-level transfer knowledge is expressed in terms of grammatical categories. The examples consist of sets of words which are concrete instances of each category. The following transfer knowledge involves sets of three common nouns (CNs): 3A' is the transferred expression of A ACRES DE COLING-92, NANITS, 23-28 AO~t 1992 6 4 7 t'ROC. OF COL1NGO2.

In such cases, the most appropriate structure is selected on the basis of total distance. The least total distance implies that the chosen structure is the most suitable input structure. For example, when the pattern \"X no Y\" is applied to the sentence \"kaigi no touroku hi no waribiki {conference, particle, registration, fee, tkar ticle, discount} \", there are two ppssible structures: (1) kaigi no (touroku hi no waribiki) (2) (kaigi no touroku hi) no waribiki The pattern \"X no Y\" has various TEs, such as in the following","XnoY => Y'ofX' (Ell, El2,...), Y' for X' (E21, E22, ... ), Y'atX' (E3I, E32 .... ), X' Y' (Eel, E42 .... ), The respective TE tree representations constracted from structures (1) and (2) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The structure of (1) transfers to \"Y' of X' \" with the distance value of 0.50 and \"Y' of X' \" with the distance value of 0.17, and generates (1') with a total distance value of 0.67. In structure (2), \"Y' of X' \" with the distance value of 0.17 and \"Y' for X'\" with the distance value of 0.17, generates (2') with a total distance value of 0.34. The latter result is selected because it has the least total distance va~ue. (1') \"discount of the regiswation fee of the conference\" (2') \"discount of registration fee for the conference\"","discount of registration fee of the conference (total distance-0.67) Y' of X' (distanee~0.50) t-X' the conLrence I Y'of X' (distance=0.17) X' Y'"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["registration fee discount","Figure 2 Translation of \"kaigi no (touroku hi no waribiki)\"","discount of registration fee for the conference (total distance-0.34) Y' of X' (distancn=O. 17) X' Y'"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["discount Y' for X' (distance~O.17) W ¥'"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["the conference registration fee","Figure 3 Translation of \"(kaigi no touroku hi) no waribiki\" 4 Example-based Analysis For some structurally complex sentences, translations cannot be performed by applying only transfer knowledge. In such cases, analysis knowledge is also required. The analysis module applies analysis knowledge and supplies the resulting information to the transfer module, which then applies transfer knowledge on the basis of that information. When no analysis knowledge is necessary for translation, the application of only transfer knowledge produces the translation result. The analysis described in this paper is not the understanding of structure and meaning on the basis of a parsing of the input sentence according to grammar rules, but rather the extraction of the information ACq'ES DE COLING-92, NANfES. 23-28 AOfrr 1992 6 4 8 PROC.

Analysis knowledge for normalization is utilized to recover the ellipsis of function words such as particles, and to normalize some variant forms such as sentence-final forms into normal forms.

The sentence \"Watakushi wa Suzuki desu {I, particle, Suzuki, complementizer}\" is uanslated into \" 1 am Suzuki\" by applying transfer knowledge such as the following: XwaYdesu =>X'beY' However, in spoken Japanese, particles are frequently omitted.

Adnominal expressions appear with high frequency in Japanese, corresponding to various English expressions such as relative clauses, infinitives, pronouns, gerunds, and subordinate clauses. They can be detected by means of inflectional forms. Three components of adnominal expressions must be considered in the translation process: the modification relationship, the modifier, and AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES. 23-28 ho(rr 1992 6 4 9 PROC.

The scope of the modifier and the modified is determined by the total distance of each structure in which transfer knowledge is applied.

Due to the restriction of the sequential mechanism, a method for driving the necessary process at the required time has not been completely achieved. However, the following control mechanism is used to obtain the most efficient processing possible. • As much as possible, translation is attempted by first applying only transfer knowledge; when this fails, the system tries to apply analysis knowledge. • Transfer knowledge is applied at the most concrete level as possible, that is, in the order of string, pattern, and grammar level. In order to achieve flexible processing which exchanges necessary translation information, a parallel implementation is under study based on the results from the prototype system. The knowledge base has been built from statistical investigation of the bilingual corpus, whose domain is inquiries concerning international conference registration. The corpus has syntactic correspondences between Japanese and English. We have established transfer and analysis knowledge as follows: • string-level transfer knowledge (about 500 items) • pattern-level transfer knowledge (about 300 items) • grammar-level uansfer knowledge (about 20 items) • analysis knowledge (about 50 items) 6 Evaluation We have evaluated the TDMT prototype system, with the model conversations about conference registration consisting of 10 dialogs and 225 sentences. The model conversations cover basic expressions. Table 1 shows the kinds of knowledge that were required to translate the model conversations.","Table 1 Knowledge Necessary to Translate","Model Conversation ( total number of sentences - 225)","sentences rate string only 73 32.4% pattern and string only 90 40.0% grammar-level 21 9.3% transfer knowledge needed analysis knowledge needed 41 18.2% At present, the prototype system can produce output quickly by the example-basod framework. 200 of the sentences are correct, providing a success rate of 88.9%.

EBMT uses phrase examples and will be integrated with conventional rule-based machine translation.
