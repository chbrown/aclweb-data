They are the word-based best match retrieval methods 1, which need morphological analysis. This paper proposes the character-based best match retrieval method, specifically for Japanese texts Compared with the word-hased methods, the charaeter-h~sed method has the following advantages: • Morphological analysis is unnecessary. • Some kind of synonyms can he retrieved without a thesallrlls.

'riley cannot he found in European languages, i.e., English, French, and German. 1. The number of characters is very large. The numher of characters that are used ill text is more than 7,000 in Japanese. while it is less than a hundred in a European language. 2. Synouyms often have the same Kanji character. Japanese characters are divided into three types'. Hiragana (83 characters), Katakana (86 characters), and Kanji. A ltiragana or Katakana character expresses a sound, and a Kanji character represents a semantic primitive. For example, tile Kanji character \"~\" means \"thinking\", and it is used for constructlug several words concerned with thinking: e.g., ,~( ~(thinking)~ ~\",~, (consideration), ~,~'(deep thinking), ~~Ta (think), ~[~TTa (devise). 3. There is no delimiter between words. In l\"uropean languages, the white space is the delimiter for word separation. In contrast, Japanese has no explicit delimiter. Therefore, the main part of Japanese morphological analysis is to divide a text string into words: it is not easy task a. These characteristics of Japanese suggest the character-based best lllate|l, becanse I While the word-based method needs morphological analysis, the character-bmsed method does not need it.","2. In order to retrieve synonyms the word-based method needs a thesaurus.
