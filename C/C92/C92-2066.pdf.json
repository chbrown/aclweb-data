Early proposals such as Markov Models, N-gram models (Pratt, 1942; Shannon, 1948; Shannon, 1951) and tlidden Markov Models were very quickly shown to be linguistically not appropriate for natural language (e.g. Chomsky (1964, pages 13-18)) since they are unable to capture long distance dependencies or to describe hierarchically the syntax of natural languages. Stochastic context-free granunar (Booth, 1969) is a hierarchical model more appropriate for natural languages, however none of such proposals (Lari and Young, 1990; Jelinek, Lafferty, and Mercer, 1990) perform as well as the simpler Markov Models because of the difficulty of capturing lexical information.

This leads to the difficulty of maintaining a standard hierarchical model while capturing lexieal dependencies. This fact prompted researchers in natural language processing to give up hierarchical language models in the favor of non-hierarchical statistical models over words (such as word N-grams models). Probably for lack of a better language model, it has also been argued that the phenomena that such devices cannot capture occur relatively infrequently. Such argumentation is linguistically not sound. Lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (LTAG) t combine hierarchical structures while being hxieany sensitive and are therefore more appropriate for statistical analysis of language. In fact, LTAGs are the simplest hierarchical formalism which can serve as the basis for lexicalizing context-free grammar (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Sehabes, 1991).

These events of combination are the stochastic processes considered. Since SLTAG are defined on the basis of the derivation and since TAG allows for a notion of derivation independent from the trees that are derived, a precise mathematical definition of the SLTAG derivation must be given. For this purpose, we use stochastic linear indexed grammars (SLIG) to formally express SLTAGs derivations. Linear Indexed grammar (LIG) (Alto, 1968; Gazdar, 1985) is a rewriting system in which the non-terminal symbols are augmented with a stack, in addition to rewriting non-terminals, the rules of the grammar can have the effect of pushing or popping symbols on top of tile stacks that are associated with each non-terminal symbol. A specific rule is triggered by the non-termlnal on the left hand side of the rule and the top element of its associated stack. The productions of a LIG are restricted to copy the stack corresponding to tile non-terminal being rewritten to at most one stack associated with a non-terminal symbol on tile right hand side of the production? In tile following, [..p] refers to a possibly unbounded stack whose top element is p and whose remaining part is schematically written as '..'. [$] represents a stack whose only element is the bottom of the stack. While it is possible to define SLIGs in general, we define them for the particular case where the rules are binary branching and where tile left hand sides are always incomparable. A stochastic linear indexed grammar, G, is denoted by (VN, VT, VI, S, Prod), where VN is a finite set of non-terminal symbols; VT is a finite set of terminal symbols; VI is a finite set of stack symbols; S E VN is the start symbol; Prod is a finite set of productions of the form: Xo[$po] --* a"]},{"title":"Xo[..po] --. x~[..m] x~[$p~] x0[..po] -~ Xl[$pd x~[-.p~]","paragraphs":["Xo[$Po] --~ Xl[$pl] X2[$p2] where Xk E Vjv, a E VT and po ~.

A derivation starts from S associated with the empty stack (S[$]) and each level of the derivation must be validated by a production rule. The language of a SLIG is defined as follows: L = {w E VT~ [ S[$]~w}. The probability of a derivation is defined as the product of tile probabilities of all individual rules involved (counting repetition) in the derivation, the derivation being validated by a correct configuration of the stack at each level. The probability of a sentence is then computed as the sum of the probabilities of all derivations of tile sentence. Following tile construction described in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1991), given a LTAG, Glaa, we construct an equivalent LIG, G,ua. Tile constructed LIG generates tile same language as Gtag and each derivation of Gtaa corresponds to a unique LIG derivation corresponds to a unique derivation in G,ua (and conversely). In addition, a probability is assigned to each production of the LIG.

The non-terminal symbols of Gstia are the two symbols 'top' (t) and 'bottom' (b), tile set of terminal symbols is the same as the one of Gta9, the set of stack symbols is the set of nodes (not node labels) found in the elementary trees of Gla~ augmented with the bottom of tile stack ($), and tile start symbol is 'top' (t).

This corpus is of interest since it has been used for infcrring stochastic context-free grammars from partially bracketed corpora (Pereira and Sehabes, 1992). We use the data given by Pereira and Schabes (1992) on raw text and compare with an inferred SLTAG. The initial grammar consists of all trees (96) of the form fl~, a ~ for all 48 terminal symbols for part-of-speech.

SLTAGs provide a stochastic model both hierarchical and sensitive to lexical information. They combiae the advantages of purely |exical models such ms N-gram distributions or Ilidden Markov Models and the one of ifierarchical modes as stochastic context-free grammars without their inhercnt limitations. The parameters of a SLTAG correspond to the probability of combining two structures each one associated with a word and therefore capture linguistically relevant distributions over words. An algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG was presented as well as an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of raw text. Similarly to its context-free counterpart, the reestimation algorithm can be extended to handle partially parsed corpora (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). Preliminary experiments with a context-free subset of SLTAG confirms that SLTAG enables faster convergence than stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG). This is the case since SCFG are unable to represent lexieal influences on distribution except by a statistically and eomputationally impractical proliferation of nonterminal symbols, whereas SLTAG allows for a lexieally sensitive distributional mmlysis while maintaining a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, the techniques explained in this paper apply to other grammatical formalisms such as combinatory categorial grammars and modified head grammars since they have been proven to be equivalent to tree-adjoining grammars and linear indexed grmnmars (Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1991). Due to the lack of space, only few experiments with SLTAG were reported. A full version of tile paper will be available by tile time of the meeting and more experimental details will be reported during the presentation of the paper. In collaboration with Aravind Joshi, Fernando Pereira and Stuart Slfieber, we are currently investigat-ing additional algorithnLs and applications for SLTAG, methods for lexical clustering and autonratic construction of a SLTAG from a large training corpus."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aho, A.
