I first discuss two previous statistical approaches --- one that concentrates on the probabilities of structural operations, and another that emphasizes co, occurrence relationships between words. I argue that a purely structural approach, exemplified by probabilistie context-free grammar, lacks sufficient sensitivity to lexical context, and, conversely, that lexical co-occurence analyses require a richer notion of locality that is best provided by importing some notion of structure.","I then propose probabilistie TAG as a framework for statistical language modelling, arguing that it provides an advantageous combination of structure, locality, and lexical sensitivity. Issues in the acquisition of probabilistie TAG and parameter estimation are briefly considered."]},{"title":"1 Probabilistic CFGs","paragraphs":["Thanks to the increased availability of text corpora, fast computers, and inexpensive off-line storagc, statistical approaches to issues in natural ]mlguage processing are enjoying a surge of interest, across a wide variety of applications. As research iu tbis area progresses, the question of how to combine our existing knowledge of grammatical methods (e.g. generative power, effÉcient parsing) with dcvelol)ments in statistical and information-theoretic methods (especially techniques imported from the speech-processing community) takes on increasing significance.","Perhaps the most straightforward combination of grammatical and statistical techniques can be found in the probabilistic generalization of context-free gram- *This reaeardl was supported by the following gremts: ARO DAAL 03~9-C-0031, DARPA N00014-90-J-1863, NSF lRI 90-16592, and Ben Franklin 91S.3078C-1, I would like to thank Aravind Joshi, Yves Schabes, and members of the CLIFF group at Penn for helpful discussion.

[Jelinek et al., 1990] characterize a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) as a context-free grammar in which each production has been assigned a probability of use. I will refer to the entire set of probabilities as the statistical parameters, or simply parameters, of the probabilistie grammar.","For exmnple, the productions in Figure 1, together with their associated parameters, might comprise a fragment of a PCFG for English. Note that for each nonterminal symbol, the probabilities of its alternative expansions sum to 1. Tbis captures the fact that in a context-free derivation, each instance of a nontermina] symbol must be rewritten according to exactly one of its expansions. Also by definition of a context-free derivation, each rewriting is independent of the context within which the nonterminal appears. So, for example, in the (leftmost) derivation of We like Mary (Figure 2), the expansions N ~ we and VP --~ V NP are independent events.","The probability of n independent events is ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aot)r 1992 4 1 8 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 merely the product of the probabilities of each individual event. Therefbre the probability of a context-frce derivation with rewritings rt, r~, ..., rn is Pr(rl)Pr(r2) ... Pr(rn).","Jelinek et al. use this fact to develop a set of efficient algorithms (based on the CKY parsing algorithm) to compute the probability of a sentence given a grammar, to find the most probable parse of a given sentence, to compute the probability of an initial substring leading to a sentence generated by the grarmnar, and, following [Baker, 1979], to estimate the statistical parameters for a given grammar using a large text corpus.","Now, the definition of the probability of a derivation that is used for PCFG depends crucially upon the context-freeness of the grammar; without it, the independence assumption that pernfits us to simply multiply probabilities is compromised. Yet experience tells us that rule expmmions are not, in general, context-free. Consider the following simple example. According to one frequency estimate of English usage [~¥tmeis and Kucera, 1982], he is more titan three times as likely as we to appear as a subject pronoun. So if we is replaced with he in Figure 2, the new derivation (of He hke Mary) is accorded far higher probability according to the PCFG, even though He like Mary is not English. The problem extends beyond such obvious cases of agreenmnt: since crushing happens to be more likely than mashing, the probability of deriving lie's crushing potatoes is greater than the probability corresponding derivation for He's mashing potatoes, although we expect the latter to be more likely.","lu short, lexical context matters. Although probn-bilistic context-free grammar captures the fact that not all nonterminal rewritiugs are equally likely, its insensitivity to lexical context makes it less than adequate as a statistical model of natural language, t and weakeus Jelinek et al.'s contention that \"in an ambiguous but appropriately chosen probabilistic CFG (PCFG), correct parses are Ifigh probability parses\" (p. 2). In practical terms, it also suggests that techniques for in-corporatiug lexical context-sensitivity will potentially improve PCFG performance."]},{"title":"2 Co-occurrence Statistics","paragraphs":["A second common approach to the corpus-based in-vestigation of natural language considers instances of words occurring adjacent to each other in the text, or, more generally, words occurring together within a window of fixed size. For example, [Church and tlanks, 1989] use an information-theoretic measure, mutual information, to calculate the degree of association of","1 Independent of the statiatical i~ue, of course, it is also generally accepted that CFGs are gcneratively too weak to model natural ltmguage in its full generality [Shieber, 1985]. word pairs based upon their co-occurrence throughout a large corpus. Tile nmtual information between two events is defined as","• Pr(x, y) l(x; Y) = tOgp~) where, for tile purposes of corpus analysis, Pr(x) and Pr(y) are the respective probabilities of words x and y appearing within the corpus, and Pr(z, y) is the probability of word x being followed by word y within a window of w words. Intuitively, mutual information relates the actual probability of seeing x and y together (numerator) to the probability of seeing them together under the as~sumption that they were independent events (denominator).","As defined here, tbe calculation of mutual information takes into account only information about co-occurrence within surface strings. A difficulty with such an al~proash, however, is that cO-occurrences of interest may not lie sufficiently local. Although sentence (1)a can witness the co-oceurence of students and spend within a small window (say, w = 2 or 3), sentence (1)b cannot.","(1)a. Students spend a lot of money. b. Students who attend conferances spend a lot","of money. Simply increasing the window size will not suffice, for two rc~sons. First, there is no bound on the length of relative clauses such as the one in (1)b, hence no fixed value of w that will solve the problem. Second, the choice of window size depends on the application -- Church and Hanks write that \"smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales\" (p. 77). Extending the window size in order to capture co-occurrences such as the one found in (1)1) may therefore undermine other goals of the analysis.","[Brown et ul., 1991] encounter a similar problem. Their application is statistics-driven machine translation, where the statistics are calculated on the basis of trigranm (observed triples) of words within the source and target corpora. As in (1), sentences (2)a and (3)a illustrate a difficulty encountered when limiting window size. Light verb constructions are an example of a situation in which the correct translation of the verb depends on the identity of its object. The correct word sense of p~ndre, \"to make,\" is chosen in (2)a, since the dependency signalling that word sense -- between prcndre and its object, decision -- falls within a trigram window and thus within the bounds of their language model.

Without additional information about the verb's object, the system relies on the fact that the sense of prendre a.~ \"to take\" occurs with greater frequency, and tire incorrect translation results.","Brown et al. propose to solve the problem by seek-ing clues to a word's sense within a larger context. Each possible clue, or informant, is e~ site relative to the word. For prendre, the informant of interest is \"the first noun to the right\"; other potential informants include \"the first verb to the right,\" and so on. A set of such potential informants is defined in advance, and statistical techniques are used to identify, for each word, which potential informant contribntes most to determining the sense of the word to use.","It seems clear that in most cases, Brown et al.'s informants represent approximations to structural relationships such as subject and object. Examples (1) through (3) suggest that attention to structure would have advantages for the analysis of lexical relationships. By using co-occurrence within a structure rather than co-occurrence within a window, it is possible to capture lexical relationships without regard to irrelevant intervening material. One way to express this notion is by saying that structural relationships permit us to use a notion of locality that is more general than simple distance in the surface string. So, for example, (1) demonstrates that the relationship between a verb and its subject is not affected by a subject relative clanse of any length."]},{"title":"3 Hybrid Approaches","paragraphs":["In the previous sections I have observed that probabillstic CFGs, though capable of capturing the relative likelihoods of context-free derivations, require greater sensitivity to lexical context in order to model natural languages. Conversely, lexica] co-occurrence analyses seem to require a richer notion of locality, something that structural relationships such as subject and object can provide. In this section I briefly discuss two proposals that could be considered \"hybrid\" approaches, making use of both grammatical structure and lexical co-occurrence,","The first of these, [Hindle, 1990], continues in the direction suggested at the end of the previous section: rather than using \"informants\" to approximate structural relationships, lexical eo-oecnrrenee is calculated over structures. Hindle uses co-occurrence statistics, collected over parse trees, in order to classify nouns on the basis of the verb contexts in which they appear. First, a robust parser is used to obtain a parse tree (possibly partial) for each sentence. For example, the following table contains some of the information Hindle's parser retrieved from the parse of the sentence \"The clothes we wear, the food we eat, the air we breathe, the watcr we drink, the land that sustains us, and many of the prodncts we use are the result of agricultural research.\" I verb ] subject I object I e~t we food breathe we air drink we water sust'ain land us","Next, Hindle calculates a similarity measure based on tile mutual information of verbs and their arguments: nouns that tend to appear as subjects and objects of the sanae verbs are judged more similar. According to the criterion that that two nouns be reciprocally most similar to each other, Hindle's analysis derives such plausible pairs of similar nonns as ruling and decision, battle and fight, researcher and scientist.","A proposal in [Magerman and Marcus, 1991] relates to probabilistie parsing. As in PCFG, Magerman and Marcus associate probabilities with the rules of a context-free grammar, but these probabilities are conditioned on the contexts within which a rule is observed to be used. It is in the formulation of \"context\" that lexical co-occurrence plays a role, albeit an indirect one.","Magerman and Marcus's Pearl parser is essentially a bottom-up chart parser with Earley-style top-down prediction. When a context-free rule A -~ al...a~ is proposed as an entry in ttle chart spanning input symbols al through ai, it is assigned a \"score\" based on","1. tile rule that generated this instance of nontermihal symbol A, and 2. tile part-of-speech trigram centered at al. For example, given the input My first love was named Pearl, a proposed chart entry VP---+ V NP starting its span at love (i.e., a theory trying to interpret love as a verb) would be scored on the basis of the rule that generated the VP (in this ease, probably S ---* NP VP) together with the part-of-speech trigram \"adjective verb verb.\" This score would be lower than that of a different chart entry interpreting love as a noun, since the latter would be scored using the more likely part of speech trigram \"adjective noun verb\". So, although tire context-free probability favors the in-terpretation of love as the beginning of a verb phrase, ACRES DI\" COLUqG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOl3\"r 1992 4 2 0 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 information about the lexical context of the word rescues the correct interpretation, in which it is categorized as a noun.","Although Pearl does not take into account tile relationships between particular words, it does represent a promising combiuation of CFG-based probahilistic parsing mid corpus statistics calculated on the basis of simple (trigram) co-occurrences.","A difficulty with the hybrid approaches, however, is that they leave unclear exactly what the statistical model of tile language is. In probabilistic context:i~ee grannnar and in surface-string analysis of lexical c(> occurrence, there is a precise deIinition of the event space -- what events go into making up a sentence. (As discussed earlier, the events in a PCFG derivation are the rule expansions; the events in a window-baqed analysis of surface strings call be viewed as transitions in a finite Markov chain modelling the language.) The absence of sitch a characterization in the hybrid approaches makes it more difficult to identify what as-sumptions are being made, and gives such work a decidedly empirical flavor."]},{"title":"4 Probabilistic TAG","paragraphs":["4.1 Lexicalized TAG The previous sections have demonstrated a need for a well-defned statistical framework in which both syntactic structure and texical co, occurrences are incorporated. In thLs section, I argue that a probabilistic form of lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar provides just such a seamless combination. [ begin with a brief description of lcxicalized tree-adjoining grammar, and then present its probabilistic generalization and the advantages of the resulting formalism.","\"l~'ec~adjoining grammar [Joshi ctaL, 1975], or TAG, is a generalization of context-fl'ee grannnar that has been proposed as a useful forlualism for the study of natural languages. A tree-adjoining grammar eompriscs two sets of elementary structures: initial trees and auxiliary trees. (See l,'igure 3, in which initial and auxiliary trees are labelled using cr and f3, respectively.) An auxiliary tree, by definition, has a uonterminal node on its frontier - tile fool node -- that matches the nonterminal symbol at its root.","These elementary structures can be combined using two operations, substitution and adjunction. The substitution operation corresponds to the rewriting of a symbol in a context-free derivation: a nonterminal node at the frontier of a tree is replaced with au initial tree having the same nonterminal symbol at its rout. So, for example, one could expand either NP in al by rewriting it as tree ccu.

The significance of this distinction will become apparent shortly.","A lcxicalized tree-adjoining gra~nmar is it TAG in which each elemcutary structure (initial or auxiliary tree) has a lexieal item on its frontier, known as its anchor [Schabes, 1990].

First, since every tree is associated with a lexica] anchor, words and their associated structures are tightly linked. Thus, unlike probabilistic context-free grammar, the probabilities associated with structural operations are sensitive to lexical context. In particular, the probability of an adjunetion step such as the one that produced 71, above, is sensitive to the lexical anchors of the trees. One would expect a similar adjunction of ~1 into aa (resulting in the string roasted people) to have extremely low probability, reflecting the low degree of association between the lexical items in-volved. Similarly, tree aa is far more likely than a2 to be substituted as the subject NP in tree ~1, since people is more likely than peanuts to appear as the subject of eat.","Notice that this attention to lexical context is not acquired at the expense of the independence assumption for probabilities. Just as expansion of a nonterminal node in a CFG derivation takes place without regard to that node's history, substitution or adjunction to a node during a TAG derivation takes place without regard to that node's history, a Thus it will be straightforward to express the probability of a probabilistic TAG derivation as a product of probabilities, just as was the case for PCFG, yielding a well-defined statistical model.","Second, since TAG factors local dependencies from recursion, the problem of intervening material in window-based lexical co-occurrence analyses does not arise. Notice that in tree c~t, the verb, its subject, and its object all appear together within a single elementary structure. The introduction of recursive substructure -- relative clauses, adverbs, strings of adjectival modifiers -- is done entirely by means of the adjunction operation, as illustrated by figures 4 and 5. This fact provides a principled treatment of examples such as (4): the probability of substituting cr 2 as the object NP of ax (capturing an association between eat and peanuts) 2LexicMized TAG is only one of meaty sudl graznmar for-malisms, of course. 3Schabes (personal communication) capture~ the generallza-tion quite nicely in obscxving that for both CFG derivation trees and TAG derivation histories, the path setA (set of possible paths from root to frontier) are regular. is independent of any other operations that might take place, such as the introduction (via adjunction) of an adjectival modifier. Similarly, the probability of substituting aa as the subject NP of al is not affected by the subsequent adjunction of a relative clause (cf. exampie (1)). Thus, in contrast to a co-occnrrence analysis based on strings, the analysis of (4) within probabilistic TAG finds precisely the same relationship between the verb and its arguments in (4)b and (4)c as it does in (4)a.","(4)a. People eat peanuts. b. People eat roasted peanuts. c. People who are v~iting the zoo eat roasted","peanuts.","Third, the notion of lexical anchor in lexicalized TAG has been generalized to account for multi-word lexicat entries [Abeill6 and Schabes, 1989]. Thus the formalism appears to satisfy the criteria of [Smadja and McKeown, 1990], who write of the need for \"a flexible lexicon capable of using single word entries, multiple word entries as well as phrasal templates and a mechanism that would be able to gracefully merge and combine them with other types of constraints\" (p. 256).

First, since the algorithm re-estimates parameters but does not determine the rules in the grammar, the structures underlying the statistics (ares, rules, trees) must bc determined in some other fashion. The starting point can be a hand-written grammar, which requires considerable effort and linguistic knowledge; altcrnatively, one can initially include all possible structures and let tim statistics weed out useless rules by assigning them near-zero probability. A third possibility is to add an engine that hypothesizes rules on the basis of observed data, a~ld then let the parameter estimation operate over these hypothesized structures. Which possibility is best depends upon the application and the breadth of linguistic coverage needed.","Second, any statistical approach to natural language nmst consider tim size of the parameter set to be estimated.

Thus observations that would be the same for the trigram model can be fragmented in the TAG model. As a result of this fragmentation, each individual event is observed fewer times, and so the model is more vulnerable to statistical inaccuracy resulting from low counts.","The acquisition of a probababilistie tree-adjoining grammar \"from the ground up,\" that is, including hypothesizing grammatical structures as well as estimat-ing statistical parameters, is an intended topic of future work."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["1 have argued that probabilistic 'rAG provides a seamless framework that combines the simplicity and structure of the probabilistie CFG approach with the lexieal sensitivity of string-based co-occurrence analyses.
