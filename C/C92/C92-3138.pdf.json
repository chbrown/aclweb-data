Through this reformulation wc gain full reversibility for the SFG description and access for unification-based grammar descriptions to the rich semantic levels of description that SFG supports. We illustrate this reformulation with respect to both generation mid semantic aalalysis and set out the future goals for research this result establishes. 1 Introduction The current state of the art in natural language processing calls for components Callable of sophisticated deep semantic analysis, modular representation of resources, and re-usability of those resources across different NLP applications. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the sheer diversity of interactions between distinct kinds of linguistic information is guaranteed to defeat any staged approach to generation/understandiug that successively maps between levels of representation [1]. One strategy for addressing these problems is to stratify resources so that inter-stratal mappings are simplified. This is aimed at allowiug high-level information to apply as early in analysis ms possible at a minimal cost. A number of current processing architectures call for such a design. The stratification technique is also one way of ensuring modularity and improved re-usability. However, one important problem with al-most all existing linguistic resources is that the inter-stratal mappings between, for example, strings and semantics, are anything but simple. This,is because the standard syntax-semantics-pragmatics modular-ization under-stratifies by imposing fewer distinctious than are necessary. Computational systemic-functional grammars [4] offer significant solutions to this deficiency by imposing a higher degree of stratification (cf. Section 3), thus keeping inter-stratal relations simple. SFGs have supported the constrnction of natural language generation components that are able to take highly abstract, purely semantic specifications as input and produce corresponding surface strings as output. Furthermore, the generation task ha.s required extensive work on the more abstract strata: without a rich breadth of communicative goals, grammatical resonrces for expression cannot be satisfactorily constrained. Problematic with current computational instantiations of SFG, however, is that implementations have been directionally committed: the higher strata of information have not been available for constraining lower level analyses. This problem has been compounded by a further lack of detail at the lower, syntagmatic/constituency stratum in SFG. In contrast \"Also on indefinite leave from the Penman Project, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, Los Angeles. °*Supported by BMFT Grant No. 08 B3116 3 to tile generation perspective, work oriented towards analysis -- particularly within current information-based grammars such as LFG and HPSG -- has paid cxtensive attention to the less abstract strata of the linguistic system and have produced highly detailed accounts of syntagmatic organization. A combina-tion of the two paradigms shmdd enable us to fill gaps in the respective coverage of strata. Information-based grammars have already been presented using declarative representations such as feature structures. In this paper, we present a for-realization of all tile information to be found in the strata of computational SFG and their inter-stratal mappiugs in terms of feature structures also in order to initiate a combined description of the two paradigms. In particalar, we will formalize SFG in terms of the Typed-Feature System (TFS) developed within the POLYGLOSS project at Stuttgart. TFS has previously been applied to the strata of the linguistic system addressed by HPSG and LFG. Here, we argne further that it is appropriate to adopt this representation for SFGs and the higher strata of the linguistic system that SFG proposes. The result of this inquiry is then to provide the basis for populating a highly-stratified processing architecture with maximally appropriate linguistic representations. Moreover, the higher levels of abstraction are rarely dealt with within a theory that talks about syntax. Rather, their treatment is left to a separate process using a separate representation language and a completely separate processing strategy. Our approach offers a solution to this problem as well by providiug a unique framework to talk about (almost) all levels of linguistic information in a single formal language using a single processing scheme."]},{"title":"2 A","paragraphs":["convergence of concerns We now briefly introduce both SFG and TFS; substantial introductious are provided elsewhere and so here we shall only offer sufficient details to under-stand the examl)les offered in the paper. 2.1 The SFG framework Analogously to HPSG and LFG, SFG belongs to the family of grammatical frameworks based on statements of the co-occurrence possibilities of grammatical features. In contrast, however, SFG places central focus on grammar as a complex resource for achieving commmficative and social goals. Within SFG the entire grammatical description of a language is organized around a factorization of the task of finding grammatical structures appropriate for the expression of specified meanings and it is this orientation that has made it so appealing for the task of generation. The organization of the PENMaN-style architecture within which the SFG of English we are working with is embedded decomposes the mapping from abstract semantics to surface string as follows. Nearest the surface there are realization statementa of syntagmatic organization, or syntactic form. These are ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt)r 1992 9 1 6 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 classified it* terms of a grantmatical system network that denotes the paradigmatic, functional 'alternatives offered by syntactic forms. The decisions in the grammatical systems network are motivated by serum*tic distinctions that classify semantic circumstances ax:cording to the grammatical features which are appropriate to express those situations: this classification is the cmnbined responsibility of choosers attd inquiries. Finally, the possibilities for classification that the inquiries have are defined in terms of an abstract ontology called the upper model. Knowledge about particular domains is subordinated to the upper model so that the concepts of those donlains can inherit their possibilities for linguistic realization from those already specified for the upper model concepts. Also, lexical information is typically a.qsociatcd with the domain concepts. All of these components are currently implemented and used within the PENMAN and KOMET projects. The upper model and domain nmdcl are implemented in the knowledge rcpresentation language LOOM (developed at USC/ISI); the remain-ing theoretical constructs involved in the generation process are realized ms macros defined in Common-Lisp. These latter are, therefore, in implenmntation strictly procedural attd do not support analysis. For further details of the underlying theory atnl its application in the area of text generation see [4]. 2.2 The TFS framework The TFS formalism is a rewriting system for typed feature terms fonowing ideas from [5]. The major goal when designing TFS às a grannnar description language was to develop a formalism that inherently supports botix modular, hierarchically organized descriptions and a declarative formulation of relationships between (partial) elements front different linguistic modules. The objects used to represent linguistic information are typed feature terms, i.e., feature terms that have a type symbol associated with each node in the directed graph representing an ordinary feature term. A linguistic description consists of a set of feature type definitions which contain information about the placement of the feature term in the type hierarchy and about the set of well-formedness constraints that hold for this particular type. The feature type definitions define the well-formedness constraints for all representatiun levels, sinmltaneously specifying what constitutes a 'well-formed linguistic sign', i.e., an object containing all the information that can be collected about an utterance - be it analyzed (where the phonological lotto of the utteronce is the inpnt), or generated (where parts of the 'content' of the complete description serves ms tile input); an example of such an object appears below in Figure 3.","Given a partial description (a feature term with (possibly partial) type information) as input, the in-terpreter computes the set of most specific feature terms derivable from that term by first classifying the term according to the features it contains and their values, and subsequently reeursively applying feature type definitions to all type symbols contained in the term. Only one operation is used: Rewriting based on unifying substitutions of feature terms. For full details of the formalism and its ilnplementation see [6, 7]. Since the TFS language is fundamentally a constraint-based language, and none of the opera-tions involved is dependent on a particular order of, e.g., the availability of certain pieces of information, no directionality is involved in the constraint-solving process. Thus, a snccessful encoding of the information contained in a systemic grammar description in TFS will of necessity be strictly bidirectional. In fact, the specification of well-formed linguistic signs simultaneously for all strata represented means that the term non-directionality is a better characteriza-tion of the distinctive property of this kind of system than, for example, \"reversibility\". 3 Modelling of SFG in TFS We now describe in some detail how each of the strata, atnl the relations between them that are detilted within cmnputational SFG, may be defined uniformly within TFS. This supports the general clv:im made within SFG that statements of linguistic resources should be non-directional. We will begin with the least abstract stratmn - the system network -attd work up to the most abstract level - the upper model. We then describe the inter-stratal maptfings that exist between these. 3.1 The System Network A system network can Ixe represented ,as a directed acyclic graph with labelled arcs whose nodes are choice points called systems and whose outward directed labelled arcs denote the terms of the system. Each system has two or more terms, or output features, which at the stratum of granlmar represent minimal gralnmaticM alternations. Reflecting the extensive stratification of the arclfitecture, nothing is said in the system network proper abont how to choose between these alternations. The inward directed arcs for each systent denote an entry condition which deternfines the paradigmatic context in which the alternation represented by the system is relevant. As shown already in [3], the network is formally equivalent to the specification of a subsumption hierarchy and so the translation of the connectivity of that network Mone into TFS is quite straightforward. The resnlt is a lattice with most general type RANK.","The system nctwurk does not itself generate grammat*cat structures; this information is also stratified out. In SFG grammatical structure is built up in terms of 'syntagmatic specifications' which are derived by means of realization statements associated with paradigmatic selections. Kasper [2] shows how these realization statements can be represented in terms of feature structure descriptions. We largely adopt this representation here. The possible realization statements arc listed in the table shown below, together with their translations into TFS feature ternxs.","+F ~F~.'

The Presolect, Classify/Inflectify and Lexify statements have similar translations, tile only difference being that they do not only determine tile type of the value of the feature they introduce, but also specifically determine the value itself; lexify is then the limiting case where a type drawn front the sublattice of lexical items may be specified directly.

Every concept in the hierarchy corresponds to a type in TFS, where the content of the :is slot corresponds to the specification of the appropriate supertype for the given concept. There are two possible ways to build up tile hierarchy of concepts for the Upper Model: we can follow a pure top-down strategy, specifying via stepwise refinement what subconcepts make up a given concept. This is appropriate whenever the LOOM definition contains a statement about :disjoint-covering. The second possibility is to build up the hierarchy bottom up, i.e., for a type we specify what its supertype is. This is mostly used when the type-definltion has additional constraints, which are then conjunctively conjoined to the supertype specification, thus refining the definition of the current type.

Our encoding of this level of organization in TFS moves away from the implementation in PENMAN by making use of the fact that choosers are themselves hierarchically organized. While in PENMAN this organization is maintained only indirectly by the as-sociation with grammatical systems, in TFS we define tile sublattice explicitly using types defined for choosers.

It is clear that for these inquiries to be implemented, a specific semantic representation must have been selected.

Identifying inquiries are used in chooser actions of the following form: (ides'airy F 1 (inq-ID F 2)). This specifies that the semantic entity returned by applying the inquiry inq-ID to the semantic entity associated with tile grammatical constituent labelled as F 2 is associated with the grammatical constituent labelled as F 1.

After classifying the input structure according to tile features it contains (already yielding a paxticular subtype of CHOOSER), the type of the topmost node of the input structure is then recursively expanded. Expansion is performed by rewriting all embedded types through unifying substitution of their definitio~ls until no filrther rewriting is possible (i.e., until all types are ground types). Expansion terminates with a conq)lcte description coralmtible with the input partial description and with the definitions ill the feature type system representing \"all the linguistic strata defined.

The complete structure which is the result of the interprctation of the semantic specification (given under the nero feltture) is given in Figure 3. 4.2 Analysis As stated in Section 1, SFG suffers front a lack of specificity in its syntagmatic representations; the kind of specifications that we find inunediately underlying strings in the PENMAN and KOMET systems, for example, gives representations (expressed according to our TFS definitions of Section 3.1 above) such as the following: R.ANK [gr-procean : LEI-DEV'OOR,","subject: [thihg: LEI~KIM],","dixectcomplsment : [thing: LEI-COOKIE,","doietie: LEX-EVERY] ] ]","However, information-based syntax, such :as HPSG, does provide cxtensive detail at this level.

We have shown that systemic-functional grammars and semantics can easily be converted to the TFS formalism. This has produced a fragment that can both generate and analyse. Furthermore, the analysis achieved with our experimental fragment supports the mapping from surface representation to deep semantic levels of representation that are far removed from the contingencies of surface syntax. These represeutatimts also preserve breadth, in that the semantic distinctions necessary for generation concerning 'pragmatic' information such as textual organization and interpersonal communicative goals are also recovered. It is especially imt)ortaut that all of these diverse levels have now been made accessible for analysis within a system where there is only one representational formalism and only one interpretational device operating on the representations.","This paper has described and motivated the basis for a host of important further research questions, some of which we are now following up. For example, the fragment we have illustrated here is very small: the problem of handling large lattices needs to be addressed both on implementational aud theoretical levels. A fldl specification of the grammar component of PENMAN alone as we describe it here would involve tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of types: this ueeds to be supported by sufficiently powerful and robust implementations. But on the theorcticai level, there are also further nmdularities within the SFG account that we have not yet utilized to constrain term explosions due to form-ing cross-products across sublattices: two areas here clearly present themselves --- stronger modulariza-tion according to the paradigmatic/syntagmatic dimensiou and according to functional regions in the grammar [4], which already provide a meta-level of organization across sublattices that remains unused. A fnrther area is a closer study of the similarities and differeuces between, e.g., the information of the SFG and the HPSG modules -- it is to be expected that there is currently duplication which could be more effectively distributed, perhaps providing a more effective TFS translation. Finally, the availability of a representation of some systenfic-functional grammars in a standard formalism should further facilitate comparison and evaluation of the grammatic',d description with respect to other current cmnputational accounts of grammar: it should be more straightforward to identify the distinctive features and claims of the approach, thus opening the door to an easier exchange of information and analyses. Further, performing the TFS translation for the entire PENMAN grammar would provide an effective test of the TFS formalism (and its implementation) overall since there are no comparable grammars (i.e., paradigmatic feature based without a phrase structure skeleton) of this size available elsewhere."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Martin Emele, Ulrich Held, Stefan Momma, and R~mi Zajac.
