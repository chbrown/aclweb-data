The parser is based on a wide coverage grammar for English, developed by the New York University's Linguistic String Project, and it uses the machine-readable version of the Oxford Advanced lw~arner's Dictionary as a source of its basic vocabulary. The parser operates on stochastically tagged text, and contains a powerful skip-and-fit recovery mechanism that allows it to deal with extra-grammatical input and to operate effectively under a severe time pressure. Empirical experiments, testing parser's speed and accuracy, were performed on several collections: a collection of technical abstracts (CACM-3204), a corpus of news messages (MUC-3), a selection from ACM Computer Library database, and a collection of Wall Street Journal articles, approximately 50 million words in total. 1. INTRODUCTION","Recently, there has been a growing demand for fast and reliable natural language processing tools, capable of performing reasonably accurate syntactic analysis of large volumes of text within an acceptable time. A full sentential parser that produces complete mmlysis of input, may be considered reasonably fast if the average parsing time per sentence falls anywhere between 2 and 10 seconds. A large volume of text, perhaps a gigabyte or more, would contain as many as 7 million sentences. At the speed of say, 6 sec/sentence, this much text would require well over a year to parse. While 7 million sentences is a lot of text, this much may easily he contained in a fair-sized text database. Therefore, the parsing speed would have to be increased by at least a factor of 10 to make such a task manageable.","In this paper we describe a fast and robust natural language parser that can analyze written text and generate regularized parse structures at a speed of below 1 second per sentence. In the experiments conducted on variety of natural langauge texts, including technical prose, news messages, and newspaper articles, the average parsing time varied between 0.4 sec/sentence and 0.7 see/sentence, or between 1600 and 2600 words per minute, as we tried to find an acceptable compromise between parser's speed and precision.l","It has long been assumed that in order to gain speed, one may have to trade in some of the purser's accuracy. For example, we may have to settle for partial parsing that would recognize only selected grammatical structures (e.g. noun phrases; Ruge et al., 1991), or would avoid making difficult decisions (e.g. pp-attachment; Hindle, 1983). Much of the overhead and inefficiency comes from the fact that the lexical and structural ambiguity of natmal language input can only be dealt with using limited context information available to the parser. Partial parsing techniques have been used with a considerable success in processing large volumes of text, for example AT&T's Fidditch (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) parsed 13 million words of Associated Press news messages, while MIT's parser (de Marcken, 1990) was used to process the 1 million word Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus. In both cases, the parsers were designed to do partial processing only, that is, they would never attempt a complete analysis of certain constructions, such as the attachment of pp-adjuncts, subordinate clauses, or coordina-tions. This kind of partial analysis may be sufficient in some applications because of a relatively high precision of identifying correct syntactic dependencies. 2 However, the ratio at which these dependencies are identified (that is, the recall level) isn't sufficiently high due to the inherently partial character of the parsing process. The low recall means that many of the important dependencies are lost in parsing, and","t These results were obtained on a 21 MIPS SparcStafion ELC. The experiments were performed within an information retrieval system so that the final recall and precision statistics were used to rnealurc effectiwmess of the panmr.","a Hindle and Rooth (1991) and Church and Hanks (1990) used partial parses generated by Fidditch to study word ~urrt.nc¢ patterns m syntactic contexts.

Encountering a construction that it couldn't handle, the parser would first try to produec an approxinmte analysis of the difficult fragment, and then resume normal processing for the rest of the input. The outcome is a kind of \"fitted\" parse, reflecting a compromise between the actual input and grammar-encoded preferences (imposed, mainly, in rule ordering)) 2. SKIP-ANI)-FIT RECOVERY IN PARSING","A robust parser must deal efficiently with difficult input, whether it is an exUa-gmmmatical string, or a string whose complete analysis could be. considered too costly. Frequently, these two situations am not distinguishable, estmcially for long and complex sentences found iu free running text. The parser must be able to analyze such strings quickly and produec at least partiM stractures, imposhlg preferences when necessary, and even removing or inserting small input fragments, if the data-driven processing falters.

If the purpose of this skip-and-fit technique is to get the purser smoothly through even the most complex strings, the amount of additional backtracking caused by the lexical level ambiguity ks certain to defeat it. Without lexical disambigaation of input, the purser's performance will deteriorate, even if the .skipping is limited only to certain types of adverbial adjuncts. The most common cases of lexical ambiguity are tho~ of a phwal noun (nns) vs. a singular verb (vbz), a singular noun (nn) vs. a plmal or infinitive verb (vbp,vb), and a past tense verb (vbd) vs. a past participle (vbn), as illusWatod in the following exarnple.","The notation used (vbn or vl~l?) explicitly asse.ci-","ates (nns or vbz?) a data structure (vb or nn)","shared (vbn or vbd?) by concun-ent processes (nn.,~","or vbz?) wiflt operatimLs defirmd (vbn or vbd?) cut","it. 3. PART OF SPEECH TAGGER","Oue way of dealing with lexical ambiguity is to use a tagger to preproccss the input marking each wurti with a tags that indicates its syntactic categoriza.- tion: a part of speech with selected morphological features such as nunther, tense, mode, case and degree.

In the examples ahove, tagging of presents as \"vbz\" in the first sentence cuts off a potentially long and cosily \"garden path\" with presents as a plural noun followed by a headless relative clause starting with (that) a proposal .... In the second sentence, tagging resolves ambiguity of used (vim vs. vbd), and associates (vbz vs. nns). Perhaps more imlxmantly, elimination of word-level lexical ambiguity allows the parser to make projection about the input which is yet to be parsed, using a simple lookabead; in particular, phrase boundaries can be determined with a degree of confidence (Church, 1988). This latter property is critical for implementing skip-and-fit recovery technique outlined in the previous section.","Tagging of input also helps to reduce the number of parse structures that can be assigned to a sentence, decreases the demand for consulting of the dictionary, and simplifies dealing with unknown words. Since every item in the sentence is assigned a tag, so are the words for which we have no entry in the lexicon. Many of these words will be tagged as \"np\" (proper noun), however, the surrounding tags may force other selections.

PARSING wITH TTP PARSER","TTP (Tagged Text Parser) is a top down English parser specifically designed for fast, reliable processing of large amounts of text.","6 We use the machine wadable version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD).","7 The program, suppfiod to us by Bolt Benmck and Newman, openttes in two almmative modes, either telocting • single most likely tag for each word (best-tag option, the one we use •t prcaenO, or supplying t slion tanked list of alternatives (Mercer et al., 1991).","TTP is based on the Linguistic String Grammar developed by Sager (1981). Written in Quintus Prolog, the parser currently encompasses more than 400 grammar productions, s TIP produces a regularized representation of each lmrsed sentence that reflects the sentence's logical structure. This representation may differ considerably from a standard Imrse tree, in that the constituents get moved around (e.g., de. passivization, de--dativization), and the phrases are organized recursively around their head elements. An important novel feature of TIP parser is that it is equipped with a time-out mechanism that allows for fast closing of more difficult sub-constituents after a preset amount of time has elapsed without producing a parse. Although a complete analysis is attempted for each sentence, the parser may occasionally ignore fragments of input to resume \"normal\" processing after skipping a few words. These fragments are latex analyzed separately and attached as incomplete constituents to the main parse tree.","As the parsing ixoceeds, each sentence receives a new slot of time during which its parse is to be returned. The amount of time allotted to any particular sentence can be regulated to obtain an acceptable compromise between parser's speed and precision. In our experiments we found that 0.5 see/sentence time slot was appropriate for the CACM abstracts, while 0.7 see/sentence was more appropriate for generally longer sentences in MUC-3 articles. 9 The actual length of the time interval allotted to any one sentence may depend on this sentence's length in words, although this dependency need not be linear. Such adjustments will have only limited impact on the parser's speed, but they may affect the quality of produced parse trees. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to evaluate quality of parsing except by using its results to attain some measurable ends. We used the parsed CACM collection to generate domain-specific word correla-tions for query processing in an information retrieval system, and the results were satisfactory. For other applications, such as information extraction and deep understanding, a more accurate analysis may be required, m","* See (Strzalkowski, 1990) for Prolog implementation details.","Giving the parser more time per sentence doesn't always mean that • belmr (more accurate) parse will be obtained.

OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992","Initially, a full analysis of each sentence is attempted. If a parse is not returned before the allotted time elapses, the parser enters the time-out mode. From this point on, the parser is permitted to skip portions of input to reach a starter terminal for the next constituent to be parsed, and closing the currently opea one (or ones) with whatever partial representation has been generated thus far. The result is an approximate partial parse, which shows the overall structure of the sentence, from which some of the constituents may be missing. The fragments skipped in the first pass are not thrown out, instead they are analyzed by a simple phrasal post-processor that looks for noun phrases and relative clauses and then attaches the recovered material to the main parse structure.","The time-out mechanism is implemented using a straightforward parameter passing and is at present limited to only a sub~et of nonterminals used by the grammar. Suppose that X is such a nonterminal, and that it appears on the right-hand side of a production S ---> X Y Z. The set of \"starters\" is computed for Y, which consists of the word tags that can occur as the left-most constituent of Y. This set is passed as a parameter while the parser attempts to recognize X in the input. If X is recognized successfully within a preset time, then the parser proceeds to parse a Y, and nothing else happens. On the other hand, if the parser cannot determine whether there is an X in the input or not, that is, it neither succeeds nor fails in parsing X before being timed out, the unfinished X constituent is closed with a partial l~rse, and the parser is restarted at the closest element from the sta~ers set for Y that can be found in the remainder of the input. If Y rewrites to an empty string, the starters for Z to the right of Y are added to the starters for Y and both sets are passed as a parameter to X.

In particular, the following problems must be resolved to assure parser's effectiveness: how to select starter tags for non-terminals, how to select non-terminals at which to place the starter tags, and finally how to select non-terminals at which input skipping call occur.","Obviotlsly some tags are mote likely to occur at the left-most position of a constituent than others. ~ly, a subject ~ can start with u word tagged with any element from the following fist: Ixlt, dt, cd, ji, jjr, jjs, pp, ppS, nn, nns, np, nps, vbg, vbo, rb, in} 2 In practice, however, we may select only a subset of these, as shown in the"]},{"title":"clause","paragraphs":["production above.

In a most straightforward design, when a nonterminal X is timed-out, the parser would skip input until it has reached a starter element of a nonterminal Y adjacent to X from the right, according to the top-down predictions, t3 On the other hand, certain adjunct phrases may be of little interest, possibly because of their typically low information contents, and we may choose to ignore them altogether. Therefore, if X is timed out, and Y is a low contents adjunct phrase, we can make the parser to jump fight to the next nonterminal Z.

If wrong non-terminals are chosen the parser may generate rather uninteresting structures that would be next to useless, or it may become trapped in inadvertently created dead ends, hopelessly trying to fit the parse. Consider, for example, the following sentence, taken from MUC-3 corpus of news messages:","HONDURAN NATIONAL POLICE ON MON-","DAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS HON-","DURAN JUAN BAUTISTA NUNEZ AMADOR","AND NICARAGUAN LUIS FERNANDO OR-","DON[~ REYES, WHO TOLD REPORTERS","THAT COMMANDER AURELIANO WAS AS-","SASSINATED ON ORDERS FROM JOSE DE","JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY","CHIEF OF SECURITY. After reaching the verb PRESENTED, the parser consalts the lexicon and finds that one of the possible subcategorizations of this verb is [pun,to], that is, its object suing can be a prepositional phrase with 'to' followed by a noun phrase. The parser thus begins to look for a prepositional phrase starting at \"TO THE PRESS ...\", but unfortunately misses the end of the phrase at PRESS (the following word is tagged as a noun), and continues until reaching the end of sentence. At this point it realizes that it went too far (there is no noun phrase left), and starts backing up. Before the parser has a chance to back up to the word PRESS and correct the early mistake, however, the time-out mode is turned on, and instead of abandoning the current analysis, the parser now tries hard to fix it by skipping varying portions of input. This may take a considerable amount time if the skip points are badly","i~ Note that the top-down predictions are crucial for the skipping parser, wheahcr the paner's processing is top-down or bouem-up. t4 :mbta//it the remainder of a discontinued subject phrase. placed. On the other hand, we wouldn't like to allow an easy exit by accepting an empty noun phrase at the end of the sentenceI ]5","One of the essential properties of the input skipping mechanism is its flexibility to jump over varying-size chunks of the input sUing. The goal is to fit the input with a closest matching parse structure while leaving the minimum number of words unaccounted for. In TIP, the skipping mechanism is implemented by adding extra productions for selected non-terminals, and these are always tried fast whenever the nonterminal is to be expanded. We illustrate this with rn productions covering fight adjuncts to a noun.","rn (SR, P) :-","timed out, !,","skip (SR), store (P) .","rn(_, []) :-","la ( [ [pdt, dt, vbz, vbp, vbd,","rod, eom, ha, rmr] ] ),","\\+is ( [ [C0~] , [wdt,wp,wps] ] ) .","rn(SR,P) :- rnI(SR, P). In the rn predicate, SR is the list of starter tags and P is the parse tree fragment. The first production checks if the time-out mode has already been entered, in which case the input is skipped until a starter tag is found, while the skipped words are stored into P to be analyzed later in the purser's second pass. Note that in this case all other rn productions are cut off; however, should the first skip-and-fit attempt fail to lead to a successful parse, backtracking may eventually force predicate skip(SR) to evaluate again and make a longer leap. In a top-down left to right parser, each input skipping location becomes potentially a multiple bucktracking point which needs to be controlled in order to avoid a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. This is accomplished by supplementing top-down predictions with bottom-up, data-driven fragmentation of input, and a limited lookahead. For example, in the second of the rn productions above, a right adjunct to a noun can be considered empty if the item following the noun is either a period, a semicolon, a comma, or a word tagged as pdt, dt, vbz, vbp, vbd, or md, but not a comma followed by a relative pronoun.~6",",2 In the present implementation, when the skipping mode is entered, it will stay on for the balance of the first pass in parsing of the current sentence. \"[~his way, o~¢ skip-and-fit attempt may lead to anc4her before any backtracking is considered.

ROBUSTNESS","TIP is a robust parser and it will process nearly every sentence or phrase, provided the latter is reasonably correctly tagged. 17 The lmrser robustness is further increased by allowing for a gradual degradation of its performance rather than an outright failure in the face of an unexpected input. Each sentence or phrase is attempted to be analyzed in up to four ways: (1) as a sentence, (2) as a noun phrase or a preposition phrase with a right adjunct(s), (3) as a gemndive clause, and if all these fail, (4) as a series of simple noun phrases, with each of these attempts allotted a fresh time slice) s The purpose of this extension is to accommodate some infrequent but still important constrnctions, such as dries, itemizations, and lists. 6. DISCUSSION","In this paper we described TIP, a fast and robust parser for natural language. In the experiments conducted with various text collections of more that 50 million words the average parsing speed recorded was approx. 0.5 sec/sentence. For example, the total time spent on parsing the CACM-3204 collection was less than 1.5 hours. In other words, TIP can process 100,000 words in approximately 45 minutes, and it could parse a gigabyte of text (approx. 150 million words) in about 40 days, on a 21 MIPS computer.","The parser is based on a wide coverage grammar for English, and it contains a powerful skip-and-fit recovery mechanism that allows it to deal with unexpected input and to perform effectively under a severe time pressure. Prior to parsing, the input text is tagged with a stochastic tagger that assigns part-of-speech labels to every word, thus resolving lexical level ambiguity.","TIP has been used as front-end of a natural language processing component to a traditional document-based information retrieval system (Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992). The parse structures were further analyzed to extract word and phrase dependency relations which were in turn used as input to various statistical and indexing processes.
