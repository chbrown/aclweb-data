This has led tn a bulk of work dealing with varinus forms of cohesimt-preserving language mechanisms, lnainly in the field of anaphora, which contribute to connectivity among sentences. From the focus on these linguistic phenomena one might obtain a misleading picture of textual connectivity, viz. one that considers it basically as a 'fiat', continuous streanl of formally connected utterances lacking additional structure. Far less research has been devnted to the intemM organization of cohesive utteranccs by mechanisms at a more global level of dialog/text architecture, the level of text coherence.","Major computational approaches rclated to co-. herence aspects within a dialog processing framework am due to Reichman's [1978], McKcown's [19851 and Scha & Polmlyi's [19881 lbnnalizations of diatog grammars.

A second major methodok)gy which deals with the global stnactufing of written texts is the model nf text lnacro propositions and superstnlcturns [Kintsch & wm Dijk 1978, van Dijk 19801, tilt latter sharing all relevant pmtxmies one generally altriDutes to story grammars [Runlelhari 19']51. The problem with this kind of methodology is that, unlike the coherence relation approach, the grammat,'s which have been proposed so far are litirly idiosyncnttic 10r each application dmnain (narratives, weather reports, etc.). Cornmolt to all these approaches is the requirement of a deep, propositionally guided understanding of the underlying discourse; in particular, a complete theory o1' its dontain and an exhaustive specifieatitm of a natural language grammar must be supplied in order to guaraw tee proper operation of implemented systelns.

It operates ht a i~al.world doruain [Reimer & ]tahu 19881, i.e. textual input is taken fl'onl a t)crnlallcnt stream of test reports in major (;ennan in fomladon technology magazines. As it seems that it will remain iu/'easible for a long time to come to provide exhaustive dt)tuain and grammar si~cilications lor routinely operating text understmulers, a palticularly robust partialpwwing approach capable o['handlinp potential specilication gaps has lreen adopted. These conditions obvkmsly preclude tile consideration of RST-style co hercnce relation COlUl)uting as a text coherence analysis stlategy, since relevant knowledge pmtions might be lacking lbr deteonming specific instances of coherence relations. Conversely, the coherence lelatiou appnlach seems currelflly itffeasiMe for tile rotlthle processing ol large-scale text collections in real donlaios.

As TOPIC is rather weak with re spool to lull-blown asseltiolm[ knowledge, coherelicc relation etm~puting, however valuable it might be, is currently out of reach for this systenl. Fortunately, Daues-type coherence t)allerns primarily t'eli:r to the level of tenninological knowledge.

OF COI,ING 92, NANTES, Aut;. 23-28, 1992 collected empirical evidence for this claim through in-vestigations of texts from diverse domains [Giora 1983a, Kurzon 1984]. This coincides with the general-ity of use of most coherence relations, but is in sharp contrast to the highly constrained and domain-depend-ent model of superstructures and story grammars. (4) Major thematic progression pattems are correlated with particular search styles and retrieval modes in full-text information systems. Hence, providing typed coherence operators inherently supports graphics-based user interactions with the TOPIC system in terms of advanced conceptual orientation and navigation tools for semantically guided text graph tours (see section 5.3). (5) The investigation of thematic progression pattems is of value in its own methodological right. They constitute a basic structural model of text macro organization as opposed to model-theoretic and plan/goal-based approaches (a distinction made by Pustejovsky [1987]). As such they might complement current text understanding methodologies whose emphasis, so far, has been on fairly knowledge-expensive assertional models (such as coherence relations and text macro propositions) or stereotyped text-semantical models (such as superstructures and story grammars). 2 MOTIVATING THE NEED FOR TEXT","COHERENCE PARSING Tbe model of text structure parsing we propose draws a careful distinction between text cohesion and text coherence phenomena. As to the illustration of text cohesion mechatfisms in natural language texts, consider the following text passage:","[1] The De/taX from ZetaMachineslnc. is a computer","system that mns Unix V.3.","[21 ~h.e_Lw[9~ is based on a 68020 processor.","[3] It has a 12-inch monochrome display and an integrated","telephone handset and built-in modem.","[4] Internally, there's a 40-megabyte hard disk, a 1.2-","megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive, 4.5 megabytes","of RAM, three RS-232C ports, and an S T-506 port. Repeated occurrences of various text cohesion phenomena are illustrated by nominal anaphora (7\"he system' in [2]), pronominal anaphora ('/t' in [3]), both referring to the unique antecedent Delta-X (in [1]), while '/nternally, there's a ... hard disk\" (in [4]) is linked to Delta-X via textual ellipsis. The basic cohesion among these sentences yields the common thematic background for constantly elaborating on a single topic (Delta-X). An appropriate text parser should, first of all, recognize these multiple cohesion phenomena and produce something like the following representation structures (indicated by [...]R):","II]R l)elta-X < manufacturer: { ZetaMachines Inc. } > Delta-X < operating system: { Unix V,3 } >","[21R Delta-X < CPU: { 68020 } >","13}R Delta-X < peripheral devices: { 12-inch monochrome display } > Delta+X < peripheral devices: { telephune handset ] > Delta-X < e~tmunication devices: { modem } >","14]R Delta-X < external storage devices: { 40-megabyte hard disk } > Delta-X < external storage devices:","{ 1.2-megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive } > Delta-X < main memory: { 4.5 megabytes of RAM } > Deha-X < ports: { 3 RS-232C ports } > Deha-X < ports: { ST-506 port } >","Ac'r~!s DE COLING-92, NArcl'l~s, 23-28 AoC-r 1992 26 What is still lacking is a representation facility which characterizes this sequence of single assertions constantly referring to a single topic (Delta-X) as constitut-ing a coherent whole. Recognizing linguistic forms of text coherency and providing appropriate thematic grouping operators for text knowledge bases is what text coherence parsing mainly is about. Even if parsers would perfectly recognize and normalize all occurrences of text cohesion phenomena in texts, missing recogni-tion capabilities for text coherence phenomena would nevertheless produce under-structured, incoherent text knowledge bases in the sense that global pragmatic in-dicatops of discourse bracketing would be lacking. 3 BASIC TEXT COHERENCE PATTERNS In this section, we informally describe the basic patterns of text coherence focused on in this paper. According to Danes [1974] three categories of thematic developments can be distinguished:","~1 Constant Theme. This pattern is characterized by the con.~tant elaboration of one specific topic within a text (passage) by considering several of its conceptual facets. The following two paragraphs serve to illustrate this major pattern of thematic progression (the reference points to the constant theme (Delta-X) are indicated by italics): [TI.ll. The Delta-X from ZetaMachineslnc. is a multiuser, multitasking computer system that runs Unix V.3 and comes complete with most of the software needed for business applications. The combination host computer/workstation is based on a 68020 processor, with dual 68000 processors providing peripheral processing. It has a 12-inch monochrome display andan integrated telephone handset and built-in modem.","Internally, there's a 40-megabyte hard disk, a 1.2-megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive, 4.5 megabytes of RAM, a network controller, three RS-232C ports, and an ST-506 port.","7] Continuous Thematization of Rhemes. In contrast to constant themes, this pattern realizes a continuous shift of topics (visualized by bold italics). The process starts with a theme and ,some comment on that theme which we shall call theme (actu- • ally, an elaboration on one of its conceptual facets). Now this rheme is focused on as the next theme that is elaborated by a corresponding rheme, etc.: IT1.2]. The $12,000 Delta-X host/workstation can be supplied from ZetaMachines Inc.. 2999 State St., Santa Barbara, CA 93105. Zeta-Machines\" sales manager, Brian Wilson, says that they also plan to market the Gamma-Z, a CAD/CAM workstation based on a Connection Machine architecture. The underlying theoretical foundations are due to D. Hillis, a former M.I.T. student who first developed an experimental prototype based on connectionist principles. Derived Theme. Global text structure can also be introduced by a variety of topics which share conceptual commonalities (facets) at the knowledge repreSelltation level (not necessarily need this be paralleled with properties actually mentioned in the text!) without the general concept being explicitly stated in the text. Technically this is realized by a set of sub-","PROC. Cq: COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 ordinates or instances of a common (only implicit) supcrordinate/prototype. Suppose the iUuslrative text ITI] composed of its two constituent parts from above, [T1.1 ] and [T1.2], is augmented by ~vel~d paragraphs dealing with Gamma-Z and Sigma-P machines on a similar level of detail as those passageswlfichcor~sidertheDelta-X in [TII: [T21.

This text implicitly has workstation as a derived lhemc, since that is the immediate prototype concept of those three instauees (Delta-X, Gamma-Z, S igma-P) explicitly menlioned in [T 2]. 4 TIlE KNOWLEDGE SOURCES","INVOINED IN TEXT PARSING This section deals with the .knowledge sources involved in actually parsing a text. Basically (see Figure 1), these are constituted by the PARSE BULLETIN, a blackboard-type memory which records the single events of the parsing process, the DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE, which contains file domain-specific background knowledge needed for the parse, and various EXPER~Ps for actually driving the parse through the text grammar specifications they incorporate (cf. tlahn [1990] for a more comprehensive presentation).","The PARSE BULLETIN has a flat list struc. ture. It records the sequence of text tokens as they appear in the text and, if relevant (see below), notes their class identifiers (FRAME item, ADJective, etc.). More imlxmant, cox~structivc parsing activities based on operations of the knowledge base and the parser are indicated at ~ver',d positions (so-called parse points) in the PARSE BULLETIN. The type of operation being performed is indicated by a particular parse descriptor. Some are internal to the management of the knowledge base, e.g., DEFACF (default concept activation), while others indicate grammatical relations recognized by tile parser, such as NounA'Vl' (conccptu~d attribution relations between nouns), AdjA'FI' (conceptual attribution relations between adjectives and nouns). The items alZ lcctcd by an operation lorm a so-called parse mple.","The parser does not consider every token it re-ceives from the input text at the same level of detail. Instead, it distinguishes between words which am signilicant to its performance (conceptually relevant ones, such as nouns or arljcctives which denote concepts in the domain knowledge base, or linguistically relevant ones, such as negation particles, certain conjtmctions, quantiliers, etc.), and tho~ that are not (anrong them a wide variety of semantically indifferent nouns, verbs, particles, etc., each of which is assigned the class identifier NIL). The latter are simply discarded from further analysis, while the fom~er arc assigned lexicalized grammar spccificafiorts. The parser h~s thus been tuned towards partialparsing in a spirit similar to that advocated by Schank ct al. [19801 and achieves text understanding primarily on a terminological levcl of knowlcdge representation.

Instead of a full treatment, we give two rather informal sketches of the underlying regularities as they have been incorporated into our framework. Contitmous thematization of rhemes most significantly departs from the constant theme schema just outlined (in fact, both are mutually exclusive) in that the former incorporates a continuous shift of the topics being considered. Figure 4 illustrates this permanent change of issues in a text. The PARSE BULLETIN contains a sequence of local theme-theme pairs withframeTi being tile current local theme and slotftllerTi being its associated local rheme. Text coherence is due to the fact that the current local theme (slotfillerTi) becomes the next local theme (framerl+l). This rheme-specific connectivity criterion is stressed by the double-sided black arrows in the DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE which link the immediately preceding theme to its identical theme succes-Acrl~.s DE COLlNG-92, NAM'ES, 23-28 ho~r 1992 3 0 sor, while local theme-theme connections are indicated by the one-sided grey arrows which go l~om the local theme to its associated local tl~eme. A sequence of local theme-theme pairs fulfilling the rheme-specilic conuectivity criterion in terms of overlapping palmneters (current rheme becomes next theme) constitutes what is Item called continuous thematization of rhemes, i.e. a g/oba/theme-theme cluster.

Evidence for this comes from our experiments with TOPOGRAPHIC, an interactive graphical interface to TOPIC's text knowledge ba~s [Thiel & Hammwhhner 1987]. In particular, we observed a close funclional relationship between the selection of particular coherence patterns and particular search states during the retrieval process which is performed on network representations of text summaries, so-called text graptLs: 1) Constant Theme coherently characterizesavariety of facts related to one particular topic. A CT-based search operation enhances the user ~ knowledge of that topic by presenting facets (or data related to those facets) the user is probably not aware of, although they may be relevant to the solution of his or her problem. 2) Continuous Thematization of Rhemes linlc,;a set of formerly unrelated topics by a coherent line of conceptual dependencies (cunent rheme becomes next theme). A CTR-based search operation therefore provides the basis for thettuaical g~sociations and stim-AOI\"ES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~I' 1992 3 1 ulates previously unconsidered lines of reasoning by thematically cotL~trained browsing. 3) Derived Theme g,~oups hierarchically related topics and thus may enhance the knowledge of alternatives of the particular topic (,and facts related to it) under focused attention of the user (by way of stimulating comparisolts, recognizing int0rmation gaps, etc.). 6 FINAl, REMARKS In this paper, a structural model of text coherence com~ putation has been proposed that strongly exploits the knowledge chunking inherent to fi~ame representations.
