Moreover, the distance between the language pair is great, the possibilities of the transfer diverse and it would be difficult to guarantee the equivalence of translation. In this article, we propose a method of utilizing domain and language specific constraints from the view~ point of transfer phase in a dialogue translation system. q~ansfer processing sometimes requires various kinds of information: e.g., domain knowledge for ellipsis resolution, language dependent communicative structures(focus, theme, rheme, ...). Our standpoint is that there are certain language specific strategies on producing utterances in communication. As steps towards clarifying those stratcgies, we first discuss tim issue of typical idiosyncratic gaps between two language pairs. Next, to resolve such problems we suggest a new framework of incorporat-ing domain and language specific knowledge a.s transfer rides for dialogue translation from the viewpoint of transfer phase. Finally we will mention related issues and further investigation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The difficulty of translating spoken dialogues between two languages is often greater than that of translating written text. This is because translation of certain expressions in a source language are affected by previous context or couununicative goals tinder conllnon knowledge for dialogue participauts. If the two languages are quite different from each other, possible expression candidates increase. This further complicates tile problems of producing utterances in dialogue translation. In the author's recent work[12], tbe factors which affect lexical choices aud setting the default translation considering those factors were discussed for selecting appropriate verbs. Of course the selection of an appropriate verb in given situations is only a small part of the great theme of translation in various levels of expressiou: e.g., selection of modality correspond ing to illocutionary forces, correct choice of articles, etc. The problem, however, includes important aspects of linguistic phenomena related to other levels. In that article, some examples of relationships between Japanese and English verbs were investigated using a dialogue corpus translated by human interpreters. Through comparing corresponding verbs in Japanese and English, some tendencies were envisaged concerning the characteristics specific to dialogue translation. Ill another work[13/, we discussed the issue of translating dialogue utterances through a partitioned semantic network, part of which is actually lexicalized. A method was proposed for managing the semantic network, i.e. re-partitioning of the network, which yields a more natural translation of utterances. We assumed three kinds of partitions: theme vs. theme, old vs. new information, and fore- vs. back-ground. The prodncing of target utterances starts with proceasing along the lines suggested by the source language, and then the given partition can be repartitioned according to properties of the target language. Along this examination, we started to describe actual transfer rules for certain kinds of Japanese utterance that seem to be ditficult to translate directly into Euglish, because of lacking substantial words in Japanese. This is the background and the motivation of the current study. Our presuppositions are as follows. • The analysis of input utterances are lim-","ited in the source language. Basically, dctinite/indetinite or plural/singular markers are not indicated in Japanese explicitly. Moreover, various kinds of arbitrary/obligatory ellipses of subjects/objects/predicates (occasionally) are difficult to resolve within sentential in-tormation. • A translbr processing is perfomned between lal~guage dependent feature structllres. The analysis module outputs a. feature structnre, which indicates the relationships between predicates and their complements and other information including some pragmatic features.

Those complements are often eliminated if they are already known as old information. When honorific expressions (respective, condescend, polite) are used, a certain kind of the ellipses (zero-pronouns referring the speaker or the hearer) can be resolved by using these key expressions in many cases. [I] However, there are another sort of utterances which lack substantial words and are difficult to understand individually. As a target of our examinations, we selected an expression called \"dr-expression\". Though there are a lot of variations for da-expressions[14], we consider one of their types that has a structure : Copula(A, B). It means that A and B is identical (in a certain sense). In many cases, we cannot translate such a dr-expression without knowing the context where the utterance is spoken.

In the previous example sentence J2, the substantial words are : sankaryou(fee) and ginkou-furikomi(bank-transfer).

And the word \"shiharau\" does not appear in J2, while it appeared in J1..12 is a typical da-expression (a kind of copula sentence) in Japanesefl[14] The Rheme 2 of the sentence J2 is obviously ginkoufurlkoml (bank-transfer) and it meets the focus of the previous question J1. Accordingly the utterance J2 satisfies the Grice's maxim of informativity. In English, however, we can't say \"The fee is hank-transfer.\" Wc have to elaborate the utterance with some substantial or functional words. Generally such kinds of knowledge for elaboration have been provided with domain knowledge which are commonly accessed by respective processing modules. We propose that the concept of Mel'~uk's lcxieal functions can be extended for designing special sets of domain-dependent lexieal functions.

You pay the fee by bank-transfer. lIowever, it is still unnatural because the speaker's intention doesn't appear in these sentences. There-fore another elaboration is needed for producing a more sophisticated utterance. The previous utterance J 1 is apparently a question that demands a value referred with the interrogative \"donoyouni\" (how).

The translation shonld also follow this rule, especially in ca.ue of the utterances by the secretary of the conference. It couhl affect the style of expressions. In faet, we found many 1N-FORM utternces really mean indirect REQUEST. The indirectness is remarkable in Japanese (using da-expressious) and a direet translation can be abrut)t or not informative, partly because there seems to be no polite copula expressions in Ellglish. Therefore, a certain transfer of IFT might be required. We have to consider some constraints for al)plying such a rule.

Some additional conditions can be described using if sentences. For referring a feature value, a feature path i~a tot~to-down direction can be used like as Input.Obje.Pred Note that the above mfle~ are partly modified for explanation using PSs instead of FSs. The explanation for the rules is described as follows, though the allowed space precludes the detail. The whole transfer process are composed of several sub-procedures according to the Rewriting Environmeats designated by the main rule (the top level rule). The general framework is as follows. First, the rewriting of ellipsis resolution process provides the missing zero-pronouns referring the speaker or the hearer. Then an Illocutionary Force Type is given to ttle top level of tile feature structure. After this a kind of normalization is performed (so called Japanese-to-Japanese transfer) in order to make the (Japanese-to-English) transfer easier. The processing of these sub-procedures are regarded as a pre-transfer phase. The main transfer phase contains 3 sub-procedures : idiomatic, general and default. The Rule-1 is an example of simple general transfer rules. After the main transfer phase, the transfer within the English feature structures is performed. The Rule-2 and the Rule-3 are applied in this phase. Using ttle Rule-2, a Copula predicate structure is transferred to another substantial predicate structure. When this rule is applied, a local parameter is set to the Rewriting Environment. After this, under the new RE the transfer of cases (e.g. lden -~ Mann) is carried out with another rewriting rule including domain knowledge. The Rule-3 designates a rewriting of IFT from IN-FORM to REQUEST under certain conditions. As mentioned in tile previous section, such a transfer yields a more natural utterance. At present the flexibility of the system is still in-sufficient from the viewpoint of context, processing. Iiowever, it is possible to control apllying rules by means of local parameter setting (like :status :complement), to a certain extent.","3.4 Other Examples and the current status The following examples were described as domain and language specific knowledge for translating typical \"da-expressions\" that appear in our target dc~ maim The frequency of \"da-expressions\" iu ATR Dialogue Database is as follows.
