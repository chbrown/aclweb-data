Nevertheless, restrictions can be defined on nominal modification because of certain correspondences between nominal modifiers and the role they fulfill in a statistical database, notably that the names of database tables and columns, and values of columns, are all determined by the modifiers. These restrictions are described. In-corporating these restrictions into Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) has caused us to examine the treatment of nominal modification in HPSG. A new treatment is proposed and an implementation within an HPSG based natural language front-end to a statistical database is described."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A prototype natural language front-end to statistical databases is being developed as part of an Executive Information System for Rogers Cablesystems, a Canadian cable television company. The initial target database is the Rogers Technical Operations Database, a relational database containing statistical data describing aspects of the company's business related to customer service. The front-end employs an HPSG chart parser. There axe numerous variations of HPSG; we have chosen [PS87] since it is the most familiar and widely published. Our results can be extended to other variations. In the spirit of HPSG, we have avoided a proliferation of grammar roles and kept them highly schematic. In developing the grammar for the queries in our corpus, we encountered a selection of interesting noun phrase constructions which caused us to examine the treatment of adjunct modification of nominals within HPSG. This has resulted in a proposal which should be of interest to other researchers developing natural language interfaces."]},{"title":"2 Complex NPs in Queries","paragraphs":["We began the project by collecting a corpus of 68 English language queries from three senior executives at Rogers. Our corpus contains constructions paradigmatic of a wide selection of natural language queries that the executives would like to pose to their database. A selection of these queries are shown in (1-6). (1) Give me the we.stem region outage log summary. (2) Give me the system reliability performance. (3) Compare the basic service problem statistics per","thousand customers. (4) Compare the terminal equipment problems. The sentences contain complex NP constructions and there is a large amount of variation with respect to the location and ordering of the modifiers. For example, most pre-nominal modifiers may also appear as post-nominal modifiers. (5) Vancouver system reliability performance (6) system reliability performance for Vancouver Prepositional phrases like for Vancouvercan be viewed as an abbreviated form of the prepositional phrase for the Vancouver division. The NPs within these sentences contain a great deal of syntactic ambiguity. Consider the complex NP in (1). The adjective western can either modify region or outage or log or summary. Similarly, region could modify any of the nominals appearing to its right. However, much of this syntactic ambiguity does not ACRES DE COLING-92. NANTES, 23-28 AOt3\"r 1992 4 6 I'ROC.

It employs attribute value matrices (called signs) to represent lexical entries, grammar rules and principles. HPSG borrows freely from other formalisms. For example, the treatment of syntactic categories, syntactic features, and sonre of the principles are from generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) [GKPS85]. The main syntactic categories in HPSG are heads (the head constituents of phrases), adjuncts (traditionally called modifiers) and complements (traditionally called arguments). The principles of HPSG include the Constituent Order Principle, Subcategorization Principle, Head Feature Principle, and Semantics Principle. HPSG contains three grammar rules for combining heads with complements. (7) [SUBCAT ([ ])] --, H[LEX+, INV-], C\""]},{"title":"(8) [SUBCAT( )] ~ a[LEX-], C","paragraphs":["(9) [SUBCAT( )] --, H[LEX+, INV +], C* One rule (7) combines a lexical head with everything but its final complement. This rule can also be used to convert a lexical head requiring only a single complement into a non-lexical constituent still requiting a single complement. Another rule (8) combines a non-lexical head with its final complements. Yet another rule (9) works for inverted constructions: those involving a lexical head that is marked for inversion. As in GPSG, generalizations about the relative order of sister constituents is factored out of the phrase structure rules and expressed in independent linear precedence (LP) constraints. The LP constraints are used by the Constituent Order Principle. HPSG roles are immediate dominance (ID) rules. Consequently, a single ID rule of the form X --, HA could describe a head constituent H either preceded or followed by an adjunct A -- the relative ordering of H and A is determined by the LP constraints."]},{"title":"3.2 Issues in the Treatment of Adjuncts","paragraphs":["Nominal modification is treated ill HPSG by having heads that contain a set valued feature called ADJUNCTS [PS87]. Each element of this set is a sign which describes a potential adjunct. For instance, the ADJUNCTS feature for a noun will contain an entry for adjectives, one for nouns, one for prepositional phrases and one for verb phrases. An alternative, which was also discussed in [PS87] and has been adopted in other grammar formalisms (e.g., [Usz86, CKZ88]) and some variations of HPSG [Coo90, Po191], is to allow adjuncts to select their heads, t The head feature called HEADS contains a set of descriptions, one for each construction that can be modified by the adjunct. For example, the HEADS feature for an adjective will contain a sign for a noun. In our corpus, a head has more possible classes of modifiers than modifiers have classes of possible heads. For example, the set of modifiers for NPs and Ns (i.e., NPs lacking determiners) includes adjectives, nominals, PPs and even VPs (relative clauses). In §3.4 we shall see that each of these modifiers can have only one or two possible heads. Furthermore, the task of reducing the size of the HEADS or ADJUNC'rS set, by discovering common semantic features for which a constituent can select, meets with greater success if modifiers select their heads. That is, one is more likely to find commonality among the constituents which an adjunct can modify than among the modifiers which a head can take. Selections of heads by adjuncts permits a greater range of subcategorization to be specified through default inheritance rather than explicit specification. Some aspects of adjunct semantics arc impossible if adjuncts are selected by heads rather than heads selected by adjuncts. Predicates, both adjectives and verbs, have argument structure which coerces their arguments into thematic roles. For exanlple, the adjective modern imposes on its argument the thematic role of Theme. ~ It is not obvious how the nonrinal argument of the adjective receives its thematic role unless it is the adjective which selects the nominal, parallel to the assignment of thematic roles by verbs to their NP arguments. If modern selects its head, then the the° matic role of the head may be specified in the HEADS","I Cooper ICoo90, Ch.3, §6] looks in some detail at the arguments in favour of adjuncts selecting their heads.","2In [Po191, §1.3], Pollard and Sag introduce semantic features like AGENT, GOAL andTHEME within the feature structure containing the semantic CONTENT.

That is, for lexical adjuncts which have empty subcategorization lists, like adjectives, proper nouns (specifically, the proper nouns corresponding to months and cities) and adverbs. The rule will be restricted so that it will apply to phrases with unsaturated heads. Heads that fall into this category are Ns, PPs, 3 VPs, and APs. The specific pairing of adjuncts to heads is determined by the HEADS feature of the adjunct (§3.4). Additionally, if the head modified by the adjunct is marked [LEX +] then the resulting constituent will also be [LEX +}, thus implementing the analysis of adj-noun and noun-noun constructions discussed in the previous section. Using the schematic notation for grammar rules introduced in [PS87], we can present the rule as shown in (11).","(11) [SUBCAT([]), LEX [~]] --+ H[LEX E]], A[SUBCAT (), LEX +, HEADS {...H...}] Note that the two appearances of [] in (11) indicate that the head and the resulting constituent share the same value for their LEX features. The Subcategorization Principle will ensure that the head and the resulting constituent will have the same value for their SUBCAT features. Since the grammar rule is an ID rule, it does not place any restriction on the linear ordering of the head (H) and adjunct (A). This rule is designed so that it applies before a head is combined with its final complement (8). It can be viewed as the HPSG counterpart to the adjunct rule from X-bar theory [Cho82] shown below, where the"]},{"title":"ADJUNCT","paragraphs":["is required to be lexical and not subcategoriz, e for any arguments.

A PP is obtained by combining a preposition with its object NE We do not propose lexical entries for prepositions having only the object NP on its SUBCAT list since this would complicate the LP roles (~3.5) and grammar rules (7) and (8).

NAI'rrEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 Rule (13) requires the adjunct to have a single element in its SUBCAT list, thus allowing PR VP and","modiliers to modify PPs, VPs and Ns. Of course, the contents of the HEADS feature will restrict the applicabillty of this role (fi3.4). Unlike rule (11) which allowed a lexical adjunct to modify either a lexical or non-lexical head, rule (13) requires the head, adjunct and resulting constituent to possess the same values for their LEX features, as reflected by the coindexing wilh [j_-]. With this role, a \"lexical\" compound noun can modify a lexical noun to yield a \"lexical\" compound noun (e.g., N -~ N, N), or a (non-lexical) PP can nmdify a non-lexical nominal m yield a non-lexical nonrinal (N -~ N, PP). Direct consequences of our two adjuncts ndes are that prepositions and verbs are not allowed to modify anything (these have two or nrore elements in their SUBCAT lists), sentences or complex noun phrases cannot appear as adjuncts, and NPs, Ss, adjectives, verbs and prepositions cannot be modi fled by anything. Our grammar does not prevent nouns from being modified, since rule (7) can be applied to a lexical noun to yield a non-lexical nominal (essenti',dly, N ~ N). If we \"allowed full NPs or Ss to be modified, the result would be a syntactic ambiguity which would not have any semantic relevance. 3.4 The HEADS Feature The applicability of the two adjuncts grammar roles is restricted by the value of the HEADS feature of the adjunct. For prepositions (lexical entries with SYNILOCIHEADIMAJ = P), the value of the HEADS feature will be a set containing a sign for N constituents (N[SUBCAT ([]), LEX-]) and a sign for VP constituents. 4 Lexical entries for nouns and adjectives will have a single element in their HEADS set. It will contain a sign for lexical nouns, which inchtdes compound nouns (N[SUBCAT ([ ]), LEX +]). We are proposing that pre-nominal lnodifiers, like adjectives and (compound) nouns, will be combined with their head nouns before post-nominal modifiers, like PPs. We adopted this decision because applying modifiers in different orders does not result in any difference in the resulting semantic interpretation. Specifically, the semantic representation associated with"]},{"title":"[the [lsystern reliability]","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"Vancouverl]","paragraphs":["is the same as that","4In our corpus PPs do not appear to nlodify any VPs, so we can actually simplify the HEADS feature so that it contains only the N entry. for"]},{"title":"[[the [system mliabilityl]","paragraphs":["lot"]},{"title":"Vancouverl and [the Isystem [reliability tbr Vancouverlll.","paragraphs":["With our proposal, we obtain only one analysis tot the phrase discussed alx~ve. Finally, in order to allow relative clauses (MAJ=V), we need only propose that they contain a sign for N in their HEADS set. Ttms, we effectively treat relative clauses like"]},{"title":"restrictive","paragraphs":["relative clauses. As was the case with PP adjtmcts, the same semantic representation is obtained regardless of whether the relative clause modifies an N (restrictive relative) or an NP (non-restrictive relative). 3.5 Linear Precedence We adopt the same LP constraints for heads and complement danghters as proposed in [PS87]. Lexical heads are required to precede their cmnplement(s), while non-lexical heads tollow their complement(s). Sister cmnplements appear in the reverse order of their appearance in tim SUBCAT list of flmir head. The I,P constraints lot adjuncts require signs with MAJ-A or MAJ:N (+N categories in terms of the chtssification present in [Cho821) to precede their beads, while adjuncts with MAJ=V or MAJ=P (-N categories) are required to follow their heads. Thus adjectives and nominal modifiers will precede the nouns they modify, while PPs and relative clauses will follow the constituenls they modify. 3.6 Semantics Due to the close relationship between syntax and semantics in HPSG, we can avoid syntactic ambiguities which do not con'espond to distinct semantic analyses. Semantic infomlation, consisting n fTYPE and content (CONT), can be used to prevent ceIl.ain analyses. The TYPE of a complex constituent will be tbe san~e as that of its head. The Semantics Principle is responsible for creating the CONT of a complex constituent from that of its daughters (suhconsfituents) [PS871.
