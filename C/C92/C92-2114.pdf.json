Introduction","paragraphs":["Lexical choice cannot be made dining text generation wifltottt taking into account the linguistic context, both the lexical context of inmmdiately surrounding words and rite larger textual context. a) Lexical context consists of the words (or lather, the lexicnl specifications of nascent words) that enter into syntactic relations with the lexical item being generated. This intrn-clausal context is crncial lor lk)rmnlating collocational constraints, which restrict ways of expressing a preci~ meaning to certain lexical items, lot example as in expressions like pay attention, receive attention or narrow escape.

Varieties of lexical anapbora","paragraphs":["Beft)re reviewing conshaints on tile introduction of lexical anal)hera during generation, we give examples of inlportant tYlmS of cm'eferential anaphoric links 4. We consider an anallher 10 13(3 lexical only if we can establish a semantic link between the attaphor and its antecedent. Therefore, in the following example:","(3) Edith Cresson arrived Monday ut 9:00. At 11:00, the Prbne Miniater of France gave a pxess conference. 4) We will not treat here non -comlErantial anaphora like: Marie threw away all her old dre~es because she wanted to buy lleV¢ Ollt2S. ActTzs DE COLING-92, NANTt'S, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 7 6 3 l'rttx:. OF COLIN(;-92, NAt, arES, AU(;. 23-28, 1992 Prime Minister of France is a cognitive coreferential anaphor of Edith Cresson, but not a lexical one because the coreferential link between the two phrases is based on world knowledge, and not on linguistic semantics. One type of coreferential lexical anaphora is called \"reiteration\" by Halliday & Hasan (1976) with three subtypes: exact repetition, illusWated by (4b), synonym substitution (4b'), and superordinate substitution (4b\"). We can add to this group partial repetition (4b\"'):","(4) a. 1 bottle of light red bordeaux. b. Pour the light red bordeaux on the meat. b'. Pour the lieht red bordeaux wine on the meat. b\". Pour the ~ oct the meat. b'\". Pour the ~ on the meat. Nominalization provides another way of introducing a coreferential link to a previous verb:","(5) Cook the rabbit for two hours. Ten minutes before the end of cooking, add the spices.","Coreferential lexical links can also be established between an action and its result.","(6) Meanwhile. mix the egg yolki with the sugarj. Pour the milk on the mixturei+ j. In this example, mixture has no direct semantic link with its antecedents egg yolk and sugar. The link appears indirectly through the verb mix.","Another type of lexical anaphora occurs with nouns denoting typical actants of an antecedent verb:","(7) Marga i was lecturing to third year students k. The lecturer i was very interesting and the audience k quite attentive. In this case, lecturer is linked coreferentially with Marga because it is the \"agent noun\" of lecture, while audience is the corresponding \"patient noun\", and is coreferential with third year students. These examples illustrate some of the diversity of lexico-semantic resources needed to build coreferential links in text. Text generation therefore requires a lexicon which gives access to the full range of such resources from the \"viewpoint\" of the antecedent lexeme. As seen in the next section, LFs provide an appropriate access mechanism for choosing the correct anaphor."]},{"title":"2. Lexical Functions of the ECD for creating lexical anaphora","paragraphs":["Lexical Functions of the ECD provide a formalism representing many common instances of coreferential anaphora. Formally defined, a Lexical Function f is a correspondence between a lexical item L, called the key word of f, and a set of lexical items f(L) - the values of f (Mel'~uk & Zholkovskij 1970, Mel'~uk 1988b). Approximately sixty standard Lexical Functions have been defined (for a recent description of LFs in the ECD in English, see Mel'~uk & Polgu~re 1987). They can be divided into two subsets: syntagmatic LFs and paradigmatic LFs. - Syntagmatic or collocational LFs are used to link unpredictable lexical cooccurrences in texts between the key word and its values through a specific semantic relation. Typical examples of syntagmatic LFs are Oper i (semantically empty verb which takes the i-th arrant 5 of the key word as its subject and the key word as its direct object), like Operl(attention) = pay, Oper2(attention) = receive or Magn(escape) = narrow. These examples show that these LFs convey eooccurrence relations. -Paradigmatic LFs are used to express semantic relations in the lexicon between the key word of the LF and its values, but not cooccurrence relations. Typical examples are Sl(lecture ) = lecturer (Sl:Noun of the first typical actant), Sloc (box) = ring (Sloc: Noun of typical place), So(buy) = purchase (So: Derived noun). Some paradigmatic LFs can be used to analyse or generate lexical coreference relations: - Syn: synonym - ConvUkl: conversive - aener: generic word - St: typical noun for the i-th actant - Slratr: noun for typical instrument - Sm~: noun for typical means - Site: noun for typical place - Sr~: noun for typical result - Stood: noun for typical mod~ - S a : name of action Syn(callhlg) = vocation Conv32 t 4(sell) = buy Gener(apple) = fruit SI (lecture) = lecturer Sinsn(palnt) = brush Smed(ltolsalt ) = salt Slo~(box) ~ ring S~(mix) = mixture Stood(write) = writing S0(buy ) = purchase","Relations encoded by these LFs can appear in direct eoreferential relations in texts when the value of the function and the key word maintain a semantic relationship directly formalizable through a LF such as Sres, Gener, Syn and Convijkl, as in:","(8) Gener(lamb) = meat Buy lamb. Be sure the meat is very fresh.","LFs can be used to formalize indirect iexieal coreference when coreference exists between lexical items and a dependent. The dependent may be an actant as in (7) (lecturer, the Sl(lecture) is coreferential with the fn'st actant Marga of lecture whereas audience, the S2(lecture) is coreferential with the second actant of lecture), or an adverbial, as in the following example:","(9) Sloc(patiner ) = patinoire Marguerite et Jean ant patin6 sur le canali Rideau. Cene patinoire i fait 8km de long. [Marguerite end Jean skated on the Rid~au Canal. This \"skating rink\" is 8 km long.] In (9), patinoire, Sloc(patiner) is coreferential with canal Rideau. Moreover, LFs can be combined, as we see in the following table: 5)In the ECD, lecture will be described as a noun which has three syntactic actants: X's (actant I) lecture to Y (arrant II) on Z (arrant III), for example Jean's (actant I) lecture to third year students (actant II) on semantic causality (actant I1]).

Thus, So(Conv3214(aeheter)) = Conv3214(So(acheter)) = vente but Gener(So(acheter)) ~ S0(Gener(acheter)) because Gener(acheter) does not have a value. - Some compositions are reducible. For example, the LF Syn plays a transparent role in composition. In the perspective of text generation, this formalism appears very interesting for building coreferential expressions. To point back to a referent already introduced, LFs and compositions of I,Fs offer many possible ways for lexicalizing a given relerent. For example, let us suppo~ that after having introduced the following sentence, (10) a. L~fisser &uver laviande. [Let the meat stema.] we have to refer again to the action la viande Ftuve. We could try to use a noutinalization (So). But, as fltere is no nominalization for the verb Ftuver, we could use instead the nominalization of the generic term, So(Gener(dtuver)) = cuisa~n. We could thus produce the following sentence:","(11 ) b. A la fin de la cuisson, ajouter les cpiees [At tile end of cooking, add the spices] In the next section, we will examine the case of a complex lexical anaphor: file superordilmte term. 3. Superordinates and basic nouns The use of superordinate terms as anaphors raises several interesting questions. First, to the extent that a generic concept (for two or more specific concepts) has a simple expression in a language, this is not necessarily the same term as the superordinate term (for the term corresponding to the specific concepts). For example, from a conceptual point of view, knife and scissors are \"cutting instruments\". Nevertheless, it is not possible to naturally stthstitute cutting instrument for knife and scissors, as in:","(12) a. Use a knife mid scissors to cut up the duck, b.? If you don't have these cutting instruments, pull the","duck apart. ACIES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~f 1992 7 6 5 There is no consistently used term 12tr expressing tile generic concept of knife or scissors. ~lltis can be cutting instruments as well as instruments for cutting or cutting utensils. Whether or uot such a teNll exisLs varies among lauguages. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, file term d~o is fidly accepted as a superordinate term to point to the Chinese equivalents of knife aml scissors. Ill English, a term like vegetable is the superordiuate of carrot, tomalo Or cucumber because it is consistently used for tlte~ previous words in texts. This entails that choice of snperordinate terms as lexical auaphors cannot be made at tile conceptual level alone. Moreover, saperordinate terms call often bc: lnorc easily nsed to lexiealize reference to a uon-homegeueous set of elements than for reference to a single element or homogcueous ~t, as illustrated in (13) and (14):","(13) a. Put tile carrots ill to boiling water. b. ? Remove the vegetables after l0 mimnes.","(14) a. Throw the carrots, the leeks altd Ihe lx~tatoes in to","boiling water. b. Remove tile vegetables after l0 minutes. However, the ease with which a snperordinale can be used depends ou rite particular noun. For example, in French, viande [meatl can be snbsituted for bleuf Ibeefl even ill singular:","(15) a. Menre le b~euf h cuire dmls l'eau I~ouillante. IPut the t~_ef in the I~iling waterl b. Retirer la viande ml bout de 20 minutes. [Remove the meat aftc'r 20 minutes] This somewhat suri)rising i)henomenon can be analysed with the help of the notion of basic level object proposed by Roseh et al. (1976). The imlx)rtance of the basic level distinction for text generation has recently been shown by Reiter (1990). Rosch et al. demonstrated that the taxonomy of concepts could be organized using a stnlcture with three levels: superordiuate, haste and subordinate. They define the basic level as follows: \"basic objects a~e the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in cmmnon, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class\" (Rosch et al. 1976: 382) It has been shown that lexemes correspomling to basic level objects seem to be the most natural terms to introduce referents already idcntified. For example, if one wants to refer to some champignons de Paris [button mushrootos], one would prctk:r to call them champignons [nmshrooms], provided that there is no potcntial amttiguity with auy other mushrooms. Champignons de Paris would sccm too specific in this context and vegetables would seem too vague. This choice is not made randomly: champignon is the noun corresponding to the highest basic level coucept to designate these objects. This would explain why in (15), one can refer to b~eufwith the superordinate viande. Nevertheless, rite notion of basic level object does not always seem well suited to explain phenomena such as that observed in (15). For example, it seems that the concept \"volatile\" [\"fowl\"] fits perfectly the four criteria given by Rosch. But, volatile [fowll does not seem a PROC. ol; C{1LIN(;-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 natural French term for referring to a chicken, particularly in the sublangtmge of recitees.","It is also problematic that the naming of basic level objects varies a great deal among languages. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, the most natural term to designate a knife when there is no ambiguity is the term d~o , which corresponds to \"cutting instrument\" in English. We could argue that conceptual representation differs with the mother tongue of the speaker (which is plausible, without joining the debate about language and thought) and that the lexicon reflects the conceptual views. Nevertheless, this position does not solve the problem of terms like volaille, a unuatural term for a basic level object. It is significant that this position creates practical problems for text generation: if conceptual representation is reflected too closely in the choice of lexemes, this representation cannot be used as an interliugua for multilingual generation or machine translation. In the light of this evidence, we have decidcd in favor of a strict theoretical separation between conceptual representation and lexical representation. We believe that an appropriate couceptual representation can be used for multilingual generation because it is a non linguistic generalization above specific lexical representations. We therefore distinguish the notion of basic level object, which belongs to cognitive science, from the notion of basic noun, which is a linguistic notion 6. We consider \"viande\" and \"volatile\" to be basic level objects while only viande is a basic noun.","For lexical choice in text generation, we thus have to distinguish two very different processes:","- Superordination should be used to introduce a noun which points back to a set of different nouns. This is the case in {carrots, leeks, cucumber} --> vegetables. This process obeys a principle of economy. - Basic denomination is used to introduce the most natural term for a given referent or a set of referents. This process obeys a principle of \"naturalness\": it introduces the most closely basic noun that corresponds to the concept to be lexicalized. Basic denomination is often used in texts like recipes: objects are first introduced with extreme precision and subsequently referred to with the basic term. 4. Knowledge sources for determining lexical anaphors","In the course of our work, we have proposed a series of algorithms for generating grammatical and lexical anaphora in procedural texts (Turin 1992). Contrary to lexical anaphora, grammatical anaphora makes use of closed lexical classes (determiners, pronouns and a few special verbs) as well as ellipsis. These algorithms are derived from an empirical study of French recipes, using a representative corpus of over 16,000 words. Recipes serve as a good prototype of procedural texts for assembling complex objects from parts. Even this modest corpus presents a wide variety of lexical and grammatical anaphora which are typical of assembly instructions. 6) Wierzbicka (1985) has shown in lexicographic descriptions that the nantes of (words for) basic level objects have special semantic properties.,","We describe below some of the knowledge sources and organization needed to generate lexical and grammatical anaphora. For lack of space, however, we leave out the model of state change management (needed to describe recipe ingredients being mixed together and transformed (Kosseim 1992)), a~ld the focus model used. 4.1 Input","We limit our scope to the linguistic part of generation; therefore, we assume that onr input is the ontput of a text planner, which has already grouped actions into discourse structures as proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and (Dale 1988), The input is thus a sequence of actions and states in which participants (ingredients, instruments and agent) are represented by indices. 4.2 Dictionary of concepts","The dictionary of concepts has been inspired by Nirenburg and Raskin 1987; concepts are mainly subdivided into actions or objects. We have added a category of properties, needed to describe relations between concepts (e.g., temporal limit) or attributes (e.g. size). Relations between concepts are isa, part-o for result, the latter one useftd in a domain where state changes are frequent. Thus, one can relate the action \"cut\" to the concept \"piece\" which is the result of \"cut\". The dictiouary of concepts is not a copy of the language and there are Concepts without any corresponding lexicalization. Taxonomic organization is fimetional and depends greatly on the field for which it has been established. In other words, our description of concepts has limited value outside the domain of recipes. 4.3 Dictionary of lexical entries","The representation of lexical entries is strongly infhlenced by tile ECD (Mel'~uk & Folgu&e 1987, Mel'~uk et al. 1988). Two parts of tile entry are particularly interesting for our topic: the semantic zone and the LF zone. The semantic zone contains four types of information: - Tile semantic field to which the lexeme belongs. For example, the verb simmer would have feature/cook/. - The mass/count feature. - The \"basicness\" feature, if the lexical item is a noun, indicates whether or not the noun is a basic noun. - The key word(s) for which the lexeme can be a value. For example, for the lexeme mixture, it will be stated that it is the Sres of mix. In the LF :,.one, we simply enumerate the values of the lexical item as a key word. For example, the entry for the verb hacher [chop] may contain, among many others, hachis (Sres(hacher)) and hachoir (Smed(hacher) ). 5, Constraints for generating anaphors","We now turn to the constraints which apply to the choice of grammatical or lexical anaphors during text generation. Our aim here is to generate the most appropriate anaphor with respect to the textual context. To determine what is appropriate, we have used an empirical approach, rather than appeal to general principles such as Gricean conversational maxims (see Reiter 1990a & Dale 1988 for use of these notions for lexical choice in text generation). A detailed ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 not'rr 1992 7 6 6 Paoc. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 examinatiou of our corpus of cooking recipes has sttowu that anaphora is not governed so muct, by sU'ict rnlcs as by tendencies. Thus, in a given context, a set of possible anaphors can \"compete\" for selection. When choosing from multiple possibilities we flavor ttte most \"economical\" anaphor, i.e., the due which conveys the least information 7.","Space limitations prevent a complete discussion of all factors required for an anaphor choice algorithm (see Tutin 1992). Here we give the most ilnporfant constrai,~ts on choice among the principal anaphoric devices s. The selection of an anaphoric device Ires two slages: • First, at choice is made among of grammatical devices (e.g. personal pronoun, verb complement ellipsis, coreferential definite NP, demonstrative NP). • Then, if a lexical NP has been chosen, the corrcct lexical eataphor is determined. 5.1 Grammatical anaphnrn The introduction of a given grammatical anaphor depends mainly on 4 kinds of paranmtcrs: a) the conceptual nature of referents, b) distance In antecedent and discourse structure, c) focaliz~'~tion and d) potential ambiguity. We briefly review these different parameters tor each type of grammatical anaphor: verbal complement ellipsis, persomtl prolmml, demonstrative NP, corefereutial definite NP. Verbal complement ellipsis as in the following exaraple is very widespread in recipes, and characteristic of procedural instructions in general. (16) Prepare the carrots, the celery and the asparagus. Cook in the boiling water and take O out after 10 minutes. Verbal complement ellipsis is generally used to designate a heterogeneous .set of objects, coutrary to personal pronouns. \"llm distance from the antecedent can be quite far bat focalization coustraints, in particular global focus - defined as the subset of the most salient items - play a determining role for the production of this anaphor.","A personal prononn must nalne an object or a set of similar objects. It is governed by very strong locality constraints (Hobbs 1978) and, as previously noted ill the literature, personal pronouns often mainlain the tlmntatic continuity (Van Dijk & Kintseh 1983), i.e. pronoun is the local focus (what the clause is about) of both the previous and the current clauses. In fact, local focus generally supplies enough information for the healrer to correctly interpret the pronoun (as emphasized by Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1983), even if it is morphologically ambiguous. Choice of a demonstrative NP does not depend ou the conceptual nature of the referent, which may be either the local focus or the global focus. Its contrastive functions with respect to personal pronouns and definite NPs are rather complex. Since demonstratives are 7) Anaphoric devices thus have a default (strict) order of priority for application. 8) We omit the realization constraints, such as the fact that certain verbs do not allow their complements to be pronominalized. infrequent in onr corpus, lbey are not treated furllter here.","Fur a definite NP, there is no conceptual iestriction on the refm'ent. A definite NP can be introduced at substaulial distance from its textual antecedent, and typically dnes not occl,r in the following clan.~, especially if the antecedent was the local focus of its clause and there is no potential ambiguity 9 . For each NP to be generated, potential ambiguity must be taken into account. This has to tlo with lexieal choice. For example, choice of an anlbignons NP such as & vin [the wiue] must be blocked if there is white wine and red wine in the context. The context in which the anaphoric NP must be distinctive depends on the annphor chosen: it is tile preceding sentence for demonstrative NP while, for definite NP, a larger context nmst be taken in account lO, 5.2 Lexical amlphoru We now tun, to the constraints on choice of lexical anaphoL When the grammatical mechanism chosen tklr exprc.ssing atnaphora involves a corellareutial (definite or den:tonstrative) lcxical NP, these c(mstraiuts conic into play to pick the most appropriate lexical form. The anaphoric lexical devices presented here for recipes constitute only a subset of those that conld appear in the language as a whole. Nevertheless, we hylX)thesize that the COl)ceptual and linguistic constraints governing their usage are generalizable to other kinds of text. Lexical anaphora differs significantly on this point from grammatical anaphora, whnse constraints, like discourse structure or focalization, vary greatly according to rite kiud of text. Therefilrc, while a giveu kind of text might use only a subset of possible lexieal auaphoric devices, these devices are governed by the mtme constraints in all kinds of texts. For exautple, typical result mention (m/x - -> mixture) is widespread in procedural texts but constradltS governing thCnl are tile same ill ally kind of lext. lu contrast, it appears that tile constraints governing usage of granlmalical anaphoric devices, anti even the devices thenlselves, are much more depenttent on the variety of text. Given that a lexica] NP has been chosen, as the general type of anaphoric device, two kinds of constraints, conceptual and linguistic, apply to select the the specific kind(s) of lexical aUalthora which may be nsed. In case of anthiguity, i.e. if file NP produced is not distinctive, addilional processing will t'.c requirexl. Conceptual Cmlslraittts concern mainly:","The state of the object . l,'or example, all object whose state is being transfonued by an action should be relcrenced via its resulting state. - Groupings of ohjects: is the referent to be generated a set of identical objects, a heterogenous set, a homogenous sct or a single element? A heterogenons set is composed of elements which just have no close 9) For example, die definite NP hi file second clause is ra)t very natural in French: Marie a rencontr6 un charcufier. ~_¢I f~it on tr~s bun pht&","[Marie met a porkbutcher. ~Ii~ makes very go~,d l~.l 10) For recipes, we use Date's (1988) proposal to take the whole text as context, since it is usually short.

AU¢;. 23-28, 1992 generic concepts in common, such as, { \"salt\" ,\"knife\" ,\"table\"}.","Linguistic constraints involve mostly the lexical form and relative order of the coreferential NPs that have been lexicalized in the preceding text. Therefore, we do take advantage of referents already lexiealized in the previous context (which must be stacked for being available when lexicalizing). The following properties are examined: - The linguistic form of antecedent NP: is it a single noun, a compound noun or a complex NP? - The existence of a lexico-semantic association for the antecedent like the generic term or the typical result (which can mostly be formalized through a LF). - The \"basicness\" of the head word of the antecedent NP. Ambiguity constraints are used to check if the lexicalization is not ambiguous. If a unique object or a set of identical objects can not be lexicalized in a non ambiguous way, we lexicalize it the same way it has been first introduced in the text (Initial strict repetition). We use this ad hoc strategy because first mention of a referent is generally the most accurate. Of course, this would not always be the minimal distinguishing description (Dale 1988), but as Reiter (1990a) points out, determining a minimal distinguishing description may require overly complex processing. In case of potential ambiguity for a set of heterogeneous objects, we use \"complex coordination\". With this process, we regroup first the first level superordinates and apply the other devices to the remaining list of objects 11.

We have showed that paradigmatic Lexical Functions are well suited for creating lexical coreferential links. We have also distinguished the selection tff superordinate term, which is used to point back to a set of different words, from selection of basic denomination, which is usetl to name in the most natural way a concept already introduced by a previous noun. A series of constraiuts has been formulated which can be implemented in an algorithm for selecting among natural grammatical and lexical anaphors in procedural texts. Most of these algorithms have been implemented by Kosseim 1992. The generator uses Prolog anti specifically Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to produce text. We find that determination of grammatical anaphom is more dependent on the genre and sublanguage than is lexical anaphora, which appears governed by fairly general constraints. However, morn work needs to be done to check these results in other precedural texts, and then more broadly in less similar text types, Also, it would be interesting to see to what extent anaphoric expressions share common constraints with deictic expressions for which the context of interpretation is not the previous text, but the extra-linguistic context~"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Guy Lapalme, Igor Mel'~uk, Alain Polgu~re, Marga Alonso Ramos and Xiaobo Ren for fruitful discussions and helpful suggestions.
