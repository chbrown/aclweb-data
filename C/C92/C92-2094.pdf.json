This paper provides a catalog of several types of distinctions among Spanish, English, and German, and describes a parametric approach that characterizes these distinctions, both at the syntactic level and at the lexical-semantic level.

This paper argues that, not only should the syntactic component of a machine translation system be parameterized, but other components of a machine translation system would also benefit from the parameterization approach. In particular, the lexical-semantic component must be constructed in such a way as to allow principles of the lexicon to be parameterized. Thus, UNITRAN uses two levels of processing, syntactic and lexical-semantie, both of which operate on the basis of language-independent ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~r 1992 6 2 4 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUO. 23-28, 1992 knowledge that is parameterized to encode lauguage~ specific information (see figure 1). Within the syntactic level, the language-independent and language-speeilic information are supplied, respectively, by the principles and parmnetets of government-binding theory (henceforth, GB) (see Chomaky (1981, 1982)). Within the lexical-semantie level, the language-independent and language-specific information are supplied by a set of general LCS mappings and the associated parameters for each language, respectively. Tim interface between the syntactic and semantic levels allows the source-language structure to be mapped system-atically to the conceptual form, and it allows the targetdanguage structure to be realized systematically from lexical items derived from the conceptual form. This work represents a shift away from colnplex, language-specific syutactic translation without entirely abandoning syntax. Furthermore, the work moves toward a model that employs a well-defined lexieal conceptual representation without requiring a \"deep\" semantic conceptualizatiou. Consider the following example: (1) (i) I stabbed Jnhn","(ii) Yo le di pufialadas a Juan","'I gave knife-wounds to John' This example illustrates a type of distiuctiou (henceforth called divergence as presented in Dorr (1990a)) that arises in machine translation: the source-language predicate, stab, is ,napped to more than one target-language word, dar puiialadas a. This divergence type is lezical in that there is a word selection variation between the source language and the target language. Such divergeuees are accounted for by lexical-semantie parameterization, as we will see in section 3. The following section of this paper will provide a catalog of syntactic divergences between the source and target languages. The set of parameters that are used to account for these divergences will be described. In the third section, we will exanfine the divergences that occur at tire lexical-semantie level, and we will see how the parametric approach accounts for these divergences as well. Finally, we will turu to the evaluation and coverage of tile system. 2 Toward a Catalog of Syntactic","Divergences Figure 2 shows a diagram of the UNITItAN syntactic processing component. The parser of this component provides a source-language syntactic structure to the lexical-semantic processor, and, after lexical-semantic processing is completed, the generator of this component provides a target-language syntactic structure. Both the parser and generator of this component have access to the syntactic principles of GB theory. These principles, which act as constraints (i.e., filters) on the syntactic structures pro-Figure 2: Design of the Syntactic Processing Component duced hy the parser and the generator, operate on tim basis of parameter settings that supply certain lauguage-specific iulbrmation; this is where syntactic divergences are factored out from the lexical-semantic representation. The Gll principles and parameters are organized into modules whtme constraints are applied in the following order: (1) X, (2) Boundiug, (3) Case, (4) 'iYace, (5) Ilinding, and (6) 0. A detailed descriw tiou of these modules is provided in Dorr (1987). We will look t, riefiy at a number of these, /hensing on how syntactic divergences are accounted for by this approach.

For example, the constituent order parameter characterizes the word order distinctions among English, Spanish and German. Unlike English and Spanish, German is assumed to be a subject-object-verb language that adheres to tim verb-second requirement in matrix clauses (see Safir (1985)). Thus, for the sentence 1 have seen him, we have the following contrusting argument structures: (2) (i) I have seen him","(ii) Yo he visto a dl","'I have seen (to him)'","(iii) Ich habe ihn gesehen","'I have him seen' The X module builds the phrase-structure from the general scheme of figure 4 and the parameter settings described above. The principles and parameters of the remaining modules are then applied as constraints to the phrase-structure representation. We will now examine each of the remaining modules in turn. 2.2 Principles and Parameters of the","Government Module Government Theory is a central notion to the Case and Trace modules. A familiar example of the government principle in English is that a verb governs its object. 4 We will examine the effect of this module in sections 2.4 and 2.5. 2.3 Principles and Parameters of the","Bounding Module The Bounding module is concerned with the distance between pairs of co-referring elements (e.g., trace-antecedent pairs). The fundamental principle of the bounding module is that the distance between co-referring elements is not allowed to be more than one bounding node apart, where the choice of bounding nodes is allowed to vary across languages. The bounding nodes parameter setting accounts for a syntactic divergence between Spanish and English (and German): (3) (i)* Whol did you wonder whether ti went to","school? ~","(ii) LQui6n, crees tfi queti rue a la esenela? The reason (3)0) is ruled out is that the word who has moved beyond two bounding nodes. It turns out that the corresponding Spanish sentence (3)(ii) is well-formed since the choice of bounding nodes is different and only one bounding node is crossed. 2,4 Principles and Paranaeters of the Case","Module The Case module is in charge of ensuring that all noun phrases are properly assigned abstract case (e.g., nominative, objective, etc.). The Case Filter rules out any sentence that contains a non-case-marked noun phrase. The notion of government is relevant to case assignment since an element assigns case only if it is a governing case-assigner. Tile setting of the type of government parameter for English, Spanish, and German characterizes the following divergences: (4) (i) I saw Guile","• I saw to Guile","(ii)* Lo vi Guille","Lo vi a Guile s","(iii) lch sah Guile","• lch sah zn Guille","4See Dorr (1987) for a more formal definition of the government principle.","sit who is spoken emphatically, this sentence can almost be understood as an echo question corresponding to the statement I wondered whether John went to school.

The ECP is parameterized by means of the null subject parameter. As discussed in section 1, the null subject parameter accounts for the null subject distinction between Spanish, on the one hand, and F,n-glish and German on the other: (5) (i) Vo vi ellibro","Vi el libro","(ii) I saw the book","* Saw the book","(iii) Ich salt das Buch","* Sah das Buch Art additional parameter that is relevant to the Trace module is the proper governors parameter.

This module is concerned with the coreference relations among noun phrases, and it is dependent on the governing category parameter, which specifies that a governing category for a syntactic constituent is (roughly) the nearest dominating clause that has a subject. This parameter happens to have the same setting for English, Spanish, and German, but see Dorr (1987) for a description of other settings of this parameter (e.g., for Icelandic) based on work by Wexler & Manzini (1986), 2.7 Principles and Parameters of the 0","Module The 0 module provides the interface between the syntactic component and the lexical-aemantic component.

Tile 0-roles represent positions in the LCS representations of lexical entries associated with the input words. Thus, the construction of the interlingun is essentially a unification process that is guided by the pointers left behind by 0-role assignment. The mapping, or linking rule between the syntactic positions and the positions of the LCS representation is shown in figure 7. In terms of 0-role assignment, the phrasal head X assigns #-roles corresponding to positions in the LCS associated with X j. For example, the syntactic subject Bk is assigned the logical subject position fl~ in the LCS. Once all these roles have been assigned, the interlingual representation is composed simply by reenrsively filling the arguments of tile predicate into their assigned LCS positions.

The LCS Linking rule and the CS~ function are the two fundmnental principles of the lexical= semantic component. In order to account for lexical-semantic divergenc~, these principles nmst be parameter]zeal. In general, translation divergences occur when there is all exception to one (or both) of these principles in one language, but not in the other. Titus, the lexical entries have bccn constructed to support parametric variation that ac counts for such exceptions. The parameters are used in lexical entries as overrides for tile LCS linking rule and (JS~ function. We will now examine examples of how each parameter is used. 3.1.1 %' Parameter The '*' parameter refers to an LG'S position that is syntactically realizable in the surfitce sentence. This parameter accounts for sSructural divergence: (9) (i) John entered the house","(ii) Juan entr6 en la casa","'John entered (into) the house' Here, the Spanish sentence diverges structurally from the English sentence since the noun phrase (the house) is realized as a prepositional phrase (en la cuss). In order to account for this divergence, the lexicon uses tile * marker ill the LCS representation associated with the lexical entries for enter and entrnr. This marker specifies tim pbrasal level at whictl an argument will be projected: in tile Spanish lexical entry, the marker is associated with all LCS position that is realized at a syntactically higher phrasal level than that of tile English lexical entry. 3.1.2 :INT and :EXT Parameters The :INT and :EXT paraineters allow tile I,CS linking rule to be overridden by associating a logical subject with a syntactic complement aud a logical argument with a syntactic subject. A t)o~iblc effect of using these parameter settings is that there is a subject-object reversal during translation. Such a reversal is called a thematic divergcuee: (10) (i) I like Mary","(ii) Me gnats Maria","'Mary pleases me' tlere, the subject of the source-language sentence, I, is translated into all object position, and the object of the source-language sentence Maria is translated into a subject position. Ill order to accouut for this divergence, the lexicon uses the :INT and :EXT markers in the LCS representation associated with the lexieal entries for gustar. The English lexieal entry does not contain thesc markers since tile LCS linking rule does not need to be overridden in this case. 3.1.3 :CAT Parameter The :(~AT lllarker provides a syntactic category for all LCS argument. Recall that the CS'K function maps all LCS type to a syntactic category (see figure 8). When this mapping is to bc overridden by a lexicaI entry, the language-specific marker :CAT is used, This parameter accounts for categorial divergence: (11) (i) 1 am hungry","(ii) ich hahe Hunger","'l have hsnger ~ llere, not only are tl~e predicates be and hubert lexically distinct, but the arguments of these two predicates are categorially divergent: ill English, the urgmnent is all adjectival phrase, and, ill German, the argument is a noun phrmse. ¢~'bc :CAT marker is used in the Gernmn definition to force the PROP-EWFY al'glnln~nt tO be realized as a norm rather than an adjective. Thus, the (2S~ function is overridden daring realization of tile word Hunger in this exampie. 3.1.4 :DEMOTE and :PROMOTE","~lar~tln(~t [Jr s The :I)EMOTE and :PROMOTE markers, like the :INT and :EXT markers, allow the LCS linking rule to be overridden by iL~sociating a logical head with a syntactic adjunct or complement.

The approach is interlingual: an underlying language-independent form of the source language is derived, and any of the three target languages, Spanish, English, or German, can be produced from this form. Perhaps the most important advance of UNITRAN is the mapping between the lexical-semantie level and the syntactic level. In particular, tile 8ys~ tern has been shown to select and realize the appropriate target-language words, despite the potential for syntactic and lexical divergences. The key to be-ing able to provide a systematic mapping between languages is modularity: because the system has been partitioned into two different processing levels, there is a deeoupling of the syntactic and lexicalo semantic decisions that are made during the translation process.
