Introduction","paragraphs":["Bahasa Indonesia (lndonesianlanguage) is anationallanguage for tile Republic of Indonesia which imites 27 cultural backgrounds. It is widely nsed bymore than 100millious speaker but unfortunately, does not gain much attention for its automatic processing by computers. In 1987, a co operative research in machine trans - lation with Japan sparks thenatural languageprocessingresearch in Indonesia. In support to the on going project of Multilingual Machine Translation Sytem for Asian Language organized by Center for International Cooperaliou in Computerization (CICC)- Japan and other Asian cotmtries (China.Indonesia,Malaysia and Thailand), we developed BIAS: an analysis prograni for Indonesian language which output an interlingual representation. By incorporating interlingual an',dysis technology, we will be able to include BIAS as part of multi-language translation system in a very effective way. Tiff s paper describes the design consideration of BIAS from the view point of linguistic theories and knowledge representation formalism, The design is based on an interlingual approach to machine !ranslation which accepts input sentences in one language and produces sentences in other languages [Figure 1 ]. In particular BIAS is a program that takes natural language text ms input and produces its tmderlying interlingual representation at a certain level of details that serve as a language-independent representation for the machine translation environment. ahasa"]},{"title":"Indonesia j/","paragraphs":["Figare 1.

Analysis Method","paragraphs":["There are many ways of attacking the problem of natural langu age processing. At one end of the spectrum are analyz, ers that read the input sentences, very closely following every twist in syntax, trying to interpret every bit of information contained in the sentence. In most cases, these analyzers separate the syntactic and semantic parts of the analysis into separate consecutive stages, paying much more attention to the syntactic part at the expense of semantic [Gersham,82]. At the other end are the analyzers that skim through the text looking for certain types of ioforuaation andpaying attention only to the words and expression relevant to the task [DeJong,79]. This approach is very effective and intuitively corresponds to what people do wlrde skimming newspaper stories. However, the danger in tttis approach lies in the possibilty of misunderstanding wlmt is being stated. BIAS is a multi-level analyzer, similar to the first type describe above, with the ability to perfom~ reasoning in each level of analysis. The method used in BIAS is theoretically consistent with the Standard Theory and Case Grarumar as well as nonmonotonic reasoning formalism. Theprocess starts with analysis of sound sequences and ends by producing its interlingaal reprc~ntation. In-depth discnssioo on each of the analysis phase in BIAS and the selection of appropriate linguistic theories follows."]},{"title":"2.1 Morphological Analysis Ph&~e","paragraphs":["Preliminary analysis of Indonesian words poses an especially diffic~dt problem : the transformation of word category and its meaning as the t'esuIt of ,'fffixation. Although it seems better to segment input sentences beforehand, it is not natural in the general sense to do this process on the first basis, We h ave to combine the processes of phonological and morphological atvalysis in ord~ to extract the root word from an inflected form. The process will involve the following : an inflected word is an al yzed to give it s root word and affixes, all owing the system to recognize the altered structm'e aud meaning of rite inflected word. This phase uses the lexicon, monphological and phonological knowledge in the form of transform ation rules. Further, we observed the fnllowing word formationrules which indicate their characteristics : (at A word can be constnlcted using prefix, suffix or confix. (b) A word can be constructed using a repetition of root word as in 'kura-kura' (turtle), or repeating the word constructed in (at as in the case of 'berlari-lari' (jogging). Our analysis showed that rite complex types of word formation could lead to some problems while constnlctiog the structure of the lexicon [Yosuf,88]. It is evident that iu the lexicon, a word should be described briefly, st) that the search can be efficient. Hence, the lexicon should contain only it simple form of word which, in tlds case, is the root form. How can we deal with a word with affixation ? In our findings, the wnrd with affixation could be processed by using the following procedure."]},{"title":"Algorithm: MorphO","paragraphs":["Input:"]},{"title":"w","paragraphs":["ord Output : root word, affixation and semantic markers","o Assume that the word is a root word.","If this word is in the dictio,utry, check whether it is in its root","form or purely repetitive form.","- Assume that the word is a word with some prefix.","Check for the following cotulitions : - The root word is repetitive word and twt an idiom with afftxation.

There are several filters being used for extraction of this semantic. In the examples, mem-i cause the word pukul which has action as its original semantic to become repetitive in its meaning when combined. In addition to morphological construction as described above, there are phonological rules which are handled in parallel in the morphological analysis phase, Thephonological rulesdetermine the transformation of phonetic structure of a root word for a given complex word. We include some examples to show its construction as in Table 3. 2.2 Syntactic A nalysis Phase This phase covers those steps that affect the processing of sentences into structural descriptions or syntactical tree by using a grammatical description of linguistic structure. The major components are syntactic knowledge (grammar rules) and lexicon. There are several linguistic phenonema worth describing for Indonesian language. For instance, the language structure membuat(make) mellg~oreng (fried) me~gurang (s~bstract) menunggu (wait) meaxapu (sweep) mencakur (shave) pemukul (hitter) pelighasat (agitator) bet'usaha (effort) be~uang(room) be~ang (have money) beternak (lifestock) of Bahasa Indonesia has a different structure compared to English and other languages. One of the most significant difference is that the Indonesian language apply various rules to cozlstruct Adverb Phrase. Adjective Phrase and Relative Clauses. For example, in constructing Adverb Phrase. it is allowed to combine adverb and adjective in addition to adverb and verb. It is also possible to form Adjective Phrase using adjective followed by noun rather than the default order of notre and adjective. This notion reslflted from tile categorial ambiguity of some words. Examine the following phrases : rumah (N) merah (Adj) panjang (Adj) tangan (N) (house) (red) (long) (hand) cepat(Adv) merah (Adj) berjalan (V) cepat (Adv) (quickly) (red) (walk) (quickly) BIAS use a bottom-up technique IMatsumoto.83] in the syntactic analysis phase.

The goal of this phase is to construct a clear representation of tile exact meaning of a given selulence; hence, it is a lan~ua~e-indeoendent rel)resentation suitable fur a generation process uf target languages. In order to achieve this, we need commonsense knowledge, in addition to semantic knowledge. In Ballasa Indonesia tile verbal elements of tile sentence are tile major source of the structure: tile main verb in the proposition is the focus around which the other phrase, or cas~,revolve and file auxiliary verb contain much of the information about modality. Hence, the Case grlu'nmar is tile appropriate selectioa tor the semantic analysis part. Case frame are the mech~mism for identifying the specific cases allowed for any particular verb. The case frante fur each verb indicates the relationships which are required in any sentence in which the verb ,appears and those relationship which are optional. Let us look at some popular example sentences :"]},{"title":"Palu itu memukul paku itu.","paragraphs":["(the hammer) (hit) (the nail)"]},{"title":"Pakuitu dipukul oleh paluitu.","paragraphs":["(the nail) (was hit) (by) (the hanuner)"]},{"title":"Sese.rang memukul pakuitu dengan paluit..","paragraphs":["(someone) (hit) (tile nail) (with) (the hatmner) The verb, memukul(hit), ,allows three primary cases: agentive, instnmlental ,and objective.

The syntactic part adapts file Extended Standard theory and hence, it is favorable to use first order logic to represent its knowledge. The u~ of Case Grammar in semantic analysis phase leads us to choose the network-based formalism as the representation. Sinunons and Hendrix [Simmons,73 ] have provided a clear language for semantic network based on the Case Grammar. However, we also incorporate 'slot fillers' from the frames system [Minsky,81] as a solution to handle incomplete sentences. As the consequences of the selection of the representation method for the linguistic knowledge of Bahasa Indonesia, BIAS have multiple inference methods incorporate in each level of analysis. In syntactic and semantic analysis phase, defanlt reasoning is performed to solve the problem of incomplete knowledge. In this case, first order logic must be augmented with defanlt operators in order to penuit non-monotouicity. [Reiter,78] Because of space limitation, we leave out in.depth discussion on inference techniques (see[Yusuf,91] [Schubert ,79]), and present our summary of work in Table 5. 4. Conclusion The use of linguistic theories and appropriate knowledge representation techniques provide BIAS anew insight in attacking the problem of language analysis for interlingua machine translation system, especially for Bahasa Indonesia. Many representation formalism and reasoning system have been brought into consideration not only for a 'pure' sentence analysis but in order to design an effective and efficient intelligent system capable of capturing and reasoning with linguistic knowledge.
