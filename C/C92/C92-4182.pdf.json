First, information about tile utterance type and the discourse entities of the next utterance is graspcd using a dialogue interpretation model. Second, a domain-dependent knowledge base for noun-phrase usage is developed, focusing on the dialogue situations in context. Finally, we propose a strategy to make a set of the appropriate expressions in the next utterance, using the information and the knowledge base. This set of expressions is used to select the correct candidate from tim speech recognition output. This paper exantines some of the processes creating sets of polite expressions, deicti6 expressions, and compound ilOUll pllra-~es, which ~tre COlnlUOll ill telephone inquiry dialogue. 1 Introduction A high-quality spoken-language processing system must use knowledge of dialogue and spoken-language. Using dialogue knowledge facilitates understanding and predicting utterances in context. Using spoken-language knowledge, that is knowledge about how tile speaker expresses what he/she wants to say, makes it possible for the system to recognize and generate the more complex expressions that are nornmlly ased ill our daily dialogues. To make language processing in the whole spokenlangnage processing system more efficient, it. is vital how to select the correct speech recognition output in the speech-language interface. The use of discourse-level knowledge is an effective way to do this[6][11]. For example, MINDS[6] applied dialogue-level knowledge, particularly for propositional contents, to predict the expected utterance form for the speech recognition, ilowever, although MINDS showed good resuits, several llroblems remain before it can lie made into a complete spoken-language processing system: 1. how to construct the dialogue structure for the given domain,","2. how to treat predictive concepts regarding not only the propositional contents but also the speaker's intention,","3. and, how to etmose a set of surface forms tbat the speaker might utter about the predicted concept. Also, MINDS was concerned with a system to participate in human-machine dialogue. On the other band, we want to monitor a human-human dialogue. We proposed a dialogue understanding model[7], and a context-sensitive method to predict abstract information allout both tile intentional and propositional contents of tile next utterance[11]. These are our an-swers to the above problems 1 and 2.","From tile point of view of human behavior, a potential approacb to selecting the appropriate surface erpression forms (SEFs) is using spoken-lauguage knowledge. In general, when we are talking about a concept X, there are many possible surface expressious and forms to represent X. From a psychological (or psyeholinguistic) point of view, Clark[3] pointed out five abstract factors which should be considered ill ,asking what linguistic devices should speakers use ?. These are: knowledge of the listener, the coopevalive principle, the reality principle, the social context, and the linguistic devices available. In the eomputatioual linguistics area, Appelt[1] has developed a framework to generate a sentence in a context-sensitive way, based on speech act tbeories. Unfortunately, however, there also remains, as he described ms a future study, the problem of choosing a lexically appropriate SEF from among candidates in a social conlexl. This paper describes a context-sensitive framework for selectiug all SEF for noun-phrases(NPs). This method is sensitive to botb tbe utterance situation and the history of the dialogue. To do this, first, we analyze the relations between concepts and SEFs, and between applicable situations and contexts, using a corpus of Japanese inquiry dialogues. Then, we make a domain-dependent knowledge source for NP usage, and define rules driven by applicable conditions to determine a set of possible SEFs in the knowledge base. Finally, we give exanaples of the SEI\" selection, especially for polite expressions, deictifi expressions, and compound NPs, which are common in our target domain, and describe a simple experiment to evaluate using the ATR dialogue database. The result show tllat tile method can choose tbe contextually correct expression from the speech recognition output candidates, and can be used in tile generation module of a spoken-language processing system to generate and determine all appropriate expression under tile dialogue situation. Throughout this paper, all examples are in Japanese and written in italic. English translations follow in parentheses. NP denotes a noun phrase, and SEF denotes a surface expression form. SEFs are enclosed ill double quotation marks and concepts are enclosed in single quotation marks. 2 Dialogue Interpretation and Predicting","the Next Utterance The next. utterance call be predicted after understanding the previous utterances, because predicted information must be affected by tile dialogue struc-AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aour 1992 1 1 5 2 PROC.

Assuming that tile system has recognized such conditions, we can efficiently choose the correct speech recognition candidate by searching the SEFs that are appropriate under the conditions. 4.1 Rules of Applicable Conditions [terc, two terms are defined for explanation:","seed: if the predicted contextual information is bolmd to a particular SEF, then the seed of tile contextual information is tile SEI\", otherwise the seed is the value of the lexieal node linked by tbe l)rag llnk to the concept node corresponding to the contextual information,","preferable set: a set of SEFs derived from a seed by an applicable rnlc, whicb then takes first priority for selecting the candidate. The basic rule for making a preferable set is: collect tile SEFs by following the eq link from the sced. Because in this paper we are focusing on dialogue situations and contcxts ratber than the speaker's be-liefs, we only cover rules regarding changes by different viewpoints. For a predicted contextual information I, considering the dialogue situations ill Class 2(a):","I. if I is in the territory of information of the other agent, then make a preferable set by following the eq-if-polite link from the seed, additionally, considering the preceding context:","2. if [ has an antecedent which denotes the status of the other agent, i.e., there is an instantiated variallle node corresponding to I , then replace the seed with the antecedent, i.e., the SEF of I.he variable node, and make a preferable sct by following the eq-if-pollte llnk from the seed. Considering the contexts ill Class 2(b):","3. if 1 is a compound noun, (it's obviously the antecedent) then shift the seed to the concept one-level up t and make a prefcrablc set using the basic rule,","4. if l includes two or more concepts or SEFs and there is a concept node which is the upper node of both of these concepts, then shift the seed to the upper concept and make a preferable set using the basic rule 2, I Precisely, shifting a seed to a concept metals an operation to replace the seed with the SI~F of the lexical node followed by the prag llnk from the concept node. In this case an auxilisa'y word is usually added. AcrEs DE COLING-92. NA,'CrE.s, 23-28 AOt~r 1992 1 I 5 4 PRec. ot: COLING-92, NANTES.

Abstract information about the constituents of the next utterance can be predicted based on the dialogue interpreting model. Then, domain-dependent knowledge for NP usage was developed based on an extended NP identifica-tion model. Tile knowledge base is characterized by its ability to derive the set of possible surface expression forms from the predicted contextual infornration. We define rules for applicable conditions, particularly ill polite Japanese, bmsed on an analysis of NP changes. Finally, using the above two mechanisms a strategy was proposed for selecting tile appropriate surface expression form representing the predicted concept in a context-sensitive way. In the fllture, we plan to integrate this method with a method of predicting expressions of tile speaker's intention, tp form a complete system. It is also vital to make tile method more powerful, so it can automatically construct the domain-dependent knowledge base from thesauri and/or corpora of tile domain, and call model and recognize various dialogue situations.
