The first is a lexicalised version of depen dency grammar, and this can be nsed to provide tree-structured analyses of sentences (though some-what tlatter than those usually provided by phra.se structure grammars). The second is a new forrnal ism, 'Dynamic Dependency Gramniar', which uses axioms and deduction rules to provide analyses of sentences in terms of transitioos between states. A reformulation of dependency grammar usiug state transitions is of interest on several grounds. Firstly, it can be used to show that incremental interpretation is possible without requiring notions of overlapping, or flexible constituency (as ill some versions of categorial grammar), and without destroy ing a trasmparent link between syntax and semantics. Secondly, the reformulation provides a level of description which can act as an intermediate stage between the original grammar and a parsing algorithm. Thirdly, it is possible to extend the relbrnm lated grammars with further axioii~s and deduction rules to provide coverage of syntactic constructions such as coortlination which are tlitficult to encode lexically. 1 Dynamics Dynantics can roughly be described ms the study (ff systems which consist of a set of states (cognitive, physical etc.) and a family of binary lmnsil~on relalionships between states, corresponding to actions which can be performed to change from one state to another (van Benthem, 1990).

(ln fact, since dependency grammar allows centre embedding of arbitrary depth, the corresponding dynamic grammar provides an unlimited number of states).

A'I'Ns use a finite number of states combined with a recursion mechanism, and act ea'~entially in the same way ms a top down parser. They are not particularly suited to increment,'d interpretation. To get an idea of how logics (instead of the more usual algebra.s) can be used to specify dynamic systenLs in general, it is worth considering a reformulation of the {bllowing finite state machine (FSM):","h 0 l 2 :1 This accepts .'~ grammatical any string which maps from the initial state, 0, to the final state, 3 (i.c. strings of the form: nb*eb). The FSM cart be reformulated using a logic where the notation,","StateO Str Statel is used to state that the string, Str, perfornm a transition from StateO to Statel.

Thus the following are mssumed, t 0 \"a\" t 1 \"b\" I 2 \"b\" 3 1 \"c\" 2 The transitions given by the single letter strings are put together using a deduction rule, Sequencing, 2 which states that, provided there is a proof that String, takes us from some state, So, to a state S t and a proof that Stringb takes us from St to $2, then there is a proof that the concatenation of the strings takes us from S0 to $2. The rule puts to aether strings of letters if the final state reached by tile first string matches an initial state for tile secontl string. For example, the rule may be instantiated as: A string is grammatical according to the logic if and only if it is possible to construct a proof of the statement 0 Str 3 using the axioms and the Sequencing Rule.

Adjacency is a reasonably standard restriction, and has been proposed as a universal principle e.g. by Hudson (1988). Given adjacency, it is possible to extract bracketed strings (mid hence a notion of constituent structure) by grouping together each head with its dependents (and the dependents of its dependents).

The 1. 5 Incremental Interpretation It is possible to augment each state with a semantic type and a semantic value. Adopting a 'standard' A-calculus semantics (c.f. Dowty et al, 1981) we obtain the following transitions for the string \"Sue saw\": 12For this purpose, it is convenient to treat an analysis in a DDG as the traasition~ performed by each word.

The base types s and ap map to the semantic types l and e, stmtding for trutb-value and enl, ity respectively. Categories with argmnents map to corresponding flmctional types. Provided a close mapping between syntactic and semantic types is assumed, the addition of semantic values to the axiom schemata is relatively trivial, as is the addition of semantic vahtes to the lexicon. For example, the semantic value given to the verb saw is AYAX.saw'(X,Y), which has type e~(e-~t). It is worth contrasting the approach taken here with two otller al)proaches to incremental interpretation. Tim first is that of Pnlman (19851. Pulman's approach separates syntactic and senmntie analysis, driving semantic combinations off the actions of a parser for a phrase structnre grammar. The approach was important ill showing that hierarchical syntactic analysis and word by word incremental interpretation are not incompatihle. The second approach is that of Ades and Steedman (19821 who incorporate conlposition rules directly into a categorim granlmar. This allows a certain amount of incremental interpretation dim to tile possibility of forming constitnents for some initial substrings, flowew:r, the incorporation of composition into the grammar itself does haw: sonic unwanted side effects when nfixed with a use of functions of fimctions. For exampie, if the two types, N/N and N/N are composed to give tile type N/N, then this can be modified by an adjectival modifier of type (N/N)/(N/N). Thus, the phrase the very old green car\" can get the bracketing, [the [very [old green]] car]. Although tile Application schema used in DDGs does compose functions together, DI)Gs have identical strong generative capacity to the LDGs they are based upon (the coverage of the grammars is identical, and tile analyses are ill a one-to-one correspondence). 13 6 Applications So far, l)ynamic l)ependeney Grammars can be seen solely as a way to provide incremental parsing and ill-terpretation for Lexicalised l)ependency Grammars. As such, they are not of particular linguistic significance, ltowever, it is possible to use DDGs as subsets of ntore expressive dynamic gramnrars, where extra axioms and deduction rules are used to provide coverage of syntactic phenomena which are difficult to la'I'his is also true for dyn~anic refomlulations of extended versions of LDG which allow functionn of functions. encode lexically (e.g. coordination, topicalisation and extrapcsition). For example, tile following deduction rule (again restricted to non-empty strings), Co String, C,, C~C, Co String,, \"and'~C~ provides all account of the syntax of non-constituent coordination (Milward, 1991). The sentences John gave Mary a book and Peter a paper\" and Sue sold and Peter thinks Bert bought a painting are accepted since \"Mary a book\" and \"Peter a paper\" perform tile same transitions between syntactic states, ms do \"Sue sold\" and \"Peter thinks Ben botlght\" The gr,'mtmars described in this paper have been implemeuted in Prolog. A dynamic gramnlar based upon the extended version of l,I)Gs is being devel oped to provide incremental interpretation for the natural hmguage interface to a grapllics package.
