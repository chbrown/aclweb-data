Nevertheless, they do not provide easily readable structures and they hide the true proximity between Categorial Grammars and Dependency Grammars. We give here an other kind of Proof-Nets which is much related to Dependency Structures similar to those we meet in, for instance (Hudson 1984). These new Proof-Nets are called Connection Nets. We show that Connection Nets provide not only easily interpretable structures, but also that processing with them is more efficient. 1 1,Introduction Nowadays, two formalisms are very attractive in Natural Language Processing:","- Categorial Grammars, and","- Dependency Grammars. Numerous studies try to shed light on their similarities and differences. We may quote for instance works by Hudson (1984, 1990), Barry & Picketing(1990), Hausser (1990), Hepple (1991). One interesting particularity common to these two formalisms seems to be the capacity of leading to an incremental processing, which, in turn, leads to an on-line processing. Moreover, these formalisms are now very well known. Categorial Grammars have been much studied recently, particularly since the article of Ades and Steedman (1982) and the re-discovering of previous works done by Lambek (1958, 1961). The most comprehensive form taken by Categorial Grammars is the Lambek Calculus, studied by many authors like Moortgat (1988, 1990), Buszkowski (1986, 1988), Descl6s (1990)etc. Since the recent work by J-Y Girard (see for instance Girard 1987), which led to the framework of Linear Logic, it has become apparent that the Lambek Calculus amounts to a non-commutative version of a sub-system of Linear Logic, where a structural rule forbids seqnents with an empty antecedent. Semantic properties of this system have been studied by Buszkowski (1986, 1988) and Wansing (1990). Two models are often given: one consists of residuation semigroups spread over free semigroups, and another one is given by the directional typed lambda-calculus. Dependency Grammars are originating from earlier works by the French linguist Tesnitre (1965). They were theoretically studied by Gaifman, who demonstrated theorems on the Generative Capacity of Dependency Grammars. We will consider here that the formalism of \"Word Grammar\" (Hudson 1984, 1990) is representative of this trend. Our purpose in this communication is to show that building dependency structures gives an other kind of semantics for the Lambek Calculus and various subsystems. This semantics is useful in that it will allow us to conceive extensions of the Lambek Calculus. Moreover, the correspondance proposed between these two aspects provides us with a method of parsing related to the conception of \"parsing as deduction\", together with a method for avoiding spurious ambiguities. We will show that it is isomorphic to the method of proof-nets (Girard 1987, Danos and Regnier 1989, Roorda 1990, 1991), but that it has the advantage over this last method of being more effieient and of providing more clarity on the result of processing. The devices we obtain are more readable, because they are interpretable in terms of dependency structures. Otherwi~, the parsing method can be an incremental one. 2. The Method of Proof-Nets in the Lambek Calculus The problem of spurious ambiguities in Categorial Grammar is very often discussed (see for instance Hendriks and Roorda (1991)). A proof-net is a device which contains all the equivalent proofs of the same result. As Roorda (1990) says: \"A proof-net can be viewed as a parallellized sequent proof [...] It is a concrete structure, not merely an abstract equivalence class of derivations, and surely not a special derivation with certain constraints on the order in which the rules must be applied.\" The principles of construction of proof-nets are related to the inference rules of the Lambek Calculus, when it is viewed as a sequent calculus. If we here omit the product, we have the following rules, which belong to two different types: 1 1 am indebted to Dirk Roorda for fruitful discussions during a brief visit I made in Amsterdam in Spring 1991 Ac'rv_s DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 2.3-28 hofrr 1992 3 9 4 Pgoc.

Edges represent dependency links such that the source of an edge is considered as the head and the target as a dependant. Hudson (1984) givcs criteria to distinguish heads and dependants.

OF COL1NG-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 that according to the Keenan's thesis: \"functors agree with their argument\" seem in favour of identification. But other scholars disagree, like Moortgat and Morrill, who introduce in their recent works, four notions: head, dependant,functor and argument. Nevertheless, we will accept the first thesis in the following, adopting the conception of Barry and Pickering (1990) on this subjecL Another problem appears in the necessity of accounting for slructums with multiplicity of heads (in Ihe case of the control of infinitives for instance) because this necessity leads to graphs which are no longer trees, but dags. We assume that a dependency structure is a graph on words, In a first step, we will consider only trees. The approach will be that of a semantic interpretation in terms of wee.s, similar to what we do when we give a semantic interpretation of logic formulae in terms of sets. The usual operators like / and \\ will be interpreted as connection operations in an algebra of trees. In a second step, we will have to modify this interpretation in order to obtain not only application and composition but division too. 4.Operations on Trees We start with a set of directed trees associated to lexical entries. (see figure (3) below). figure (3) c o nnai t : A np np promet np sp[A]","np","trees are called initial trees. The initial state of a representation of the structure of a sentence consists in an ordered sequence of these initial trees, Then, at each ~aep. we build a new tree obtained by connection of previous trees, These operations are: (cf Lecomte 1990)","- left-linkage","- right-linkage A tree GI is right (resp. left) linkable to a tree G2 iff: I) G 1 and G2 are adjacent, G2 being adjacent to the right (w.ap, left) ofG 1 2) GI has a rightmost (resp leftmost) branch the first edge of which is right (resp left) directed and the maximal sub-tree attached to this first edge entirely covers a continuous subtree of G2. The by-product of the right-linkage (resp left-linkage) of GI with G2, when GI is right (resp left) linkable to G2 is the tree G3 obtained as the union of G 1 and G2, modified in the following way: The rightmost dght-direeted (resp. leftmost left-directed) first-levd edge of G 1 is connected to the root of G2, and the subtree of G2 covered by the maximal subtree attached to this edge is said to be marked in G2. Left (res'p. right)-directed edges of G 2 which are not marked romainfree and take precedence in the left-to-right (resp right-to-left) order of first-level edges over those remaining free in G 1. We can introduce restrictions on these operations: we will call restriction-AB the following constraint: the subtree of G 2 covered by the subtre, e of G1 must be identical to the whole tree G2, restriction-C: at most the rightmost (rcsp leftmost) branch of G2 may be uncovered. restriction-Crec: a right (resp left) subtree of G2 may be uncove~d restriction-Cmix: at most the rightmost (resp leftmos0 or the leftmost (resp rightmost) branch of G2 may be uncovered Definition: we call connection tree every initial tree and every tree obtained by the application of linkage operations on earlier connection trees (according to eventual restrictions). We claim that such a system gives an interpretation of very simple categorial grammars, depending on the restrictions we select. Like similar constructions (Stoedman 1991) where general principles such as Adjacency, Directional Consistency and Directional Inheritance arc explained in terms of a more detailed analysis of categories, this system is suited to express such generalities. Because of the structure of linkage operations, these principles are obvious. Adjacency and Directional Consistency are contained in the definition. Directional Inheritance comes from the fact that we never allow to change anything in the labels of edges (the fact that they are left or right directed). We only allow m change tile status of an edge (free to bound or marked). In so doing, we reach, like Steedman does. the conclusion that so-called Dysharmonic Composition Rules are consistent with these principles (even if they are not with the Lambek Calculus[). A connection system eliminates spurious ambiguities because when they are bound, links are undefeasable : there is no way of re-doing something that was primilarly done with success. In this respect, the calculus on trees concurs with the well known method of chart-parsing. (see figure (4): there is only one tree for two reductions by means of Cancellation Schemes).

So, it cannot provide any analysis for sentences with extraction, as for instance: le livre dont je connais le titre est sur la table (the book the title of which I know is on the table) because in such an analysis, we have to transform a regular n (titre) into a functorial category which requires a nonn-tandifier on its right (n/(nkn)). We shall define a new connection system which is a conservative extension of the previous one (except for the admissibility of Dysharmonic Rules). We will call it: the Connection Net System. As for the proof-nets, we want to demonstrate theorems that have a sequent form like: F---~ X, where F is a non empty sequence of categories and X is a category. We distinguish two kinds of connection Irees: those which are on the right-hand side of the sequent we want to demonstrate, and those which are on the left-hand side. When we are viewing the problems in a natural-deduction way, we can say that the first are the trees to build and the second are those which are used in this task. We will call the firstright-trees and the second left-trees. The set of left-trees and right-trees at any stage will be called a Construction Net. Schematically, operations are not merely connections because connections can only expand elementary trees towards more complex ones. And we need operations to reduce the complexity of a tree. For instance, to show the usual rule of Type-Raising: a ~ b/(a~b) we have to show that the fight-tree associated to b/(a~b) reduces to something isomorphic to a. The fact that, generally, the converse (b/(a~)-oa) is not true results from the fact that the same reduction is not possible when the same tree is put on the left-hand side. This exemplifies the fundamental dissymetry of the calculus. 5.2.Type-I Edges and Type-2 Edges","We will then distinguish two sorts of edges and two","sorts of nodes in a connection tree: typed edges and","nodes and type-2 edges and nodes.","Definition: A type-2 edge in a connection tree is: - an odd level edge in a left-tree, or - an even level edge in a right-tree A type-1 edge in a connection tree is: - an even level edge in a left-tree, or - an odd level edge in a right-tree A type-i (i =1.2) node is the target of a type-i edge. Roots are type-1 nodes if in a left-tree, and tyl~- 2 nodes if in a right-tree.","Two nodes are mid to be complementary if they have not","the same type.","Examples: figure (5) a) a new tree assigned to a lexical entry: promet np ,,\" s [infl sp[/l]","np b) a pair (L, R) associated to a sequent: a ~ b/ (a\\b) b"]},{"title":"% ,","paragraphs":["L R Definition: we call identification link either a non-directed edge which links two identical nodes which are complementary, one in a left-tree, the other in a right-tree, or a type-I directed edge linking two complementary nodes having same label.

From now on, L and R will denote respectively: the left hand side and the right hand side of a Construction Net. The Construction Net will be denoted by: <L I R>. 5.4.Linking the Nodes Nodes will be linked according to the following principles: COMPLEMENTARITY: two nodes are linked only if they have the same label and they are of complementary types. NON-OVERLAP: the linking of all the nodes in the Construction Net must meet the non-overlap convention, which stipulates that given two arbitrary intervals, either one contains the other or they are disjoint. Theorem: (Conservativity of Connection Operations) The Non-Overlap condition is a conservative extension of the conditions on connection (restriction C rec) stipulated in ~4. That means: every connection system based on C rec, when translated in the Connection Net System, follows this convention. 5.5.Building a Correct Net Definition: Given an ordered sequence of left-trees L and a right-tree R, we will say that L and R yield a correct net iff there is a linkage of all the nodes in the Construction Net <L I R>, which gives a connected graph, respects the complementarity principle and the non-overlap principle, and is such that: when all the rype-I edges are removed, the graph remains connected.","The fundamental result is the following:","Theorem: (Soundness and Completeness w.r.t.

Secondly, compared to the method of Proof-Nets, it gives more clarity to the resulting structures. It is more efficient too, because the stage of checking the coanexity when suppressing a branch of a type-1 link is replaced by a stage where the connexity is checked only once: when we have removed all the type-1 edges.

In the method defined by Roorda, only type-1 links lead to switches. The reason lies in the necessity of checking that a type-1 link is not used to connect two subsets of the net, which would not be connected without it. (Let us recall that a type-I link refers to a unary rule). In our method, switches are completely avoided. Thirdly. it can be done incrementally. The reason is that the numbering of nodes is consistent with the order of initial trees. Thus, at each stage of the processing from left to right, we may have a beginning net which represents the present state of the processing. Here, the properties of left-associative grammars (Hausser 1990) are reeL Finally, a very few transformations are needed in order to obtain graphs on words which can be really interpreted as Dependency Structures.
