Introduction","This paper presents a conceptual taxonomy of Japanese adjectives, succeeding that on Japanese verbs'. In this taxon~ny, natural language is associated with real world things - - matter, events, attributes - and mental activities - spiritual and sensual. Adjective concepts are divided into two large classes, simple and non-simple. Simple concepts cannot be reduced into further elementary adjective concepts, whereas non-simple ones can be. Roughly speaking, simple concepts are concrete and can be directly associated with physical and mental attributes, whereas non-simple ones are abstract and in-directly associated with them. 2. Simple Adjective Concepts","Verb concepts were well understood as \"change\" fro~ state S O to state S 1 as shown in Fig. 14 Adjective concepts are considered to be captured as the \"difference\" between objects O O and 0 I. Ylg.2 shows how the difference in vertical length between 00 and 01 brings about the concept of \"high\". Notice that surface structures often lack the expression of 00 like \"yama-ga takai (the mountain is high)\". Since the meaning of \"high\" cannot be expressed only by O 1, deep structures need O 0 as an object for comparison. - 209 - change State So State S, otoko-ga ie-kara deru.

(1) where each symbol in parentheses stands for a constituent. For example, c and s stand for an object for ccmparllon and a sub- ~ect, respectively. Scae constituents are obligatory in the sense that they are indispensable in the recognition of difference. Seven types of structural patterns are proposed, according to the combination of obligatory constituents. 2.2 Semantic Contents","The semantic contents of Ad in formula (1) are categoriz~ ed into physical, mental and abstract attribute. We classify each of them in detail because we cannot detect aDy difference - 210 - v without such information. In the case of verbs, twenty categories such as displacement, defo~nstion, and spiritual activity were proposed to classify the semantic contents of \"changes\". We modify them elightly to apply to the classification of semantic contente of adjectives. For example, dieplacement and deformation are modified to location and shape, respectively. 3. Non-Simple Adjective Concepte","Non-simple adjective concepts are not directly associated with p~eisal or mental attributee~ therefore we emphasize an analysis of how they ere composed of simple ones. 3.1 Complex Concepts-A","For example, there is a complex adjective \"hoso-nagai (thin-long)\" which is registered as one word in ordinary Japanese dictionaries. The conne0ti ~ relation between two adjective concepts is a logical product in this case. The complex concept of A is defined ss follows: if two adjective concepts are connected by a rule and the connected concept is represented by a complex word of those adjectives, it is call-ed a \"complex concept of A\". Two types of connecting rules are proposed: logical product and syntactic relation."]},{"title":"3.2 Complex Concepts-B","paragraphs":["This concept is usually represented by a simple word and is considered to consist of several elementary adjective concepts. No general rule can be found to connect elementary ad-Jective concepts. Semantic contents of the concepts are classified into such categories as linguistic activ£ty and character. 3.3 Derivative Concepts","Some concepts possess e function of deriving s new concept by operati~ others. They have two morphemic strUctttres, prefix ~ and ett~fix, which add certain i~ormetion to operands. For example, st~ffix \"-tarash~\" adds the meaning \"indeed\" to its operand. Such derivative information is categorized into"]},{"title":"five classes. - 211 -","paragraphs":["4. Classification","There are approximately 530 adjectives considered sufficient for daily Japanese. We actually classified their concepts, n~nbering about 630, according to types and categories proposed in Sec.2 and 3. They were well classified into those types and categories. In the classification of simple concepts, \"standardconcepte\" were chosen from among similar concepts, amounting to approximately 270. They might be considered \"primitives\" in the sense that every other adjective concept can be derived from them by some rule. 5. Extraction of Conceptual Features","We extract conceptual features from each A d and its constituents, noticing the standard concepts with physical attributes obtained in Sec.4.The following analysis shows par@ of the feature extraction from taka..._~i (high)/ hikui (low)."]},{"title":"taka__~Chigh) / ~i_k_~Clow)","paragraphs":["Polysm, y (1) Structural pattern~ Ad(S,C), semantic","contents; shape","s, c : thing","A d : The vertical length of s is larger/smaller","than that of c.

Sentence Production from Picture Patterns","System SUPP, which accepts moving picture patterns, in-terprets the meaning of changes in them, infers about similarity among changes, end describes the results in Japanese and English sentences, was constructed as an application of - 212 - the conceptual taxonomy of verbs. SUPPwas improved to interpret physical attributes of piotnre patterns. Fourteen standard concepts were chosen for this improvement. An example of experimental results ~a shown in F~4r.).
