Bennett Li~istios Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin","Although there has been work on machine translation since the early 1950\"s, it is only in the last few years that ~ systems have become capable of p~'oductng output and-where near the quality needed for wide-spread use. The LinguAetics Research Center (LRC) at the University of Texan at Austin has developed a working machine translation system. METAL, the actual translation system, produces quality E~l£sh translations for German technical manuals. Experiments conducted with up to 200 contiguous pa~es of text have been most encourt! the LRC plans to .have a production system by early 1983.","METAL is a modular system in which the lexicons, grammar, and analyzer are distinct packages, each of which may be modified without affecting the other two. This paper will present an overview of METAL's ltnguAsttc component, giving a geners~ overview of the scope and format of the METAL lexicons and a somewhat more detailed description of the METAL grammar. I% will then present a description of the translation process using a simple German sentence, and conclude with a discussion of the current state of the linguistic component, along with comaents on what improvements are necessary in the ftucther development of the systemo - 29 - METAL Lexicons","This section will briefly describe the scope and format of the system lexicons. METAL employs monolingual lexicons for both the source and ts~get languaKes, and bilingual lexicons to equate each source language word' with a corresponding target language equivalent. The bilin~pA~ or \"transfer\" lexicons permit a word in the source language to be translated into an~ of variety of words in the target language depending on nuances of gre~matical context. The lexicons e.re feature-based, consisting of a series of syntactic and semantic features and values for each lexioal entry. The paper will discuss this feature-based system in general, looking at the format of both the monolingual 8J~d bil~ugual (\"transfer\"). lexicons. This section will conclude with co-..ents on the codlnK procedures developed, but not yet fully implemented, for use in METAL lexicons. METAL Grammar","This section will describe the format for the gran~ar rules used in the analysis of source language texts and the synthesis of corresponding target language strings. METAL 8~am~ur rules are augmented context-free phrase structure rt~es with a wide range of options allowed in the au~nentation partso","The METAL approach to gre~r is rather different from the \"standard\" approach found in many recent articles. In the recent work by linguists such as Chomeky. Bresnsn, and Gazd8~. the mean thrust has been to establish a theoretical framework which may then be applied to human lan~s~e! METAL°s'app~coach has been the opposite, i.e., to seek solutions to re~ language problems and to use these solutions in the development of a theoretical framework. - 30-","The grammatical framework allows the linguist to devise tools when they seem appropriate, and to discard them if they turn out to be unnecessary. In this section particular emphas-is will be given to the various au~nentation parts of the grammar rules, particularly how these parts are used to constrain rules, to build syntactic trees, and to generate the appropriate word order for the target language. This section will conclude with a discussion of METAL transformations and of the case frames mechanism, which is used to disambiguate strings. Sample Translation","To illustrate the operation Of the linguistic component within METAL, the paper will then examine some significant steps involved in the analysis and synthesis of a German sentence. This examination will point up some of the typical problems in German - English machine translation, and the solutions used in METAL. Using representative lexical entries and grammar rules tO demonstrate theprocess, the paper will illustrate the production of the correct English translation for the sample sentence. Conclusion","~TAL is capable of producing quality machine translation of a large number of German sentence into English, but the system needs more development before a production version is available, In this section the paper will describe the limitations on and problems with the. METAL linguistic component in its present form, and will outline the improvements currently planned to overcome these limitations and problems. Particularly important in this regard is the need to develop the semantics of METAL from its present state into a full scale MT semanticso - 31 -"]}]}
