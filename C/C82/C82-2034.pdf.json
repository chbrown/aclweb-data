By inflexlonal knowledge we mean information about rules of inflection/deflection for regul~ words together with a llst of exceptions, Such knowledge can be successfully manipulated by a rule-based system. The research is a part of big undertakin~, aimed at construction of a system able to converse in Polish with casual user.","The problem we are concerned with may be stated as follows. For each word in input sentence the system should find its basic form and dictionary i~ ormatlon connected with It.","The simplest approach to this problem is to store all forms of words in the forms dictionary, which associates them with their bsslc forms. This method is acceptable for small sets of words. It places too big strain on system resources for bigger dictionaries. T~e way to minimize resource usage is to exploit regularities in the inflection.","Each isn6uage possesses some regnllarltes in its IDflexion. The extent of these regularities is different in different languages. Also the number of different inflectional forms may be different, e.g. an average polish verb can have about 100 forms. This forced us to think seriously about using regularltles even in lexlcal components for small subsets of","~' - 146 -","of lan~ageo We view the inflectionsl analysis system as","composed out of %~o parts~ -","an","exception dictionary wi~h all forms taken as it-","- a mechanism e~9~oiti ~ ~e@~lax~ties for getting neoessax-y efficiency in ses~ch and ~ving resources.","We based our mechanism on the analysis of endings. The ending is defined as a ps~t of word which is changed while reducing the word to its b~sic (d~Ictionax~) form. Polish language is characterized by many rules of deflection, which may be applicable to a given ending° A single word may be interpreted in as many w~s as many endings we can distinguish in it, multiplied by a number of applicable rules for each ending. Therefore such candidate ending must be confirmed by checking result in the diction~ of basic forms after applying proposed deflection rule.","The described knowledge was written down in rule-based system \"FORS\". \"PORS\" is rather classical forwax~-driven rule system with some degree of extensibility. I% is written in programming language LISP and is composed out of three parts:","- facts, represented as list structures stored in a fully indexed data base8","- rules of the form","condition =~ aotlon action ...","- control mechanism for choosing and applying rules.","Eaoh condition is a sequence of patterns of faots, which must be asserted in a database for rule to be applicable.","Patterns may contain typed variables. The type Of a variable is identified by one-letter long prefix. Prefix must be a non~alphanumex~Ical character. Variable type may be defined by providing matching functions for this type. 147 -","Inflexional knowledge is represented in \"YORS\" as follows.

Also, for a given word a couple of allowed endings may be lndentified (e•g• one letter long, two letters long etc.).

In a current version, the set of rules for regular endings is divided into ~oups according to the ending in","(RECEIVED, • • ) pattern. We amocla~e a node with each such group. The nodes form a directed graph, called control graph. We associate a node with exception rules group too. One node is selected as a staz~__ing node.
