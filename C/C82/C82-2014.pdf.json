E~ish is a language with relatively rigid word order, a characteristic that has influenced all NLU systems proposed so far. These systems have dedicated only minor attention to problems that are of major importance in lemguagee with a freer ordering like Italian.

In any event, without enough syntax it becomes hard to analyze complex sentences and to explain a number of psycholinguistic phenomena.","2. WEDNESDAY, the system proposed here, is the core of an extended mechanism we are developing and implementing in LISP (flg.1) (see Pariei and Castelfranchi, in press). It is an analyzer with semantic output based on word interpretation. The semantic information brought in by each word is progressively connected to get at the sentence's meaning according to syntactic constraints and expectations. Syntax is a set of instructions directly concerned with assembling semantic units.

Lexical entries are composed of a declarative part and a procedural part. The procedural part is made up of syntactic instructions designed to assemble the declarative (semantic) part of the entry with the declarative parts of the other words in the sentence. The syntactic assembling process","- 66 - allows the construction of the sentence's semantic network to be carried out progressively and so it can also operate on incomplete sentences. Furthermore, the system's output has a format which is homogenous to that of the knowledge base (encyclopedia). This means that as the sentence analysis proceeds, it is natural to have the knowledge base controlling the assembly process top-down, in cooperation with the lexioal- -syntactic analysis. Clauses in multl-clause sentences are conceived as restricted search spaces for the assembly instruc~ tions carried by the words, and the same is true for noun spaces (noun phrases). Part-of-speech word categories are interpreted as procedures for opening and closing spaces as a function of context. Therefore, part of the process is dependent on a recursive (push-down storage) mechanism. On the other hand there is a semantic sentence memory that is transparent to the closed-level system.","Being lexically based, WEDNESDAY can deal in a natural way with idiosyncrasies typical of many words. It can also deal with flexible idioms, i.e. idioms that can vary in morphology, word order, syntactic construction, semantic additions, and synonyms. Their reoo~ition is governed by the individual lexical entries and takes place at +.he assembling level.","Word disambiguation is treated in a non-deterministic way. Syntactically based disambiguation (e.g. the word J~) attempts each reading of an ambiguous word in turn and cancels inappropriate readings by testing them against syntactic well- - formednese criteria. Encyclopaedia based disembiguation (e.g. the word b_~) works through the activation of encyclopaedic nodes by the words in the sentence. It selects that reading of an ambiguous word which activates the node \"better\" connected to the other activated nodes. It should be noted that, our approach, in comparison to Small°s work on Word Expert Parsing (Small, 1980), is characterized by (a) non- -determinism, (b) a more systematic recourse to syntax, (c) a separation of syntactically based word disambiguation from encyclopaedia based word disembiguation. - 67 - _J References","Capelli A., FezTari G., Moretti L., Prodanof I., Stock O. \"An ATN Parser for Italians Some Experiments\".
