The aim of the project is to work out a method of resolving automattca.~ly the anaphorio ~euses of s certain class, in particular those used in formulating interdocumentary croesorefsrenoes in primary leSal texts (statutory texts). By resolving an anaphoric clause of that class we mean the searching cut possibly all of its referends. The t,nplementaticn of the planned method should enable the users of the full text legal data banks to obtain in search operations, 8part from the doCumentS satisfying the requirements defined in the usual querriss, also such documents to which the former explicitly, or even implicitly refer. The project has been planned as one composed of three parts. A report on the results of part I was presented at the Fifth ICCH Conference in Ann Arbor in May 1981. The present text aims at showing the main outlines of the approach applied in part II. To make some aspects of that part clear, however, certain references must be made to part Iv Part llI is, as yet, at the eta~e of preliminary discussions.","2. The general approach applied in the whole of the pro- ~eot is of a semantic kind. It has been assumed, in particular, that at a certain level of generalization all elementary anaphoric clauses of the above class (let us call them the a- -clauses) have in spite of the diversity of their types, an - 273 - analogous semantic structure, which can be represented by the following diagremz the elementary a-clause the anaphoric functor the argument of the anaphoric functor","the standard the specification of the argument of the argument","Consider the following fictitious example of a legal provision in which an elementary a-clause is inherent: \"Art. 56. In cases when the price is to be paid in cash article 44 of the civil code should be applied.\" In art. 56 the a-functor is represented in the surface structure by the phrase \"should be applied\", the argument by the phrase \"article 44\", the standard by the phrase \"article\" and the specification by the phrase \"44\". The role of the a-funot-or is confined to signalizin~ the fact that the clause in question has the illocutionary status of an anaphorlc utterance, while that of the argument (and its immediate semantic oonstituens) consists in carrying information relevant to identifying the referende of that clause. Four types of the elementary a-clauses, in particular the type A (the explicitly addressing), the type D (the deictio), the type R (the implicitly referrlng) and the type S (the semantic) are distingulshed. The distinction corresponds to four types of indication met in the clauses in question. By indication we mean the way in which referends of the a-clause are referred to by it.","3- The operation of automated resolving of an a-clause can be conceived of as composed of four stages. Stage 1 consists in identifying an a-clause of this kind within a definite document (article, paragraph,...), mostly by recognizing - 274 - the phrase representing its a-functor. At the stage 2 certain of the sel~antio properties of the analyzed a-olau~e, relevant for the selection of the most appropriate search procedures, are identified by the program° This sta~e results in the generation of a formula which is a generalized semantic representation of the a@tu~ly analyzed a-clause. Such a formula (the SR-formula) is built in a specific language of semantic representation (the SR-language), which is a l~nguage with a drastically reduced vocabulary and a very simple syntax outlined in part Z° At the stage 2 only the semantic properties accounted for by the specific frame-like interpretation scheme TS are taken into consideration. Stage 3 consists in utilizing the SR-formul~s, generated at the stage 2, in automated selecting the search procedures to be employed at the stage 4. The selection is made from among a set of such procedu~es e~pplied by the corresponding program° At the stage 4 the selected procedures are employed in the process of searching out the referends of the actually analyzed anaphorio clause (i.e. the documents to which it explicitly or implicitly refers).","4. The simplest version of IS, to be used in interpreting the elementary a-clauses, (i.e. the a-clauses in which only a single indication is inherent), can be conceived of as anl ordered pair IT ! R~ , where T stands for a data structu-Ire (called \"the ladder\") composed of 8 subsequent fields (te~ninels) a~d R for a set of rules by which the operation of filling out of definite terminals is governed° According to the rules R two term£n~ls located to the furthest left, are destined to carry infoz~nation on the type of indication inherent in the actually analyzed elementary a-clause. The remaining terminals (3-8) account each for a de~in~te semantic property of such a clause.","5. By composed ~-clauses are meant those in which more than a sin~e indication are inherent. Such clauses are - 275 - semantically represented by the composed fomulas of the SR-languags, in particular by a number of filled out \"ladders\", connected by the use of certain connectives of the classical calculi.","6. The empirical investigations which form the subject of part II were carried cut on a representative sample of the Polish statutory texts of the years 1944 - 1979. The research aimed at reconstructing all possible ways in which the semantic properties of all kinds of a-clauses may be represented in the original texts. Such a reconstruction was indispensable to building the algorithms of transforming the \"natural\" a-clauses into the corresponding SR-formulas, as well as to the building the possibly ~i~ effective procedures of searching out the referend8 of the analyzed a-clauses. The research resulted in formingz a) the lists of words which occur in the phrases representing in the surface structure the correspond£ng semantic constituents of the ~-olansee of all types, b) the lists of words which occur in the phrases reflecting definite semantic properties of such clauses, and c) lists of grammars reconstructing the empirically observed syntactic connections between those words. Such a ws~7 of presenting the results of the empirical investigations inherent in part II seems most suitable for constructing the aforementioned algorithms and procedures.","7. Part III of the project is concerned with the ways of implementing of the planned method. Only a few of the corresponding algorithms and procedures have already been worked cut by the authors. - 276 -"]}]}
