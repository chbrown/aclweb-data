In principle all of them hold for machine translation as well, at least if it is pursued within a theoretical fremework, as e.g. in the case of the project SALAT (of. Hauensohild, 1978) and of the successor project \"Ubersetzungsbezogene Kontexttheorie\" (Context theory for translation) in the spirit of which this paper was written. - 121 -","These considerations lead to the question whether it is necessary to compute the TRS of ever7 translated sentence, which would be very difficult - if at all possible - Eiven the high degree of ambiguity of written texts with respect to the TRS.","We want to propose a somewhat simplified procedure which nevertheless ensures the preservation of the TI~. Theoretically, this procedure is based on a concept of theme and theme that ascribes them a strategic role in communication, controlling, as it were, several other factors (semantic and syntactic). If these latter factors are kept constant during the tra~slation process, we can be sure that we have preserved theme and theme as well (or that the boundary is irrelevant in the given sentence),","The central hypothesis of this paper is the following: in most cases it is sufficient to preserve the underlying (communicatively conditioned) order of main elements, which"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["conceived in a wa~ ve~J"]},{"title":"similar","paragraphs":["to that of"]},{"title":"Sgall","paragraphs":["and Ha-"]},{"title":"JiSov~, 1977/78,","paragraphs":["or Ha~l~ov~,"]},{"title":"1980,","paragraphs":["but without indi@ation of an exact boundaz7 between theme and theme. ~he validity of this hypothesis"]},{"title":"is,","paragraphs":["of course, limited to certain languages (we treat German, French and Russian) and to certain types of texts, aiminE exclusively at an optimal transmission of information.
