The description of the syntactic structure as well as the formal description of the wordfo~ms have to follow a certain model, in our case the Dependency Gre~nme~ by ~NZE (1975)o","A central point of the model - in respect 4o analysis -","ere the so-called bundles. They represent the necessary syntactic knowledge of a language which is the base for analysi~ sentences of this le~guage. The bundles ere parts of trees in a very generalized form. If"]},{"title":"RIR3\"","paragraphs":["N 1 N 2 N 3 is a bundle, then it means, that there are conditions for the nodes NO, N 1, N2, N 3, that there are relations between the • nodes expressed by the edses and their markings R 1 , ~, R 3 and that there is some order condition for the nodes, in the example 1; 1 N 2 N O N 3. Following the model, these bundles give us a high measure of surety, for the analysis. - 244 -","The bundles are stored in the system in a very concentrated form. For example for a noun group with a noun like \"table\" at the top there is only one budle with all possible facultative nodes. So we have in a bundle informations about the mode of occurrence of a node, i.e. if a node is obligatory, facultative etc.","The bundles serve also as description for the dominance behaviour of wordforms (one part of the formal description of their features), thus we have a strong connection between a bundle and a wordformwhich can\"stand\" at the top of the bundle. For this purpose ~he bundles have a special external shape for linguistic work. For instance, a finite verb form of the German verb Sschreiben\" has several bundles in its dominance component, one of these is FIN (ACT°A 0BJ3fA (PAT ~ DAS) °) FIN - means, that the top is a finite verb form ACT ° - there must be an actor (subject) OBJ3 f - there can be an indirect object (PATA DAS) °- there mue__~t be a direct object,","either in the form of a noun group in","\" the accusative case (PAT) or as a sub-","• ordinate clause with the conjunction","\"dase\" (DAS) Free modifications llke local and temporal circumstances are possible as well.","Of course, in the syntactic analysis system the bundles have another shape and~they contain more lnformatione","There are two possibilities to use the bundles for syntactic analysis, the first one is to use them as proper rules, the eeco~ one is to use other methods, but to have the bundles as syntactic knowledge in the back@round. The first possibility is outlined in my dissertation (AROLD 1976) as a strong - 245 - where bottom-up and multiple-path analys£8. But for a working system we intend to follow the second way.","In the paper a short summary of the system will be given. The syntactic analysts, of a sentence ~£ven by the formal description of the syntactic features of the wordforms iS made by three steps. These three steps differ one from the other by d~fferent methods.","In the first step an nau~nented transition network n (ATe) is used to construct a rough structure of the sentence. The second step uses the bundles which are members of t he dominance component of the wordforms to find out so-called subordlnntion possibllitiee. The result of the second step is a loop-free ~raph, which is transformed dur£ng the third step to a ~aph contusing the dependency treem which desor£be the syntactic structures of the an~yeed sentence. In the third step the conditions of the bundles (obligator7 and facultative nodes etc.) are used as well as the condlttonm com£n~ from the shape of the resulting graph.","Up to now we ~re only at the be~nn~ng of the ~nplementation of the system. 3ome remake about these problems am well as about the difficulties to include the analysis of coordtnated sentences w~ll be made in the paper too. - 246 -"]}]}
