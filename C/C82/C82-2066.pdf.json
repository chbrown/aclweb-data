Background","Bede is essentially a research project: we are not immediately concerned with commercial applications, thouek such are clearly p~ssible if the research proves fruitful. Work on Bede at this stage thoueh is primarily experimental. The aim at the moment is to investigate the extent to which a microprocessor-based ~.T. system of advanced design is possible, and the limitations that have to be imposed in order to. achieve a workin 8 system. This paper describes the overall system design specification to which ~ are currently workine.","In the basic design of the system we attempt to incorporate as much as possible features of large-scale ~.T° systems that have proved to be desirable or effective. Thus, Beds is multllingual by design (i.e. not based on language pairs) (of. King,"]},{"title":"1981:12)!","paragraphs":["algorithms and linguistic data are strictly separated (of. Johnson, 1979:140); and the system is designed in more or less independent modules (of° Vauquols, 1965:33) • - 266 -","The microprocessor environment means that oz~Lteria of size are important: data structure both dynamic (created by and maz~pulated during the translation process) and static (dictionaries and linguistic rule packages) are constrained to be as economical in terms of storage space and access procedures as possible,Limitations on in-core and peripheral storage are important considerations in the system design.","In large ~eneral purpose M.T. systems, it is necessary to assume that failure to translate given input correctly is generally not due to incozTectly formed input, but to insufficiently elaborated translation algorithms. This is particularly due to two problems: the lexical problem of choice of ~ppropriate translation equivalents, and the strate~c problem of effective analysis of the wide r~e of syntactic patterns found in natural langu~e. The reduction of these problems via the notions of controlled vocabulary and restricted e~rntax seem particularly appropz~ate in the microprocessor environment, since the alternative of making a system infinitely extendable is probably not feasible. Both notions have been tried w~th bigger systems, resulting both in better results from the M.T. system itself, and in increased leF~Lbility from a human point of view of source texts (cf. Ducro%, 1972! Ellieton, 1978! Lawson, 1979\"81-21 So~ners and McNaught, 1980:49).","Given these constraints, it seems feasible to achieve translation via an \"interlingus\" (cf. Veillon, 1969! Hutchiz~s, 1978z 131), in which the canonical structures from the source lan&n~a~e =are mapped directly onto those of the target lan4gaage(s), avoiding any langua~e-pe~ir oriented \"transfer\" ste4~e. ~=ranslation thus takes place in two phases= analysis of source text and synthesis of target text. 2 t Brief description","A description of the system forms the second half of the proposed paper. For the sake of clarity and brevity in - 267 - this summary, we refer to the attached schematic representation of the translation process in Bede. In the full version o~ this paper, each step is to be outlined in rather more detail.","The analyser uses a chart-like structure (of. Kaplan, 1973) to produce the interface trees of the abstract interlingual representation. These trees serve as input to synthesis, where they are reazTan~ed into valid surface structures for the target ~age.","The source text is translated sentence by sentence (or equivalent). Text is first s.ubJeoted to a two-sta~e morphological analysis. In the first stage the text is compared word by word with a stop-list of frequently occurring words (mostly function words)! words not found in the stop-list undergo morphological analysis, again on a word by word basis. Morphological rules form a finlte-state grammar of affix-strlpping rules (°A rules') and the output is a chart with labelled arcs indicating lexical item and possible interpretation of stripped affixes, as confirmed by dictionary look-up. The morphological analysis phase also creates a temporary \"sentence dlctionary~ consistin~ of copies of the dictionary entries for (only) those lexical items found in the current translation unit.","The chart then undergoes a two-sta~e eyntactico~semantio an~ysis. In the first stage, context-sensitive phrase- -structure rules (\"E rules\") work towards creating a single arc spanning the entire translation unit- arcs are labelled with appropriate syntactic class and syntactico-semantic feature information and a trace of the lower arcs which have been subsumed. In the second stage, the tree structure implied by the labels and traces on these arcs is disjoined from the ~aph and undergoes general tree-to-tree-transduction rules (\"T z~les') resulting in a single tree structure representing the canonical form of the translation unit. With source-language lexical items replaced by unique multilingual-dictionaryj -268 - addresses, this is the interlin6ua which is passed for synthesis into the target language(s).","Synthesis consists of a combination of T rules which reassign new order and structure to the lnterlingua, and of con-text-sensitive rules which can be used to assign mainly syntactic feature labels to leaves (\"L rule~), for example for the purpose of assigning number and gender concord (etc.). The resulting list of labelled leaves (the superi~or branches are no longer needed)is passed to morphological synthesis where a finite-state grsmmar of morphographenLlc and affixation rules produces the target string.","As can be seen, the system is strictly modular, and at each interface only a small part of the data structures used by the donating module is required by the receiving module. The \"unwanted\" data structures are written to peripheral store to enable recovery of partial structures in the case of failure or mistranslation, though automatic back-tracking to previous modules by the system as such is not envisaged as a maj or component.","The \"static\" data Used by the system consist of the different sets of linEulstio rule packages, plus the dictionary. The system essentially has one large multillngual dictionary from which numerous software packages generate various subdlctionarles as required either in the translation process itself, or for lexloographers working on the system. Alphabetioal or other structured language-speciflc listings can be produced, while of course dictionary updating and editing pack~es are also provided. ~ Implementation details","The system will run on any microprocessor system which runs under the CP/M operating system and at C.0.L. is implemented on the Intertec Superbrain with twin ~' double density floppy disk drives, giving a total of 320k bytes of on-llne - 269 - store. Programs are written in Pascal/M (Scrod, 1979), a Pascal dialect closely resembli~ UCSD Pascal."]},{"title":"4%","paragraphs":["References","Ducrot, J.M.
