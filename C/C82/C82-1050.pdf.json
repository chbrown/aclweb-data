The following issues are discussed: (a) explicative power of GS, (b) the time complexity for the analysis and synthesis for GS. INTRODUCTION A generative system for Czech was presented in Sgall [~ . The concept of a generative system was studied by Pl~tek [4] and Pl~tek and Sgall [~ . In this paper we use a similar approach as that presented by Haji~ov~, Pl~tek and Sgall in ~3~ • We define generative systems as a fundamental device for construction of grammars of natural languages. We give here some mathema - tical results to illustrate the usefulness of the new concept. We try first to formulate the necessary requirements on a grammar G of a natural language L. The grammar G must determine: a) The set of all correct sentences of the language L.","The set will be denoted by LC. b. ~he set of the correct structural descriptions (SD) of the","anguage L. SD represents all meanings of all sentences of LC. c) The relation SH between LC and SD. The relation SH describes","the ambiguity and the s~11ony~ of L. By a structural description we understand a dependency tree (D-tree). The concept of a simple translation scheme from [I] is a generalisa - tion of context-tree grammar. We introduce here a similar concept of a translation scheme, in this case as a generalisation of dependency grammar (see [2] , [5~}. A generative system (GS) is defined as a sequence of translation schemes with a special as~etric property. We show that the explicative power of GS increases with the length of GS. We present results concerning on algorithm for the analysis and synthesis of GS and show that its time complexity is independent on the length of GS. Moreover for a given GS we can construct a similar GS, for which a fast algorithm for synthesis exists. Definitions. Notation.

Analogically as a translation scheme of the type string - ~-~ree was defined, also definitions of the type string- string (TS [S,SI ) or of the type D-tree - D-tree (TS [D,D3 ) can be given. By TS [S, Sj the lefthand side and righthand side of a rule is always a string. By TS [D,D] both sides of a rule are always D-trees. As TS we denote the set of all translation schemes of all the three types.","Def. Let TI,... ,Tn be a sequence of TS. We denote as TR(T~,...,Tn)=TR(TI).TR(T2)...TR(Tn).

Remarks. Remark to Assertion I. We sketch here a proo'~ of Ass. i. We see that DR o ~ DR I an~ IDR o d IDR I. DLkovskij an~ Medina have shown in [ 2~ , that TR (T3) from Example I cannot be in DRo~ We see that T3 is a TS. Thus DR O~DR I. Since ~R(T3) is a function , we see that IDR o ~ IDR I. 318 M. PLATEK In the Example 2 we have shown that IT(k) ~ IDR~. Prom the results on composition of pushdown transducers (PST) in ~ \"4~ and from the equivalence theorem between TS's and PST's from _i it follows, that IT(k+l) ~ DRk . Thus DRj ~ DRj+ 1 and IDRj - 1DRj+ 1. Remark to Assertion 2. The algorithm for analysis and synthesis for a GS is based on the idea of Cocke-You~ger-Kasami algorithm. Por a seguence of simple translation schemes of the type string-string the algorithm is presented in Suchomel E7J . The difference between the upper boundary of the time complexity of the full synthesis and analysis is given by the asymmetric property of a GS. Remark t 9 Assertion 3. The basic idea of the proof is a construction of a new GS to GSI. The new GS, denoted GS2, has full information in the alphabets for a straightforward algorithm for a full synthesis. Remark to Assertion 4. The idea of the proof is a~alogous to that of Assertion 3. When we have a partition of Dom(TR(GSI)) in the clases of synonymous sentences, the function of minimal synthesis chooses always only one representant of his class. Therefore the algorithm can be so fast. Conclusion remarks. When formulating a grammar for natural language, we can use with advantage the modularity of GS. We have shown that the time complexity of the analysis and synthesis for DRj, j >_ 2 is independent on ~. Otherwise the explicative power of DR.. is increasing with j. We have also shown, that to any generative ~system there can be con - structed an h-morphic generative system with the full information for a fast algorithm of the minimal synthesis.
