Introduction","The efficiency of syntactic analysis by using a set of rewriting rules is greatly influenced by the order or the arrangement of the rules for the application. There are some trials which subdivide the set of rules into subsets and specify the sequence of rule applications, thus avoiding the useless rule applicagions [i]. But the subdivision of the rule set and the specification of the sequence of rule applications are not so easy for the establishment of the most efficient analysis system.","We have developed a rewriting rule system which can manipulate arbitrary list of trees. The control mechanism of this system can adjust the weight of the rewriting rules, and can analyze the most plausible sentential structure f t, thus realizing the fast syntact analysis. The system learns (so to s[ ) the weight of importance of the reutiting rules during the analysis of~ input sentences. I. Objectives of the Parser We designed a new syntactic analy-","sis system (a parser) with the follow-","ing objectives.","(i) The function of rewriting rules must be powerful enough to handle a list of trees and to express transformational rules,","(2) All the possible sentential structures must be obtained for an input sentence in the sequence that the most plausible one is analyzed first.","(3) The analysis must be efficient enough for practical applications.","(4) The syntactic parser must have a learning mechanism as to the application sequences of rewriting rules to obtain the efficiency of analysis. 2. Method of Analysis","The input data for this parser is assumed as a word sequence which is the output of a morphological analysis. The output from this parser is a tree structure. The analysis is controlled by the best-first graph-searching technique about the rule applications. 2.1. Description of Rewriting Rules","The rewriting rules transform a list of trees into a list of trees. An example of the rewriting rule in this parser is shown in Fig. 1. It shows that if there is a symbol sequence composed of a tree not-V(erb), a tree N(oun) P(hrase), a tree C(ase-particle), and a tree not-A(dverbial)-P(article) in this order, this is transformed into a tree NP-C.

The basic score is a static weighting measure which ~eflects the importance of a rule co~- pared to the other ruleG of the same category. The basic score is adjusted by a learning process which will be explained in section 3. The 'fittedness function gives a dynamic weighting measure which expresses the fittedness of the rule application to a sentential structure. The function is a user-defined one which can use the data in both the right side and the left sides of the rewriting rules.","The basic score and the fittedness function are used for the sequence control of rule applications in the best-first graph-searching, which is the essential strategy to get the most plausible structural analysis first. 2.2.

Pruning Rule","This parser is essentially a bottom-up parser, and there are cases that unnecessary expansions are executed. To minimize such unnecessery expansions, we introduced a mechanism of pruning such unnecessary nodes by certain pruning ~ules.
