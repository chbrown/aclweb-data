The DIALOGIC system translates English sentences into representations of their literal meaning in the context of an utterance. These representations, or \"lngical forms,\" are intended to be a purely formal language that is as close as possible to the structure of natural language, while providing the semantic compositionality necessary for meaning-dependent computational processing. The design of DIALOGIC (and of its constituent modules) was influenced by the goal of using it as the core language-processing component in a variety of systems, some of which are transportable to nee domains of application. OVERVIEW The DIALOGIC system translates Engllsh sentences into representations of their literal meaning in the context of an utterance. These representations, or \"logical forms,\" are intended to be a purely formal language that is as close as possible to the structure of natural language, while providing the semantic compositionality necessary for meanlng-dependent computational processing. The design of DIALOGIC (and of its constituent modules) was influenced by the goal of using it as the core language-processlng component in a variety of systems, some of which are transportable to new domains of application. Currently DIALOCIC is a core component of four systems being developed within several different research projects at SRI. One is the TEAM project, ~ whose goal Is to provide natural-language access to large data bases through systems that are easily adaptable to a wide range of new applications. Another, the RLAUS project, ~ is a longer-range effort to address basic research problems in natural-language semantics, commonsense reasoning, and the pragmatics. A third,project is investigating the problem of providing natural-language access to text. ~ A fourth, in which ~IALOGIC also plays an important role, is examining the development of formal grammars. 5 DIALOGIC is divided into five modules coordinated by the DIAMOND executive system. DIAMOND is a modification of the executive system used in the SRI speechunderstanding project [Walker 1978] and also in a task-dialogue interpretation I Now working at Machine Intelllgence Corporation in Sunnyvale, California. 2 Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract N00039-80-C-0645. 3 Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract N00039-80-C-0575. 4 Funded by the Nations1 Library of Medicine under Grant IROI-LM03611. 5 Sponsored by the National Science Foundation under Grant IST-8103550. 95 96 B. GROSZ et .1. system [A. Robinson, 1980]. It provides the formal language for defining the grammar and the control for parsing English sentences and translating them into loglcal-form expressions. The five modules are (1) the DIAGRAM grammar; (2) s set of semantic translators; (3) a set of basic semantic functions; (4) a scoping algorithm (for quantifiers and sentence operators); (5) a set of basic pragmatic functions. The remainder of this paper describes these components of DIALOCIC and presents an example illustrating how they coordinate in the interpretation of an utterance. A description of the logical form that is the target of DIALOGIC's interpretation processes may be found in [Moore, 1981]. DIAGRAM DIAGRAM is a general grammar of English. It now contains about 125 rule schemata, equivalent to about 800 individual rules. These define all common sentence typos, complex auxiliaries and models, complex noun phrases, nominalized sentences, all the common quantifiers, relative clauses, verbs with sentential complements, comparative and measure expressions, subordinate clauses and other adverbial modifiers. Conjunction, however, is limited to a few place-holders, pending further study of the problems it poses for constraining the number of syntactic analyses. A detailed description of DIAGRAM is contained in [J. Robinson, 1982]. Formally, DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase-structure grammar. The lexicon categorizes words and associates attributes with them that are used in the rules. Each rule has associated with it a constructor that expresses the constraints on its application and also a translator (described in the next section) that produces the corresponding logical form. Phrases inherit attributes from their constituents and acquire attributes from the larger phrases that contain them. These attributes are used to impose context-sensitive constraints upon the acceptance of an analysis. Before constructing a node in the parse tree corresponding to the application of a rule, the executive invokes the rule's constructor to test for admissibility. In addition to accepting or rejecting a rule application, the constructors can assign scores that allow listing alternative analyses in a preferred order. The result of applying the grammar to analysis of an input is one or more annotated ~arse trees. Attributes and annotations are not limited to syntactic information. The translators, described next, specify bow the translation of a phrase into logical form is to be defined in terms of the attributes of the words and phrases that compose it. This coupling of syntax and semantics (for which attribute ~rammars [Tienari 1980] were originally designed) is convergent with current formal theories bf natural language that advocate constructing a syntax and semantics that \"work in tandem\" [Dowry et el. 1981; Kaplan and Bresnan (to appear); Gazdar (to appear); Landsbergen 1976.] Future work on DIAGRAM includes efforts to extend both its coverage and its formalism. In extending the formalism, our dual objective is to capture certain linguistic generalizations (e.g., dative movement) and to make the task of developing a large grammar more manageable. To accomplish this, we are exploring the use of metarules [Gazdar to appear]. TRANSLATORS Followlng the syntactic analysis of an utterance, a sequence of semantic translators is invoked to -build the loglcal form that corresponds to a llteral interpretation of the utterance in context. The translator for each phrase-structure rule specifies how the various constituents of the phrase are to be combined to form an interpretation of the wbol~ phrase. It prescribes the predicate-argument structures that correspond to the grammatical construction or, more generally, the operator-operand structures. D1ALOGIc, A CORE-NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM 97 Although the translators operate top-down (the translator for each node inyokes the translators for its children), the translation is in effect built bottom-up-- since, typically, the first thing a translator for a nonterminal node does is to invoke the translators for each of its constituents, usually left to right. However, the top-down nature of the translation process is significant, because it means that information located above a node and to its left is available when the node is translated. In addition to producing the logical form, the translators determine the syntactic constraints upon and preferences for either coreference or noncoreference of noun phrases, especially pronouns, following an algorithm described in [Hobbs, 1976]. BASIC SEMANTIC FUNCTIONS To insulate changes in the grammar from those that occur in logical form, the construction of the latter is isolated from the translator procedures by calls on basic semantic functions [Konollge, 1979]). The actual construction of a logical form is done in two phases: (I) ioglcal-form fragments (iffs) are attached to the parse tree by the basic semantic functions; (2) the final logical form is assembled from these by the scoplng algorithm. Lffs are assigned only to certain\" nodes in the parse tree. Usually the iff at an NP node will encode the properties held by the entity the NP describes [e.g., \"X such that EMPLOYEE(X) & OLD(X)\" for \"old employee\"] and the fragment for a clauselevel construction (e.g., a VP) will encode the predlcate-argument structure of the clause, The basic semantic functions also leave markers on the parse tree to indicate such things as the type of quantifier or deter~iner associated with a noun phrase. These markers are used by the scoplng algorithm to determine the final loglcal form for the utterance. (Note that the Iffs and markers left by the basic semantic functions may be viewed as further annotations to the parse tree.) DIALOGIC currently includes eleven basic semantic functions. Six of these do most of the work of buildlng lffs for standard noun phrases and clauses. The others are concerned with adding such things as mode, degree, and adverbial modification to clauses. As more precise specifications are defined for encoding these phenomena in logical form, we expect to collapse some of this latter group. SCOPING OF QUANTIFIERS AND OTHER SENTENTIAL OPERATORS The scoplng algorithm is designed to collect the loglcal-form fragments from the parse tree and produce the possible scoplngs of quantlflers and other scoped operators. The scoplng algorithm used in DIALOGIC (adapted from that in Hendrlx, 1978) produces all the scoplngs thnt do not vlolate the hard rules of Engllsh scoplng, and then ranks them according to a score computed by a set of speciallst critics. Each critic is a function that returns a score for some aspect of the conflicting rules of quantification in Engllsh; e.g., the left-rlght scope critic lowers the score of 8coplngs that involve permuting the left-outermost default ordering of quantlflers. All critics receive equal weight in the present implementation, but the design of the system does allow for differential weighting. The current set of critics is concerned with such things as changes in sentence order and the relatlve scoplng of quantlflers of different strengths. The scoplng of nonstandard quantlflers and of the generallzed negative (\"not, .... no one,\" \"nothing, .... none\") remain to be done. BASIC PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS Basic pragmatic functions are intended to fulfill several roles in DIALOGIC, all concerned with certain kinds of indetermlnacles in logical form whose resolution requires pragmatic information. The four primary uses of basic pragmatic 98 B. GROSZ et -1. functions in the current system are (i) ~o provide a context-speclflc interpretation of certain terms that have only vague meanings in themselves (e.g., prepositions llke \"of\" and \"~n~\" or Inherently vague verbs llke"]},{"title":"\"have\"); (2)","paragraphs":["to establlsh the specific relationship underlying any given noun-noun combination; (3) to identify the referents of pronouns; and (4) to interpret a limited range of metonymy (e.g., the use of \"blonds\" to mean \"people with blond hair\"). At present, only a small core of pragmatic functions is implemented, each of which handles only a subset of the cases it is intended to cover. EXAMPLE To illustrate how the different modules' of DIALOGIC contribute to the interpretation of an utterance, we shall consider the example, \"What SRI employees have children older than 15 years?\" The logical form for this query--the target for the interpretation processes--Is (lowercase is used to indicate variables, uppercase to indicate constants and predicates): [QUERY (WH employeel (AND (EMPLOYEE employeel)","(EMPLOYEES-COMPANY-OF employeel SRI))","(SOME child2 (CHILD child2) (AND (CHILD-0F employeel child2)","((*MORE* OLD) child2 (YEAR 15] This corresponds rou@hly to a formal representation for \"who is each employee such that the company of the ~nployee is SRI and some child of the employee is older than fifteen years?\" During DIAMOND'S parsing phase, the parse tree in Figure I is constructed. At this polnt~ the attributes annotating the tree encode such properties as the type of noun (count, mass~ unit) and syntactic number. These attrlbutes have been used during the parsing phase to rule out certain alternative structures. Once this structure is built, the translators are invoked. In combination with the basic semantic functions, the translators assign addltlonal attributes to nodes in the tree, encoding such information as the quantlflers (type~ strength, and the variables they bind) and heads of noun phrases. For example~ the head of the WHNP, \"what SRI employees\"m is a variable of type EMPLOYEE that 14 bound by a wiT-type quantifier. Attributes also encode the underlying predlcate-argument structures for verb phrases and adJectlves~ and the iffs to be used in constructing the flnal logical form for the utterance. In the sentence of Figure I, the nodes WHNP and S are annotated as being quantlfledp WHNP with a wh-type quantifier and S as a \"query.\" Although every rule has an associated translator, only some of these result in iffs being attached to nodes. For this example~ the nodes marked with *e in the original parse tree are the only ones for which Iffs are produced. The fragment attached to each of these nodes is as follows: NOUN1 (*NN* employeel SRI) NOUN2 (EMPLOYEE employee1 ) PREDICATE (*HAVE employee1 child2) NOUN3 (CHILD child2) NCOMP ((*MORE* OLD) child2 (YEAR 15)) EMPLOYEE, CHILD, and OLD are\" monadlc predicates that are part of the conceptual model of the domain. *MORE e maps a predicate into a comparative along the scale corresponding to the predicate. *NN* and *HAVE are dummy predicates that indicate the need tO invoke the basic pragmatic functions. After the translation process is complete, the final loglcal form is asseLbled by a procedure that considers alteruatlve quantifier scoplngs (using the quantifier-DIALOGIC, A CORE-NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM 99 /","I /---- --\\","MSDET NO~D","I","NOUHI **","I","/ \\","NHD NOUN2 **","[ -S N / VPT t V 4 J I","\\.WHAT SRI '-S B~q,OYEE HAVE -'8 / \\ SNHQ ENDPUNCT J i","? / m t NorM3 ** f /----~","-S N","PREDICATE ** t VP I","\\","NP [","\\","NCONFS","t","NCOMP *t","f","PREDADJ","I /~ -------~ ADJT I i / \\ /------ ~\\","ER ADJ THAN f I I I I I /-- I I i I I I","CHILD ER OLD THAN l$ HP f DETP J DEI'Q I ImUN","i /---- ---~ • \"-S B I i -..S YEAR Figure I Parse Tree for \"What SRI employees have children older than 15 years?\" related annotations left on the parse tree) and invokes the basic pragmatic functions as needed. The basic pragmatic functions use information in the conceptual model of the domain to transform (*HN* employeel SRI)--corresponding to the noun-noun compound \"SRI employee\"--into (EMPLOYEE-OF employeel SRI) and (*HAVE employeel child2) into (CHILD-OF employeel child2). The nodes with either quantifier or ioglcal-form markings are the only ones considered by the TEAM scoplng algorithm. Besides the WH quantifying employee1, TEAM recognizes that a default existential quantifier must be created for child2~ so SOME is added. The scope rules force QUERY to have the widest scope; this position 18 contested only if there are multiple sententlal markers. Both orderlngs of the WHAT and SOME quantlflers are generated. The two resultlng quantified statements correspon d to (WHAT employeel (SOME child ...)...) and (SOHE child (WHAT employee ...)...) Next the scope critic functions evaluate the different scoplngs; only three of the critics are relevant. One critic considers the left-right node ordering and prefers the first scoplng because it comes closer to the surface form, One critic prefers scoplngs in which WH outecopes an adjacent exlstential; it too upgrades the score of the first and downgrades the score of the second. The other critic knows that default existential quantlflers need the narrowest possible scope; it too selects the first. 100 B. GROSZ et al. SUMMARY Because of the modularlzation in D~ALOGIC, changes in one part of the system reverberate very little in other components. Changes in the constraints imposed on the phrase-structure rules in the grammar have no effect on any other part of the system. A change in a rule itself necessitates a change in the corresponding translator, but the basic semantic functions do not need to be revised. Similarly, a change in the logical form or in the data structures within which it is implemented requires a corresponding change in the basic semantic functions, but not in the grammar or translators. In addition to extending DIALOGIC as mentioned in the foregoing sections, we are also investigating possible revisions of the translation phase (as currently performed by the translators and basic semantic functions) to allow translation into loglcal form to be specified declaratlvely. In this new approach [Rosenscheln and Shleber (to appear)[, loglcal types are associated with the phrasal categories, and the translation of a phrase is synthesized from the translations of its immediate constituents according to a local rule, which typically involves functional application.","REFERENCES","Dowty, D.
