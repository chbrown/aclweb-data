The system is being elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics at the Institute of Mathematics with Computer Center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The desorlbed system requires:","I. A form~ description of the syntax of basic nuclear structures of the natural lanEuage sentences which has to be used during the process of syntactical analysis of the users\" phrases in a natural language~","2. Techniques for representing in the computer the knowledge about a given problem area. The obtained description has to be used during the process of semantical analysis of the users\" phrases in a natural language!","3. A dictionary containing the terms used in the chosan problem area. The dictionary is compiled by specialists in the given problem area;","4e A dictionary containing the eel-vice vocabulary (in-dependent of a particular problem area) - word-groups as \"less than\", \"geater than\", \"equal to\", \"slid\", \"or\", \"as... ash etc. 5.

Translation from a language close to the natur~al one into the internal software system's language for description or processing the data;","2.

The structural description of the prob~ lem area is a network designed for the representation of the problem area semantics and is viewed as a static, inmoblle and determinative tool for \"understanding\" and accomplishing the dialogue. The syntactical analysis does not presume a full scanning of the input sentence. It involves analysis of syntactical dependences at different levels with respect to the problem area complexity and, naturally, to the input phrase complexity. By means of an elaboration of the formal description of Bulgarian syntax, an improvement of the techniques for syntactical analysis is envisaged.","When workir~ out the principles of construction of linguistic processors, some peculiarities of the Bulgarian lan~age have been taken into account, namely, its flexiona~ character, the absence of a case system, free word-order, etc.","The approach proposed for the realization of the man - computer dialogue in a natural language allows to process problem areas with different complexity. Linguistics processors at two levels are bein~ elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics - for access of users - nonprogr~mnere to a relational data base in Bulgarian l~ags and for access of users - nonprogrammere to the facilities for stat-Istloal analysis proposed by the program package ]~DI ) Bulgarian language o - 225 -"]}]}
