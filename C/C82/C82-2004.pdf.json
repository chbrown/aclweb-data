There exist only two of the same class! Japanese and Korean. Japanese is written both in Chinese characters (ideograph) and in Kana (Katakana and HAragana - phonetlo symbols) In mixture without any space. Moreover, 0hineee characters in Japanese have, in most cases, several readtngs and play several roles depending on the context and letter string characteristics. So for written Japanese, it wan very difficult to ee~nent letter string and extract adequate terms from sentence and to gave them correct readings automatically, which a~e indispensable for terminology, automatic reading, automatic indexing, key-boarding from on-line terminals otherwise more than 2,000 character key-board As necessary.","The authors invented efficient algorithm and :developed computer programme and dictionaries for successful solution of the problems above for the first time in Japan.","The system consists of two subsystems called K-KACS (Kan~i-Kana Automatic Conversion System) and JAEAS (Japanese Keyword Automatic Selection).","Some Chinese characters act both as suffix, preffix or preposition and as parts of meaningful words. We comprehensive- - 21 - ly collected such characters (about 500) and those terms in Which the characters are included not as fixes or prepositions but as important part (about 8000 words). Letter string which is matched with dictionary term is passed but the letter remained and coincides with the special character itself is cutv","In case of long letter string without such special letter, sentence is out by those terms of dictionary which are thought to be definite within reasonable amount. That iss dog liver nucleus DNase indefinite type of word. definite type of word.","Equally, among the varlety of readlngs - in some oases more than 8 - some are speelel and definite and others ~re indefinite but obey to rules.
