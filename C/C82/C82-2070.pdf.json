The translation problem which has been most resistant tO term bank assistance~ however, is that of identifying precisely those translations which are appropriate for a given term in a SL text. This is compounded by the related problems of SL homonymy and polysemy and TL synonymy. The greatest challenge at the text level is dynamically specifying the lexicon used in the subl~age of a document. The solution to this problem depends somewhat on whether terminology is held in one large bank, whic h promotes sharing and comprehensiveness, or in many smaller banks, whiohencoura - ges independence and specialization.","The principle approach to the translation identification problem heretofore has consisted in filtering out irrelevant translations on the basis of such accompanying documentation as subject field, source indication, or grammatical code. Some organizations have developed initial capabilities for pooling or threading in order to deal with the sublanguage problem. ~ refers to the creation of internally cohesive subinventories of a data base. Threadin~ refers to the ability to specify (and access) a logical file made up of a sequence of pools, in wb_ic~ the logical keys are associated with physical records on a flrst-hit basis. - 287 -"]},{"title":"OuT","paragraphs":["paper further elaborates those concepts and discusses their utility in term banks designed to support translation.","Pools may be organized on any functional principle. They may reflect the admAnistrating body - from standards or~anAzation through oompan~ divis¢on to individual translator. Or they may reflect a domain of application - from technical field through company product line to chapter in operations manual. 3oms pools are created to override other more general pools, such as SL or TL dialect pools which preempt standard..langus~e pools.","The object of threadin~ is the dynsunic creation of logical files speoift\"cally tailored to ~he applications at hand° Y~aportant features of threading include the ability to access a select battery of pools~ the ability to prioritizs these pools by their task relevance, ,typically in a sequence from most specific to most general, and the ability, in interactive applications, to modify logical file records by granting read/ write access to one or more"]},{"title":"leading","paragraphs":["pools in the operative sequence° Application programs utilize one of 'three for~ of aocessz s£n~e access, which retrieves data solely from the first sequenced pool in which a term appears! multiple access, which makes data available from any of the sequenced pools in whiOh a term appears! and composite access, a special case of multiple access which constructs a data complex from the full set of sequenced pools in which a term appears..
