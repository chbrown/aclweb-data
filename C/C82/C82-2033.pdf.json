HavrAuek Center of Biomathematics, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, 142 20 Prague 4, Vidensk~ 1083, Czechoslovakia","The aim of the paper is to discuss several issues that usually occur when computational linguistics comes into interactions with so rapidly growing s~eas of artificial intelligence as it can be seen e.g. in designing expert and consulting systems or in the area of automated programming of knowledge- -based problem solving systems. We will mention here problems of communicating knowledge between machine and researcher (a user of a system) which is not an expert in programming techhiquev Since natural lan~a~e is a \"natural\" form for expresstng knowledge (and most extramathematical knowledge actually exists in this form) it could be seemed that natural language would be also the best support for communicating knowledge through a cognitive process performed on a computer. Is It really so? We want to bring arguments for a rather opposite claim by pointed ou~ several formats for expressing and communtoatin~ scientific knowledge which differs from usual natural"]},{"title":"language","paragraphs":["oneso","What kinds of data structures for expressing knowledge and for representing it in a computer memory we need? For answering this question we have to disti~p-ish at least two roles of a user in the process of conmmnication with machine. First of them can be called a speaker t It characterizes the situation in which the user loads knowledge into a machine. For such a situation there is important that knowledge enter- - 142 - ing a computer should be precise and exact as much as possible. So the data structures should enable disambtguation of information. Such a requirement leads naturally to hard constraints of input formats. On the other hand, not only for the user convenience, it should be desirable to allow highly free format of input information to avoid any apriori limitations. Thus, the system should be equipped by an effective interpreter transforming various kinds of input information into internal representation suitable for potential reasoning processes. The second role of the user in communication with computer can be called a listener~ This situation is rather different from the first one. Here the user has to understand results of computations and (especially in Oonsulting systems) also various explanations resulting from reasoning processes. These two roles can, of course, infiltrate one into another. Analogous roles can be recognized for a machine, too.","As a teethed for our considerations an AI problem-oriented designed for an automatic data analysis (called GUHA-80) has been chosen. The task of GUHA-80 system is to generate and develop interesting views onto given empirical data (recognize tnterestin~ logical patterns). These views should represent relevant information contained in the data and be useful for formation of hypotheses.","From the point of view of two above mentioned roles of user the following types of information in the GUHA-80 system could be disttn&-tttshed:","1. Information coming into system could contain a) data (observations on objects), b) supporting knowledge (apriort knowledge about the problem in question, answers of questions).","2. Information coming from the system could contain a) trace of computations and reasoning activities, b) results of computations, c) explanations (why such and such operations have been performed), cf. ~CIN. -"]},{"title":"143 -","paragraphs":["Let us give a hypothetical example of user's communication with GUHA-80 system:","GUHA-80: by a sing~le linkage method using euclidian distance on the set of objects the following dendro~am expressing the similarity between these objects was obtained: AnX CDX","Is the dendogram in accordance with your knowledge?
