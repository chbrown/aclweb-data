Andreweht shenko Faculty of N~erical Mathematics and Cybernetics, lfosoow State University, U3SR","Computational Linguistics is a sphere of science and its applications lying between ltn~zlsttos and computer science. The main taBk of computationaZ lin~istics is developing methods and design~u K tools for man-machine oonnnunication° To this task its two main directions are subordinated= natura~ language data processing, including machine translation, and automation of linguistic research, Including automatic le~Loog~aphT. The formation of computation~l linguistics requires designing a unified language, z~ch enouKh to satisfy diverse computational conditions arising in the above-mentioned applications e","As such a language we propose LZCOL CZ~nKua COmputationum ~Lngu£sticszsnn), an inevitably short review of which is given in the present report. The l~Lstic approach to the desiKn of this language consists in view~n~ it as a 8en~iotic system and forming its unite in accordance with R. Jekobson's linguo-se~iotic functions.","LZCO T. is ~.utendsd for conmnln£cstion between man (native speaker, user) end computer (interpreter of this language) in communicative situations of automatic and automatised (user directed) natu~s£ 18z~uaKe data process~. The concepts and constructions of LICOL presuppose a rather broad range of users - from nonprofessional ones (translators, lsy~co~p~aph - ere, editors, etc.) to computational linguists and traditional prosrsI~ez'8° LIOOL can be used as a command la~,u~e in","- 17 - information retrieval, as a data description and data manipulation language in data base design and as a programming lan6uage in the usual sense. It is intended as means for defining and control both in dialogical ('on-line) and in batch (off- -line) processing.","As a semiotic system LICOL consists of signs - bilateral entities - composed by sig~lfiants (sequences of letters) and signifi6s - those entities of real or conceptual world which are objects and/or means for automatic processing. The role of signlfi6s in this language can be played by the sig~.ifiants and by the signs of the same language. This \"world of lan~a6e\" we name the system of its concepts the relations of which are expressible in terms of relations between the signs of the language. To use LICOL, specificalXy to program in this lan6uage, is to express one's thou~ht, knowledge, notions in the framework of the \"world of LICOL\" in accordance with the rules of its grammar (syntax). In this language the function-ar~nnnant form is chosen as means for ~ statin~ relations between the concepts: suffixal compound stems and prefixal and/or suffixal incorporated synta6m8 , the part of the suffixes bein 6 played by names of operations. The notation of LICOL therefore has the retersed Polish form.","Since LICOL is a language for computation, the main concept of its \"world\" (i.e. the main sign of its semiotic system) is the notion of Computational Construction (CC). The CCs are constructional material both for the prO~TSme and the data, the underlying form for which are IC trees. Since the trees are easily representable in a linear form by means of the Polish form of notation, it is natural to interpret proteins as data and vice versa, the data being fractured into relationally-hierarchical data network. This allows to consider the data base also as a data base for procedurally represented knowledge and therefore not to draw distinctions between the two main forms of data representation - a naming and a procedural one. - 18 -","Aocoz.11ng to the type of signlfla,~ts the COs axe dlvlded into rep:esentln8 and processing co-structions, each of which are further subdivided: the representing class into names and pictures and the processing class into controllers and operations. If the si~Lfiant is, semiottcally, a symbol, we have to do with a namin~ construction, if it is an icon, we have a picture construction! the index-sign represents either a controller or an operational construction. The signifi6e for' the CCs are the so-called descriptions consisting of 'a descriptor (which corresponds to the concept of the sign) and of its referent (value).","According to the type of signifi#s the CCe are divided into real, virtual and notational constructions. The real CCe CozTespond to external data of the usual programming langua~. ee. They are structured into elements, chains, fields, records, fragments, sets and bases. The virtual OCs correspond to the user's notions of processing and are structured into atoms, sequences, trees, ~un6hes (arbitrary graphs), blocks, files and (file) systems. The notional CCe correspond to conetitutive parts of entitles of si~mtfiante. These are: letters, strings, groups (of strings), segments, modules, corpus and packets (of texts).","Acco~ding to the form of value the CCs can be subdivided into scalars, vectors and lists. The scalar CCs have the following typess numbers, codes, logicals, figures, symbols, keys, references, descriptors and masks. The notion of the vector corresponds to one of array, its components may be not only scalars but also vectors or lists, provided their components are of the same type. The lists may consist of sealers, vectors or subliste which may be of route, tree, structure or executive type.","Such multibase classification of the CCs has the following sense. The operations of LICOL are defined on the viz'tual CCs having ve.z\"J.Ous origins- either netational (textual) - 19 - constituents or denotational, virtual and real CCs. They may be intended either for displaying in textual form, or they may be used in further processing as virtual ones, or they may be transmitted in external environment in the form of real CCe.","The CCs can be defined either by description of their type and the mode of evaluating or by a picture, the simplest type of which is a literal. Two or more CCs can be associated together one of them being an object and the rest of its features. There are the following possibilities: implicit transformation of data from one type into another; indirect definitions of operands! participation in operations by objects and their features both separately and Jointly! evaluation of the operands via pictu~s, the operands may be the-reby procedures. Diverse operations on sequences, sets, graphs with labelled and unlabelled nodes and arcs are defined. This allows operating both on the constituents and dependences, to form both the paradi~ns and synta~ms, to examine alternatives and to control thAs processing by putting diverse conditions and restrictions on evaluating objects by pictures without explicit description of the processing sequence. Specifically, some operations on files and systems can be immediately interpreted as operations on dictionaries.","The system of unite in LICOL is defined by a system of linguosemiotioal functions, i.e. it is necessarily close to the structure of functions of natural langunge, specific features of programming are taken into consideration. This allows to proceed from expressions in a natural language to expressions in LICOL, i.e. the highest function is fulfilled, the mstalan~e~e function, the existence of which is ensured by the fulfilment of lower functions: the cognitive one, the oo--nunicative one etc. - 20 -"]}]}
