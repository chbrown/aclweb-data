It is shown that a loop-free tree directed grammar can be transformed into an equivalent top-down tree transducer, and from this fact it follows that given an arbitrary context-free language as input, a tree directed grammar produces an output language which is at most context-sensitive. INTRODUCTION Within the natural language information system PLIDIS [6] a semantic processor was implemented for the translation of syntactically analyzed sentences into expressions of a predicate calculus-orlented internal representation language. This semantic processor was designed according to a translation grammar defined by Wulz [8], which is similar to the transformation grammar introduced by Chomsky [3]. The operations on trees which are defined in thetransformation grammar, i.e. deletion, insertion, and transposition of subtrees, are also available in the Wulz grammar. Therefore it can be assumed that it is equivalent to the transformation grammar with regard to the input/output-relation. But when the Wulz grammar was realized within PLiDIS for a section of German, only of a few of its possibilities was made use. No real transformation was prescribed by the PLIDIS translation rules, they only checked the parse tree and produced an output separated from this tree. Thus, what was realized in the PLIDIS translation rules can be better described by another kind of translation grammar, namely the tree directed grammar (TDG). When we investigate the TDGs and their relation to tree transducers it turns out that they are less powerful than transformation grammars. TREE DIRECTED GRA~tMARS We define trees in the manner of [2] and [7] as mappings from tree domains (special subsets of N*, where N is the set of natural numbers) into an alphabet Z and call them therefore trees \"over\" Z. We assume for the rest of the paper that Z is ranked. Because trees are flnlte mappings it is convenient to identify a tree with its graph. So e.g. the set {<(),a>,<(O),b>,<(1),d>,<(2),a>,<(O,O),e>,<(O,1),c>, <(2,O),d>,<(2,1),b>,<(2,2),e>,<(O,1,0),e>,<(2,1,O),c>, <(2,1,1),d>,<(2,1,0,O),d>}","represents the tree of fig. I. 77 78 W.

DOM(al,b I) ̂(NDOM*(bl,e I) v LFT(bl,dl)) The semantics of a structural condition is defined in the usual way by an interpreting function from the condition into a semantic domain. Here, the trees of T are semantic domains. The four predicates DOM, ...,LFT • are always interpreted in the same way, and this interpretation should be obvious.

It is easy to see that not every TDTT can be transformed into an equivalent TDG, because the TDTTs have the states as an additional means to direct derivations. In some cases the derivation can be directed by appropriate structural conditions in the same way as it is done by states, but i~ is easy to construct examples where this is impossible. On the other hand, each TDG can be transformed into an equivalent TDTT. The main step of this transformation is to put together some of the productions so that the resulting productions satisfy the condition that all symbols of the structural condition part except a I are situated below the symbolu I in each tree, where a I correspond~ to the first component of the @roduction. Take e.g. the productions","([al],DOM(al,bl),[bl][bl])","([bl],DOM(bl,X I) ̂LFT(el,xl),H[Xl])","([Cl],DOM(Xl,C I) a LFT(xl,x 2) ̂DOM*(x2,el),[el]E ) The first and the second production satisfy the condition, the third one does not, because the nodes assigned to x I and x~ are above that one assigned to c I in each tree which satisfies the §tructural condition. But we ca~ put together the second and the third production and get a new one: ([bl],DOM(bl,C 1) ̂LFT(el,c I) ̂LFT(bl,X 2) ̂DOM*(x2,el),"]},{"title":"H[el]E)","paragraphs":["NOW this production is \"better\" than the third above, but it does not yet satisfy our condition. Therefore we put it together with the first one and get","([al],DOM(al,b I) ̂DOM(bl,c I) ̂LFT(el,c I) ̂LFT(bl,X 2)","̂DOM*(x2,el),H[el]EH[el]E) This production is acceptable and together with the production","([el],TRUE,AR) it performs the same derivation as the four productions above. The productions resulting from this transformation process are all proceeding downward in a tree. Each of them can be transformed into a TDTT of its own and finally these single TDTTs are composed to one TDTT which is equivalent to the TDG. The transformation process sketched above can be made only if the TDG is loop-free. That means that each node of a tree is passed during a derivation in TDG at most once. Now we can adopt the result of Baker [I] about top-down tree transductions. It states that the family of the images of recognizable sets of trees (e.g. the set of derivation trees of a context-free grammar) under a top-down transduction is properly contained in the family of deterministic context-sensltive languages. In other words, the result of t~e translation of the set of derivation trees of a context-free grammar by a TDG is at most a deterministic contextsensitive language. / 82 W.
