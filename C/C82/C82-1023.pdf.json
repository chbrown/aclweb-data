We have investigated this phenomenon in a formal or computational framework which consists of two gramnatical systems and a mechanism for switching between the two systems. A variety of constraints apparent in these sentences are then explained in terms of constraints on the switching mechanism, especially, those on closed class items. I. INTRODUCTION Speakers of certain bilingual cc~nunities systematically produce utterances in which they switch from one language to another (called code-switching), possibly several times, in the course of an utterance. Production and comprehension of utterances with intr~sentential code-switching is part of the linguistic eompetenoe of the speakers and hearers of these cc~nunities. Much of the work on code-switching is in the sociolinguistic framework and also at the discourse level. Recently ther~ have been few studies of code-switching within the scope of a single sentence. (See Sridhar (1980) for a good review, also Pfaff (1979)). Also until recently, this phenomenon has not been studio4 in a formal or computatior~.l framework. (See Sankoff and Poplack (1980), Woolford (1980), Joshi (1980), and boron (1981). Space does not permit a detailed comparison. ) The discourse level of code-switching is important, however, it is only at the intrasentential level that we are able to observe with some certainty, the interaction between two Erammatical systems. These interactions, to the extent they can be systematically characterized, provide a nice framework for investigating some processing issues both fran the generation and parsing points of view. There are some important charscteristios of intrasentential code-switching which give hope for the kind of work described here. These are as follows, i. The situation which we are concerned with involves participants who are about equally fluent in both languages. 2. Participants have fairly consistent judgements about the \"acceptability\" of mixed sentences. (In fact it is amazing that participants have such acceptability judgements at all. ) 3. Mixed utterances are spoken without hesitation, paus. es, repetitions, corrections, etc. , suggesting that intrasentential code-switching is not some random interference of one system with the other. Rather, the switches seem to be due to systematic interactions between the two systems. 4. The two l~age systems seem to be simultaneously active. 5. Intr~sentential code-switching is sharply distinguished from other interferences such as borrowing, learned use of foreign words, filling lexical gaps,.etc, all of which could be exhibited by monolingual speakers. 6. Despite extensive intrasentential switching, speakers and hear~re usually agree on which language the mixed sentence is \"ocraing from\". We call this language the matrix 145 146 A~.

The main result of this paper is that a large ntm%ber of constraints can be derived from a general constraint on the switchability of the so-called closed class items (determinizers, quantifiers, prepositions, tense morphemes, auxilliaries ~ helping verbs, complementizers, pronouns, etc. ). This result is of interest because the differential behavior of closed class items (as compared to the open class items) has been noted in various aspects of language processing (in the monolingual case), for example, (i) certain types of speech errors which strand the closed class items, (2) resistance to change as well as resistance to incGrporate new items as closed class items, (3) frequency indpendent lexieal decision for closed class items (as compared to open class items for which lexical decision is frequency dependent), (4) the absence of frequency independence for closed class items in certain types of aphasia, (5) closed class items aiding in ccm~prehension strategies, etc. (This list is based on a talk given by Mary-Louise Kean at the University of Pennsylvania). It is not clear what the relationship is between the behavior of closed classes in intrasentential code-switching and the other behaviors (in monolingual situations) described above. We believe r however~ that investigating this relationship may give some clues concerning the organization of the granmar and the lexicon, and the nature of the inter~ace between the two language systems. The examples in our paper are all from the language pair, Marathi (m) and English (e), Marathi (m) is the matrix language and English (e) is the embedded language. (The coincidence of the abbreviation m for the matrix language, which is Marathi and e for the embedded language, whieJ~ is English, is accidental, but a happy one:~-. A few facts about Marathi will be useful to note. It is an Indo-European language (spoken on the west coast of India near Bombay and in parts of central India by about 60 million people). It is an S0V language. Adjectives and relative clauses appear prencmirally and it has postpositions instead of pre~ positions. It uses a rich supply of auxilliary or helping verbs. Other facts about Mamathi will become apparent in the examples. (See Section 3). 2. FORMULATION OF THE SYSTI~ Let L m be the matrix language and L e be the embedded language. Further let G m and Ge be the corresponding grammars, i.e., Gm is the matrix ~rmmnaF and Ge.is the embedded ~. A \"mixed\" sentence is a sentence which contaLns lexlcal items from both L m and I e. Let L x be the set of all mixed sentences that are judged to be acceptable. Note that a mixed sentence is not a sentence of either L m or L e. However, it is judged to be \"ccming f-rcm\" im. The task is to formulate a system characterizing L x. Our approach is. to formulate a system for Lx in terms of Gm and Ge and a 'control structure' which permits shifting control from Gm to Ge but not from G e to G m. We assume a 'correspondence' between categories of Gm and Ge, for example, NP m corresponds to NP e (written as NPm~NPe). Control is shifted by a switching r~le of the form (2.1) A m x A e, where Am is a category of Gin, Ae is a category of Ge, and"]},{"title":"Am =Ae.","paragraphs":["At any stage of the derivation, (2.1) can be invoked, permitting A m to be switched to Ae.

The switching rule in (2. i) is as>mrnetric i.e., switching a category of the matrix grammar to a category of the embedded gr~ummr INTRA-SENTENTIAL CODE-MIXING 147 is permitted but not vice versa. This asynmetry can be stated directly in the rule itself, as we have done, or it can be stated as a constraint on a more generalized switching rule which Qill permit switching from Amto A e as well as the other way rotund. We have chosen to state the asyrgretry by incorporating it in the rule itself because the asyn~netry plays such a central role in our formulation. This asygmetric switching rule together with the further constraints described in Section 3 is intended to capture the overpowering judgement of speakers about a mixed sentence \"coming from\" the matrix language Lm. The switching rule in (2.1) is neither a rule of GmnOr a rule of G e. It is also not a rule of a grammar, say G x for Lx. As we have said before, we will construct a system for L x in terms Of Gmand G e and a switchingrule and not in terms of a third ~, say G x. Although formally this can be done, there are important reasons for not doing so. Using this general framework we will now show that the system for L x can be formulated by specifying a set of constraints on the switching rule (beside~ the asyn~netry constraint). These further constraints primarily pertain to the closed class items. 3. CONSTRAINTS ON THE SWITCHING RULE Our hypothesis is that Lx can be completely characterized in terms of constraints on the switching rule (2.1). The types of constraints can be characterized as follows; 3.1 Asyn~netry: We have already discussed this constraint. In fact~we have incorporated~t in the definition of the switching rule itself. The main justifications for as!m~etry are as follows. (a) We want to maintain the notion of matrix and embedded languageS and the asyrmnetry associated with this distinction. (b) Arbitrarily long derivations would be possible, for example, by allowin~ back and forth switching ofAmandAe along a nonbranchingpath. Them appears to be no motivation for allowing such derivations. (c) The asymmtry constraint together with certain constraints on the non-switchability of closed class items seem to allow a fairly cGmplete characterization of L x. 3.2 Constraint on switchability of certain categories: Rule (2.1) permits switching any category Am toA e if Am~Ae. However Certain categories cannot be switched. Although all major categorles can be switched, we must exclude the root node S m. Obviously, if we permit Sm to be switched to Se, we can derive a sentence in Le starting with S m in a trivial manner. Hence, we need the following constraint. (3.2.1) Root node Sm cannot be switched. Constraints on closed class items: (3.2.2) Certain closed class itemS such as tense, ihx, and helping verbs when they appea~in\"main VP cannot be sWitc/%eo. Examples: (underlined items in the examples are from Lm).","(3.1) mula khurcy~ rangawtat. boys ~ paint"]},{"title":"(3.2) mula khurcya paint kartat.","paragraphs":["~nse) In (3.2)the root verb has been switched fr~n Marathi to English.

This phenomenon'appears in mixed sentences-~other language pairs (see Pfaff(1979).) It is not possible to switch both the V and the tense in (3.1), and also not the entire VP. 148 A.K.

Note that (3.4) could be derived by starting with S e (i.e., by starting to derive a sentence of le) and then switching VP e to VPm, but this is not permitted by the asyT~netry constraint. Of course, one cannot start with the S e node because this requires switching S m toS e which is blocked by the constraint on the switchability of the root node. (3.2.3) Closed class items (e.g., determiners, quantifiers, prepositions_, possessiye, aux, tense, helping verbs, etc. ) cannot be switched. Thus, for example, DET m cannot be \"swm~ched to DET e. This does ~ that a lexical item belong-ing to DET e cannot appear in the mixed sentence. It can indeed appear if NP m has already been switched to NP e and then NP e is expanded into DETeN e according to Ge.

However, often we have a choice of a oomplementizer. This choice depends both on the matrix verb V m and the embedded verb V e (V m ~ V e) to which V m has been switched. let the complementizerslof ym h~l C0MPm : [ CI,IC2, C3}land the complementizers of V e (~Vm) be COMPe= {CI, C 2, C 4} where CI~CI, C2~ C 2. Now if V m is switched to V e i.e., the verb is lexically r~alized in the embedded language, then the choice of the oomplementizer is constrained in the following manner. Since complementizers are closed classes, they cannot be switched. Hence, the choice is CI, C 2 , or C3; hQwever 9nly C1 and C 2 are permitted, as the equivalent lexical verb V e permits C i and C~ which are the eqgivalents of C] and C 2 respectively. C$ is not permltted because its equlvalent C 3 ms not pertainS-ted for Ve, and C 4 whlch s the equivalent of C1⁄4 is not permitted because it is not allowed by V m. Thus the only oomplementizers that are permitted, if V m is switched to V e , are those that are permitted by V m and the equivalents of which are permitted by V e (Vm.~Ve). Thus the choice is constrained not only to the complementizers of V m (because of non switchability of complementizers) but it is further constrained by the choice of complementizers of V e as explained above. +This is a problematic case which is discussed in detail in the longer version of this paper.

There are several interesting issues concerning the generation and recognition of sentences such as (3.24) and (3.25). For example, at what point the decision to switch the main verb is made? (We could have raised this issue earlier when we discussed (3.1) and (3.2)). Since a new helping verb has to be introduced when the switch is made, does it mean that sc~e 'local' structural change has to be made along with the switching of the verb? Another point is that the choice of the ccmplementizer (which canes before the matrix verb) also determines whether the verb can be switched or not. The machinery we have provided so far may have to be augmented to provide systematic answers to these questions. Thus for example, we may have to introduce additional constraints on the switching rules. 4. PARSING CONSIDERATIONS In this paper, we have given an account of the constr~ts on intrasentential code-switching in a generative framework. The formal model and the constraints on switching that we have proposed clearly have implications for the kind of par~er we may be able to construct. We will not pursue this aspect in this paper. However, we would like to point out that by adopting some parsing strategies, we can account for scme of the constraints described earlier. A pre liminary attempt was made in Joshi (1981) by proposing a strategy involving a so-called left corner constraint. This stretegy has some serious drawbacks as was pointed out by Doron (1981). She has proposed an alternate strategy called 'early deter~nination strategy', according to which the parser tries to determine as early as possible the language of the major constituent it is currently parsing. Thus upon encountering a Marathi (m) determiner i.e., DET m the parser would predict a Marathi NP m. The Marathi N m could be then realized lexically in Marathi or the Nm would be switched to N e and then lexically realized in English. NP m is expanded into DETmNomm where Nora m is expanded into AmN m. Note that A m and N m could be independently switched to A e and N e respectively, thus giving four possible sequences:","DET m Am Nm, DET m A m Ne, DET m A e Nm, DET m A e Ne, all of which are permissible. If the parser encountered an English determiner, i.e. DET e then it would predict NPe, but now N e or AeN e into whichNPe can expand carrot be switched to N m or Am 150 A.K. JOSH| because of the asymmetry constraint. Thus the only permissible sequence is DET e (A e) Ne, and the following are excluded, i.e., *DET e Nm, * DET e A e Nm~ * DET e Am Ne, * DET e A m Nm, which checks with the data. Of course, so far we have the same predictions as we had with the constraint on the nonswitchability of closed class items. However, there is some evidence to the effect that a parsing strategy as described above may be in effect. The following distribution is correctly predicted by the above strategy: (8.i) * tall pe~ya (5.2) tall boxes (5.3) unea pe~ya (5.4) unca boxes. (5.1) is disallowed, because upon encountering an English adjective, Ae, the parser predicts Nome, which is expanded into A e Ne. However, N e cannot be realized lexically in Marathi, unless N e is switched to Nm, which is disallowed. Note that (S.l) cannot be disallowed by invoking nonswitchability of adjectives, because these are not closed classes. This early determination strategy does not help however in accounting for the distribution of phrases involving postpositions (see Section 3 ). Our conclusion at present is that the framework described in Section 3 along with the constraints on closed class ite~as is the proper way to formulate the code-switching system. A parsing strategy as diseussed above is perhaps also operative (see Examples (5.1) - (5.4)) and when a closed class item is the leftmost constituent of a major category then the two formulations made the same predictions. 5. CONCLUSION We have presented a formal model for characterizing intra-sentential code-switching. The main features of this model are that i) the model treats the two grammars (languages) asynmetrically, 2) there is no third gran~ar, and 3) the constraints on the switchability of closed class items. We believe that further investigation of code-switching in the proposed framework will be very productive, as it captures some essential aspects of intrasentential code,switching. Another interesting result concerns the role of closed class items. Since several inpor~ tant characteristics of closed class items are well-known in the context of processing of monolingual utterances, we think that further investigation of the role of closed class items in the context of code-switching will give us some insights into the processing of monolingual utterances. Our investigation of intrasentential code-mixing can also be considered as a small contribution towards the larger problem of determining the nature of the interface between the two language systems of a bilingual speaker or hearer.
