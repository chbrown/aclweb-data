In this research, we have believe that a correct meaning of the given sentences is obtained if the relations among noun .phrases, which correspond I to objects in the images, consistent with the relations observed among objects in the images.","The Jfact that this identification : of objects and the interpretation ~:of the given sentences supplements each other simplifies both the detection of objects and disamibiguation of word sense or prepositional groups. In Spite of these effects, this forlalisn has a defect that it requires additional knowledge sources, the model of objects that will appear inpthe images. All of models of objects or actors that are supposed to appear in, the picture must be given to our system in order to achieve its purposes. But it is not easy for us to store all of such models in a computer. If a person who does not know. well about the details of this system wants to interact,with it~ he will give up to use the system, as he knows nothing !of the representation~ of models in the computer. To make matters worse, there, are quite many variations in real objects which we will. encounter in the real world. For example,we can see various type of houses. ~:In the traditional AI system, :a generic model is utilizedJ to identify such class of objects. But it is not easy for such a system to discriminate idiosyncrasy of varous objects, iFig.l shows a part~ of sample story used to experiment its story understanding capability. Even if the system is supposed to be given a generic model (for example, BOGLE) that represents both OBAQ and OJIRO, the system will not be able to discriminate them. The system needs some ,proper model for 0BAQ and OJIRO. But if a new character which has some similar points to;0BAQ and OJIR0 apperes in the story, some modificationsl to the BOGLE model are required., Thus generalization process could not be acomplised in advance, but should be achieved through experiance.","When, we are asked to do some task, we are usually given informations concerning to the objects of that task and ~their processing method. In case where we encounter some~unkown objects ~n the course of the taskL we can construct aJ more generic ,model including them ~together with a,ereation of instance models for those individuals by d~manding an explanation to a person who knows well about those objects. In this~real situation, it cannot be expected that a learning process proceeds successfully like the experiment studied :by Winston, as the assumption fails of success that the samples can be arranged conveniently for the learning. We usually augment our knowledge by explicitly being taught about missing or insufficient parts of the known models.","In order to realize this type of learning, there are two important problems to be solved. First is an explanation capability. Unless a 2 N. ABE and S. TSUJI capability to convey one's obscure points ta his partner:is given to the system, it is difficult for the system to obtain good instructions from its partnerL","Second is a::point that fromiwhat kind of levels of knowledge state the system~:sheuld start its learning process. Should an initial state of~knowledge be given in forms of an inner representation or be explained in natural language? We select the former approach by just the following reason. Ve think it quite difficult to give a clear view to unknown object without referring to models. So we restrict a class of objects learned by our system:to the group of objects of which the system can .obtain clear views concerning to their conditions through the comparison with their similar example.","But the assumption is not required that, examples should be different in only one or two points at most from the unknown object. Many, discrepancies between the object and its models are permitted to exis~ because such differences can be explained explicity in the language, by a teacher. And through a cognition of analogical or discrepant points of objects belonging to the same conceptual class, a generalization process is invoked that creates a common concept to them. ~."]},{"title":"Description for","paragraphs":["Object","The 'model description used in this paper is, the same one shown in the paper[I] except for the usage of the frame representation to describe~ relations among subpartsof the model.

Basic:Strategy of Learning The system tries to generate,a model for the unknown object by referring to an analogical model and using a teacher's instruction, and simultaneously it augments the concept trees~of objects. At that time, the first key for a detection of analogy is assumed to be in locations of subparts of objects.

C: OJiro is a yellow region and hie body has a hair, a mouth, eyes and hands. 5. Example","We would llke to explain how the dialog shown in 5. has been obtained. By (I~ the program generate OIJRO model from OBAQ model shown in Fig.3:~ and constructs a frame tree consisting from a BOGLE frame and the OBAQ frame, is stored as an instance of the BOGLE frame. But it records~in its STM thatlthere is just one hair as the teacher said so. Next, C~looks for a candidate region of OJIRO using the copied model. In.the second frame, OBAQ, TABLE, APPLE, CLOCK and OJIRO are drawn, but as the first four,objects have been appeared in the first frame, in this case C can find OJIRO by looking for new objects. But regrettably a color of the region (yellow) which seems to be OJ-IRO'S. body(J-BODY) being different from that of the model(white), this cause a complaint shown in (2) and by accepting a T's agreement C can believe its correctness and T can also think C in a right state. Consequently, C changes value of C0L in J-BODY into YELLOW.","Next~ C tries a verificationiof J-HAIR which is the ~first member of Scots'r; where Scou'r={J-HAIR,J-HAND}","As C can be aware of the fact that J-HAIR is a hair by its AK0 slot and that there is a note on the hair in STM, it can know that 0JIR0'S ~hair cannot be recognized only by referring~to the copied model. Since the just one alteration in the number of hairs is recordedf there,, C thinks their location to be same as tl~ model specification, end can find a line in the ((C)U) part of J-B0bY. It ends the ve~ffication of J-HAIR by storing (H1 NIL). into SUBB ~lor io place of:(L1 NIL L2 NIL L3 NIL). In a similar ~ay to this, C begins to A LEARNING OF OBJECT STRUCTURES BY VERBALISM identify J-HAND, however C can be aware of that it should 10ok for J-R-HAND and J-L-HAND, as ~here is a CONCEPT slot in J-HAND. So C succeeds in the identification*of them~because.of a perfect match in their locations, colors and substructureS.","The result of this steps is reported in (3). Next,. the identification process proceeds to Sin and C starts a verification of J-MOUTH,~where SIxffi(J-MOUTH, J-EYE). As the locational constraint for this part is ((**)C), which means that it occupies ((L)C), ((C),C) and ((R),C) of J-BODY, the check is attempted whether just one candidate can be found for each of.these 3 subregions. In this case, nothing is found for ((L)C)land ((R)C) but several parts are found in ((C)C) of J-BODY. So this process is suspende d and identification of other parts (J~R-EYE and J-L-EYE) is attempted, but the same ambiguity as the above occurs and this causes the identification steps to be suspended. Consequently, for each one of these 3 parts,,their results are just same ~each other; there are 3~parts in the ((C)C)of J-BODY and theylare candiades for J-MOUTH, J-R-EYE and J-L-EYE. Then C avails of the relational constraint onilocations of them in order to clarify their correspondences as far as .possible. It infers, that J-MOUTH ,probably locates in a lower position than J-EYE, because the location*of J-MOUTH is ((**)C) and that of J-R-EYE and J-L-EYE is ((L)U) and ((R)Ut respectively (in this example note that the location of J-EYE, ((**)U) can be also available)~ And it is also.decidable if which black region corresponds to J-L(R)-EYE using, the relation between ((L)U) and ((R)Ut. By this assumption on availabilty of the relational constraints, C can discover one possible correspondence between the model and object. Then other properties are tested: But regrettably, discrepancies are found for both his mouth and eyes. The candidate for his mouth is a line segment, whereas the model says that it is a region and that it has a substructure. Similary the candidate for his left(right) eye is a black region,but its model description is that it is a white region with. a substructure.. At the present.state of program, any estimation on which is more plausible is.not realized regarding to the accordance of these properties, C simply complains about their disagreements in the order of their discovery.","Therefore it at first complains of his mouth as shown in (4). Given teacher*s instruction on a. shape of mouth, C is convinced of his decision and add a new slot SUBB in plac e of SUBP and records (H~ NIL) into it becase it has found that his mouth is not a region but a line segment. Here instead of the instructionJ(9), T can say that C should be believe the given image correct. In that case, C suppose its decision to be right and does the same thing as the above. The difference between these two cases is that the latter has a high risk in the correctness of its conclusion.","Next, C complains about the discrepancies of his eyes. Note here that nothing is stated, about his left-eye oncean instruction on his right-eye is given to it, because they have the same properties concerning to both their models and object parts. In case where one of them is not same, a question is asked:about the difference by:C. T. Use of Generic Frames","As mentioned in 4., OBAQ frame causes BOGLE frame to~be generated as a generic ene, and OJIRO frame ~is obtained through learning process. At present our program ~ust makes frame, trees in which OJIRO and OBAQ frame are child of BOGLE.","A reason for this~is partly due to a lack of condsideration how simple pictorialidescriptions can be compiled from various types of deviations in slot values. An another reason is that there is a danger of partial rearrangements of frames trees~ In the example, we at first believe OBAQiframe to be an instance, frame but it may turn out thatiit is not an instance when other examples not mat.ched to this frame appears in:image, because there are many varietions in his shape as he can wink or move his eyes or open his mouth. After program have N. ABE and S. TSUJI experinced these example, it should ~:,~ke a general concept of OBAQ and arrange frame trees by erasing unnecessary instances about him.","As amore important problem, s.rategies to discover cues for finding analogy between subparts mus. belstored in some slots of their model; that is, the locational con~ aint is a useful cue for human, animals and so on, but is not adeq, i for doors and windors of houses.","Though there are some inco~ ,ete points in the construction of frame trees, program can use a po, 1on of them to identify subparts of the object to be learned. For e~ample, suppose that we,would like to teach a character Q-KO by referrin~ to OJIBO. Let suppose that Q-RO resembles to him very much except for her eyes but that they are rather similar to OBAQ's. In the course of identification of her, if OBAQ frame is not stored, program will complain about her eyes as well as in the learning of OJIRO from OBAQ. However it can use OBAQ'S eyes in the 1recognition of her eyes by tracing its AKO link and finding OBAQ frame, after a failure in the matching of her eyes to OJlRO's. Of cause, it does not do that without teacher's permission~ hut will ask for his approvals; 8. Explanation Capability \"","It is necessary for teacher to be given sufficient explanations about the level of knowledge the computer has attained. Unless the computer~can tell him what it is~looking for, what it has already found, what sort of descrepancies it suffers from, he cannot give"]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["roper instructions leading the ~computer to a satisfastory state. here are many sentence generating and explanation systems, however an explanation system like this research has not been investigated in the point that our system tries to give its partner an explanation or pictorial features of objects to:be modeled by translating sentences not from the case frame, of sentences but from frames corresponding to the pictorial models. Naturallysuch an explanation is on locations, shapes, :colors and relations that models or objects have, and must be given in, the forms that the partner can easily understand what the system knows. 'For this purpose, the explanation on locations is first attempted using the referred things in the dialog, and is finally given in an absolude coordinate based on the 9 subregions if there is no reference or the reference stack becomes empty. (4),(5),(6) in the Scenario~ shows <this mechanism. The next important thing is that a partner may expect a detail explanation for something, but expect just a simple one for others. Regrettably the present sate of our program cannot detect his demand like this or resolve ambiguous points of his questionl then it must ask him about his require as shown in (7). In this case, thereiare also many things to be explained, however the points are only stated by the program and the detail explanation is left to the partner as in (8). We believe this method proper because of easiness of explanations.","The comparison between things are listed in above of (9) in order to clarify their~differencies. If more detail on the lip is needed, the partner can ask the system about itL On account of limited space, though we cannot state a sufficient :discussion, there are many problems to he improved on how the system should grasp partner's intention or requirments. They must be solved for giving simple explanation to the partner.
