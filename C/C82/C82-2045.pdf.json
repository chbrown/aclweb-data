Nirenburg Department of Computer Science The Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel","I. Amon~ the various traditions established in computer processing of natural language during the twenty-odd years of research the understanding thet any such processing is to be done sequentially has a special status.","Even the most advanced natural language processing systems employ the sequential mode as a necessary evil, or do not even consider it an evil due to the ostensible lack of alternatives; thus, for instance, such well-known systems as SAM, PAM, ELI /cf. e.g. Schank and Riesbeck, 1981/, PHRAN /cf. e.g. Arens, 1981/ or PARSIFAL /see e.g. Marcus, 1979/ are all based on sequentionslity.","The recent advances in the VLSI technology suggest %her a re-evaluation of this tradition is in order. Indeed, non-sequential \"parallel ~ methods start emerging. In the field of AI one could mention, for example, Kornfeld's (1979, 1981) work in problem solving or the approach of HEARSAY-II (see Erman et el., 1980) to speech processing. The word parallelism seems even to turn gradually into a current \"buzz-word\" in the AI community. Note that the meaning of this word still remains largely loose. Thus, Phillips and Hendler (1981) snggest a system of several tss___~k-oriented - 186 - processors working in parallel.","2. A different and a more powerful approach to parallel processing of natural language is suggested here: in'steed of functional distribution we suggest parallel distribution of input stream elements; a processor is assigned to avery item of input and each such processor is provided with the same software package, so that all processes within a certain group become equal in status and modus operandi. (Note that this also increases the system's reliability, since even in the unlikely case of failure of n-1 processes the remaining one will accomplish the task by itself, in the sequential mod • o~","Our approach to parallelism is based on the phenomenon of locality. Currently we apply it to constructing a syntactic parsing system for s subset of English, as e simple case of natural language processing.","3. Let us consider a text as a vector made up of discrete elements wi:","T = /w0, wl, ..., Wn/. Being fed with T a certain Natural Laugue~e Processor (NLP) produces a structure of the form S(T) = /v0, Vl, ...,"]},{"title":"Vm/,","paragraphs":["where vj can be of various nature: words in the object language and/or word~ and symbols in a metalangua~e and/or various kinds of delimiters.","Let D(Vj) be the minimal subset of T determining v~ in the sense that information carried in the elements of th~s subset is necessary end sufficient for outputting vj by the NLP. Let gj be the index of the leftmost element of D(v.) in the string T, and Hi, the index of the rightmost one (e.°g. if D(v~) = /w3, ws, w10/ then g~ = 3 and hj = 10). We now define the important notion of locality.

If an output element v~ depends on exactly one element wi, then its locality is unity, the highest possible value. On the other hand, if a certain v k depends on • large range of input elements, then its locality is close to zero. Comparir~ parallel and sequential prooessinE we show that the ratio of the time necessary to produce an output element in parallel mode to that of the sequential mode strictly depends on the locality of this element. Moreover, the relative time gain of parallel processin8 as regards sequential processing is exactly the given element's locality. In other words, the greater the ~egate locality of elements in a certain text, the more benefit there is in its parallel processing. Such is the in-trinsic connection between the notion of locality and the performance of a system based on parallel processing.","4. The process of implementation starts with finding clusters of h~h locality in the text.At this st~e we prove the following .Proposition. NPs, .VPs and PPs of English are highly local. On this basis we proceed to build a system of parallel parsir~ for ~liah. In its present form the system consists of three modules: a morphological and two syntactic ones. The result of the first stage is a set of sets of distionary entries for every input word, which determines the syntactic classes to which the input words may in principle belong. A ~.ammar for each processor et the first syntactic stage of analysis is presented as a table which indicates all the correct triads of syntactic class members in the subset of Er~lish We are analyzing. This means that this stnge is devoted to finding the states of compatibility between the \"neighbouts\" in the input string. It terminates when all the possible triads have been checked, produces candidates for correct parses (if any) and transfers them to the second syntactic stage whose task is a/ to carry out all kinds of agreement - 188 - and completeness tests (e.g. the subject-predicate number agreement and the presence of at least one verb in the sentence, reap.) and b/ to build one or more representations of the parse(s) (e.g. a constituent tree and a predicate-role structure). This modular framework facilitates the addition of new stages to the system, such as one or more semantic stages and an inferencir~ mechanism (provided a world is defined) •","The coBunication between separate stages of analysis is accomplished globally, and here a secondary parallelism, this time the functional one (of. Phillips and Hendler, op. cit.)-can be implemented. References.","A~ens, Y. (1981). Using language and context in the analysis of texts. Proceedings of the IJCAT-81. Vancouver,B.C.","Er~an, L. et el.
