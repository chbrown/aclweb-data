The work was done within the framework of EUROTRA and sponsored by the Commission of the European Community. Work on this paper was begun whilst the author was at ISSCO, Genev a.","Throughout this paper we shall imagine a machine translation system which performs the following: correct analysis of source language, correct structure of target language sentence, correct choice of words in the target language. In this enviro~.ent we shall discuss some aspects of the problem of constructing the correct finite verbal form. The languages involved are the languages of the European Community. It is obvious that it is not possible simply to use the \"same\" morphological form in the target language as in the source language: verbal tenses are not the same in all languages (not even in languages as closely related as those considered) and even where the same tenses exist they do not necessarily have the same distribution. So a mapping has to be defined.","AS EUROTRA is in its conception multilingual this mapping should not be defined on a binary basis (between pairs of languages), but should rather consist in a definition of some basic and global interpretations of the morphology of verbs in the languages considered. - 190 -","The study can.not be restricted to morphology proper. Meanings that are expressed morphologically (by auxiliaries or flexives) in one language might be expressed lexically (by the use of particular lexical units) in other languages. As an example~ take the progressive aspect in English: En. they are ~it_~_i~_n~ -~ Fr. ils 4crivent / ils @ont en train d'4crire, --~ --~ Danish de skTiver / de sidder cg skriver / de er i f~rd wed at ~krlve.l.e. the progressive aspect which is expressed in English by morphological mesns, is in French and Danish either not expressed or expressed by certain lexical units.","It is very important to realize the impact of this, There is often a tendency to think that in the analysis of language a borderline can be drawn between morphological information and lexioal information. This is true to s large extent when only one language is considered, but it is certainly not true in a multilingual environment. Roughly speaking, the system should take into account all pieces of information which can be expressed morphologically in at least one language. The propose~ e.yetem for the representation of verbal forms.","The system as such will contain the global information, i.e. the information which has to be transferred to other languages. In this paper only the transfer of active finite verb forms with respect to tense will be considered, i.e. modality, voice, etc. is not taken into account.","Apart from this global information the system can for each language be expanded with all kinds of local information which is useful for analysis or for generation. Some morphological phenomena are only grammatically bound and do not carry any semantic meaning that should be coded for the use of other languages, e.g. the use of the subjonctif in French subordinate clauses following ll faut que. Information about this subjonctif can be regarded as internal to French and should not be expressed in the global system.","The variables proposed to describe the semantic content of tense and aspect are the following (Note that tens_...._ee is - 191 - used in a very general meaning. Tense is determined by values of time and aspect. It should also be noted that the use of the concepts aspect and Aktionsart has been de£indd with respect to the languages involved and consequently is not necessarily the traditional one): TENSE ::s (AXIS, PROSPECTIVE, RETROSPECTIVE, ASPECT,","AKTIONSART ) AXIS :'- l~C [ TU~C PROSPECTIVE z -- PROSPECT- I PROSPECT+ RETROSPECTIVE : := RE~RO- I RETRO+ ~ CONTINUOUS I \"\"\" ASPECT : :. nul._.~l ~ EMPHATIC PROGRESSIVE AKTIONSART ::= DURATIVE ~ NON-DURATIVE Suggestions of other values (for English, for the examples","below) : AKTIONSART ::= DYNAMIC ~ STATIVE or perhaps rather","ACTIVITY VERB ~ PROCESS VERB I TRANSITIONAL","EVENT VERB For adverbs a value TIMEWI~lq.","In the paper the use of the variables and their values will be explained. Here only a few remarks can be made.","1. The system is viewed as operating in all languages on two time axes, one for the tenses that are anchored in the present, and a parallel one for the tenses that are anchored in the past (NUNC and TUNC, respectively),","2. The RETROSPECTIVE value CONTINUOUS is used for events that are still going on: F~. il demeure la depui~ un mois end En. He has l~.ved there fo r\" a month will get the same values: (I~NC, PROSPECT-, CONTINUOUS, null, DURATIVE).","3. More values for the RETROSPECTIVE variable is to be foreseen.","4. In English it is not possible to have the prefect tense with an adverbial of the type TIMEWHEN. So a rule of the generation ~smmar of English will say that (~UNC, PROSPECT-, RETRO+ ..,..) + TI~WHEH -~ (TUNC, PROSPECT-, RETRO-,..,..)","5. Certain verbs in English tend to prefer the progressive - 192 - aspect. Consequently the AKTIONSART must be expanded as to be able to express these facts:","A simulation of the system made on some Community texts shows"]},{"title":"good","paragraphs":["results.","A text is shown in the appednix An French (source) and in English.
