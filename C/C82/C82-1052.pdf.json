Institut A Joachim H.Laubsch Institut f. Informatik","Universitaet Stuttgart D-7ooo Stuttgart","West Germany The paper discusses the role of argumentation schemata and their interaction with other knowledge sources within a computer model for in-depth understanding of newspaper texts about jobmarket developments. Some of these schemata are presented; the \"ALTHOUGH ...\"-argumentation (German: \"TROTZ ...\") and its formalization are discussed in detail. 1. Introduction Reading newspapers may be seen as an \"everyday cognitive task\". Therefore it is not astonishing that some work in Artificial Intelligence aims at the simulation of aspects of the understanding processes of newspaper readers [Eisenstadt 1977; Rosenberg 1977]. There have even been pioneering system~: the Script ~0plier Mechanism [Cullingford 1978] demonstrated careful reading of \"event~--oriented news stories about earthquakes, vehicle accidents, plane crashes and so on, whereas FRUMP [DeJong 1979] si~Jlated skimming abilities using texts about the same themes. We are working with texts about jobmarket developments taken from West German newspapers [Laubsch&Roesner 1980]. An important aspect of our texts is that they deal with argtm~ntations about reported data and their respective changes. In this paper we describe our (not yet implemented) conceptual approach for processing such structures. 2. Understanding ar~nentstion In our view, argtm~ntation schemata in general work on a kind of \"theory\" of the domain of discourse, i.e. on a structure that encodes knowledge about domain-specific dependencies. We use a dependency-network in order to represent the average reader's expertise and qualitative reasonin@ ability about the jobmarket. Our representation is influenced by ideas from [Sussman&Steele 1980]. In some sense, one may interpret an argtm~ntation schema as a function that takes propositions (<PROP>s) as arguments. In case of coherent or correct use, these propositions have to fulfill certain constraints that are defined with reference _ to the \"theory\" of the specific domain of discourse. Thus, wundersta~ir~\" ~tati(m~ in terms of these schemata can be seen as establishing the constraint relations between given propositions by an inference mechanism that operates on the dependency net of the domain. This always involves testing on discourse coherence (if it is assumed to have a correct \"theory\") and/or checking the \"theory\" (if it is assumed to have correct texts). 325 326 D.F. ROESNER and J.H. LAUBSCH 3. Explanation schemata Explanation schemata deal with reasons - in cur domain these are mostly reasons for the jobmarket fluctuations under discussion. Although we use German surface-oriented labels (which we transcribe into ~glish), we are discussing all of the following examples as deep structures that may be underlying to diverse surface constructs. ~i> <PR~a-2>': (~-OF <PROP-l> <PROP-2>) This is a general explanation schema. If used correctly, then <PRUP-I> gives reason(s) for <PROP-2> : If <PROP-l> is a \"simple\" fact in our theory, then there must be an inference path in the dependency net along cause-effect links leading from <PROP-l> to <PROP-2>. If <PROP-I> is a conjunction of two (or more) \"simple\" facts, then inference paths starting from those points must interfere in such a way that they finally lead to <PRDP-2>. Among German surface triggers for the BECAUSE-OF-schema are: \"WEGEN ...\", \"WL \" ...\", \"DA ...\", \"DURCH ...\", \"AUFCAqD%D %~N ...\", \"INFDLGE DES ...\", but also more elaborate ones like \" ... DARAUF ~EN DASS ...\" or \"... DAMIT ~EN DASS \" <PROP>': (MOREOVER <PROP>) This schema may be used if we are discussing a complex situation where consequences of several factors interfere and where the already mentioned (or derived) propositions are not sufficient to explain a given result. <PROP> must satisfy the constraint that it gives additional supportive reason for an unexplained effect, i.e. <PROP> opens a new inference-path in the dependency net such that interference with previous i~lete paths is possible in a way which finally produces the explanation that is searched for. <PR~*-I> <PR~*-2>': (ALTH0[K~ <PROP-l> <PROP-2>) This sch~na deals with expectations and their non-fulfillment. Other surface manifestations are constructs like \"O~90HL <PROP-l> <PROP-2>\", \"UNGEACHTET <PROP-i> <PR0P-2>\" or \"ZWAR <PROP-l> D~k%X3CR <PROP-2>\". The relation between <PROP-l> and <PROP-2> in an ALTB0t~H-schema involves a third proposition <PROP-2'>, whose constraints are:","a) <PROP-2'> is in a contradictive relation (e.g. negation) to <PROP-2>","b) <PROP-2'> could be expected as a (default) conm ~uence of <PROP-l> (or in other words: (BECAUSE-OF <PROP-l> <PROP-2'>) could be verified). In coherent texts the contradiction between expected and actual development given with an ALTH0t~R-schema will demand further explanation. ~0~@exsta~ing\" ~lamat/cm thus involves answering the following questions: AI: ~lat was the unfulfilled expectation <PROP-2'> contrary to <PROP-2>? I%2: Why did the expectstion~s) <PROP-2'> fail? A3: ~at caused the fact(s) of <PROP-2> to happen? Until we cannot sufficiently re=.x)Ive these explanation tasks, the ALTH0t~B-sche~a will keep active and guide the processing of further input. 4. A detailed example In order to clarify our _approach, let us trace the processing of the flow of argumentation in an actual newspaper article (taken from \"Stbttgarter Nachrichten\", March 7, 1979). ARGUMENTATION STRUCTURES IN NEWSPAPER TEXTS 327 S~_= TRDTZ DES ANHALT~-NDEN ~ IST IN DER BUNDESREPUBLI K DIE AK~EITSLOS~ZAHL IM FEBRUAR LEICHT Z~KG~GANGEN. (Englo : In spite of continuing winter weather the numbe~ of une~@loyed in the FRG decreased slightly in february. ) Input to the inference machine is vmitten in a surface-oriented frame notation (~-~hich could e.g. be produced by a semantic ATN-grammar). The representation of S1 is: (ALTHOUSH-1 PI~OP-I: (WEATHER TYP~ ~!Ik~I~R","MOD: *"]},{"title":"(AIL~IALT~k~)) ~)","paragraphs":["PIK)P-2\" (CHANGE-I QUANTITY: (NR-UN~LOYED","AREA: BRD) TIME: * (IM FEBRHAR) VALUE: (DECREASE","MOD: ~ (LEICHT) ~) ) ) (Slot-fillers with ,,en have been taken literally from the given sentence and are processed by \"specialists\"~ e°g~ IH FEBRUAR is interpreted - aocording to a default text convention - as publication year's february.) The first step in processing AL~THOL~JH-I is to construct PROP-2' as a negation of PROP-2. In this case, the \"subject\" of PIRDP-2 is \"CHANGE-I NR-~ (IN ~ FIRG IN FEBRUARY ..)\", whereas the \"predicate\" is the filler of the VALUE-slot, i°eo SLIGHT-DECREASE. The procedure for generating a candidate PROP-2' preserves the \"subject\", but negates the \"predicate\". What is the negation of a SLIGHT-DBCREASE? For pur~s of qualitative reasoning, we take VALUEs for CHANGEs frcm a five point scale from \"++\" (~-INCRFASE) to \"~\" (~-DECRFASE), i.e. \"-~ corresponds to SLIGHT-DECREASE. Interpreting negation of SLIGHT-DECREASE as simply taking the complement of {-} with respect to t/~e set of all VALUES = {++, +, 0, -, --} would yield I~-DECREASE L%ICHANGI~) SLIO}Ff-~ ~-INCREASE], but a constraint for surface constructs allows us to exclu61e IARGE-DECI%EASE in this case. If a larger value had been expected (and not the opposite direction of change), then this would have been indicated by a modifier like \"NUR\" (EngI.\"ONLY\") as in: TIIOTZ DER SAI~E IM OK\"rOBER STIES DIE ARBEIT~LOSEN~ IN DEM MZX~IAT NUR IIM 0oi AUF 3.3 PROZENT AN (from \"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\", Nov. 7, 1979).
