INTRODUCTION The early 70S have brouF~at the Intelligent CAI /ICAI/ systems [3~4~o In these systems all course material is represented independently of teachin~ procedures. The goal of ICAI research is to obtain an individualization of inst1~aotion by providin~ an ability of answerln~ studentts questions as well as genel~atin~ remedial oomments~problems and advioes~ aeco1~Lin~ly to current studentPs respormos and his abilities and preferences in general. ICAI researchers have firstly focused their investigations on representation of the subject matter. Mostly semantic nets have been used as representation of static [~J and procedural [~p~] domain knowled-Ge. Database of an instz~ctlo~Ll system includes also a representation of currlculumto or~nlze an instz~uotlon of new knowledge [~pY~ It is helpful in seleotln~ material to be presented to the student. Th£s paper presents the knowledge representation method based on predicate calculus in an intelligent C AT system~ which is applied to teach the programmi~ language [J]o The prototype of the presented approach w~s an application of predloate calculus to describe pro~- ramsp written in ALGOL~ to l~ove their oozTe©tness~ introduced by ~stall [2]. The ~aowledge about syntu and semantlos of\" the progrmmni~ lan6~a~e has been represented in the form of a set of first oz~er logic axloms~ Them are given some notes how to construct the predicate calculus lan~age and axioms desor~bin~ the subject matter. The directed graph of concepts as a method to represent an instx~ctiona~ structure of tile domain knowledge has been introduced aXong with the runner of ~enemtin~ instructional te~ts to the student° Then the procedure answeri~ studGnt~s queat~ons has been desoribedo 13 14 B. BEGIER PREDICATE CALCULUS APPLIED TO REPRESENT EN01~EDGE ABOUT THE PRO-GRAMMING LANGUAGE The followin~ criteria may be referred to knowledge representation methods for ICAI systems [.1,7]:","- ability to express a large set of concepts of the domain bein~ • taught p","- facility of codln~ these concepts and relations amon~ them~","- easy way to t~ansform the formal notation into the natur~l language formp","- effiolenoy of information retrieval duri~ the process of answerin~ user's query and proving the correctness of his answer~","- ability of automated deduction application in the question - answerln~ process. Let us conside~ a subset of an ALGOL-llke progx~ammin~ lan~uage~containin~ simple arithmetic and logical expressions~ instruction of substitution and conditional and o~ instructions. We assume that each instruction has been written in a separate line of program. The predicate calculus language developed to represent knowledge about the progI~ammlng lan6~age contains:","- names of sets~ called sorts of objects~ representing elements of syntax and semantics of a pro~Tammln~ lan~uagep","- funotions~ transformln~ obJeotsp","- predioates~ representin~ relations between objects. Some sortsj functions and predicates are introduced to represent syntax of the prog~ammlng lan~uage.0thers represent its semantics.","N o t a t i o n. The ordinary predicate calculus notation has been","used. Some modifications improve the readability of statements: - unquantified vat-fables are gener~lly qua~t~.~le~. ~ - two-places predicates are written in an infix manner~ - binary arithmetic functions are written in an infix ma~n~rp - parenthesis are used in the ordinary meanin~ - clauses are separated by dots. P r o g r a m s y n t a x. The program syntax has been described by a set of clauses w~itten in the predicate calculus language. Sorts of objects /examples/~ identifier~ number~ expresslon~ arlthmetio expression~ logical expression~ label~ instruction~ program line. Functions transform some expressions_into te~ms~ by example:","dod_~ wax wa-w-wa where: ~a - arithmetic expression~","it: wa~wa---wl wl - logical expression~","pod_~ id x wy~ in id - identifier~","sko; et~ in wy - expression~ et - label~","ifl: wl × wi ----in in - instruction~","~ri - program line. First of these functions constructs an expression~ which represents an operation of addition~ the second one gives as a result an expression representing the \"less than\" relation and the others constr~et appropriately the substitution instr~ction~ the ~ instruction and the conditional instruction. Some p~edlcates have been introduced to represent the syntax relations between syntax obJeots~ like followin~:","wins ~wix in","pet ~ et ~ wi","~s ~ wl x wi First of these predicates indicates the location of an instruction KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION METHOD IN AN ICAI SYSTEM 15 in a given pro~z~m llne r the second one assi~s a label at the be-6~i~ning of a progmam line and the third one determines the direct succession of two progx~um lines in a sequence. Example,. The syntax of a pro~am containing three followin~ substi- ~uti one :","J = L","L= L+ 2","E- K = J + L is described like tb~tz","wl wins pod(J~LJ . w2 bnas wl. w2 wins pod(Lpdod(L, 2~ .","E pet W3o w~ bnas W2o w3 wln____ss pod K~dod(J,L)) . P r o g r a m s e m a n t i c s° Semantics of an al~orithmic language is represented by a set of axioms ~rit%en in the predicate calculus l~age. New sorts of obJects~ functions and predicates are to be intrOduced.

DIRECTED GRAPH AS A D~rHOD OF INSTRUCTIONAL STRUCTURE REPRESENTATION An assumption is done that all knowledge to be tau6ht can be divided to instructional units.Thus the first step to oonstr~ot an instructional structure representation is to select such units /concepts/. Each of them has a name and at least one sentence can be told about it /unreal concepts are not allowed/.Some introductory concepts are assumed to be known to the student.","The next step is to specify all relations between concepts.These re-","lations could be: /a/ Concept X is a part of Y, /b/ Concept X has a property~ represented by Z~ ~ oncept X is a reason Or a Justification of T,","Concept X belongs to the object class represented by K, /e/ Concept X is an alternative of A~ /f/ Concept X is equivalent to W at least in some circumstances. Each relation corresponds with a graph, which nodes represent concepts from an introduced set of concepts.The composition of all obtained 6~aphs rerults in a final graph~whlch represents an instructional structure of the subject matter.Because of the different in-terpretation of the particular arches of this ~Taph /which are described by various relationships/ the \"superior-inferior\" relation is introduced as the universal one which represents every relation between concepts.Thus the dlrested ~phhas been obtained,~ith arrows directed to the superior concepts. A set of axioms is associated with each node of the concept graph. Also some other information may be associated with it. ANSWERING STUDENT'S QUESTIONS","The followin~ problems have to be solved| - choice and specifyin~ of classes of user's queries,which can","be answered by the ICAI system~ - reco@~nition of a main subject of the query,","translation of the query from natural language to the predicate","calculus language formula, - application of the automated theorem-provin~ techniques to re-","trieve an answer, - generatin~ of an answer in natura~ language form.","Three classes of queries have been qonsidered:","/I/ Decision queries of gener~l\\form in natural language","<interrogative particle> < sentence> 7","where: <interrogative partiole>/existin~ in Polish/ deter-","mines that a question belongs to this class 9","~entenoe> - indicative sentence, KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION lVlETHOD IN AN ICAI SYSTEM 17 which require an answer in the form .Y~s, or \"No\".","/2/ Objective quez-lee of ~enez~al foz~ in natuz~l lansuage","Whloh ~senex~l name> <predloate~ ? whloh require to retrieve an object posessi~E some glven features as an answer.

A dofiD/tlon of acceptable language of user's queries involves the form of translation rules from n~tux~tl lan~u.age into the predloate calculus formula. It is worth notloln~ that:","- querles in the natural lar~ua~e £orm have the threefold nature~ it means they can be counted into the three mentioned above olasses~","- queries fragments in the form of indicative clauses are built from expressed in natural language p~edloates~introduee~ in the present ed f or~alization~","- in respect of quantity of expressions the language of user's queries is comparable with the laa1&~e obtained in the process of translation of p~ed/oate calculus axioms into natural lan~ua~e~","- lan@uaGe o~ user's queries and the predloate calculus l~a~e have a common base of basle concepts because the sorts of ob~eots~ functions and pFedicates introduced in the predloate calculus language correspond with some specified natural language expressions. It has been submitted that questlon-answering problem m~y be solved with an application o~ auto~te~ theorem-pyo~,in~ teohnlques~ namely on the base o[ the resolution principle [8] ,This method~ based only on the s~rnteac of olauses~ doesn't require to control the proo~ procedure by the user,The resolution prlnelple requires to convert all formulas into the Skolem conjunctive form. Thus each formula becomes a set of olauses~ each of them bei~E a dlsjunotion of literals, The question-ans~ering procedure for deolslon queries tries to pro- ~e that a negation of formula ~ ob%alned after translation of the quer~ is false, I£ it's so~ an answer is \"Yes\". If a proo~ procedure applied to the formula in its a~firmati~/e ~or~ provides a sucoess~ an answer is \"NO\".Some questions may be unsolvable in the lack of kno~le~e.","The proof procedure £or objective queries examines a £ormula ~~x"]},{"title":"(w (x} ~","paragraphs":["A"]},{"title":"(x))","paragraphs":["18 B. BEGIER which is supposed to be false.The proof prroedure tries to retrieve a counter-example, if i% exists, which will be substituted in the place of X o I% has been assumed that problem queries are in the implication form after the translation proeess. Question-answerin~ procedure for this class of queries has been reduced to such onetwhich tries to retrieve an answer from one axiom. For the first subclass of problem queries a search is made for an axiom in the implication form, ~hich conclusion embodies the conclusion of the formula obtained from the tx~ansformed query. The premises of this axiom are an answer° The proof procedure applied to answer a question of the second subclass tries to find an axiom~ which premises are implied by premises of the formula obtained f~om the transformed query. The conclusion of this axiom is an answer. The proper way to reduce a number of clauses taking a part in the resolution process is to constr,~ct an initial active set of clauses as a set containing only clauses of axioms concerning concepts reco- ~LIzed in the query and clauses of formula obtained from the query. The translation rules,applied to transform axioms from the predicate calculus language into the natural language expressions t can be used also to translate the retrieved answer to the natural language° CONCLUSIONS Described above ~1o~le~e representatiom method based on predicate calculus has been applied to the large subset of FORTRAN 1900 [I] . I% has been sho~n that this method satisfies criteria required in the ICAI system. An application of the predicate calculus language to describe knowledge about the programming language provides the automated answering of student's questions,whlch is the main advantage of this method. T~Lis method is applicable to those domains of ~owledge, which can be represented by the set of first or~er logic axioms, with regard to their formalized nature.","REFERENCES","[J] Begier B. ~ Method of representation of subject matter in the computer system to teach pro~ammlng lan~ua~e~ Ph.D. Thesis /in Polish/, Reg.
