They help the reader understand and approve of the author*s new Ideas. These we call discourse propositions.","The definite article Is used An these two types of propositions In s different way:","- In language propositions, the definite article introduces the terms or expressions used to designate the concepts operative for the analysis presented by the author.","- In dlscqurs~ propositions, the definite article is used to introduce the terms or expressions which designate the examples, Illustrations which the author refers to in order to explain his theory to the reader. - III -","F~om this analysis of the use of the definite article An English scientific texts, there can be devised a quasi automatic content analysis of a scientific text, through the analysis of the words introduced by the definite articles In the text.","Fromthls analysis of the use of definite articles An scientific texts, we proceeded to an analysis of the defin-Ite article in literature.","We first worked on Victory by Joseph Conrad, and then on the ~ by Shakespeare.","From this analysis, we can say that, whether the author of a given text be a scientist or a poet, there is at work a logical process which can be traced through the use of the definite article.","The problem of the difference An the number of tames the definite article is used An scientific texts end An literature As due to the fact that the scientist has to demonstrate a theory, which is a purely logical process, whereas the poet aims at creating beauty end an J~aglnaT,y world which the reader must accept of. That Is why there As more emphasis In literature on whet we call ~ propositions than on what we call language propositions.","Nevertheless t there can be traced In both types of croat-Ave work some similar patterns through which the human mlnd finds and expresses new things, which can be Illustrated by an analysis of the use made ~y the author of the definite artlcle. - 112 -"]}]}
