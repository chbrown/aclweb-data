We demonstrate our \"integrated approach with examples from GOETHE, a natural language help system for UNIX as a complex domain. GOETHE (cf. Kese/ Oemig 1.989) has been developed together with OLIVETTI AI Center, Ivrea, and Tecsicl AI Lab, Rome, for UNIX V on the OLIVETTI LSX 30xxComputer Series. The present prototype includes a protocol for monitoring user's actions and has the natural language mode of interaction fully integrated into a graphical DeskTop under InterViews (based oll a cooperation with Fraunhofer Society, Stuttgart), thus allowing also for deictic natural language and graphical interactions. It covers all of UNIX' file handling, containing a static knowledge base of more than 70 UNIX programs. It is written in Quintus-PROLOG and C, and takes by average less than 10 seconds for generating an answer to a user's request. 361"]},{"title":"3 Requirements on Knowledge Representation and Semantics for a UNiX natural language help system","paragraphs":["It is the task of the knowledge base in a UNIX natural language help system to serve as a baals for correctly and adequately answering a user's questions in one of the following situations: (1) the user needs to know a UNIX cormnand, or series of commands in order to carry out a certain i:ask, (2) hc has sent off a I JNIX command and the system has resulted in a different .qa[e !ban he expected, or (3) he wants to gc.t irffcrmalion about a UNIX command. In g,.mcr~fl, !hi:; ',,,'ill require two knowledge ~,:)urces: 5'laEc knowledge about UNIX as a co]!c;ction of possible, man-machine interactions, and dynamic knowledge about the respc'cl.i-,e UNIX st:ate (in particular, inode~ a~d the associated files with their permissions), the u.-,~:t ...... s actions, and the i'\"' ...... \" r~:actions (in particular, error ': ~ l.,~ ill ,~ messages), it is the task of the semantic representation to provide ,t .. ,,'~c knowledge base manager wi:[t a corrc.ct and adequate semantic representation of [he user's input","Si[ ll[ff[ Ion) (in -~ spccii!ic : ' ' There basically are two strat¢oies..:, . available at this point.

For the purpost:s el! the GOETHE system, we have opted for the second alternative, because the cognitive misconceptions a user may have about UNIX not only cause him to invoke the help system, but also cause him in most cases to phrase his questions ~1 the way he does: If the system is presented with a semantically incorrect question, this is to be taken as an indication, that the user needs help, and a reminder that he better rephrase his question in a correct way will not be of much use to him. Of course, it would have also been possible to relax tile syntactic co-occurrence restrictions. In effect, however, this would have resulted in a duplication of knowledge base information in the lexicon. The second alternative, therefore, not only appears to be the more adequate, but also the more efficient solution."]},{"title":"4 Frame Semantics","paragraphs":["Output of the parser in GOETHE is a possibly incorrect, or incomplete, semantic representation where the meaning of tile individual- and predicate-constants of tile logical representation are represented as frame-theoretic icons (Hcyer et.al. :19881). We call this kind of semantic representation flame-semantics, or database-semantics (Hausser 1989). Taking the frame representation of UN[X (including attached procedares and, additionally, the protocolled history) as the context-model relative to which a user's input is interpreted, this flame-semantics allows for a simple and efficient processing of a semantic representation for correction, completion, or the retrieval of the requested information via the knowledge base manager. As an illustration, consider the following examples: 1) \"How can I edit a text named 'test\"?\"","[qword(how), [action(edit),","line(file) ,attr(name,test)]]] 362","2) \"Why didn't you list dir 'tc.stdir' sorted by date!\"","[qword(why-not),","[action(show), [so(directory),attr (narne,testdir)], [mo(file),quant(all)],","attr(name,_),","app(descending, attr(date,_))]] (Note that \"list directory\" = \"show all files\"; \"so\" = source object, \"too\" = main object, \"attr\" = attribute).
