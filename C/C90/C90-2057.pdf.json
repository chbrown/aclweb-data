For this reason, lexical transfer, the process of choosing the correct equivalent(s) for one lexical entry in another language, is one of the most ditticult problems that MT has to cope with. This paper focuses on one aspect of lexical transfer, namely the possibility to specify complex translations in the target language. Under this broad description, the use of complex (henceforth multiword) expressions, change of part-of-speech required bY translation, and collocation restrictions, are meant.. The process of actually choosing which entry (or entries) in the bilingual dictionary is more appropriate, and which in[brmation is taken into account for that process has been described elsewhere[ 13 I.

R.egarding the problem of lexical transfer, l'sujii[17] states \"we cannot enumerate, by monolingual thinking, different concepts denoted by the verb 'produce'. (...) Only when we are asked to translate sentences into another language, can we try to find appropriate target language words. (...) The above discussion bnplies that certain 'understanding proe-e~es\" are target language dependant, and cannot be fully specified in a monolingual manner.\" Specitically the problem of translating a word for an expression, is one of the reasons presented by Schenk[15] to -se the concept of \"Complex Basic Expressiorff in the de- ~;crlption of one language. (A CBE is a basic expression liom a semantic point of view, i.e., it corresponds to a basic mearfing, and a complex expression from a syntactical point of vie,,,,'.) \"Expressions that are not idiomatic, but that consist of more than one word can be handled by means of a complex basic expression in order to retain the isomorphyJ This approach is related to the theoretical requirement of Ihe Rosetta MT system to btfild isomorphic grammars for ihe several l:nlguages dealt with by tim system• \"Ibis implies that, in this ti'amework, it is the set of all languages in presence that delines what is a basic meaning. 15ke this, it is possible to dispense altogether with structural"]},{"title":"Irarlsfer~","paragraphs":["\"Structural transfer is not neees.rary, since idioms are based onto basic meaningsJ hx general, however, most M'F systems do not make the analysis phase dependant on the target language(s), and therefore it is usual to see statements like the following[4]: \"the lexical rule must mark words with the corresponding parts of speech,\", in the \"cases where a source language entry must be rephrased in the target language as an ad-hoe combination of words which does not form a lexieal entity\". It is unclear, however, how much complexity of the result can be handled, or how rnuch syntactical transfo,mation the new expression carl suffer. Some hybrid approaches cart also be found in [9], this time apparently putting the burden on the generation phase: \"The second substep of German morphological generation is the application of German word list transformations. (...) these rules can also be used to handle non-compositional translations. For example, \"for example\" can translate compositionally into far Beispiel, and then a GPltRASE rule can convert this to zum Beispiel.\" l lowever, the more comprehensive way to deal with this problcnL wilhout changing analysis accordingly, is the one cxemplilied by Isabcllc[7]. It was developed \"a special language called LEXTRA, which makes it easier to state the type of tree transformations required by lexical transfer. (...) LEXTRA takes as data an explicit description of the admissible tree structures, and guarantees that any tree it receives or creates is bMeed an admi~'ible tree\". Similar solutions can be found in the Japanese-to-I!nglish system of[10], which handles both lexical gaps and changes of part of speech: \"One can specify not only the Engh'sh main verbs but also arbitrmT phrases governed by the verbs as constants\", allowing for variables and complex patterns in tile lexical rules. \"one can provide lexieal rules directly in GRADE, and attach them to specific items. (...) One can specify specific tree transformations in GRADE\". and in the old ITS translation system[12]: \"The contents of these records\" (dictionary entries) \"#rclude transfer language statements which performs the necessary transfers as well as other referential information.\""]},{"title":"Parsing","paragraphs":["In parsing, idioms have to be considered. A recent paper on idiom processing[1] lists some of their relevant properties (my rephrasing): • usual existence of ambiguity between literal and","Miomatic readings, • frequent discontinuity of idioms, ® applicability of regular application of syntactic rules","(like adverb(s) or auxiliaJ T verb(s) insertion), • applicability of \"transformations' to the idioms proper,","(like passivation or relativization). The difference between \"non-literal reading\" and \"idiomatic\" reading of an expression is also pointed out. Metaphoric readings are proposed to be parsed by usu.:d rules. The advantages of submitting idioms to \"regular\" syntactic rules and even to 'transformations', whenever possible, are emphasized. A more extreme view can be found in Gazdar et all3 l, who ignore idioms as far as syntax is concerned: \"no additional devices need be added to the syntax in accounting for the peculiarities o f fixed expressions\". Since not only idioms can be assigned internal syntactic structure, but an internal semantic structure as well, as \"all syntactically active idiomatic expressions have a metaphorical basis\". However, radically different views can be found Ibr instance in [5], where, in the lexicon-grammar approach, the concern with the representation of compound words (adverbs, verbs, nouns) makes Gross establish a classilicalion according to their syntactical shape, ranging fiom several degrees of variation, li'om completely frozen (\"at night\") to having parts completely free (\"organize in one's honor\"). This author suggests that finite automata be attached to a given entry in Order to describe the compound wtriation. \"The variations of form we have enumerated can be partly handled by attaching a finite automaton to a given entry, and this automaton will describe the main grammatical changes allowed.\" In between, the need to store several pieces of infbrmation concerning idioms is acknowledged by Stockllf], such as 2"]},{"title":"331","paragraphs":["undergoing passivization, weight in the whole idiom, remover of the idiom interpretation, semantic value, etc. This system stores idioms as \"further information concerning words\", divided in two cases, \"canned phrases\" and \"flexible idioms\", the latter being stored under the 'thread' of tile idiom.

However, work in generation per se usually presupposes the existence of an unambiguous 'concept' representation, and so the problems begin with the correct stating of an idea in one particular language. In this framework, it is clear that one key concept is that of \"collocations\", or how lexical items combine in a particular language. In these systems, it is advocated (see for instance [6]) that in the specialized 'semantic\" dictionary \"storing the possible lexicalizations of a 'concept\" in a given language (...) the possibility of combining lexemes in collocations\" should also be stored, specifically in the entries for the bases (which determine the possible collocates: a collocation is a pair base-collocate). A remark of utmost importance can be found in [11], during the description of the DIOGENES generation system: \"collocalional relations are defined on lexical units, not meaning representations\"."]},{"title":"Summing up","paragraphs":["The literature survey above supports some of our assumptions, namely that","• there are problems which are bilingual in nature, and cannot therefore be properly dealt with in only one language;","• there is not a clear distinction between what should be accounted for as an idiom, a metaphorical use of a word or a collocation. The boundaries between collocational restrictions, metaphorical readings and idioms are blurred and may even not be pertinent to the automatic treatment of language. to translate correctly, it is often necessary to use expressions instead of single words. Those expressions can moreover give origin to complex structure changes, possibly discontinuous."]},{"title":"Our approach","paragraphs":["We are interested in solving the problem of translating one expression into another expression, no matter whether the need arises because of a lexical gap, a collocation difference or an idiom not literally translatable. Therefore, we treat all these three problems the same way, namely, considering then~ as instances of a contrastive lexical transfer problem in the scope of machine translation. We must emphasize that we are only interested in expression-to-expression translations when tile literal ones are not acceptable. This stems from the lhct that there is a considerable number of fixed expressions which do not require any special processing, as can be seen in the following list, with examples taken from several languages: (E) parents and children","pals e filhos (E) ladies and gentlemen","senhoras e senhores (F) monter la moutarde au nez de subir a mostarda ao nariz de (F) attendre un enfant","esperar uma crianqa um filho (E) take into account","tomar em conta (I) prendere il toro per le coma","pegar o touro pelos cornos (E) in good hands","em boas mY.os","Figure 3.
