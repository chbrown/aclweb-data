Laval (Qu6bec) H7V 2X2 CANADA Abstract. Lexicat Grammars are a class of unification grammars which share a fixed rule component, for which there exists a simple left-recursion elimination transformation. The parsing and generation programs ale seen as two dual non-left-recursive versions of the original grammar, and are implemented through a standard top-down Prolog interpreter. Formal criteria for termination are given as conditions on lexical entries: during parsing as well as during generation the processing of a lexical entry constimes some amount of a guide; the guide used for parsing is a list of words remaining to be analyzed, while the guide for generation is a list of the semantics of constituents waiting to be generated.

This is because the statement of the problem of reversibility is naturally synlmetrical: parsing is concerned with recovering semantic content from phonological content, generation phonological content from semantic content. It has been noted by several researchers ([$88], tN891, [SNMP891) that certain problems (left-recursion) and techniques (left-corner processing, linking, Ear!ey deduction) encountered in the parsing domain hJ,'e o,rrelates in the generation domain. It is then na!:ural to wy and see parsing and generation as instances of a single paradigm; [$881 and [D[88, DI90I are attempts in this direction, but are hindered by the fact that there is no obvious correlate in gene,'ation of the string indexing techniques so prominent in parsing {string indices in chart parsing, differential lists m DCG parsing).","Guides.

This gci~er,d notion ,,viii apply to both parsing aud generation, but it wi/! be instantiated differently in the va'o modes. The purpose of a guide is to orient the proof procedure, specific to either parsing or generation, in such a way that: (i) the guide is initialized as a direct function of the input (the string in parsing, thc semantics in generation), (it) the current stale of the ,~uide strongly constrains the next access lo the lexicon, (iii) after lexical access, the size of the guide strictly decreases (,gMde-consumption co~lditic.1, see section 3). Once a guide is specified, the generation problem (respectively the parsing problem I) then reduces to a problem fornml!y simihtr to the problem of parsing v, ith a DCG [PW80} containing no empty productions 2 (ie rules whose right-hand side is the empty string []).","Several parsing techniques can be applied to this problem; we will be concerned here with a top-down parsing approach directly implementable through a standard Prolog interpreter. This approach relies on a lefi-recl~r,sioll-climination trans/brmation for a certain class of definite clause programs (see section 33.","The ability 1o specify guides, for parsing or for generation, depends on certain compositionality hypotheses which the underlying grammar has to satisfy.

The parsing and generalion problems can be rendered tractable only if certain hypmheses are made concerning the composition of linguistic structures. Thus generation can be arduous if the semantics associated with the composition of two structures is the nm'estricted lambda-application 3 of tile first structure's semantics on the second structure's semantics: this is because knowledge of the mother's semantics does not constrain in a usable way the semantics of the daughters. 4 On the contrary, parsing is greatly simplified if the string associated with the composition of two strqctures is the concatenation of tile strings associated with each st,ucture: one can then use string indexing to orient and control tl'e progression of the parsing process, as is done in DCG under tile guise of \"dil'ferential lisls\".","l,e×ical Granlmar. The formalism of Lexical Grammar (LG) makes explicit certain compositionality hypotheses which ensure the existence of guides for parsing as well as for generation.","A Lexical Grammar has two parts: a (variable) lexicon and a (fixed) rule component.

Lexical Grammar","Rule component The fixed rule component of LG (see Fig. 3) describes in a generic way the combination of constituents.

Further research Handling extrapositinn with guides.","paragraphs":["The specific guides defined above for parsing and generation are not the only possible ones. If for some reason certain conditions on the lexicon are to be relaxed, then more sophisticated guides must and can be defined.","Thus, the guide introduced above for parsing essentially assumes that no lexical entry has an empty string realization. This condition may be too strict for certain purposes, such as handling traces. Interestingly, however, the guide consumption condition can still be imposed in these cases, if one takes care to suitably enrich the notion of guide.","I,et us assume, fl)r instance, that there be a general syntactic constraint to the effect that two empty lexical"]},{"title":"6 95","paragraphs":["items cannot immediately follow each other 19. Let us then posit as a guide structure, instead of a list L of words, a couple <L,B>, where B is a variable restricted to taking values 0 or 1. Suppose further that these couples are ordered \"lexicographically\", ie that:","VL, L',B,B' L < L' ~ <L,B> < <L',B'> L= L'A B<B' ~ <L,B> < <L,B'>. It is easy to see that the set of guides is then a partially ordered set which respects the descending chain condition.","Let us finally assume that term_p' is redefined in the following manner:","term p'(A,<Lin,Bin>,<Lout,Bout>) :- term(A), append( A.strin g ,Lout,Lin ) , ( A.string = [], Bin =l, Bout = 0 ; A.string #[],Bin = ,Bout = 1 ). It can be shown that this definition of guide_parse is sufficient to ensure the guide-consumption condition, and therefore guarantees the termination of the parsing process.","Variations on this idea are possible: for instance, one could define the guide as a couple <L,X> where X is a list of left-extraposed constituents (see [P81]). Any time a constituent is added to the extraposition list X, this operation is required to consume some words from L, and any time a trace is encountered, it is required to \"cancel\" an element of X. Because the lexicographical order defined on such guides in the following way:","k'L,L',X,X' L < L' -~ <L,X> < <L',X'> L= L' ,,~ X < X' ~ <L,X> < <L,X'>. respects the descending chain condition, the parsing process will be guaranteed to terminate."]},{"title":"6. Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper shows that parsing and generation can be seen as symmetrical, or dual, processes exploiting one and the same grammar and lexicon, and using a basic l<ft-recursion elimination transformation. Emphasis is on the simplicity and symmetry of linguistic description, which is mostly contained in the lexicon; compositionality appears under three aspects: string compositionality, semantic compositionality, and syntactic compositionality. The analysis and generation processes each favor one aspect: string compositionality in analysis, semantic compositionality in generation. These give rise to two guides (analysis guide and generation guide), which are generalizations of string indexes. The left-recursion elimination transformation described in the paper is stated using the general notion of guide, and is provably guaranteed, under certain explicit conditions, to lead to termination of the parsing and generation processes. We claim that the approach provides a simple, yet powerful solution to the problem of grammatical bidirectionality, and are currently testing it as a possible replacement for a more rule-oriented 19 A counter-example to this simplistic assumption is not hard to come by: the person who I john persuaded e I PRO to drink. However, the assumption gives the flavor of a possible set of strategies for handling empty categories. grammatical component in the context of the CRITTER translation system [!DM88]."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to Michel Boyer, Jean-Luc Cochard and Elliott Macklovitch for discussion and comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[D90a] Dymetman, Marc.
