Many existing approaches to machine translation take for granted that the information presented in the out-put is found somewhere in the input, and, moreover, that such information should be expressed at a single representational level, say, in terms of the parse trees or of \"semantic\" mssertions. Languages, however, not only express the equivalent information by drastically different linguistic means, but also often disagree in what distinctions should be expressed linguistically at all. For example, in translating from Japanese to English, it is often necessary to supply determiners for noun phr;tses, and this ira general cannot be (lone with-out deep understanding of the source ~ text. Similarly, in translating fl'om English to Japanese, politeness considerations, which in English are implicit in tile social situation and explicit in very diffuse wws ira, for examl)le, tile heavy use of hypotheticals, must be realized grammatically in Japanese. Machine translation therefore requires that the appropriate infer- (noes be drawn and that the text be interpreted to stone depth (see Oviatt, 1988). Recently, an elegant approach to inference in discourse interpretation has been developed at a number of sites (e.g., ltobbs et al., 1988; Charniak and Goldman, 1988; Norvig, 1987), all based on tim notion of abduction, and we have begun to explore its potential application to machine translation. We argue that this approach provides the possibility of deep reasoning and of mapping between the languages at a variety of levels.

In the TACITUS Project at SRI, we have developed a scheme for abductive inference thatyields a significant simplification in the description of interpretation processes and a significant extension of the range of phenomena that can be captured. It has been implemented in the TACITUS System (Itobbs et al., 1988, 1990; Stickel, 1989) and has been applied to several varieties of text. The framework suggests the integrated treatment of syntax, semantics, and pragmattes described below. Our principal aim in this paper is to examine the utility of this frmnework as a model for translation.","In the abductive framework, what the interpretation of a sentence is can be described very concisely: '.Ib interpret a sentence:","(1) Prove tile logical form of the sentence, together with the constraints that","predicates iml)ose on their","arguments, allowing for coercions,","Merging redundancies where possible,","Making assumptions where necessary. By the first line we mean \"prove from the predicate calculus axioms in tile knowledge base, the logical 1 155 form that. has been produced by syntacl.ic analysis and selnantic translation of t.he sentence.\"","In a discourse situation, the speaker and hearer hotll have their sets of private belieN, and there is a. large overlapping set of mutual beliefs. An utterance stands with one foot in nmtual belief and one foot in the speaker's private beliefs. It is a bid to extend the area of mutual belief to include some private beliefs of the speaker's. It is anchored referentially in mutual belief, and when we prove the logical form and the constraints, we are recognizing this referential anchor. This is the given in formation, the definite, the presupposed. Where it is necessary to make assumptions, the information comes from the speaker's private beliefs, and hence is the new information, the indefinite, the ~sserted. Merging redundancies is a way of getting a minimal, and hence a best, interpretat, ion.","An Example.

One can state transfer rules between two languages at various levels of linguistic abstraction, and between different levels of the respective languages. Such freedom in transfer is exactly what is needed for translation, especially for such typologically dissimilar languages as English and Japanese. It is thus possible to build a single system for translating among more than two languages in this framework, incorporating the labor savings of interlingual approaches while allowing the convenient specifieities of transfer approaches.","We should note that other translations for sentence (2) are possible in different contexts.
