The morphological analyzer analyzes a consecutive sequence of characters and identifies word and phrase boundaries. Japanese morphological analysis is a relatively well established technology (Maruyama et al. 1988) and intervention by the user is seldom required, although the system does provide a facility for this.","A Japanese syntactic structure is depicted by modifier-modifiee relationships between phrases. The dependency analyzer determines the modifiee of each phrase. This is the most difficult task and normally user interaction takes place at this stage. First, the system determines the modifiee candidates of each phrase by using the grammar rules, and builds a data structure called a constraint network. The grammar rules are based on Constraint Dependency Grammar (Maruyama 1990), and are essentially constraints between modifications. The constraint network holds the modifiee candidates of each phrase, and the grammatical constraints are posed between the candidates.","The system then proposes the most plausible reading and displays it on the screen along with the other possibilities. If the human user is satisfied with the proposal or does not want to make any decision, he tells the system to 'go ahead' and the proposal is passed through to the transfer component as the unique parsing result. Alternatively, tile user can select an arbitrary phrase and choose its modifiee from the rest of the candidates. The system incorporates this information into the constraint network, makes another proposal, and shows it to the user. This process is iterated until no more ambiguity remains. During analysis, the constraint propagation engine keeps tile constraint network locally consistent by using the constraint prvpagation algorithm (Waltz 1975).","Before the unique parse tree is submitted to the transfer component, JAWB performs some 'post processing' on the tree. This processing includes resolving remaining lexical ambiguities, giving grammatical relations such as SUBJ and DOBJ, and transforming a passive-voice structure into an active-voice structure. Since making such decisions requires expert knowledge about Japanese linguistics and/or the system's internal structure, it is preferable that this process is carried out automatically. Since correct modifier-modifiee relationships are given at the previous stage, this process makes few errors without huo man intervention."]},{"title":"258 2","paragraphs":["Ssent = { [phrase=l, string ='' & f£ ~,2 ~\" (anataga), cat=rip, mcat=pred modifier, modif J ee-~{~,2,3,4,5Y,}, words:: .[","[string ='' ~t£ ~',i\" (anata) ,"]},{"title":"syn=-[Y.

A sentence is a sequence of phrases, each of which is represented as a feature structure. Some of the values are enclosed by special brackets {% and %}, representing di.sj~Lrtctio'ns or choice t)oints. Phrase 1 in Figure 2, for example, contains two choice points, one for structural ambiguity (the modifiee slot) and the other tor lexical ambiguity (tile sgn slot of the first word). In Japanese, every phrase except the last one modifies exactly one phrase on its right. 1 Therefore, the modifiee of phrase 1 is one of the four succeeding phrases.","The grammatical rules that we need here are as follows: for X in $sen~ begin /* GI. pred_modifier modifies a pred */ (X.mcat=pred modifier =>","Ssent.(X.modifiee).eat in {vp,adjp,adjvp} )~ /* G2. noun_modifier modifies a noun */ (X.mcat=noun modifier =>","Ssent.(X.modifiee).cat in {np} ) end for X,Y in Ssent begin /* G3. modifications do not cross */ X.phrase<Y.phrase & Y.phrase<X.modifiee => Y.modifiee <= X.modifiee end","According to the above rules, tile modifiee (i.e., the governor) of phrase 1 (you-SUBJ) is either phrase 3 (meet-PAST) or phrase ,5 (see-PAST), since phrase 1 is a predicate-modifier and phrases 3 and ,5 are predicates. Similarly, phrase 2 can modify either phrase 3 or phrase 5. The values of the modifiee slot of each phrase thus become as follows: phrase i : modifiee={~,3,5~,} phrase 2: modifiee={~,3,5~,} phrase 3 : modifiee=-[~,4~,} phrase 4: modifiee={~,SYo}","Because modification links do ,lot cross each other (by rule"]},{"title":"G3),","paragraphs":["tile cases of phrase 1 modifying phrase 3 and phrase 2 modifying phrase 5 do not co-occur.

The number of parse trees may combinatorially explode when the sentence becomes long. For example, sentences with more than 20 phrases are not rare and such sentences may have tens of thousands of parse trees. User Interface The essential portion of the user interface is shown in Figure 3. The system does not display the proposed modifiees of all the phrases at once. Instead, when the user moves the cursor to a phrase by using a mouse, the proposed modifiee and the other possible candidates are highlighted. In the figures, the current phrases pointed to by the cursor are underscored, the proposed modifiees are in reversed video, and the other modifiee candidates are in a shaded box. 2 The number appearing at the left lower corner of each phrase shows the number of modifiee candidates of the current phrase. 2These are in different colors on the real screen. If this number is one, the modifiee is uniquely determined. Otherwise, the modifiee of the phr~e is ambiguous.","Figure 3-a shows the screen when the cursor is on phrase 1 (you-SUB J). Phrase 1 can modify either phrase 3 or phrase 5, and the system's proposal is phrase 5. Figure 3-b shows the screen when the cursor is o11 phrase 2. By moving the cursor oi1 tile phrases, the user can check the current system proposal. If tile user is satisfied with it, he indicates this by clicking a special 'go-ahead' icoq. Otherwise, he has to select the proper candidates.","The user selects one of the ambiguous phrases by clicking tile mouse, moves the cursor to its proper modifiee, and clicks the mouse again. The second click triggers the constraint propagation engine, and the updated situation is displayed instantaneously. Figure 4 shows the situation after the user has instructed the system that phrase 1 modifies phrase 3. The reader may notice that the modifiee of phrase 2 is also determined automatically because of constraint propagation.","During parsing, the user always has the initiative in the interaction. The user knows the exact sources of the structral ambiguity, and he can select any of them to give information to the system. This is in contrast to the previous systems, in which the user must answer system-generated queries one by one. The constraint propagation engine ensures that the given information is maximally used in order to minimize further interaction. The user also has the option of saying ~go-ahead' 260 4 1 1 1 1","you-SgBJ yester- meet-PAST man- see-day 0BJ PAST 1 1 1 1","you-SllBJ yester- meet-PAST man- see-day 0BJ PAST Figure 4: Screens after specifying that phrase 1 modifies phrase 3 at any time, taking the default choices proposed by the system."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation","paragraphs":["One of tile claims of JAWB is that it can be used by non-expert users. To validate the claim, we conducted a comparative test with an expert user and a non-expert user. Figure 5 shows the results of the test. Subject A is one of the authors who actually developed the grammar. Subject B is a Japanese native speaker with no background in linguistics or computer science. Given an initial screen of dependency analysis, subject A spent 12.9 seconds on the average before making a correct parse tree. This period includes the time spent specifying the proper modifiees (1.1 times oii average) and verifying the system proposals, but does not include overheads such as the time spent choosing a new sentence to be analyzed and waiting for the system to look up dictionaries from a disk. The same task took 18.8 seconds for subject B. The important point here is that although the performance is somewhat different, tile parse trees generated by both subjects were essentially identical, a This means that, with a non-expert human user's help, JAWB is capable of producing very reliable parse trees fairly efficiently, although the efficiency can be increased by about 50% if an expert user uses it.","Another yardstick for evaluating the system is the accuracy of the initial proposals. From 1,089 test sentences taken from actual newspaper arti~","3There were differences when the sentence was truly ambiguous, in which case even a human user could not resolve the ambiguity without the context knowledge. cles, JAWB generated correct initial proposals for 507 sentences (47%), which means that, if it is used in a flfll-automatic mode, its accuracy is 47%. On the other hand, the system rejected two sentences as ungrammatical, which means that for 99.8% of the test sentences, JAWB was capable of producing correct parse trees with appropriate user interaction. 5"]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["JAWB is currently being used to accumulate correct parse trees for a corpus of texts. The accumulated data are vital for the development of our machine translation system for at least two reasons:","1. The transfer component, which generates an English syntactic structure from a Japanese syntactic structure, is difficult to develop without having enough error-free input data, that is, Japanese parse trees.","2. The accumulated parse trees are used as reliable linguistic data from which various statistical data are obtained in order to refine the grammar rules.","We believe that interactive source language analysis is a promising approach to practical machine translation not only because it may significantly reduce the task of post editing, which should be carried out by a professional translator, but also because tile cost-saving effect is multiplied when the same text is translated into several different languages. 5 261","Sentence length","(~p of phrases) 1-3 4-6 7-9 10- 12 13- 15 16- 18 19 - 21 Ave. time (see.)
