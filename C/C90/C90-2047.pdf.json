After a general introduction to the Italian pronominal system, I will review centering, and then show how the original rules given in [GJW86] have to be extended or modified. Finally, I will show that centering does not account for two phenomena: first, the functional role of an utterance may override the predictions of centering; second, a null subject can be used to refer to a whole discourse segment. This latter phenomenon should ideally be explained in the same terms that the other phenomena in-volving null subject are."]},{"title":"1 The Italian pronominal system","paragraphs":["In Italian, there are two pronominM systems, characterized by a different syntactic distribu-tion: weak pronouns, that must always be cliffcized to the verb (e.g. ]a, ]o, li, le - respectively her, accusative; him, accusative; them, masculine, accusative; them, feminine, accusative or her, dative), and strong pronouns (lui, lei, Ioro - respectively he or him; she or her; they or them). The null subject can be considered as belonging to the system of weak pronouns. Notice that in Italian there is no neuter gender: nouns referring to inanimate objects are masculine or feminine. The weak pronouns used in this case are those of the corresponding gender, while, when a strong pronoun has to be used, paraphrase or deictics","*This research was supported by DARPA grant no. N0014-85--K0018. are preferred. A strong pronoun for inanimate objects does exist - esso for masculine, essa for feminine, but it is not much used in current Italian.","Weak and strong pronouns are often in complementary distribution, as the following example shows - the contrast is between the use of the null or overt pronoun in subject position 1: Ex. 1 a)"]},{"title":"b)","paragraphs":["Quando Carlo/ ha incontrato Marioj, When Carlo/ has met"]},{"title":"Marioj,","paragraphs":["Oi/.j non gli.i/j ha nemmeno detto \"ciao\". he//,/ not to-him//,) has even said \"hi\".

The overt pronoun lui in subject position requires its referent to be Mario, and therefore gli has to refer to Carlo.","There are some syntactic accounts of coref-erence phenomena in Italian, for example Calabrese's [Cal86]. He starts from the observation that weak pronouns are used in all those contexts in which there is an expected referent for the pronoun itself; he claims that we cannot use strong pronouns in place of weak ones, and vice","2 versa","1¢ indicates a null subject and can be translated as an unstressed pronoun in English. In all the examples I will be using, if a proper name ends in -o or -i, it has a male referent; if it ends in -a, a female referent. The translations I provide are literal and generally word by word.","2Actually Calabrese classifies pronouns as unstressed / stressed, and not as weak / strong, but I think his terminology may lead the reader to a wrong conclusion. In fact, while the \"unstressed\" pronouns can never be stressed, the \"stressed\" pronouns can, but not necessarily ~re. 270 1","To formalize the concept of expected referent, :he resorts to the notion of Thema, defined as the subject of a primary predication, where x is a primary predicate of y iff x and y form a constituent which is either O-marked or [+ INFL]. tie then says that a pronoun in position of 'rhema is expected to have another Thema as antecedent, and that if this coindexing occurs, the pronoun must be a weak one.","Through these definitions and rules he manages to account for a wide range of data, as far as single sentences are concerned, but when he tries to extend them to discourse, their useful-hess and predictive power is not sufficient, and ,~ometimes they give the wrong prediction. This is partly due to his very simplistic view of discourse, which he considers as a conjunction of sentences. Even for those sentences in which this view is sufficient, the argument that coref-erence depends only on the syntactic structure of the discourse and that we cannot use a weak pronoun when the theory predicts that a strong one is expected does not hold. Consider the following example: Ex. 2 D1) a)"]},{"title":"b) De) a)","paragraphs":["b) Ieri Carloi ha incontrato Marioj. Yesterday Carloi has met Marioj."]},{"title":"¢,/,j","paragraphs":["Non gli,i/j ha nemmeno detto \"ciao\". Hei not to-himj has even said \"hi\". Ieri Carloi ha incontrato Mariaj. Yesterday Carloi has met Mariaj."]},{"title":"¢,ilj","paragraphs":["Non gl|i/,j ha nemmeno detto \"ciao\". Shej not to-himi has even said \"hi\". Calabrese's analysis correctly explains the allowed and disallowed coreferences in DI: Mario is not the Thema of Dl.a. So, if we want to have the subject of Dl.b refer to Mario, we can- .aot use a weak pronoun, but we have to use a ~trong one: in fact, if we do use a null subject, it is interpreted as referring to Carlo.","Let's now consider D2. The structure of the I;wo discourses is exactly the same. Therefore I;he theory predicts that, if we want to refer to Maria, which is not the Thema of D2.a, we have t;o use a strong pronoun, and not a null one: in- ~:vtead, D2,b is almost perfect. The reason is that in D2.b the null subject has two potential referents, one male and the other :lbmale. While processing the sentence, the pos- ,ibility that the null subject refers to Carlo is culed out when the clitic gli, marked for masculine, is found. In fact, gli has to refer to Carlo; given that gli is not reflexive, it cannot corefer with the subject, therefore the latter is forced to refer to Maria. This kind of disambiguation cannot be performed in Dl.b, in which the null subject has two potential referents of the same gender.","I should mention that Calabrese, at the beginning of his paper, says that such features [gender, number and person] allow a first selection among the possible refe~ents which are assigned to the pronominal. Presumably he would use these features as a superimposed filter to be applied to the whole sentence after it ha~s been completely read or heard.","Itowever, this could hardly fit in a model of how people process discourse: it is very likely that the normal human mode of operation is in-cremental [Ste89]. My claim is that disambiguation clues have to be taken into account as soon as they are available while processing a sentence. We will see in fact that they can help to make a discourse coherent or not according to their position in the sentence.","Notice that the issue here is to account not so much for the grammatieality or ungrammaticality of a sentence, as pure syntactic accounts do, but for more or less coherence in a discourse: this is exactly the purpose of centering theory. in particular, centering relates discourse coherence with the inference load that a certain sequence of utterances, and especially a certain choice of referring expressions, requires on the part of the hearer.","In the next section, I'll show how centering theory can be useful to explain certain uses of Italian pronouns in discourse, and in turn, how a richer pronominal system caz~ help to refine the rules that centering uses."]},{"title":"2 Centering theory","paragraphs":["It is now widely accepted that discourse is divided into segments (see for example [Web88]); a discourse is coherent when its constituent segments exhibit both local coherence - namely, coherence among the utterances of each individual segment, and global coherence - namely, coherence among the different segments.","Centering is an account of local coherence: it tries to determine the entity which an utterance most centrally concerns. Besides, it assesses the 271 coherence Of a discourse in terms of the different moves that a speaker can do (basically, going on to talk about the same entity or switching to another one), and in terms of how these moves are encoded, in particular as far as the choice of referring expressions is concerned. According to [GJW86], discourse coherence is a measure of the infhrence load a certain discourse imposes on a hearer. Notice that the view I am taking on centering is as a theory of discourse production. From [GJW86], it is not very clear whether centering concerns the production or the comprehension of discourse.","More technically, there are three moves that a speaker can perform, for every triple of utterances"]},{"title":"U~, Un+I, Un+2,","paragraphs":["belonging to the same segment: DEF."]},{"title":"!","paragraphs":["Continuation:"]},{"title":"Un","paragraphs":["and gn+l concern the same entity; it is likely that Un+2 will concern it too.

This assumption is definitely plausible, but it does not say anything about ordering among the other Cf's. For a more detailed analysis of the factors affecting Cf's ordering, see Kameyama' s application of centering to Japanese [Kam85], and for more recent work on this topic, [WIC90].

Hej has gotten angry(-masc.) because h% was sleeping.","Various interesting facts come out from the four U3 variations 6.","[a] The null subject refers to Maria, who, according to the rules in the previous section, is Cb(U3.a), and the highest ranked element in Cf(U3.a). U3.a thus demonstrates center continuation. The discourse is perfectly coherent.","[b] The most natural interpretation is that the null subject in the main clause refers to Maria - the null subject in the subordinate clause is forced to refer to Giovanni on pragmatic grounds. However, for this same pragmatic reason, on second thought the null subject in the mMn clause may be interpreted as referring to Giovanni, but the discourse sounds less coherent.","[el The speaker perfonas a felicitous center shifting by referring to Giovanni with an overt pronoun, given that Giovanni was not Cb(U2), and not even the highest Cf(U2).","[d] Contrast this utterance with [b]. They should have the same effect on the hearer, namely, the null subject should be interpreted as referring to Maria: instead in [d] it is felicitously interpreted as referring to Giovanni. This happens because in [d] the verb is in the present perfect tense 7; the past participle agrees with the subject, and its masculine morphology forces the referent of the null subject to be Giovanni, and not Maria.","It seems to me that Ex.4 and other similar examples point to the following generalizations:","• typically, the speaker encodes center continuation with a null subject. This agrees with Kameyama's analysis of Japanese [Kam85]);","~As a warning to the reader, notice that I am not worrying about the interpretation of the null snbject in the subordinate causal clause, as it does not affect the interpretation of the null subject in the main clause, and it is affected by pragmatic reasons.","TThe temporal relation between the preceding discourse and [d] is not right; U2 should also be in the past perfect.

This actually depends on the perspective from which we look at clausal reference: it is possible that entities corresponding to discourse segment.s are implicitly included in the Cf's set; or that they are avMlable for reference, but they have a status different from the normal Cf's; or that they have a different status altogether, for example that they do not exist as centered entities until they are referred to for the first time [WebS8].","In any of these three cases, a theory of discourse coherence should at least partly address the problem."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, 1 have shown how the context up to argot including the verb helps in disambiguat-ing the reference for a null subject.","Some topics for future research have been discussed in the previous section.
