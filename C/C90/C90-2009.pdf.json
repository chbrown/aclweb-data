Uniform treatments of movements, arbitrary number of movement non-terminals, automatic detection of grammar errors beforehand, and clear declarative semantics are its specific features. Many common linguistic phenomena of Chinese sentences are represented with this fornmlism. For example, topic-comment structures, the ba-constructions, the bei-constructions, relative clause constructions, appositive clause constructions, and serial verb constructions.

In reality, it shows the specific pattern: topic-comment structure in Mandarin Chinese. Topicalization may be deemed one of the movement transformations. Examples (b) and (c) specify an object is moved to the topic position. Examples (d) and (e) are sentences with multiple topics. We can realize that the more predicates a sentence includes, the more topic positions it has. And thus, the more complicated patterns may be generated. It is good for the language users, however, it is difficult to process this type of languages in computer.","Chinese is also a highly context-sensitive hmguage. There are so many phenomena, e.g. index assigmnent, case marking, etc., depending on the context information even within a Chinese sentence. The index assignments in the topic-comment patterns shown above explain this point. Examples (d) attd (e) are legal interpretations. However, their bindings are different. The former is a serial binding, and the latter is a crossed binding. Serial binding is qot always true. For example, the index assignment cannot be","* Inp-Z'~-~Ji]t=L=li , [np Lff. a:- ~ ~lj, ~[J~ ~-~d~ i~,.'~ tj Is ~:~","ti]o","* [np Mr. Lee] i, [tap these books]j, I have told tj [s that","they want ti]. This is because the object that someone told must be an animate. Therefore, the index assignment, which is a necess,'uy step toward correct interpretation of natural language sentences, is difficult in computer.","This paper proposes a Government-Binding approach to deal with these highly flexible and context-sensitive languages such as Mandarin Chinese. It is organized as follows. Section 2 specifies the concepts of Government-Binding Theory. Section 3 gives a fortnal definition of Government-Binding based logic grammars. Section 4 demonstrates a Chinese parser from several context-sensitive constructions, and touches on the simple pronoun resolution within a Chinese sentence. Section 5 concludes the remarks. 2. Government-Binding Theory","Government-Binding (GB) Theory/Chomsky 1981, Sells 1985/is the descendant of Transformation Grammars/Radford 1981/. Its simplified organization is shown in Figure 1. Move - c~ , which is a general operation, moves anything anywhere between d-structure and s-structure, and between s-structure and logical foma. GB Theory includes a series of modules that contain constraints and principles which govern the movement transformation.","The Projection Principle preserves the syntactic information and the semantic information at each level (d-structure, s-structure, and logical form) during the movement transformation. Trace Theory postulates that there exist various empty categories at various levels of mental representation."]},{"title":"48 1 1.","paragraphs":["Projection Principle d-structure s-structure - logical form 2. Empty Category 3. Binding Theory Fil;ure 1. Government-Binding Theory Thus, we must have the capabilities to verify the relationship between the moved constituent and the empty constituent. GB Theory provides several mechanisms for the verification. The Empty Category Principle (ECP) says \"A trace must be properly governed.\" That is, we must find some cx that c-commands the trace /3 . And cx binds /3 iff (a) c, c-commands/3 , and (b) a and /3 are co-indexed. Their definitions are based on C-Command Condition. The C-Command Condition states the following:","a c-eomman&/3 if and only if the first branchit,g ~,ode dominating et also dominates /3, and ct does not itselJ dominate t3. It states a co-reference relation between a moved element and its mtce. The Subjaeency Condition is given in the following:","Any application of Move - e~ may not cross more than one bounding node. [t specifies island consuaints on the moved constituents.","The Binding Theory/Sells 1985/shownbelow is used for simple pronoun resolution: (Principle A) An anaphor is bound in its Governing Category. (Principle B) A pronominal is free in its Governing Category. (Principle C) An R-expression is free. Anaphors include reflexive and reciprocals, pronominals include pronouns, and R-expressions include all other noun phrases.","3. A Government-Binding Based Logic Grammar Formalism","The formal definition of Government-Binding based Logic Grammars (GBLGs) is specified incrementally in the following. Definition 1. A Government-Binding based Logic Grammar is a 6-tuple GBLG = (T,2,B,S,C,R) where:","(1) T is the set of lexical terminals. Each lexical terminal is denoted by an atomic formula with lexical category as its predicate symbol.","(2) ,'~ is the set of non-terminals. Y. = ZI' U ~]v k) ]~M k) ~G where:","(a) Zp is the set of phrasal non-terminals. Each phrasal non-terminal is represented by an atomic formula with phrasal category as its predicate symbol.","(b)Y. V is the set of virtual non-terminals. Each virtual non-terminal is specified by an atomic formula.","(c)Y. M is the set of movement non-terminals. A movement :non-terminal is one of the following two forms:","A<<<BorB>>>AwhereAETk) ~pt9 ~v,and B E ~V\" ]~-7'LM and ~RM denote the set of non-terminals A <<< B and the set of non-terminals B >>> A, respectively.","(d)~ G is the set of goals. Each goal is denoted by a literal.","(3) B C ~p is the set of bounding non-terminals. A botmding non-terminal is a phrasal non-terminal with bounding node as its predicate symbol.","(,4) S E ~p is the start non-terminal. (5) C is the set of logic connectives 'and' and 'or' that are","denoted by ',' and ';' respectively. A grammar element is","defined rccursivcly in terms of logic connectives as follows:","(a) A lexical tm'minal L E T is a grammar element.","(b)A phrasal non-terminal P E ~p is a grammar element. (c) A virtual non-terminal V E .~v is a grammar element. (d)A movement non-terminal M ~ ~M is a grammar","element. (e)A goat E ~JG is a grammm\" element. (f) If A and B are grammar elements, then (A,B) and","(A;B) are g,ammar elements.","The first five types are called basic grammar elements, and the","last one is a compound grammar element. Let G t and G E be the","set of basic granmaar elements and the set of compound","grammar elements, respectively.","(6) R is the set of production rules. A production rule is","of the following form:","X 0 °-> X l C l X 2 C 2 ... C(m.l) Xm where X 0 < ~l,,","X i E G E for 1 _< i _< m, and","C i g2 C for I £ i _< (m-1). It is obvious each production rule can be translated into a sequence of production rules with the logical operator 'and' only. An example written with this formalism is shown as","follows. It captures the relative clauses in English like \"The","man who he met is a teacher.\" (rl) s-->np, vp. (r2) np --> pronoun. (r3) np --> det, notm. (r4) np--> det, noun, rel. (r5) vp -.-> tv, np.

(2) for any grammar element X i = (B >>> A) E ~RM' there must exist some Xj, 1 _<j < i, such that (Xj, B) E TR. A logic grammar GBLG is significant if each production rule E R is significant. The above sample grammar is significant for the following reasons: (1) The rules (rl) - (r7) are significant trivially. (2) The rule","tel --> rel pronoun <<< trace, s is significant because there exists a transitive relation TR 1 such that s TR 1 vp TR l trace."]},{"title":"Proposition","paragraphs":["1. The c-command condition is embedded implicitly in GBLGs if these grammars are significant. Proof. For a significant production rule:","X 0 --> X l, X 2 ..... X m if X i = (A <<< B) E ~LM then there must exist some Xj (i < j < m), such that Xj dominates the virtual non-terminal B in the other production rule. The phrasal non-terminal X 0 is the first branching node that dominates A and Xj, and thus also dominates B. Therefore, A c-commands B. X i = (B >>> A) E ~RM has the similar behavior.","This property can be used to check the con'ectness of granmwas automatically before parsing. Definition 4.

(2) Many categories may appear in the topic position, e.g. n\", s', v\", or p\". (3) There may be multiple topics in a sentence. (4) The comment may not contain a constituent which is anaphorically related to the element in the topic.","Under the above observations, topic may be represented as:","topic(topic(N2bar),n2bar,Semanfic,Index,Case) -->","n2bar(N2bar,Semantic,Index,Case,Classifier).

Each a that is outside of this range should not have a co-index relationship with 13. This principle defines two sets for/3.

Conclusion and Remarks","Many natural langt, ages are flexible and context-sensitive. Mandarin Chinese is a famous example. It is difficult to capture tile linguistic phenoinena lot these languages in computer. This paper adopts GB Theory to deal with this problcm. According to GB Theory, the rule of 'move - a' moves anything anywhere, and the universal princil~les operate interactively to rule out the illegal movements. Thus, the only things shoukt be declared in tim grammars ree:","(1) which phrases are the possible empty constituents,","(2) which positions are their possible empty sites,","(3) which positions are their possible landing sites,","(4) which phrasal categories are bounding nodes. In such cases, a robnst parser for n:ttural hmguages can be designed. As an example, we represent many context-sensitive constructions in Mandarin Chinese, and do case marking and index assignment for Chinese sentences. An experime,mfl Chinese parser is running under the euvironments: (1) Vax-I 1/785, (2) Quintus Prolog, (3) lexicon with about 200 words (about 33K bytes), and (4) about 150 production rules (about l I2K bytes). Besides movement transformation, pronotm resolution is another index assignment. For well treatment o[ pronoun resolt, tion, the syntactic knowledge is not enough. This is because the Binding Theory tells us much the impossible pair, but little the possible pair. Much more semantic information should be included.","Moreover, our GB approach is also useft,1 when we would like to compose logical formulae from their syntactic counterparts. The idea is that the mapping between d-structure and s-struc.ture, as well as between s-structure and logical form are treated in the similar way. The movement transformation between d-structure and s-structure tells us the relationship anaong verb and its accolnpanying arguments. The skeleton of the given 'verb is defined in tile lexicon, and base-generated in the d-structure. For example,","'N '(Subject,Object) (buy(Subject,Object)). The index assignment relates ~' (book) to the verb '.~:~ ' (buy) in the following sentence:","(There is one bcmk i that every student bought ti.) Because the variable of the type -~- ' (book) and the second argument of the template 'N '(Subject, Object) (buy(Subject, Object)) should be the same in the logical form, the index (a unique integer) can be changed into a variable, say X. That is, they share the same variable shown below:","exist(X,'i~ '(X),forall(Y,'-~ ~L'(Y),'N '(Y,X)))","(exist(X,book(X),forall(Y,student(Y),buy(Y,X)))). The formtfla tells us the SVO-SOV inversion in the logical tbrm. This phenomenon can be added into our parser easily with our formalism.
