Work on incremental parsing and interpretation is typically motivated by a desire to model, or mimic, (aspects of) this behaviour, for example, Bobrow and Webber (1980), Ades and Steedman (1982), Mellish (1985), Pulman (1985), and Haddock (1987~ 1988~ 1990).","tlowever, there are also clear-cut computational reasons for trying to attain incrernentality. Sparked","This research has been supported by the National Swedish Board for Technical Development. off by the rapid development of increasingly powerful, distributed computer hardware, a paradigm of \"immediate computation\" is gaining popularity in interactive applications like WYSIWYG word processing, spreadsheet programs, and programminglanguage editors (Reps and Teitelbaum 1984, 1987). It is interesting to consider similar systems applied to interactive natural-language processing. The point is that incrementality is a prerequisite of the reactiw~, real~time-based behaviour of such systems. Furthermore, systems that mix for example deictic and natural-language input require that linguistic status be given to sentence fragments, thus demand-ing incremental analysis (Kobsa et al. 1986).","One body of work which appears to be usefifl in incremental parsing and interpretation is re,on (or truth) maintenanceJ A reason-maintenance system (RMS) supports incremental formation and revision of beliefs. By viewing the construction of partial analyses of a text as analogous to forming beliefs about the meanings of its parts, a relation between parsing and reason maintenance can be conceived.","An RMS is coupled with an inference engine (for example, a parser) which makes inferences within the problem domain, and the overall, combined system can be seen as an inferential problem solver. The RMS makes use of two data structures, nodes and justifications. A node represents a datum provided by the inference engine, such as an assumption or an inferred proposition. Whenever a datum is inferred from a conjunction of other data, the RMS records this dependency ms a justification which relates the respective nodes. The RMS thus keeps track of what data are believed and disbelieved, and why, given the inferences made so far.","The traditional approach, justification-based reason maintenance, JTMS (Doyle 1979), is to maintain a (global) belief by associating with each node a status of in (indicating belief in the corresponding datum) or out (indicating lack of belief in the datum) such that every justification is satisfied. 2 The entire set of (consistent) in data make up the cur-","1 For an excellent introduction to reason maintenance, see Reinfrank (1989).","2I prefer the term \"reason maintenance\" but use the standard abbreviations \"ATMS\" and \"JTMS\" (where \"T\" stands for \"truth\" ). 1 287 rent"]},{"title":"context","paragraphs":["(belief, interpretation3). In case of a contradiction, dependency-directed backtracking is invoked to identify the inconsistent assumptions and enable retraction of some of them.","A more recent approach is assumption-based reason maintenance, ATMS (de Kleer 1986), which supports problem solving in multiple contexts simultaneously .... there is no need to keep the over-all database consistent as in the JTMS. Thus, the ATMS is oriented towards finding all solutions, whereas a JTMS is oriented towards finding only one solution. In this and other respects, an ATMS resembles chart parsing (Kay 1980, Thompson and Ritchie 1984), something which will be further dealt with below. Each ATMS node has a label with information about the minimal sets of assumptions on which it ultimately depends. Thus, rather than associating explicit"]},{"title":"in/out","paragraphs":["information with nodes, the status of a node with respect to a context can be determined by comparing the label of the node with the assumptions that underlie the context. There is no dependency-directed backtracking in an ATMS since contradictions do not pose any problem and the assumptions underlying a contradiction are directly identifiable.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review and compare various ways of adopting JTMS and ATMS techniques in parsing and interpretation. Section 4 carries on with discussing specifically how an ATMS-style system can be used in various applications of incremental parsing and interpretation, and, finally, section 5 smnmarizes the conclusions."]},{"title":"2 3TMS-Style Approaches","paragraphs":["2.1 Overview An early example of adopting reason maintenance in parsing (more precisely, story analysis) is the system RESUND (O'Rorke 1983). O'Rorke considers the problem of correcting inferences 4 that conflict with subsequent information in the story. He combines the story processor with a JTMS, using dependency-directed backtracking to determine incompatible assumptions, and a collection of preference heuristics to choose from among candidate solutions. 5","3Sense-semantic interpretation; possibly also contextual interpretation.","4 An inference here corresponds to a selection (assumption) of a schema, a script-like knowledge structure used for deriv-ing information not explicitly mentioned in the text.","~Other work, ttmugh not adopting downright JTMSs, makes use of somewhat similar techniques for the purpose of recovering from erroneous inferences. For example, Jacobs (1988), in dealing with the problem of \"concretion\" -- developing a most specific or metaphorical interpretation -- lets his system, TRUMP, treat each interpretation as an assumption. If an assumed interpretation results in a contradiction, dependencies are used to discard (chains of) assumptions that conflict with the preferred interpretation.

The DCG is extended with default rules to enable nonmonotonic reasoning. These defaults are used to guide the entire parsing and interpretation process.

The purpose of the JTMS is to obtain a system which avoids (chronological) backtracking and instead handles inconsistent information (ambiguities) by choosing to believe a different portion of the previous inferences.

Zernik and Brown 1988:802), the system initially assumes \"the child\" to be the agent since the \"default voice\" is considered to be \"active\".

Unfortunately, in a domain like natural-language analysis where local ambiguity constantly plagues the parser with inconsistent information, this becomes problematic. First of all, when the set of assumptions admits multiple solutions, these cannot be compared: since a JTMS only allows one context, there is simply no way to examine two sets of beliefs simultaneously in order to gauge their relative strengths.","Furthermore, upon each incremental change (i.e., parsing of a new word), new JTMS labellings have more insistent on consistency than a JTMS. Story processors like ARTHUR (Granger 1980), FAUSTUS (Norvig 1983), and ATLAST (Eiselt 1987) keep track of successive (candidate) inferences and reconsider rejected ones when faced with conflicting information. It could finally be mentioned that in the postscript to his book, Mellish (1985:114) suggests a combination of chart parsing and JTMS, but does not further develop tiffs. 288 2 to be comlmted tbr the network.

For example, if a word has two senses, only one of them will be worked on by the parser. But all that is known in such a ca,se is that both senses cannot be part of the same final solution; it may still be important to draw int~rences Dora them independently. For further discussion of these and other problems in connection with JTMSs, see de Kleer (1986:138 ft.)."]},{"title":"3 ATMS-Style Approaches 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["Charniak and Gohlman (1988) make use of an NI)MS for keeping track of alternatives arising in sense-semantic and co,ltexl;ual interpretation, for example, wil.h respect to word sense, case, and noun-phrase reference. Each alIernative is treated as an ATMS assun~l)tion and is fnr~hermore assigned a pro/mbility. By comparing segs of assumpl.ioi~s underlying various potential interpreta.lions, the system can choose the \"best\" alternative, i.e., the one with the highest probability.","Nagao (1989) provides an approach where ditferent assumptions about sentence interpretations constitute different \"worlds\" of formulae in a way which resembles an ATMS representation. A characteristic of these fra.meworks is that they only handle semantic-interpretation alternatiw',s and do not (at-tempt to) integrate this with parsing.","A different kind of Ni'MS--style approach, and one that is grounded in parsing, can be obtained by extending a chart parser with dependencies; more specifically, by recording for each edge its immediate and ultimate source edges (Wirdn 1989). The next section develops this.","6IncidentMly, the sole explicit example provkted by Zernik and Brown (eited above) ouly involves one default rule. Since the original as well as the revised interpretation represent coherent, sets of justified beliefs, both c~m be arrived at by straightforward (re)labelling, titus avoiding the more cumbm~ some process of dependency-directed backtracking -- in fact, ~ernik and Brown do not mention dependency-directed backtracking at all. They also do no| state any systematic preference policy, so it is not clear how they generally gauge the relative strengths of incompa/.ible assumptions when trying to resolve contradictions. 3.2 An ATMS-Style Chart Parser tIow can a chart parser extended with edge depen-. dencies be viewed as consisting of an inference engine alld a (simplified) ATMS? This section develops an infonnal answer to this question.","'llb begin with, an ATMS, just like a chart parser, can be seen as a tool for organizing efficient search through a space of alternatives by providing a \"cache\" of partial results and by sharing these results across different branches of the search space. Both the (I);-usic) A'I?MS and a chart parser are inonotonic in the sense of only providing monotonic derivability (and, in case of the ATMS, monotonic justifications). Both frameworks are incremental, performing piecemeal updates in response to a constant stream of new assumptions, nodes, and justifications. Furfller-more, the order in which updates are made does not affect tile final outcome of the process. In particular, the following correspondences hold: ® A chart edge corresponds to an NI'MS 7~ode.",". A preterminal (lexical) edge corresponds to an assumption node)'","® The immediate source information of an edge corresponds t.o a justification.","* Information about the set (of sets) of ultimate source edges of an edge corresponds to its ATMS label. . The chart corresponds to an ATMS network.",". An analysis (or interpretation) of a phr~e, sentence, etc. corresponds to an ATMS context, i.e., the theory of an environment, where the latter is a set of assumptions.","® The (standard) chart-parsing algorithm corresponds to the inference engine. More precisely, information about so,tee edges (i.e., justifications) can be derived as follows: An edge formed through a combination depends on the active--inactive edge pair that generated it. An edge formed through a prediction depends on the (one) edge that triggered it. (Alternatively, predicted edges can be left out of the dependency trails altogether: since they only represent inferential hypotheses and do not carry any analysis structure, they could be seen ~s belonging with the inference engine rather than with the ATMS. On this view, a prediction has neither dependants nor sources, s) A scanned edge does not depend upon any other","7Thus, each word sense corresponds to an assumption. In a system whidl haaldles noisy input (e.g., ill-formed or spoken input), one might instead let hypothesized word forms correspond to assmnptions.","8This would also soNe the. problenl with top-down parsing pointed out in Wirdn (1989:245 f.). --- Note that, if we want to introduce gm'bage collect.ion of useless predictions, it would still be necessary to Imep a record of their dependencies. 3 289 edge (but on an instance of a word or a lexicalized phrase).","Labels are likely to be simple in an ATMS-style chart parser. Normally, each edge has a unique, stable set of sources ~- zero, one, or two edges which are determined once and for all when the edge is created) A potential exception to this uniqueness of source is the case of the parser attempting to regenerate an (existing) edge, something which is prohibited by a redundancy test. This attempted regeneration actually corresponds to introducing an additional justification for the edge. Allowing this would require a more elaborate machinery for computing ATMS labellings in accordance with de Kleer (1986). Whether this capability is needed or not would have to be decided with respect to the demands of the particular application of the ATMS-style parser (of. section 4).","It could finally be noted that a chart parser, ~s normally conceived of, does not record \"nogoods\" (inconsistent combinations of assumptions) aus does the ATMS. Instead, the chart parser by itself ensures that inconsistent combinations of edges do not get further worked on (through predictions, the agenda, etc.)."]},{"title":"4 Applications","paragraphs":["4.1 Incremental Parsing and Interpretation A strong definition of incremental parsing would require that text can be added or deleted in a piecemeal fashion and, furthermore, that the system be-haves monotonically in processing such updates; i.e., as words are added/deleted, the set of possible analyses increases/decreases monotonically. An attractive property which follows from this is that the amount of processing of an update is roughly proportional to the size of the update (eft Wirdn 19.89:2,i2, Earley and Caizergues 1.972:1040). An ordinary chart parser as well as an ATMS-style chart parser as put forward above are incremental in this sense, whereas the nonlnonotonic model of Zernik attd Brown (1988) attd, say, an ATN parser are not. In the latter frameworks, a previously determined analysis can be modified by a subsequent step in the parsing process, t°","As for interpretation with respect to a model or a context, in order for a system to be incremental in the above sense, it should be compositional (and again monotonic) such that the interpretation","9In bidirectionM chart paa'sing (Satta and Stock 1989) an edge might have three solwces. l°One might ask which granunatical formalisms enable incremental processing. Cai, egorial gratmnoa- in its various incantations is an obvious alternative (for example, Ades and Steedman 1982). Unification-based grammar formalisms (Shieber 1986) provide another alternative given that the ratification component is capable of incremental processing (Bresnml and Kaplan 1982:xliv ft., Stee~:hnan 1985). of a phrase is a flmction of the interpretations of its syntactic constituents and their associated contexts. One computationally-oriented model which flflfils this requirement, and which is indeed taylored for incremental interpretation, is that of Haddock (1987, 1988, 199(I). Haddock's model, which can be seen as a continuation and refinement of Mellish (1985), incrementally interprets singular nounphrases which refer to known contextual entities. Translated into a chart-parsing framework, upon scanning a word, the corresponding set of predicates and potential referents (obtained from the context) is associated with the new edge, and upon combin-ing edges, a constraint-satisfaction algorithm is run to narrow down the set of possible referents.","The possibility of using dependencies also to incrementally handle deletions of words (assumptions) is investigated in Wirdn (1989). Actually, a machinery is developed to handle arbitrary sgutactic changes , which can be thought of as edit operations (insertion, deletion, replacement), and which can be fl'eely combined and applied to arbitrary portions of the text -- for example, input can be entered in any order. Edge dependencies are used to propagate the effects of a change precisely to those edges that are affected by the change. II This has potential computational applications in interactive na.turaldanguage systems such as language-sensitive text editing. In psycholinguistic terms, an edit operation might correspond to correction of a misread or misheard passage.","Since IIaddock's model for incremental interpretation is not in any way limited to left-to-right incrementality, it is possible to adopt it also within the system of Wir~;.n (1989). Furthermore, it is possible to conceive of a semantic analogue to this processing of syntactic changes. Consider a dynamic context, for example a database representing the realtime state of some world. By maintaining dependencies between entities and relations in the contextual model and their counterparts in the linguistic analysis, a machinery for incrementally reevaluating previously made interpretations with respect to the changing context could be attained. 4.2 Comparison of Interpretations The chart allows comparison of (competing) interpretations ill the sense that any analyses can be simultaneously examined. WhaZ one cannot do in ordinary chart parsing is to ~k which particular edges (assumptions, etc.) underlie a given analysis since edges are not labelled with justifications or assumptions (and all information from lower-level edges may not have been percolated upwards). Put differently, the chart cannot \"explain\" its analyses. Of course, extending a chart parser to record dependencies is a simple thing. The point is that, in doing so, one has in effect obtained a simple KI'MS-style problem 11 This could also be achieved in a JTMS-style parser. 290 4 solver. Charniak and Goldman (1988) provide an example of how ATMS techniques could be used for comparisons (eft section a.1)."]},{"title":"4.3","paragraphs":["Revision of Interpretations The basic ATMS does not provide nonmonotonic justifications and hence no machinery for actually revising a previously held interpretation through default reasoning, etc. (Similar effects are instead achieved by maintaining multil)le contexts and by switching between these.)

']~hus, although nonmonotonic devices destroy the strong notion of incrementality discussed above (the effects of an update cannot hr general be kept local, the amount of compntation needed is not bounded by the size of the update, etc.), they are sometimes needed. A recent example of this is Pollack and Pereira (1988) who use a strict compositional semantics but. with nonmonotonic interpretation rules; other examples are Asher (1984), Dunin-Keplicz (1984), and Appelt and Konolige (1988).","Dre,~sler (1989) shows how to extend the basic ArMS with a new type of node which, in particular, allows the encoding of nonmonotonic justifications and default rules. Given the relationship between chart parsing and ATMS, it seems like there should be a way of translating such a default machinery to an ATMS-style parsing framework. Furthermore, given a framework which integrates parsing and interpretation by performing interpretation on-line to the parser, it might be advantageous to allow encoding of default reasoning at the level of the parser, as indeed Zernik artd Brown do, but to use it in a nmch more restricted way."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper compares JTMS- and ATMS-based approaches to adopting reason-maintenance techniques in incremental parsing (arid interpretation). A major problem with the JTMS-based approach is that it is fundamentally limited to representing one context (one hypothesized interpretation). One consequence of this is that competing interpretations cannot be compared. Another consequence is that the system is constantly forced to commit rash choices and to spend a large part of its time revising these choices when faced with couflicging information. This situation appears even worse in light of the relative inefficiency of JTMSs. Zernik arm Brown (1988) in a sen,m take this approach to its extreme, using de~ fault reasoning and dependency-directed backtracking to guide the entire parsing and interpretation process. It is however not clear why one would want to confine oneself to a single hypothesi,; at each step of this process, lp\" [t is also not clear that default choices and dependency-directed backtracking is the best way to guide se~rch in natural-language analysis with respect to phenomena like syntactic alnbiguity. From a computational point of view, there are well-known and ell'icient teehniques, such as chart parsing, that work by developing syntactic alter,retires in parallel. Dora a psycholinguistic point of view, although the issue is under discussion, there are both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence supporting the claim thai, alternative interpretations are explored in parallel (Crain and Steedman 1985).
