The use of domain knowledge can enhance the elDctiveness of a full-text :~;ystem by providing related ~erms that can be used lo broaden, narrow, or retbcus a query at retrieval time ([Thompson and Croft 1989], [Anick et al, 1!)89] [l)ebill et al, 1988]. Likewise, domain knowledge may I,e applied at indexing time to do word sense disambiguation [Krovetz & Croft, 19891 or content analy- ~;is [Jacobs, 1989]. Unfortunately, for many domains, ~mch knowledge, even in the form of a thesaurus, is either not available or is incomplete with respect to the vocabulary of the texts indexed.","The tradition in both AI and Library Science has been to hand-craft domain knowledge., but the curb:eut availability of machine-readal)le dictioimries and large text corpora presents the possibility of deriving at least some domain knowledge via automated procedures [amsler, 1980] [Maarek and Smadja, 1989] [Wilks et al, 1988]. The approach describe.d in this paper outlines one such experiment.","We start with: (1) a lexicon containing morpho- ~yntaetie information for el>proximately 20,000 con,- mon Fmglish words; (2) encodings of English morphological paradigms and a morphological analyzer capable of producing potential citation forms fi'om intlected forms; (3) a bottom-up parser for recogniz-ing sub-sentential t)hrasal constructions; and (4) a theory of lexical semantics embodying a collection of powerful semantic princilfles and their syntactic realizations.","The aim of our research is to discover what kinds of knowledge can be reliably acquired through tile use of these methods, exploiting, as they do, general linguistic knowh'.dge rather than domain knowledge. In this respect, our program is similar to Zernik's (1989) work on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories. ()tar research, however, differs in two respects: first, we employ a more expressive lexical semantics for encoding lexical knowledge; and secondly, our focus is on nominals, for both pragmatic and theoretical reasons, l'~or full-text information retrieval, information about nominals is pararnomlt, as most queries tend to be expressed as conjunctions O[\" t]O/lllS. Frolll Ollr thc'oretical perspective, we be-lieve that the c(mtribution of the lexieal semantics of nominals to the overall structure of the lexicon has been somewhat neglected (relative to that of verbs) [1)ustejovsky and"]},{"title":"Anick,","paragraphs":["1!:)88], [Pustejovsky 1989]. Indeed, whereas Zcrnik (1989) presents metonymy as a potc~d, ial obstacle to effective corpus analysis, we beliew: that the existe,ce of motivated nletonymic structures provides valuable clues for semantic analysis of nouns in a corpus.","Our current work attempts to acquire the following kinds of lexical information without domain knowledge: o Part of st;eech and morphological paradigms for","new words and new uses of old words; o Bracketing of noun compounds; o Subclass relations between nouns; o Lexical semantic categorization of nouns; o Clustering of verbs into semantic classes based","on the collections of nouns they predicate.","While such information is still inadequate for natural language \"understanding\" systems, it. vastly simplifies the task of knowledge engineering, should one desire to hand-code lexical items. Furthernlore, such information can be trot to use directly in full-text 1 7 information retrieval systems, fulfilling some of the roles typically played by thesauri and faceted classifications [Vickery, 1975]. 2 A ]~amework for Lexical Semantics The framework for lexical knowledge we will be assuming is that developed by Pustejovsky (1989), who proposes a theory of lexieal semantics which explores the internal structure of lexical items from a computational perspective. In this theory, lexical and conceptual decomposition is performed generatively. That is, rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives, we assume a fixed set of rules of composition and generative devices. Thus,"]},{"title":"just","paragraphs":["a.s a formal language is described more in terms of the productions of the grammar rather than in terms of its accompanying vocabulary, a semantic language should be defined by the rules generating the structures for expressions, rather than the vocabulary of primitives itself. For this reason, a dictionary of lexical items and the concepts they derive can be viewed a.s a generative lexicon)","Such a theory of lexical meaning specifies both a general methodology and a specific language for expressing the semantic content of lexical items in natural language. The aspect of this theory most relevant to our own concerns is a language for structuring the semantics of nominals. Pustejovsky (1989) calls this the Qualia Structure of a noun, which is essentially a structured representation similar to a verb's argu-ment structure. This structure specifies four aspects of a noun's meaning: its constituent parts; its formal structure; its purpose and function (i.e. its Telic role); and how it comes about (i.e. its Agentive role). For example, book might be represented as containing the following information:"]},{"title":"book (*x*, *y* )","paragraphs":["[Const: in:formation(*y*)] [Form: bound-pages(*x*) or disk(*x*)] [Telic : read(T,~,*y*)] [Agentive : artifact(*x*)","write (T,z,*y*)]","This permits us to use the same lexical representation in very different contexts, where the word seems to refer to different qualia of the noun's meaning. For example, the sentences in (2)-(3) refer to different aspects (or qualia) of the general meaning of book. 1: This book weighs four ounces. 2: John finished a book. 3: This is an interesting book.","Sentence (1) makes reference to the Formal role, while sentence (3) refers to the Constitutive role. Example (2), however, can refer to either the Telic or the Agentive aspects given above. The utility of such knowledge for information retrieval is readily apparent. This theory claims that noun meanings should make reference to related concepts and the relations into which they enter. The qualia structure, thus, can","IF or elaboration on this idea and how it applies to various lexical classes, see Pustejovsky (forthcoming). be viewed as a kind of generic template for structuring this knowledge.","To further illustrate how objects cluster according to these dimensions, we will briefly consider three object types: (1) containers (of information), e.g. book, tape, record; (2) instruments, e.g. gun, /Jammer, paintbrush; and (3) figure-ground objects, e.g. door, room, fireplace. Because of how their qualia structures differ, these classes appear in vastly different grammatical contexts.","As with containers in general, information containers permit metonymic extensions between the container and the material contained within it. Colloca-tions such as those in (4) through (7) indicate that this metonymy is gramrnaticalized through specific and systematic head-PP constructions. 4: read a book 5: read a story in a book 6: read a tape 7: read the informatioz~ on ghe tape","Instruments, on the other hand, display classic agent-instrument causative alternations, such as those in (8) through (ll). 8: ... smash the wse with the hammer 9: The hammer smashed the wtse. 10: ... kill him with a g~m 11: The gun killed him.","Finally, figure-ground nominals permit perspective shifts such ms those in (12) through (15). 2 12: John painted the door. 13: John walked through the door. 14: John is scrubbing the fireplace. 15: The smoke filled the fireplace.","That is, paint and scrub are actions on physical objects while walk through and fill are processes in spaces. These collocational patterns, we argue, are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of the noun, and we term such sets of collocated phrases collocational systems, a","To make this point clearer, let us consider a specific example of a collocational system.

By relating these two predicates temporally we can generate the arbitrary transition events for this opposition.

On the one hand, the projective conclusion space, with its structured assembly of terms, clusterd about a nominal entity, can serve as a \"virtual script\", capable of homonym disambiguation ([Krovetz 1990], [Cullingford and Pazzani 1984]) and query reformulation. On the other hand, the qualia structure cal)tures the in-herent polysemy of many nouns. In the latter respect, our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information science. One approach, known as \"faceted classification\" (Vickery (1975)) proceeds roughly as follows. Collect terms ly-ing within a field. Then, group the terms into facets by assigning them to categories.

Since it is our belief that such representations are generic structures across all domains, our long term goal is to develop methods ['or how these relations and values can be automatically extracted from on-line corpora. In the section that follows, we describe one such experiment which indicates that the qualia ,;tructures do, in fact, correlate with collocational systems, thereby allowing us to perform structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations.","3 A Knowledge Acquisition Procedure In this section, we outline our procedure for knowledge acquisition, implemented as part of the LINKS Lexicon/Corpus Management System. r Steps are illustrated with examples drawn from an analysis done on a Digital Equipnlent Corporation on-line corpus of 3000 articles containing VMS troubleshooting information.

Attempt semantic classification into a known lexical category. Try to match the set of syntactic constructions within which X appears with one of our diagnostic construction sets. This may involve searching for the set of constructions that contain nouns in other argu-ment positions of the original set of constructions. For example, the set of expressions in-volving the word \"tape\" in the context of its use as a secondary storage device suggests that it fits the container artifact schema of the qualia structure, with \"information\" and \"file\" as its containees: (a) read information from tape (b) write file to tape (c) read information on tape (d) read tape (e) write tape","7. Use heuristics to cluster predicates that relate to the Telic quale of the noun. For example, the word \"tape\" is the object of 34 verbs in our corpus: (require use unload replace mount restore time request control position dismount allocate off initialize satisfy contain create encounter get allow try leave be load read write have cause protect up perform enforce copy) Among these verbs are some that refer to the formal quale: mount, dismount and some which refer to tape in its function ,as an information container: read, write, and copy. One of the ways to tease these sets apart is to take advantage of the linguistic rule that allows a container to be referred to in place of the contaiuce, i.e. the container can be used metonymically. The verbs which have \"information\" (previously identified as a likely \"containee\" for tape) as an object in the corpus are: (check include display enter compare list find get extract set be write fit contain read recreate update return provide specify see open publish give insert have copy take relay lose gather) When we intersect the verb sets for \"information\" and \"tape\", we get a set that reflects the predicates appropriate to the telic role of tape, a container of information (plus several empty verbs): (copy have read contain write be get) Thus, the metonymy between container and containee allows us to use set intersection to discriminate among predicates referring to the telic vs. formal roles of the container. What results from this acquisition procedure is a kind of minimal faceted analysis for the noun tape, as illustrated below. tape ( *x*, *y*) [Const : information(*y*), file(*y*)] [Form: mount (w,*x*), dismount (w,*x*)] [Telic: read(T,z,*y*), write(T,z,*y*),","copy (T, z,*y*)] [Agent : artifact (*x*)] To illustrate this procedure on another semantic category, consider the term \"mouse\" in its computer artifact sense. In our corpus, it appears in the object position of the verb \"use\" in a \"use-to\" construction, as well as the object of tile preposition \"with\" following a transitive verb and its object: (a) use the mouse to set breakpoints (b) use the mouse anywhere (c) move a window with the mouse (d) click on it with tile mouse ... These constructions are symptomatic of its role as an instrument; and the VP complement of \"to\" as well as the VP dominating the \"with\" PP's identify the telic predicates for the noun. Other verbs, for which \"mouse\" appears as a direct object are currently defaulted into the for-real role, resulting in an entry for \"mouse\" as follows: mouse(*x*) [Cont : button(*x*)] [Form: move(w,*x*), click(w,*x*)~ hold(w, *x*)] [Telic: set(*x*,breakpoint), move (*x*, window), click-on (*x* ,window)] [Agent: inst (*x*)] Thus, by bringing together the automatic construction of collocational systems with a notion of qualia structure for nouns, we have arrived at a fairly useful lexical representation for Information Retrieval tasks."]},{"title":"4 Discussion","paragraphs":["Previous investigators involved in corpus analysis using weak methods have documented limited successes and warned of many pitfalls (e.g. [Grishman el al 1986] and [Zernik 1989]). The approach described here differs from previous efforts in its combination of diagnostic collocational systems with a generic target representation for nouns. While our limited experiments with the acquisition algorithm show some promise, it is too early to tell how well this approach will do in a larger corpus containing a greater range of senses for terms. One danger is for the algorithm to be overly optimistic in matching a set of occurrences to a diagnosis. Given the rampant ambiguity of preposi-tions and the potential for verb object combinations that, can spuriously suggest metonymic I0 4 relationships, we have found the algorithm as it stands to be too susceptible to jumping to false conclusions. We are looking to improve precision by increasing our repertoire of both positive and negative diagnostics, as well as by incorl)orat-ing information theoretic statistics (as in Church and ttindle (1990)). Likewise, we have been investigating ways to reduce misses - cases in which evidence of relationships between terms known to be related is not detected by our current set, of heuristics. One case in point regards our analysis of \"disk\", which we initially expected to behaw~' similar to \"tape\" in its telic quale, ttowever, the intersection of predicate sets for \"disk\" and \"information\" yielded the terms (copy s;pecify set be have) Missing are \"read and \"write\", the relic predicates for tape.
