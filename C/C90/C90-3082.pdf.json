The central module of this architecture is a planning component, which allows to plan single sentences as an answer to a KB query. The planner works for three different languages (English, French and German) and for sentence generators based on two different grammar formalisms (ucG for English and French, Lr'G for German) independent of the particular grammar or grammar formalism. It uses several knowledge sources of the ACORD system to make its decisions. The output of the planner is used for the language specific generators as well as for the update of information needed for pronoun resolution. 1 Introduction 'I~he ACOI~D prototype offers an interactive update and query of a knowledge-base (Kn). In the query situation the user asks the KB using natural language and possibly graphical pointing. The final response composed of natural language and also if appropriate, graphical highlighting, is generated with a language specific generator, in the three ACORD languages (English, French and German) using the same grammar formalisms and grammars employed in parsing: ucc for English and French, and LFG for German. The generators are fully described in [9] for the UCG framework, and in [3] and [5] for the LFG framework. The objective of this paper is to describe the modules common to the three languages, which build the semantics of the answer to be generated using the semantics of the question posed to the system, the dialogue history, and the KB answer. 2 The Semantic Representation )dost components in the ACORD system share a semantic representation language called [nL"]},{"title":"(Indexed Language","paragraphs":["(see [8])).

Canonicity means that only those InL formulas are treated, which could be produced by the parser, but not all formulas, which are logically equivalent 1. In the context of InL, the notion of canonicity cannot be for-malized outside the grammar definition. We then needed a semantic language where canonicity could always be provided, even though an expression was produced with-out any grammar dependent information. Second, the generator needs NP planning to control the generation of referring expressions (see [6]). In order to specify information about the type of NP to be generated, a representation is required which allows the encoding of syntactic information in addition to semantic information. Furthermore, the individual bits of semantics must be related to the syntactic structure. More generally speaking, we need a mechanism for modifying or structuring the semantic representation to be generated prior to generation. Standard InL, being a purely semantic representation language, is inadequate for encoding this syntactic information. Third, and most importantly, all of this has to be achieved in a language-, grammar- and formalism-independent way 2. 3 Designing SynInL 3.1 State of the art There is a main difficulty in the concept of planning-based generation systems which explains the monolithic nature of many systems described in the relevant literature. If a planner plans a particular type of syntactic structure in the absence of grammatical intbrmation, there is no guarantee that the structure specified will actually be accepted by the grammar as being well-formed. There are basicMly two solutions to this problem. One is to simply assume that the planner only specifies structures from which it will be always possible to generate. This works perfectly when there are no interactions between structures specified locally. An example of a grammar formalism with this \"locality\" property is the context free languages. However, for most modern approaches to grammar (including Government and Binding theory (GB) and all unification-based grammar formalisms), the locality property does not hold. In this case, we have to assume that the grammar is \"loose enough\" that anything we might plan can in fact be generated despite any interactions. Such a planning could","1To determine whether two syntactically distinct InL expressions are logically equivalent under laws such as commutativity and associativity is factorial in complexity.","2Language independence must be viewed as language independence regarding French, English and German."]},{"title":"388","paragraphs":["be done deterministically. Itowever, using ~his al,proach such a planner would always run the risk that it would fail to geuerMe due to inconsistencies with the grammar. ']'he second solution is to interle~rve planning and gener ation and allow the possibility that failure to generMe, results in different planning choices. Snch systems also exist, although they seem to be comparatively recent in the literature. We (lid not investigate this possibility since it requires a fairly tight integration of planner and (grammar and formalism specific) generator which scems inconsistent with our requirement th~tt we generate with three languages and two grammar formalisms. 3.2 Description of our aI)I)roach Our solution is to attempt an independent level of syntactic representation which abstracts away from the peculiarities of the surface syntactic structures of particular languages and deals directly with syntactic notions which are language~indcpendcnt. Whether one thinks that this is possible, depends to a large degree on one's particular theoretical perspective. What might sucl, an \"abstract\" syntactic representation look like'.\" There are several related concepls in diterse linguistic theories which salisfy the criteria. The most directly related concept is lhat of l)-struelure in (~1~. l)-strncture is a lew~l of syntactic struct.ure which mirrors semantic funcl.or-argun~e~lt strnctnre directly (via the 0.-eril.erion and lhe l)rojeclion Principle) and which is also relaled io surface syntactic structure 1)y the rule of M,,,,e-a, a lransformation that nloves COll- !:liluenls fronl oue position Io anolher, l~elaled IlOiiOlls of sirltctnl'o which Captllre the relation belwc(,n Selllal/- l ic funtl.or-argllillellt slrncture (or predicate-arglmlent sirueture) and \"abstract\" or \"deep\" syntactic sirnclnre are tile f-s|rllcl/Ircs of LI.'C, and the. grammalical funclion hierarchy-based accounls of subcategorisalion in ltPSG and t'CG.

As mentioned above, this is most similar to D-structure i, cm t]mory. ~:;ynlnL expresses both syntactic and semantic inibrma-I ion. Idealizing considerably, SynlnL formulas consist of four types: heads, complements, modifiers and specifiers. This corresponds directly to the stamtard constituent types in","theory.

Heads are of the general form:","head(Semantics, /trgList, hdjunc'tList) That is, they specify their own head semantics and a lisI of arguments and adjuncts which are also either specifier or head structures. All of these struclures also allow the encoding of syntactic requirements on arguments and adjnncts. IIowever, there is no indication of either surface syntactic order of the complements and adjuncts or of the relative scope of quantitiers occurring in either complements or modifiers. Tile language generators are free to realize both scope and surface syntactic structure in any way which is consistent with the SynlnL specification. ttow is this augmented representation built ? The parsers produce nnresolved lnL. This InL contains enm~gh syntactic infm'mation for a uniqne mapping into an equivalent SynlnL expression. This mapping is done by the InL -~ SynlnL module. C, iven av Inl, expression, it distinguishes between struclural and prime predicales. For prime predicates there is ahva.ys a real)ping into a SynlnI, formula with a unique category. The structural predicates then determine how to merge the Synlnl, formnlas which replace the origil!:d parlial InL expfession. 4 The Phmning Component 'Fhe role of the planning component is to produce SynInL expressions from which phrases can be generated by lhe langnage specilic generators and lo decide whether any objects on the screen have to be highlighled. \\Vithin ACOIlD, the planner gets as input lhe Synlnb expression corresponding to the user question (yes/no rifles - tion, wh-queslion or 'how mnch'/'how many'-question) and the KB answer, q'he planner output consists of an optional canned texl marker and the Synl. L of the answer Io be generated. The planner uses three snb-planners i'or planning verb phrases, NPs and modificalions. 4.1 Architecture of the generator The answer process consists of the following steps:","e The question is parsed. The output is the InL representa.tion of the question with informalion for resol, tion.","* This InL expressiof is transformed into SynlnL by the Ill l, --~ SynlnL module a.nd also resoh, cd using the occurrence inh)rmation by the resolver. The resolver provides the generator with information which encodes the user's qnestion as vnderstood by Ihe system.","® The resolved lnL is passed on to tile KB which provides the KB answer.",", The planner module takes as input the SynlnL expression of the query and the KB answer. Depending on the. type of questions asked, the planner makes decisions such as: what kind of canned text prefix is needed, what type of NP planning is necessary, what ldnd of answer is expected and what type of processing ca.n be done on lids answer. It calls the NP sub-planner in order to process all the NPs appearing i~ the queslion, as well as the [~I~ answer which is trans[brmed into an appropriate Syn[n L cx pression (generally an N 1'). 'l'he ou [pHt"]},{"title":"389","paragraphs":["of the planner is a SynlnL representation of the answer.","• The SynInL answer is the input to the language specific generator of the current language. The selected generator produces the final answer. 4,2 Planning the Structure of Verb Phrases Within the ACOIID lexicon, verbal predicates may only take arguments which refer to objects. This means that we do not do any planning for arguments which denote events or states, i.e., verbal or sentential complements. Consequently we only distinguish between two types of predicates: the copula, which only takes a subject and a noun phrase or PPS as complement, and all other verbs. Other active verb forms take either one, two, or three arguments. The first argument always corresponds to the subject (in an active clause), the second to the object or a prepositional complement, and the third to the second object or a prepositional complement. Given ~ list of arguments, the verb planner calls the NP planner on each argument, providing information relative to the function of the argument position under scrutiny, its posilion in the argument list, and the subject of the sentence in which the argument occurs. ']?he list of modifications of the original query (if any) is processed last. For each element of this list a call to the modification sub-planner is made. 4.a Planning Noun Phrases The planning component is responsible for providing the best expression for Nes. It nses the dialogue history as well as I,:B knowledge to decide whether to adopt a pronominalization strategy, or find a non-pronominal description for the NP under analysis. The NP planner must be provided with enough information to decide whether and which kind of pronominalization is allowed, and whether a name coukl be used instead of a pronoun where such an option is available. It mnst also decide when to use demonstratives, definite or indefinite articles, and whether a complex description shonh[ include relative clauses and adjuncts. In addition, our planner has to decide which objects should be highlighted on the screen. 'l~o do so, the NP planner needs a fully specified discourse referent and information about the syntactic environ-ment of the NP to be produced. The output of the NP planner is a fully specitied SynInL expression, a possible extension of the list of objects to highlight on the screen, a possible extension of the list of local antecedents, and a possible change of the information corresponding to the answer in the event that the NP planner has produced the NP for the answer. 4.4 Planning modifications Modiftcations appear either in the context of a verb or in the context of an NP. They express negation, Pps, relative clauses, adjectives and adverbs. The modification planner is currently handling relatives and PPS. In the case of a relative clause, the identifier of the object of the verb is set to the NP discourse referent, and the verb planner is called. In case of a Pp with exactly one argument, if this argument is in the focus of a wh-question, the I,:B answer has to give both the internM name and the new argument of the preposition. If the answer is no, the planner fails, since we currently don't have a semantic definition for the various Pp negations like 'nowhere' or 'never'. The overall result is then the canned text I don't know. Otherwise there is in generM a list of adjunct-argument pairs. For each pair a Y';ynInl, expression for the preposition is generated, calling the planner recursively on the argument (pronominalization is not allowed in the context of a PP). If there is more than one pair in the list, a pP coordination is initialized and reduced as will be explained below. Coordinated PPS are allowed to appear in a.nswers. A list of SyninL expressions for l'ps can be reduced, if the same preposition is used more than once, and the prepositional arguments are not demonstrative pronouns. The result-ing ,CjynfnL expression contains the common preposition, and art NP coordination corresponding to the arguments of the tbrmer SynInf, expressions. The NP coordination then can also be reduced as described in [4]. 5 Conclusion Generation in ACORD demonstrates how planning can be done for several languages with a minimum of language-specific information. The basis of our approach is the concept of SynInL which encodes language-independent syntactic information in addition to semantic information. A SynlnL expression can be deriwtted from an InL expression using a deterministic process. Language-specific dependencies are still necessary concerning gender and the syntactic function of NPs. q'hey could be reduced further by adopting a slightly different architecture concerning the interelation of the generator and the resolver.","References","[1] Kamp, H.
