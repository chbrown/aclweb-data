For instance, we can take one member of such a relation to be the spelling of an inflected form, another member to be the corret~ponding lemma, another to be a string representing its morphosyntactic features, another to represent its pronunciation, and so forth.","Inspired by the (unpublished) work of Kaplan and Kay (ongoing since the late 1970's), and that of Koskenniemi in [12], many researchers have used binary word relations to represent \"underlying\" and \"surface\" forms in the morphophonology of words. Much of the interest of this work has been focused on methods to combine multiple two-tape automata, which may be composed or run in parallel in order to compute the desired binary relation.","In this paper, we take a somewhat different approach to defining and computing word relations, and discuss its application in a morphological processot for Spanish orthographic words that covers more than forty millions forms generable from the approximately 55,000 basic words in the Collins Spanish Dictionary ([3]) 1. The main advantage of this approach is the extreme simplicity both of its data structures and of their interpretation. As a result, an interpreter is easy to implement; time and/or space op-= timization issues in the implementation are straight.. forward to define; at the same time, it is extremely easy to compile traditional morphological information into the required form, at least for languages like Spanish that can be fairly well modeled in terms of the concatenation of steins and affixes. As is usl~.lly the case in automata-based approaches, the system treats analysis and generation symmetrically, and tile same description can be run with equal facility in either direction.","Define 2 an n-ary nondeterminisiic finite automaton as a 5-tuple A = (Q,qt,F,E,H) where Q is a finite non-empty set of states, ql is a designated start state, F is a set of designated final states, E is a finite non-empty alphabet, and H is a finite subset of {Q × (E*)\" × Q}, where (:E*) n is the set of n-tuples of (possibly empty) words over E..,4 can be thought of as a labeled directed graph, whose nodes are elements of Q, and whose edges are elements of H, each such edge being labeled with the appropriate n-tuple of words. The component-wise concatenation of labels along every path that begins in ql and ends in an element of F defines a set of n-tuples, R C (E*) n, which is the relation accepted by A.","As a practical matter, we generally want to run a program that (explicitly or implicitly) searches this graph in order to find all the n-tuples in R with some interesting property, say those corresponding","1 The present set can be increased almost exponentially by adding new derivatlonal affixes.","~The name and the basic idea of these automata come from [5]. For simplicity of exposition we gloss over various authors' attempts to distinguish variously among machines, automata and transducer#, as well as the profusion of precursors mad de-scendants in ([15], [16], [2], [7], etc.). Our notation is edeetlc. 1 277 to forms whose surface spelling is the string w, or those corresponding to the first person plural imperfect subjunctive of such-and-such a verb. Depending on the structure of H and the property selected, the search will be harder or easier. For the stem-and-affix kind of morphology exemplified by Spanish, the natural structure for H is quite easy to search. We do not have space to discuss search methods here, but will simply observe that a non-optimal method devised for convenience in another experiment ([6]) processes several hundred Spanish words per second on a Sun4.","For the application discussed in this paper, we want to relate inflected forms, lemmas, and morphosyntactic features, so that the elements of R should be 3-tuples like:"]},{"title":"( eambiaran, eambiar, 3rd plural per fect subjunctive).","paragraphs":["Since most Spanish words consist of a stem, which mainly specifies the lemma, and a set of affixes that mainly specify the morphosyntactic features, it is appropriate to use 2-tuples made by concatenating the second and third elements.","The basis of our run-time system is the arc list H. For a large lexicon, it is inconvenient to write this list by hand, and so we compile it from a lexical table that reflects more directly the way that morphological information is represented in a standard dictionary, such as the Collins dictionary we began with. The program interprets recursively all the possible arcs of the lists. Therefore, more than one analyzed or generated form is given. For instance, the analysis for the input word \"retirada\" is of the form: retiral\" pas~ participle feminine singular retirado adjective feminine singular retirada noun feminine singular"]},{"title":"2 The arc-list compiler","paragraphs":["The arc-list compiler starts with a list of lexical items with their morphological classes, applying morphophonological transformations to generate the arc list. For instance, each verb headword in the Collins dictionary is given an index that specifies one of 62 conjugation classes. Based on this information, the arc-list compiler calculates the set of stem allomorphs necessary for that verb's inflection, along with the set of endings that each stem allomorph selects. Spanish verbs have from one to five orthographic stem allomorphs. When the verb is regular there is only one stem, like \"cambi-\" in \"cambiar\" (to change). An irregular verb may have up to five stems, like \"ten-\", \"teng-\", \"tien-\", \"tend- \", \"tnv-\" for the verb \"tener\" (to have). This is common in Romance languages (see Tzoukermann 1986 for French). These different stems are the result of morphophonological changes occuring during the verbal flexion, usually related to the stress implications of the verbal ending or to the features of its initial vowel.","Depending on the conjugation class, the character string corresponding to the verb lemma is subjected to one or more rewriting rules. These rewriting rules are of different types:","* they can be the consequence of a stress change during the verbal flexion: (a) e -- ie when the last syllable is not stressed like in quoter / qulero.","* they can be a morphographic change that is general to Spanish orthography: (b) c - qu before \"e\" and \"i\" like in sacar / saque. or the reverse rule (c) qu - c before \"a\", \"o\", \"u\" like in delinquir / delinco.","Some verbs are subject to one type of rewriting rule such as in (a) - (c) above, and consequently produce one additional stein allomorph. The verb \"sacar\" (to take / pull out) will generate \"sac-\" and \"saqu-\", as well as \"delinqnir\" (to offend) with \"delinqu-\" and \"delinc-\".","Some other verbs, less frequent in number' but more frequent in actual use, are subject to two rewriting rules and need a more complex treatment. In \"forzar\" (to force), tile morphophonological rule combines with the othographic one and produces a distribution of four steins, such as \"forz-\", \"fore- \", \"fuerc-', \"fuerz-\". The same phenomenon occurs for \"rogar\" (to beg) with the stems \"rog-\", \"rogu-\", \"rues-\", \"ruegu-\". For some verbs of the second group in \"-er\", the stem production is less predictable; for instance \"tenet\" presents five sterns \"ten-\", \"teng-\", \"tien-\", \"tend-\", \"tuv-'. Notice that some of them such as \"tens-\" do not follow the type of morphophonological rules mentioned above.","Because of Spanish orthographic conventions connected with the notation of stress, some nouns and adjectives also acquire more than one stein allomorph in a rule-governed way. In addition, of course, there must be a list of cases where the allomorphy is simply unique to the word in question."]},{"title":"3 The arc list","paragraphs":["Using a state labeled 1 by convention as the start state, and a state labeled 0 by convention as the (unique) final state, we express all of the information needed to define our automaton .4 by enumerating the arcs in H, which now can be represented as lists of 4-tuples"]},{"title":"(qi,qj,u,v),","paragraphs":["where qi and qj are arbitrary identifiers for states, u is a substring of an inflected form, and v is a substring of the corresponding lemma + morphosyntactic category. 278 2","{Jsed either tbr analysis or for generation, our pro-. gram interprets this same arc list. The arc list can be conceptually divided in two parts: one contains the stems of the verbs, nouns and adjectives; the other contains a number of sub-lexicons that provide the endings for these lexical categories as well as the clitics°","Our Spanish system is defined by a set of about 58,000 such 4-tuples, (most of which are) gener~ ated by rule from head words and category information extracted from the typographer's tape for the Collin:~ Spanish Dictionary. Affixes, assorted null-string transitions and tittles account for about 1000 elements of this set; the remainder are stems or stem allomorphs. Since we have about 55,000 laminas, the overhead for compiling out predictable aspects of allomorphy is at worst the approximately 2,500 stem allolnorphs and affix arcs, i.e. less than 5%. There are about 225 states in total."]},{"title":"3.1. :Verbal stems","paragraphs":["The verbal stem lexicon was obtained by extracting tile verb headwords (about 6,800 Spanish verbs) from the Collins dictionary.","Once the grammar provides the stems, a state pair is associated to them.

Other arguments in favor of this choice of representation are given in section 4.1.","For the 62 conjugation classes, grouped in three verb conjugations, the number of stems combined with the various ending distributions creates a number of verb-stem-final states close to 150.","Defective verbs, due to their idiosyncrasies, are listed separately°"]},{"title":"3.2 The adjective stems","paragraphs":["The adjective base tbrms (about 10,500) were de-rived fl'om the masculine singular Ibrms listed in the dictionary.

For instance, an intermediary state was added for the tenses only.

Consequently, there are as many nodes of that kind as tenses for each group and verb category. 3 279 4.2 Endings A series of sublexicons lists the inflections for the verbs, nouns and adjectives. Verbal inflections are of the form: 150 500 o Ist singular present indicative 150 500 as 2nd singular present indicative In the same way, the regular endings for the adjectives are of the form: 300 497 o adjective 497 498 # masculine 497 500 # singular 498 500 s plural Each transition corresponds to the gender or number feature of the adjective."]},{"title":"4.3 Clitics","paragraphs":["The eleven Spanish clities can occur either alone or in combination ([1]). Over sixty-five combinations can be formed such as \"seles\", \"noslas\", etc. The in-finitive, gerund and imperative are the only forms in which they can occur, for instance, \"hacerlo\" (to do it) or \"dici6ndooslo\" (saying it to you). Nevertheless, they are sometimes subject to orthographic rules of the type: deletion of \"s\" for first person plural imperative verbs in front of the enclitic \"nos\", such as in \"anlanlonos '~ .","Consequently, about 300 arcs were listed to handle the general cases as well as the idiosyncrasies. 4.4 Reflexive verbs In the case of reflexive verbs such as \"aflliarse\" (to afiliate, to join) or \"abstenerse\" (to abstain, to refrain), a special treatment is motivated. Such verbs have a paradigm like:","(a) me afilio, (I afiliate) te afilias, (you afiliate) me afiliaba, (I .as afiliating) te a~liabas, (you were afiliating)","(b) afiliandome (afiliating myself) afiliatet (afilla~e!) The reflexive pronouns generally precede the verb form, separated from it by white space ms shown in (a), except for the infinitive, imperative and present participle (example (b) above) a. For the preced-ing reflexive pronouns, there is a dependency between the person-and-number of the pronoun and the person-and-number of the verbal ending, spanning the intervening verb stem. To capture such de-pendencies in a single automaton of the kind that","3Note that some verbs (e.g. \"afillaxse\") occur only reflexively, while other (e.g. \"lavar\" (to wash, to clean)) may be used reflexively or non reflexively. Note also that object pronouns in general are cliticized, note only the reflexive ones. we are using, we would have to use a separate path for each person-number combination, duplicating the verb stem (and its allomorphs, if any) six times. This seems like a bad idea. A better alternative, in such cases, is to set up the automaton to permit all reflexive pronouns to co-occur with all endings, and to filter the resulting set of tuples to remove the ones that do not match. This can be done, for example, by passing the output through a second automaton that does nothing but check person and number agreement in reflexive verbs.","We find it interesting that precisely those aspects of Spanish morphology that require such a treatment are those whose formatives are written as separate words. 4.5 Prefixes and suffixes About 60 suffixes and 90 prefixes were added to the arc list for handling derivational morphology. Only tile very productive ones were selected. The prefixes are of the form \"nero-\", \"ante-\", \"auto-\", \"bio-\" occurring with or without the dash; the suffixes are of the form \"-ejo\", \"-eta\", \"-zuela\", \"-uelo\", etc.","The resulting arc list, in addition to supporting an efficient computation of relations between surface and lexical forms, provides a good overview of the morphological structure of the Spanish verbal, system, permitting easy access to the sets of verbs that behave in a similar way."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have implemented a complete morphological processor for Spanish, one which generates and recognizes all (and only) well-formed inflected and de-rived forms. It covers about 95 % of Spanish text extracted from the EFE newswire text coming from Madrid. It has been linked to a browser for the Spanish newswire and to the Collins bilingual dictionary (see Appendix), is also being utilized in the construc-tion of a Spanish parser (Donald ttindleat Bell Laboratories) and for further research in Spanish text analysis. We have found this model to be both simple and powerful. We plan to implement other Romance languages, and to experiment with German, where the treatment of compounds presents some special interest."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Casajuana R. and C.
