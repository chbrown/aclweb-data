The Lambek categorial grammar is one representative of the grammar family under consideration. It allows for a restricted use of hypothetical reasoning. We define a modification of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CKY) parsing algorithm which covers this additional deductive power and analyze its time complexity."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Categorial grammars have become attractive in the last decade. One reason might be the rediscovery of their conceptual elegance: the combinetory potential of a lexeme is stated in direct association with the lexeme itself- in the lexicon. A basic (bidirectional) categorial grammar B is defined by a set of categories C := C0U{zl ~ = x/Y or z =x\\y; x, yC C} (C0 a finite set of basic categories, the category y is referred to as the argument category, the category x is called value category, complex categories are named functor categories), a goal category g (the start symbol) which is a basic category, a lexicon L which is a function from a finite set of lexemes onto a set of finite sets of categories, and the two combination rules \"leftward application\" (app\\) and \"rightward application\" (app/) which state how argument positions are filled:","(app\\) y, xky ~ x","An object U --* x where U is a sequence of categories is called a sequent.","This basic concept of categorial grammar may be extended by adding more combinatory rules. E.g. the rule of functional composition is the incarna-tion of the idea how to handle certain phenomena of unbounded dependencies: if a funetor category x/y finds only an incomplete argument category y/z, i.e. which, itself, still lacks an argument z, then these two partial categories can be, nevertheless, combined into the category x/z, which expresses the fact that z is still missing.","In general, functional composition cannot do its job by itself. One needs rules which allow for changing the order in which a functor category takes its left arguments with regard to its right arguments. The use of the type raising rules is one way to obtain this goal:","(tr\\) y-~ x\\(x/y)"]},{"title":"(tr/) y xl( \\y)","paragraphs":["The first extensive use of the concept of functional composition in syntax appears in the paper lAdes, Steedman 1982]. The rules of functional coinposition and type raising have already been mentioned in [Lambek 1958] as being theorems of the Lambek calculus.","To obtain a Lambek categorial grammar L from a basic categorial grammar, one has to add the two rules of functional abstraction (T is a non-empty sequence of categories):",":/Y' T --+ x"]},{"title":"(ab tr\\)","paragraphs":["--~ x\\y","(abstr/) T, y --~ x","T--~ x/y The rule (abstr\\) reads: If x can be derived from the category sequence 7' under the assumption that y has been put in front of T then it holds that x\\y is derivable from T alone. An example of an L-derivation in a somewhat abbreviated notation 1 is given in figure 22. This analysis is an adaptation of ideas due to [Hepple 1990a].","In the remainder of the paper, we first give a brief overview on other approaches to parsing with extended categorial grammars. Then the modified CKY-algorithm is presented."]},{"title":"2 General Processing Issues","paragraphs":["in connection with parsers for extended categorial grammars, the problem of \"spurious ambiguities\" or derivational equivalence has appeared in a massive way: One syntactic (or semantic) reading of a sentence can be derived in many, many ways. There have been several proposals in tile literature how to tackle this problem.

In the Lambek calculus, the problem of spurious ambiguities disappears since one can define a normal form for derivations which can be carried out on the fly (cf. [Hepple 1990b], [KSnig 1989]). One essential characteristic of this normal form is the following: If there is a choice between using an application rule and an abstraction rule, the abstraction rule is preferred. Another requirement is that no spontaneous uses of the abstraction rules do occur (cf. Prawitz normal form, [Prawitz 1965]). This means that an abstraction rule can only be triggered by lexical material."]},{"title":"3 A chart parser for extended categorial grammar","paragraphs":["The CKY-algorithm ([Aho, Ullman 1972]) works bottom.-up.

Although the current algorithm has an undesirable time complexity in its gener~d case, one carl define restricted versions which cover tile kind of structures found in linguistic examples with time complexity O(n 3) or O(n 4) depending on the. fact 3 235 whether one wishes to describe single or double extraction from phrases. It is an interesting question whether better Mgorithms for the general case can be found.","There are many ways to improve this new algorithm concerning its \"average complexity\" in practical applications. For example, the search for a part-ner item in a completer-step could be reduced by using appropriate heuristics. Further incre~es in efficiency can be expected, if one allows for arbitrary embedding of disjunctions and slashes in categories (of. [Benthem 19891, [Morrill 1989]) instead of using the flat set notation which amounts to a disjunctive normal form of categories in the lexicon.","Theoretical complexity results for a group of categorial grammars reaching beyond context-free languages are known, as well. From the fact that certain extended versions of categorial grammars (CCG) are equivalent with the Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) ([Weir, Josh[ 19881), the O(n 4 log n)- time complexity of TAG-parsers ([tIarbusch 1989]), in principle, carries over to CCG.","The connection of the propositional grammar calculi as discussed above with a unification device for first order germs is done by taking care of the variable bindings in the hypothetical categories which are asserted by the abstraction rules. The recognition problem is still decidable (cf. [Pareschi 1988]) although surely not wellbehaved as this is the case for all non-propositional grammars. For example, the recognition problem for a. basic categorial grammar witti feature unification is NP-complete ([Morrill 1988]). Higher order versions of categorial grammars like the ones being produced in the CUG/UCG-frameworks ([Uszkoreit 1986],[Zeevat et at. 1986]) where variables can range over categories are in general undecidable because higher order unification itself is undecidable."]},{"title":"5 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The research reported in this paper is supported by the LILOG project, and a doctoral fellowship, both from IBM Deutschland OmbH, and by the Esprit Basic Research Action Project 3175 (DYANA).
