The proposed method is based on a constraint propagation mech,'ufism which reduces the number of unnecessary structures built at parse thne through the early detection of inadmissible local trees. The propagation of constraints is rendered efficient by indexing constraints and categories in a connection graph m~d by using a bidirectional chat1 pm~er together with a botlore-up strategy centered around head constituents. ;[o Introduction","Among currant syntactic theories, Generalized l'hrase Structure Grammars (GPSG) [4] provide an appealing solution for describing natural languages with their modular system of composite categories, rules, constraints and feature propagation principles. As other highly modular systems, GPSG is plagued by the difficulty of desigtfing an efficient algorithm lor combining its various components into an executable program. Recent attempts to solve this problem have followed different lines of research.","One solution [9] rests on die almost equivalence between GPSG and Context-Free Grmnmars (CF). In this framework, GPSG rifles, met~mdes and constraints on weU-fonned categories and local trees am transforumd before any parsing took place into an equivalent set of CF produclions for which various efficient pro'sing methods already exist. In theory, lhis method has the advantage of preserving the hice expressive properties of GPSG while leading to a parsable grammar. Though, the method is clearly hnpractical in the case of real grammars due to the enormous nmnber of categories and local trees which must be considered prior to the filtering by the other modules.","A related yet more realistic method [9] follows the same strategy of compiling GPSG into an-other grammar description language for which there exist parsing algorithms. In this case, the target language [6] has a CF skeleton but is augmented through feature descriptions which provide a natural mapping from GPSG categories. Here the difficulty lies for the linguist in tile expression of the grammar in the target language since there exist no algorithm to compile automatically the GPSG grammar.","Another set of approaches [1,7,8] attempt to build fronl scratch a parsing strategy wlfich is suited to GPSG or rather to a modified version of it. The modifications are (sometimes) motivated by linguis.. tic arguments, e.g. enhancing the expressive power, but first to render GPSG computationaly tractable at the expense of some of its distinctive features.","The last class of methods [2,12] try to take GPSG as it is and to design a parsing algorithin wtfich is not only sound but 'also complete with re-. spect to the theory. Then the difficulty lies in the efficiency of the parser. The method described in this paper belongs to tiffs category. Several principles contribute to its efficiency. First, it is based on a bidirectional chart parser, Which, together with the ad.. vantages of conventional chart parsing, is well suited to both the ID/LP decomposition and the palficuhu: role devoted to head constituants. Second, the various constraints used in GPSG (linear precedence, head feature convention, foot teature principle) are viewed as a set of constr,'dnts which are applied as soon as possible, when necessary, to shorten the development of unproductive hypotheses. Third, the constraints are precompiled into a connection graph which mini~ mizes the computation of category subsumption done at run time. And, fourth, the rule invocation strategy is bottom-up ,and head-driven in that the only ele-1 151. mentmry active edges created bottom-up in the chart are those corresponding to head constituants. This strategy allows the FFP and the HFC to be brought into use at the time active edges am created and, consequently, by instantiating very soon a maximum of the foot anti head features of dominating categories, to detect violations of constraints long before constituents are completed. 2. Bidirectional chart parsing","Conventional chart parsing techniques [5] avoid redoing identical parses tot grammars having a context free basis. In the case of GPSG, these ted> tuques could be straightforwardly customized to accommodate ID rules. This would result in a strategy where an active edge would be created for each category in a rule extending a given inactive edge, be it a head daughter or not.","When one considers the go~ of having uninteresting patzes fail as soon as possible, it becomes imo portant to Make head daughters come into play first. \"Iqais is because they activate a maximum of constraints on their mother categories by the percolation of features through the t~TC and FI-q:'. In order to build local ID trees around their head daughters, the strategy should not force the first constituent attached to an edge to be its lefiruost one. We use bidirectional chart parsing [11] because it relaxes Otis constraint. This technique has been first proposed in the context of speech recognition where isl~md parsing is made advantageous because lexical interpreta.. tions are weighed by plausibility factors. Its proponents remarked that it could also be well suited to linguistic theories sharing the notion of head constituent, like GPSG. This intuition was confimaed by the comparison we made on several chm~ parsing strategies (see section 6 \"hnplementation\").","In order to fit the ID/LP decomposition, each edge of the bidirectional chart must have the following structure : Start : End : Rule : Match : Category : Daughters : the leftmost position of the edge; the rightmost position; a pointer to the associated ID ale; a bit vector indicating those members in the LHS of Rule with an extension attached to the edge; the category of the edge; the list of daughter categories.","Thus an edge is active just in case all bits of Match are set to 1.","New edges are created in two mtmners. Some are formed when an inactive edge is an extension of a head category in an ID rule (rule 1). They have only one daughter category and we call them"]},{"title":"elementary edges. The","paragraphs":["others stem from the extension (in the chart sense) of an active edge (rule 2). An active edge A is extended on its right (resp, on its left) any time an inactive edge adjacent on the right (resp, on the left) has a category wtfich is an extension of a category in the Rule of A whose bit in Match is not set to 0. To be validated the new edge should not vio~ late any FCR, LP, I-Pb'C or F~ constraint (see beo low). 3. ']lle connection graph","The categories of edges result (1) from the application of feature instantiation principles to ,an aclive edge or (2) from the creation of an elementary edge.","Thus the category of a new edge is always an extension of the category of an already existing edge (I) or of the category in the left-hand side (LHS) of an ID ale (2). Since the whole process is initialized by extending lexical inactive edges, the only categories possible for non-lexical edges are extensions of ale LHSs. In addition, LP mid FCR constraints only concern categories being al extension of respeclively both categories in a LP statement or the ~efl calego.. ry in a FCR constraint. It is then possible to remark that the constraints that should be verified on a cate~ gory A are inherited fi'om the constraints to be veritied on the category B category A stems t}om. This is because for A to be an extension of a category C it is necessary that B may be unified with C.","In the sane way, inactive edges of category A may only become daughters in local trees whose associated ID rule features a category B in their LHS such that A is an extension of B. Thus determining the ID ales by which elemeutary edges cnuld be creo ated under the application of rule 1 to an inactive edge may be seen as inheriting these ID rules from the categories of edges leading to it by the recursive application of rule 2 (extension). These Iwo processes, inheriting constraints and ID ales, should be related to the inheritance of colmections in a conneclion graph theorem prover [10].","In a commction graph theorem prover (CGTP), resolvents may be only resolved in turn with axioms connected to one of their parents, just like in GPSG categories may be constrained only by constraints concerning ttmir mother category, that is the category they am an extension of. Importing the technique of connection graphs in GPSG allows to reduce the 152 2 amount of computation needed to verify constraints. Just like in CGTP, a preprocessing phase, done once for all and independently of any phrase to be parsed, connects every categories in rule right-hand sides (RHS), LPs, FCRs and FSDs to the relevant elements of rule LHSs. Thus each LP C 1 < C 2 (resp. FCR t C 1 ~ C 2) is connected to all categories C such as C unifies with C 1 or C unifies with C 2 (resp. such as C unifies with C1). In the case of FCR, categories C such as C does not unify with C 2 are never created since they violtate the FCR.","In the same way, FSDs are connected to categories to help determine where they should apply. For example, if we consider the ID rule N 1 ---> H, PIP and the LP constraint [+N] < PP plus trees N 1 [SUBCAT 30] PP[+POS] paper of Gazdar we see that the LP must be checked on this pair of trees because the following connections between the involved categories exist:","unifies unifies N 1 -< - [+N] < PP ~ PP","extends I /nnifies unifies~ extends f (inherited) (inherited) -\" N I[SUBCAT 30] PP[+POS]","On this diagram, two connections have been inherited from former ones.","In order to distinguish the types of constraints connected to categories, several arcs are present in the graph. For exmnple, FCR-Left type arcs connect a category C with a FCR C 1 ~ C 2 such as C unifies with C 1.","Inheritance of constraints in the connection graph and creation of bidirectional edges in the chart thus make the bulk of the parsing method. The method is then completely defined through the ways of :","• applying ID rules, constraints and feature instantiation principles to create new edges and categories;","t We assume all FCRs to be in the canonical form C l :~ C 2 since the other formats (e.g. C 1 = C a) may be decomposed into a set of canonical forms (e.g. {C 1 ~ C 2, C 2 ~ C l }).","• inheriting connections to ID rules and constraints for each new edge and category; • computing the initial connection graph. 4. Applying ID rules, constraints, and feature instantiation principles","We assume that, in a first step, ,all metarules have been applied when possible to base ID roles to generate an extended set of ID rules t?. Thus we are left we a set of ID nlles, LP and FCR constraints, and feature instantiation principles, included FSDs. 4.1. Immediate Dominance Rules","As remarked in section 3 above, a daughter category in an edge of the chart must be either the category of a lexical item or an extension of an ID rule LHS. Thus, provided that the connection graph was suitably initialized, it is sufficient to consider only those members in ID role RHSs connected to a lexical item or to an inactive edge in order to create new edges through rules 1 and 2. 4.2. Linear Precedence Constraints","LP statements ,are checked each time an edge is considered for extension through rule 2. These checks only occur when a new edge A results from B being extended on its left (resp. right) by category C. Then, only those LP, C 1 < C a such as C is connected to C 2 (resp. CI) and C 1 (resp. Ca) is connected to some daughter of B are considered. For the selected LPs, the parser has then to compare C 1 and C 2 on one hand and C and daughters of B on the other hand with respect to the partial order relation is-an-extension-of. 4.3. Feature Co-occurrence Restrictions","It is not necessary to wait for an edge to become inactive before checking FCRs. In fact, it is far better to consider them each time a new edge is created. A being the category of the new edge, tiffs requires to check each FCR C! ~ C 2 cotmected to tile edge in tile graph through the extension and unification relations. 4.4. Feature lnstantiation Principles In order to be able to check LP ,and FCR con-","tt A better method for applying metarules should trigger them only when needed by the sentence to be parsed. The indexing of constraints in a connection graph could serve this purpose. 3 153 straints as soon as possible on new edges, the trans° mission of features though general instantiation principles (HFC and FFP) is done each time rule 2 is applied. Head and foot features of the extending edge A are compared to those of the extended edge B. There are two cases :","o m least one of these features gets inconsistent values on rite daughter A and its potentied father B; in this situation, edge A is not valid and the chart is not modified;","o all foot and head features get consistent valre;s; then those which were unspecified or underspecified are set to the suitable value fl~rough unification; the category of the new edge is added to the comiection graph where it inherits the relevant ID rules, LP, FCR and FSD, 4.5. Feature Specification Defaults","Since feature specification defaults only affect features not set by the feature instantiation pfinci~ ples they only apply to inactive edges. Thus their use consists in applying otfly those FSD connected in the graph to the catego~7 of a new inactive edge. 5o hfitiMizing the Connection Graph","qhe connection graph is initialized in two phases. A first phase may took place only once for every grammar since it is independent from the particular phrase to be parsed. In this phase, all possible connections between ID rules categories, LPs, FCI~s and FSDs are computed. For example, each conneco lion between a rule LHS A and a rule RHS element B such that A ratifies with B are memoriz~ed,","The second phase depends on the lexical interpretations of the phrase to be parsed and it adds new connections to the graph. \"lhese co~mections are those that hold between a lexical interpretation A and a category B in the RHS of a rule such that A is ,'u~ extension of B. 6. hnplementation \"Ille method has been implemented as a Como mon Lisp program on a pVAX-II. A core GPSG grannnar of French was developed using this parser. In order to assess the interest of the bidirectional chart and its head-driven bottom-up strategy we made a series of tests consisting in parsing a small set of French sentences under three different strategies : strategy I was left-to-right and top-down, strategy 1I was left-to-right and bottom-up, and strategy Iii, the chosen one, is bidirectional, bottom-up ,and head-driven.

Conclusion","The method we propose makes it possible to parse efficiently GPSG grammars but unlike other apo proaches [1,3,7,8] it allows the grammar to be ex.. pressed in the exact formalism described by Gazdar arid his colleagues in [4] and does not require an in-tractable preprocessing ptiase like would do e..g. thc compilation of the grmnmar into an equivalent set of context-free productions.","Although we did not study in detail the suit-. ability of the method when the control agreement principle is taken into account, we do not see any major incompatibility with the use of a connection graph to index the various modules of a GPSG gram~ Knar 8.
