The study of this problem shed light not only on the efficiency and soundness of generation algorithms, but also on the descriptive appropriateness of grammar itself.","A generation algorithm based ou the Early's method has proposed, which is capable of analyzing and generating sentences in a uniform architecture [Shi88]. In this architecture the criterion of\"semantic monotonicity\" is assumed to reduce fruitless generation. As Shieber has mentioned, this method is still inefficient and limited, and ,instead, has shown an efficient and general top-down generation algorithm using the semantic-head concept 1 [Shi89].","An algorithm for Categorial Unification Grammar(C.UG) is mentioned in [Ca189]. As to the important ~:ole of lexicon, this grammar shares the same property as principle-based grammars, but difthrs in that CUG has grammar rules in the lexicon(This enables top-down generation with prediction as discussed in [Shi89]). The identity semantic problem and the lexical indexing problem are some of the same problem noted in principle-based grammars.","Generation based on Lexical Functional Grammar(LFG) is formalized in [Wed88].

Bottom-up generation also has the possibility of incorporating this information. This issue will be discussed later.","I propose a bottom-up generation algorithm for principle-based grammars, which makes use of the same grammar as a parser. Bottom-up generation is inefficient due to a high degree of nondeterminism. It is limited by its inability to process se,nantic expressions created by grammar rules. It also has an identity semantic problem. This paper describes the solution to these problems and the issues concerning implementation of the algorithm using a constraint logic programming language, cu-PROLOG.","First, the problems of bottom-up generation are shown. Next the generation algorithm using constraint propagation and solutions to these problems are considered. Third, some issues concerning implementation and an example of this algorithm are mentioned. Finally, the problem of logical form equivalence, lexical indexing, and controlled search using the discourse information are discussed."]},{"title":"2 Problems of Principle-based Grammar Generation","paragraphs":["Principle-based grammars like tlead-driven Phrase Structure Grammar(HPSG) or Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar(JPSG) seem to be inadequate for top-down operations. The reasons for this are; (1) as principle-based grammars have few skeleton rules, top-down operations that are assumed to use rules are not adequate for them, (2) much information is in lexical items instead of grammar rules in principle-based gramm~Lrs, and (3) the construction of semantic expressions is intuitively adequate for bottom-up operations ~. Therefore, an efficient bottom-up generator for principle-based grammars must be developed.","Bottom-up generation has two advantages; it can use lexical information at an early phase, and can bottom-up strategy. But generation is fundamentMly driven in a","2U:aification can be used for bl-dlrectional operations. However, if you need destructive semantic operations('destructive' means that a resultant semantic expressions cannot be constructed from base semantic expressions without these special functions), unificatlon cannot be used for these operations. 1 188 avoid the left recursion because of the property similar to bottom-up parsing, tIowever, bottom-up generation has three problems[Shi88,89][Ca189]; (1) inefficiency because of a high degree of nondeterminism, (2) limitation which is caused by inability to process semantic expressions created by grammar rules, and (3) vestigial[Shi88], or identity semantic problem[Ca189] (hereafter called identity semantic problem). (2) and (3) relate to completeness and coherence problems[Wed88].","Inefficiency because of a high degree of nondeterminism means that a naive bottom-up generation algorithm cannot use semantic information properly, and many semantic-irrelevant subexpressioas that are syntactically correct will result.","One of the reasons that Shieber adopted a top-down strategy is that he insisted on the existence of logical tbrms produced by gramnmr rules. This as-sumpti0n means that sub-semantic expressions cannot be derived from resultant semantic ones that are different from normal ones. It is shown later that if we permit this kind of destructive semantic opera-tion, we cannot obtain an efficient algorithm.","An identity semantic problem is common among generation algorithms using lexical-based grammars. The semantic expressions are classified into substantial eh'ments that contribute to the whole semantic expres.~ions, and functional elements(these are identity semantic expressions) without influencing the whole ones. Examples of tile functional elements are complementisers in English, or case-marking postposition ~n 3apanese. Simply speaking, the solution is to introduce these items at some time, but this also produces high inefficiency."]},{"title":"3 Principle-based Grammar Generation","paragraphs":["pendent of data, it does not incur such a problem.","Hasida has shown that sentence analysis and synthesis can be described following a simple program with a constraint, constitttent 3 struct( Category,X,Y); constituent(Category,X,Y).

Constraint propagation techniques are very effective in these problems[Din86]. Constraint propagation techniques are classified into two methodologies: active constraiut, which transforms constraints into more efficient ones, and passive constraint, which is realized by the function such as freeze in Metalog.

That is, Daughter.sem and Head.sere cannot be predicted from Mother.sere. To get the value of Daughter.sere or Head.sere from Mother.sere, the inverse function f-1 is needed. The implicit assumption of in-versability of the function[Shi89] is very severe, and a rather tricky feature structure must be constructed to escape the completeness problem. Therefore, it seems better to use another function in a semantic-monotonous framework instead of this one.","However, we can easily modify the predicate predict to get another head using the semantic information to which the function is applied, if this inverse function is obtained. 3.2.3 An Identity Semantic Problem When using constraints to access fuuctlonal lexical items, an exhaustive search is not required. The insertion of Non-null constituents, such as case markers and fnnctional nouns, can be restricted using various constraints (syntactic, semantic information). For example, case markers that indicate the relationships between verbs and nouns are demanded by subcategori~ation information of the verbs. By using the constraint solving techniques, efficiency can be improved equal to or more than that of the top-down algorithm. Of Course since such occurrences(e.g, mdl constituents, or gap) cannot be restrained, this convenient mechanism cannot be used. However, this situation is the same as top-down algorithms."]},{"title":"4 Implementation 4.1 Grammar FormaUsm and Implementation Language","paragraphs":["Our algorithm exploits JPSG as phrase structure grammar formalism.

The distinctive feature of this language is its simplicity of the form for discourse processing.

This problem concerns generation algorithms which are sensitive to logical forms. Namely, if an input semantic expression is converted by meaning postulates, different expressions with the same meaning are produced by different procedures.This problem occurs in the generation of expressions that have quantificational ambiguities.","A conversion using meaning postulates does not need syntactic or semantic information, but needs discourse information. Since generation strategies such as [Shi89], [Ca189] as well as ours use syntactic and semantic information, it is reasonable not to consider those operations. However, algorithms must have enough extendibility to reflect discourse inforn'tation. 5.2 Lexical Indexing Strategy Searching lexical items is very important for efficient algorithms. Metaknowledge about semantic expressions is necessary for this purpose, especially in the case of complex ones[Cal89].","This problem is not peculiar to generation. For example, discourse processing in which various inferences are executed by using the semantic expressions has the same problem. To cope with this problem, [Hob85] has proposed more simple logical forms. I also consider this a good idea for generation.","5.3 Controlling Search Using Discourse Information Many sentences corresponding to one meaning can be generated by our algorithm(or other algorithms). Idealistically all sentences are distinctively produced according to other information such ~s discourse information. Our algorithm has the possibility for easily realizing this mechanism.","Suppose that an information uni~ agrees with a predicate in the semantic information. Control of the element position is realized by solving the constraint of the older information in turn r. Passivisation in Japanese is achieved by controlling the insertion of functional elements.","Transformational Grammar(the antecedent of Parameter and Principle theory) indicates the interesting piece of data that have many sentences with the same meaning. This concerns the position of the elements and the introduction of functional elements. As mentioned above, our algorithm is capable of refleeting discourse information on surface structures because of constraints.","~This assumption is problematic because correspondence is not guaranteed and if r~ semantic element is uniquely mapped to a lexical entry, the position is directly designated by the order of the semantic elements. 5 192","The algorithm proposed in [Wed88] can generate sentences that reflect discourse phenomena such as topicalization in LFG, but the formalization of topic greatly helps to simplify the algorithm."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper an efficient bottom-up generation algorithm for principle-based grammars using constraint propagation is proposed, and a solution to bottom-up generation problems is mentioned.
