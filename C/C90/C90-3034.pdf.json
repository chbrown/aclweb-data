The first demand is for good academic practice. The second is to ask for an algorithm that generates all and only the possible scopings of a sentence. The third demand is for an algorithm that avoids appealing to the syntax of logical form in order to determine possible scopings. I present a modified version of [Hobbs and Shieber 1987], which simplifies its operation, and can be considered sound and complete, depending on what interpretations of English sentences are deemed possible. Finally, any doubts concerning the use of logical form syntax are avoided."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["[Hobbs and Shieber 1987] presented an algorithm to generate quantifier scopings from a representation of \"predicate-argument relations and the relations of grammatical subordination\" (pg 49).

The algorithm is claimed to be more successful than previous accounts in dealing with complex noun phrases such as \"every representative of a company\" and in coping with certain 'opaque' predicates such as negation. 1 Two properties of an algorithm which Hobbs and Shieber (H&S) approve of are completeness and soundness. An algorithm with these properties might be used as a benchmark for other algorithms designed for efficiency or the use of heuristics governing the plausibility of the various interpretations. Unfortunately, demonstrat-ing that H&S's algorithm is sound requires a semantics for the input language and the intermediate forms. That is not straightforward. I present a modified algorithm which avoids such intermediate forms. The input to the algorithm consists of English syntax. The steps of the algorithm retrace steps through a truth definition for the input language. Clearly, the algorithm is sound and complete with respect to that. The algorithm is also sound and complete with respect to English, if you agree that the input 1They acknowledge [Keller 1986] as a similar solution"]},{"title":"190","paragraphs":["language fairly represents the actual language of English speakers. Furthermore, the algorithm is somewhat simpler than H&S's algorithm and makes no appeal to logical syntax.

Truth is defined as satisfaction by the null assignment, N.

The reason for this is simply that an ambiguous sentence such as 1) is true in either of two conditions.

The result of application is a new four part quantifier expression whose first two parts are q and x, whose third part is the result of recursing on r(x) and whose fourth part is the result of recursing on p(x) (the formula itself with the complex term replaced by the variable it restricts).

Quantifiers chosen earlier receive wider scope. We work our way through the formula outside-in. [Woods 1968] explained the advantages of a top-down treatment of quantified noun phrases. 191 The basic operation of H&S is similar. An application builds a four part term whose first two parts are q and x, whose third part is r(x) and whose fourth part is the formula with x replacing <q x r(x)>). The result is then recursed upon in order to deal with other complex terms in the formula. Now consider complex noun phrases such as \"every representative of a company\". These are success cases for H&S. The new algorithm deals with them without alteration.

The issue is whether quantifiers can be extracted across conjunctions.

It also contains a free variable. H&S therefore forbid the algorithm to apply complex terms which are embedded within other complex terms. Also, the restrictions of complex terms are recursively scoped with a flag set so that this call of the procedure returns partial results (still containing complex terms), as well as full results."]},{"title":"4 Negation","paragraphs":["There are two readings of the sentence 4. Everyone isn't here depending on whether \"not\" or \"every\" takes wider scope. In ordinary logic we have","\"not(p)\" is true iff it is not the case that \"p\" is true Suppose C is an environment containing an occurrence of \"not\", then","g satisfies C(..not..) if it is not the case that g satisfies C( .... ) Here the formula on the right-hand-side is just that on the left, with the occurrence of \"not\" removed. The ambiguity in 4) arises in exactly the same manner as quantifier scope ambiguities. Using one rule (negation) before another (quantification) leads to wider scope for the first application. In contrast, H&S analyse 4 syntactically as not(here(<every x person(x)>)) and mark \"not\" as being opaque in its only argument. The rule for opaque arguments allows them to be scoped first thus giving H&S the narrow scope \"every\" reading. 192 This use of the terrn \"opaque\" is somewhat nonstandard since \"not\" is not usually considered to be opaque."]},{"title":"5 Pronouns","paragraphs":["Introduchlg complex noun phrase led to increased complexity in the H&S algorithm. The introduction of structure such as 5. Every man saw a plcture of himself where \"him\" is bound by \"every man\" leads to yet more. Take the representation of 5. as 6. saw(<,,very x man(x)>,<a y picture(y,x)>) Applying <every x man(x)> first, via the H&S mechanism, gives (every x man(x) saw(x,<a y picture(y,z)>)) Application of <a y picture(y,x)> would now lead to \"x\" being free. H&S prevent this by stipulating that a complex term is applicable only if all free variables in the term are also free in the containing formula. [Pereira 1989] calls this 'The Free; Variable Constraint' and complains of an appeal to logical syntax. Our own methodology avoids this. First, note that 6) is supposed l;o be a purely syntactic structure. The occurrence of \"x\" in \"picture(y,x)\" represents the pronoun \"himself\", and the fact that \"x\" also occurs in \"<every x man(x)>\" represents the grammatical relation holding be-f~ween \"<every x man(x)>\" and \"himselP'. Coindexing is used here just to indicate certain grammatical relations. ~ Tile following notation is clearer.","saw( <every x man(x)>, <a y picture(y,himself-x)> ) Now, we alter our quantification rule so that if C is an environment containing <q x r(x)>, our new term is constructed from \"q\", \"x\", and recursions on \"r(x)\" and C where <q x r(z)> and all embedded coindexed reflexives are replaced by \"x\". ~;uppose vce choose to apply","~This is one area where H&S'e analysis is d]fflcult to follow - wh~t is the role of variables in the input and intermediate forms ? <a y picture(y,himself-x)> first to 6). Then we construct our result from \"a', \"y\" and recursions on both \"saw(<every x man(x)>,y)\" and \"picture(y,himself-x)\" ;the final recursion cannot proceed however, for we have no rule to interpret a reflexive in this position. There is no appeal to logical syntax, only English syntax. The same holds true of non-reflexives as in 7. Every man saw a friend of his where \"every man\" and \"his\" are co-indexed. 6"]},{"title":"6 Summary and Conclusion","paragraphs":["A modification to the algorithm of [Hobbs and Shieber 1987] based on a hint from standard logical theory has led to a simpler algorithm, and one which makes no illegitimate appeal to tile syntax of logical form. The algorithm is sound and complete with respect to the input language since it retraces the semantic definition of that language. The degree to which it matches our intuitions concerning English determines how good a contribution to natural language processing it is.
