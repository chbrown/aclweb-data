The problem is formulated as one of combinatorial optimization, and a polynomial order algorithm is derived. This algorithm finds an optimal phrase sequence and its dependency structure simultaneously, and is there-fore particularly suited for an interface between speech recognition and various language processing. What the algorithm does is numerical optimization rather than symbolic operation unlike conventional parsers. A parallel and layered structure to implement the algorithm is also presented, Although the language taken up here is Japanese, the algorithm can be extended to cover a wider :family of languages. 1. Introduction","In Japanese language processing related to speech recognition and word processing, we often encounter a problem of selecting a phrase :sequence which constitutes the most acceptable sentence from a phrase lattice, that is, a set of phrases with various starting and ending positions, By solving this problem, linguistic ambiguities and/or uncertainties coming from the inaccuracy in speech :recognition are expected to be resolved.","This problem can be solved, in principle, by enumerating all the possible combinations of the phrases and measuring the syntactic and semantic acceptability of each phrase sequence as a sentence. Obviously, however, the amount of computation in this enumerative method grows exponentially with respect to the length of the sequence and becomes in-tractable even for a moderate problem size.","In this paper we formulate this task as a combinatorial optimization problem and derive a set of recurrence equations, which leads to an algorithm of polynomial order in time and space. We utilize the idea of dependency grammar [Hays 64] for defining the acceptability of a phrase sequence as a Japanese sentence.","With a review of recent theoretical development on this topic, a parallel and layered implementation of the algorithm is presented. 2. Dependency Structure of Japanese","In Japanese, words and morphemes are concatenated to form a linguistic unit called 'bnnsetsu', which is referred to as simply 'phrase' here. h typical phrase consists of a content word followed by some functional morphemes, h Japanese sentence is a sequence of phrases with a structure which can be described by a diagram as in Fig. 1 [Hashimoto 463. For a sequence of phrases XlXZ...x n to be a well-formed Japanese sentence, it must have a structure satisfying the following constraints [Yoshida 72]:","(el) For any i (l<i<n-1), there exists unique j (i<j<n) such that x i modifies xj in a wide sense.","(c2) For any i,j,k,1 (l<i<j<k<l<n), it never occurs that x i modifies x k and xj"]},{"title":"modifies x I.","paragraphs":["A structure satisfying these constraints is called a dependency structure here.

X n are dependency structures and x 0 is a phrase, then <Xl...X n x0> is a dependency structure.","A dependency structure <XI...X n x0> (Xi=<...xi>) implies that each x i, which is the last phrase in X i, modifies x 0, It is easily verified that a structure satisfying the constraints (el) and (c2) is a dependency structure in the sense of Definition 1 and vice versa [Ozeki 86a3.","When a dependency structure X is composed of phrases Xl,X 2 ..... x n we say that X is a dependency structure on XlX2...x n.

Acceptability of a Dependency Structure","For a pair of phrases x 1 and x 0' we can think of a penalty imposed on a modifier-modificant relation between x 1 and x 0. This non-negative value is denoted as pen(xl;x0). The smaller value of pen(xl;x 0) represents the more natural linguistic relation. Although it is very important to establish a way of computing pen(xl;x0), we will not go into that problem in this paper. Based on the 'local' penalty, a 'global' penalty P(X) of a dependency structure X is defined recursively as follows [0zeki 86a].","Definition 2 (1) For X=<x>, P(X)=O. (2) For X=<Xl...X n xo>, where Xi=<...xi> (I<i<n) is a dependency structure,","P(X)= P(Xl)+...+P(X n)","+pen(xl;xo)+...÷pen(xn;XO).","Note that P(X) is the sum of the penalty of all the phrase pairs which are supposed to be in modifier-modificant relation in the dependency structure X. This function is invariant under permutation of X 1 ..... X n in accordance with the characteristic of Japanese. 4. Formulation of the Problem","For simplicity, let us begin with a special type of phrase lattice composed of a sequence of phrase sets BI,B 2 ..... B N as shown in Fig.2, which we call phrase matrix.

The smaller value of s(x) represents the higher reliability of x. We encounter this special type of phrase lattice in isolated phrase speech recognition. In that case B i is the set of output candidates for the ith utterance, and s(x) is the recognition score for a candidate phrase x.","For a dependency structure X on a phrase sequence XlX2...x N, the total reliability of X is defined as","S(X)= S(Xl)+...+S(XN). Combining the acceptability and the reliability, we define an objective function F(X) as","F(X)= P(X) +S(X) . B 1 B 2 • • • B N Xll x21 - XN1 x12 x22 .- _ XN2 Xl3 x23 XN3","Fig.2 Phrase matrix.

Recurrence equations and a resulting","algorithm","Combining two dependency structures X and Y=<YI ..... Ym,Y>, a new dependency structure <X,Y 1 ..... Ym,y> is obtained which is denoted as X O V. Conversely, any dependency structure Z with length greater than 1 can be decomposed as Z= X@ Y, where X is the top dependency structure in Z. Moreover, it is easily verified from the definition of the objective function that","F(Z)= F(X) ÷ F(Y) ÷ pen(x;y), where x and y are the last phrases in X and Y, respectively. The following argument is based on this fact.","We denote elements in B i as Xjl,Xi2 .....

Related Works","The problem of selecting an appropriate ?hrase sequence from a phrase lattice has been treated in the field of Japanese word ?recessing, where a non-segmented Japanese t:ext spe].led in kana character must be converted into an orthographic style spelled in kana and kanji. Several practical methods have been devised so far. Among them, the approach in [Oshima 86] is close in idea to the present one in that it utilizes the Japanese case grammar in order to disambiguate a phrase lattice. However, their method is enumeration-oriented and some kind of heuristic process is necessary to reduce the size of the phrase lattice before syntactic analysis is performed.","In order to disambiguate the result of speech recognition, an application of dependency analysis was attempted [Matsunaga 86, Matsunaga 87]. The algorithm used is a bottom-up, depth-first search, and it is reported that it takes considerable processing time. By introducing a beam search technique, computing time can be very much reduced [Nakagawa 87], but with loss of global optimality.","Perhaps tile most closely related algorithm will be (extended)CYK algorithm with probabilistic rewriting rules [Levinson 85, Ney 87, Nakagawa 87]. In spite of the difference in the initial ideas and the formulations, both approaches lead to similar bottom-up, breadth-first algorithms based on the principle of dynamic programming.","In Fig.2, if each phrase set has only one phrase, and the value of between-phrase penalty is 0 or 1, then the algorithm reduces to the conventional Japanese dependency analyzer [Hitaka 80]. Thus, the algorithm presented here is a twofold extension of the conventional Japanese dependency analyzer: the value of between-phrase penalty can take an arbitrary real number and it can analyze not only a phrase sequence but a phrase matrix and a phrase lattice in polynomial time.","We have considered a special type of dependency structure ill this paper, in which a modificant never precedes the modifier as is normally the case in Japanese. It has been shown that the algorithm can be extended to cover a more general dependency structure [Katoh 893. The fundamental algorithm presented here has been modified and extended, and utilized for speech recognition [Matsunaga 88]. 8. Concluding Remarks","In the method presented here, the linguistic data and the algorithm are completely separated. The linguistic data are condensed in the penalty function which measures the naturalness of modifier-modificant relation between two phrases. No heuristics has slipped into the algorithm. This makes the whole procedure very transparent.","The essential part of the algorithm is execution of numerical optimization rather than symbolic matching unlike conventional parsers. Therefore it can be easily implemented on an arithmetic processor such as DSP (Digital Signal Processor). The parallel"]},{"title":"5 315","paragraphs":["and layered structure will fit LSI implementation.","An obvious limitation of this method is that it takes account of only pair-wise relation between phrases. Because of this, the class of sentences which have a low penalty in the present criterion tends to be broader than the class of sentences which we normally consider acceptable. Nevertheless, this method is useful in reducing the number of candidates so that a more sophisticated linguistic analysis becomes possible within realistic computing time in a later stage.","A reasonable way of computing the penalty for a phrase pair is yet to be established. There seems to be two approaches to this problem: a deterministic approach taking syntactic and semantic relation between two phrases into consideration, and a statistical one based on the frequency of co-occufence of two phrases.
