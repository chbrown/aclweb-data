This notation is merely a convenience and should not be taken to imply that some sort of empty constituent is present. Also, for historical reasons, I will refer to the constituents 'left-over' in the gapping clause as ~rrmants, without implying that some sort of deletion has actually taken place.","The more interesting cases of gapping are those where the verb is missing along with other constituents. In these cases the @ -notation is essential to disambigu~te the intended reading.","(2) (a) Bill gave John the book and ~) (D Kathy the newspaper","(b) ?Bill gave John the book and Kathy ~) the newspaper","(c) *Bill gave John the book and i(aLhy the newspaper {?","This example also shows that, in general, 'grammaticality' or 'acceptability' is defined only relative to an intended interpretation. 1 Thus, whereas sentence/interpretation (2a.) is fine, most speakers don't get (2c) and accc.pt (2b) only when given a particular intonation, i.e. topic-focus structure.","The examples above all illustrate for'uJar'd 9ap .. ping, i.e. the gapping clause follows the non-gapping clause. The converse, backward gapping, also occurs, but the question of what determines the direction of gapping will not be addressed here. In fact, all the examples discussed inthis paper are forward gapping constructions from English and German where backward gapping is not nearly as varied and flexible as the forward variety.","1Langa.cker (1985) makes the point that accept~tbility is a judgement about the appropriateness of a pairing bel, ween a phonological form and the conceptualiz~Lt.ion it expresses, rather than some purely formal property of the phonological form per se, 341","The main reason for focusing on forward gapping at this point is that we want to consider gapping phenomena from the point of view of the cognitive processing demands they pose for the speaker/hearer. As will be discussed in section 2.2, it seems safe to make some very basic assumptions about processing in the case of forward gapping, so that its implications can be studied without the burden of wildly speculative premisses fl'om a still largely unknown domain.","Most theories to date have tried to account for gapping on the basis of purely formal aspects of syntax alone (see van Oirsouw (1987) for an overview), with the notable exception of Kuno (1976), who explicitly considers functional and perceptual aspects. Such approaches, mostly in a transformational framework, try to explain gapping as the result of some form of 'deletion under identity.' tlence these accounts are unable to consider questions such as why (2b) becomes possible only when given the appropriate focus structure (stressing"]},{"title":"Bill, the book,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Kathg, the newspaper).","paragraphs":["In these frameworks focus is considered a matter of pragmatics and simply doesn't figure in a syntax-based account.

If this view is correct then the study of processing constraints and applicable cognitive principles (e.g., of categorization) should provide us with a handle on some of the linguistics phenomena that apparently span a variety levels.","Of course nothing is won if we have to re-sort to uncertain or unjustified claims about the cognitive domain itself, or have no certainty of its relation to the linguistic problems in question.

Thus a sequence of multiple frames with shared fillers can be linguistically realized in a single, compact construction where multiple fillers are expressed only once. In the case of example (2a) above, the second, gapping clause refills the 'patient' and 'recipient' slots of the give frame, while retaining the 'agent' slot.","In non-gapping sentences a combination of word order, case marking, prepositional markers, selection restrictions, etc. is usually more than sufficient to assign fillers unambiguously to frame slots. In gapping constructions the role assignment problem becomes potentially more difficult since some of this information is lost, although in many cases the loss is marginal. Thus, in example (1) interpretation of the second clause is unproblematic since two constituents have to fill two slots, and the usual rules of constituent order in English unambiguously determine the assignment. In (2), on the other hand, there are three potential role assignments consistent with the constituent order given.","The problem, then, is to identify the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors that render certain gapping structures (and their corresponding interpretations) acceptable, while others axe ruled out (or at least made less felicitous)."]},{"title":"3 A Conjecture","paragraphs":["We can now state a tentative principle regarding the relation between the intcrI)retation of gapping constructions and their acceptability.","(5) Role Assignment Principle: A gapping construction with a specific interpretation will be acceptable only if it provides sufficient clues for the role assignment implied by that interpretation.","This principle is similar in spirit to tile R,ecoverability Constraint proposed by I[ankamer (1973), although it is far more generM as it potentially encompasses all kinds of linguistic phenomena that play a role in interpretation, not just syntax. 2","Note that (5) does not claim that in-terpretability alone will render a sentence acceptable, a To prevent the conjecture from be-","2IIankamer's principle was concerned with the recovery of 'deep structure' after having undergone deletions and movement.","3If someone used apple green as a noun phrase referring to a green apple we will in general be able to make sense of (i.e., interpret) that description while still recognizing it as ungramnlatical. ing vacuous two points have to be addressed. First, we have to show that there is a systematic repertoire of linguistic devices available for the interpretation of gapping constructions. Secondly, it must be shown that these devices systematically affect the acceptability of gapping sentences in accordance with the principle.","In many cases gapping constructions will not be strictly 'good' or 'bad', but felicitous to a certain degree, or acceptable to only some fraction of speakers. This is consistent with the principle stated above, since (5) can easily be rephrased in terms of degrees of acceptability:"]},{"title":"(6) Role Assignment Principle (graded version):","paragraphs":["A gapping construction with a specific interpretation will tend to become more acceptable as more clues for the intended role assignment are made available.","Note also that this formulation effectively characterizes interpretation of gapping constructions as an evidential cognitive phenomenon, i.e. one where multiple sources of evidence contribute to a perception or interpretation in a cumulative manner. 3.1 Syntactic clues Despite the definite non-syntactic influences on gapping, syntax (together with the rules govern-ing its relation to semantics) is the major source of information for interpretation, even when the syntactic structure is 'incomplete'. Clues such as linear order, case marking, and prepositions are still potentially available for the remnant constituents.","Van Oirsouw (1987) has recently suggested a theory in terms of constituent deletion under identity which probably covers as much ground as is possibl e in a purely syntax-oriented framework. 4 Interestingly, he was able to state some surprisingly far-reaching generalizations by ignoring all fine points of phrase structure and simply considering the top-level ordering of constituents.","In a similar fashion, it seems that for forward gapping, the following simple rule captures a considerable range of cases. It is a straightforward variant of the MinimM Distance Principle proposed by Kuno (1976).","4His generalizations can be rephrased without necessarily assuming deletion transformations. 343","(7) Principle of Surface Proximity: A remnant constituent tends to fill a role whose previous filler is close in surface constituent order.

If we assume that roles are sequentially processed and have to be retrieved when refilled, it seems natural that the retrieval tends to become more difficult as the temporal distance from the previous processing event increases.","At a more abstract level, syntagmatic proximity can be viewed as symbolizing conceptual relatedness (Langacker 1985). Hence the frame unit at the conceptual level corresponds (prototypically) to a clause unit at the syntactic level. Gapping constructions relate not just the fillers of the roles in a single frame but also the various fillers of the same role in different frames. Therefore we would expect those fillers to be syntagmatically close to the extent that the two relational aspects can be accommodated simultaneously.","Note that the case of simple constituent coordination can be seen as the optimal solution to multiple frame realization as far as (7) is concerned, and is generally preferred. 344 (d) John and Paul lent me some money It represents the case where clause unity has been traded off for for the conceptualized unity of the two fillers of the same slot. (Accordingly we get a reading where John and Paul act as a single 'financial entity' only in (9d), but not in the corresponding gapping construction (9c).)","In (8a), on the other hand, we have a case where both clause unity and filler proximity can be integrated perfectly. Note that the view presented here obliterates the question whether (8a) is the result of constituent coordination or a case of gapping. A formally oriented theory might be troubled by a syntactic construction that can be 'redundantly' accounted for by two different rules or principles. For a cognitively oriented account such a coincidence presents no contradiction. 5","One might object that (7) makes the wrong predictions when comparing cases with one remnant to those with multiple remnants.","(10) (a) John offered me money and 0 0 0 good advice","(b) John offered me money, and Paul 0 0 good advice Clearly the additional remnant in (10b) in-creases the distance between the two fillers of the recipient role of"]},{"title":"offer,","paragraphs":["yet both sentences in (10) seem equally unproblematic. However, note that as soon as more than one remnant is present their role assignments mutually constrain each other, thus effectively making more","5Van Oirsouw (1987) has tried to develop a unified rule of deletion in coordinations, covering cases otherwise treated as separate rules, such as gapping, conjunction reduction, right-node raising, VP deletion, etc. One of the motivations for such an attempt is that these rules have a certain amount of overlap, i.e. there are constructions which fall into the scope of more than one rule, yet no single rule covers all cases. This is considered undesirable from a metatheoretical point of view since it apparently introduces ambiguity and redundancy.","A different view may be derived frmn the notion of radial categories as it arises in human categorization behavior (Lakoff, 1986). The sentences to be accounted for are apparently clustered around a small number of constructions (or rules). These constructions, however, are not completely unrelated; rather they are linked to each other by those special cases where more than one rule overlap. Thus the overlap between rules is not undesirable but cognitively advantageous since it allows the complete set of constructions to be perceived as a unified phenomenon. information available to the interpretation process. (()lie fundamental constraint that comes into play is that every filler can fill only one role. Furthermore linear order information is now available.) 3.2 Case marking and prepositions In languages that case-mark their verb arguments we would expect this device to provide very strong (in fact, mandatory) clues for role assignment. This can be verified in German, where noun phrases are case-marked, except for those consisting only of single proper nouns.","(11) (a) Ich sah, wie der Englitnder den Franzosen begriigte und der Deutsche 0 (3 I saw how the Englishman-NOM the Frenchman-ACC welcomed and the GermanCNOM 13 13","(b) ?:Ich sah, wie Peter Paul begriil3te und Hans 13 (3 I saw how Peter Paul welcomed and Hans 13 0","(c) Ich sah, wie Peter Paul begriiflte und (3 Hans I3 I saw how Peter Paul welcomed and 0 Hans 13 (11a) and (llb) have identical constituent structure (up to the noun phrase level) and are both non-optimal by proximity considerations. (1 la) can be made acceptable with appropriate contrastive intonation, while (11b) remains awkward. Instead, the interpreta.tion corresponding to (11c) is easily obtained, again in accordance with proximity.","In English, where case-marklng is generally not available, prepositions can play a similar role.","(12) (a) :Bill visited Jim yesterday after dinner, and 0 13 John 0 13","(b) Bill talked to Jim yesterday after dinner, and {3 13 to John {3 Again, both examples are awkward due to the great distance between successive role fillers, but in (12b) the prepositional marker to gives a strong clue for the intended attachment of John thus enhancing acceptability. 3.3 Topic-Focus structure In most of the cases seen so far a typical intonation pattern will naturally accompany the gapping construction, focusing on and contrast-ing the various fillers of same frame slot. In fact, as the distance between remnants and previous filler constituents increases, the interpretation has to be supported by increasing amounts of stress. Note that such a trade-off between syntactic proximity and focus structure makes sense in view of the evidential character of gapping proposed in (6).","(13) (a) Linda returned the textbook to the lio brary, but not (3 (3 0 to the one it be-longs to.","(b) Linda returned the textbook to the library, but not 13 13 the lecture tape 13","(c) Linda returned the textbook to the library, but not the other students in the class 0 0 (Italics indicate intonation centers.)","This behavior fits well into the general principle of role assignment proposed. In terms of our frame semantics account, focus ett~ctively 'foregrounds' a subset of the roles implying that those are the ones likely to be refilled.","There is evidence that the converse process works as well, i.e. that circumstances which 'background' certain roles provide support for gapping structures where those roles are not refilled. It seems that this is at least part of what happens in (3). The preceding sentence sets up Mary (i.e. her) as a topic, relative to which the other roles are foregrounded.","Sgall et al. (1986) have argued for incorporating descriptions of topic-focus structures into linguistic representations (rather than throwing them into the 'pragmatic wastebasket'). Clearly more work on the relation between syntactic configuration, focus and gapping is needed. To get an idea of the possibihties Mong these lines consider the following: Let us assume, following Sgall et al., that in the absence of special intonation in English declarative sentences elements towards the end of the sentence are increasingly 'focussed.' Then the gapping cases in (8) and (9) might be subsumed by focus structure: Refilled roles tend to occur towards the end of the clause because that is where default focus is located. It would be jumping to conclusion, how-ever, to say that all gapping phenomena can be 345 accounted for in term of focus structure, given the other cases discussed here. 3.4 Semantic constraints From the data presented so far we would expect any type of constraint which could potentially guide role assignment to have an impact on gapping. Therefore, semantic compatibility between the verb semantics and its arguments should make a difference in gapping contexts.

It would certainly be nice if some kind of simple ordering or hierarchy between the various factors could be established, although this may not be possible.
