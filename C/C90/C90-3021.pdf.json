Given the existence of a preference quantity P, it is easy to account for garden-path effects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences. Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity which is resolved in favor of one reading. Given two representations for the same input string that differ in processing load by at least P, only the less expensive structure will be maintained. If that sU'ucture is not comp,qtible with the rest of the sentence and the discarded structure is part of a successful parse of the sentence, a garden-path effect results.

There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as to whether or not more than one representation for an input can be maintained in parallel.

Section 2 describes the s~ucture of the underlying parser that is ,assumed. Section 3 includes the proposed syntactic properties. Section 4 examines a number of locally ambiguous sentences, including some garden-paths, with respect to these properties. Section 5 explores a number of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and demonstrates that the properties proposed in Section 3 make the right predictions with respect to processing over° load. Furthermore, it is demonstrated in this section that these properties seem to make the right predictions cross-- linguistically. Some conclusions ate given in the final section. 4 keeping in mind that the data are often controversial. See, for example, Kurtzman (1985)or Gorrell (1987) for a history of the debate along with evidence in support of the parallel hypothesis. Note in particular that data normally taken to be support for the serial hypothesis include garden-path effects and the existence of preferred readings of ambiguous input. However, as noted above, limiting the number of allowable representations is only one way of constraining parallelism so that these effects are also easily accounted for in a parallel framework.","/Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and pragmatic properties which are associated with significantproccssing loads.","Sin another syntactic theory, similar properties may be obtained from the principles that correspond to the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle in that theory.

The same empirical effects should result from these two sets of properties.","4This paper extends work reported in Gibson (1990) by ap-114 1 2 The Underlying Parse~ -~ The parser to which the memory limitation constraints apply must construct representations in such a way so that incomplete input will be associated with structure. Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, in principle, allow more than one structure tor an input string, so that the general constraints described in the previous section may apply to restrict the possibilities.

This algorithm should allow all possible parser operations to occur at each parse state. There are only two parser operations: attaching a node to another node and pushing a buffer cell onto a stack. In order to allow both of these operations to be performed in parallel, it is necessary to have the given data structures: the buffer and the stack-set. 2.1 Node Attachment I assume a hypothesis-driven node projection algorithm of the following form. In order to satisfy X Theory (Jackendoff (1977), Chomsky (1986b)), a maximal projection is constructed for each of a word's lexical entries when that word is input.

Since attachment always involves matching an It-node, • all obligatory arguments are projected as H-nodes.","3 Dynamic Application of the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle Following much current work in syntactic theory, I assume that the grammar consists of a set of environments where properties such as thematic role and Case may be assigned, along with a set of filters, each of which rules out representations lacking a necessary property. This approach to syntactic theory has been labeled the Principles and Parameters Approach (PPA) (Chomsky (1986a)). The particular syntactic theory that I will assume is known as Government and Binding theory (see Chomsky, (1981, 1986a, 1986b) along with the references cited in each), although the methodology of this work will apply to any syntactic theory of this form.","A filter-based syntactic theory presents an obvious set of candidate.s for load-bearing structural properties: the set of local violations of all syntactic filters. That is, given a constraint-based syntactic theory, it is reasonable to assume that there is a processing load associated with the local violation of each syntactic filter. In particular, I will consider the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle from Government and Binding Theory with respect to a theory of processing. These principles are given in (6) and (7): (6) The Projection Principle: Lexieal requirements must be satisfied at all levels of representation. (paraphrased from Chomsky (1981) p. 29). 6 (7) The 0-Criterion: Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (thematic role) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only one argument (Chomsky (1981) p. 36).","Note that the second part of the 0-Criterion- that each 0-role be assigned- Iollows from the Projection Principle. Thus the 0-Criterion that I will assume consists only of the first clause of (7): (8) The 0-Criterion (simplified): Each argument bears one and only one 0-role.","\"file dynamically applied 0-Criterion can be stated as the following processing property: (9) The Property of Thematic Reception (~I'R): Associate a load of"]},{"title":"x'cn","paragraphs":["PLUs of short term memory to each constituent that is in a position that can receive a thematic role in some co-existing structure, but whose 0assigner is not unambiguously identifiable in the structure in question.","6Government and Binding Theory assumes tile existcnce of a number of levels of representation, I assume that the level most relevant to parsing is surface structure or S..slructure. Thus the Projection F'rinciple applied to S-structure dictates flint lexical requiremenks be satisfied at that level. 2 115","The dynamically applied Projection Principle gives a similar property. This property is stated in terms of thematic elements. Following early work in linguistic theory, I distinguish two kinds of categories: functional categories and thematic or content categories (see, for example, Fukui and Speas (1986) and Abney (1987) and the references cited in each). Thematic categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions; functional categories include determiners, complementizers, and inflec-tion markers. I hypothesiz~ that thematic elements are more visible to the parser than their functional counterparts. This assumption is made explicit in the Property of Lexical Requirement, the dynamic version of the Projection Principle: (10) The Property of Lexical Requirement (PLR): Associate a load of xt~ PLUs of short term memory to each lexical requirement that is satisfied by a hypothesized constituent containing no thematic elements.","Note that all lexical requirements minimally involve the existence of a hypothesized structure. Thus the Property of Lexical Requirement ignores those structures whose lexical requirements are satisfied by either confirmed nodes or hypothesized nodes that contain thematic elements. The PLR will penalize only those structures with unsatisfied lexical requirements, where unsatisfied requirements consist of thematic element-less hypothesized structures.","When particular processing loads are associated with each of these properties, they will make a large number of empirical predictions in the theory of overload and preference. Since both the PTR and the PLR are properties dealing with the interpretation of an utterance, it is reasonable to assume as a default that the loads associated with these two properties, XTR PLUs and xt~ PLUs respectively, are the same. 7 (11) xTe = x~ = xt~t","It turns out that this a~ssumption is consistent with all inequalities that are obtained in this paper."]},{"title":"4 Ambiguity and the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement","paragraphs":["In order to determine what load is associated with each of the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement, I will first examine locally ambiguous sentences that either cause or do not cause garden-path effects. Consider sentence (12) with respect to the ~ and PLR: (12) John expected Mary to like Fred.","The verb expect is ambiguous: either taking an NP complement as in the sentence John expected Mary or taking an IP complement as in (12). 8 Thus there is a local ambiguity in (12) at the point of parsing the NP Mary.","7In fact, both the 0-Criterion and the Projection Principle are generally believed to follow from a more general principle: that of Full Interpretation (Chomsky (1986a)). If this is so, then the PLR and the PTR reduce to a single property: that of local uninterpretability. However, the principle of Full Interpretation has not yet been adequately formalized. Thus I will continue to appeal only to its components.","8Following current notation in GB Theory, IP=S and CP=S' (Chomsky (1986b)). Despite this local ambiguity, there is no difficulty parsing (12). Consider the state of the parse of (12) after the word Mary has been processed: (13) a. [m[Ne John ] [re expected Lvp Mary ]]]","b. [m Lvp John ] [vp expected [m [UP Mary ] ]]]","In (13a) the NP Mary is attached as the NP complement of expected. In this representation there is no load associated with either of the Properties of Thematic Reception or Lexical Requirement since all constituents that are positions to receive thematic roles, do so, and all lexical requirements are satisfied. In (13b) the NP Mary is the specifier of a hypothesized IP node which is attached as the complement of the other reading of expected. This representation is associated with at least xvn PLUs (= xlnt PLUs) since the NP Mary is in a position that can be associated with a thematic role (the subject position), but does not yet receive one in this structure. No load is associated with the Property of Lexical Requirement, however, since the lexical requirements of the verb expected are satisfied by nodes that contain thematic elements. Since there is no difficulty in processing sentence (12), the load difference between these two structures cannot be greater than P PLUs, the preference factor assumed in inequality (2). Thus the inequality in (14) is obtained: (14)Xlnt < P","Since the load difference between the two structures is not sufficient to cause a strong preference, both structures are maintained. Note that this is a crucial difference between the theory presented here and the theory presented in Frazier & Fodor (1978), Fr~ier (1979) and Pritchett (1988). In each of these theories, only one representation can be maintained, so that either (13a) or (13b) would be preferred at this point. In order to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing (12), Pritchett assumes that backtracking in certain situations is not expensive. No such stipulation is necessary in the framework given here.","Now consider a second locally ambiguous .,;entence, one that results in a garden-path effect: 9 (15) # i put the candy on the table in my mouth.","Sentence (15) is locally ambiguous at the point of parsing the word on. This preposition may attach as either an argument of the verb put, or as a modifier of the noun table. The argument attachment is locally preferred, although it turns out that this attachment is not compatible with the rest of the sentence. Thus a garden-path effect results. In order to see how the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement can account for this garden-path effect, consider the state of the parse after the word on has been input: (16) a.

Thus the maximal processing load associated with the parse of (33) is only 3xtnt PLUs, not enough to overload short term memory.","5.1 Processing Overload: Cross-Linguistic Predictions The examples discussed thus far are all English ones. A strong test of the theory presented here is presented by data from other languages. First let us consider centerembeddexl relative clauses in languages closely related to English. In particular, consider Dutch and German. It turns out that multiply center-embedded relative clauses become difficult in these languages at the stone point as they do in English: on the second embedding. For example, the German sentence (34) is unacceptable, as expected: (34) # Der Mann den die Frau die der Hund bib sah schwam. \"The man that the woman that the dog bit saw swam.\"","Unlike English, however, German and Dutch are verb final in subordinate clauses, so that verbs with lexical requirements for three thematic elements pose an interesting test to the theory. If the theory presented here is correct and it generalizes cross-linguistically, then constructions with three initial 0-role-requiring constituents should be acceptable. It turns out that this is in fact the case, as the German example (35) illustrates: (35) Ich glaube, dab John Mary das Geschenk gegeben hat. I believe that John Mary the present given has \"I believe that John has given Mary the present.\"","After the word Geschenk, there are three noun phrases that require thematic roles, but currently lack them. All lexical requirements are satisfied at this point in the parse, so the total load associated with this parse state is 3x~t PLUs. Thus (35) is predicted to acceptable, as desired.","Another good test for the theory presented here comes from cross-serial dependencies in Dutch. 12 In examples of cross-serial dependency, noun phrase arguments appear at the beginning of a subordinate clause, followed by their thematic role assigning verbs. It turns out that","12See Bresnan et al (1982) for a discussion of the syntax of such constructions. 118 5 constructions with three initial noun phrases are perfex;tly acceptable, as is exemplified in (36): (36) ... (hat Jan Piet de kinderen zag helpen zwemmen. ... that Jan Pier the children saw help swim \"... tlutt Jan saw Piet help the children swim?'","However, these constructions lose their acceptability with rite addition of further NP arguments: (37) a..9# ... dat Jan Piet Marie de kinderen zag helpen","laten zwemmen.","... that Jan Piet Marie the children saw help make","swim","\"... that Jan saw Piet help Made make the children","swim.\"","b. # ... dat Jan Piet Marie Karel de kinderen zag","helpen laten leren zwemmen.","... that Jan Pier Marie the children saw help make","teach swim","\"... that Jan saw Piet help Marie make Karel teach","the children to swim.\"","This result is predicted in the fraruework presented here. Four NP arguments locally lacking thematic roles force a load of 4xtnt, too much for human short term memory capacity.","Evidence from the processing of Japanese also supports the memory capacity results obtained here. Japanese is a verb final language, so that subjects and objects appear before the verb. Verbs that lake clausal complements provide an interesting test case for the theory presented here, since it is grammatical to place all NP arguments before the thematic role assigning verbs. For example, consider (38): (38) Jon wa Fred ga Biru we sukida to omotteiru. John TOPIC Fred NOM Bill ACe likes COMP thinks \"John thinks tlmt Fred likes Bill\"","Sentence (38) is perfectly acceptable, as is predicted by the theory presented here.

Fm~thermore, the success of the method provides empirical support for the particular properties used in the formation of the inequalities. ~[hus a theory of PLUs, the preference I~lctor P mid file overload face tot K provides a unified account of 1) acceptability and relative acceptability; 2) garden-path effects; and 3) pre~ ferred readings for mnbiguous input and perception of ambiguity."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["I would like to thank my informants: Alex Franz, Hiroaki Kitano, Ingrid Meyer, Teruko Mitamura and Michel Nederlof.
