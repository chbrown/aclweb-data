Korean Phonology Structure Grammar","As mentioned above, KLSG[5] is a new grammar theory for the Korean language and follows a unification-based grammar such as GPSG[6] and HPSG[7]. An outstanding characteristic of the KLSG, which has its descriptive capability, can be described in syntatic and morphological knowledges as well as \"knowledge of writting system, phonological and semantic knowledge with a unified grammar theory. In this paper we are only concerned with the phonological structure of the Korean language. 3-1. The phonological feature system in KPSG","All the Korean phonological categories of KPSG are presented by the sets of feature and they consist of feature and their values. In the following, we briefly described the phonological feature structure of KPSG. 2. Syllable Structure of Korean Language","A spoken language is not only a linear of sound segments, but is a group of vowels and consonants to form large units of a sound such as syllables, words and utterance.","In this section we present the nature and properties of the Korean phonetic structure : Korean syllable. The Korean syllable structure has two types: one is the type of consonant and vowel group(CV type : 71- : ga), and the other is the type of consonant, vowel and consonant group(CVC type : 7-1- : gak). ~[he Korean language, however, has a predominant writing system : HANGUL which is based on sound segments and syllables. F_zpecially, a HANGUL syllable corresponds to one character which is a combination of two or three sound symbols. In other words, a spoken syllable corresponds to a written syllable as a one-to-one fashion.","Structurally, a syllable may be divided in to three parts : oneset, necleus and coda. The most prominent part of a","SYL(Syllable) <--- {Consonant-Onset, Vowel Consonant-Coda};","This feature presents the consonant and vowel according to the articulatory properties of phoneme.","PDF(Phoneme Distinctive Feature) <--- {Nasal, Voiced .... };","This feature presents the practical phonetic values of the Korean language.","FOLL(FOLIow) ; This feature can take a set of categories as its values : the value corresponds to a list of categories. 3-2.

Since (1-3) is a binary., tree, we u~ (1-1') to get a syllable structure for (1-2'). its content is determined by the principles discussed later. The head in a rule plays the role of a primitive in the knowledge processing of KPSG, and the feature of head is applied by the following principle, A. Head Feature Principle(HFP)","The values of the idivklual HEAD features of the mother are indentical to the values of the HEAD features corn~'sponding to its head.","This principle guarantees that the values of these head features at the M(M') m×te and those at H no×It in the (1-3). The general idea behind the formulations is to state certain constraints regarding the head features, qhe head features include SYL and PV.","But tim HFP does not give necessary assignment of the values to the syllable's element. The rules for the sound sequence and the phonological processes are handled by another principle called subeat feature principle. B. Subcat Feature Principle(SFP)","'[he value of the FOLL feature of a head is indcntical to the FOLL feature of its naother except for the category which is identical to its daughter.","The sulx~lt feature principle states the rdationship that hol&; belween the FOLL vahte of the mothcr and that of the head in a given local phonology tree. C. Binding Frature Principle(BFP)","\"[]fis principle states the distritmtion of binding features over a given syllabic tree. A binding fealure is a feature whose value is determined with respect to a category I~r~sibly seperatcd by a number of syllable boundaries. \"Ilfis feature plays a crucial role in describing the phonological process: vowel harmony and so on.","~ihese principles are the constraints to select the adequate local syllabic tree among the inadequate local syllabic trees generated by the alxovc phonological rules: M ---> C H and M' ---> M H. The information of the basic feature values is prepared as the concrete phoneme entry, and is propagated a local tree to another local tree during the phonological processing, qtm operation which determines the structure cff feature and the sets of feature is called unification.","The feature system in phonological knowledge base system plays a role of the declarative feature knowledge and the unification applied by the principles correspond to the procedural knowdedge which specify the rules governing the sound sequence and phonological process. From the viewpoint of sound inventories, each rule is described deelaratively as a constraint condition which is ~ttled among the features. \"1tin equality and partiality among the feature are defined by the concept of unification. 4. Pratical examples","In this section we illustrate how the phonological rules in KPSG are operated. The processes of sound change vary in the degree of naturalness. The~.~. are various type.s of assimilations such as (1) nasalizal~0n, (2) palatalization, (3) assimilation and (4) vowel assimilation and ~ on. Among those various types of assimilation, we investigate the most colnmon type of tim nasal assimilation in the Korean language. (1-4) nasal assimilation(nassalization) a. k - - > ~/ .....

Feature Works","At present it is not clear just how to classify and integrate all the knowledge we have accumulated about the natural phonological processes into the grammars of individual languages. We introduced a unification-based grammar formalism for phonology. We verify that unification-based grammar formalism is a very useful theory for constructing the computational speech processing system, similar to a syntactical system.","In order to construct speech recognition and synthesis system, we need a number of various knowledge sources : acoustic, phonetics, phonology, prosody, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 'Fhe problem is how to represent and use those knowledges. The knowledge representation must keep the transparency among the knowledges with a unified way. Unification-based grammar formalism satisfy the above requirements.","We also attemp to describe the English phonological knowledge base system with a unification-based formalism, and are implementing the Korean speech recognition /synthesis system[8] with the KPSG. 6.
