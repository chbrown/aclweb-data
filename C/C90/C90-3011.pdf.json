The work described below is an outgrowth of a multilingual MT project initiated by the IBM in 1987 with the aim of studying multilingual translation using a common English language parser. The transfer system presented here is independent of the parsing and generation modules. Any source language parser can be used whose output can be expressed in a directed graph form. The transfer system is responsible for generating target language phrase structure. Target language word order and morphology are left to the generation modules. The transfer system is lexically based. Transfer rules, presented in the form of bilingual graphs, are declarative statements of symmetric transfer relationships between words, phrases or constructions in the two intertranslatable languages. Transfer is structure driven in that the transfer algorithm traverses the source language graph, nondeterministically trying to apply the relevant transfer rules in the lexicon. Each successful transfer yields a bilingual graph, whose target hmguage half is extracted and subjected to linearization and morphological generation. The main f(ycus of attention in our project is the development of the lexicon subsystem. The lexicon system consisk~ of separate transfer and monolingual lexicons and a common lexicon of language independent definitions.","Keywords: unification, machine translation, transfer, bilingual lexicon"]},{"title":"I. Unification based transfer","paragraphs":["Our approach is more transfer oriented than some other unification based approaches to MT (e.g., Beaven and Whitelock 1988). However, we argue, use of graph unification blurs the distinction between transfer and interlingua. A feature structure representing a phrase will contain information at several levels of linguistic analysis ranging from lexical identity to logical argument structure. Transfer rules can express bilingual correspondences at any level of abstraction as well as across different levels of structure. (Cf. Kaplan & al. 1989.) A transfer rule in our sense can consist of an arbitrary pairing of lexical entries, a complex correspondence across structures (e.g., \"change\" of grmnmatical construction including part of speech assignments), or a straightforward identification of arguments in logical form. When the translation relation is best stated in language independent (semantic) terms, transfer is trivial. Then monolingual lexicons, analysis and generation modules will do most of the work. Thus, to what extent a given rule has the character of a genuine transfer rule will depend on the degree of similarity of the languages under translation in the relevant respect. For instance, languages with similar tense systems can allow a straightforward identification of low level tense distinctions. Low level transfer simplifies the tasks of analysis and generation and allows tighter control of the translation relation. In particular, transfer idioms (multiword equivalences) can be stated directly without a detour through more abstract representations. In this sense, unification based transfer fills out the space separating interlingua and transfer."]},{"title":"2. Parsing","paragraphs":["Unlike approaches such as Kaplan & al (1989), which produce bilingual descriptions in the course of parsing source language text, transfer in our system has a completed parse as a starting point. Currently, this parse is produced by a general-purpose parser, PEG of IBM T.J.Watson Research Center (Jensen 1986), which is not unification-based. However, its output is close enough to a directed graph to 'allow conversion into the form required by the transfer system using a simple conversion interface. It appears to us that this decoupling of parsing from transfer is a safe move. Knowledge of the target language is not likely to influence ~)arsing of the source language in any significant fashion . 60 1"]},{"title":"3. lhe transfer system","paragraphs":["Our Iransfer system consists of two modules. A declarative module defines translation correst)ondenees of individual phrases, structures and features. The information is given in bilingual (or multilingual) transfer dictionaries. An algorithmic modtde actually builds the correspondence structure out of the source language f-structure and the transfer dictionaries. This component ensures that all necessary alternatives are considered and the relevant information is incorporated into a correct location in the correspondence structure. We discuss these two modules in turn."]},{"title":"3.1. The transfer lexicon","paragraphs":["A leading idea of the lexicon system is the separation of four different lexicons as follows: DGLEX c c T: X ~E r PFLEX DGLEX is a lexicon of general linguistic definitions of terms. There are two monolingtml lexicons, ELEX and FLEX, and a bilingual u'ansfer lexicon, TFLEX. The monolingual lexicons depend on DGLEX, and TFLEX can refer to the other three. No further dependencies are allowed. This increases the independence between tile component lexicons and makes them reusable for multilingual translation. The descriptions in both monolingual lexicons are kept independent of one gmother and linguistically motivated. Complex and ad hoc statements belong in TFLEX; it cannot be expected that all bilingual intertranslatability relations should follow linguistic generalizations. Correspondingly, we may distinguish two kinds of multi-word expressions. Language-internal idioms (e.g., keep tabs in English) are given in the monolingual lexicons, whereas the other type, which might be called \"transfer idioms\", are referred m at the level of tnmsfer entries only (e.g., have access to, which translates into one Finnish verb)."]},{"title":"3.2.

Transfer feature structures (TFS)","paragraphs":["The transfer relation between source and target language feature structures could be represented in different ways. Separate feature structures could be set up for the source language and the target language, and all explicit transfer relation between these two structures could be defined (Kaplan & al. 1989). in our system, there is only one larger transfer feature structure (TFS) which includes both feature structures and specifies the explicit transfer relation for intertranslatable phrases of source and target languages.

Transfer rules A transfer rule in this approach is formally just another transfer feature structure, similar to the bilingual structure. It is a partial specification of an acceptable intertranslatability relation. The rule is applied to a TFS by unifying it with a specified node in the \"ITS. The transfer process consists simply of adding of further information into a partially described instance of the transfer relation. There is no formal distinction between lexical and grammatical transfer rules. Examples of different types of rule are given in figures 3-5. Some aspects of our linguistic description will be briefly described. In monolingual lexicons, shills in grammatical function like the English active and passive are described as different Iinkings of arguments to grammatical functions, in this case, the subject and the object function. In transfer of complement-taking elements, we can then for the most part rely on the simple rule \"equate arguments\", which resulLs in correct bilingual correspondences given the language-particular linkings. For example, the verb disc~s (fig. 4) rakes as its second argument a direct object in English but an oblique complement in Finnish, but this language-particular informatkm need not be recapitulated in the transfer entry. There are also translation equivalents whose arguments do not match, and these receive slightly more complex transfer rules where argument equations are expressed separately. Graph unification descriptions are particularly simple and effective where the relevant structures consist of predicates u~king a restricted number of unique argument types, such as subject, object, or sentential complement. Adjuncts, which may have multiple instantiations for each head, need a different treatment. Each of the adjuncts has a unique modifiend (modif = the modified word),","paragraphs":["#1[E: 'T ..... o - t ~z,X. mXAM~ LE","CAT : NOUN","ADJT:#2[E: [LEX:ADDITIONAL CAT : ADJ PRED: [ARGI:#1","ARG2 : *NONE':","ARG3 : *NONE*]","ADJT : [E: [CAT :ADV","MODIF:#2]] MODIF:#I]","F: [LEX:LISA CAT : NOUN ADJT : [F : *NONE*] MOD IF : # i NUM:SG] ] NUM:PL PERS : 3","F: [LEX : ES IMERKKI CAT:NOUN] ] Fig. 6: A cyclic TFS 62 3 which it may share with other adjuncts.

It involves a recursive sort of the lexical entxies of the target language and the generation of morphologically inflected forms from sets of morphological features.

Discourse-related information relevant tot linearization is included in the feature structure. For Finnish subjectless clause types, we use a transfer ntle thai requires equation of rite English subject with the Finnish discourse function THEMA. Depending on clause type, any one of the Finnish arguments may appear as a TI-iEMA (e.g., \"about it one-must discuss\"; see fig. 7).
