The current a'end in AI is to express knowledge in a declarative form, but the independence of the know|edge sources causes artificial ambiguity° to order to be efficient, NL systems may need to integrate all the knowledge sourees~ btxt organizing the knowledge with this objective in mind is a rather difficult enterprise. The essential problem is the inadequacy of the control mechanisms in classical systems, no matter whether their architecture is serial, hierarchical or heterarchical. Erman et Lesser (80) suggest that a solution is to base complex systems on a blackboard architecture. This allows for distributed control, for autonomous 1. For an application of this principle in a parser, see (Sabah & Rady 83). and asynchronous use of the knowledge sources. The implementation of increasingly elaborate systems leads All to multi-expert's systems, that allow for complex communications and for flexible use of metal. knowledge (Haton 89).. Nevertheless, one important problem remains : once a process is started no external control can intervene. Hence, control remains intetrnittenl.","Our a~'chitecture integrates ff~se ~eas and eX o ~en~ ef~e 6l,~ck6oard model 6 9 including a con¢in.uous control system, allowing a sophisticated rt~rlwemen~ of the Wocesscs and of H~eir in~:ert,;.Ftion, qgis is reade possible by pars[gel imp(ementa~ion.

Another important role of this supervisor is to update the working memory : as it is the only one to have a global view, it is entitled to decide what representations should be kept and be updated in a global working memory. Finally, it builds a general representation of the reasoning process ; thus it can explain why a given process has been triggered. 446 1","The system may be used in such different applications as : user-friendly interfaces, on-line help in text processors, summaries of texts, intelligent tutoring systems, etc. 2. The CARAMEL model 2.1 The memory","As we have seen, natural language processing can be conceived of as a change of representation. To handle this task, we makes use of three kinds of memory :","- a short term memory, which receives the results of the perceptual processes.","- a working memory, which contains all the structures (eventually provisional) built by the different processes. The text is represented at the various levels differently according to the point of view. Even though the working memory functions like a blackboard, it is under the control of the master process.","- a long term memory which contains all the knowledge of the system. This memory contains for example information about morphology, words, grammar, syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and it is a stable representation of the current state of the world. All this knowledge is permanent, declarative and expressed in terms of conceptual graphs (Sowa 84), as this formalism facilitates the communication between processes 2. 2.2 Processes","Let us briefly mention some of the processes used in CARAMEL : a deterministic parser (Rady 83, Sabah et Rady 83, Francopoulo 88) based on case grammar (Fillmore 68) and systemic grammar (Halliday 73), an ellipsis (Sauvage 88) and an anaphorasolver, an error handler (Fournier 88), story inteIpretation processes (Sabah 78), (Berthelin 80), (Grau 84), a planner used in dialogue handling (Vilnat 86)[the work on dialogue draws on work from linguistics (Roulet 86) and philosophy (Searle 69, Grice 75)], and a sentence generator (Zock 90).","All these processes are triggered by a master process, the supervisor. Before we explain its functioning, let us see how the processes are represented in the system. 2. At present the implemented data corresponds to a French lexicon of 15 000 entries (about 350 000 conjugated forms), a semantic net of a thousand concepts, a grammar (350 rules) allowing the analysis of complex sentences with prepositional and relative phrases (in French), and pragmatic knowledge about the world (at present, the system knows only a few frames in order to test the validity of the processes). Representation of t,~e processes","In order to find the most adequate process in a given situation, the supervisor uses a representation of each process specifying its inputs and outputs. For example : (Sentence analysis (INPUT (otrrPtrr (Type list) (Elements words)) (Type cpt. graphs) (Element syntactic rp0 (Element semantic rpr))) CARAMEL distinguishes between the following two types of process : - Elementary processes (such as ellipse or anaphorae resolution), whose task is to comvlete gxi~stin_g r./gpresentations. In case of problem, they will call the supervisor. -Compound processes (parsing, story in-terpretation, generation., o), which are composed of elementary or compound processes. They build ~'~ r.Lqp/.~E¢~.~. In their turn, they can be considered sub-supervisors (based on an internal planning process, they decide what actions have to be performed and they know how to represent what has been done). 3, The supervisor","The supervisor triggers the adequate processes in order to build the necessary representations, it handles the various problems that can appear, and it represents the actions that have to be performed. Moreover, the supervisor builds a dynamic representation of the sequence of processes activated to solve the global task. This representation is built in the working memory and allows the system to give explanations about the strategy used. As each complex process acts as a supervisor with regards to its subprocesses, the system has a recursive structure.","The supervisor analyses the representations stored in the working memory and deduces the processes that may be triggered, it also takes into account the needs of the active processes and the global task: it has to handle interruptions coming from them. Thus, the system integrates bottom-up and top-down control.","The basis of this reasoning is a planning process. If, for example, the task of the system is to understand a story, it knows a priori that it has to built a global representation of it. First, a .static planner builds the sequence of complex processes that can build this type of representation (parser + story understanding). The same type of reasoning produces sub-plans for the complex processes involved. For 2 447 example, this means in the case of story understanding : action, character and pragmatic interpretations, followed by a synthesis)","This first phase is independent of the data to be processed, and, as some aspects are not yet well defined, several processes may be optional (pronoun resolution, error correction...). In a second phase, a dynamic planner allows the system to adapt the static plan to the specific data present in the working memories. Whenever a problem arises, the dynamic planning process takes care of it, by determining (based on the inputs and outputs of the available processes) the kind of process capable to solve it. This mechanism is similar to the \"hierarchical planning\" proposed by Stefik (81), or Wilkins (84). We use a similar kind of meta-planning : if there are several solutions possible, they are ordered by the supervisor such as to increase efficiency.","The existence of these two planning phases allows that a process selected in the static planning phase can break down. When this occurs, a help request is sent to the supervisor which triggers a dynamic planning phase. When the processes selected in this second phase solve the problem, the original process is resumed 3. 4o Co.clus~os","In this paper, we have presented a general architecture capable of adapting its control strategy to the requirements of different tasks. It permits a modular implementation, it makes the modification of existing processes and the integration of new capacities in the system easier°","Another characteristic of our system (not developed here) is that it is capable to explain its actions. This has proven quite helpful when putting the final touch to the rule-base.","This capacity has interesting consequences on the learning process : as the system remembers the actions it has performed in a given situation, it is able - in the near future - to find analogies between the memorized situations and the actual one. In consequence it can bypass the supervisor when reasoning. CARAMEL is thus a flexible system, capable to manage a great number of different tasks, with an adaptatire architecture and an optimal use of processes. 3. Parallelism offers another solution to adapt the static plan to the data. Its implementation, currently under development, will permit a continuous control on the processes: the supervisor will be able to examine the representations that are being constructed and, possibly interrupt a given process in order to wait for the result of another one or to give it some advice.
