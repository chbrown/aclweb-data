They are often hard to translate by machines, because of both syntactic and semantic differences between languages. This problem seriously affects upon the generation process because those verb components in interlingua are hardly rearranged correctly in the target language. We propose here a method in which each verb element is defined as a mathematical function according to its type of type theory. This formalism gives each element its legal position in the complex verb in the target language and certifies so-called partial translation. In addition, the generation algorithm is totally free from the stepwise calculation, and is available on parallel architecture."]},{"title":"1 The problem of complex verb translation 1.1 The difference between languages","paragraphs":["In this section, we will briefly mention the difficulties of complex verb translation. The term complex verb refers to those verb structures that are formed with modal 'verbs and other auxiliary verbs in order to express rnodMity or aspects, and which are attached to the original base verb.","For example, in a complex verb: seems to have been swimming (1) 'swim' is in both the progressive aspect and the past tense, upon which 'seem' is attached with the inflec-tion of agreement for the third person singular. Such a structure is so often hard to translate to other languages both because surface structures become different between languages, and because some aspectual/modal concepts cannot be found in the target language in the generation process. 1","We admit that the most recalcitrant problem in verb phrase translation is that the differences of tense, aspect, mood, and modality systems. Hence, we can","XThe systems of tense, aspect, and modality are different from language to language, and their typology ha.s been discussed in linguistics [1], [21, [9]. hardly find a verb element in the target language, which corresponds with the original word exactly in meaning. However we also need to admit that the problem of knowledge representation of tense and aspect (namely time), or that of mood and modality is not only the problem of verb translation, but that of the whole natural language understanding. In this paper, in order to realize a type calculus in syntax, we depart from a rather mundane subset of tense, aspects, and modMities, which will be argued in section 2. 1.2 The difference in the structure In the Japanese translation of (1):"]},{"title":"oyoi-de-i-ta-rashii","paragraphs":["the syntactic main verb does not change from"]},{"title":"oyoi-","paragraphs":["(swim), which is the original meaning carrier; and the past tense is replaced by"]},{"title":"-ta-","paragraphs":["which is indistinguishable between past and perfect in Japanese.

The key issue is that those external ones concern only the speaker's attitude of the sentences in illocutionary situations in order to express deonticity, uncertainty, and so on, and are indifferent to the sentence subjects. Although there should be a controversial discussion as to whether a certain modal verb is connected to speakers or not 2, we will engage this matter in the following formalization of complex verb translation."]},{"title":"2 Formalization of complex verb translation","paragraphs":["We will give a formal definition of modality as a function here, and discuss the strategy of verb complex generation in which each modal element is used as a function itself. In this section we use the term 'modal functions' both for modal operators and aspectuM operators as long as there is no confusion.","2Although the concept of modality is based on the deontic distinction/epistemic between possibility and necessity such as 'can', 'may', 'must', tbe term is sometimes used in a broader sense inclusively 'will'(volitive) or 'can'(ability). We distinguished the externality by its independent tense and polarity (positive/negative), so that broad-sense modal verbs such as volitive and ability are regarded as actually internal while narrow-sense ones are often external."]},{"title":"354","paragraphs":["Externality To clarify the externality of modal functions mentioned in the previous section, we put the following definition: Definition of externality: We call those modal functions which can have their own tense and negation external; otherwise we call them internal. Interlingua Here we propose the simplified sets of modalities, aspects, and tenses, which are recognizable both in English and in Japanese, mostly based upon the work of [7]. tense = {past, present, future} aspect = {progressive, perfect, iterative, in-choative, terminative} external modality = {possible, necessaw}®{epistemic, deontic} or {hearsay, seem} internal modality = {able} The two dimensional analysis of eplstemic and deontic is considered, reflecting the duality in meaning of 'may' and 'must'. Verb elements as function We assume that the crude result of a parsing process for a complex verb is the list of verb elements such as: past1, seem, past2,progressive, swim,... (2) Our objective is:","* to construct the interlingua expression from these verb elements such as: (q-ed(seem)) ((-t-ed(progres sive)) (swim))","• and to derive a surface structure of the target language from the interlingua expression. In order to do this, we will regard each verb element as a function. The main concern here is the domain of each function. For example, an external \"past\" operator +ed should operate upon external verbs, not in-cluding internal verbs. We will realize this idea, being independent of each intra-grammar in complex verbs of various languages, in the following section.","We express a verb complex as a composition of a root-word, tense, negation, and verb-complement, in which root and verb-form are included; veomp may be included recursively.","Fig. 3 is an example of a ,k-function of tt perfect: k̀xVe~b-,t~c~u~e.perfeet(x) which takes a verb structure as a parameter, and produce a more complicated structure.","(vp (roet; be) (tense negation) (vcomp (root swim)","(vform ing) ))"]},{"title":"(~p O'oot h~ve)","paragraphs":["(tense negation)","(vcomp (root be) (vrorm pp) (vcemp (root swim)","(vform ing)))) Figm'e 3: perfect-ization in English"]},{"title":"3 Type inference for complex verb composition","paragraphs":["We will make use of polymorphic type theory [6] in the fnrther formalization. The reason we adopt the type formalism is to realize \"the internality of concatenation rules\"; namely each verb element shonld know which elements to operate upon, instead of being given a set of grammar on concatenation. Behind this purpose lie tile following two issues:","• parallel computation: to realize a fas~ parallel computation on coming parallel architecture",", partial translation: for machine translation to be robu:-'t for ill-founded information in the lexicon 3.1 ~pes for verb phrase First we will set up several mnemonic types. They are not terminal symbols of type calculus, but mnemonic identifiers of certain types.","A set of mnemonic types: {root, int, ext, teasel, negi, tense~, ne9~} For example, we can assume the following r' as a result of our parser.","F = {seem : ext,+ed : tensei, swim : root, progressive : int} where a : a means that a is of type a. (In that parser, each syntactic category in the source language was replaced by a mnemonic type that is actually regarded as a category of the interlingua.) We use cp as a type variable denoting 'verb phrase , . Because we can regard any verb element as a modifier from a verb phrase to another phrase, those mnemonic types are always unified with a type '~ -~ qo', except 'root' of type ~. The type <emposition is the process that specifies the internal variables of~ gradually. We introduce here the notion of 'most general unifier (mgu)' by Milner [6], which combines two type expressions and the result becomes a set of variable instantiations which were contained in dmse type expressions. 3.2 A simple example Let us consider an example of concatenating seem with +ed(swim).

We will argue what each mnemonic means in this subsection. Concretely saying, we will specify what kind of internal variables can occur in various verb types.","Our presupposition is that a 'full-fledged' complex verb contains 'external part' as well as 'internal part'. So that a verb type ~, is assumed to have two internal type variables ~oi,,t and ~oCxt. Each of them has a 'head' verb which incurs tense or negation if exists. We call a compound of tense and negation 'cap'. As for a cap, we assume a construction of: negation(tense(X)) a As a result, our full-fledged verb type becomes as fig. 5.","aThis formalization is actually after the consideration of the following generation process.

In the conventional generation, an internal verb element such as 'progressive' must be concatenated to the structure, prior to an external element such as 'seem'.
