In sentence comprehension, for example, the phonological or morphological information may or may not be partially missing due to some noise, the semantic information may or may not be abundant because of familiality or ignorance on the topics, and so forth. Thus the information distribution is very diverse and rather orthogonal to the underlying information structure consisting of the modules of morphological, syntactic, pragmatic, and other constraints.","This diversity of information distribution gives rise to a very complex, non-modular flow of information in cognitive processes, as information flows from places possessing information to places lacking information. In order to deal with this complexity, a cognitive system must be designed to include two different logical layers: '(1) Information represented in terms of constraints,","*The work reported here started as the author's doctoral research at Tokyo University, and has developed filrther at Electrotechnical Laboratory and ICOT.

If one. be it human or nature, were to implement such diverse information flow by procedural programming, the entire system would quickly become too complex to keep track of, failing to maintain the modularity of the system. This is what has always happened, for example, in the development of natural language processing systems.","The rest of the paper exemplifies the efficacy of the constraint paradig,n with regard to natural language. We wil! first discuss a general picture of language faculty immediately obtained fl'om the constraint-based view, and then derive a model of sentence processing neutral between comprehension and production. This model will be shown to fit several linguistic phenomena. Due to the generality of the perspective, the phenomena discussed below encompass apparently unrelated aspects of natural language."]},{"title":"2 Language and Constraint","paragraphs":["From tile constraint-based perspective immediately follows a hypothesis tI'lat the same constraints (i.e., lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and whatever), corresponding to (1), and the same processing architecture, corresponding to (2), should underly both sentence comprehension and production. Other authors have expressed less radical stances. For instance, Kay [11] adopts two different grammars for parsing and generation. Our hypothesis is also stronger than Shieber's [16]; Although he proposes to share not only one grammar but also one processing architecture between the two tasks, this 'common' architecture is, unlike ours, parameterized so as to adapt itself to parsing and generation in accordance with different parameter settings. 1 149","As a corollary of our strong uniformity hypothesis, we reject every approach postulating any procedure specific to sentence comprehension or production. For instance, we disagree upon the ways in which the Determinism Hypothesis (DH) [12] has been instantiated so far. DH permits to assume only one partial structure of a sentence at a time, and the approaches along this line [2, 3, 12, 14] has postulated, beyond necessity, specific ways of disambiguation for specific types of ambiguity in sentence comprehension and production.","Instead we view sentence processing as parallel computation. When a sentence is either comprehended or produced, several partial structures of it, we assume, are simultaneously hypothesized. The degree of parallelism should be limited to fall within the small capacity of the short-term memory (STM), so that we obtain the same sort of predictions as we do along the determinist account. For instance, the difficulty in comprehending garden path sentences like (3) may be attributed to the difficulty of keeping some structural hypotheses in STM. (3) The chocolate cakes are coated with tastes sweet. As discussed below, our approach quantitatively estimates the difficulty in processing embedded constructions like (4) also on the basis of the memory limitation.","(4) The cheese the rat the cat the dog chased caught bit was rotten. Since DH does not account for such difficulty, incidentally, it seems superfluous to postulate DH. We consider DH jnst~ as approximation of severe memory limitation, and avoid any stipulation of such a hypothesis."]},{"title":"3 A Common Process Model","paragraphs":["Among the partial structures hypothesized during comprehension or production of a sentence, we pay at-tention to the"]},{"title":"maximal st~'uctures;","paragraphs":["the structures such that there is no larger structures.

Sentence processing, whether comprehension or production, is regarded as parallel construction of several maximM structures. Thus sentence processing as & whole is characterized by specifying what a maximal structure is.","We assume the grammatical structure of a sentence to be a binary tree. Here we identify a word with its grammatical category, so that a local structure, such as [NP Tom], is regarded as one node rather than a partial tree consisting of two distinct nodes. It is just for expository simplification that we assume binary trees. Our account can be generalized straightforwardly to allow n-ary trees. Further, the essence of our discussion below is neutral between the constituency-based approaches and the dependency-based approaches. Here we employ a representation scheme of the former type, without committing our-selves to the constituency-based framework.","From the general speculation below, it follows that a maximal structure should be the left-hand half of (5)."]},{"title":"(5) s","paragraphs":["This maximal structure consists of the path form S to A and the part to the left of this path, except for"]},{"title":"Bi-1","paragraphs":["and the nodes between Bi-1 and Ai (those on tile slant dotted lines) for 1 < i < d+l;Aiandthenodesbetween Ai and Bi are included in the maximal structure.

Thus our model is similar to left-corner parser [1], though our discussion is not restricted to parsing.","This characterization of a maximal structure is obtained as follows.

Note further that the entire sentence structure, being a binary tree, also involves one less nonterminal nodes than words. Accordingly, postulating n - 1 nonterminM nodes versus n words in a maximal structure amounts to postulating that the words and the nonterminal nodes are processed at approximately constant speed relative to each other. 1 The number of words is a measure of lexical information, and the number of nonterminal nodes is a measure of syntactic and semantic information, among others. Hence if all the types of linguistic information (lexical, syntactic, semantic, etc.) are processed at approximately the same relative speed, then a maximal process should include nearly as many words as nonterminal nodes.","This premise is justified, because if different types of information were processed at different speeds, then","tThe rate of n words versus n - 1 nonterminals does not precisely represent the constant relative speed, but the discrepancy here is least possible and thus acceptable enough as approximat ion. 150 2 there would arise imbalance of information distribution across the corresponding different domains of information. Such imhalance should invoke information flow from the domains with higher density to the domains with lower density of information distribution, when, as in the case of language, those domains of information are tightly related with each other. That is, information flow eliminates such imbalance, resulting in approximately the same speed of processing across different but closely related domains of information.","Now that we have worked out how many nodes a maximal structure includes, what is left is which nodes it includes. Let us refer to A in (5) as the current active word and the path from the root node S to the current active word as the current active path. It is natural to consider that a maximal structure includes the nodes to the left of the current active path, because all the words they dominate have already been proce,;sed. Thus we come up with the above formula-tion of a maximal structure, if we notice that the nodes on the solid-line part (including Ai) of the current active path in (5) are adjacent to nodes to the left of the current active path, whereas the other nodes on the current active path (those on the dotted lines, including Bi) do not except for the mother of A, which will be processed at the next moment."]},{"title":"4 Immediate Processing","paragraphs":["According to this model, any word should be in,mediately processed, particularly in parsing, in the sense that corresponding amount of syntactic and semantic structure is tailored with little delay. The intrasentential status of a word is hence identified as soon as it is encountered. This contrasts with the determinist accounts which ,'assume lookahead to deal with local ambiguity.","Empirical evidences support our position. In Marslen-Wilson's [13] experiment, for instance, the subjects were asked to listen to a tape-recorded utterance and to say aloud what they hear with the shortest possible delay. Some subjects performed this task with a lag of only about one syllable, and yet their error reflected both syntactic and semantic context. For example, one of such a subjects said lie had heard that the Brigade ... upon listening to He had heard at the Brigade .... Such a phenomenon cannot be accounted for in terms of the determinist accounts with fixed parsing procedures. In our model, it is explained by just assuming that only the most active maximal structure tailored by the subject survives the experimental situation."]},{"title":"5 ~.~ansient Memory Load","paragraphs":["By transient memory load (TML) we refer to tile amount of linguistic information temporarily stored in STM.

It has thus been demonstrated that the speculation to derive the model has empirical supports, lending justification for the constraint p~radigm. In particular, our theory has been shown to be more adequate than the determinist approach, which must postulate a procedural design of the human language faculty.","A computational formalization of our model will be possible in terms of constraint programming, as discussed by Hasida et al. [8, 9, 17]. Most of the time, a natural language processing system in terms of procedural programming has been designed to be a series of a syntactic analysis procedure, a semantic analysis procedure, a pragmatic analysis procedure, and so on, in order to reflect the modularity of the underlying constraints. }towever, such a design imposes a strong limitation on information flow, restricting the system's ability to a very narrow range of context. One naturally attempts to remedy this so as to, say, enable the syntactic analysis module to refer to semantic information, but this attempt must destroy the modularity of the entire design, ending up with a program too complicated to extend or even maintain. Constraint paradigm seems to be the only way out of this difficulty."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Aho, A. V. and Ullman, U. D.
