The author especially era. phasizes the necessity of complex feattwes for description of Chinese Iaruguage.","paragraphs":["1 Multiple- Value Label Function The phrase structure grammar (PSG) was used extensively in the parsing of natural law guage. A PSG can be expressed by a tree graph where every node has a correspondent label. The relationship between the node x and its label y can be described by a mono-value label function L:","L(x) = y For every value of node x, there is only one corresponding value of label y.","In 1981, we designed a multilingual automatic translation system FAJRA (from Chinese to French, English, Japanese, Russian, German). In 1985; we designed two automatic translation systems GCAT (from German to Chinese) and FCAT (from French to Chinese). In system FAJRA, we must do automatic analysis of Chinese, in system GCAT and FCAT, we must do automatic generation of Chinese language. We found that the linguistic features of Chinese ex... pressed by the mono-value label function of PSG is rather limited. In the automatic analysis of Chinese language, PSG can not treat properly the ambiguity, the result of analysis often bring about a lot of ambiguous structures. In the automatic generation of Chinese language, the generative power of PSG is so strong that a lot of ungrammatical sentences are generated. It is the chief drawback of PSG. In order to overcome this drawback of PSG, in system FAJRA, we proposed a multiple- value label function to replace the mono- value label function, and in","systems GCAT and FCAT, we further improved this approach. A multiple-value label function can be described asbelow:","L(x) = {y~, Y2,..., Y~} whereby a label x of tree can correspond to several labels {y~, ya, ..., y=}. By the means ol; this function, the generative power of PSG was restricted, the number of ambiguous structures were reduced, and the drawback of PSG was efl]ciently overcome. Beginning with the augmented transition network (ATN) concept and .inspired by J.Bresnan's work on lexically oriented non-transformational linguistics, the lexical functional grammar (LFG) framework of J. Bresnan and R. Kaplan was evolved. Simultanously, M. Kay devise(]. the functional m~Afication grammar (FUG)., G. G~dar, E. Klein and G. Pullum proposed. the generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG). Implementation of GPSG 1"]},{"title":"118 at","paragraphs":["Hewtett-Packard led C.

Therefore, The concept of complex features is very important for present development","of computational linguistics. In the systems I;A,IRA, GCAT and FCAT, the values of labels must be the features of language, so the mtdtiple- value labels must be also the complex features of language. In fact, the concept of multiple--value labels and the concept of complex features is very similar. Historically, all these concepts are the results of separate researches in computational linguistics for improvement of PSG. ThLts we can take our multiple-value labels as complex features.","The famous linguist De Saussure (1857--1913) had pointed out in his <Course in General Linguistics> : \" Language in a manner oi\" speaking, is a type of algeb,a consisting solely of complex terms\" (p122, English version, 1959). He takes the flexion of\" Nacht : N~/chte\" in German as the example. The relation \"Nacht : Niichte\" c:m be expressed by an algebraic formu-la a/b in which a and b are not simple terms but result from a set of relations .... complex terms. The complex terms of Nacht are: norm, feminine gender, singular number, nominatix'e case, its principal vowel is \"a\". The complex terms of N'~.chte are: noun, feminine gender, plural number, nominative case, its principal vowel is \"fi\", its ending is \"e\", the pronunciation of\" ch\" changes from/x/to"]},{"title":"/C.'.","paragraphs":["De Saussure said: \"But language being what it is, we shall find nothing simple in it regardless oF our approach; every where and always there is the stone conlplex equilibrium of * \" ~ , 1959). So ~e~m, that mutually condition each other\" (P122,E. v. called\" complex terms\" mentiot~ed here by Dc Saussure is nothing but the \"complex features\" or the \"multiple -value labels\"in computationa! linguistics. After all, De Saussure is a scholar with a foresight, fie has proved himself to be a pioneer of modern linguistics. The concept of '~omplex terms\" oC De Saussure has served as a source of inspiration for tks to proposed the concept of \"muhiple-value labels\". However, the property of Chinese language is more important than the concept of De Saussure in the dex.elopmemnt of our \"multiple--value labels\"( or \"complex features\" ), because without the \"multiple- value labels\" (or \"complex features\" ) we can not adequately describe the Chinese language in the autornatic translation. {2 Necessity of Complex Feature for Description of Chinese Language","If there is a necessity of complex features in description of' English, then this necessity is more obvious fbr description of Chinese.","The reasons are as following: 1. There is not one--to--one correspondence relation between the phrase types (or parts of","speech) m~d their syntactic functions in the Chinese sentences. Chinese is dilRrent from Endish. In English, the phrase types generally correspond to their syntactic functions. For example, we have NP + VP --- > S in English, whereby NP corresponds to subject, VP corresponds to predicate, and S is a sentence, becoming a construction\" i19 subject + predicate\". There is a one-to-one correspondence between the phrase types and their syntactic ftmctions. In Chinese, the structure \"NP + VP\" can form a sentence, so we have also NP + VP - - > S. E. g. in phrase"]},{"title":"\"d~ 2E / IN ~\" (little","paragraphs":["Wang coughs), \"/]x"]},{"title":"t\"","paragraphs":["(little Wang) is a NP, \"~N ~\" (to cough) is a VP, forming a construction\" suk!ject .+predicate\". However, in many cases, the NP doesn't correspond to the subject, the VP doesn't correspond to the predicate. For example, \"~y~; /i~~-t\" (progrmming)in Chinese, \".~ j:~\" (program) is a NP,"]},{"title":"\"iRi-l\"","paragraphs":["(.to design) is a VP, but this NP is a modifier, and this VP is the head of the structure \"NP +"]},{"title":"VP\".","paragraphs":["The structure \"NP + VP\" can not form a sentence, but fbrm a new noun phrase NPI: NP + VP - - > NP[. So this noun phrase becomes a construction \" modifier + head\". Similar example are: \"i~--N / ~]~\" (langtuage learning),"]},{"title":"\"~","paragraphs":["~ / rN-~\" (physics examination), etc. In these phr~,~ses, the phrase tyws \"NP + VP\" can not form a construction \"subject + predicate\", but form a construction \"modifier -~: head\". In this case, the \"NP + VP\" is a syntactically ambiguous structure, the simple features \" NP + VP\" can not distinguish the differences between the construction \"subject + predicate\" and the construction \"modifier + head\". We must use the complex features to describe these dif-","ferences. The structure \" NP -I- VP\" which forms a construction \" subject + predicate\" can be formularized as following complex .feature set: CAT = N + CAT --= V [_ [_ SF = SUBJ_ SF = PRED _t _ whereby K is the feature of\" the phrase type, NP and VP are the values of this feature; CAT is the feature o[\" the parts of speech, N and V are the values of this feature; SF is the feature o~\" syntactic function, SUB.I and PRED are the values of this feature.

Obviously, the structure"]},{"title":"\"NP +","paragraphs":["VP\"is ambiguous, there are two syntactically different constructions included in this structure, their phrase types are identical, but their syntactic functions are different. In order to adequately discribe the differences of them, we have to use the complex features in deed. In English, we have VP + NP - -> VP1, the VP corresponding to the predicate:, the NP to the object, and VP1 is a new verb phrase, it is a construction \"predicate + object\". In Chinese, the structure \"VP + NP\"can form a new verb phrase, so we have also VP + NP","- - > VP1. For example, \"$,-]~/~ / I'~']~\" (to discuss a problem) in Chinese, \"$¢i\"~\" (to discttss) is a VP, \"l'~-i]~\" (problem)is a NP, forming a new verb phrase \"predicate + object\". 120 However, in many cases, VP doesn't correspond to predicate, NP doesn't correspond to ob ject.

In this case, the structure \"VP + NP\" is syntactically ambiguous. The simple features \"VP + NP\" is not enough to distinguish the differences between the construction \" predicate + object\" and the construction \"modifier + head\".

SF = HEAD2 + head\" can be whereby MODF and HEAD are the values of feature SF. Obviously we can not only use the simple fcature to describe the structure \"VP + NP\", we have to use the complex features. 2. For the construction which have the same phrase type structure and the same syntactic function structure, its semantic relation may be diflErent. So there is not simple one--to-one corre-","spondence between the syntactic function and its semantic relation. The values of semantic relation feature are the following: agent, patient, instrument, scope, aim, :result,... etc. In English, there is no much correspondences between the syntactic function of sentence element and its semantic relation. In Chinese, the correspondence is more complicated and sophisticated than in English. In the construction\" subject + predicate\" with corresponding phrase type structure \" NP + VP', the subject may be agent, but it may also be patient, or instrument, etc. For example, in the sentence \"iIf~/i;~T\" (I have read), the subject \":ffB\" (I) is the agent, but in the sentence \" --p} / ~ T\" ( the book has been read), the subject \"@\" (book) is the patient, and the verb \"i~T\" (to read) doesn't change its form, it always takes the original form. In most European languages, if the subject is the agent, then the verb must take an active form, and if 121 the subject is patient, then the verb must take the passive form. However, In Chinese, the verb always keeps the same form no matter whether the subject is an agent or a patient. In an overwhelming majority of cases, the passive form of verb is seldom or never used in Chinese. By this reason, in the atttomatic information processing of Chinese language, it is not enough to only use the features of phrase types and synt~tic functions, we must use the features of semantic relations, thus the features for description of Chinese language will become mor~ com-","plex. In the structure \"NP + VP\", if the syntactic function of NP is subject, and the semantic relation of NP is agent, then the complex features of this structure can be formularized as following: [ K=NP ~ K=VP ] CAT = N + CAT = V ] SF = SUBJ l k.
