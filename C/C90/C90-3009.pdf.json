While this system has been shown to work with a nulnber of languages, and while its con> putationM simplicity makes it very attractive, such a model forces one to make a rather radical distinction between, say, suflixation and a modification function such as unfiaut. Furthermore, the model is concerned with strings of segments - that is, it does not a.llow one to make any reference to entities above the level of the segment (syllables, feet, etc.), except by the use of rather awkward boundary diacritics. This is in contrast with much recent lit~guistic work on phonology, which i~w.: rediscovered suprm~egmenta! concepts, such a< ,aylJabie,;, metricM feet and corse 48 groups. (see e.g. Liberman & Prince, 1976, Durand,1986.)","That there is some interaction between the processes of phonology and those of morphology can be readily seen by looking at an example from Matthews (1974). The Latin verb alternations 'seribo' (I write) and 'scripsi' (I wrote) apparently involve both. The addition of the '-s-' in the past tense form is purely morphological, while the alteration of the /b/ to a /p/, while it could again be morphological, could also be accounted for by natural phonological processes which operate in other morphological environments, as a ease of voicing assimilation, with the voicing feature of the/b/assimilating to that of the/s/to give"]},{"title":"Ipl.","paragraphs":["With this in mind, it is no surprise that the types"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["functions which can occur in morphology are gem erally similar to phonological processes and often require reference to at least a. subset of those concepts required for the description of phonological phenomena.

Koskenniemi's model was strictly segmental and used only monadic phones and phonenaes, rather than feature bundles.

A syllable structure as in Figure 1 is assumed, where the onset and coda consist of consonants and the peak consists of vowels. (The onset a.nd coda may optionally be empty.)","The existence of a rhyme constituent is not entirely uncontroversial (see Clements and Keyser, 1983),","1 Morphological Operations Language Using Syllabic-based Constructs syll onset rhyme peak coda Figure 1: Syllable structure but is nonetheless widely accepted by linguists and its role in morphological description can be seen by looldng at the English verb alternations, \"bring\" - \"brought\", \"think\" -\"thought\" etc., in which the rhyme constituent in the past tense form is always /w/ (assmning that the/t/is a past tense suffix).","A stem ~\" consists of a sequence of syllables, without any further structure between the level of syllable and stem.. A disyllabic stein, such as/begin/ would therefore have the structure in Figure 2 (over).","It should be noted that this analysis is distinct from most non-linear phonologies, which postulate fllrther levels of structure between the syllable and the stem, such as metrical feet. We maintain that these fllrther levels of analysis are not necessary for morphological description, although this is not to deny their role in phonological description.","With this kind of structure, we still need some way of referring to particular syllables within the stem, or segments within the peak, onset and coda. We achieve this by means of a simple numbering convention, where +N refers to the Nth element from the left, and -N refers to the Nth element from the right. In addition, +0 refers to the pre-initial position with respect to a sequence of nodes, and -O refers to the post-final position. This latter conven-tion is intended primarily for pre- and suffixation.","MOLUSC contains one basic operation, substitution. Conceptually, this means that affixation fimctions are regarded as substitutions of null elements with non-null elements, and deletion functions (\"subtraction\" in Matthews, 1974) vice versa. A substitution is expressed in the following form: [LtlS ~ RItS] where LIIS is an expression which specifies the node of a tree which is to be replaced and PdtS is an expression which specifies the subtree which is to replace it. The above function template consists of a single rule (LItS =~ RHS), each rule defining a substitution.

This can be defined as a swapping of the onset and coda of the final syllable with the use of variables, but the variables must both be instantiated before either of the functions apply.

The latter is treated as function composition since there can be no question of interaction in these cases as they affect different parts of the stem. The former is treated as conjoint application of functions, since the use of function composition would seem a misuse in a situation where only one of the functions could ever apply."]},{"title":"4 Some Examples","paragraphs":["There are a wide variety of different morphological functions which occur in language. This section will examine three in detail. The first of these is simple suffixation. Suffixation is the main function used in many European languages, and exa.rnples are numerous. We shall take the German example/ze:/- /ze:en/, \"See\" - \"Seen\", ('lake'-'lakes'). The basic function for describing sutfixation is: [(stem,-0) =:,/S/] where S is the suffix. This says, intuitively, \"the space after the stem is replaced with the suffix, S\".","The flmction required to define the alternation /ze:/-/ze:en/, then is: s mx_en = [(stem,-0) a /.e.n/]","The second flmction we shall look at is tt, e German mnlaut. The German umlaut is a classic example of a phonological process which ha~s become fossilized in the morphology. Once occurring as part of a vowel harmony process, it applied to stems, fronting a hack vowel when a suffix with a front vowel was added, to preserve vowel harmony. In modern German, vowel harmony is no longer a productive phonological process, but the umlaut remains, largely without any suffix, ms a morphological marker for plurality in some classes of nouns.","The description of the umlaut as the change from a vowel with the feature [+,back] to the corresponding vowel with the feature [-,back], is perhaps slightly misleading. Although with most vowels this is the case"]},{"title":"-/i/ --/y/, /o/ - /oe/,","paragraphs":["etc. - with the diphthong /ou/, the \"umlauted\" equivalent is /oy/, in which the second vowel is fronted, but the first is raised. This raising can be seen as a phonological assimilation process, leaving us to define the umlaut as the t'ronting of a vowel if it is the only vowel, the fronting of both vowels if the peak consists of a doubled (long) vowel, and the fronting of the second vowel only in a peak which is a diphthong. This can be expressed by means of the following functions: umlautl' = [(peak,?,--1)[+,back] ::~ [-,back]] umlautT = [(peak,?,-2)[+,back] => [-,back]",":(peak,?,-1)/V/,(peak,?,-2)/V/] the second of which says that the first vowel in a peak with two vowels is fronted only if it has the same value as the second vowel.","Tlle other problem with the umlaut is the syllable to which it applies. MOLUSC requires that a function be defined in terms of the syllable to which it applies, and this is one of the things which makes it a language for morphology rather than phonology. Phonological phenomena occur whatever tile syllable, provided only that the context restrictions arc satisfied. Morphological functions, we argue, although in other ways very similar to phonological ones, apply in a more restricted way to particular parts of stems, which we show by means of examples can be defined in terms of the representations described above.","Most German noun stems are monosyllabic, but those di-syllabic stems there are seem to divide fairly evenly betwcen those to which the umlaut applies to the first syllable and those to which it applies to the second syllable, as Table i shows. However, if we look more closely at this table, we can see that all those nouns which undergo umlaut on the first syllable, have the unstressed, neutral-vowelled/ou/, /a/ or /al/ as their second syllables. This might lead us to propose an analysis which rcquircs reference to 4 51 Nouns which take the umlaut Nouns which take the umlaut","on the first syllable on the second syllable Apfel"]},{"title":"I'apfal/","paragraphs":["Boden /'boodan/ Bruder /'bruuda/ Garten /'gaatan/ Hammer /'hams/ Laden /'laadan/ Ofen /'of0n/ Sattel /'zatal/ Ausflucht /'ausfluxt/ Auskunft /'auskunft/ Gebrauch /ga'braux/ Gewand /ga'vant/ Irrtum /'iatum/ Reichtum"]},{"title":"/'raixtum/","paragraphs":["Vormund /ffamunt/ Vorhang /!fahat.}/_ __ Table 1: Di-syllabie German nouns metrical feet, in order to specify that the stressed syllable takes the umlaut, but if we look again, we can see that in words such ms /iatum/ (\"Irrtum', 'error') and /raixtum/ (\"Reichtmn\", 'wealth'), the unstressed, but non-neutral-rowelled second syllable is umlauted. Thus, it would seem that the neutralness of the vowel is the deciding factor, not the stress. The functions required for the umlaut in German are thus,","umlautl = [(peak,+l,-1)[+,back] => [-,back]",":(peak,-1,+l)/o/]","umlaut2 = [(peak,+l,-2)[+,back] ~ [-,back]",":(peak,+l,-1)/V/,(peak,+l,-2)/V/,"]},{"title":"(peak,-1,+l)/o/] umla,ut3 = [(peak,-1,-1)[+,back] [/,back]]","paragraphs":["umlaut4 = [(peakc-l,Tg)[+,back] => [-,back] :(peak,-1,-1)/V/,(peak,-1,-2)/V/] Note that there is no need to specify\" the context in which the second syllable undergoes the umlaut, as any stem with /a/ in the second peak will be unchanged by the second two functions anyway, as/a/ does not have the feature [+,back].","Since there is no interaction between these fnnctions and only one is ever going to have any effect, we combine these with &, indicating conjoint appli.- cation, thus,","umlaut = umlautl & umlaut2 & umlaut3 g~ umlaut4","Finally, let us look at a more complex function - the partial reduplication found in Latin. This involves alternations such as /fal/ - /fefeli/, /kur/ - /kukuri/. For this we need two functions. The first reduplicates the whole of the first syllable, and the second deletes the initial coda. (that is, the coda of the reduplicative affix). This is necessary because we cannot reduplicate the onset and peak of the first syllable, as this is not a constituent in the structures we use. However, this analysis is actually quite attractive from a linguistic point of view, as it leaves us with two very natural functions - (reduplicative) prefixation a.nd consona.nt cluster reduction, a common phonological process.
