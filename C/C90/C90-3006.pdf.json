A new concept is that of \"personal MT\", or MAT for the writer.","MT for the watcher appeared in the sixties. Its purpose is to provide informative rough translations of large amounts of unrestricted texts for the end user.","MT for the revisor appeared in the seventies. It aims at producing raw translations good enough to be revised by professionals in a cost-effective way. This implies that the system needs to be specialized tor a certain sublanguage. For a system to be cost-effective, it is generally agreed that at least 20000 pages must be handled (e.g. 10000 pages/year for at least 2 years).","Leaving \"heavy MT\", not adapted to small volumes of heterogeneous texts, several firms have developed MAT systems for translators, in the form of tools (e.g. Mercury-Termex~), or of integrated environments (e.g. Alps TSSrU).","The concept of MT for the author (writer/speaker) has recently crystallized, building on previous studies on interactive MT, text critiquing and dialog structures [5, 6, 7, 9, 12]. Its aim is to provide high quality translation/interpretation services to end users with no knowledge of the target languages or linguistics.","A sccond classification of MAT systems is by the types of knowledge felt to be central to their flmctioning. Linguistic Based MT uses : core knowledge about the language ; specific knowledge about the corpus (domain, typology) ; intrinsic semantics (a term coined by J.P. Desclds to cover all information formally marked in a natural language, but which refers to its interpretation, such as semantic features or relations : concreteness, location, cause, instrument... ) ; but not : extrinsic semantics (static knowledge de~ribing the domain(s) of the text, e.g. in terms of facts and rules) ; situational semantics (describing the dynmnic situations and their actors) ; pragmatics (overt or covert intentions in the communicative context).","Knowledge-Based MT uses extralinguistic knowledge on top of linguistic knowledge. Finally, Dialogue-Based MT insists on extracting knowledge from a human (tile author or a specialist). These options are not exclusive, however. In KBMT~89 [7], for example, ambiguities persisting after using linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge are solved through a dialogue with the writer initiated by the \"augmentor\". In ATR's Machine Interpretation project, the dialogues center around a well-defined task (organization of international conferences), but may also concern extraneous matters (cultural events, health problems...). This feature, added to the enormous ambiguity inherent in speech input, will likely force such systems to be dialogue-baseA as well as knowledge-based [5]. Ii1 Personal MT, we may rely on some core extralinguistic knowledge base, but not on any detailed expertise, because the domains and types of text should be unrestricted. Hence, Personal MT must be primarily dialogue-based.","A third classification of MAT systems is by their internal organization (direct/transfer/interlingua, use of classical or specialized languages, procedurality / declarativeness...) through which so-called \"generations\" have been distinguished. This level of detail will not be too relevant in this paper. 30 1 ][, A project in Personal MT ILo G(~als","MDIA (Large Internationalization of the Documents by Interacting with their Authors) aims at studying the theoretical and methodological issues of the PMT approach, to be experimented on by first building a small prototype, and more generally at promoting this concept within the MT community.","We are trying to develop an architecture which would be suitable for very large applications, to be upscaled later with industrial partners if results are promising enough. For example, we don't intend to incorporate more than a few hundred or flmusand words in the prototype's (LIDIAol) dictionaries, although we try to develop robust indexing schemes and to imt)lcment the lexical data base in a way which would allow supporling on the order of 1 to lOMwords in 10 languages. The same goes for the grammars.","Even in a prototype, however, ttle sh'ucture of the dialogue with the author must be studied with care, and offers interesting possibilities. Clearly, the writer should be allowed to write freely, and to decide for himself when and on which part of his document to start any ldnd of interaction. But changes in the text should be controlled so that not all changes would torce the system to start the interaction anew.","From a linguistic point of view, it is extremely exciting to see, at last, a possibility to experiment with Zemb's theme/rheme/pheme \"statutory\" ,articulation of propositions [13], and/or Prague's topic/focus opposition, which are claimed to be of utmost importance for translation : both are almost impossible to compute automatically, because the tests are very often expressed in terms of possible transformations in a given discourse context. But, in PMT, we may ask the author. 2. Outline","The prototype system for LIDIA-1 is constrained as follows. Translation from French into Russian, German and English (inversing previous systems), with other target languages being studied in cooperative frameworks ; Small corpus from the Ariane-G5 user interface (containing some on-line documentation), in HyperCard form ; Distributed computer architecture : writer workstation on a Macintosh (Plus or SE), MT server on a mini (IBM-4361) ;","- Guided Language approach, as opposed to Free Text or Controlled Language ; Linguistic architecture : hybrid Trans fer/lnterlingua."]},{"title":"11yperText","paragraphs":["The choice of HyperCard reflects the fact that Hypertexts are becoming the favorite supports for technical documentation. It also relics on tile assumption that writers will more readily agree to participating in a dialogue if the tool they are using is very interactive than if they use a more classical text processor, t:inally, there are some linguistic advantages.","First, the textual parts are clearly isolated in fields, and not cluttered with images, formulas, tabs, markups, etc. Scripts should not be. translated -- if they generate messages, these must be taken from normal fields, and not directly generated (linguistic requirements may lead to better programming practices!).","Second, the textual parts may be typed, thus greatly facilitating analysis.

First, we want to use the Ariane-G5 system, a comprehensive generator of MT systems developed over many years [11]. Although some micros can support this system (PC~AT/370, PS2/7437), their user-friendliness and availability are no match to those of the Mac.","Second, looking at some other experiences (Alps, Weidner), we have concluded that some parts of sophisticated natural language processing can not be performed in real time on small and cheap machines without oversimplifying the linguistic parts and degrading quality down to near uselessness. Rather, it should be possible to perform the \"heavy\" parts in an asynchronous but still user-friendly way, as IBM researchers have done for the Critique system [9].","Of course, this idea could be implemented on a single machine running under a multitasking operating system, if such a system were available on the most popular micros, and provided tile heavy linguistic computations don't take hours."]},{"title":"Guided Language","paragraphs":["The \"guided language approach\" is a middle road between free and controlled text. The key to quality in MT, as in other areas of AI, is to restrict the domain in an acceptable way. 2 31","By \"controlled language\", we understand a subset of natural language restricted in such a way that ambiguities disappear.

In PMT, because of the necessity of lexical clarification, we should go one step further toward interlingua by relating the \"word senses\" of the vocabularies of all the languages considered in the system and making them independent objects in the lexical data base."]},{"title":"II.

Interactions concerning syntax, semantics and pragmatics","paragraphs":["Until now, the system has worked directly with the text as written by the author. For the remaining types of interaction, it will work on a transcription contained in the shadow record, as well as with some intermediate forms of processing stored in associated records of the shadow file.

Level five concerns"]},{"title":"the fixed forms.","paragraphs":["It is quite usual, especially in technical documentation, that some groups of words take a fixed meaning in certain contexts, with specific, non-compositional translations. For example, \"Save as\" as a menu item Saue as ... is translated in French as £nregislrer sous.., and not ~ts \"Sauver comme\", which would be correct for other uses. As a menu item, this group functions as a proper noun, not as a verbal phrase. The writer should be asked whether a given occurrence of each such group is to be treated as fixed or not. In the first case, an adequate transcription should be generated in the shadow record C&FXD_Save as\", for example). Certain elements (such as menu items) should be automatically proposed for insertion in the list. Level six concerns"]},{"title":"lexical clarification.","paragraphs":["First, polysemies are to be solved by asking the writer. For example, the word \"dipl6me\" is not ambiguous in French. However, if translating from French into English, 2 possibilities should be given : \"diplfme non terminal\" (\"diploma\") or \"dipltme terminal\" (\"degree\"). Some polysemies are source language specific, some depend on the target languages. We want to treat them in a uniform way, by maintaining in the lexical database the collection of all \"word senses\" Cacceptions\", not really concepts of an ontology as in KBMT-89), linked by disambiguating questions/definitions to the words/terms of the languages supported by the system.","Lexical ellipses can also be treated at that level. This problem is particularly annoying in MT. Suppose a text is about a space ship containing a \"centrale 61ectrique\" (\"electric plant\") and a \"centrale inertielle\" (\"illcrtial guidance system\"). The complete form is often replaced by the elided one : \"centrale\". Although it is vital to 32 3 disambiguate for translating correctly (by the corresponding elided forms: \"plant\"/\"system\"), no automatic solution is known. A given occurrence may be an elision or not. If yes, it is even more difficult to look for a candidate to the complete form in a hypertext than in a usual text.","At level seven, the unit of translation (the content of the shadow field) has been submitted to a first step of automatic analysis, which returns a surface structure showing ambiguities of bracketing (PP attachment, scope of coordiuation...).

The idea is to"]},{"title":"rephrase","paragraphs":["the input text itself, that is, to present the alternatives in suggestive ways (on screen, or using speech synthesis- see below).","Some other ambiguities, for instance on reference (unresolved anaphora) or syntactic functions (\"Which firm manages this office ?\" --where is the subject ?) might be detected at this stage. They may be left for the next step to solve (actually, this is a general strategy), or solved interactively at that point. In our view, that would best be done by producing paraphrases [Zajac"]},{"title":"1988],","paragraphs":["or by \"template resolution\""]},{"title":"[6].","paragraphs":["At level eight, the disambiguated surface structure has been .;ubnfitted to the deep analysis phase, which returns a multilevel structure (decorated lree encoding several levels of linguistic interpretation, universal as well as language specific). Some ambiguities may appear during this phase, and be coded in the structure, such as ambiguities on semantic relations (deep cases), deep acmalisation (time, aspect...), discourse type (a French infinitive sentence may be an order or not, ik~r example), or theme/theme distinction. Template or paraphrase resolution will be used to disambignate, as no rephrasing of the text can often suffice (e.g. : \"the conquest of the Barbarians\").","A suggestion of [6] was to delay all interactions until transfer. The view taken here is rather to solve as soon as possible all the ambiguities which can not be solved automatically later, or only with much difficulty. For example, word sense disambiguation takes place quite early in the above scheme, and that may give class disambiguation for free.","A more flexible scheme would be to ask about word senses eariy only if each lemma of the considered wordlkm~ has more t|:an one acceptkm, if ~mt, the system could wait until after surface a,m.lysis, which reduce~ almost all morphosyntactic ambi;!,t.'.ities.

Speech synthesis and Personal MT Speech synthesis and MT in general","paragraphs":["Speech synthesis of translations may be useful for all kinds of MAT. In MT for the watcher, people could access Japanese technical and scientific textual databases, for example, through rough English MT not only over computer networks, as is cm'rently done in Sweden [10], but also via the telephone. To produce spoken translations could be even more useful in the case of rapidly changing information (political events, weather bulletins, etc. disseminated to a large public through computer or telephone networks).","In the case of professional translation (MAT for the revisor or for the translator), the main area today is the translation of large technical documents. With the advent of wide!y available hypermedia techniques, these documents are starting to contain not only text and images, but also sound, used for instmme to stress some important warning messages.","Personal MT could be used for translating technical documents as well as all kinds of written material not relying on creative use of language (ioe. poetry). It could also be used for communication within multilingual teams working together and linked by a network, or by phone. Finally, it could be used for the multilingual dissemination of information created onoline by a monolingual operator (sports events, fairs...) and made accessible in written form (electronic boards, minitel) as well as in spoken form (loudspeakers, radio, telephone), whence the need for speech synthesis.

In the case of dialogue-based Machine Translation, however, an important part of the dialogue concerns variable elements, such as the translated texts or the dictionaries, where definitions or disambiguating questions could be inserted.","Speech in PMT : synthesis of input, texts or reverse translations","Speech synthesis of input seems to be required when producing a document in several languages, with some spoken parts. It would be strange that the source language documentation not have the spoken parts, or that the author be forced to read them aloud. In the latter case, a space problem would also arise, because speech synthesis can produce an acoustic coding (later fed to a voice synthesis chip) much more compact than any representation of the acoustic signal itself.","The concept of reverse translation could be very useful in PMT. The idea is to give to the author, who is presumed not to know the target language(s), some control over the translations. In human translation or interpretation, it often happens that the writer or speaker asks \"what has been translated\". By analogy, a PMT system should be able to translate in reverse. Technically, it would do so by starting from the deep structure of the target text, and not from the target text itself, in order not to introduce spurious ambiguities (although having both possibilities could possibly help in detecting accidental ambiguities created in the target language).","Note that speech synthesis of reverse translations might be ergonomically attractive, even if no spoken form is required for the final results (translations or input texts), because screens tend to become cluttered with too much information, and because reading the screen in detail quickly becomes tiring.","2. The need for very high quality speech synthesis in DBMT","It has been surprisingly difficult for researchers in speech synthesis to argue convincingly about the need for very high quality. Current text to speech systems are quite cheap and seem acceptable to laymen. Of course, it is tiring to listen to them for long periods, but in common applications, such as telephone enquiry, interactions are short, or of fixed nature (time-of-day service), in which case synthesis can proceed from prerecorded fragments.","DBMT, as envisaged above, seems to offer a context in which very high quality could and should be demanded of speech synthesis. Ergonomy","First, the writer/speaker would be in frequent interaction with the system, even if each interaction is short. The overall quality of speech synthesisdepends on three factors : voice synthesis (production of the signal from the acoustic coding) ; linguistic analysis (word class recognition, decomposition into groups), for correct pronunciation of individual words, or contextual treatment (liaisons in French) ; pragmatic analysis (communicative intent : speech act, theme/rheme division...), for pauses, rhythm and prosody.","We will consider the first factor to be fixed, and work on the linguistic and pragmatic aspects.","Of course, certain parts of the dialogue could be prerecorded, namely the messages concerning the interaction with the system itself. However, users might rather prefer a uniform quality of speech synthesis. In that case, these messages might be stored in the same acoustic coding format as the texts produced under linguistic control. Ambiguity resolution by rephrasing","We have seen two main ways of disambiguating structural ambig~tities ha DBMT, namely rephrasing and paraphrasing. Rephrasing means to present the original text in different ways. Suppose we want to disambiguate the famous sentence \"tie saw a girl in the park with a telescope\" by presenting the alternatives on a screen. We might get something like : 1- Hesaw 2- Hesaw 3- Hes~v 4- He saw 5- He saw the girl in the park with a telescope the girl in the park","with a telescope the girl","in the park with a telescope","the girl in the park with a telescope","the girl in the park","with a lelescope ~ 5 34","If the disambiguation happens orally, the spoken forms should be presented in the same register as in the original (here, affirmative), but very clearly distinguished, so that a human could reconstruct the forms above. The availability of complete linguistic structures is necessary, but not sufficient, because understandability is not enough : distinguishability is a new ~Zxluirement for speech synthesis. Other types of linguistic interactions","In disambiguation by paraphrasing or template generation (generation of abbreviated paraphrases, as it were), questions should be generated, with their locus clearly indicated by stress and prosody. For instance : Ls\" t~e girl or the parIc with a telescope ?","In the same manner, speech quality is very important if word sense dismnbiguation is done orally. Since some new words or new senses of existing words may be added by the user, the disambiguation processes should apply to their definitions in the same way as they do to the texts/ulterances to be translated.","All pr~eding remarks are of course even more valid in the case of oral input, where speech is the primary means of interaction, and the quality of the signal is mducect by the mmsmission channel."]},{"title":"Co~ch~sion","paragraphs":["The concept of Personal MT crysrtfllizes many kteas from previous systems and research (text--critiquing, interactive MT, dialogue-based MT, Machine Interpretation of spoken dialogues, controlled languages...). However, the perspective of interacting with the author, not requirexl to have any knowledge of the target language(s), linguistics, or translation, puts things in an original framework.","While the development of systems of this nature poses old problems in a new way, and offers interesting new possibilities to the developers, their acceptability and usefulness will perhaps result more from their ergonomy than from their intrinsic linguistic quality, how necessary it may be.","Promotion of the National Languages is becomi~g q~fite important nowadays, but, apmt of efforts to teach a few for~zigl~ langt~ages, no technical .~;olul:io~~ ires y(:t been proposed to help people write i~a mei~ ow~ lauguage and communicate with oilier people in ihcir own lang~ages.
