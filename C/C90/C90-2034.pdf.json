Jacobs","paragraphs":["Artificial Intelligence Program","GE Research and Development Center Schenectady, NY 12301 USA","psj acobs~crd.ge.com Abstract We have designed and implemented a text processing system that can extract important information from hundreds of paragraphs per hour and can be transported within weeks to a new domain. The system performs efficiently because it determines the level of processing required to understand a text. This \"skimming\" method identifies surface relations in the input text that are likely to contribute to its interpretation in a domain. This approach differs from previous skimming techniques in that it uses conceptual information as part of bottom-up linguistic processing, thus using linguistic knowledge more fully while limiting grammatical complexity. 1 Introduction Natural language systems that extract information from volumes of text have matured during the last several years. While these systems still operate in fairly limited domains, they can produce useful structured information from text with reasonable accuracy. Volumes of text information, low cost computing power, and scarce labor resources increase the motivation for using computers to manage information. The question that stands in the way of the widespread installation of text processing systems is \"Are they good enough yet?\"","Performance is a major issue in the evolution of text processing systems from \"toy\" research problems to real applications. In spite of the rapid advances in computing technology, most text processing systems are simply too slow, because applications and thorough testing both demand higher through-put. Excess grammatical complexity clearly accounts for much of the performance shortfall. Most computational methods of analysis overlook the human-like capability to \"skim\" texts, limiting computation to sections of importance.","Unfortunately, the \"skimming\" approach has come to be identified with systems that abandon grammatical knowledge as well as syntactic processing, thus sacrificing accuracy and other performance features. The ideal skimming system would need no less linguistic knowledge than a full syntactic parser; in fact, knowing what not to parse may require as much linguistic information as parsing itself. Our approach to skimming is relation-driven: the program makes a low-cost first pass through the texts, determining what conceptual relations could be relevant. Then it segments the text to limit grammatical analysis to sections that affect those conceptual relations. In sections of text with high information content, the program still performs a complete analysis. In other cases, the skimming technique leads to three types of performance improvements. The following examples illustrate these features in the context of SCISOR, a system that reads news stories about corporate takeovers [Rau and Jacobs, 1988]:","1. Skipping irrelevan~ text. Example: The company said it expects 1989 daily output to average 10,500 barrels of oil and liquids. Effect: Do not parse the sentence.","2. Limited processing of intervening phrases. Example: Fidelity Federal Savings ~ Loan Association said its board held a meeting on Dec. 2 and declined a proposal to amend the acquisition agreement by BEI Holdings Ltd. Effect: Parse to determine the roles of \"declined\" and \"acquisition\" only.","3. Limited attachment. Example: Revere said it had received an offer from an investor group to be acquired for $16 a share, or about $127 million."]},{"title":"Effect:","paragraphs":["Break the sentence into three sections to limit complexity.","In each of the above examples, relation-driven skimming limits processing by concentrating on information that. is necessary to satisfy the information requirements of the program, such as identifying the target and suitor of a takeover. In the first case, the program can skip an entire sentence because it does not contribute at all. In the second example, the sentence contains relevant information, but one clause (about the meeting of the board) does not really contribute. In the third example, the sentence is packed with relevant material, but the program can still limit grammatical complexity by discarding alternatives that do not contribute to semantic processing.","Relation-driven skimming is part of our text processing system, which has been applied to several prototype domains. The first accomplishment of the algorithm was to deliver a factor of six improvement in performance to SCISOR, which reads Dow Jones 19,4 i financial news stories at a rate of over 500 per hour. The same skimming program applied successfully to an evaluation set of naval operations reports used in the Message Understanding Conference (MUCK-II) held in San Diego in June, 1989 [Sundheim, 11990]. This paper will describe the relation-driven skimming algorithm and discuss the sort of performance improvements that can be expected from this approach.","2 The Text Extraction Task and the Skimrning Problem Skilrmling is of little use if the processing task demands a complete analysis. The skimming method presented here is aimed at the task of information extraction from text, where the program looks for relal;ively superficial facts that appear in texts with conslrained content. Since the program is looking only for certain key information, it should spend most of its time analyzing sections thal; contain that information. The more extraneous information there is in a text, the more skimming improves performance over full parsing.","The skirnmirig problem assunles that a text prc~ c~-;sing program works from set of predefined conceptual roles that represent some of the information from a t.ext. These conceptual roles forln a \"temo plate\" that the program fills in while scanning a text, The words \"relevant\", \"important\", and \"extraneo~s\" used throughout this paper describe the rela, tionship of portions of text to this template-filling task.","For example, the following is a l.ypical i)ow Jones m'w story, along with the template structure representing the ilaformat.ion extracted by SCIS()R: I]~put Text: th.uaswick Corp Up; Aclive amid Continued Takeover Talk","New ~)rk -D J- Traders and market sources say shares of Brunswick Corp., the world's largest Inanufaeturer of recreatioaal boats, are trading actively for the second consecutive week amid growing speculal, ion that someone is accumulating a post{ion in the company.

The problem for text skimming is thus (1) to identify sections of text that will contribute to information extraction, and (2) to limit processing in those sections. The introduction outlined three different types of pertbrmance improvements that come from skimming. 'l'he next section describes the relation-driven method and how it achieves these improvements. 3 Relation-Driven Skimming t{elation-driven skimming takes advantage of the the-ory that most conceptual information derives front linguistic relations that do not depend on a complete surface structure. Such relations, like subjeclpredicale and verb-complemenl, carry constraints such as agreement or selectional restrictions. Since the bulk of the complexity of most language analyzers comes from the combinatorics of parsing, finding relations without a complete syntactic analysis helps p (? r for Irl a, li ce.","The relation-driven skimming algorithm has three components:","® 73e coT~ccpl aclivalion component makes a first pass through the text and selects candidate concepts that may contribute to its semantic interpretation. The scgmc~zlalion compone~t tells the program what to parse, what to skip, and where to use seinantic inlbrmation for attachment.",", The allachmer, l cornpo'acnZ identifies linguistic relations in the input text that contribute to its semantic interpretation, even where segments have been skipped.","The trick to relation-driven skimming is to perform attachment as accurately as possible with as little grammatical analysis as possible. This is no simple task, because phrases with no relevant semantic content can always affect the attachment of relevant phrases. In the sections that follow, we will give for each of the components above an observation of why it works, its main activity, and an example or two of its operation. 3.1 Concept Activation Concept activation uses lexical analysis of words, combinations, and ()ther features to determine 2 i95 whether a portion of text is likely to be relevant. The concept activation component makes a single pass through the input text, producing a sequence of conceptual categories that may contribute to the conceptual interpretation.","Observation: The density of relevant content words in a section of text generally determines the degree of processing required for semantic analysis.","Activity: Divide content words into two categories: \"triggers\", or relation heads, and role fillers. Scan the text using domain knowledge for words or combinations that might be triggers, and for words or combinations that might be fillers.","Example: The following is the input text and output of concept activation for the Revere example:","Input: Revere said it had received an","offer from an investor group to be acquired","for $16 a share, or about $127 million.","Output: (Company) (receive-offer) (investor-group) (acquire)(dollar) (number) (share) (dollar)(number).","This process is more than a lexicM lookup. Some words, like rumor or target in the corporate takeover stories, are indeed \"triggers\" directly associated with important concepts. However, considering all words that might contribute to an important concept is in-efficient; words such as make, take, iss~te or increase require more analysis of the surrounding context. In these cases, the skimmer looks for combinations of words or concepts (such as received and offer above). This prevents the parser from doing a lot of processing around low-content words.","Whether a word is contentful or not depends on context. Some words, like plan, do not themselves carry much information but must be understood because they distinguish the agent of anot, her action. \"Acme rejects an offer\" and \"Acme plans an offer\" place Acme in different roles (i.e. the target and suitor, respectively). A concept like plan, therefore, appears in the list. of activated concepts only when there are takeover events in the local context.","Concept activation eliminates processing of unimportant sentences and clauses and helps efficiency in contentful sections, mainly by determining relations (such as role-filler) that help to guide syntactic analysis. The next phase, text segmentation, uses the results of concept activation to control parsing. 3.2 Text Segmentation The text segmentation phase groups the text around words that are concept activators, identifying noun groups and complement structures after verbs, and finding punctuation or words that separate segments of text. This phase determines (1) where to skip and (2) where to limit parsing.","Observation: It is generally possible to reconstucL the important relations of a text in spite of skipping over intervening words and phrases.","Aetivity: Skip over empty sentences and phrases, and break the combinatorics of parsing where a single parse will do.","Example: In the Revere example, the segmented (and marked) text is as follows:","Revere *skip* it }tad received an offer","from a.n investor group *break* to be ac-","quired for $16 a share *break* *skip* $127","million.","The *skip* token indicates to the parser that there is intervening information, while the *break* token indicates that it should \"reduce\" or complete all active linguistic structures. Both help to limit complexity-- skipping tends to avoid wasted parsing ~m well as the combinatorics of attachment, while the breaks help to avoid considering nmltiple attachments where syntax contributes little or no information.","The segmentation algorithm includes most important noun phrases, even when separation information prevents them from being attached. This is because, as in the above example, these noun phrases implicitly play a role in anaphoric references or infinitive phrases.","A side effect of text segmentation is to mark the original text, highlighting sections that are considered relevant. This has a dual effect: (1) It helps to debug the skimming algorithm by showing visually what sections of the text the program has read, and (2) It allows the users of the program quickly to spot key information.","For example, a typical merger & acquisition story from the Dow Jones examples will appear with relevant sections in boldface, as shown below: Mayfalr Gets Buyout Proposal","Maythlr Super Markets Ineo said that Stanley P. Kaufelt, its chairman, president and chief executive, has proposed a business combination with Mayfair in which the holders of Mayfair's out-standing common stock would reeelve $23.50 a share in cash. Text"]},{"title":"segnlentation","paragraphs":["confines processing to sections of text that contain important information. The correct semantic interpretation of these text sections often depends on correct syntactic attachment, as described below. 3.3 Attachment The attachment phase produces linguistic relations from the segrnented text. This phase is part of the bottom-up parsing process; the nmin difference be-tween attachment and full parsing is that the parser nmst attempt to form linguistic relations where it has skipped sections of text. Attachment in tile absence of a complete parse relies on rules that combine linguistic and conceptuM information; for example, \"a.ttach a verb phrase or infinitive to the most recent clause-level semanticly valid noun phrase\".","Observation: Attachments by default are much less costly computationally than attachments by exhaustive consideration of possibilities.","Activity: Prefer attachments within boundaries separated by breaks, and use semantics and recency to guide attachment otherwise.","Example: In the Revere example, the following relations guide the interpretation process: Revere received an offer... (NP-VP) an offer from an investment group (NP-PP) 196 3 Revere to be acquired... (NP-INFPHR.) acquired for $16 a share (VP-PP) $160 million (NP)","The combination of these simple relations permits the correct semantic interpretation without a complete parse (see [Rau and Jacobs, 1988] for a discussion of the use of these relations for analysis). In this example, the skimming algorithm reduces the number of parses considered by a factor of six. This is in spite of the fact that the R.evere sentence contains a fair amount of useful intbrmation; in less dense text the skimming program can sldp sentences entirely or extract only two or three relations from a complex sentence (as in the Fidelity exmnple given in the in-troduction).","The Revere example is more complex than most of the c~es that occur in these texts because it illustrates a number of interacting rules and preferences. It is, however, unusual in that flfll syntactic parsing of this example could be misleading because it would tend to attach \"to be acquired\" to \"investor group\" rather than \"Revere\". The point of this example is 7~0t, however, that flflI syntactic processing is bad, but rather that skimming can make the necessary attachments without full parsing. Complications of Limited Attachment","The attachment mechanism makes use of several heuristics for constructing relations fi'om the text, such as the infinitive phrase rule given earlier, resolving re.ferences before attaching pronouns, reconstructing sentences fl'om verb phrases in incomplete sentences, and determining voice before attaching conjunctive verb phrases. These rules have derived from the analysis of fairly large bodies of text. The following are some observations about the sorts of examples where \"limited attachment\" is necessary:","o Dangling Phrases. In many longer texts, prepositional phrases, infinitives, and other adjunct information \"hang off\" the ends of sentences. Typically, such phrases can be attached syntacticly to rnnltiple heads. The effect of the skimming algorithm is to give more weight to the semantic attachment of these phrases. Since many such examples contain temporal, spatial, or other information associated with events, this semantic attachment seems to provide an advantage over syntactic preferences.","o Conlunctive Clauses. Conjunctions introduce linguistic complexity. If only part of a conjunctive clause contains useful information, the program (:an identify a relation involving one portion of the coordinated clause without parsing the whole sentence. For example, one news story reads \"Investor William Farley...said he plans to seek a special meeting to discuss his proposal and to wage a proxy fight tbr control of the board\". Only the second clause contains useful information, although the first clause can help to attach the second. Negative h~.formalion. The skimming algorithm, in its application of linguistic relations, must use both positive and negative intbrmation in determining where to attach phrases. Lack of agreement, for example, can override the attachment of a verb phrase to a sernanticly valid subject. Case constraints often guide the analysis of pronouns. Semantic infbrrnation tends to provide positive information in these cases, while syntactic information provides negative information. Oddly, this is tile reverse of the more typical parsing strategy of using semantics to filter out invalid interpretations.","It might seem that these complications prcsent enough problems that it would be easier to perform full parsing than to try to derive new heuristics for attachment in all these examples. This is true in some cases, but the vast majority of examples we have encountered require only a few simple attachment preferences. In these \"easier\" examples, the performance payoff has been enough to keep us from degrading to :full parsing whenever possible.","4 Comparison with Other Approaches Most work in skimming or partial parsing [Deaong, 1979; Lebowitz, 1983; l,ytinen and Gershman, 1986; Young and Itayes, 1985] uses template-based or memory-based strategies, effectively using conceptual information in place of linguistic constraints. This approach seems to work in highly constrained texts where conceptual knowledge is sufficient tbr determining role relationships. In the domains that we have tested, the pure template-based approach fails because some role relationships are determined al-most entirely from linguistic intbrmat.ion such as complernent structure or agreement, l'br example, the target and suitor of corporate mergers are both companies; thus there is little conceptual information (other than the size of the companies) that helps to determine role-filling. In many classes of tactical operations reports, the agent and object are both military forces, thus correct linguistic attachmen~ is essential in this domain as well.","Although the overall parsing style of our system integrates template-based and language-based strategies [Rau and Jacobs, 1988], the skimming algorithm is actually more bottom-up or language-based. Like some of the other major text processing systems such as PI{OTEUS, PUNDIT, and qACH'US [tIobbs, 1986; Grishman and Ilirschmau, 1986], tile skimming program applies linguistic constraints and maps linguistic structures into conceptual roles. In these other systems, however, the bottom-up approach may cause the program to waste time on irrelevant sections of text. The difference is that these programs do not really use conceplual infof mation until after the parser has generated its candidate structures. The relation-driven sldmming process shortcuts bottom-up analysis by firs.t using conceptual knowledge to block some fi'uitless paths. As we have had the benefit of comparing our system in some detail with these other programs after operation on a common task, we believe that many such systems could achieve an order of magnitude improvement in processing speed by incorporating a similar method. 4 197"]},{"title":"5 System Status and Current Directions","paragraphs":["The SC[SOR system [Ran and Jacobs, 1988] was the initial testbed for this algorithm, is a completed prototype that reads news stories at the rate of about 500 per hour. It extracts certain key information from stories about corporate takeovers (typically about 10% of the texts), identifying target, suitor, purchase price, and other information with about 90% accuracy.","The generic text processing components of SCISOR, known as the GE NLToolset [Jacobs and Rau, 1990], are used in applications in the operations of GE. Our group applied this core of text processing tools, including the skimming procedures described here, to the MUCK-II task, which consisted of generating database templates from naval operations messages, during a period of several weeks before the conference. The skimming algorithm of the NLToolset was the key to producing good results so rapidly. The same text processing system has since applied to a number of message sets in other domains.","The improvements in speed from skimming have so far come without a degradation in accuracy. This does not, however, mean that the attachment heuristics are infallible. Clearly, examples can occur where text that has been skipped influences the attachement of key phra~ses, especially when texts contain ellipsis, anaphorie references, and complex coordinated structures. Future enhancements to our algorithm must refine the attachment rules for these cases, and degrade to full parsing where necessary."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Natural language text processing has reached a point where efficiency is a reM issue.
