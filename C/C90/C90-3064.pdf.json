The syntactic analysis is performed along classical generative principles, though with a deliberately simple output as a list of index-value doublets, which the semantic module pr(messes using methods in an object-oriented framework. The final representation is made of two types of object-centered structures : llrst, case-like, event level dated structures corresponding to the Input clauses; second, detailed representation of the culTent state of an agent of the reference world, plus rccords tbr tile follow-up of a task over time. Uncertainty, imprecision and prevision are handled using specialized fields. This framework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports in English."]},{"title":"I. Introduction","paragraphs":["The objective of the project is the processing of messages in English reporting the daily evolution of naval situation in the Mediterranean. The information extracted is exploited for situation monitoring, maintenance of a historical database, formulation of previsions, and detection of highlights and anomalies. A report typically gives information on the activity of one ship during the past 24 hours; for example: \"La Belle Poulc is performing oceanographical measurement in the northern Mediterranean, while moving south at a speed of 5 knots. La Belle Poule was approxinlately 40 nautical miles south of Ma.rseille at 10:00, April 14.\" This example exhibits discursive information on the c.urrcnt activity and movement of the ship and a spatio-temporal plotting relative to a reference location."]},{"title":"2.

IVhat is ~ted frorn s~jntact~a kncxvledge? There have been deeply contrasted positions on the role of syntax. It can be thought of as a full-fledged first stage, as an auxiliary which is sufficiently informative even when a complete syntactic structure per se (e.g. an x-barred tree) is not built (conceptual analysis : [Schank & Riesbeck 81]), as a co-process in close cooperation with semantics (since SHRDLU), as the first in an ordered sequence of increasingly costly means (as suggested by [Rau & Jacobs 87], who then list slot-filling involving filtering, heuristics when choices are to be made, and general domain knowledge). Grossly, syntax in itself carries information on : - constituent ordering and constituent relationship -flexion and syntactic function (if the grammar is relational). 13ut more actively, syntactic analysis backed by lexical semantics, even if less sophisticated than in LFG or Mel'cuk's model for example, can play an active part in sorting items out and ascribing them an adequate translation, as for prepositions with an identical meaning. In fact, besides applying weilformedness rules, the analyzer and lexicon can do some rearrangements so as to have the job all prepared for case attribution to function nicely."]},{"title":"4. Semantic processing","paragraphs":["The system first searches a clause for an action in the verb doublet or, if the verb has translated as \"empty\" (for verbs like \"perform\", conduct\"), in the tbllowing noun phrase. The field valuation mechanism of the object environment checks that the action value does belong to the declared domain. An instance of the action type is created, and the system fills its fields with the values it finds in the second element of the doublets; the condition on the first place [preposition) is expressed as a parameter. Domain checking is again performed. A case-like structure is obtained. When tile action instance has completed the valuation of its fields, it pours itself into an existing active task of the same ship if available, or else into a new task it creates. Temporary data {current 334 2 direction, destination, speed, company and goal) are replaced without testing if the new values are different. If the new action is an activity rather than a movement, it will either merge into the last recorded task If it is the same or a compatible one, or will generate a new task, If it is declared to be completed, it is (re-)written into the completed-tasks field after its status flag has been set to \"Inactive\". If it is incompatible with an existing ongoing task, that task is closed For all of the above, a new modality for an already valuated field will be checked against the existing modality : a \"better\" modality (e.g. certain vs probable} supersedes the previous one, whereas a worse one is anomalous and can be signalled. The processing of the above example thus results in the crcaetion/updating of the following frames :","Output lists : (<np,I.a-Belle-Pmfle>.<vp,empty>.<oceanographical met~smement>. <in,northern-Mediterraaean>).

Conclusion","paragraphs":["I have tried to show that objects are a convenient and efficient way to implement semantic representation as well as analysis in a reasonably small domain. Syntax based on a moderately strict set of well-formedness conditions and some initiative In renaming is an appropriate partner for such a semantic analyzer.
