From a descriptive point of view, it is desirable to be able to keep these different levels separate - conceptually ~ well ~s in the actual implementation of knowledge sources and representations of linguistic objects; such levels may include, for example, a description of morphological properties, of constituent structure, of predicate-argument structures or functional structures, as well as a description of textual and pragmatic properties.","In generation from semantic representations, constraints on the choice of linguistic realizations de-pend on properties of the basic elements of lexical and syntactic variants with respect to all these levels; such constraints usually interact in various ways.","Knowledge sources which provide the information necessary for modelling such phenomena should therefore allow for modularization as well as for","*Reseoxch reported in this paper is partly supported by the Gelanan Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT, Bundesminister ffir Forschung und Technologic), under grant No. 08 B3116 3. the declarative formulation of dependencies between information which belongs to different descriptive levels. 1.2 Current Approaches In research on MT and NL generation, different approaches to both problems, modularization and interaction between the modules, have been proposed.","Although most of these approaches allow for a description of linguistic phenomena at each individual level, it is hard for them to explicitly express interactions between levels without using directionality. Usually, adjacent levels are connected by explicit mappings. Conditions acting on nonadjacent levels often cannot be expressed directly: thus, information has to be carried explicitly across levels where it would normally not be stated. Moreover, as the input structure is transformed stepwise, the set of mappings has to be ordered carefully. Other generation researchers, like [DANLOS 1987]:96-99 and [NIRENBUtlG 1989]:242f have a similar view of the architecture of the linguistic description; most of their solutions to the above problem are based on a heuristic ordering of the mapping and on some loss of strictness in the separation of levels.","In order to alleviate such problems, the use of \"codescriptions\" h~u been proposed 1 which allows for statements about the coexistence of partial descriptions belonging to separate descriptive levels. This device makes all relevant information avait~ able in one place thus allowing for constraints from different levels to be considered at the same time. Although the use of codescriptions perfectly supports the formulation of interactions between different types of partial information, the current propos-","1See. e.g. [FENSTAD ET At,. 1987] who annotate contextfree rules of Lexical Functional Grammar with ftmctional as well as semantic descriptiotm, wlfich allows for the simultaneous construction of f-structures and situation schemata; an application to trmisfer has been proposed by [I(APLAN ET AL. 1989], where f-structures for different languages are simtdtm~eously built up. 102 1 als do not seem to pay enough attention to the separation <)f different types of information. In many cases, one of the types of information is assigned a predominant role (usually this is c-structure); all other information depends on it, i.e. cannot be expressed without making reference to the dominating information.","In this paper we propose an architecture of knowledge sources for multilingual genera.tion. It is based on linguistic descriptions in the format of typed feature terms following ideas of [Ai'T-KAcI 1986].

As to the level of detail down to which the conceptual description proceeds, it seems useful to stop decomposing concepts at a level where none of the languages to be treated has more specialized lexemes available. This allows to treat cases where languages differ with respect to the specialization level down to which they have lexemes. French and Italian, for example, do not have lexemes for the concept of \"transport-in-the-ai(', which makes it necessary to use the lexeme denot-ing a generic *transport*-action and to separately realize (in a prepositional phrase) the instrument: transporter des fleurs en avion de Nice a Berlin; trasportare fiori in aereo, da Nizza a Berlino. English and German, on the other hand, not only have lexemes for the generic concept, but also for the specialized one, namely lo fly slh. and etw. ftiegen, as in fly flowers from Nice to Berlin; Blumen yon Nizza nach Berlin fliegen. We therefore introduce a concept *fly*, defined as a subclass of *transport* with *airplane* as an instrument. 3.2 A lexical hierarchy In analogy to the semantic classification, we introduce a hierarchy of syntactic objects classified according to their syntagmatic properties; this allows for immediate access to information relevant for the realization of each lexeme.","We use a hierarchy of subcategorization types where \"monosemous readings\" of lexical units are classified. As an example, we discuss some characteristics of the organization of the French verbal subcategorization hierarchy. Although basically using fnnctional structures of LFG as syntactic representations, we do not only use LFG's grammatical function labels as a basic vocabulary 4. We also specify, among others, the phrasal category of the complement (NP, AP, finite or infinite clause, etc.), pronominalization possibilities (e.g. le, la, lee vs. en, y vs. lui, lent, etc.), and the presence/absence of prepositions. This decomposes grammatical ftmc-tions according to the distinctions relevant for their definition.

This is captured by a relation p on pairs of partial semantic and partial syntactic structures. The relation is specified as a feature term with top level labels SEM and SYN. The fact that many of the interactions between semantic and syntactic de,~criptions can be expressed for whole classes of structures is reflected by a modular and hierarchical specification of this relation.

So, for example p~enthuse relates the concept *enthuse* with the verbal lemlna enthousiasmer discussed in (l). The concept *enthuse* is defined as taking a *proposition* as its first ~trgnment. The lemnm enthousiasrner, however, selects only nominal-phrase type first complements. Consequently, subject clauses or subject in-finitives are ruled out for this verb, and among the realization possibilities for *proposition*s, only nominalizations can be used. 3.3.2 Using the relations in generation The use of the architecture of knowledge sources for different descriptive levels is best shown in an application where the interaction of constraints from different levels has to be treated: in the following example, collocational and syntactic (subcategorization) constraints interact.","For the realization of a simplified conceptual structure like (4), different English, French and German collocations such as (5)--(11) can be used; (4) *ENCOUNTER* [ARG2: *PROBLEM*J such as: (5) .t;,': the team encounlers a problem; (6) E: the leaT~ comes across a problem; (7) F: le troupe rencontre uu probldme; (8) F: le troupe bule eonlre un probl~me; (9) F: le troupe se heurle hun probl~me; (10) G: das Team"]},{"title":"st&l auf","paragraphs":["ein Problem; (1.1) G: das Team lrifft auf ein Problem.","The verbs used in (5) to (11) are collocationally p~:eferred.","The following statements relate the concept *encounter* with French and German lexemes, implicitly keeping track of the colloeational restrictions by listing only the possible collocates of problem and Problem, respectively: (12) p-f-ll :: SYN: {rencontre, V buter V se_heurter}J\""]},{"title":"(13)","paragraphs":["p~tg-ll := SYN : stossen.zuf","A simplified subcategorization description for the French and German verbs shows that they fall roughly into two classes, transitive and intransitive'~: French renconlrer (7) is described as transitive, taking a subject and an object and being passivizable.
