D.Lewis, for in-stance, used semantically interpreted phrase markers (roughly: syntax trees with logical formulas attached to the nodes) as meanings for natural language expressions ([Lewis 1972]).

Given that meanings are M-trees, the natural solution to the problem of \"de dicto\" propositional attitudes is to let epistemic attitudes denote a relation between an individual and an M-tree. Consequently, if a person x knows that S, while S' and S share the same M-tree, then x is predicted to also know that S ~.

The general situation is that if x knows that S and S ~-M S\", then it is predicted that x also knows that S H.","Natural Language Generation. Even outside the domain of automatic translation, M-trees can be used for naturM language generation. For example, in a natural language question-answering application, the M-tree derived from the input-question can serve as a basis for generation, after some operations on the original M-tree, in which a yes-no question is changed into an affirmative or negative answer, for instance. In most applications where there is no M°tree available, other means than M-trees can be used. For instance, when the user of a query system asks as-sistance from the computer's help facility, pre-stored natural language text can replace M-trees.","Mixed Inference.
