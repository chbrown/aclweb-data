M. van I toof (FhG-IAO,Stuttgart,FRG) INTRODUCTION. In our contribution for COLING 88 (1III '88), we introduced the concept of dialogical failure in the framework of dialogue games, by defining rules for the operator F, where FA is to be interpreted as \"A is not winnable in this stage of the dialogue\". We showed that F can be employed in the formulation of provisional implications. Provisional implications can be considered as the dialogical interpretation of defaults.It was shown that our solution works well for a range of examples. We concluded our paper with the announcement of a treatment of counteffactuals in terms of dialogical failure and of an implemented theorernprover for conditionals and counteffactuals based on our the-oretical developments.In this note we will briefly describe the considerations: leading to our treatment of counteffactuals and introduce the implementation of a theoremprover for conditionals as a sub-system of PROLOG. For a more detailed description of the formal properties of the system we refer to (ttli.91).","I. A DOUBLE CIIANGE OF LOGICAL ROLES","1.

Tichy (T.84) shows that none of the prominent theories on counteffactuals is successfull on all members of a set of mostly very plausible testeases, and wonders why it is, that in settling the validity of a counterctual, nobody ever refers to such matters as world similarity and other well known paraphernalia of traditional counteffactual theory. We take seriously Tichy's suggestion to look for the use of counteffactuals and formulate a semantics for counteffactuals not in terms of \"troth\" and \"falsehood\", but rather in terms of what is done and not done in a dialogue in which a counterfactual appears. One thing which simply is qmt done\" when discussing a eounterfactual is the following: Suppose you forward the thesis \"if kangaroos had no tails, they would topple over\" (I.73) to somebody who has already admitted that kangaroos do have tails. Suppose your adversary accepts the invitation to discuss, and takes the antecedent of the counterfactual as a temporary additional concession. Then it would be completely out of order Ibr you to claim to have won the the discussion on the ground that your adversary has now \"contradicted\" himself.tlowever, if contradicting oneself - as an opponent - in a discussion is no longer a reason for losing that discussion, then we seem to be playing according to roles which are similar to those for minimal calculus. Define negation as implication of some absurd statement, eg. a contradiction, \"%\": 2.-'A= A-> % In intuitionistic and in classical logic the proponent who utters the absurd statement loses against any thesis whatsoever. Not so in minimal calculus: here the opponent, having uttered the absurd, loses only if he, in a later move, attacks the absurd brought forward by the proponent. However, counteffaetuals cannot simply be treated as implications in minimal calculus: Suppose Jones steps on the brake (B), and is \"alive (A), and that is all we assume or admit. We will not accept the counteffactual \"If Jones would not step on the brake, then he would not be alive\" as winnable (i.e. holding) under these circumstances. But in minimal calculus we have","3.
