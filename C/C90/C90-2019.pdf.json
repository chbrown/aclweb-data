Intr~cluction","In this paper, we describe the linguistic solutions to some of the problems encountered in writing a reversible French grammar. This grammar is primarily intended to be one of the components of a machine translation system built using ELU, 1 an enhanced PATR-II style unification grammar linguistic environment based on the LID system described in Johnson and Rosner (1989), but it is also part of our more general experimentation with fully reversible grammars.","The requirement that it be reversible imposes a stringent criterion of linguistic adequacy on a grammar, siuce it is not allowed to overgenerate while it must at the same time provide a large coverage for analysis (Dymetman and IsabeUe (1988)). Formally, grammars that are fully reversible must be completely declarative, since no reierence can be made in the grammar rules to the process (analyzer or synthesizer) which will use them. The unification formalism makes itt possible to write such grammar statements, because due to the associativity and commutativity of the unitication operation, the result of unifying feature structures is independent of the order in which they are unitied (Appelt (1989)).","Writing reversible grammars, however, presents problems which do not arise in the traditional grammars used for either analysis or generation. In addi-tion, the progress accomplished recently in building generators for unification grammars has already revealed some of the problems posed by unification-based reversible grammars. 2 As shown by Russell et al. (1990), even though the grammar rules do not refer to the generation process, the generation algorithm imposes particular constraints on the grammar formalism. 3","This paper concentrates particularly on the problems encountered in the generation of French, specifically in the analysis to be given to clitics.","1 ELU stands for Environnement Linguistique d' Unification.","2 See Dymetman and Isabelle (1988), Shieber (1988), Shieber et al. (1989), van Noord (1988), inter alia.","3 For instance, we cannot compare our grammar with the one pre~;nted in Saint-Dizier (1989), since his grammar is neither reversible nor purely declarative, as the rules are annotated with ' generation points'.","We first briefly describe the aspects of the generation algorithm and of the grammar formalism which are relevant to the particular problems under discussion, then present the facts of French syntax which pose those problems and the solutions we have adopted. 1. The Generator","The generation algorithm of ELU is based on the algorithm described in Shieber et al. (1989) and was developed at ISSCO by J. Carroll. 4 Generation is head-driven: each role has a \"semantic head\" (see Shieber (1988)), which is specified by the ~ammar writer, and the head daughter of a rule is generated before its siblings. The depth-first algorithm defines a downward path through the semantic heads of rules.","This algorithm does not require that the grammar be semantically monotonic. Non-monoto]tficity is obtained by having the generator distinguish two types of rules in the grammar, \"chaining\" arKl \"non-chaining\" rules, and by introducing the notion of \"pivot\". Following from this distinction, it employs both bottom-up and top-down processing.","The partition of the set of grammar rules into chaining and non-chaining rules is pre-compiled from the specification of what counts as the \"semantics\" of a feature structure. In a chaining rule, the mother and the head daughter have identical semantics; chaining rules are used bottom-up from the \"pivot\", which is defined as the lowest point in the path through the head daughters of chaining rules at which the semantics of the feature structure remains unchanged. In a non-chaining rule, the mother and the head daughter have different semantics; non-chaining rules are used top-down from the pivot.","The efficiency of the ELU generator depends in a large part on the restrictors defined by the grammar writer. Computing the pivot, i.e. creating a teachability table for chaining rules, and bottom-up processing","4 Cf. Russell et al. (1990) for a description of the differences between the two algorithms. 106 1 are both controlled by pre-compiled \"linking\" inforo mation, which is encoded as sets of restrictor values. A restrictor is a specification of a value wlfich can be computed from a feature structure (syntactic category, for example, is often defined as a resUictor). Before attempting unification between two feature structures, the values tbr the restrictors are checked in both of them; if these values are not compatible, unitication would be bound to fail mid is not tried. As linking information is only relevant for chaining rules, it is only used bottom-up during processing, ~md since by definition, chaining rules have the same semantics for their heads, linking information must be syntactic. Restrictors are also used heavily m the selection of lexical items, so the attributes chosen as restrictors have to be good discriminauts between i~ature structures. 5","\"Ihe generation algorithm by itself guarantees neither the completeness nor the coherence of tile resulting feature structure. The responsibility tbr prevent° ing the generation of structures which unify with the input, bu~ me incomplete (i.e. ensuring completeness) rests with the grmnmar writer: any structure which needs to be generated in its entirety should not be represented as an uncotx~trained ti~ature structure, but must be specified as another data type, i,e. a list, a tree, or a user-defined type expression. Tt~e graulmar writer and the generator share tile responsibility for preventing additions to the input structure (i.e. preserving coherence): the gramm~ writer must again select the appropriate data types, and the generator \"tTcezes\" uninstantiated variables that occur in the input.","The choice of appropriate data types as well as of good restrictors is therclore crucial to ensure flint the grammar is not only efficient but usable in generation. 2. The G, rammar Formalism.","The syntactic ieplesentations built by file parser are trees where each node is a directed acyclic graph consisting of atuibute-value pairs (i.e. a feature struc~ ture which allows reentrancy). 'File semantic represemations used ~s input by the generator are feature structures derived from the syntactic trees.","The gr~unmar rules consist of context-free phrase structure rules annotated with corrstraint equatiotrs expressing relations between the categories mentioned ill the rule. The ELU tormalism provides a generalization of the template facility of PATR-II, the \"relational abstractions\", which are statements abstracting over sets of constraint equations. These statements","5 Restrictors are also used to restrict the search space in parsing (see Shieber (1985)). \"fbe use of linking information in generation was first proposed by van Noord (1988). may receive multiple and mcursive definitions. To give multiple definitions to a relational abstraction permits collapsing what i~l an unextended PATR-Iike formalism would be several distinct rules, and is a powerful way to capture linguistic generalizations. Multiple definitions, however, give rise to a high degree of non-determinism during processing. Therefbre, while the parser expands multiple definitions whenever they are encountered, the generator uses a lazier approach and only expands them when they are needed. Nevertheless, tiffs strategy is not sufficient, and the problem posed by the non-determinism of relational abstractions is the most complex and severe of the grammar/generator interactions described in Russell et al. (1990), because of its adverse effects on the restliclion of top-down generation. 3. French Critics","Any French gr~wnmar must account for the posi-tion aid ordering of preverbal clitics. While full complement aud modifier ptwases occur to tile right of the mah~ verb of a clause, up to three elitics may occur in front of a verb, as in (1).

Je veux deux de ces pommes]","[I want two of these apples] The contrast between (5.a) and (5.b) shows that a elitic can either be subcategorized or not.

I1 dormait souvent dans cet hdtel]","[he often slept in that hotel]","Besides the personal pronouns and the adverbs given in Table (3), there are other lexical items which are not usually considered in the treatment of French clitics, but whose behavior is closely related. 7 The negative elements pas, plus, jamais, rien, and the quantifiers tant, autant, plus, moins and tout 8 also cliticize and may appear preverbally.","While ,all the clifics of Table (3) must appear in front of the traditional AUX constituent (i.e. before any of the verbal elements of the VP), the examples in (6) slhow that the elements of this second set appear inside AUX, more precisely after the first tensebearing verbal form.

Je n'y en ai jamais autant vu.","I had never seen so many of them there","7 They are, however, the subject of work in theoretical linguistics, see e.g. Perlmutter (197l), Emonds (1975), Kayne (1975), and more recently Pollock (1989). Interestingly, though it was developed in a different framework and for different reasons, our treatment of those elements is compatible with the latter's analysis (cf. also fn.9).","8 The quantifier tout has actually several forms, inflected for gender and number: tout/tousltoute/toutes.","There are thus at least two slots for clitics inside a French VP, and neither of these slots correlates with argumenthood. The quantifiers rien and autant which appear inside AUX in (6.b) and (6.c) are (paJtts) of the argument of the verbs croire and voir, and so is the quantifier en, which is in front of the AUX. On the other hand, the adverb y is not an argument in (6.c), nor is jamais in (6.a-c).","Therefore, the lexical entry of every clitic element must specify not only that it is a clitic but whether it appears in front of or inside the AUX constituent. 4. Generation","Theoretically, the fundamental problem posed by clitics stems from their dual nature, syntactic' and morphological, and partly consists in deciding whether to treat them by syntactic or by morphological processes. 9","Descriptively, there are three issues to be addressed: argument-binding, linear ordering relatior~s, and categorial status of the clitics. All three give rise to problems in generation due to non-determinism, for which the solution is to ensure that the lexical verb is instantiated as soon as possible."]},{"title":"4.1. Subcategorizatlon","paragraphs":["The unification formalism makes it very natural to encode syntactic information in the lexicon and with a lexicalist approach, our treatment of arguments is straightforward: we make the standard use of a subcategorization list to encode the complements a verb requires.

More recently (Rizzi and Roberts (1989), Kayne (1990)), the question has been reformulated in terms of the type of mechanism (adjunction or substitution) involved in cliticization and of whether clitics are phrasal heads or not. With the lexicalist approach adopted in our grammars both types of processes can be referred to in the lexicon, but it is of course still desirable that the two be clearly separated.","l0 This analysis contrast with that of Baschung et al. (1987), or B6s et al. (1989), which treats separately complements appearing to the left and complements appearing to the right of the verb. Their reason for doing so is that they take the variants shown in (i) and (ii) to indicate a relatively free order of complements (sulx-ategorized or not) in French.","(i) il a donn6 (hier) un livre ~t Marie (hier).","yesterday he gave a book to Marie","(ii) il a donn6 (hier) ?l Marie un livre (bier).","yesterday he gave a book to Marie While the ordering of full complements inside the VP poses some problems for generation, it is a separate question from that of cliticization, and the two should receive principled solutions of their own. 108 3","During analysis, art element found in the VP is checked against Subcat, the subcategorization list of the predicate. If it does not unify with any element of Subcat, ~t is treated as a VP modifier and added to Mods, the list of modifiers. From the point of view of generation, clitics realize elements from either the Subcat list or from the Mods list.","For instance, we partly follow the lexicalist analysis of Grimshaw (1982) for the R-clitics represented by se. That is, we consider that the R-clitic is not an argument of \"iuheienfly reflexive\" (7.a,b) and \"middle\" verbs (7.c), but a morphosyntaclic marker, t i (7) a. i~1 s'est 6vanoui.","he fainted","b. I1 se le demandait.","he was wondering about it","c.

Ils se sont regardds.","they looked at each other~themselves","b. Ils se les sont donnds.","they gave them to each other~to themselves Thereibre, because the verbs in the examples of (7) are marked in the lexicon as being iitherently reflexive, an R-clitic is generated from Subcat without being bound to the list of semantic arguments. In (8) on the other hand, the verbs are respectively transitive and ditransitive: in their case, a semantic argument is both bound to ,an element of Subcat and re,alized as a reflexive pronoun because of its own semantic features. In (9.a-c) se is, as in (7), the inherent reflexive marker mid is generated from Subcat. In (9.a) en is the partitive phrase of a subcategorized argument; y in (9.b) is a subcategorized locative argument from Subcat and in (9.c), it is a VP adverb from Mods. (9) a.

Subcategorization lists are relational abstractions with multiple definitions; therefore, they introduce non-detenninism in tile expansion of the rules in which they are invoked. Moreover, they exemplify the type of syno tactic information typically found ill lexical entries; tiffs infommtion is not available to the generator until the lexical head has been instantiated, but if it was avMlable at a higher point in the path through the rules it would help constrain the top-down search.","In particular, here, separating the elements found inside the VP into arguments and modifiers can only be (lone alter the lexical head has been instantiated mid its subcategorization list is available. As shown by the two meanings of the verb trouver given in the lexical entries (10.a,c) and exemplified in (10.b,d), the semantics of the verb (its argument list) may change according to its subcategorization list.

Even though the two possiblities ,are mutually exclusive, if the subcat list is not available at the VP level, the search must proceed top-down and tim VP is expanded top-down and non-deterministically. Recall that when the semantics for the head daughter of a rule does not change, the rule is a chaining rule which is used bottom-up, but if the semantics of the head changes, then the rule is a non-chaining rule, which is used top-down and defines a pivot. 4.2. Linear ordering","As was shown by the examples of (2), the linear ordering among preverbal clitics is independent of their semantics; it is also independent of the syntactic features of their dominating clause, i.e. negation, inversion, etc, A perspicuous way to express citric ordering is to have one relational abstraction with separate definitions stating the different precedence constraints holding between two preverbal clitics. The simplified definitions for Precede(C1,C2) given in (11) would account for most of the distribution 4 109","facts of Table (3) in a natural and elegant way. 13","(11) Precede(C 1 ,C2)","<C1 head morph pers> = 1/2","<C2 head morph pers> = 3 Precede(C1,C2)","<C1 head morph case> = acc/refl","<(.'2 head morph case> = dat Precede(C1,C2)","<C1 head morph case> = refl","<C2 head morph case> = acc]dat Precede(C1,C2)","<C1 head sem pred> = y","<(~ head sem pred> = en","4.3. Categorial status A characteristic property of clitics is that they do","not have a maximal projection and remain X ° consti-","tuents, with their own syntactic category feature com-","ing from the lexicon. To express the fact that a dative","pronoun or the clitics y and en actually stand for a PP","can be done by building a PP in the lexicon, e.g. with","a relational abstraction such as Make-PP(CI,PP).","(12) Make-PP(CI,PP)","<CI head sem pred> = \"y/en","<CI head morph case> = dat","<PP head sere pred> = ~t","<PP head sem args> = [<CI>] Make-PP(CI,PP)","<CI head sem pred> = y","<PP head sere pred> =","<PP head sem args> = [<CI>] Make-PP(CI,PP)","<C1 head sem pred> = en","<PP head sere pred> = de","<PP head sere args> = [<CI>] The relational abstractions Precede and Make-PP","constitute an elegant collapsing of syntactic and lexi-","cal rules which is useful in analysis: the grammar","rules which rewrite VPs containing clitics need not","specify all the various possibilities.

In an analysis reminiscent of current work in the Government-Binding framework, 14 where a clause is IP (Inflectional Phrase), the maximal projection of INFL, we take as the semantic head for our rules the element which bears tense. This element, I, may be either the main verb or an auxiliary which takes the main verb as complement.","With this analysis of the structure of VP, the semantics of the head daughter I remains the same along the path through the semantic heads so that the pivot of the structure, i.e. the point at which bottom-up generation can start from, is at the end of path. At that point, either I is the main verb (V-raising has applied) and it can be instantiated immediately, or I is an auxiliary (V-raising hasn't applied) and the main verb is its sister, which can be reached through other chain rules.","We can deal with clitics in two ways: • by successive adjunction to the head: (13) TP"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["el TP"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["cl TP","• by building a list, itself adjoined to the head:","(14) TP / \\ CL TP"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["cl cl Besides being descriptively more adequate, since the ordering constraints hold between the clitics themselves, not between a clitic and a verbal constituent, the second approach is to be preferred because a list ensures completeness of the resulting feature structure.
