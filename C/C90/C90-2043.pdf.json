Idioms are multi-lexemic expressions, the meaning of which is a property of the whole expression.","1cf. Wood (1986): an idiom is 'wholly non-compositional in meaning'. 1 245 Some attempts have, however, been made to assign the meaning of an idiom to the parts of the idiom. These can roughly be divided in two: - assignment of the idiomatic meaning of the expression to one of the parts of the idiom, and no meaning to the other part (Ruhl, cited in Wood 1986). In the case of kick the bucket, the meaning die is assigned to kick, and no meaning to the other part. This raises the question however, why one cannot say Pat rested the bucket to mean Pat rested (Wasow et al. 1983). - assignment of idiomatic interpretations to all parts. Compositional combination of these meanings results in an idiomatic meaning for the whole expression (Gazdar et al. 1985). This analysis has a number of problems. G~dar et al. use partial functions to avoid combination of an idiomatic functor with a non-idiomatic argument, but do not explain how to avoid combination of a non-idiomatic functor with an idiomatic argument. In our view this can only be solved by introducing partial arguments, to our knowledge a non-existing notion, or by accepting that all functors are partial, which is not common in linguistics. We conclude that the meaning of an idiom is a property of the whole expression, and should be represented in the lexicon. 2"]},{"title":"3.2 Psycholinguistics","paragraphs":["The same observation arises from psycholinguistic research. Idioms are stored and accessed as lexical items, not from some special list that is distinct from the lexicon 3 (Swinney and Cutler 1979). Furthermore, idioms are stored as holistic entries in the mental lexicon (Swinney and Cutler 1979; 'Lancker and Canter 1980; Lancker, Canter and Terbeek 1981; cf. the notion 'configuration' in Cacciari and Tabossi 1988)."]},{"title":"4 Processing idioms","paragraphs":["Phrases consisting of idioms can in most cases be interpreted non-idiomatically as well. a It has however frequently been observed that very rarely an idiomatic phrase should in fact be interpreted non-idiomatically (Koller 1977, p. 13; Chafe 1968, p. 123; Gross 1984, p. 278; Swinney 1981, p. 208). Also, psycholinguistic research indicates that in case of an ambiguity, there is clear preference for the idiomatic reading (Gibbs 1980; Schweigert and Moates 1988). We will refer to the fact that phrases should be interpreted according to the idiomatic, non-compositional, lexical, conventional, meaning, as the 'conventionality' principle. 5 If this principle could be modeled in an appropriate way, this 2Although other opinions exist (Pesetsky 1985). gAs has been defended by Bobrow and Bell (1973). 4Exccptions are idioms that contain words that occur in idioms only (spin and span, queer the pitch), and ungrammatical idioms (trip the light fantastic). SThe same can be observed for compounds: these are not interpreted compositionally, but according to the lexical, conventional meaning (Swinney 198 | ). would be of considerable help in dealing with idioms: as soon as the idiom has been identified, the ambiguity can be resolved and 'higher' processes do not have to examine the various analyses. There is one more issue, that requires some consideration: when can and does an incremental processor start looking for idioms? From psycholinguistic research it appears that idioms are not activated when the 'first' (content) word is encountered (Swinney and Cutler 1979). There is, from the computational point of view, no need to start 'looking' for idioms, when only the first word has been found 6: that would result in increase of the processing load at higher levels. Stock In Stock's (1989) approach to ambiguity resolution, firstly, the idiomatic and the non-idiomatic analysis are processed in parallel. An external scheduling function gives priority to one of these analyses. Secondly, Stock starts looking for idioms when the 'first' word has been encountered. As we have stated, both increase the load on higher processes."]},{"title":"5 An extension of the notion continuation class Lexicai representation","paragraphs":["Lexical entries in two-level morphology are represented in a trie structure, which enables incremental lookup of strings. A lexical entry consists of a lexical representation, linguistic\" information, and a so-called continuation class, which is a list of sublexicons \"the members of which may follow\" (Koskenniemi 1983, p. 29) the lexical entry. In the continuation class of an adjective, one could for instance find a reference tO a sublexicon containing comparative endings (ibid. p. 57). An obvious extension is to apply this notion beyond the boundaries of the word. A continuation class of an entry A could contain references to the entries that form an idiom with A.

The model (2) consists of four levels. Units at the lowest level represent the smallest units of form. These units activate units on the level that represents syntactic discriminations, which in turn activate units on the semantic level. The semantic features activate relational nodes in the semantic network. Within levels, inhibitory links may occur; between levels excitatory links may exist. However, there are no inn hibitory links within the semantic network. The meaning of idioms is represented as all other relational nodes in the semantic network. On the level of semantic features, the idiom is represented by a unit that has a gate function similar to so-called SIGMA-PI units (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986, p. 73): in order for such a unit A to receive activation, all units excitating A bottom-up should be active. If one of the units connected to a unit A is not active, A does not receive activation. Thus when lhe first word of an idiom is encountered, the idiom is not activated, because the other word(s) is (are) not active. However, once all relevant lexemes have been encountered in the input, it becomes active. Note that an external syntactic module excitates one of the nodes in case of syntactic ambiguity. Since there is more than one syntactic unit activating the idiom, the overall activation of the idiom becomes higher than competing r~odes representing non-idiomatic meanings. Or, to put it differently, the idiom represents the simplest hypothesis that accounts for the meaning of the lexemes in the input.","7For all introduction to conncclionist models, see Rumclhart a.d McClelland (1986); for a critical evaluation see Fodor and Phylyshyn 0988). The idiom is the strongest competitor, and inhibits the non-idiomatic readings. Without need for feedback from outside the model, the conventionality principle is thus modeled as a natural consequence of the architecture of the model. The connectionist model has been implemented in C with the use of the Rochester Connectionist Simulator (Goddard et al. 1989). In the appendix we give a description of technical details of this implementation."]},{"title":"7 Concluding remarks","paragraphs":["Ambiguity in the case of idiomatic phrases can be resolved on the basis of the conventionality principle. When compared to strategies as used in Stock (1989), both models presented here have the advantage that they don't process idioms until all relevant lexical material has been encountered in the input and operate in a best-first fashion. Therefore they contribute to the efficiency of the parsing process. The conneetionist model has one further advantage: the conventionality principle results naturally from the architecture of the model, and does not have to be stipulated explicitely. The obvious disadvantage of this model is the necessity for parallel hardware for realistic implementations. Future research will include the true integration with a syntactic module. Then, it will also be able to take the precise syntactic form of idiomatic phrases into account."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Walter Daelemans and the visitors of the Colloquium \"Computer and Lexicon\" 12 & 13 Oct, 1989, Utrecht for their useful comments.

An ideal IAC network consists of nodes that can take on continuous values between a minimum and a maximum. The activation of the units is also supposed to change only gradually in time. This ideal is approximated by dividing time into a series of small steps. If we choose an activation function that cannot change very rapidly this discrete model acts as a good approximization for the ideal IAC-network.","The network (Figure (2)) consists of a set of nodes that are connected with links which can be excitatory or inhibitory (with a negative weight value). Some units can receive external stimuli, e.g. input from the syntactic module. The internal structure of a unit is shown in Figure (3). The input links are connected to a site that corresponds to their type. So each unit has distinct sites for external, excitatory and inhibitory links. The gate unit also offers a separate gate site with a special site function.","The site functions for the external, excitatory and inhibitory links simply compute the weighted sum of the input values Iv."]},{"title":"Sv = ~ wiIvi","paragraphs":["The site function for the gate site is a kind of\"weighted AND\" function. Its behaviour is similar to the weighted sum function when all input links have a value different from zero. However if one of the input links connected to the gate site is zero, the output Sv of the gate site function is also zero. The output of each site is scaled in order to control the intluence of the different sites on the activation value. Ne~input = ScinhSvi,~h + Sc,zcSvezc +Sc~=t Sv,zt + Scgat, Svo,~t~ The activation value Av for a new timestamp t can now be computed: When Netinput is larger than zero: Av t = Av t-l -4- (maz - Avt-1)Netinput _decay(Av t- 1 _ vest) When Netinput is less than zero: Avt = Av t- 1 + (Av t- 1 _ min)Netinput _decay( A v t- 1 _ ves~ ) We see that the influence of Netinput on Av decreases when Av reaches its minimum or maximum value. On the other hand the influence of the decay rate is high in the upper and lower regions. When Netinput becomes zero, the Activation value slowly decreases to its rest value. The output value of the unit is equal to its activation, but only if the activation level is above a predefined treshold value. Otherwise the output is zero. So a unit with maximum activation that does not receive input anymore, slowly decreases its output value and than suddenly drops to zero beacuse its activation is below treshold value. This non linear behaviour is at~ essential property of connectionist models.","The bottom-up links are stronger than the top-down links because a unit may only be activated by bottom-up evidence. Top-down information may however influence the decision process at a lower level. The values of the parameters in the model are: Sci,,h 0.6 Se,,c 0.6 Sc,,t 0.6 Scaat~ 0.6 treshold 0.5 decay 0.1 bottom-up weights 0.8 top-down weights 0.25 inhibitory weights -0.8 external input weights 1.0 max 1.0 min -1.0 rest 0","A simulation consists of a number of cycles in which activation spreads through the network. In each cycle the output and activation values for a time t are calculated from the values on time t-1. Figure (4) and (5) show the activation levels of the active units in the model: only activation levels above treshold (500) are displayed. At the beginning of the simulation all units are in rest state. We start the simulation for the disambiguation of \"kick (the) bucket\" by setting the output value of the external unit \"kick\" representing the output of a sub wordform level to 1. After three update cycles, the output of the external unit II (representing the fact that bucket is recognized) is set to 1. The duration of an external input is always one cycle. The availability of syntactic information is simulated by activating IIIb and IIIc before cycle seven. Figure (4) shows that the unit representing kick as a verb immediately follows this syntactic information and \"kick as a noun\" falls beneath activation treshold. After some more cycles a stable situation is reached (Figure (5)) which represents the best fitting hypothesis: the idiomatic reading. 250 6"]}]}
