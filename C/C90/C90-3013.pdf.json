The first is a safe but fast method for discarding irrelevant disjunctions from newly-created structures. The second reduces the time required to check the consistency of a structure from exponential to polynomial in the number of disjunctions, except in cases that, it will be argued, should be very unusual in practical systems. The techniques are implemented in an experimental Japanese analyser that uses a large, existing disjunctive Japanese grammar and lexicon. Observations of the time behaviour of this analyser suggest that a significant speed gain is achieved."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper describes the approach taken to the unification of disjunctive feature structures in an experimental bottom-up shift-reduce Japanese aaalyser called Propane, for Prolog Parser using the Nadine Grammar. Nadine (Kogure, 1989; Kogure and Nagata, 1990), which is inlplemented in Lisp, is the analysis and translation component of SLoTRANS, the spoken language translation system under development at ATIt Interpreting Telephony Research Laboratories, and its large (12,000 line) grammar and lexicon make extensive use of disjunction.","The general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of disjunctions (Kasper, 1987). That is, barring revolutionary developments in the theory of algorithms, the problem is NP-complete, and the time taken to pertbrm such a unification can, in general, at best be an exponentially increasing function of the number of disjunctions, tlowever, in writing large grammars of natural languages, it is often convenient to be able to specify constraints in terms of disjunctions. This seems especially to be the case for Japanese, because of its relatively free word order and widespread ellipsis. It is therefore important to develop unification algorithms that can in practice unify disjunctive feature structures in a reasonable time, despite the inherent NP-completeness of the task. 70","Propane's unification method embodies two novel techniques. Firstly, when a new mother constituent is created by the application of a grammar rule to daughter constituents during bottom-up parsing, disjunctions not relevant to the mother can safely be removed, tIowever, deciding on relevance in less titan exponential time is a non-trivial problem. Propane's techniqne is rapid, and resuh.s in the removal of enough irrelevant disjunctions that constituents higher in a parse tree are not burdened with inordinately many of them. Secondly, Propane adopts a modification to Kasper's (I987) disjunctive unification algorithm that \"ahnost all the time\" (in a sense of that phrase to be discussed), runs in binomial time.","Practical results, which will be presented through-out this paper, suggest that these techniques have the desired effect of allowing Propane to parse even quite long sentences in a reasonable time. These results need, however, to be evaluated in the context of ATR's Japanese language processing research programme in general and of Propane's approach to parsing in particular, which will therefore be presented in the next section as a preliminary to the main body of the paper. 2 Bottom-up Parsing of Japanese 'Pile Nadine system is geared towards the processing of Japanese sentences of the type encountered in telephone conversations. At ATR, a substantial corpus of dialogues has been collected by simulating, both by speech and by keyboard, telephone calls to the organizing otfice of an international conference. At tile time the research described here was carried out, Nadine's grammar and lexicon were being developed and tested mainly on a subcorpus of 100 sentences comprising five of these dialogues. The results presented in this paper therefore all derive fl'om apply-ing Propane to this same sentence set. Although the size of the set is comparatively small, the sentences in it were not in any sense \"made up\" to suit either the Nadine or Propane parsers. Rather, to the degree that a simulation can approach reality, they can be taken as representatives of the kinds of sentences to be handled in a realistic language processing application.","Japanese has severM characteristics which suggest that bottom-up parsing~approaehes might be particular~ly fl'uitflfl..

When shifting, edges of all lengths are placed onto the stack, and are allowed to participate in any following sequence of reductions. Before the next shift, however, Propane \"prunes\" the edges that constitute the top of the stack, removing all but the longest. This corresponds to the assump~ lion that there is a preference for longer strings of characters to correspond to lexical items where possible, but that this preference should be overturned when a shorter string, but not a longer one, allows a reduction with what precedes it.","A laa'ge proportion of the lO0-sentence subcorpus targeted by Nadine can be parsed correctly by this simple approach of always preferring reductions to shifts and longer edges to shorter ones. Nevertheless, on .many occasions the correct parse will involve at least one violation of these pre['erenees. In general, some kind of intelligent backtracking and/or lookahead is required. In Propane, only a limited form of ]ookahead exists. Sometimes, an examination of the parts of speech (i.e. category names only and not feature values) in the grammar and those of the constituents in the stack and of t.he item that would be consumed in a shift shows the following situation: a reduction is possible, but if it is performed, the next shift cannot itself be followed by a reduction, whereas if a shift is performed next, two reductions may be possible. That is,, there are two alternatives: reduce now and then be forced to shift twice, or shift now and, unless unification failure prevents it, reduce twice. In such situations, Propane chooses the second option. This often allows sentences to be parsed which would not otherwise be, and does not prevent the parsing of any sentences in the subcorpus. Because only category names, and not features, are examined, the lookahead procedure is very quick.","With this small amount of lookahead included, Propane was able to parse 75 of the 100 sentences in the subcorpus. No attempt was made to check thoroughly the validity of these because of the present author's limited farniliarity with Japanese and the Nadine grarnmar; however, they were inspected in-formally, and none seemed to be obviously wrong. Of the 25 sentences for which no parse was found, ten involved an incorrect reduction. Eight of these might: have been prevented had information corresponding to Gunji's (1988) treatment of \"sentence levels\" for modification been present in the grammar. Twelve sentences failed through incorrectly favouring longer edges over shorter; all of these failures involved a lexical entry for the same particle sequence, and could have been prevented either by altering the treatment of that sequence or by im-: plementing the same kind of lirnited lookahead for: the long-over-short preferel~ee as was clone for the = reduce-over-shift preference. Of the other three failures, two were sentences on which the Nadine parser also failed, suggesting that they were outside grammatical and/or lexical coverage, and one remained unexplained.

Nevertheless, since n can sometimes be quite large, this exhaustive process be time~consunfiug, and indeed in the limit will take exponential time.","Propane's attempted solution to this problem is based on the hypothesis that the vast majority of large unrealiza.t~le di@mctive feature struct.ures that i:~mnber of disjunctions is independcnl o[\" subCree size.","2 Smnewha.t confusingly, l(aspee uses the term \"n-wise consb~tency\" for I.he ched¢ing of 'n q-- l-luples of (tis.itmcts. \\Ve avoid |,his usage. will be created in the use ofa practical natllt:al language grannnar will be not o~tly unrca.lizable, ])ut also \"pairwise ~mrealizable\", in the sense that they will Nil at or betb,'e the second stage of l(asper's consistency check, for k = 2.","The reasotl we can expect most unrealizable structures also to be pairwise unrealizable is that most comn rely, unrealizability will result from the contents of two nodes in the tree being incompatible, through assigning non-unifiable vah~es to the same positiol~ in a feature structure. Although there can clearly be exceptions, the hypothesis is that it is fairly unlikely, in a large disjunctive structure (which is the case where exponen|.iality would be harmful) that there would be a non-pairwise inconsistency but no pairwise inconsistency.","Following this hypothesis, when the Propane unitier has created a structure, it checks a~d prunes it first for pairwise consistency, and if this succeeds, risks trying for a single full realization (one choice at each disjunct) straight away. Thus it differs from Kasper's algorithm in two ways: no exhaustive leo wise checks are made for k > 2. and when a flfll check is made, only one success is required, avoid-ing an exhaustive search through all combinations of disjuncts, a Of course, if the structure is pairwise realizable but not flflly realizable, the search for a single success will take exponential time; but., accordlug to the hypothesis, such occurrences, for structure.s with enough disjuncts for exponential time co be unacceptably long, should be extremely rare.","The effectiveness of this strategy can only be judged by' observing its behaviour in practice. In fact, 7~o instances were observed of the search for a flfll realizabition taking an inordinately long time ar-Iel' pairwise consistency checking and pruning have succeeded. Thus it can be tentatively concluded that, wilh the current version of the Nadine grammar and with bottom-up parsing, the risk is worth taking: that is, a full realization is virtually always possible, in reasonable ~irne, tbr a pairwise consistent structure.

That is. even if simple ineGnsistencies art less predominant, they are still common enough that a large structure that is unrealizable because of complex inconsistencies will also","3According to M[axwell and Kaplan (1989), \"in practice, Kasper noted that...once bad singleton disjuncts have been eliminated, il is more efficient to switch to DNF [disjunctive normal form] (hart to compnie at[ of tim higher degrees of consistency.\" This variation of the algorithm given in Kasper (1987) is closer t.o Propane's strategy, b~H. the expansion io full [)N[,\" is it.self in general an exponeatia] pt'ocess and will. when many disjunctions remain, l.,e far more expensive Ihan looking for a single realizatiola."]},{"title":"4","paragraphs":["73 be unrealizable because of simple ones.","Of course, this does not alter the fact that in general, i.e. for an arbitrary input and for an arbitrary grammar written in the Nadine formalism, Propane's unification algorithm, like Kasper's, is exponential in behaviour. In the limit, an exponential term in the formula for the time behaviour of an algorithm will dominate, however small its associated constant factor.","Unlike Nadine's unifier, Propane's strategy has the property that when a structure survives consistency checking, not every member of every disjunct in it can necessarily participate in a full realization; that is, ideally, it should have been pruned. However, this property is only undesirable to the extent that, at the end of the parse, ii. makes any exhaustive search for flfll realizations inefficient through excessive backtracking. Again, in practice, this seems not to be a problem; exhaustive full realizat~ion is extremely quick compared to parsing.","An analysis of Propane's processing of its corpus reveals quite wide variation in the relationship between the total number of disjunctions in a rule application (in both daughters and the rule) and the time taken to perform the unification. However, although, unsurprisingly, unification time increases with the number of (|isjunctions, it. appears from inspection to be perhaps linear with a small binomiM component, and not exponential. This is, in fact, what an analysis of the algorithm predicts. The linear component derives from the check of each disjunct sepa.rately against the definite part., while the parabolic component derives from the pairwise check. The relatively small size of the latter may imply t.hat a majority of disjuncts are eliminated during the first phase, so the second has less work to do. 5 Unification and Parsing Times The al.~sence of any known exponential process (other than the final phase of unification, which appears never to take very long) in Propane's parsing and unification algorithms gives grounds for expect-ing that in practice, the time taken to parse a. senteuce of 7~ lexical items should be polynomial in n. Because of the pruning of irrelevant disjuhctions, the value of n should be fairly small, leading to a significant speed advantage over systems like the Nadine parser that do not, prune disjunctions and that use the full (exponential) version of Kasper's algorithm. The results of a comparison between Nadine's and Propane's parsing times suggest that such an advantage does exist. However, the results are not sufl'i-ciently detailed to allow the verification of Propane's exact time behaviour.","As senCence lengt.h grows, Propane. tends to perform progressively faster in a stntistically significant way. 4 In particular, Nadiue's attempts to parse two 'tI\"or each of (:lie 31 sell.i, ences containing more than one fairly long sentences (12 and 18 lexical items respectively) in the corpus had to be aborted because of the time they took, but both these sentences received a parse from Propane in ten to (;hirteeu minutes. Had Nadine not been aborted in these cases, two more data points would be available that would increase the significance further.","The progressive speed advantage of Propane may be dug partly to the fact that, a.s discussed above, it; follows only the single sequence of shifts and reductions specified by the algorithm described in section 2, and does not explore alternative bracketings. IIowever, Nadine is also, through numerical scot ing, sensitive to the left branching preference, which guides it to explore, and presumably to find, preferred parses first; and the Nadine times used in 1he comparison were those taken to find the first parse, not all parses.","Another difference between the two parsers is thai Nadine, being chart-based, stores the edges it creates so that later backtracking need not cause work to be rel)eated. Propane does not backtrack in this way. However, because o[\" a mundane practical limitation in the Prolog implementation used, Propane is also forced to store (assert in the database) every constituent it. creates, advancing the. parse by successive storing, lhiling and backtracking rather than by the simple recursion that would otherwise be performed. The time taken to store constituents in fact increases faster than that used by or.her aspects of processing, and :['or the longest sentences parsed represents 70 to 80 per cent of the total time. It might be, therefor< tha.t if storage time were ignored for both parsv,>, Propane's speed advantage would be eveI1 more apparent.","Such vague remarks are admittedly unsatis~qng and should, given time, be firmed up by the acquisition and analysis of more data., and by separate evaluations of the parsing and unification time be-haviours. The latter would im~olve comparing the two pa.rsers framing with the same unifier and then the two unifiers rmming under the same parsing algorithm. Nevertheless, there are, as already mentioned, a priori grounds for ex-pect.ing Propane's unitier to have an increasingly marked advantage, and the data presented here are fully consistent with that expectation, showing as they do a statistically significant trend.","A formal complexity analysis of a botton>up parser using the techniques described in this paper would only be of limited interest. Complexity analyses deal with worst cases, and in those terms, the essential hypothesis th at p airwise consistency checking will ':ahnost all the time\" be suNcient is meaningless. Likewise, to claim that disjmlction pruning lexicM item and succes~f,dly parsed t35' both systems, the correlation was mea.sured bt~tween the nmnber of lexieM items in the seatence and tile ]ogarithm of the ratio of parsing times. It was easily statistically siglfificant at the 5% level, and its sign indicated that the correlation is in the direction of Propane performing bett.er for longer sentences. 5 74 greatly reduces the number of disjunctions it, higher tree nodes in the case of Propane and the Nadine grammar, is to say nothing about its effectiveness in the worst ease. One could easily write a grammar in which every disjunction fi'om daughter nodes was needed by mothers, so that nothing would be pruned at all. And thirdly, it is not claimed that the left-branching preference in aNpanese is anything more than a preference, albeit quite a strong one.","However, because the grammar, lexicon and sentence set dealt with here are in no sense toy ones written to test unification techniques but are the tools of a major effort to process natural language us it ~ actually used, it is of interest to analyse Propane's overall time behaviour under the assumption that the relationships inferred a.bove through observation and statistical rnethods are valid) There seems to be no a priori reason to doubt that the same behaviour could be achieved by' other system,~ or. for other languages (except, of course, that the left-branching characteristic is language-dependent).","Thus in Propane, the number of unifications attempted (luring the successful parsing of a sentence of length N is O(N) (this happy situation is, of course, bought at the price of failure when the preference heuristics fail). Let us a.ssnme a strongly left-branching structure, which, being maximally unbalanced, is the worst case. Then the number k of nodes dominated by each new mother node the parser (attempts to) create will be uniformly distributed between 0 and N. From observation, it seems that the number of disjunctions d involved in a unification that. dominates k nodes will be proportional to k (This is the pessimistic option; as argued earlier, there are grounds for hoping that, with suNeient pruning, d will not increase with k at all, so that disjunctive unification time will made no contribu-tion to parsing time as a flmction of N). Unification time for d disjunctions, under the pairwise consistency hypothesis, appears to be proportional to d 2. Compositional semantic interpretation will probably mean in the limit that the size of the non-disjunctive part of a constituent will also be proportional to the number of constituents dominated. Unification time here is order n lo,q n in the sizes n of the input structures (Kasper, 1987). Thus a node dominating k others will take order kalog k time to create. Summing over k fi'om 0 to N gives an order N41o.qN result. More generally, a parsing algorithm that on atomic categories h~s order f(N) should, with disjunction, have order f(N)N21ogN if the distribution of k over nodes created is also uniform.","In conclusion, the assessnrents of the various aspects of Propane's time behaviour are all consistent with, and in some eases provide good evidence for,","5StatisticM correlation tests, of course, cannot tell us what relationship, e.g. linear or exponential, holds between two variables; they can only tell us that sore e relationship appears to exist. ~J'he time anMysis can therefore only be tentative. the claim that the two novel techniques described here can signifieantly enhance the speed with which sentences can be parsed using a large grammar containing disjunctions. As long us the essential hypothesis about pairwise consistency holds [br the particular grammar and the sentences it will in practice encounter, polynomial time behaviour can bc expected, as compared to an exponential time for other approaches involving disjunctive unification.
