They arc also used as terms for indexation. From the statistical point of view, too, nouns are by far the most numerous category.","That is the reason why the basis for this parser is that the sentence is considered as a stack of NPs, with relations of determination between them. An initial NP is laid (it is often the focus of the sentence), and the following phrases precise and determine it. Here determination is considered as adding more data. These different NPs are connected in a more or less narrow way by \"links\":","• \"non verbal links\": prepositions, co-ordinations, subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns,","• verbs in all their forms: conjugated, present and past participles, infinitives.","Thus the processing of the verb is unified in such a manner that every verb, conjugated or not, of a main or subordinated clause, acts as an adjective (is a \"mmslatd\" to adjective, according to Tesnigre's concept, in [Tesni&e 591), determines a NP and is a link in tile \"chain\" of NPs.","Thereforc, the NP is considered as the basic and constitutive element of the sentence (as the cell is the basic and constitutive element of the living tissue). The inside and the outside of the NP are processed separately and differently, so we have:","• a grammar of the NP, centered on a nominalized word (like the inside structure of the cell, centered on its nucleus),","• and a grammar of the sentence, outside the NP, which is expressed in terms of NPs, each of them considered as a closed entity (like the structure of the tissue expressed as an architecture of cells).
