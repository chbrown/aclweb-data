The fundamental cause of the modifications is the need to effectively accornmodate the relatively fi'ee orderings in clause constittmnts of many languages. Thus, fbr example, in augmented phrase structure grammars (APSGs), which include definite clause grammars, it is inconvenient |o specify each legal dependent ordering by a separale phrase structure rule. Instead, as discussed by Jensen (1987), it is more convenient to l;,)cus on binary rules, combining a node containing a head with one of its modifiers, e.g., VPO -> VP] hiP; VPO -> VPl PP; etc, tJsing lhese binary forms, tile phrase structure portion of the rules indicate not much more than the side of a head on wMch a modifier may occur.

Also, explicit facilities are needed fbr sh'ucture building to avoid separale nodes tot each rule applied. 1 lrinally, if tlle rules are used in combination with a lexicat orienlation, since modifiers are indicated in phrase structure rules by general category (e.g., NP), augmenlations must locale and speci[}7 tire relationship hetween the modifier category and the specific modifier expressed type (e.g., an expected complement).

These operations have considerable inherent redundancy even though much flmction is abstracted out within \"choosemodifier\". The \"choosemodifier\" operation occurs in all complement attachment rules. Feature projection and structure building occur in all rules. lqnally, the actual precedence rt, le aspects can be expressed more perspicuously than via feature state testing. Looking ahead slightly, one way of\" summarizing the situation is to say that when a grammar paradigm which originally combines qD\" and \"LW resorts to binary rules, especially in the presence of a lexical focus, the grammar becomes, to a hu'ge extent, a head-driven grammar, without the ability to lake filll advantage of the facloriug opportunities atlbrded."]},{"title":"3.2 Extensions for Bi-.Directionality","paragraphs":["So far we have covered somewhat old ground. Why are these modified approaches especially problematic in a bi-dircctional context? Because there one is laced with an unpleasant choice between probably untenable complexity and unnecessary generation. To justil) lhis claim, we return to the rule illustrated in section 3.1, first examining ils assumed operation in a generative direction. In generation the interpreter instantiates almost empty constituents VPI and NP. \"Choosemodifier\" then aU.empts to find an expected modifier frame for the head of VP0 with the given label whose semanlJc subfi'ame (containing a valency number) unifies with one of the actual modifiers (VP0.modifiers) of VP0, and whose syntactic subfi'ame unifies with NP, returns the result as M, and the remainder of the modifiers as M1, etc.","1 Similar tendencies are observed in contemporary categorial grammars. For example, Yoo and Lee (1988) use \"quotient\" categories which speciI) unordered sets of possible arguments, togelher with separate 1.t 7 rules. Bes and Gardent (1989) also use sels within categories, together with order features to constrain adjacency. 2 295 But such rules do not really satisfy tire requirements o[\" generation. They describe syntactically correct structures but specify no ordering constraints and preferences relating to either semantic considerations (e.g., required orderings of adjective types in English, and conventional orderings of verb modifiers) or to textual considerations such as topic and locus. In parsing such provisions are needed to detect textual features, and in generation they m'e needed to use textual features to determine ordering. if these provisions were added, the \"feature testing\" aspects relating to ordering would become considerably more complicated, if expressible at all. This is because detecting and using textual considerations seems to involve taking irrto account the entire complex of\" moditiers tbr a head, which is extremely awkward in terms of binary phrase structure rules. llajicova (1989) describes topic/focus determination conditions for both English and Czech; they involve both semantic role information and complex sibling relationships. If those conditions were expressed in tile context of binary rules, it seems that a rule such as VP[~ -> VPl x in the parse would have the responsibility of assigning x to \"lbcus\" if there has been a break to the left of x in the conwmtional ordering of dependent roles (for Czech), and irrdeterminate otherwise (until ffu'ther dependents are found). In generation the rule might be licensed at a stage in generation where x is either (a) part of the topic, and VP0 contains only topic dependents, or (b) part of the tbcus and ranks highest of the dependents in VP0 in the systemic order'. (Topic/focus identification criteria for [:.nglish are also considered by I lajicova, and are more complicated). So adding textual provisions to phrase structure rules would pose a considerable challenge. Simply put, attaching dependents to heads one at a time is a convenient approach in parsing, but detaching them one at a time is not a convenient approach for generation. On the other hand, if textual provisions are omitted from the grammar, then generation would produce all syntactically legitimate sentences. One would then use additional rule sets to select among all the generated utterances based on semantic and textually based prefercnces2 (And rules are also need to detect textual features during analysis.)"]},{"title":"4. Head Driven Grammars and Slot Grammar","paragraphs":["l lead driven grammars which combine a lexical focus with a strict ID/LP partitioning avoid the problems described above. We use Slot Grammar as an example. Ttle lexicon formulation of Slot Grammar is interesting in that it identifies dependents, both complements and adjuncts, by \"slotnames\", a device originating in earlier work by McCord (1980). The (alternative) sh'uctures which can be used to realize those slots are Ihctored out into separate \"filler rules\". These rules contain conditions on both prospective fillers and associated heads. They can thus be used to constrain/adjust features of the constituents under consideration, e.g., to instantiate agreernent. In other words, Ihey can be used to express many 11) constraints. The basic linear precedence conditions of Slot Grammar are expressed by two types of rules. \"Head/Slot\" rules indicate tile sides of the head on which a particular \"slot\" may appear. These rules are conditional in terms of unifiers for both head and slot filler. \"Slot/slot\" rules indicate, again conditionally, precedence rules among slots on the same side of a head. Organizing infbrmation in tiffs way allows the elimination of the explicit: specification of many aspects of the rule shown in section 3.1 :","1. Association of \"categories\" with complements and adjuncts is eliminaled - ordering is stated in terms of slots rather than the more general syntactic categories.","2. \"ChoosemodiIier\" becomes lhe basic, built-in control operation of the parser, and need not be expressed explicitly","3. Struchn-e building operations are, to a large extent, implicit. Only variations in feature projection, etc treed be expressed explicitly. The remainder of tire information in the rule is expressed by two short rules, one whlch indicates that indirect objects thll on the right sides of beads, and the other that they precede dh'ect objeds. The revised organization o1' information also provides the basis fbr dealing with semantic and textually corrditioned ordering requirements without either undue complexity or exhaustive generation. This is because the inherent modularity allows the use of different control schemes for parsing and generation. In parsing the control scheme can be ~attach one dependent at a time\", using immediate dominance rules and basic linear precedence constraints together. In generation the control scheme can be altered to first generate sets of dependent& using just immediate dominance rules, and then","2 There have been efforts to combine textual considerations with non-il)/l,P grammars. For example, Uszkoreit (1998) uses exhaustive enumeration of alternative modifier orderings, irmluding complements and adjuncts, with selection among alternatives made by a focus feature. However, in parsing, the suggestion must somehow \"collapse\" to a set-oriented approach, using the enumerated alternatives as a kind of LP rule. Also, as implied by the results of ltajicova (1989), and explicitly argued by Hauenschild (1988), these provisions are not sufiqdent."]},{"title":"296 3","paragraphs":["ordering them using both basic precedence constraints and preference-oriented ones."]},{"title":"5. Current Direction","paragraphs":["Recapitulaling, bi-direetional grammar effbrts combining lexicalism with an ID/LP separation seem most promising because","1. A lexical lbcus in itself provides a great deal of bi-directional facility.","2. In current grammars based on non-ll)/LP paradigms, linear precedence constraints governing syntactic correctness are expressed by constraints on features of one node of a binary rule. F, xtending this approach to deal with preferential ordering is at best extremely complex, and possibly infeasible, but the alternative seems to be exhaustive generation followed by filtering.","3. In contrast, the modularity provided by an ID/LP separation allows rules to be applied in different combinations in parsing and generation. In the work underlying tiffs paper, a multi-lingual machine translation project, a bi-directional grmnmar formalism is being developed inspired by Slot Grammar, but with modifications including:","1. adding a fully reversible morphological component in the lexicon","2. expanding the lexical provisions to include explicit bi-direelJonal mappings between syntactic and more abstract representations 3. revising the notation to facilitate reversibility.","4. using a slotname type-lattice to simplil) the expression of generalizations.","5. adding preferential precedence rules dealing with semanlic and textual considerations. The preferential ordering rules are used in the analysis phase to detect textual features, and are applied after a postparse disambiguation analysis (based on a heuristic search algorithm described in (Newman 1988)). In generation, however, the pretbrential ordering rules are applied together with those expressing absolute ordering constraints. A preliminary descriplion of these provisions has been documented (Newman, to appear). The preferential precedence rules are of two kinds: one kind relates to the association ot\" dependenls with \"zones\" of a constituent (e.g., pre-subject, pre-finite,...), and the other kind deals with their ordering within zones. Zones are used because some aspects of dependent ordering are most conveniently described in those terms, as discussed by Quirk et al (1972), Uszkorelt (1988) and others. 3 Zone association rules express the preferences of certain types of modifiers for certain zones, and also variations in these preferences due to textual considerations. These preferences must bE balanced, by heuristics, against the needs of other modifiers and the constraints imposed by the zones themselves. Optimal ways of stating and using these preferences represents a major lbcus of our current work. , 1."]},{"title":"References.","paragraphs":["lies, G.G., (?ardent, C. \"French Order Without Order\", Proc. 4th Conf. of European Chapter of\" ACL (1989), 249-255","2.
