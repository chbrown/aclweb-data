Epistemic modality is used as a linguistic feature for multiple NLP tasks and applications, including sentiment analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab 2011), opinion mining (Benamara et al. 2012) and scientific discourse evaluation (Waard and Maat 2012), among others.","To-date, there are no large-scale modality-annotated Arabic corpora compared to English (Baker et al. 2010, 2012; Rubinstein et al. 2013), Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013), Portuguese (Hendrickx et al. 2012) and Japanese (Matsuyoshi et al. 2010). The creation of modality-annotated corpora is non-trivial because there is no consensus definition of modality and its attributes in theoretical linguistics to be rendered into annotation tasks and guidelines. Furthermore, most current modality annotation schemes rely on sophisticated theoretically-grounded guidelines that require annotators from linguistics background; hence, annotation is usually restricted to small-scale in-lab settings.","In this paper, we present 3arif, a large-scale Arabic corpus annotated for epistemic modality. 3arif comprises 9822 unique tweets in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Arabic (EA), annotated for 9966 tokens that map to 214 unique types of epistemic modality. Each epistemic modality is annotated for sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holder(s) and scope(s). The reason that 3arif features the tweets' genre with an emphasis on MSA and EA tweets is that it comes as part of a larger project to incorporate linguistic features, such as modality, with network-based features to automatically identify the key players of Twitter's political discourse in counties of political unrest such as Egypt. We harvested 3arif from a variety of Twitter users including newspapers, TV stations, political campaigns, among others, as well as individuals. As a result 3arif is diglossic for MSA, the formal Arabic variety, and EA, the native Arabic dialect of Egypt.","For the annotation of 3arif, we design a simplified procedure that depicts the following ideas: first, it defines each annotation task as a series of open and closed questions that do not require sophisticated linguistics background and, meanwhile, provide annotators with self-explanatory annotation guidelines; second, it is interactive so that questions are displayed/hidden based on annotators' prior answers; and finally, it semi-automatically identifies and merges nested epistemic modality based on annotators' answers to a number of easy-to-administer questions.

Results show high inter-annotator reliability and agreement rates and indicate that our annotation scheme and procedure are efficient. The contribution of this research, therefore, is twofold: first, we create a novel resource for Arabic NLP which is expected to enhance research on modality automatic identification and extraction; second, we present an efficient and easy-to-administer annotation procedure with interactive crowdsourcing potentials for the complex task of modality annotation.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our annotation scheme including annotation tasks, guidelines and the interactive structure; Section 3 gives examples for the representation of the final annotation outputs; Section 4 describes corpus harvesting and sampling; Section 5 discusses the results and presents a disagreement analysis; Section 6 compares and contrasts our work to related work; and Section 7 highlights the points not covered in this current version of 3arif."]},{"title":"2 Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["Our annotation scheme consists of six tasks to label sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders and scopes for each epistemic modality. Prior to the beginning of the interactive annotation procedure, we highlighted all candidate epistemic modalities in each tweet using a string-match algorithm and the lexicons from Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013, 2014). The algorithm finds all potential epistemic modality triggers (i.e. words and phrases that may convey epistemic modality) within each tweet in our corpus and marks them as annotation units. A total of 9966 candidate epistemic modality triggers are highlighted in 9822 tweets. 2.1 Task 1: Sense Sense annotation is to decide for each highlighted candidate trigger in context whether it actually conveys epistemic modality. The same lexical verb ا A$Er is used as an epistemic modality trigger an-ticipating a future possibility in example 1; but as a non-modal lexical verb in example 2.","1. ا نا]لا ر 30 ن ھ[3  A$Er An[nA snksr rqm Al30 mlywn mtZAhr] I feel that [we will get 30+ million protesters].","2. #ھ :ا أ ب ىذ أ او #hykl: A$Er bAlfxr wAlqlq >yDA fy *krY Hrb >ktwbr #Heikl: I feel proud but also worried when I remember October's war.","We define sense annotation as a synonymy judgment task, following Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013). Epistemic modality is represented by an exemplar set manually selected so that: (1) each exemplar is an unambiguous epistemic trigger, (2) exemplars are in both MSA and EA, (3) exemplars comprise both simple words and multiword expressions, (4) exemplars are both affirmative and negative, and (5) exemplars are of different lexical intensities. Furthermore, we create multiple versions of the same set so that we cover the inflections for gender, number, person, tense, mood, and aspect in Arabic. We then use the set that morphologically matches the candidate trigger to be annotated. Presented with a pre-highlighted candidate trigger in context and the exemplar set, annotators are to decide whether the given candidate trigger is synonymous to the exemplar set, and is hence an epistemic modality trigger, or not.","If an annotator decides that a given candidate trigger does not convey epistemic modality, no further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes are displayed. To guarantee that annotators do not select the non-synonymous option as an easy escape, they are not allowed to move forward without submitting at least one synonym of their own to the candidate trigger.","Designing the interactive procedure as such results in disagreement propagation. If one annotator decides that a given candidate trigger is not epistemic, but another annotator decides that it is, the former will not have to answer any further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes; whereas the latter will have to provide answers for each of those annotation tasks. 3 Throughout the examples, epistemic modality triggers are represented in boldface and scopes are in-between square brackets."]},{"title":"1522","paragraphs":["2.2 Task 2: Polarity Task 2 uses as input the candidates labeled as valid epistemic modality triggers in Task 1 and labels each as either affirmative or negative. An affirmative trigger indicates that the speaker holds the given state of affairs (i.e. propositions) as TRUE; whereas a negative trigger indicates that the given propositions are held as FALSE by the speaker.","To decide on whether the polarity is affirmative or negative, annotators are instructed to look for the absence/presence of such negation markers as: • Negation particles such as m$ (not), lA (not) and gyr (not), among others. • Negation affixes like the circumfix m...$ in mZn$ (I do not think). • Negative polarity items like ي Emry (never) and lm yEd (no longer).","• Negative auxiliaries where negation is placed on the past tense auxiliary as in او mknt$ wAvq (I was not sure).","• Inherently-negative triggers that encode negation in their lexical meanings such as mstHyl (impossible).","Annotators are instructed that using multiple negation markers results in an affirmative sense. Thus, ا lys mn AlmstHyl (it is not impossible) means that the proposition is actually possible according to the speaker. Put differently, it means that the speaker holds the proposition as TRUE. Annotators are required to give the reason for negation if they decide that a given trigger is negative. 2.3 Task 3: Intensification Epistemic modality triggers can have different lexical intensities (i.e. intensities encoded in the lexical meaning of the word/phrase regardless of the context). For instance, even without a context, Arabic speakers know that mt>kd (I am/he is sure) expresses higher possibility than mthy>ly (I imagine). When used in context, the trigger's lexical intensity can be maintained as is. Yet, it can also be amplified or mitigated by various linguistic means such as:","• Modification: adverbs like tmAmA (absolutely) and bAlfEl (indeed), among others, amplify lexical intensity; whereas mitigation can be caused by such adverbs as tqrybA (almost) and gAlbA (most probably), among others.","• Categorical negation typically amplifies lexical intensity as in اأ m$ mmkn >bdA (it is not possible at all).","• Emphatic expressions such as qd (indeed) and اللهو wAllh (I swear), among others, lead to lexical intensity amplification.","• Coordination of two or more triggers usually results in intensity amplification as in و فر EArf wmt>kd (I know and I am sure).","The annotators' task for intensification is to decide for each candidate labeled as a valid epistemic modality trigger in Task 1 whether its lexical intensity is amplified (AMP), mitigated (MTG), or maintained (AS IS). During interactive annotation, annotators are asked to provide the reason for their selec-tion; that is, whether the lexical intensity is affected by an adverb, categorical negation, an emphatic expression, coordination, or any other reason. 2.4 Task 4: Tense In this version of 3arif, we work on the present and past tenses only. Thus, Task 4 is to decide for each valid epistemic trigger from Task 1 whether it is present (PRS) or past (PST). Tense can be marked either morphologically by inflections and affixes or contextually by auxiliary verbs such as ن kAn (was), among others. Annotators are also required to give their reasons for selecting either PRS or PST. 2.5 Task 5: Holder Holder annotation is to identify the holder of the epistemic modality which is the ±RATIONAL entity that expresses its knowledge, beliefs or judgments about the world's states of affairs."]},{"title":"1523","paragraphs":["Holders can be −RATIONAL entities as in example 3. The entity that is making the assumption that the former Palestinian president - Yasser Arafat - may have died of natural causes is the report issued by the French government.","3. :]ةو #ت ر ط ب د[ tqryr frnsy: [wfAp #ErfAt rbmA tEwd lAsbAb TbyEyp] A French report: [natural causes might be behind the death of #Arafat].","The holder is not necessarily the same as the trigger's grammatical subject. In example 4, the grammatical subject of و ybdw (seems) is ايرا ن AlAElAn Aldstwry (the constitutional declaration). However, the entity that is making the judgment about this declaration is the French government, which is then the real holder of ybdw.","4. :]ا ا يرا نو ا ها ا[ frnsA: [AlAElAn Aldstwry Aljdyd lmrsy lA ybdw Anh yslk AlAtjAh AlSHyH] France: [Morsi's new constitutional declaration does not seem to be a correct move].","Twitter users do not only post their own knowledge, beliefs and judgments about the world's states of affairs, but also they (1) directly and indirectly quote others and (2) make assumptions about others' knowledge, beliefs and judgments. This means that we can have nested holders, according to Wiebe et al. (2005) and Saurí and Pustejovsky (2009), where we know about others' knowledge, beliefs and judgments only though the writer or the Twitter user in our case.","In example 5, the Twitter user quotes Elbaradei stating that he may run for presidency if the people want him to. That is, the holder of the epistemic modality is actually Elbaradei not the Twitter user.","5. داا : ]ا تا أ[ ا ط اذإ AlbrAdEy: qd [>tr$H fy AntxAbAt Alr}Asp] <*A Tlb Al$Eb Elbaradei: I may [run for presidency] if the people want me to.","The holder of the epistemic modality in example 6 is not the Twitter user, either. However, the Twitter user is not quoting anyone here, but is rather making an assumption about what the Egyptian National Party holds as TRUE.","6. طا با نا] ه[ #Jan25 AlHzb AlwTny mqtnE An[h mmkn yrjE] #Jan25 The National Party is convinced that [it may get back to authority]. #Jan25","We can have two or more nested holders.

Similarly, in example 6, we have two nested holders: the first is the Egyptian National Party and the second is the Twitter user who makes the assumptions about the party's beliefs.","In example 7, however, we have three nested holders. The first is ناا AlAxwAn (the Muslim Brotherhood) that holds as TRUE the proposition that the Military Council is conspiring against them. That belief of the Muslim Brotherhood is communicated to us through the politician حا ا Abw AlftwH (Abulfotoh) who is then the second holder. Yet, Abulfotoh has not posted his assumption about the Muslim Brotherhood's belief on his personal account. Instead, he has been quoted by another Twitter user, who is the third holder.","7. حا ا : ناااور نا]يا ةا كھ[ Abw AlftwH: AlAxwAn tSwrwA An [hnAk m&Amrp mn AlEskry] Abulfotoh: The Muslim Brotherhood members thought that [there was a conspiracy by the Military Council].","During the interactive procedure, annotators are first asked whether the holder is the same as the Twitter user. If not, more questions are displayed to determine: (1) who the real holder is; (2) whether the tweet is a(n) (in)direct quote (e.g. there are direct quotation markers or such words as ل qAl (he said) and ح SrH (he declared), among others), or the tweet conveys the Twitter user's assumptions about others."]},{"title":"1524","paragraphs":["When the holder is not the same as the Twitter user, annotators are asked to mark the boundaries of","the linguistic unit that corresponds to the holder in the tweet's text, following the maximal length prin-","ciple from Szarvas et al. (2008), so that they mark the largest possible, meaningful linguistic unit.","Hence, in example 8 the holder is the Islamist opponents in #KSA not only the Islamist opponents.","8. ان ران #دا ن أن]ھ ةرا #[","Al<slAmywn AlmEArDwn fy #AlsEwdyp mwqnwn >n[hA tsEY lqtl Alvwrp fy #mSr]","Islamist opponents in #KSA know for sure that [it tries to put an end to #Egypt's revolution]. 2.6 Task 6: Scope Scopes are the states of affairs modified by the epistemic modality triggers. Modality scopes in Arabic are most likely realized as clauses, deverbal nouns or to-infinitives, according to Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013). We use the same maximal length guideline from Task 5 so that the scope segment marked by the annotators is the largest possible segment typically delimited by: (1) punctuation markers and (2) subordinate conjunctions such as ن lAn (because) and lw (if), among others.","In the case of nested triggers as in example 9, where a trigger and its scope are both embedded in another trigger's scope, the interactive procedure prompts the annotators to label each trigger and its scope separately at first. Afterwards, we automatically merge them as we further explain in Section 3.","9. با طا نأ]ه ][[ #Jan25 AlHzb AlwTny mqtnE >n[h mmkn [yrjE]] #Jan25 The National Party is convinced that [it may [get back to power]] #Jan25","Annotators are instructed that a single trigger may have one or more scopes. In example 10, the trigger bythy>lhm (they imagine) scopes over two complement clauses, which annotators are required to identify. Furthermore, annotators are given the guideline that two or more triggers - typically conjoined by a coordinating conjunction - can share the same scope as in example 11. In the cases like example 11, each trigger and its attributes are first annotated separately and then once our system finds out that they share the same polarity, intensification, tense, holder, and scope, they are merged together as we show in Section 3.","10. دوأ نا]رھ حار اا مد [ناو] ھأ ا ر ھ[ >wlAdnA bythy>lhm An [dm AxwAthm rAH hdr] wAn[hm Endhm v>r mE AlslTp bkl >$kAlhA] Our children imagine that [their friends were killed for no reason] and that [they now have to take revenge from the authorities].","11. ھ ة نو [ھ % 12 ] نا و فر داا AlbrAdEy EArf wmtAkd An [nsbp 12% bs htntxbh] wEl$An kdp m$ hyr$H nfsh Elbaradei knows and is sure that [only 12% will vote for him].

The representation of example 15 reads as follows: the USER (i.e. the Twitter user) used to moderately hold as TRUE the proposition that the revolutionist candidates were unable to compete for presidency. We know that this is a past belief that the USER used to have because annotators have labeled the trigger تر tSwrt (I thought) as past (PST). There are no nested holders given that the USER is the same as the holder. The intensity value of MODerate comes from the fact that تر tSwrt (I thought) is of a moderate lexical intensity being weaker than such epistemic triggers as mtAkd (I am sure) and فر EArf (I know) but stronger than such epistemic triggers as ظا AZn (I guess) and mthyAly (I imagine). Meanwhile, the lexical intensity of tSwrt is neither amplified nor mitigated; hence annotators have given it an AS IS intensification label in Task 3. Consequently, in the final annotation output the original lexical intensity value has been used to represent how far the holder used to consider his/her belief as TRUE.","15. اا تر ا ن] ةرا اا [ fy AlbdAyp tSwrt An [mr$Hy Alvwrp ADEf mn AlmnAfsp llr}Asp] At first, I thought that [the revolutionist candidates are too weak to compete for presidency]. rep.

Most of the exemplars from Section 2.1 are adjuncts and, thus, none can be both a lexical and a grammatical substitute for لا AHtmAl (a possibility) in such a context.","21. لا نا]رد ءا ا ر [ لا ھو AHtmAl An [r}ys mntxb yHl Almjls AvnA' SyAgp dstwr jdyd] AHtmAl whmy The possibility that [an elected president dissolves the parliament during the constitution's write-up] is an unrealistic possibility.","Stative triggers such as ف yErf (he knows) and كر ydrk (he realizes) invoke disagreement as to whether they indicate the acquisition of new information; that is, they literally mean perceive, or they mark confirmed beliefs as in be sure that. For example 22, the annotators have two interpretations: (1) a non-modal interpretation that whoever says so does not perceive that the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without the Brotherhood, and (2) a modal interpretation that whoever says so does not believe that the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without the Brotherhood.","22. ما اھ ل ياف نا]ا ا عا نود را ا ا[ Al*y yqwl h*A AlklAm lA yErf An [Almr$d lA ystTyE Ax* qrAr dwn AlrjwE AlY AljmAEp]. Whoever says so does not perceive/believe that [the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without the Brotherhood].","Opinionated-evidential triggers like yzEm (he claims) do not only mark reported speech, but also they communicate the reporter's own opinion about the truth value of the reported proposition. They entail that from the reporter's perspective the proposition is FALSE. Hence, annotators disagree as to whether yzEm and similar triggers should be labeled as epistemic or not. We have eventually excluded such triggers as epistemic and have included them as evidential triggers for another corpus that is left for a future publication.","Highly-polysemous triggers like ymkn (can/possible) lead to disagreement because in many cases even the context is ambiguous. In example 23, both interpretations of it is not possible that (epistemic) and it is not doable that (abilitive) seem to be acceptable.","23. ] ب\"قا \" اروا ا \" :ة ت \"و\"ا ن\"[ lA ymkn [fhm ktAb mHmd mrsy \"vA}r mn Al$rq\" AlA btAml AlktAbyn AlmjAwryn: \"srqAt Sgyrp\" w \"jnwn AlHkm\"] It is not possible/doable [to understand Morsi's book - A Revolutionist from the East - without reading the other two books of Small Robberies and Ruling Mania].","Intensity-related disagreement is attributed to (1) intensity on the holder that propagates to the trigger and (2) negation with moderate-intensity triggers. In example 24, the USER uses categorical negation on the holder ا نا ي lA ywjd Ay AnsAn EAql (there is no one sane person). For some annotators, the power of categorical negation spreads to the trigger, moving its intensity up the scale. As for negation with moderate-intensity triggers, some annotators think that lA ymkn (not possible) is synonymous to impossible. Hence, they consider the negation as an amplification marker.","24. نا يأ ن] بھرا[ lA ywjd >y AnsAn EAql yEtqd b>n [AlArhAb yEAlj bAlsyAsp] There is no one sane person who thinks that [terrorism can be defeated through politics]."]},{"title":"1529","paragraphs":["Polarity-related disagreement is mainly caused by negation due to (1) negated holders and (2) contextual negation. Negated holders as in example 24 perplex the annotators as to whether the negation scopes over the holder only or both the holder and the trigger. Thus, for some annotators, yEtqd (he thinks) is affirmative; and for others it is negative. By contextual negation we mean using words such as ا Alm$klp (the problem) to describe triggers as in example 25. The USER says that the problem is to think that it is a small-scale conflict. To describe this as a problem means that the USER thinks of the proposition as FALSE; that is, according to the USER it is actually a large-scale conflict.","25. إ ار نإ] ك ا ا ةاا ر عاا[ Alm$klp <nnA ntSwr <n [AlSrAE mHSwr fY AldA}rp AlDyqp AllY bntHrk fyhA] The problem is to think that [the conflict is only happening at this small-scale we are working on].","Holder-related disagreement is attributed mainly to generic nouns and impersonal pronouns such as ا Al$Eb (the people) and اا AlwAHd (one). Some annotators interpret them as implicitly referring to the USER. Therefore, they select the USER as the only holder with zero nesting in example 26. Other annotators interpret them as referring to people in general but not necessarily with the USER included; and thus, they select two-level nested holders.","26. اف نا] ا ھ طاا رامدا او ا ء [ Al$Eb yErf An [AlmmArsp AldymwqrATyp hy Alty st>ty bAEDA' mjls Al$Eb wAlr}ys AlqAdm] People know that [democracy will result in real parliamentary and presidential elections].","Scope-related disagreement is attributed to (1) ambiguous subordinate conjunctions, (2) triggers modifiers, (3) absent punctuation markers, and (4) embedding within the scope boundaries. For in-stance, in example 27, the adverbial clause starting with bEd (after) confuses the annotators as to whether it is part of the scope or it describes the verb epistemic trigger ا AtwqE (I expect).","27. ا نا ا] ا ما ا ن لا رظ ا ما ط [ AtwqE jdA An [AEtSAm AltHryr ytfD bnfs Tryqp fD AlAEtSAm AlAxyr bEd Zhwr A$kAl grybp fljAn AlAmn] I very much expect that [the sit-in in Tahrir will be broken up in the same way as the last sit-in after seeing some strange faces at the security checkpoints].","Tense yields almost perfect inter-annotator alpha reliability and agreement rates. The one main disagreement factor, however, is such contexts as قا ا Abtdyt ASdq (I started to believe). While the majority of annotators agree that such contexts mark present tense knowledge, beliefs and judgments, some annotators consider them as past tense. 5.4 Majority Statistics for 3arif Based on majority annotations, Table 3 gives statistics for 3arif in terms of sense, polarity, intensification and tense. Furthermore, approximately 62% of the triggers have zero-nested holders (i.e. the Twitter user is the same as the holder).

Inter-annotator agreement rate is 0.95 including the NONE category where no belief markers exist.","Baker et al. (2010, 2012) simultaneously annotate modality and modality-based negation to build modality taggers to enhance Urdu-English machine translation systems. Their annotation scheme distinguishes eight modality types: requirements, permissions, success, effort, intention, ability, desires and beliefs. Originally, their annotation scheme labels three attributes for each modality type: triggers, holders and targets (i.e. scopes). Yet, holders have not been eventually labeled. A unique feature of their annotation scheme is using a simplified operational procedure to label modality semantic meanings. The procedure relies on a list of thirteen choices of the form of H (modal) [P true/false] where H is a holder and P is a proposition or an event. The annotators' task is then to select the best form to represent the modality meaning of a given trigger. Reported kappa κ inter-annotator agreement rates are 0.82 for triggers and 0.76 for targets.","Rubinstein et al. (2013) propose a linguistically-motivated scheme for modality annotation in the MPQA English corpus. They attain macro alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.89 and 0.65 for sense and scope, respectively. Cui and Chi (2013) apply the same scheme from Rubinstein et al. (2013) to the Chinese Penn Treebank and get alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.81and 0.39 for sense and scope annotation, respectively.","Al-Sabbagh et al.

Furthermore, our annotation scheme is orthogonal to most of the aforementioned schemes. However, the key differences between our work and related work are: • We annotate nested modality, unlike Diab et al. (2009) and Baker et al. (2010, 2012).","• We use a wider range of negation and intensification markers compared to prior work, especially Al-Sabbagh et al.
