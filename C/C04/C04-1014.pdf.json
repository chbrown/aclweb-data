However, they can only capture the short distance context dependency within an n-words window where currently the largest practical n for a natural language is three while much of the context dependency in a natural language occurs beyond a three words window. In order to incorporate this kind of long distance context dependency in the ngram model of our Mandarin speech recognition system, this paper proposes a novel MI-Ngram modeling approach. This new MI-Ngram model consists of two components: a normal ngram model and a novel MI model. The ngram model captures the short distance context dependency within an n-words window while the MI model captures the context dependency between the word pairs over a long distance by using the concept of mutual information. That is, the MI-Ngram model incorporates the word occurrences beyond the scope of the normal ngram model. It is found that MI-Ngram modeling has much better performance than the normal word ngram modeling. Experimentation shows that about 20% of errors can be corrected by using a MI-Trigram model compared with the pure word trigram model. 1 Introduction Language modeling is the attempt to characterize, capture and exploit the regularities and constraints in a natural language and has been successfully applied to many domains. Among all the language modeling approaches, ngram models have been most widely used in speech recognition (Jelinek 1990; Gale and Church 1990; Brown et al. 1992; Yang et al. 1996) and other applications. While ngram models are simple in language modeling and have been successfully used in speech recognition and other tasks, they have obvious deficiencies. For instance, ngram models can only capture the short-distance dependency within an n-words window where currently the largest practical N for a natural language is three.","In the meantime, it is found that there always exist many preferred relationships between words. Two highly associated word pairs are “not only/but also” and “doctor/nurse”. Psychological experiments in Meyer D. et al. (1975) indicated that the human’s reaction to a highly associated word pair was stronger and faster than that to a poorly associated word pair. Such preference information is very useful for natural language processing (Church K.W. et al. 1990; Hiddle D. et al. 1993; Rosenfeld R. 1994 and Zhou G.D. et al.1998). Obviously, the preference relationships between words can expand from a short to long distance. While we can use conventional ngram models to capture the short distance dependency, the long distance dependency should also be exploited properly.","The purpose of this paper is to propose a new modeling approach to capture the context dependency over both a short distance and a long distance and apply it in Mandarin speech recognition.","This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the normal ngram modeling while a new modeling approach, named MI-ngram modeling, is proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, we will describe its use in our Mandarin speech recognition system. Finally we give a summary of this paper. 2 Ngram Modeling Let , where ’s are the words that make up the hypothesis, the m","m wwwwS ...211 == iw probability of the word string, , can be computed by using the chain rule: )(SP | 1","1−i i ww | 1","1−i i w 1−n )| 1−iw","ni w − 1 )...|( 11 −nn wwwP for all Vwww ni ∈,...,,1 .","Given mwwwS ...21= , an ngram model estimates the log probability of the word string, log , by re-writing Equation (2.2): )(SP"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["= − = m i i","i wwPwPSP 2 1 11 )|()()( (2.1)","By taking a log function to both sides of Equation (2.1), we have the log probability of the word string, log : )(SP"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["− = − += 1 2 1 11 )|(log)(log)(log n i i ingram wwPwPSP"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["= − +−+ m ni i nii wwP )|(log 1","1 (2.6)",")(log)(log)(log 2 1 ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["+= m i PwPSP (2.2) where is the string length, is the i -th word in the string . m iw","S","So, the classical task of statistical language modeling becomes how to effectively and efficiently predict the next word, given the previous words, that is to say, to estimate expressions of the form .

That is, those frequently occurring word pairs are more important and have much more potential to be incorporated into the MI-Ngram model than less frequently occurring word pairs. 4 Experimentation We have evaluated the new MI-Ngram model in an experimental speaker-dependent continuous Mandarin speech recognition system (Zhou G.D. et al 1999). For base syllable recognition, 14 cepstral and 14 delta-cepstral coefficients, energy(normalized) and delta-energy are used as feature parameters to form a feature vector with dimension 30, while for tone recognition, the pitch period and the energy together with their first order and second order delta coefficients are used to form a feature vector with dimension 6. All the acoustic units are modeled by semi-continuous HMMs (Rabiner 1993). For base syllable recognition, 138 HMMs are used to model 100 context-dependent INITIALs and 38 context-independent FINALs while 5 HMMs are used to model five different tones in Mandarin Chinese. 5,000 short sentences are used for training and another 600 sentences (6102 Chinese characters) are used for testing. All the training and testing data are recorded by one same speaker in an office-like laboratory environment with a sampling frequency of 16KHZ.","As a reference, the base syllable recognition rate and the tone recognition rate are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. As the word trigram model is most widely used in current research, all the experiments have been done using a MI-Trigram model which is trained on the XINHUA news corpus of 29 million words(automatically segmented) while the lexicon contains about 28000 words. As a result, the perplexities and Chinese character recognition rates of different MI-Trigram models with the same window size of 10 and different numbers of distance-dependent word pairs are shown in Table 4.","Table 2: The top-n recognition rates of base syllables Top-N Base Syllables 1 5 10 15 20","Recognition Rate of Base Syllables 88.2 97.6 99.2 99.5 99.8 ","Table 3: The recognition rates of the tones","tone 1 tone 2 tone 3 tone 4 tone 5 tone 1 90.4 0.8 0.6 0.8 7.4 tone 2 8.3 81.1 5.4 0.2 4.9 tone 3 5.0 20.9 43.0 29.1 2.0 tone 4 4.3 0.2 1.8 93.5 0.2 tone 5 24.1 8.6 0.9 8.2 58.2","Table 4: The effect of different numbers of word pairs in the MI-Trigram models with the same","window size 10 on the Chinese character recognition rates","Number of word pairs Perplexity Recognition Rate","0 204 90.5 100,000 196 91.2 200,000 189 91.7 400,000 183 92.1 600,000 179 92.3 800,000 175 92.4 1,000,000 172 92.5 1,500,000 171 92.5 2,000,000 170 92.6 2,500,000 170 92.5 3,000,000 168 92.6 3,500,000 169 92.6 4,000,000 168 92.7","Table 4 shows that the perplexity and the recognition rate rise quickly as the number of the long distance-dependent word pairs in the MI-Trigram model increase from 0 to 800,000, and then rise slowly. This suggests that the best 800,000 word pairs carry most of the long distance context dependency and should be included in the MI-Ngram model. It also shows that the recognition rate of the MI-Trigram model with 800,000 word pairs is 1.9% higher than the pure word trigram model (the MI-Trigram model with 0 long distance-dependent word pairs). That is to say, about 20% of errors can be corrected by incorporating only 800,000 word pairs to the MI-Trigram model compared with the pure word trigram model.","It is clear that MI-Ngram modeling has much better performance than normal word ngram modeling. One advantage of MI-Ngram modeling is that its number of parameters is just a little more than that of word ngram modeling. Another advantage of MI-Ngram modeling is that the number of the word pairs can be reasonable in size without losing too much of its modeling power. Compared to ngram modeling, MI-Ngram modeling also captures the long distance dependency of word pairs using the concept of mutual information. 4. CONCLUSION This paper proposes a novel MI-Ngram modeling approach to capture the context dependency over both a short distance and a long distance. This is done by incorporating long distance-dependent word pairs into normal ngram modeling by using the concept of mutual information. It is found that MI-Ngram modeling has much better performance than word ngram modeling.","REFERENCE","Brown P.F. et al. (1992). Class-based Ngram models of natural language.
