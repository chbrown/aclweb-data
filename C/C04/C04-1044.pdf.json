Polarization makes their resource sensitivity explicit and abstraction aims at keeping essentially the mechanism of neutralization between polarities. Parsing with the simplied grammar in the abstract formalism can be used eciently for ltering lexical selections."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["There is a complexity issue if one consider exact parsing with large scale lexicalized grammars. Indeed, the number of way of associating to each word of a sentence a corresponding elementary structure|a tagging of the sentence| is the product of the number of lexical entries for each word. The procedure may have an exponential complexity in the length of the sentence.","In order to lter taggings, we can use probabilistic methods (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) and keep only the most probable ones; but if we want to keep all successful taggings, we must use exact methods. Among these, one consists in abstracting information that is relevant for the ltering process, from the formalism F used for representing the concerned grammar G. In this way, we obtain a new formalism Fabs which is a simplication of F and the grammar G is translated into a grammar abs(G) in the abstract framework Fabs. From this, disambiguat-ing with G consists in parsing with abs(G). The abstraction is relevant if parsing eliminates a maximum of bad taggings at a minimal cost. (Boullier, 2003) uses such a method for Lexical-ized Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAG) by abstracting a tree adjoining grammar into a context free grammar and further abstracting that one into a regular grammar. We also propose to apply abstraction but after a preprocessing polarization step.","The notion of polarity comes from Categorial Grammars (Moortgat, 1996) which ground syntactic composition on the resource sensitivity of natural languages and it is highlighted in Interaction Grammars (Perrier, 2003), which result from rening and making Categorial Grammars more exible.","Polarization of a grammatical formalism F consists in adding polarities to its syntactic structures to obtain a polarized formalism Fpol in which neutralization of polarities is used for controlling syntactic composition. In this way, the resource sensitivity of syntactic composition is made explicit. (Kahane, 2004) shows that many grammatical formalisms can be polarized by generalizing the system of polarities used in Interaction Grammars.","To abstract a grammatical formalism, it is interesting to polarize it before because polarities allow original methods of abstraction.","The validity of our method is based on a concept of morphism (two instances of which being polarization and abstraction) which characterizes how one should transport a formalism into another.","In sections 1 and 2, we present the conceptual tools of grammatical formalism and morphism which are used in the following.","In section 3, we dene the operation of polarizing grammatical formalisms and in section 4, we describe how polarization is used then for abstracting these formalisms.","In section 5, we show how abstraction of grammatical formalisms grounds methods of lexical disambiguation, which reduce to parsing in simplied formalisms. We illustrate our purpose with an incremental and a bottom-up method.","In section 6, we present some experimental results which illustrate the exibility of the approach."]},{"title":"1 Characterization of a grammatical formalism","paragraphs":["Taking a slightly modied characterization of polarized unication grammars introduced by (Kahane, 2004) we dene a grammatical formalism F (not necessarily polarized) as a quadruple hStructF ; SatF ; PhonF ; RulesF i:","1. StructF is a set of syntactic structures which are graphs1","in which each edge and vertex may be associated with a label representing morpho-syntactic information; we assume that the set of labels associated with F is equipped with subsumption, a partial order denoted v, and with unication, an operation denoted t, such that, for any labels l and l0",", either l t l0","is not dened, which is denoted l t l0","= ?, or l t l0","is the least upper bound of l and l02",";","2. SatF is a subset of StructF , which represents the saturated syntactic structures of grammatical sentences;","3. PhonF is a function that projects every element of SatF in the sentence that has this element as its syntactic structure.","4. RulesF is a set of composition rules between syntactic structures. Every element of RulesF is a specic method for superposing parts of syntactic structures; this method denes the characteristics of the parts to be superposed and the unication operation between their labels. Notice that we do not ask rules to be deterministic. The composition rules of syntactic structures, viewed as superposition rules, have the fundamental property of monotonicity: they add information without removing it. Hence, the denition above applies only to formalisms that can be expressed as constraint systems in opposition to transformational systems.","Let us give some examples of grammatical formalisms that comply with the denition above by examining how they do it. In LTAG, StructLTAG represents the set of derived trees, SatLTAG the set of derived trees with a root in the category sentence and without non terminal leaves. 1 Usually trees or directed acyclic graphs. 2 The least upper bound of l and l0","can exist and, at","the same time, l t l0","be not dened; if the operation of","unication is dened everywhere, the set of labels is a","semi-lattice. The projection PhonLTAG is the canonical projection of a locally ordered tree on its leaves. Finally, RulesLTAG is made up of two rules: substitution and adjunction. To view adjunction as a superposition rule, we resort to the monotone presentation of LTAG with quasi-trees introduced by (Vijay-Shanker, 1992).","In Lambek Grammars (LG), StructLG is the set of partial proofs and these proofs can be represented in the form of incomplete Lambek proof nets labelled with phonological terms (de Groote, 1999). SatLG represents the set of complete proof nets with the category sentence as their conclusion and with syntactic categories labelled with words as their hypotheses. The projection PhonLG returns the label of the conclusion of complete proof nets. RulesLG is made up of two rules: a binary rule that consists in identifying two dual atomic formulas of two partial proof nets by means of an axiom link and a unary rule that consists in the same operation but inside the same partial proof net.","Now, inside a formalism dened as above, we can consider particular grammars: A grammar G of a formalism F is a subset G StructF of its elementary syntactic structures. A grammar is lexicalized if every element of G is anchored by a word in a lexicon. In LTAG, G is constituted of its initial and auxiliary trees. In LG, G is constituted of the syntactic trees of the formulas representing syntactic categories of words as hypotheses plus a partial proof net anchored by the period and including a conclusion in the category sentence.","From a grammar G dened in a formalism F , we build the set D(G) of its derived syntactic structures by applying the rules of RulesF recursively from the elements of G. The language generated by the grammar is the projection L(G) = PhonF (SatF \\ D(G))."]},{"title":"2 Morphisms between grammatical formalisms","paragraphs":["Polarization and abstraction can be dened from a more general notion of morphism between grammatical formalisms. A morphism from a grammatical formalism C to a grammatical formalism A is a function f from StructC to StructA with the following properties3",": (i) f (SatC ) SatA; (ii) 8S 2 SatC ; PhonA(f (S)) = PhonC (S);","(iii) if S1; : : : ; Sn are composed into a structure S in C by means of rules of RulesC , then f (S1); : : : ; f (Sn) can be composed into the structure f (S) by means of rules of RulesA. Given such a morphism f and a grammar G in C, the image of G by f denoted f (G) is the grammar|in A|induced by the morphism. The three properties of morphism guarantee that the language generated by any grammar G of C is a subset of the language generated by f (G). In other words, L(G) L(f (G)).","We propose to use the notion of morphism in two ways:","for polarizing grammatical formalisms and in this case, morphisms are isomorphisms; grammars are transposed from a formalism to another formalism with the same generative power; in other words, with the previous notations: L(G) = L(f (G));","for abstracting grammatical formalisms and this case, the transposition of grammars by morphisms entails simplication of grammars and extension of the generated languages; we have only: L(G) L(f (G)). An example of the use of abstraction for lexical disambiguation may be found in (Boullier, 2003)4",". We propose to link polarization with abstraction because polarities allow original methods of abstraction. Polarization is used as a preprocessing step before the application of these methods."]},{"title":"3 Polarization of grammatical formalisms","paragraphs":["The goal of polarizing a grammatical formalism is to make explicit the resource sensitivity that is hidden in syntactic composition, by adding polarities to the labels of its structures. When morpho-syntactic labels become polarized in syntactic structures, they get the status 3 An elegant denition of morphism could be given","in a category-theoretical framework but we have chosen","here a more elementary denition. 4 Our denition of morphism must be slightly ex-","tended for embedding the proposal of (Boullier, 2003). of consumable resources: a label that is associated with the polarity + becomes an available resource whereas a label that is associated with the polarity becomes an expected resource; both combine for producing a saturated resource associated with the polarity $; labels associated with the polarity = are neutral in this process. In a polarized formalism, the saturated structures are those that have all labels associated with the polarity = or $. We call them neutral structures. The composition of structures is guided by a principle of neutralization: every positive (negative) label must unify with a negative (positive) label.","The polarization of a formalism must preserve its generative power: the language that is generated by a polarized grammar must be the same as that generated by the initial non-polarized grammar. This property of (weak and even strong) equivalence is guaranteed if the polarized formalism is isomorphic to the non-polarized formalism from which it stems. For-mally, given a grammatical formalism F , any formalism Fpol with a morphism pol : F ! Fpol is a polarization of F if:","(i) For any structure S 2 StructF , pol(S) results from associating each label of S with one of the polarities: +, , =, $; in others words, labels of Fpol are pairs (p; l) with p a polarity and l a label of F . The set of polarities f+, , =, $g is equipped with the operation of unication and the subsumption order dened by Figure 1.

Let us illustrate our purpose by taking again our two examples of formalisms.","For LTAG (see gure 2), pol consists in labelling the root of elementary syntactic trees with the polarity + and their non terminal leaves (substitution and foot nodes)","+ = $ $ + $ + = + = $ $ $","= . & + & .","$ Figure 1: unication and subsumption between polarities pol destr N N*Adj red N− N+ N+ Adj N− red","N+, N+, N−, N− red , Adj Figure 2: Syntactic structures associated with the adjective red in LTAG, LTAGpol, (LTAGpol)destr with the polarity . In every pair of quasi-nodes, the top quasi-node is labelled with the polarity and the bottom quasi-node is labelled with the polarity +. With respect to the classical presentation of LTAG, initial trees must be completed by an axiom with two nodes of the type sentence: a root with the polarity = and its unique daughter with the polarity . In this way, pol establishes a perfect bijection between the saturated structures of LTAG and the neutral structures of LTAGpol. The rules of adjunction and substitution of RulesLTAGpol mimic the corresponding rules in LTAG, taking into account polarities. We add a third composition rule, a unary rule which identies the two quasi-nodes of a same pair. It is routine to check that pol is a polarisation.","In LG(see gure 3), polarization is already present explicitly in the formalism: negative formulas and sub-formulas are input formulas, hypotheses whereas positive formulas and sub-formulas are output formulas, conclusions."]},{"title":"4 Abstraction of polarized grammatical formalisms","paragraphs":["The originality of abstracting polarized formalisms is to keep a mechanism of neutralization between opposite polarities at the heart of the abstract formalism.

Destructuring a polarized formalism consists in ignoring the structure from the initial syntactic objects to keep merely the multisets of polarized labels. For-mally, given a polarized formalism P , we dene the formalism Pdestr as follows:","Any element M of StructPdestr is a multi-set of labels. All elements of M are labels of P , except one exactly, the anchor, which is a neutral string.","SatPdestr is made up of multisets containing only neutral and saturated labels;","The projection PhonPdestr returns the label of the anchor.","RulesPdestr has two neutralization rules. A binary rule takes two multisets M1 and M2 from StructPdestr as inputs; two uniable labels +l1 2 M1(M2) and l2 2 M2(M1) are selected. The rule returns the union of M1 and M2 in which +l1 and l2 are unied and the two anchors are concatenated. The only change with the unary rule is that this operates inside the same multiset. A morphism destr is associated to Pdestr (see gure 2 and 3): it takes any structure S from StructP as input and returns the multiset of its labels with an additionnal anchor. This anchor is the neutral string PhonP (S) if this one is dened.","An important property of Pdestr is that it is not sensitive to word order: if a sentence is generated by a particular grammar of Pdestr, by permuting the words of the sentence, we obtain another sentence generated by the grammar. Destructuring is an abstraction that applies to any polarized formalism but we can design abstractions with lower degree which are specic to particular formalisms (see Section 6)."]},{"title":"5 Application to lexical disambiguation","paragraphs":["Abstraction is the basis for a general method of lexical disambiguation. Given a lexicalized grammar G in a concrete formalism C, we consider a sentence w1 : : : wn. For each 1 i n, let the word wi have the following entries in the lexicon of G: Si;1; Si;2 : : : Si;mi. A tagging of the sentence is a sequence S1;k1; S2;k2 : : : Sn;kn. We suppose now that we have given an abstraction morphism abs : C ! Cabs. As L(G) L(abs(G)), any tagging in abs(G) which has no solutions comes from a bad tagging in G. As a consequence, the methods we develop try to eliminate such bad taggings by parsing the sentence w1w2 : : : wn within the grammar abs(G).","We propose two procedures for parsing in the abstract formalism:","an incremental procedure which is specic to the destructuring abstraction,","a bottom-up procedure which can apply to various formalisms and abstractions. 5.1 Incremental procedure We choose polarization followed by destructuring as abstraction. In other words: abs = destr pol. Let us start with the particular case where unication of labels in C reduces to identity. In this case, parsing inside the formalism Cabs is greatly simplied because composition rules reduce to the neutralization of two labels +l and l. As a consequence, parsing reduces to a counting of positive and negative polarities present in the selected tagging for every label l: every positive label counts for +1 and every negative label for {1, the sum must be 0; since this counting must be done for every possible tagging and for every possible label, it is crucial to factorize counting. For this, we use automata, which drastically decrease the space (and also the time) complexity.","For every label l of C that appears with a polarity + or in the possible taggings of the sentence w1w2 : : : wn, we build the automaton Al as follows. The set of states of Al is [0::n]Z. For any state (i; c), i represents the position at the beginning of the word wi+1 in the sentence and c represents a positive or negative count of labels l. The initial state is (0; 0), and the nal state is (n; 0). Transitions are labeled by lexicon entries Si;j. Given any Si;j, there is a transition (i 1; x) Si;j ! (i; y) if y is the sum of x and the","count of labels l in the multi-set destr(Si;j).","Reaching state (i; c) from the initial state (0; 0) means that","(a) the path taken is of the form S1;j1; S2;j2; : : : ; Si;ji, that is a tagging of the rst i words,","(b) c is the count of labels l present in the union of the multi-sets abs(S1;j1); abs(S2;j2); : : : ; abs(Si;ji). As a consequence, any path that leads to the - nal state corresponds to a neutral choice of tagging for this label l.","The algorithm is now simply to construct for each label l the automaton Al and to make the intersection A = T","l2Labels Al of all these automata. The result of the disambiguation is the set of paths from the initial state to the - nal state described by this intersection automaton. Notice that at each step of the construction of the intersection, one should prune automata from their blind states to ensure the eciency of the procedure.","Now, in the general case, unication of labels in F does not reduce to identication, which in-troduces nondeterminism in the application of the neutralization rule. Parsing continues to reduce to counting polarities but now the counting of dierent labels is nondeterministic and interdependent. For instance, consider the multiset f+a, +b, at+bg of three dierent elements. If we count the number of a, we nd 0 if we consider that +a is neutralized by atb and +1 otherwise; in the rst case, we nd +1 for the count of b and in the second case, we nd 0. Interdependency between the counts of dierent labels is very costly to be taken into account and in the following we ignore this property; therefore, in the previous exemple, we consider that the count of a is 0 or +1 and the count of b is also 0 or +1 independently from the rst one. For expressing this, given a label l of F and a positive or negative label l0","of F","pol, we dene","Pl(l0 ) as a segment of integers, which represents","the possible counts of l found in l0",", as follows:","if l0 is positive, then P","l(l0 ) = 8 < : J1; 1K if lvl0 J0; 0K if ltl0","= ? J0; 1K otherwise","if l0 is negative, then P","l(l0 ) = 8 < :","J1; 1K if lvl0 J0; 0K if ltl0","= ? J1; 0K otherwise We generalize the function Pl to count the number ol labels l present in a multi-set abs(S): Pl(S) = Jinf; supKwith:","inf =","P l0 2abs(S) min(Pl(l0",")) sup =","P","l0","2abs(S) max(Pl(l0","))","The method of disambiguation using au-","tomata presented above is still valid in the gen-","eral case with the following change in the deni-","tion of a transition in the automaton Al: given any Si;j, there is a transition (i 1; x)","Si;j","! (i; y) if y is the sum of x and some element of Pl(Si;j). With this change, the automaton Al becomes nondeterministic.","The interest of the incremental procedure is that it is global to the sentence and that it ignores word order. This feature is interesting for generation where the question of disambiguation is crucial. This advantage is at the same time its drawback when we need to take word order and locality into account. Under this an-gle, the bottom-up procedure, which will be presented below, is a good complement to the incremental procedure. 5.2 Bottom-up procedure We propose here another procedure adapted to a formalism C with the property of projectivity. Because of this property, it is possible to use a CKY-like algorithm in the abstract formalism Cabs. To parse a sentence w1w2 wn, we construct items of the form (i; j; S) with S an element of StructCabs and i and j such that wi+1 : : : wj represents the phonological form of S. We assume that Rules(Cabs) has only unary and binary rules. Then, three rules are used for lling the chart:","initialization: the chart is initialized with items in the form (i; i + 1; abs(Si+1;k));","reduction: if the chart contains an item (i; j; S), we add the item (i; j; S0",") such that S0","is obtained by application of a unary composition rule to S;","concatenation: if the chart contains two item (i; j; S) and (j; k; S0","), we add the item (i; k; S00",") such that S00","is obtained by application of a binary composition rule to S and S0",". Parsing succeeds if the chart contains an item in the form (0; n; S0) such that S0 is an element of SatCabs. From such an item, we can recover all taggings that are at its source if, for every application of a rule, we keep a pointer from the conclusion to the corresponding premisses. The other taggings are eliminated."]},{"title":"6 Experiments","paragraphs":["In order to validate our methodology, we have written two toy English grammars for the LG and the LTAG formalisms.

In this way, some neutralizations possible in the destr abstraction are not possible anymore if the two polarities have incompatible constraints (i.e. lie in dierent segments).
