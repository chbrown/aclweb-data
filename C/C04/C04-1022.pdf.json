Such languages typically exhibit a large number of word types in relation to word tokens in a given text, which leads to high perplexity and a large number of unseen word contexts. As a result, probability estimates are often unreliable, even when using standard smoothing and parameter reduction techniques. Recently, a new language modeling approach, called factored language models (FLMs), has been developed. FLMs are a generalization of standard language models in that they allow a larger set of conditioning variables for predicting the current word. In addition to the preceding words, any number of additional variables can be included (e.g. morphological, syntactic, or semantic word features). Since such features are typically shared across multiple words, they can be used to obtained better smoothed probability estimates when training data is sparse. However, the space of possible models is extremely large, due to many dierent ways of choosing subsets of conditioning word features, backo procedures, and discounting methods. Usually, this space cannot be searched exhaustively, and optimizing models by a knowledge-inspired manual search procedure often leads to suboptimal results since only a small portion of the search space can be explored. In this paper we investigate the possibility of determining the structure of factored language models (i.e. the set of conditioning variables, the backo procedure and the discounting parameters) by a data-driven search procedure, viz. Genetic Algorithms (GAs). We apply this technique to two dierent tasks (language modeling for Arabic and Turkish) and show that GAs lead to better models than either knowledge-inspired manual search or random search. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the details of the factored language modeling approach. The application of GAs to the problem of determining language model structure is explained in Section 3. The corpora used in the present study are described in Section 4 and experiments and results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 compares the present study to related work and Section 7 concludes."]},{"title":"2 Factored Language Models","paragraphs":["A standard statistical language model computes the probability of a word sequence W = w1; w2; :::; wT as a product of conditional probabilities of each word wi given its history, which is typically approximated by just one or two preceding words (leading to bigrams, and trigrams, respectively). Thus, a trigram language model is described by p(w1; :::; wT ) T Y i=3 p(wijwi1; wi2) (1) Even with this limitation, the estimation of the required probabilities is challenging: many word contexts may be observed infrequently or not at all, leading to unreliable probability estimates under maximum likelihood estimation. Several techniques have been developed to address this problem, in particular smoothing techniques (Chen and Goodman, 1998) and class-based language models (Brown and others, 1992). In spite of such parameter reduction techniques, language modeling remains a dicult task, in particular for morphologically rich languages, e.g. Turkish, Russian, or Arabic. Such languages have a large number of word types in relation to the number of word tokens in a given text, as has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies (Geutner, 1995; Kiecza et al., 1999; Hakkani-Tur et al., 2002; Kirchho et al., 2003). This in turn results in a high perplexity and in a large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words when applying a trained language model to a new unseen text. 2.1 Factored Word Representations A recently developed approach that addresses this problem is that of Factored Language Models (FLMs) (Kirchho et al., 2002; Bilmes and Kirchho, 2003), whose basic idea is to decompose words into sets of features (or factors) instead of viewing them as unanalyzable wholes. Probabilistic language models can then be constructed over (sub)sets of word features instead of, or in addition to, the word variables themselves. For instance, words can be decomposed into stems/lexemes and POS tags indicating their morphological features, as shown below: Word: Stock prices are rising Stem: Stock price be rise Tag: Nsg N3pl V3pl Vpart Such a representation serves to express lexical and syntactic generalizations, which would otherwise remain obscured. It is comparable to class-based representations employed in standard class-based language models; however, in FLMs several simultaneous class assignments are allowed instead of a single one. In general, we assume that a word is equivalent to a xed number (K) of factors, i.e. W f1:K . The task then is to produce a statistical model over the resulting representation - using a trigram approximation, the resulting probability model is as follows:","p(f 1:K","1 ; f 1:K","2 ; :::; f 1:K","T ) T Y t=3","p(f 1:K","t jf 1:K","t1 ; f 1:K","t2 ) (2) Thus, each word is dependent not only on a single stream of temporally ordered word variables, but also on additional parallel (i.e. simultaneously occurring) features. This factored representation can be used in two dierent ways to improve over standard LMs: by using a product model or a backo model. In a product model, Equation 2 can be simplied by nding conditional independence assumptions among subsets of conditioning factors and computing the desired probability as a product of individual models over those subsets. In this paper we only consider the second option, viz. using the factors in a backo procedure when the word n-gram is not observed in the training data. For instance, a word trigram that is found in an unseen test set may not have any counts in the training set, but its corresponding factors (e.g. stems and morphological tags) may have been observed since they also occur in other words. 2.2 Generalized parallel backo Backo is a common smoothing technique in language modeling. It is applied whenever the count for a given n-gram in the training data falls below a certain threshold . In that case, the maximum-likelihood estimate of the n-gram probability is replaced with a probability derived from the probability of the lower-order (n 1)-gram and a backo weight. N-grams whose counts are above the threshold retain their maximum-likelihood estimates, discounted by a factor that re-distributes probability mass to the lower-order distribution: pBO(wtjwt1; wt2) (3) =  dcpML(wtjwt1; wt2) if c > 3 (wt1; wt2)pBO(wtjwt1) otherwise where c is the count of (wt; wt1; wt2), pML denotes the maximum-likelihood estimate and dc is a discounting factor that is applied to the higher-order distribution. The way in which the discounting factor is estimated determines the actual smoothing method (e.g. Good-Turing, Kneser-Ney, etc.) The normalization factor (wt1; wt2) ensures that the entire distribu-tion sums to one. During standard backo, the most distant conditioning variable (in this case wt2) is dropped rst, then the second most distant variable etc. until the unigram is reached. This can be visualized as a backo path (Figure 1(a)). If the only variables in the model are words, such a backo procedure is reasonable. tW 1tW− 2tW− 3tW− tW 1tW− 2tW− tW 1tW− tW (a)","F 1F 2F","3F F","F","1F","2F F 1F","3F F","2F","3F","F","1F F","3FF","2F (b) Figure 1: Standard backo path for a 4-gram language model over words (left) and backo graph for 4-gram over factors (right). However, if variables occur in parallel, i.e. do not form a temporal sequence, it is not immediately obvious in which order they should be dropped. In this case, several backo paths are possible, which can be summarized in a backo graph (Figure 1(b)). In principle, there are several dierent ways of choosing among dierent paths in this graph: 1. Choose a xed, predetermined backo path based on linguistic knowledge, e.g. always drop syntactic before morphological variables. 2. Choose the path at run-time based on statistical criteria. 3. Choose multiple paths and combine their probability estimates. The last option, referred to as parallel backo, is implemented via a new, generalized backo function (here shown for a 4-gram): pGBO(f jf1; f2; f3) (4) =  dcpML(f jf1; f2; f3) if c > 4 (f1; f2; f3)g(f; f1; f2; f3) otherwise where c is the count of (f; f1; f2; f3), pML(f jf1; f2; f3) is the maximum likelihood distribution, 4 is the count threshold, and (f1; f2; f3) is the normalization factor. The function g(f; f1; f2; f3) determines the backo strategy. In a typical backo procedure g(f; f1; f2; f3) equals pBO(f jf1; f2). In generalized parallel backo, however, g can be any non-negative function of f; f1; f2; f3. In our implementation of FLMs (Kirchho et al., 2003) we consider several dierent g functions, including the mean, weighted mean, product, and maximum of the smoothed probability distributions over all subsets of the conditioning factors. In addition to dierent choices for g, dierent discounting parameters can be chosen at dierent levels in the backo graph. For instance, at the topmost node, Kneser-Ney discounting might be chosen whereas at a lower node Good-Turing might be applied. FLMs have been implemented as an add-on to the widely-used SRILM toolkit1","and have been used successfully for the purpose of morpheme-based language modeling (Bilmes and Kirchho, 2003), multi-speaker language modeling (Ji and Bilmes, 2004), and speech recognition (Kirchho et al., 2003)."]},{"title":"3 Learning FLM Structure","paragraphs":["In order to use an FLM, three types of parameters need to be specied: the initial conditioning factors, the backo graph, and the smoothing options. The goal of structure learn-ing is to nd the parameter combinations that create FLMs that achieve a low perplexity on unseen test data. The resulting model space is extremely large: given a factored word representation with a total of k factors, there arePk","n=1 k n ","possible subsets of initial conditioning factors. For a set of m conditioning factors, there are up to m! backo paths, each with its own smoothing options. Unless m is very small, exhaustive search is infeasible. Moreover, non-linear interactions between parameters make it dicult to guide the search into a particular direction, and parameter sets that work well for one corpus cannot necessarily be expected to perform well on another. We therefore need an automatic way of identifying the best model structure. In the following section, we describe the application of genetic-based search to this problem. 3.1 Genetic Algorithms Genetic Algorithms (GAs) (Holland, 1975) are a class of evolution-inspired search/optimization techniques. They perform particularly well in problems with complex, poorly understood search spaces. The fundamental idea of GAs is to encode problem solutions as (usually binary) strings (genes), and to evolve and test successive populations of solutions through the use of genetic operators applied to the encoded strings. Solutions are evaluated according to a tness function which represents the desired optimization criterion. The individual steps are as fol-","1","We would like to thank Je Bilmes for providing and supporting the software. lows: Initialize: Randomly generate a set (population) of strings. While tness improves by a certain threshold: Evaluate tness: calculate each string’s tness Apply operators: apply the genetic operators to create a new population. The genetic operators include the probabilistic selection of strings for the next generation, crossover (exchanging subparts of dierent strings to create new strings), and mutation (randomly altering individual elements in strings). Although GAs provide no guarantee of nding the optimal solution, they often nd good solutions quickly. By maintaining a population of solutions rather than a single solution, GA search is robust against premature convergence to local optima. Furthermore, solutions are optimized based on a task-specic tness function, and the probabilistic nature of genetic operators helps direct the search towards promising regions of the search space. 3.2 Structure Search Using GA In order to use GAs for searching over FLM structures (i.e. combinations of conditioning variables, backo paths, and discounting options), we need to nd an appropriate encoding of the problem. Conditioning factors The initial set of conditioning factors F are encoded as binary strings. For instance, a trigram for a word representation with three factors (A,B,C) has six conditioning variables: fA1; B1; C1; A2; B2; C2g which can be represented as a 6-bit binary string, with a bit set to 1 indicating presence and 0 indicating absence of a factor in F . The string 10011 would correspond to F = fA1; B2; C2g. Backo graph The encoding of the backo graph is more difcult because of the large number of possible paths. A direct approach encoding every edge as a bit would result in overly long strings, rendering the search inecien t. Our solution is to encode a binary string in terms of graph grammar rules (similar to (Kitano, 1990)), which can be used to describe common regularities in backo graphs. For instance, a node with m factors can only back o to children nodes with m 1 factors. For m = 3, the choices for proceeding to the next-lower level in the backo 1. {X1 X2 X3} −> {X1 X2} 2. {X1 X2 X3} −> {X1 X3} 3. {X1 X2 X3} −> {X2 X3} 4. {X1 X2} −> {X1} 5. {X1 X2} −> {X2} PRODUCTION RULES: AB ABC AB ABC BC AB ABC BC A B AB ABC BC A B             0 1 4 4"]},{"title":"10110","paragraphs":["3 (b) Generation of Backoff Graph by rules 1, 3, and 4 (a) Gene activates production rules GENE: Figure 2: Generation of Backo Graph from production rules selected by the gene 10110. graph can thus be described by the following grammar rules: RULE 1: fx1; x2; x3g ! fx1; x2g RULE 2: fx1; x2; x3g ! fx1; x3g RULE 3: fx1; x2; x3g ! fx2; x3g Here xi corresponds to the factor at the ith position in the parent node. Rule 1 indicates a backo that drops the third factor, Rule 2 drops the second factor, etc. The choice of rules used to generate the backo graph is encoded in a binary string, with 1 indicating the use and 0 indicating the non-use of a rule, as shown schematically in Figure 2. The presence of two dierent rules at the same level in the backo graph corresponds to parallel backo; the absence of any rule (strings consisting only of 0 bits) implies that the corresponding backo graph level is skipped and two conditioning variables are dropped simultaneously. This allows us to encode a graph using few bits but does not represent all possible graphs. We cannot selectively apply dierent rules to dierent nodes at the same level { this would essentially require a context-sensitive grammar, which would in turn increase the length of the encoded strings. This is a fundamental tradeo between the most general representation and an encoding that is tractable. Our experimental results described below conrm, however, that sucien tly good results can be obtained in spite of the above limitation. Smoothing options Smoothing options are encoded as tuples of in-tegers. The rst integer species the discounting method while second indicates the minimum count required for the n-gram to be included in the FLM. The integer string consists of successive concatenated tuples, each representing the smoothing option at a node in the graph. The GA operators are applied to concatenations of all three substrings describing the set of factors, backo graph, and smoothing options, such that all parameters are optimized jointly."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["We tested our language modeling algorithms on two dierent data sets from two dierent languages, Arabic and Turkish.","The Arabic data set was drawn from the CallHome Egyptian Conversational Arabic (ECA) corpus (LDC, 1996). The training, development, and evaluation sets contain approximately 170K, 32K, and 18K words, respectively. The corpus was collected for the purpose of speech recognizer development for conversational Arabic, which is mostly dialectal and does not have a written standard. No additional text material beyond transcriptions is available in this case; it is therefore important to use language models that perform well in sparse data conditions. The factored representation was constructed using linguistic information from the corpus lexicon, in combination with automatic morphological analysis tools. It includes, in addition to the word, the stem, a morphological tag, the root, and the pattern. The latter two are components which when combined form the stem. An example of this factored word representation is shown below: Word:il+dOr/Morph:noun+masc-sg+article/ Stem:dOr/Root:dwr/Pattern:CCC For our Turkish experiments we used a morphologically annotated corpus of Turkish (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2000). The annotation was performed by applying a morphological analyzer, followed by automatic morphological disambiguation as described in (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2002). The morphological tags consist of the initial root, followed by a sequence of inectional groups delimited by derivation boundaries (D̂B). A sample annotation (for the word yararlanmak, consisting of the root yarar plus three inectional groups) is shown below: yararmanlak: yarar+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom","D̂B+Verb+Acquire+Pos D̂B+Noun+Inf+A3sg+Pnon+Nom We removed segmentation marks (for titles and paragraph boundaries) from the corpus but included punctuation. Words may have dierent numbers of inectional groups, but the FLM representation requires the same number of factors for each word; we therefore had to map the original morphological tags to a xed-length factored representation. This was done using linguistic knowledge: according to (Oazer, 1999), the nal inectional group in each dependent word has a special status since it determines inectional markings on head words following the dependent word. The nal inectional group was therefore analyzed into separate factors indicating the number (N), case (C), part-of-speech (P) and all other information (O). Additional factors for the word are the root (R) and all remaining information in the original tag not subsumed by the other factors (G). The word itself is used as another factor (W). Thus, the above example would be factorized as follows: W:yararlanmak/R:yarar/P:NounInf-N:A3sg/ C:Nom/O:Pnon/G:NounA3sgPnonNom+Verb +Acquire+Pos Other factorizations are certainly possible; however, our primary goal is not to nd the best possible encoding for our data but to demonstrate the eectiveness of the FLM approach, which is largely independent of the choice of factors. For our experiments we used subsets of 400K words for training, 102K words for development and 90K words for evaluation."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["In our application of GAs to language model structure search, the perplexity of models with respect to the development data was used as an optimization criterion.

However, in all of these studies words were decomposed into linear sequences of morphs or morph-like units, using either linguistic knowledge or data-driven techniques. Standard language models were then trained on the decomposed representations. The resulting models essentially express statistical relationships between morphs, such as stems and axes. For this reason, a context larger than that provided by a trigram is typically required, which quickly leads to data-sparsity. In contrast to these approaches, factored language models encode morphological knowledge not by altering the linear segmentation of words but by encoding words as parallel bundles of features.","The general possibility of using multiple conditioning variables (including variables other than words) has also been investigated by (Dupont and Rosenfeld, 1997; Gildea, 2001; Wang, 2003; Zitouni et al., 2003). Mostly, the additional variables were general word classes derived by data-driven clustering procedures, which were then arranged in a backo lattice or graph similar to the present procedure. All of these studies assume a xed path through the graph, which is usually obtained by an ordering from more specic probability distributions to more general distributions. Some schemes also allow two or more paths to be combined by weighted interpolation. FLMs, by contrast, allow dierent paths to be chosen at run-time, they support a wider range of combination methods for probability estimates from dierent paths, and they oer a choice of different discounting options at every node in the backo graph. Most importantly, however, the present study is to our knowledge the rst to describe an entirely data-driven procedure for identifying the best combination of parameter choices. The success of this method will facilitate the rapid development of FLMs for dierent tasks in the future."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have presented a data-driven approach to the selection of parameters determining the structure and performance of factored language models, a class of models which generalizes standard language models by including additional conditioning variables in a principled way.
