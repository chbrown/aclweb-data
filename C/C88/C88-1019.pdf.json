In this paper we describe at project which we are now conducting on the acquisition of semantic inlbrmation ti'om computerized dictionaries. 2. I)ata and estal)lished methods fiw hierarchic'd semantic classifying The data we use in our research include the lexical information contained in the Italian Machine I)ictionary (I)MI), which is ah'eady structured as a LI)B and is nrainly based on the Zingarelli Italian dictionary (1970); the DM l-l)B has different types o[\" linguistic inIormation already accessible on-line. A morphological module generates and analy,'es the intlected word-forms: approximately I million fiom 120,000 lemmas, l.cnm/as, word-forms, deriwitivcs/suflixes, POS, usage codes, and specialized terminology codes, can be used its direct access search keys through which the user can query the database dictionary. On the semantic side, synonyms, hyponyms, and hypcrnyms constitute already implemented access paths covering all of the approximately 200,000 definitions contained in the dictionary. Examples of possible queries arc the lbllowing: give me all the nouns defined as names of vehicles, of sounds, of games, all the verbs defined by a particular genus term, for example 'M UOVEII.E' (to move), 'TAGLIARI.:' (to cut), etc. The procedures used to find B7 hypernyms in definitions and to create taxonomies are similar to those used by other groups (see Chodorow 1985, Calzolari 1983, Amslcr 1981). We have now begun work on restructuring another dictionary available in MRF, the Garzanti Italian dictionary (1984). A parser has been implemented which, on the basis of the typesetting codes for photocomposition, identifies the rough structure of each lexical entry. Fig. 1 displays the output of a parsed entry of the Garzanti dictionary. Fig. 2 represents the provisional model for a monolingual lexical entry as we have defined it so far. Fig. 3 gives the projection of the first interpretation of the typesetting codes into this model; other kinds of information will be added afterwards (for example, that obtained by the inductive procedures described in the paper). ............................................................

Fig. 3 - Example of a parsed Entry. 88 The merging of part of the data of tile DM I and the Garzanti dictionary into a single LI)B has already been completed, e.g. for lemmas, POSs, usage codes, etc. We now have to tackle the problcm of reorganizing the semantic data (dcfinitions and examples). Itcre our strategy is to design a new procedural system which is ablc to gradually \"learn\" and acquire semantic infornlation from dictionary definitions, going well bcyond thc IS-A hierarchies constructed so far, in order to attempt to also capturc what is prescnt in the \"diffcrcntia\" part of the definition. This can be achieved with some success given the particular nature of lexicographic definitions, with: a) a generic (and pe'rhaps over simplistic) description of the \"world\"; b) a rather lcxically and syntactically constrained and a somewhat regular natural language tcxt (Calzolari 1984, Wilks 1987). After having mappcd the codcs for photocomposition into linguistically relevant codes, all the preliminarily parsed data of the Garzanti have been organized on a PC in the form of a Textual Database (DBrl'), a fuEl-text Information Retrieval (IR) system in which all occurrences of any word-form or lermna can be directly accessed (Picchi 1983). The I)BT has been found to be a very powerful tool in evidencing lexical units and particular syntagms which can then be exploited in our \"pattern-matching\" procedure. With the text in DBT form it is possible to search occurrences of single word-forms in definitions and examples, lemmas, codes of various types (POS, specialized languages, usage labels, etc.), and also cooccurrences of any of these items throughout the entire dictionary. In addition, structures composed of combinations of the above elements connected by the logical operators \"and\" and \"or\" to any degree of complexity can also be searched. The results of such queries are returned together with the pertinent dictionary entries. Obviously frequencies can also be obtained. All this information can be retrieved with Fast interactive access. We have therefore already implemented two types of organization for dictionary data: 1) DB-type organization with the DM1 (we have not used a standard DBMS, but an ad hoc designed relational 1)B system); 2) a full-text IR system for the Garzanti dictionary. Although both types of organization have proved to be very powerful tools for different scopes, at tile same time each presents certain drawbacks and difficulties, due to the particular nature of dictionary data which in neither case has it been possible to fully exploit. Dictionary data is in fact of a very particular nature, consisting of a combination of free text in a highly organized structure. The DB approach copes well with the second characteristic, while the [R approach is successful in handling free text. tlowever neither is capable of fully exploiting the two features in combination. A new method must be envisaged, capable of reorganizing free text into elaborately structured information: this could be called the Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) approach, and is the aim of the project described here. 3. Techniques fi~r word-sense acquisition","Discow:ry procedure techniques prove to be useful in extracting semantic information from definition texts. In general, our approach consists in starting from fi'ee-tcxt definitions, in natural languagc linear form, analyzing and converting them into inlormationally equivalent structured tbrms. The preliminary step of the work consisted in applying the morphological analyzer to the definitions; tim result of this process tbr one definition appears in Fig. 4. A program designed for homograph disambignation was then run on the otput produced by this morphological processor. The disambiguator consists partly in rules generally valid for Italian, based on the immediate right and left context, and partly in ad hoc rules written for the particular syntax used in lexicographic definitions. Fig. 5 shows the result of applying this disambiguation procedure to all the homographs shown in the preceding example. We then had to implement a set of discovery procedures acting on dictionary definitions.","Entry ( EDITORE )","Def ( che o chi stampa e pubblica libri, periodici o musica, a scopo commereiale) F ( che ) L (che, ['PR' ,['NN'] ], ['PT' ,['NS'] ],","['DT' ,['NN'] ], ['DE' ,['NN'] ],","['PI' ,['MS'] ], ['C ' ,[' '2 ] ) F(o) L (o, ['SN' ,['NS'] ], ['C ' ,[' '] ],","['I ' ,[' '] ] ) F ( chl ) L (chi, ['PR' ,['NS'] ] ) F ( stampa ) L [stampa, ['SF' ,['FS'] ] ) L (stampare, ['VTP' ,['S31P','S2MP'] ] ) F(e) t (e, ['SN' ,['NS'] ], ['CC' ,[' '] ] ) F ( pubblica ) L (pubblico, ['A' ,['FS '1 ] ) L (pubblicare, ['VT' ,['S31P','S2MP'] ] ) F ( libri ) L (libro, ['SM' ,['MP'] ] ) L (librare, ['VTR' ,['S21P','SICP',","'S2CP','S3CP'] ] ) P[,) F ( periodici ) L (periodico, ['A ' ,['MP'] ], ['SM' ,['MP'] ] ) F(o) L (o, ['SN' ,['NS'] ], ['C ' ,[' '1 1,","'l ' ,[' '] ] ) F ( musica ) L (musica, ['SF' ,['FS'] ] ) L (muslcare, ['VTI' ,['S31P','S2NP'] ] ) I'(, ) F(a) L (a, ['SN' ,['NN'] ], ['E ' ,[' '] ] ) I-"]},{"title":"[ scopo ) L (scope, ['SM' ,['MS'] ] ) L (scopare, ['VT' ,['SLIP'] ] ) F ( commereiale ) L (eommerciale, ['A' ,['NS '] ] )","paragraphs":["..........................................................

The search is then driven by these lists of patterns to handle the grammatical and lexical variations. The \"pattcn>nmtching\" strategy has bccn obviously integrated with the Italian morphological analyzer to handle inflectional variation. The patterns may contain either l.abcls, or Lemmas, or Word-tbrms. For the Labels, the system searches for all the associated lcmmas and all their word-fornas (unless otherwise spccificd); in the same way l.emmas are automatically expanded to cover their inllccted word-fo,'ms, Generally, wc look for recurring patterns in the definitions and attempt to associate them with corresponding relations or conceptual categories.

The results of a first run through the whole dictionary using an initial set of patterns can afterwards be recursively revised when new data are acquired. Our practical global research strategy is to develop a system which at the beginning has only a generalized expertise. This system obviously breaks down at many points on its first rtm; we can then evaluate all these 90 points, and consider when and where measures must be taken to overcome specilic difficulties. In this way, ncw capabilities can be added incrementally to the system so that gradually it is able to cope with increasingly difficult data. Thus wc systematically add new \"knowledge\" to the system, prompted each time by a failure to cope with the given data. It seems to us that this is a practical research strategy For cliciting and modelling vague and fuzzy knowledge. liven though the methodological approach has been deliberately simplified at the beginning (in order to introduce problems gradually, a few at a time), the dimensions of the data have not bccn limited in any way. 4. The knowledge organization. Although the body of knowledge with which we are dealing is at least partly based on intuition, on vague and not even coherent data (as lexicographic definitions often are), and on inductive empirical strategies, we must attempt to model the knowledge as the system acquires it. The formalism for the representation of word-senses is as follows. Each element is defined as a Function characterized by a Type and Arguments. The Type qualifies the function. The main types include: tlypernym, Relation, Qualifier, etc. Examples of the Type.Relation are: USED, PRODU('I~D, IN-TIIIM:OP, M, SI'IJI)Y, LACK, etc. The type llypernym can be instantiated by: !lyperriym proper, PART, SliT, etc. Arguments may be either Terms, or Terms plus Function, or Functions. A Term can be a Label, a Word, or a combination of these with the logical operators 'and/or'. A Word can be either a Word-form, or a Lemma plus Grammatical Information (e.g. INpl means plural Noun). The following definitions: Battcrio, s.m., microrganismo vcgetale unicellularc priw) di","clorofilla. Batteriologia, s.f., parte della microbioloNa che studia i battcri. are now represented as: Batterio --def-- > f(T. t tYP,IN Imicrorganismo,"]},{"title":"f(T.QUAL,lAlvegetale,","paragraphs":["]AlunicelMare), f(-I'.REL-I.,XCK,[ N[clorofilla))","Baltcliolo~a --def-- > f(T.IIYI'-PART, f(T.REL-SPEC,lNImicrobiologia), f(T.I~,I-I ,-ST U D,I Nplbanerio) ) . As the metalanguage and the rules are declared separately from the pattern-matching parser, the system is incremental, flexible, portable (it can be used with other languages or other dictionaries), and testable. In fact, the system has been designed so that it is easy to test alternative strategies or sets of rules or constraints. This kind of organization will allow us to draw inferences, using part of the formal structure associated to an entry and inserting it in other structures in which that entry appears as an Argument.

I'heretbre, after the first stage, the system consists of patterns augmented with conditioning rules which will then drive subsequent runnings of tile procedure ([br those cases which are lexically or grammatically conditioned). In this way, the system can be gradually retined.

At the end, from a comparison of the different formalized stuctures generated, we will be able to associate structures which differ for only one element (a conceptual category or relation). In this way, we can construct something like \"minimal pairs\" of sense-definitions, which only differ in one conceptual or relational feature. It can be reasonably supposed that this teature is related or realizes one of the differences between these words. It will also be possible to build hierarchies not only for hypcrnyms, but also, and more interestingly, for complex conceptual structures considered as a whole. ReferencEs It.
