Since, therefore, the only point at which the arcs are non-overlapping is between /ng/ and /w/, phoneme sequence constraints stlould apply to insert a word boundary at that point (there being no monomorphemic words in the English language that contain a medial /ng w/). At the same time, however, Figure 1 would seem to suggest that the prior\" implementation of phoneme sequence constraints is superfluous, since all word boundaries can he found frmn the chart-parsing strategy. However, the application of phoneme sequence constraints may enable recovery when the chart-parsing strategy is unable to parse the phonemic string because of the incorrect :derivation of a particular phoneme. Suppose, for example, that the acoustic-phonetic component incorrectly derives/el ng/from the parameteriscd acoustic wavetbrm instead of/i ng/(Figure 2)."]},{"title":"TEACH TEA TEE~~~oi 3 ng--3 w ] i jERROR: cannot be parsed","paragraphs":["Fig. 2: The incorrect substitution of"]},{"title":"~oil","paragraphs":["for /i/ makes the above sequence unparsable since /ch oi ng7 occurs neither word-internally nor across word boundaries. 225 In this case, a left-to-right chart-parsing strategy would break off at/ch/because/ch oi ng/is unparsable: there are no words that end in/ch el/or begin with/el rig/and/el/is not usually corrsidered to be a word (aside from an exclamation) in the English language. Since the strategy works from left-to-right, the phonemes which lie to the right of this error would also remain unparsed: thus will would not be derived frmn /w i 1/, unless the chart-parsing strategy were modified in some way to be able to cope with this kind of error. If, on the other hand, phoneme sequence constraints had been applied, a word boundary would have been inserted between/ng/and/w/. This would enable immediate recovery from the kind of error described above: in this case, if the chart-parsing strategy is unable to continue parsing phonemes at a particular point (from /ch/ to /el/ to /ng/) it can continue parsing from the following word boundary (between /ng/ and /w/) that trod been automatically inserted by phoneme sequence constraints. The prior application of phoneme sequence constraints, therefore, breaks up a single string of phonemes into smaller units, whicb, from the point of view of the left-to-right chart-parsing strategy, are independent of each other. A by-product of the prior insertion of word boundaries in this way is that the chart-parsing strategy could parse each of these units in parallel (Figure 3).

Such a parallel strategy may be computationally faster than one which parses the string strictly from left-to-right.","As in Harringt0n & Johnstone (1988), sentences transcribed by a trained phonetician are used as the input data. The experiment does not take account, therefore, of any errors which may arise as a result of inaccuracies in the automatic extraction of the phonemes from the acoustic signal by the phonetic rule component of a continuous speech recogniser. 2 Method I 2.1 Word boundary sequences","In order to identify phoneme sequences which are excluded word-internally (and which therefore signal the presence of a word boundary), it is necessary to determine a priori the complete set of three phoneme sequences which can occur across word boundaries. For this purpose, a 'Word-lexicon' of the 23,000 most frequent words (including many derivational and inflectional morphological variants and compounds) in part of the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus (Johannson, Leech & Goodluck, 1978} was used with each word keyed to one citation form and zero or more reduced form pronunciations. The citation form entry, which is often identical to the one given in Gimson (1984), corresponds to a phonemicisation of an isolated production of the word at a moderately slow tempo. The reduced forms include variant phonemieisations of the same words which might occur in faster speech productions. In general, three different kinds of reduction rules are included: alternation rules in which segments 226 are in free variation (e.g./co k sh @ n/,/o k sh @ rg, auction); deletion rules in which single segments may be deleted (/o k sh n/ from/o k sh @ n/, auction); and word-internal assimilation rules (/g u b b at/from/g u d b a~/, good-bye). The rules do not take into account phonological assimilation across word boundaries (see Harrington, Laver & Cutting (1986) for further details of the reduction rules). The reduced forms were derived from the citation forms by rule using a software package running on Xerox-ll00 workstations in Interlisp-D (Cutting & Harrington, 1986). After the application of the reduction rules on the 23,000 word lexicon, around 70,000 reduced forms were derived (on average, ttmrefore, each word is associated with 4 different pronunciations).","In order to derive the complete set of possible three phoneme sequences that occur across word boundaries, all final two phonemes (PP#) were paired with all initial phonemes (#P) of all citation and reduced forms, thus deriving the complete set of PP#P sequences (where P is any phoneme); and all final phouenms (P#) were paired with the first two phonemes (#PP) of all citation and reduced forms thus deriving the complete set of P#PP sequences. This pairing operation produced a total of 62,670 different three-phoneme sequences.","Subsequently, it was necessary to take into account some of the modifications to word boundary sequences which occur as a result of assimilatory processes since, as stated above, these were not included in the reduction rules. In order to take into account the realisation of/r/in phrases such as/dh e@ raa m e n i/ (there are many) and 'intrusive/rf (/dh ii aid i @ r i z/, the idea is), the sequences in (1) were paired with all word-initial vowel phonemes that occurred in the Word lexicon: (1) /U@ r, e@ r, i@ r, @ r, @@ r, oo r, aa r/ thus deriving, for example,/@ r# i/(measure is),/aa r # au/(far out) etc. In addition,/r/was paired with all #VP sequences in the Word-lexicon where V is any word-initial vowel and P is any phoneme. This pairing operation results in sequences such as/r # i z,J (measure is), /r # au t] (far\" out) etc.","In order to account for the assimilation of alveolars to bilabials preceding bilabials, all PPt # sequences (where P is any phoneme and Pt is one of /t,d,n/) were extracted from the Word-lexicon. Final/t],/d/,/n/were then changed to/p/,/b/and/m/ respectively (thus the PPt # sequences/it t #/,/it d #/,/it n #/were changed to/it p #/,/it b #/,/it m #f). The changed sequences were then paired with the labial consonants/p,b,m,f,v,w/. This pairing operation produces sequences such as/it p # b/(eat by),/on m # f/ (shown few),~@@ m # w~ (burn wood).","A similar procedure was used to take account of the instability of some of the alveolars before palatals and velars as shown in Table 1 below. /s/to/sh/: oo sh # sh sh # shuu (horse shoe) /zJ to/zh/: i zh # sh zh # sh u@ (is sat'el /t/to/ch/: a ch # y eh # y oo (at your) /d/to/jh/: ijh # y jh # y uu (didyou) It/to/k/: ai k # k k # k uh (might come) /dJ to/g/: iig # k g # k 1 (need cleaning) /n/to/ng/: e ng # k ng # k a (when can) Table I: Sonm of the word boundary assimilation cases considered in the derivation of word boundary sequences.

The results show that 523/1411 (37%) of the target word boundaries were correctly detected. However, there were 69 automatically inserted # boundaries which did not correspond to word boundaries in the original utterances. Of these, 14 were incorrectly inserted because of the presence of reduced phonological forms in the utterances (e.g./w @ dh] for with) which we had failed to generate by rule; and 7 were inserted because some words occurred in the utterances that had not been included in the Word-lexicon (most of these were proper names). 44 # boundaries were inserted at morpheme boundaries, both in compounds (/h au # e v @/for however) and preceding inflectional suffixes (/s i' m # z/ for seems). In the next section, some morphology rules ale described which attempt to convert the # at stem/suffix boundaries in cases such as/s i m # Z] into morpheme boundaries. Finally, 244 '?' were inserted at appropriate points (i.e. for each/P?QPJ, where/PQR/are phonemes, either/P#QP,/or /PQ#PJ occurred in the original utterances}. The next section also describes rules for converting some of these '?' boundaries into definite # boundaries. 4. Method II 4.1 Morphology rules","The phonemic strings with the word boundaries inserted by the matching algorithm in Figure 4 are input to a second stage of processing which uses four additional sources of knowledge: PHON1 and PHON2 (a list of all one and two phoneme words in the Morphology-lexicon) and #PP and PP# (a list of all legal word-initial and word-final two phoneme sequences). Since these data are extracted from the Morphology-lexicon, they take account of phonologically reduced variants, but not the morphological variants that were excluded from the Word-lexicon.","The morphology rules test whether the two phonemes that occur to the right of an automatically inserted # are legal with respect to PHON1, PHON2, #PP andPP#. If they are not, the assumption is made that the # occurs across a stem/inflectional morpheme boundary. Morphological rules are then applied to shift the # to the correct place, if possible. Consider for example, the phrase boys and girls in... which, after the application of the first i stage of processing, was analysed as: (2) boi#zan?g@@l#zin The insertion of the word boundaries at this first stage of processing is attributable to the fact that neither /b oi Z] nor /g..@@..1..z/ occurred in the Morphology-lexicon. Furthermore, since there are no words that begin with/el Z] nor/1 z/, the relevant sequences would be stored as/b oi # Z] and/@@ 1 # z/in the tree in Figure 4. The following test is now performed on the two phonemes to the right of the first # in (2):","(3) If/z a/is not in #PP rewrite/el # z a/as/el M z # a/ else rewrite/el # z a/as/el M? z a/."]},{"title":"228","paragraphs":["Informally, (3) states that if/z a/cannot begin words (according to the Morphology-lexicon),/z/must be an inflectional suffix of the previous word: therefore place an 'M' (morpheme boundary) before /Z] and shift the # symbol to the right of/z]. Alternatively, if/z a/ does begin words in the Morphology-lexicon, it is impossible to determine whether/z/is a plural suffix or the first phoneme of a following word. In this case, M? is used to denote these two possibilities: it is an abbreviation for either/el M z # M or /el # z a/. In fact, since there are no words that begin with /z a/, (2) is analysed as/M z # a]. A solution with M? would occur if boys are were analysed at the first stage of processing as: (4) b oi # z aa since in this case/Z] can also be the first phoneme of a word (Csar}.","A test is often performed with respect to PHON1 and/or PHON2 rather than #PP.

In order to resolve the hypothetical ambiguity /ABC?DEF/, for example, it is first expanded into the two possible cases it represents in (7) and (8) below: (7) ABC#DEF (8) ABCD#EF An attempt is then made to prove that either (7) or (8) is illegal (on the basis that, if (7) is illegal, ABC?DEF must correspond to the representation in (8) and vice-versa). (7) can be proved illegal if (9) is true:","(9) Either C is not in PHON1 and BC is not in PP# Or D is not in PHON1 and DE is not in #PP An informal interpretation of (9) is the following. If C is not a one-phoneme word, test whether BC is a legal two-phoneme sequence that can end words; if C is not a one-phoneme word and BC cannot end words, then (7) must be illegal. Otherwise, if (7) i cannot be shown to be illegal on the basis of the phonemes that precede #, the phonemes that follow # are considered. In this case if D is not a one-phoneme word and if\" DE cannot begin a word, (7) must be illegal. Otherwise, (7) cannot be shown to be illegal and so the following (similar} test is applied to (8):","(10) (8) is illegal if: Either D is not in PITON1 and CD is not in PP# Or E is not in PHON1 and EF is not in #PP.

These expand i~to 2 n alternatives. As in the example above, if 2 n - l alternatives can be proved illegal, all r~ '?' symbols can be converted to # symbols. 4.3 Order of rules","After: the application of the first stage of the word boundary in..~ertion rules, expansion rules apply in which each '?' symbol is e~panded into two alternatives. The morphology rules apply to each of these expanded alternatives and at all other points in the utterance at which their structural description is met. Only after ~;he morphology rules have applied can any of the alternates be eliminated. The morphology rules must apply before eliminating alternatives, othm'wise some altm'natives might be incorrectly eliminated. This can be illustrated with the example boys and girls which, after the first stage of processing, was analysed as/b oi # z a n ? g @@ 1 # z/. This expands into: (16) boi#z an#g@@l#z (17) boi#z an g#@@l#z If the elimination rules applied prior to morphological rules, both (16) and (17) would be eliminated, since /z a/is not in #PP (and (17) is illegal since/n g/is not in PP#). I~, on the other hand, the morphology rules apply first, (18) and (19) would be derived from (16) and (17) respectively: (18) boiMz #an#g@@lMz# (19) boi~'fz #an g#@@lMz# Only (19) would be eliminated, on the grounds that/n g/is not a legal two-phoneme sequence occurring word-flnally.","A further illustration of the interaction between the expansion rules, morphological rules and elimination of alternatives is shown in (20 - 33) below. After the first stage of processing, months tie (from a sentence in a gardening manual, 'after a few months, tie in more growth') was analysed as/m uh n th ? s t ? ai/. This expands to four alternatives: (20) m uh n th # s t # ai i n (21) muhnth#st ai#in (22) muhnth s#t#aiin (23) muhnth s#t ai#in Morphology rules are applied to the four alternatives: (24) muhnthMs#t#aiin (25) muhnthM?st ai#in (26) muhnth sMt#aiin (27) muhnth sM?t ai#in (25) and (27) are further expanded into tim two alternatives they represent.

But the segments that intervene between an M and # are ignored. The following test would therefore be made to test the legality of (29):","(34) (29) is illegal if: l,]ither /th/is not in PITON1 and/n th/is not in PP# Or /t ai/is not in P[ION2 It is possible to eliminate (28) since/t/is not in PIION1. (31), (32) and (33) can be eliminated since/th s/does not occur in PP# (final /th s/occurring only across a stem/inflectional suffix boundary). (29) and (30) remain, and are collapsed into one representation in (35) using the M? notation: (35) muhnthM?s t ai#in Tim analysis shows therefore that /in uh n th ? s t ? ai/ corresponds to either months tie in or month sty in. 5. Results II","The statistics on the automatically inserted # boundaries are shown in Table IV.

This is an increase of around 9% compared with the result obtained prior to the application of the rules described in the preceding section. 24 # boundaries were inserted at inappropriate points, either because of the presence of"]},{"title":"229","paragraphs":["because of the presence of reduced forms in the utterances that we had not derived by rule, or because of lexical items that had not been included in the word-lexicon. All 21 inserted # symbols that corresponded to morpheme boundaries were inserted medially in compounds (e.g. how#ever, there#fore), while all automatically inserted # symbols that had occurred at stem/inflectional suffix boundaries (/s..i..m..#..z/ for seems) were converted to M or M? symbols using the morphology rules described above.","An approximate measure of the probability of a word boundary being incorrectly inserted can be made as follows. Firstly, since it was our intention that the algorithm should insert # symbols not only between words but also within compounds, the target number of boundaries to be identified can be considered to be 1411 (the number of word boundaries in the utterances) plus 78 (the number of boundaries occurring within compounds), i'.e. 1489. Of these (see Table IV), 645 + 21 = 666 (44.7%) were correctly inserted. The probability of a word boundary being incorrectly inserted, either as a result of a reduced form which was not derived by rule, or because of the omission of a word from the Word-lexicon, is given by: (36) (24/(666 ~}- 24) x 100) % 6. Discussion --- 3.5%.","This study has shown that around 45% of all word boundaries can be correctly identified from a knowledge of three-phoneme sequences that occur across word boundaries but which do not occur word-internally together with a knowledge of one- and two-phoneme words and all two-phoneme sequences that can begin and end words. The result is based on hand-transcriptions which can be considered analogous to the phonemic strings that would be extracted automatically from the acoustic speech signal if the recogniser made no errors in this derivation.","A current area of investigation is to identify the set of phoneme sequences which occur neither\" across a word boundary nor word-internally. Such phoneme sequences can be easily obtained from the data sets discussed in this paper and they would enable errors to be detected in the acoustic-phonetic stage of processing in a continuous speech recogniser. Some examples of these sequences are given in (37): (37) /1 z ng/,/aa dh l/,/e w n/ For example, /e w n/ must be illegal since it does not occur word-internally and because it does not occur across word boundaries (both/e # w rd and/e w # n/must be ruled out on the grounds that there are no words which end in/e/or/e w/). The incorporation of this kind of knowledge would enable an error to be detected ff such a sequence were derived automatically after the acoustic-phonetic stage of processing. 7.
