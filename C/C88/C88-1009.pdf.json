Box 80 08 80 7000 Stuttgart 80, West Germany (electronic mail on EARN/BITNET:","BEIERLE at DS#LILOG, PLETAT at DS#LILOG) Abstract: Feature graphs appearing in unification--based grammar formalisms and algebraic specifications of abstract data types (ADTs) are both used for defining a collection of objects together with functions between these object sets. Starting from this observation we define an algebraic semantics for feature graphs by assigning an algebraic specification to each feature graph. This opens the rich world of semantical foundations for abstract data types to the area of feature graphs and thus to unification grammar formalisms. Using results from ADT theory we define a sim~le and fast syntactic decision procedure testing the usual consistency conditions on feature graphs like constant consistency, constant/complex consistency and acyclicity on the algebraic specification assigned to a feature graph. With this machinery at hand feature graph unification becomes union of feature graph specifications followed by the consistency test."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Unification-based grammar formalisms have become a popular field o'f research. The subject has attracted the interest not only of (computer) linguists but also of computer scientists, especially in the area of logic programming, see e.g. [Pe 87]. Due to the formality of grammars we also observe activities developing foundations for the formal semantics of various approaches on unification grammars, e.g. [PS 84], [KR 86], [RK 86], [Pe 87], [Jo 87]. In this paper we investigate the relationship between feature graphs on the one hand and algebraic specifications of abstract data types (ADTs) on the other hand. There is a natural correlation between both these areas since a feature graph as well as an abstract data type defines a collection of objects together with functions relating the objects. We present a formal semantics for feature graphs by assigning to each feature graph G an equational ADT specification ~(G), called fg--specification. This opens the rich world of ma'thematical foundations of ADT specifications (e.g [GTW 78], [EM 85]) in order to obtain a better - not only - formal understanding of the nature of feature graphs. In particular, we provide a model-theoretic characterization of various consistency conditions for feature graph specifications reflecting the consistency concepts usually imposed on feature graphs such as clash-freeness and acyclicity. These 40 model-theoretic characterizations have proof-theoretic counterparts in terms of syntactic conditions on the deductive closure of the set of equations of r(G)o Although the proof-theoretic consistency characterizations are of syntactic nature, a test of their validity requires to examine the deductive closure of the set of equations of a fg-specification. Our objective is to restrict consistency checks to equations explicitly mentioned in a fg-specificationo In the ADT-world there is a well-known tool for such tasks: the Knuth-Bendix algorithm ([KB 70]). We present a Knuth-Bendix like completion procedure transforming any fg-specification into a reduced normal form. We show that the model-theoretic consistency characterizations for G are equivalent to the presence resp. absence of certain types of equations in this reduced normal form. These results are used for defining the semantics of the unification of two feature graphs GI and G2 as the (set-theoretic componentwise) union of ~(GI) and x(G2 ) followed by the normalization process using the completion algorithm and the consistency check on the resulting set of equations°"]},{"title":"2. Featuregraphs","paragraphs":["A feature graph is a directed graph with a distinguished root node. The edges of the graph are called features.

In fact, such a distinction has been omitted to a large extent in the literature. The situation changed with approaches that formalize the concepts of feature graphs since such a distinction is essential for a formal treatment (see e.g. [KR 86], [Jo 87]). In the area of ADT specifications the strict separation of the syntactic and the semantic level has ulways beet* a central aspect. Our ADT-.based approach to feature graphs adopts this two-level view in a natural way: Feature graph specifications are the syntactical means to describe feature graphs which are the models (or structures) of such specifications."]},{"title":"3._Equational Specifications 3oi ADT Specifications: Syntax and Semantics","paragraphs":["We introduce the basic notions of abstract data type specifications.

Besides these syntactical concepts of ADT specifications we provide the basic semantical concepts of heterogenous algebras: Given a signature ~ = <S, O>, a ~-algebra A consists of a family of sets A = < A, > .... and for each operator op e O .... there is a function opA : A, ---> A~ . A satisfies an equation 1 = r if for each assignment of values from A to the variables of 1 and r the evaluation of 1 and r in A yields the same element of A. A is a <Z,E>-algebra if A satisfies every e ~ E. We say that E semantically implies an equation e if every <~,E>-algebra satisfies e. It is well-known that this model-theoretic notion of satisfaction coincides with the proof-theoretic notion of deduction (Birkhoff theorem) where e can be proved from E iff e can be deduced from E using the rules of the equational calculus (e.g. [EM 85]). We let E e denote the deductive closure of E. The following theorem is one of the central results of ADT theory and forms the basis fo]:\" defining the semantics of a specification.","Theorem: For each algebraic specification SP = <~, E> there is an initial algebra Tsp satisfying the equations in E.

However, in equational ADT specifications it is essential to state explicitly to which objects an equation can be applied. For simplicitly, we first assume that we have only one sort which we call \"universe\", and that we have a variable x of sort \"universe'. By using a functional notation for the attributes and thus the reverse order of the attributes as compared to e.g. [PS 84], we would arrive at the specification sorts universe functions a: -> universe","f,g,h: universe -> universe equations g(f(x)) = h(x)","g(x) ="]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["However, by simply introducing a universally quantified variable x of sort \"universe\" we run into problems: From I, g(f(x)) = h(x) 2. g(x) = a","we can deduce h(x) ="]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["by using the usual rules of the equational calculus and substituting f(x) for x in equation (2). The problem is that x should be quantified only over all objects described by the original feature graph. But f(x) is not neccessarily in this set, so we must find a way of avoiding such a substitution. A simple way of achieving this is to switch to another signature with an additional sort, say \"soi', denoting the \"sort of interest\" and comprising all objects described by a feature graph. The sort \"sol\" is then a subsort of sort \"universe'. This could be expressed by extending the algebraic specifications to include also subsort relationships, thus moving from many-sorted specifications (as described in Section 3.1) to so-called order-sorted specifications (e.g. [GM 87]). Here, we want to stick to the simpler case of many-sorted specifications. A subsort relationship in a many-sorted setting is expressed by an inclusion function 42 which we will. denote by","i: soi -> universe in our case. In order to avoid problems with empty sorts ([GM 87], [EM 85]) we assume that there is a constant \"const\" of sort \"sol'.

Another approach bringing together initial ADT spec, i fications and feature graphs is given ill [SA 87]. ~t uses an order-sorted approach:, where the set of atoms and features must be fixed in advance, and where every element of a supersort must be in one of its subsorts Compared to the order- sorte%l approach of [SA 87] a drawback of the work presented here is the asymetric treatment of the tool; of a feature graph (giving rise to the \"se,i\" sort) and the other nodes (being mapped t;o thE; \"universe\" sort ) .
