S~dt case may be taken as an existence of ambiguity.","A primitive potential function is defined for each spatial relation. A potential function for overall situation is constructed by adding primitive potential functions for spatial relations in-volved.","When a potential function is formulated from a given set of information, the system will seek iora combination of arguments which may minhnize the value of potential function. We use a gTadual approximation method to obtain an approximate solution. Starting from an appropriate combination of arguments, the system changes the current set of values by a small amount proportional to a virtual force obtained by differentiating the potential function. This process will be repeated until the magnitude of virtual fo:cce becomes less than a certain threshold. Figure 1 illustrates those idea.","Unfortunately, using the gradual approximation ,nay not find a combination which makes a given potential function minimum. When there are some locally minimal solutions, this method will terminate with a combination appropriately near one of them. Which nfinimal nohtion is chosen depends on the initial set of argmnents.

By dependency we mean a partial order according to which position of objects are determined. SPRINT is designed so that it can take advantage of it. Instead of computing everything at once, the spatial reasoner can determine the position of objects one by one. An object whose position does not depend on any other objects is chosen as the origin of local coordinate. SPRINT determines the temporary position of objects from the root of the dependency network. The position of an object will be determined if the position of all of its predecessors is determined. -Figure 6 shows how SPRINT does this.","This algorithm has three problems: 1. the total plausibility may no~ be maximal.","2. in the worst case, the above may result in contradiction. 3. objects may be underconstrained.

Suppose also that a new inhibited region (interval I in a one dimensional world) is given as a new constraint. Then the position of the object is recomputed so as to take this new constraint into account. If the interval I accidentally in-volves x0, then the object may be moved out of interval I. This is the situation in which the object tends to move to the position x0 but cannot due to the inhibited half space. In this case, the parent node in the dependency is tried to move in the reverse direction to resolve this situation.","A situation is worse than the above ff the inhibited region (or interval) is too wide to fit in a space. This problem rises especially when we 768 take size into account. Suppose the position of two objects A and B are already given maximally plausible positions x0 and xl(xo < xl), respectively. Suppose now the third object C with width being wider than Xl -x0 is declared to exist between A and B. This causes a failure because there is no space to place C.","The solution to this problem comprises in two stages. First, the reason of the failure is analyzed. Then, parents of the current objects are moved gradually so that the inconsistency can be removed.
