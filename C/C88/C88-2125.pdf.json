As a consequence, an intermediate reprcsenlation is usually devised as a structure in which this common meaning is made explicit. The intermediate representation is scan as a semantic equivalcnl of the source text. For obtaining such a slrucmre, a syntactic analysis of the source text is by no mean:, superfluous. An inlennediate representatim~ consists, like any system, of elements and their relations. In a semantic system elc menls and relations ine semantic. But ill order to detect the elements and their relations in a given text, a syniactic maalysis is needed. (\"Syntax-fi'ee semantic parsers\" a, pply syntactic knowledge lacitly, and as a nile they work especially well for languages where the sequential mdet of \"purely st: mantle\" elements carries symactic thlbrmation.) There are two major clusters of reasons why an ideal ~;cmantic intermediate representation of the language.independent lend sketched above is impossible, however desirable it may be i>_ theory. Filet of 'all, tram are rm languagedndependeut sernanlic ale. manN. Whatever symbols am chosen --words, moiplmmes, numbers, letter codes... -- they are ,always inherently I.mgtmge-bnund. The elements of an artificial synthol system are either directly taken from an existthg language, or have aa explicit m implicit definition in a rcli.',rcnce hmguage. It is ira. possible to make a tufty language-independent system of sym. bols, if it is to possess the fill expressiveness of a hmnan language (ef. Schnbell 1986). Symbols cannot be giveu a meaning independenlly of a reference hmguage; I[leir meaning can only become autonomous by being used th a language community during a long period. This is why a plamle(t language like Esperanto could not rank as a lhll.-fledged hn. nmn language fimn the very day the first textbook was pub. lished but had to develop slowly from ml artificial, refercnce language-dependent symbol system into m~ autotiomous hmguage by being used in a community (cf. Sehnbeit fotthc.). Perhaps this is an tmusuN argument in a eomtmtalkmal con. text, where people are u~d to defining symbol systems which they call \"languages\". It shoukl be borne in mind, however, that such defined symlx)l systems am subsets of an existing human language (or o1' several). Machine translation, by con trast, is concerned with translatin G texts between thunau languages, which hem a sem,'mtic point of view -- even if die lmlguage may be simplified or the text pre-edited-- are in-hermNy more complicated than artificial symbol systems. Not only are deft)ted semantic units in such systems reference hmguage-dependent, but the mad to the basic semantic units needed is via semantic deeompositim~ - with all its we11-599 known problems. Scholars have for centuries been trying to find universally valid semantic atoms (or primitives), but none of the many systems suggested has met with acknowledgement or proved applicable on any wider scale. Individual languages cut up and label reality in different ways; no underlying \"smallest semantic units\" have been found as yet and possibly they will never be found. In my opinion the conclusion is that meaning is not portioned, so that no smallest portions can be found. Semantic atoms would be needed for totally spelling out the content of a text in a language-independent way, that is, in such a way that it would be suited for translation into any arbitrary target language. In many machine translation systems, ambitions are not that high. Most often, intermediate representations use words or other language-bound symbols, decorated with semantic features which are held to be cross-linguistically valid. Yet, what is true for semantic atoms applies to semantic features as well, albeit in a less obvious way: They contain portions of meaning which do not function in all languages in the same way. That semantic atoms and features are not as cross-linguistic as they seem to be, is also suggested by the experience that they are very hard to define and delimit in a way that fulfils exactly the required function, or denotes precisely the intended distinction for a large number of languages simultaneously. It is because of this that intermediate representations often have to be adapted, attuned or even redesigned when a new source or target language is added to the system. Such representations fail to provide for multilingual extensibility. 3. Case frames The second cluster of reasons for the impossibility of an ideal, purely semantic, intermediate representation concerns semantic relations. One of the best-known approaches to making semantic relations explicit is Fillmore's ease grammar (1968). Deep cases are often believed to be cross-linguistically valid. Although there are many substantial difficulties in delimiting and labelling deep cases (cf. Fillmore 1987), many machine translation systems perform transfer with case frames. This works quite well to a certain degree, but slowly the insight is gaining ground that deep cases nevertheless are language-specific. If case frames really were an autonomous"]},{"title":"tertium comparationis,","paragraphs":["translating on the basis of case frames would mean just filling in target language forms in a language-independent case frame obtained from the source language analysis. But in reality case frame-based translation often entails a transfer from a source language-specific case frame to a target language one. Evidence for this need comes first from general linguistics (e.g. Pleines 1978: 372; Engel 1980: 11), but recently alms up in computational linguistics as well (Tsujii 1986:. 656; cf. Schubert 1987a). This is in concord with Harold Somers' (1987: viii) observation about the popularity of case grammar, already declining in theoretical linguistics, but still in vogue in computational applications. Returning to the argument about a purely semantic system, it can be concluded that neither the elements nor the relations, which together should constitute the theoretically desirable language-independent intermediate representation, actually exist. This insight, among others, is the origin of the idea of implicitness in machine translation."]},{"title":"4. Implicitness","paragraphs":["Since there are no cross-linguistically valid semantic relations, and since case frames arc therefore language-specific, the transfer step actually lacks a language-independent intermediate stage. This means that, where semantic relations are concerned, there is no tree pivot. There are only source structures and target structures with a transfer step somewhere between them. Given the notorious difficulties of defining deep cases, 600 the question arises whether it is really necessary for machine translation to make semantic relations explicit. As they are language-specific anyway, it is much easier to perform transfer at another level, which is language-specific as well, but about which there is much more certainty: syntax. If transfer is carded out at the syntactic level, semantic deep cases can remain implicit. Before describing this in somewhat more detail, a few words about the semantic elements. If there are no language-independent semantic relations, looking for language-independent semantic elements does not seem worthwhile either. Yet, the above discussion of the function of an intermediate representation entails another unexpected implication: Since an intermediate representation is the only link between source and target languages, it must be as expressive as any of them. If high-quality machine translation is the goal, this condition is inevitable, since the intermediate representation has to render and to convey the full and unsimplified content of the text, to make further translation possible. It must be feasible to translate into such an intermediate representation from all other languages. Interestingly enough, this translatability criterion is the property by which human language is distinguished from artificial symbol systems by one of the classics of linguistics, Louis Hjelmslev (1963: 101). According to him, a human language (his term is"]},{"title":"dagligsprog)","paragraphs":["is a language into which all other communication systems (human languages and artificial symbol systems) can be translated. As a consequence of Hjelmslev's theory, an intermediate representation with the expressiveness indispensable for multilingual high-quality machine translation should indeed be it-self a human language. Now the elements and relations in the semantic system of the intermediate representation can be considered together. The discussion so far has yielded two results: There are no language-independent semantic elements and there are no cross-linguistically valid semantic relations. Moreover, the required expressiveness entails the consequence that the intermediate representation should be a full-fledged language. If the pivot of a machine translation system is a language (rather than an artificial symbol system), this removes the problems of spelling out semantic dements and relations. Semantics can then be kept implicit, that is, it can be expressed in tile intermediate language by purely linguistics means, in the way illustrated below. If the intermediate language is a full language, the syntactic side of the translation process comes down to performing two direct translations: first from a source language into the intermediate language, and then from the intermediate into a target language. Moreover, if one opts for a human intermediate language, this brings about a substantial change in the design of a pivot-based mnltilingual machine translation system. Artificial intermediate representations are designed to achieve multilingual extensthillty at the level of transfer. The conditions that provide for extensibility are thus directly intertwined with the mechanisms that translate from one particular language into another. But when the intermediate representation is a language, multilingual extensibility shifts to another level: it is now catered for by the combination of language pair modules in which the intermediate language is always one of the two counterparts. This considerably facilitates the design, since mullllingual extensibility with all its needs of cross-linguistically valid grammatical elements and relations no longer interferes with the translation steps proper. For this type of direct translation within a language pair, a translation method that performs the syntactic transfer on the basis of"]},{"title":"syntactic functions","paragraphs":["is both suitable and sufficient. A possible implementation of this idea is found in the metataxis translation method (Schubert 1987b: 222ff.). It works on the basis of language-specific syntactic functions and contrastive transformation ntles that cater for the transfer step. Metataxis mle,~; can be seen as contrastive lexical redundancy rules ore1' a bilingual dictionary. Teehulcally speaking, they are tree tt~msduction rules which presuppose the dictionary to consist of tree-structured entries. Metataxis is contrastive dependency syntax for translation. Of course it is not the only possible way of performing the syntactic part of a machine translation procedure. A dependency-based approach, however, is esprit[ally well suited for a multilinguul system, since dependency syntax takes syntactic functions as its primary units, using syntactic form as a secondary means. This is an essential enhancement, since syntactic functions- i.e. dependency retation.s such as subject, object etc. - are translation-relevant, whereas syntactic form characteristics- such as a word's Position vis-~t-vis other words, its endings for case, number, lerson, tense, mood, aspect etc.- are needed for monolingual analysis and synthesis steps in an overall translation proo'.ss, but are not themselves directly translation-relevant). As for th¢~ semantic side of the translation process, an intermediate representation tempts its designers to make explicit all the semantic distinctionsneeded for specific source and target languages, which ultimately leads astray if mnltilingual extensibility is aimed at. This is the danger of an \"exploding\" pivot. If the pivot is a language, the degree of semantic detail it provides can be taken as a natural limitation to this explosive tern dency: An implementation is possible in which the entire semantic pn~cessing needed for a machine translation procedure is carried out with linguistic means in the intermediate language only. This means that whatever semantic elements or relations are used, they are always expressed by means of words aria morphemes from the intermediate language. No semantic ll;atures, no selection rules and no meta-linguistic labels or togs are used. This is in good agreement with the metataxis approach to the syntactic side of the process: Metataxis provides all syntactically possible translations of a source sentence (clause, paragraph ._) and the semantic processing performs a choice among these Alternatives. (It normally needs a substanlial pragmatic augmentation witli knowledge of the world etc; ef. Papegaaij/Sehubert forthc.: chapter 3.5.). This semantic process can be carried out entirely in the intermediate language and is titus suitable for metataxis altemative translations generated from whatever source language. The second half of the translation, from the intermediate into a target lauguage, could in theory work in the same way, but this would presuppose semantic processing in all the different target lanl,,uages. The requirement of extensibility is much better met, if all the semantic processing for the second half as well is carried out by means of the intermediate language. This is indeed possible. The semantic-pragmatic processing in the second half is - to put it in plain words - conceroed with fitting in the alternative translations offered in the bilingual dictionary (intermediate language ---> target language) into the context of the sentence and the entire text. What is needed for assessing the probability of different contexts is information about the typical contexts of the words in question: word expert knowledge. It is possible to describe the typical contexts of target language words by means of words and phrases in the intermediate language. Thus all semantic-pragmatic comparisons and probability computations are carried out exclusively in the intermediate language, and as a consequence only a single semantic system is needed for trattslating between arbitrary languages: a system in the intermediate language, ff rids central system is built up within the limitations of fl~e intermediate language without reference to any peculiarities of p .a.rtieular source and target languages, the requirement of complete extensibility is fulfilled. 5. Conch~slon An inte.uediate language for high-quality machine translation needs to he a full-fledged human language, due to the inherent lack of expressiveness that is an inevitable characteristic of artificial symbol systems. 1 argue that one can make a virtue of this necessity: A human language as intermediate representation allows for rendering the full content of the text without making semantic elements and relations more explicit than what is expressed by appropriately interrelated words of the intermediate language. Of course the question arises whether, in that ease, any arbitrary language would be suited for this function. It should be pointed out, however, that the full range of trade-offs related to the choice of an intermediate language cannot be dealt with in this three-page contribution. My ideas about implicitness are closely related to one of at least three fundamental criteria for an intermediate language: expressiveness. The other two are regularity and semantic autonomy. Only when all criteria are considered together, can a choice be made. References","Engel, Ulrich (1980): Fiigungspotenz and Sprachvergleich.
