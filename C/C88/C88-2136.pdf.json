Before explaining BUP--XG, we will briefly explain the mechanism of the BUP system, the predecessor of BUP-XG. Basic parsing mechanism of BUP is left-corner parsing with top-down prediction. 2.1 BUP system ]in BUP system, grammar rifles written in DCG (Figure 2) are translated into the rules called BUP clauses which are also of DCG format and some Prolog program (link clauses and termination clauses : explained .later).","Figure 3 shows results of the translation. These BUP clauses are then translated into a Prolog program (Figure 4) by the DCG translator wl,ich is embedded in the Prolog system. Two more arguments are added to each predicate which denotes nontenninal symbol in figure 4. These arguments constitutes a difference list which represents the input string. With the special predicate goal which is necessary for bottom up parsing, this Prolog program can parse the input string with a bottom-up and depth-first strategy. Figure 5 shows the definition of the predicate goal.","Now, we shall give a step by step explanation of the parsing algorithm of the BUP system. We will use the grammar shown in figure 4 and input sentence \"you walk\" as an example. Calling the predicate goal activates the parsing process: ?- goal(s, [you,walk] ,[]). np(G,X,Z) :~' link(rip,G), (p--l) goal (vp ,X ,Y), s(G,Y,Z). pron(~,X,Y) :- np(G,X,Y). (p-2) diet (pron, [youlX] ,X) .","(p-S) dict (vp, [wa].k IX] ,X) o","(p-4) Figure ~: Prolog progn~.ms translated from figure 3 goal(G,X,Y) :-~ (g-l) (wf_goal(G,X,_) fail_goal(G,X), ! ,fail ),!, wf_goal(G,X,Y).","goal(G,X,Y) :- (g-2) diet (C,X,Y), link(C,G) , P =.. [c,G,Y,Z], call (P), assertz (wf_goal (P)).","goal(G,X,Y) :- (g-3) assertz(fail_goal(G,X)) , !, fail. Figure 5: Definition of the goal clause This calling checks to see if : A parse tree the root of which is the category %', can be constructed from the input string denoted by the difference between the list [you, walk] and the list [ ] ([you, walk] in this example). The first call of goal invokes the clause (g-l) in the figure 5. The clause (g-l) checks to see if the same analysis have been made before, to avoid recomputation using the information previously asserted as wf_goal and fail_goal.","As the execution of the clause (g-l) fails in this case, the system chooses the next clause (g-2). In the body of the clause (g-2), the system consults the dictionary by calling \"diet (C, [you, walk], Y) \". This predicate call picks (p-3) in figure 4 and the system matches \"pron\" with variable C and \"[walk]\" with variable Y.","In the second line of (g-2), the system calls the predicate link to see if the category which is obtained by the previous dictionary consultation (\"pron\" in this example) can be left-corner of the current goal ('%\" in this example). The llnk clauses are calculated by the BUP translator. Suppose this test succeeds, the system calls the predicate \"pron\" : P =.. [pron,s,[walk],[]], call(P). Calling \"pron(s, [walk] , [] )\" invokes (p-2). Then, the system executes its body that is, \"up (s, [walk] , [] )'~. Calling \"np(s, [walk], [] )\" invokes the clause (p-l). After calling the predicate llnk to check a teachability from"]},{"title":"\"np\"","paragraphs":["to \"s\", the system invokes \"goal (vp, [walk], [] ) \". At this point, the system has analyzed the string \"you\" as \"up\" and is predicting that the trailing string \"walk\" should be bundled up to the category \"vp\".","In the same manner, a bottomoup analysis with a top-down prediction proceeds until the execution of goal with the termination clauses succeeds. See [14] for the detail of the termination clauses.","R,esults once succeeded or failed in an analysis are asserted as wf_goal in the end of (g-2) and fail_goal in the clause (g-'S) respectively.

Efficient trace searching is possible as the system as-sumes the e:dstence of traces only when a particular catego,y is predicted as a goal.","A pu~e boa;tom-up parser is not capable of such predictions and inefficiency results because of the necessity to assume the existence; of a trace between every two words. However, since the BI[P system incorporates top-down prediction in the bottom-up parsing strategy described in 2.1, it is possible to implement the mechanism to look for the traces efficiently. Konno developed a BUP--XG system which in-corporated such a mechanism [5].","The XGS adopted in LangLAB p~ovides grammar writers the facility ~¢ith which left extraposition tan be naturMly expressed in grammar rules. Figure 6 shows a small English grammar w]dch is written in XGS.","The notation \". o/\" (called \"slash\") in the rule (x=3) is introduced in XGS. This rule means that there exists the syntactic category \"up\" which dominates the \"trace\" under the syptactic ca~egory \"s=xel\" (%.xel\" means relative sentence). This idea is influenced by the %lash category\" in GPSG [3]. We call the category after \"../\" ~c slash category\". Rule (x-3) also shows that the category '~np '~ consists of the categories \"det\", ~'noun\" and %.xel\" and that the trace left behind by the left extraposition of the norm phrase consisting of \"det\" a~td \"norm\" is dominated by \"s~rel\". During an ~nalysi% when the system finds the trace under \"s_~el\", as sl~own tit figure 7, its associates the trace in the enlbedded sentence with the moved phrase (\"the man\").","XGS also provides a notation to represent \"Ross's Como plex NP constraint\" [10].

(x-.3') With (x-3 ' ), the trace which is dominated by slash category \"up\" under \"s_rel\" can only correspond to the noun phrase which consists of \"det\" and \"noun\".","In addition, XGS also provides a double arrow notation (==>) and the notation to describe X lists (explained later) explicitly. With these notation, \"coordinate structure\" can be represented in a natural way (see [5]). 2.3 BUP-XG translator Just like the BUP system, the grammar rules written in XGS are translated into BUP-XG clauses, link clauses atLd termination clauses by the BUP-XG translator. The BUP-XG translator in the LangLAB system has been improved so as to generate BUP--XG clauses more optimized than that in the original BUP-XG system. Furthermore, it is also equipped with a new function which inserts parse tree in.- formation automatically. The translator takes about three seconds to translate a grammar of about 200 rules. The following subsection explains these inlprovements. 2.3.1 Representation ofllnk clauses As the number of grammar rules increases, more link clauses are generated by the translator. For example, from about 200 grammar rules of English which we have developed, the BUP-XG translator generates about 700 llnk clauses. Shortening the search time of llnk clauses wonld contribute to an efficient analysis.","Link clauses are called in the body of BUP-XG clauses and in the predicate goal. Since both the alguments of link are atoms in the both cases, a llnk link (a, b). which denotes th.e reachablity from the category %t\" to \"b\" can be change to the form a(b) :- !. This form of representation reduces the search space of the reachablity test. The BUP-XG translator in LangLAB geuo erates link information of this form. 557 2.3.2 Indexes for ditFerenee ]:~st As described in subsection 2.1 input string are represented by ~, difference list and intermediate analysis results are as-- served with the predicate wfgoal a:ud fidl.goal. Since dm h~st two arguments of\" the wf_goal constitutes a diffbrence list of the input string, the longer the input string becomes, ~he more memory wKgoe! consumes. By indexing differ.. once lisfs, the amonnt of memory ~:eqnired is reduced, amt faster re[create to intermediate results is possible.","}'or example, when the system gets the input string '!you walk\", the predicates text arc a.sse~ted as follows : tex~(sO, []). text (r~:l:, [~alk]) . te:~:t(s2, [you, ~al.k])° 'l'he dictionary reference program gets a difference list by calling text with indexes (s],s2,...) as the key, before consuiting the dietiom~ry. 2.:L3 Representation of intermediate results Generally, a long input string gives rise to more wftgoals and faiLgoals which results in longer search time for intermediate analysis results. Wf_goals and fail_goals have as their arguments, the index to the difference list denoting the partial input string, and its anMysis. As described in 2.1; goal first consults wf goads and fail_geMs with the indexes of input string as the key. In LangLAB system, the predi- (:ate names of intennedlate analysis result are the indexes to the ditference list insteaA of \"wLgoa.]\" or \"fail_goal'. This modification reduces the search space oil the intermedi~ttc analysis results and speeds up the analysis processo 2.3°4 Insertion of parse tree information Users sometimes reqaire the results of syntactic analysis to be expressed as pa.rse trees, and in both the BUP system and the originM B(Y])--XG system, users are required to insert an argument in each category to accommodate parse tree lure> marion. Itoweve~, it is not a difficult task to make the translator insert this information automatically, ht the BUP-XG translator of LangLAB, this information is inserted automaritally unless instructed otherwise. This Nnction is similar to ~he one in the McCord's MLG(Modular Logic Grammar) [7]. However, unlike MLG, all the nonterminal symbols can be a node of parse trees. 2.3.5 Example of translation Figure 8 shows the BUP--XG clauses translated t~om the grammar in figure 6. The wriables beginning with \"X\" in the figme.8 axe introduced to handle left extraposmon. Tins variable is called X list (extraposition list) which were introduced in XG [8]. Information pertaining to slash categories is pushed into the X llst and is then transfe:rred from eate.~ gory to category during the analysis process.

The optimization is less effective in the compiled mode than in the interpretive mode. I[owever, this optimization is practical because debugging is usually done in the interpretive mode. We believe that LangLAB has the capacity for practical use.","']'here is a related work SAX [6] by Matsumoto. SAX is also a parsing system based on logic programming, but its parsing strategy is bottom-up and breadth-first. Okunishi of ICOT reports that LangLAB is 6 ~ d0 times faster than SAX in the intm'pretive mode. However, in the compiled mode, SAX is 6 ~- 16 times faster than LangLAB [11]. SAX has still yet to be modified to handle idioms. If this modification is introduced, debugging can be done on LangLAB in the interpretive mode and the debugged grammar can be executed on SAX in the compiled mode. 5 C \" oonchlmon We have made the following modification to the original BUI)-XG : 660 • Optimized and enhanced translated code • Adopted TItIE structured dictionary With these modifications, the analysis sped up in comparison to the original BUP-XG system and fiexible idiom handling became possible. We believe that LangLAB has become a more powerful and practical tool for natural language processing. We plan to develop a natural language processing system which includes semantic analysis, based on LangLAB. References","[1] A. V. Aho, J. E. Hopcroft, and J. D. Ulhnan.
