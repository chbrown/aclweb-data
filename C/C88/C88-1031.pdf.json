Our stylistic grammar is a branching stratificational model, built upon a foundation dealing with lexical, syntactic, and semantic stylistic realizations. Its central level uses a vocabulary of constituent stylistic elements common to both English and French, while the top level correlates stylistic goals, such as clarity and concreteness, with patterns of these elements. Overall, we are implementing a computational schema of stylistics in French-to-English translation. We believe that the incorporation of stylistic analysis into machine translation systems will significantly reduce the current reliance on human post-editing and improve the quality of the systems' output."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Current machine translation (MT) systems deal only superficially, if at all, with the translation of style.

For MT, where we expect to deal with large amounts of similar types of text, the analysis of group style is of more interest than the idiosyncratic style of any one writer.

Functional group styles, on the other hand, are correlated with particular types of situations and are a more realistic objective.","To fulfill both of the complementary aims, we require a view of style that is goal-directed. A recent example with this view of stylistics is the PAULINE system described in Hovy [1987]. PAULINE generates text that conforms to given pragmatic and stylistic constraints; the system is goal-directed, able to correlate such stylistic goals as for-mallty, simplicity, and respect with the characteristics of the text produced.","In French-to-English translation, as an example, we must account for the fact that French is generally more abstract, static, and precise while English tends to be concrete, dynamic, and more lenient towards vagueness (Vinay and Darbelnet [1958]). For the same text, therefore, the French source language may express an abstract style while the English target language must be more c~ncrete i n its lexical and syntactic choices. If we are to properly translate from French style to English stylel then we mus~ understand how syntactic structures and' lextcal choices correlate with particular stylistic goals or aspects, such as abstraction, concreteness, statieness, and' dynamism. 148"]},{"title":"3 A Computational Schema of Stylistics in Translation","paragraphs":["We haw; restricted our interest in style for MT purposes to concerns ~hat are pragmatic, group-based, and goal-directed.

Why not just edit the output of a MT system to remove awkward syntax and achieve a more natural flow of words? The answer is that to preserve the author's stylistic intent, while meeting the stylistic demands of the target l~aguage, we must determine the author's specific stylistic goals and consider how these different aspects can be realized syntactically and lexically in the tin'get language. Thus, we must analyse the original source text to make certain we understand the source language style before trying to translate.","To implement the computational schema of stylistics in translation shown in Figure 1, knowledge about stylistics must be ~,.ccumulated, created, and organized into a formal","representation.

But what, in syntactic terms, gives each component a particular stylistic effect? How should we define \"stylistic shape\" at the syntactic level?","We have adapted Quirk and Greenbamn's [1979] use of syntactic integration as the basis for our definition of syntactic stylistic shape. They catalogue most adverbials, some prepositional phrases, and some clauses as either adjunct, conjunct, or disjunct deI)ending on tile degree of inherent integration. We have chosen to base the syntactic stylistic effect of all sentence components on their charac-- teristic integration. We have therefore expanded the catalogue to define a syntactic stylistic vocabulary classifying components as either adjunct (strongly integrating), conjunct (less integrating, but still having a connective effect), disjunct (neutral), or \"antijunct\" (having a disconnective effect).","We then adopted Crystal and Davy's [1969] \"stylistic\" grammar as the foundation for our syntactic stylistic grammar. Their grammar is built upon a vocabulary of stylistically significant syntactic components. It also recognizes the role of pre- and post-modification in stylistic effects, a feature we have expanded in our grammar, a po> tion of which is shown in Table 3.","Now, having a base syntactic stylistic grammar which builds sentences out of syntactic stylistic shapes defined by their characteristic integrating effect,, we can c.onstruct, at the next level, a grammar which relates constituent eb ements of style to patterns of syntactic stylistic shapes.

Note that our stylistic grammar also gives patterns of stylistic elements which tend to oppose a certain stylistic goal. For example, an initial discord, a disjunct dependent [non-finite] clause, followed by a medial discord, an antijunct postmodification, a postposed adjective, tends to suppress clarity in the following .~entence: To illustrate the benefits of assertiveness, politicians, eloquent, capture our interest.","In these next two sentences, we see an effect of syntactic concreteness, an attempt to express the immediacy of the world in the syntactic structure. The first sentence contains a medial counterpoise: Now demons, whatever else they may be [nominal relative clause], are full of interest. The second example contains a dissolution: And the rain descended [simple concordant major] and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon the house; and it fell: [concordant dependent clause due to the imitation] and great was the fall of it [discordant major due to the inversion of the subject and predicate] [Matthew, 7:27].","We can now begin to see how our vocabulary of constituent elements~ the central level of our stylistic grammar, will apply to the development of a semantic stylistic grammar. In the following two sentences, for example, we see seman~,ie counterpoise, the main idea interrupted by a secondary one: The university attended by the Prime Minister, one of the finest law schools in the country, is the alma mater of many prominent politicians. Compare this with: The university attended by the Prime Minister, a set of buildings with the architectural charm of a prison, is the alma mater of many prominent politicians. In the first case, the offset supports the main idea so that there is an overall effect of stylistic concord but, in the second example, the intruding phrase is semantically and stylistically discordant,","In more subtle ways, we can correlate stylistic elements with patterns of semantic structure. In the following sentences, note the difference in order of components between 11 a regardg dans le jardin par la porte ouverte and its English translation, He gazed out of the open door into the garden. In French, the result comes first, then the means, while English follows the order of the images, like a film of the action [Vinay and Darbelnet 1958]. We would say that that are three types of semantic stylistic shapes composing the sentence: he gazed, out of the open door, and into the garden. In the English sentence, the modulations between shapes seem small, so that there is a gradual unfolding of images, an effect of concreteness, while the French structure contains a pattern of modulations characteristic of abstraction.","So far, we have put forward stylistic grammars as the formal representation of English and French internal stylistics. This approach has led us to organize a stylistic vocabulary describing sentence components in terms of stylistic shapes and then to define rules relating stylistic elements to patterns of these shapes. The next step, associating stylistic goMs with stylistic elements allows us, in effect, to correlate syntactic structures with these goals.","With an explicit correlation between syntactic grammar rules, stylistic grammar rules, and stylistic goals, we can now propose a strategy :for the English and French stylistic parser that we will construct. The syntactic rules do the driving but partial stylistic decisions can affect the direction of the syntactic parse. That is, once a stylistic rule has been partially recognized, we can narrow the search space for constructs to complete the rule. As the syntactic rules analyse sequences of syntactic structures, these structures can then be recognized as sequences of stylistic elements, the components of stylistic rules. In tandem, the stylistic rules will pick up a sequence of stylistic elements mid associate it with a stylistic goal. The idea of tandem rules in language analysis is developed by Hirst [1987]. This approach to integrating syntax and semantics has been adapted to syntax and stylistics."]},{"title":"5 Summary","paragraphs":["Our recent work has been the construction of a goal-directed stylistic grammar for English internal stylistics.
