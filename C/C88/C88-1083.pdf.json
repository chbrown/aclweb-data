Functorial variables render to be a possible integrating representation of both assertion and presupposition in one and the same logical formula different from such using classical conjunction. O~ Introduction","From a computational point of vlew there is an important difficulty of an adequate formalization of both assertion and presupposition, It rests on dividing utterances into an explicit part (assertion) and an implicit one (presupposition).","Frege 118921 refused any explication of this implicit part, because of hls ideallza= t/on that logic deals only with correct ~tatemerlts. At least in regard of definite descriptions Russell /1905/ pleaded for such an explication. But classical conjunction was one of its essential formal tools. To a certain extent assertion and presuppoeltion were represented at one and the same level. Strawson /1950/ claimed that presuppositions have to be explicated, but not at the same level like the implicit part. Many linguists = e, g. Klefer 11973/ - believe that logical means can be used to represent both parts of utterances aeparately~ but these representa-tions cannot be put together in one and the same logical expreeslon~ because Russell's solution Is unsatisfactory.","My intention is to show that functorlal variables render to be possible tools for integrating representation of both assertion and presupposition in one and the same logical formula, Moreover - unlike Bergmann i1981/, OunglKOstner /19861 - this representation Is a svntactlcal one and different from that given by means of classical con-"]},{"title":"Junction (cp, Max l1986/i /forthcoming/).","paragraphs":["1.

It hoZds= A formula A of G ls valid lff its corresponding classical formula AE1A A E2 is valid. There are some specific differences between the starting formula with FV'e and its analogous formula without FV'eo One important difference is the following= After replacing the propositional variables by values 1 or 0 the formula A gets none of these values and it remains ,up eatured. Only if this formula ls transmitted in one of its both closed substitutions - A E$ or A E2 -, then it gets e value. With respect to formulas with FV's which are neither tautologies nor contradictions there is another Important difference: Let A be 409 such a formula. Then often A ~-~(AE1A- A E2) is not valid, 3, Assertion and presupposition The introduction of expressions of the form G~,6Plq i_ renders to be a possible unconventional approach to assertion and presupposition. I postulate that the p-propositional variables represent elsments of a set of assertions, and the corresponding q-variables represent elements of a set of presuppositions.

In order to form s correct translation of such compound sentences their simple parts should be translated into expressions of the form G 2 . Let A G be a G-formula of G. Then 4,6Piql we can put on the following generalization of our interpretation: A GEl .- assertion expression A GE2 - presupposition expression. So ws get a new syntactical method to explicate assertion and presupposition in one and the same formula. Unlike 4-valued/2-dimensional approaches our language possesses an enrlchment of syntactical expressive power. 4.
