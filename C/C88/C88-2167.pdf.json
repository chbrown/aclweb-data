It is to be desired that pattern matching of the unfruitful rules should be avoided. This paper proposes a method to restrict the rule application by activating rules dynamically. • The logical relationship among rules are pre-mmlyzed and a set of antecede/lt actions, which are prerequisite for the condition of 9/]e rule being satisfied~ is determined for each ruleo In execution time, a rule is activated only when one of the antecedent actions are carried out. The probability of a rule being activated is reduced to near the occurrence probability of its relevant linguistic phenc~nono As most rules relate to linguistic phenc~msa that rarely occur, the processing efficiency is drastically inrproved. I. Introduction A practical machine translation system needs to deal with a wide variety of linguistic phencm~J%a. A large and sophisticated grammar will be developed over a long period~ Accordingly, it is necessary to adopt an implementation method which ir~0r~;es the extensibility and maintainability of the system° .The rule based approach [i] is a prc*nising one from this viewpoint. However, a rule based systes~ is generally disadvantageous in processing efficiency. In rule based machine translation, a gr~,mar is comprised with a lot of rewriting rules [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]. Translation is carried out by repeating pattern matching and transformation of tree or graph structures that represent the syntax or s~mtics of a sentence. A great part of the processing time is spent in pattern n~%tching~ which mostly results in failure. The key to improve the processing efficiency is how to avoid the pattern matching that results in failure° A number of methods such. as the Rete pattern match algorithm [5] have been devel~ped to ini0rove the processing efficiency of rule based systems. However, peculiarities in machine 'translation systems make it difficult to apply the whole of an existing method° The general idea of existing methods is to restructure the set of rules in a network such as a cause-effect graph~ or a descriminant network, and maintain the state of the object in the network. The following are distinguishing features of a machine translation system° First, the object data is a graph 824 structttre, and tile st~rt~ of 19~e object must ~.m handle~] as a collection of slates of respective sub4]raphs~ which are created dynamically by applying rules o Therefore, maintaining the state of the object in a network causes a large amount of overhead.

Lastly, the effectiveness of %/le proposed ~thod is discussed in Section 5~","2. Grammar Descr~ for Rule Based Machine Translation 2 o i ~ect data structure A machine translation syst~n deals with the syntax and semantics of a natural l~guage sentenc~ which is represented by tree or graph structures~ The object data in our machine translation syst~n is a directed graph. A directed graph consists of a set of nodes and arcs connecting a pair of nodes. ~ch node has a number of attributes and each arc has a label. ~e label of an arc can be regarded as a kind of attribute in the tail node of the arc~ The attributes are divided into sca~pe attxibntes and set-type attribetes. A scalar-type attribute is e~le in which only ~ne value is given to a node° A set-type attribute is one Jm whic~h ~ than ~ value nmy be given to a node~ In Japanese-~glish machine translations a ~e corresponds to a bumm~tsu in a Japanese ~t~Oeo A .b~nsetsu is o~rised witkt a co~itent ~rd and %k~ succeeding fnnction words o The follo~r'±ng a~e treated as attributes of nodes; parts of speech,. s~mm%tie features, function words~ dependent, types~ governor typese surface case markers~ se~mmtic roles (case), and others. 2.2 Gramn~tical rules A granm~tical rule is written in the form of a graph-to-g, raph rewriting ruleo T]~t is8 a xu]e consists of a condition part and an action part o The condition part. specifies the pattern of a","condition","* @X ~ T :~ [ t, t' ] (a : @Y) ; @Y ~ U = u ! u'","(a : @z ) ;","@Z ~ V ~ @X.V ;","action @X ( + a : @z ] ;","@Y ( -- a : @Z ) ; (a) Coding form"]},{"title":"Eli)","paragraphs":["(b) Illustrative form F:i.go l An _exf?~J3]e of a ~ranm]atical rule subgrapb, and tile action part does a transformation to I~ performed on subgraphs that **retch the patLeml s[~.oified .in the condition part:.

The pattern marcher first binds the key node variable in the rule with the current node. Then, it binds the other node variables with nodes in the object data one after another, searching for a node which satisfies the conditions relevant to each node variable. If all the node Variables in the rule are bound with nodes, the pattern matcher judges that the condition part of the rule is satisfied at %/~e current node. If there exists a node variable that caD/lot be bound with a node, the pattern marcher judges t/]at the condition is not satisfied at the current node. The transformer performs the action part of a rule. It is called only when the pattern matcher judges that the condition part of the rule issatisfied. As the pattern matcher has bound each node variable with a node in the object data, the appropriate portion of the object data structure undergoes the transformation. The grammar executor described above leaves room for improven~nt in efficiency. The behavior of rules in the naive grammar executor shows the following characteristics. - The proportion of rules that succeed in pattern matching is very small. It is less than one percent in the case of our Japanese sentence analysis grammar which is ecmprised of several thousand rules. - The probability that a rule succeeds in pattern matching varies widely with rules. While some rules succeed fairly frequently, most other rules rarely succeed. In the naive implementation of grammar executor, all the rules are treated equally. As a result, a great part of ~ the processing time is spent in pattern matching of unfruitful rules. If application of ' • unfruitful rules can be avoided, the processing efficiency will be drastically improved. Same rules can be directly linked to specific words. Application of such word specific rules can be easily restricted by linking them with the dictionary. Our concern here is how to restrict application of general rules that cannot be linked directly to specific words. 4. Dynamic Rule Activation 4.1 Basic idea ~ether the condition part of a rule is satisfied or 826 not ge~nerally depends on the results of preceding rules, q~e logical relationship an~0ng rules can be extracted by static analysis of the grammar° A considerable application of unfruitful rules will be prevented by using the logical relationship among rules. First, we define an ~tecedent set for a condition. The anteoedent set for a condition is such a set of actions as: (i) carrying Out a member action causes the possibility that the condition is satisfied, and (ii) the condition is never satisfied if no men~xe.r action is carried out. Then, we define the inverse action for a/l antecedent set. The inverse action for an antecedent set is an action that cancels the effect of any me~ber action of the antecedent set° An antecedent set and its inverse action can be used to dynamically change the status of a rule as follows. A rule is activated when a member action of the antecedent set for the condition of the rule is carried out. A rule is deactivated when the inverse action is carried out° It is obviously assured that a rule is active whenever its condition may ~e satisfied. Thus~ the application of inactive rt116s can be skipped. More than one antecedeat set can usually be obtained for a oondition. The optimal antecedent set is one that minimizes the probability of activating a rule~ The optimal antecedent set is one of min~nal antecedent, sets. The minimal anteoedent set is such an antecede/It set as any subset is not an anteoedent set for the same condition. In order to choose the optimal antecedent set among ,~inimal anteoedent sets, occurrence statistics of actions should be gathered using a corpus of texT. 4.2 ~s of~ammar 4.2.1 Amtecedent set for 10rimitive oondition We are not interested in all the antecedent sets but the optimal one for the condition of each ruleo q~erefore, we turn our attention to intra-node cenditions. Intra-node conditions usually give us an effective anteoedent set, while inter--node conditions do not. %~le minimal antecedent sets for an intra-node condition are as follow. Here, antecedent sets are defined separately for each node (indicated by i below), as the truth value of a oondition varies with nodes. It is necessary to consider two cases. One is that the attribute in the condition is not related to any inter-node action. ~ne other is that the attribute in the condition is related to sQme / nter-node actions. (I) When the attribute is not related to any inter-node action, the truth value of a condition at a node i is effected only by actions at the same node i. \"therefore, only the actions at the same node i are included in the antecedent set. e.g., The minimal antecedent sets for a condition"]},{"title":"Ti","paragraphs":["p [ t, t' ] are [ T i = T i + It] ] and"]},{"title":"Ti=Ti+[t'] ] .","paragraphs":["A comment should be given on cfm~posite actions.

Therefore, 'the antecedent sets need to include the actions at all the nodes. e.g., The minimal antecedent sets for a condition","TiP [ t, t' ] are"]},{"title":"[ Tj = ~i + [t] , j=l,..,N ] and [ Tj = T~ + It'] I j=l,\",N ] .","paragraphs":["e.g°, -The ~tinimal antecedent set for a condition"]},{"title":"Tin [ L,t' ]¢@ is [ Tj = Tj + [t] ,","paragraphs":["Tj -- Tj + It'] !","j=I,..,N ] .","In this case, obviously the antecedent sets for a","rule are camDn to all the nodes. On the other, hand, we cannot obtain effective antecedent sets from an inter-node condition. For instance, the minimal antecedent set for an Jmter-node condition T i = Tj must include actions Tj = T i + [ t ] (for any t), as T i = T i + [ t \"] make true the condition together with Tj = Tj + [ t ]. Accordingly, the minimal antecedent set includes a large number of actions and has a rather large occurrence probability. 4.2.2 Antecedent set for rule A minimal antecedent set for a condition or a rule is synthesized by those for the constituent primitive conditions. For this purpose, 1\"/~e cendition )~rt of a rule is transforme~ into con jtu~ctive canonical form. The conjunctive 'canonical form is a logical AkD of terms, each term being a logical OR of one or more primitives. In Fig. 4r the condition part of the rule in Fig. 1 is shown in conjunctive canonical form. In the oonj[mctive canonical form, a term is true if anyone of t/~ primitives is trHe, and it is false if all the pr~nitives are false. Therefore, the union of the minimal antecedent sets of the primitives is that for the term. Here, the detailed procedure is separated J~to two cases. In the case of the term being relat~ to the key node variable in the rule, t/~e minimal antecedent sets for the node concerned should be t~ited. On the contrary, in case the term is related to a node variable other than the key node variable, the minimal antecedent sets for all the nodes should be united, because any node may, as a result of structural change, occupy the location that oorresixgnds to the node variable the term is related to (See Fig. 5). The condition, a logical A~) of terms, is totally true if and only if all the terms are true.

Then, t/he grammatical rules are modified as follow. When the action part of a rule R' includes a member action of the antecedent set for a rule R, the action to activate R is added to the action part of R'. Likewise, when the action part 'of a ~ule R\" includes the inverse action of the antecedent set for a rule R, the action to deactivate R is added to the action part of R\". We should add a comment on the s£atus of a ruleo In principle, a status is defined for ead] node. However, when the antecedent set is related to a ncde variable other than the key node variable, or an attribute relating to scme inter-node actions, a status cfmm~n to all the nodes is defined. 4.4 Improved 9rammar executor An .improved grm~m~- executor whid~ exec[~tes the l~odifJ.ed gran~k~r is il].ustrate<] in Fig° 6. A status table indicating the status of rules is introduced° It is updated by both the initializer and the trensformer, and looked up by the contro]ler~ 'l~ne initializer ac.~ivates the rules in whJ ch the antecedent set includes an action in the process to create the initial object data° The transformer performs rule activating/deactivating actions include~] in the m<x]ified grammar.

The gap between the probabilities of 'active' and ' success' varies with rules. Fig~ 7 illustrates two extreme cases. Fig. 7(a) is a case in which there is a minimal en~tecedent set for which occurrence probability is near the probability of t/~e condition being satisfied. Fig. 7(b) is a case in w~dch there is no such ndnimal antecedent set. As a matter of fact~ (a) is a usual case and (b) is s rare case. A rule usually has a key condition featuring its relevant ]ing[d.stic phenomenon, from which an effective antecedent set can be obtained° ~herefore~ the probability of 'active' is reduced to the same order as the probability of 'success'.

Moreover, although looking up the status of rules occurs frequently, its load is far smaller t/~1 that of pattern matching, which would be repeated if the dynamic rule activation were not used. ~erefore, the overhead caused by dynamic rule activation can be neglected. Another effect of the proposed method is that it can be applied to on-d~d loading of rules when the |1~anory a~pacity for a grammar is limited. That is, while rules with a large probability of 'active' are made resident on the main memory, the other rules are loaded when they are to ~ applied. Thus the frequency of loading rules is minimized. 6. Conclusion An efficient execution method for rule based machine translation systems has been developed. ~e essence of the met21od is as follows. Firs t, a grammar is pre-analyzed to determine an antecedent set for each rule. The ~tecedent set for a rule is a set of actions such that perfo~r£ing an action in it causes the possibility of the condition of the rule being satisfied, and the condition of the rule is unsatisfied if any action in it is not performed. At execution time, a rule is activated only when an action in Ule antecedent set for the rule is perfol~=d° qhe rule application is restricted to active rules. The probability of a rule being active is reduced to near the occurrence probability of its relevant linguistic phenomenon. Thus most pattern l,~tching of unfruitful rules is avoided.
