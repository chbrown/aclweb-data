Research had therefore to be based on the original program developed four years earlier. An overhaui of the set of rules taking into account syllabification and the graphemic system of French as set forth by N. Cataeh (1980) was not, For all practical purposes, possible.","Consequently, if the above-described phonological system chosen for representing common French pronunciation little differs from the one used by N. Catach (1984), our graphic system is not always based on graphemes, now considered as the units in this system, As a result, for instance, we have rules For the graphic forms aill and all instead of rules for the graphemes i11 and il preceded by 2. This, and the lack of syllabification, is no doubt a cause of some lesser efficiency in the text to phonetics correspondences. Whereas N. Catach's program consists of 240 basic grapheme-phoneme rules, ours is made up of some 325 such rules, directly evolved from the original basic program.","However, as said earlier, our primary objective in the present research was to correctly transcribe the maximum number of words belonging to the general lexicon while dealing with homographs and liaison in discourse in a more sophisticated way. 3.2 Tools","In order to greatly improve upon the original program~ rules had to be tested against large corpuses.","The first was made up of the French Pronunciation Dictionary by A. Martinet and H. Wal~er (1973) based on actual usage, and not on a prescriptive norm. The dictionary is made up of some 50,000 words, out of which lO,O00, chosen for the investigation, register variations in pronunciation. A computer program was written for checking the pronunciation of each word, as given by the program rules, against the first - or only - end any other pronunciation registered in the dictionary (of. Appendix C). Statistics of matches against 672 first, second.., tenth pronunciation were simultaneously computed, as shown below for all words starting with letter a: .............. *> File Statistics Total words in file :4322 Total words checked :4322 lotal words 1 i sted : 525 Form number of matches: 4022 %=93.06 ======~==> Breakdown of matches : Matches in pron # 1 are:3630 %=83.99 Matches in prnn # 2 are: 372 %= (l.6t Matches in pron # 3 are: 14 %= 0.32 Matcbe.~ in pron # 4 are: 2 %= 0.05 Hatclln~ in preen # 5 are: 2 %: 0.05 Matches in pron # 6 are: 0 %: O.

O0 As a result, non matches as recorded on print-outs allowed for systematic correction of faulty rules, and, consequently, continuous improvements to the algorithm. It was moreover possible, when a word was mispronounced in the dictionary or in a text, to detect which rule, or ordering, was involved. The following example shows how 811 the rules involved in the pronunciation of a word could be listed: [ ]= []= [P]=pP [e]CC=eh [eh]=sh [b]=bb"]},{"title":"[i]=ii","paragraphs":["pechbl[en]de =ehnn [d]=dd"]},{"title":"tel-= [ ]=","paragraphs":["French: pechblende IPA: ppehahbbllehnndd","As numerous non matches - not considered aa genuine pronunciation errors but rather aa possible variations - resulted from transcriptions with open instead of closed unstressed, vowels, or vice-versa, in the ease of E, 0 and EU, the neutralization applying to A (selection of one phoneme, the front one) was extended for eorreotion~s sake. Real pronunciation errors were then made to stand-out in the print-outs, and facilitated systematic correction of errors in the rules. As far as the graphic=to-phonetics rules themselves are concerned, to the exclusion of other types of rules (for liaisons, homographs, etc...), correction stopped when it was felt that the rules produced an optimal phonetic transcription (of. Appendix D) considering the system used. Given the fact that there are many permitted variations even within standard pronunciation, in particular in unstressed syllables, comprumlses had to be often reached in the development of the rules.","IL should not, however, be construed from the use of Martinet & Waiter's dictionary that it was used as a model of \"good\" French pronunciation to be reproduced. It was basically used, as mentioned earlier above, as a tool for systematic corrections of tile rules, as well as a reference dictionary registering variations in pronunciation. In the development of the conversion rules between graphic forms and tlleir phonetic representation, constant use was made of other reference works, mainly of Le Petit Robert (PR) and the Dictionary of --\" r'Fr~6unc~n ~ Ao Lerond (Larousse, 1980). In fact no effort at all was made to reproduce some features to be found in the general pronunciation revealed by the data such as the pronunciation of geminates and the use of"]},{"title":"/o%/vs/E/.","paragraphs":["]he second corpus, made up of texts, as opposed to lists of single words, also consisted of some 50,000 words. These were mainly articJes found in French and Quebec general information magazines. They were not only intended as a further way of checking on graphic=phonetic rules but, above all, as s means of enhancing rules for liaisons and homographs.","tie will now briefly discuss two major areas oH which tile research focused. 4. Treatment of liaisons","improvements to the earlier basic program proce,)ded along two lines: e) increasing the number of words causing obligatory, and to s lesser extent semi-obligatory, liaisons; b) refining on rules taking more liaison contexts into account without creating forbidden liaisons eL the same time. 4.1 5electio. of words making up liaison rules","llere again, a balance had to be struck between the will to take as many liaison, contexts into account, and the over extension of the rules, not to mention that absolutely all liaison possibilities cannot be allowed for selection or words causing liaison - to be added to lists in original program based on Juilland frequency list - was further made a) according to frequencies given in the Basic Orthographic Lists or LO__BB (Catach, 1984);-~b) linguistic awareness, since it was no longer s matter of focusing on a 5,000 but on s 50,000 word lexicon. Memory limitations on the program contributed moreover all along to reduce the list of liaison rules as much as possible, l o this effect, semi-obligatory liaieons were generally only entered for verbs, and the decision was finally taken because it was felt they made comprehension of synthetic speech easier.","The program includes close to 300 - mostly obligatory - liaison rules, out of which some 180 for adjectlves alone. Here is an example of such a rule (of. Appendix B) vii[sin ]L=ehnn; It reads in a liaison context L the masculine adjective ending is pronounced like the feminine.","In the earlier programs, all liaison rules looked like the above. Liaison was always applied, except before a consonant or so called aspirated h words. These have ts be listed, and liaison is prevented before them through the use of a macro symbol referring to their list. llowever, applying liaison to all other vowel initial words is bound to cause unwanted liaisons such as in: II est vllain eL r~ossit 4.2 UBe of ~croe","It was eonsequently necessary to introduce constraints on the context of application of liaison rules, and this was accomplished through the use of two different macro symbols. The first, E, prevents application of the liaison rule only before s consonant initial or an aspirated h word. The second, L, restrict liaison beTore entire parts of speech. In this case before prepositions (P), relative and interrogative pronouns (R), conjunctions (J) and verbs (B). These complex macros - as opposed to simple ones such as V for vowel and C for consonant - therefore require lists of words to be available to the system. To increase efficiency, such lists |lad to be drawn and ordered in terms of the frequency of the words to be included.","By preventing liaison before vowel initial words belonging to specific parts of speech represented by other macro symbols, and included in lists available to the system~ the use of the macro symbol L in liaison rules allows for a correct transcription, without liaison, of","' usually a determiner, in such a context","We: Le premier/el man second se ressemblent.","It must, however, be obvious that the treatment of ambiguities, in the case of liaison or homographs, through the immediate context of the word involved in the rule, has its limitations. Beeides the fact that all parts of speech are not represented, macros end the lists they make available to the system are far from being exhaustive. 4.3 @so of hard vs. Bolt hyphe.","The presence of an hyphen after, or before a word, or part of a word, to which a liaison rule applies, is bound to modify the nature of the liaison. Forinstance, if final s in ~tats can be pronounced /z/ in des Elate un~s2~_a [ des liens 4conomique8, liaison must be'made in let ~'tats'-unis. Similarly a third person singular verbal ending in d should be pronounced /t/ then followed by on hy-pheo and a personal pronoun (inversion of the subject) whereas liaison is optional or forbidden in other eases. 673","fol' such reasc)o,'+~ Lwe different type.~ of hypllen were introduced° The presence of:' a hard (H) in o rule wiJl I;[;]IJSl] Lhe tulo' ko apply .~,~]iL[~{"]},{"title":".;kf l~h/',£p..j.j, L2 hy~?he~±/xt t.~h~! tgxt~ The rule :","paragraphs":["[ed]HV=eeLl ; will make. the fJ.nal ed be pronounced /eL/ ~N a 1.iai,,;on context such an in sled-i] or mends Lory hyphen°","Use of h~rd hyi')h(!;n has khu. <~. .several adwmtages as 71 resLl?i.cLe the app]ical:ioi o[' ~ t'ule, in 1;i.aieen a~; wc,1], a;.i other eoses~ Hlld therefore reduce,':} Lhc everal.1 size of tllfJ i)rogram, il; prov[;(J pa.',zLicu],orl.y usei\"tJl il-I the ease Of com[]oorid~J, t:or Jlls~aHce s it ~ilJ.ows for generalization of liaison irlva].ving Lhe final conFlonant of the first 6)]eliien]: of a compotlndi 88 in"]},{"title":"[t:]tt=tLi","paragraphs":["(2ot--au feel and also"]},{"title":"dit-.i]:,.)","paragraphs":["Any slich generalization will of course entail listing rules accounting for exceptions (%hat--hua)Dt.) and will. cause some new compounds ts be incorrectly proneulleed (1.esL~ut.s2].t--","On the oLher hand, the use off a soft hyphen (-.)
