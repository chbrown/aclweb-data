I. IN'fRODUCrlON The context in which we strutted devclopping the system described ia this paper is the I~NPRIT project #860, 'I.,inguistic Analysis of the European I.,anguages', which deals with seven European languages.","The rnah~ objective of the project is to provide a language independe~t softw,'we enviromnent for dealing with the linguistic phase of a number of applications in the re'din of office a/ito:mation such as high quality, natural soundhlg text-to-speech ~:onversion for unlimited vocabularies, automatic speech recognition for large vocabularies, and omni-font optical character reading includhlg automatic reading of handwriting.","The decision on what type of linguistic model to be used ill the project was made at an early stage. It was decided to aim at a probabilistic positional gramnrar (a Mmkov-type grammar) based on transition probabilities of pairs and triplets of syntactic categories. Tile use of Matkov-type models immediately incurs the necessity of defilting training texts. We started out with trainhlg corpora of approximately 100,000 words of official EEC publications, that were available hi all languages of the community. The training consists of buildhlg a number of data structures. 'File first is a lexicon of ,'111 words that occur in the text, with their attendmlt probability of occurl~uce and all possible wordclasses. The second structme is formed by two and three dimensional matrices describing the transition probabilities between pairs or triplets, respectively, of wordclasses. Clearly, the probabililies specified depend on the choice of syntactic categores along the dimensions. One of the major problems with a Malkoviml approach is to determine the optimal level of detail of the wordclasses for each dimension. In tiffs paper we will describe a softwale systetn that helps linguists ha carrying out experitnents aimed at finding an 'optitnal' system of wordclasses.","2. MARKOW ANALYSIS OF LARGE CORPORA AND WORDCLASS SYSTEMS The prOblem of finding a suitable wordclass set for statistical disambiguation of syntactic labelling may be fommlated more precisely and fomlally as follows: Find a set of wordelass labels (with gross wordclass and complex information) that can label each word of a language and","1. is minimal in the number of labels (economy requirement)","2. provides high predictive power for adjacent wordclasses in a chain.

(information requirement)","To find an exact solution to this problem is difficult - if not impossible, because of the dimensionality of the optinfization problem (given the large number of wordclasses needed to obtain useful parsing results)","- the difficulty to define a unique starting set of wordclasses for an optimization the dependence of a possible finite solution on the analysed corpus","Our approach to this problem is to start from a very detailed hierarchical wordclass system including complex information. Tile degree of detail can be reduced by means of the notion of \"cover symbols\" that form partifioltings of the original system. Cover symbols and w0rdclasses not accounted for by cover symbols are called 'labels'. Initially, cover symbols will be created by combining wordclass symbols for related classes - e.g. the classes \"verb, 1. person singtdar indicative present active\" and \"verb, 1. per:;on singular conjunctive present active\" giving a cover symbol \"verb, 1. person singular present active\". At a later stage other cover symbols can be created by combining and excluding wordclass symbols and already existing cover symbols. ][~a the optimization process different sets of.\" labels are created subsequently mad compared by measmes ~elated to either of the criteria mentioned.","A user working in the optimization process ~eeds meas~ ures to compare the significance of individual labels within a given set and to estimate the usefulness of joining labels i~,~to new, more comprehensive cover symbols'. Az one measur~ for criterium two we use the entropy directly in a global ~nd diagnostic way. Additionally a number of measures have been defined that are related to entropy and give more specific information on the performance of individual labels.","Given a text in which to each word a label has beetg assigned that is:","1. the basic wordclass, if this has not been defined as belonging to a cover symbol 2. file applicable covet\" symbol otherwise","and given a 2D-matrix that contains relative frequencies of transitions from any label (wordclass or cover symbol) to any other label in the text, then some useful rueastn'es are the branclfing factor for a given label, that tells how many different labels actually followed/preceeded it in an analysed text. file variance of the transition probabilities in a row/cob umn of the matrix, that indicates how much the strength of connections from the label to sttrrotmding labels varies as ,analysed fi~om a text. tile correlation between different rows/columns of the matrix, that gives information about how similarly the labels behave in a general right/left context, i.e. how much itffomtation will be lost by combining two labels into a new cover symbol. file relative frequency of a given label, that indicates tile relative labelling relevance wiflfin a given system.","The measures defined here for a 2D-matrix, can be applied to a 3D-matrix in a similar way, e.g. the colxelafion between two labels in the same matrix dimellsion then means cox~relating the numbers of two planes. 50","3~ .~(]]~[},,:i?:,: .i',]/! ;i'~?,4'.1',:}i'~ ~.;OJt !,.Di¢~'IU.CI;,5; ILttOM i'~,i~k'>il.,{;~.'t)'V A i'q<t_,f ,'i(~;)Z~:; %1 ~rder to a:~si~;~ ~hGuists h~ thch' ta.'& of dc.<~ig~& G -'~x opli-- ma~ se~ oJ:\" ',,:,o.~'delasst,~:*: ~<:,,t; desig:~;;:d ~ too/ ca!icd g-\",l',/tivig.: F, dJtor ~7o_r Jv(a~G.c~s :i)~'o~:a ]~L'~d~:~>v ['.!Y, ltys[s, \"..lie ~.,'.(~,~;t Jwzportant des_~.g~ <:oi~si¢:lf::~;tt~o~s re;"]},{"title":"ik~llJll;iDeiililli' j ~]le Sy:,;t'L~xIi a,'e:","paragraphs":["(~EVc{O[) cOV~;\" t~yiu?'.bo] :~::TG a~Taly~'c:: )0~_,tat:i~ees a~td !r~!~x'; a,.ILp~i~ d 7~,!.,';o ~,d.~a~ded itclp ~.c a'¢aJtable at ev<.',.~y poJat","3, [ ~'.L,o J~ L;;.; ~ .(].,.s~ tooi ~ox' c)q>c_,J,.a,c,~d ~,.~:;;:i'm 't<lit;y cau C2C,~!'~ ~q}~]i: C0t]I~JA~lid i]il, S ~)y tlle]lisi:ivt;s Of I/so tile: J~Ggi~G .('acflity~",";';td~MA is ~@it .h'~tc, two _~ogical pa~ls, though they ace ck~scly rob'rEdo h~ ttw. fi~'gt pa~.l a user ~al~ c.r,<:at,:~ a set of cove.,.' sy.a~hoJ:~, /~. s;~.4~x~r~tie~d i'onnalism has beta, defined ~)~x ,-;pt;',:i~'yi~g c:ovcr symbols iu a hJeraccificaJ way: rc.cm' sive]y -:;;;ts :d i~.b~;h.; ~my be put imo lists, th,:at sw.:h li~:ts t;e e::ch~dex! from oih~r lists k~ ,<:p,;:eKy the fm~{ set of word-c|as~es co~/tai,.a;d ]~_ a ee~tail~ Cover sy~fl~ol, (sc;e al;pelldix for ~totatiorO","}h:i.el~ ,,;3 rebels can be defined for ¢:ach dimetlsiou.
