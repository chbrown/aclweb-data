However, it seems impossible to implement GPSG in its 1985 version straightforwardly. This would involve a vast overgeneration of structures as well as processes to filter out everything but the admissible tree(s). We therefore argue for a constructive version of GPSG where information is gathered in subsequent steps to produce syntactic structures. As a result, we consider it necessary to incorporate procedural aspects into the formalism in order to use it as a linguistic basis for NL parsing and generation. The paper discusses the major implications of such a modified view of GPSG. 1 1 Introduction","Any attempt to build a multi-lingual MT system as in EUROTRA [King, Perschke 1987] must provide for massive modularization in order to avoid developing 9 parsers, 9 generators and 72 transfer components for the 9 languages involved, not to mention the different but redundant formulations of linguistic knowledge embodied in them. The most obvious approach consists in developing one single parser, one single generator, and one single transfer component, the first two being capable of dealing with grammars for different languages and the latter with transfer","1 This work has been developed in the project KFr-FAST (KIT = Kilnstliche Intelligenz und Textverstehen (Artificial Intelligence and Text Understanding); FAST = Functor Argument Structure for Translation), which constitutes the Berlin component of the complementary research project of EuroWa-D. It receives grants by the Federal Minister for Research anti Technology under contract 1013211. rules for different pairs of languages. Moreover, an MT system must be based on a linguistically justified theory of grammar. This theory has to be implemented in the system, where it determines the construction of a syntactic representation of a sentence during the parsing of some input string as well as during the generation based on the output of the transfer component.","The theory of GPSG (see [Gazdar et al. 1985], henceforth: [GKPS]) has been tested for its usefulness for MT [ttauenschild/Busemann 1988]. It offers the high degree of modul,'u'ity that is required. For instance, an implementation of the GPSG formalism would be able to run with different grammars, and linguistic generalizations would either evolve from the formalism (in the case of universals), or be expressible within the grammars (in the case of language-specific generalizations). We shall distinguish between the formalism and the grammar in the following way; the formalism consists of the Feature Instantiation Principles (FIPs), the formal definition of syntactic features, categories, Feature Co-occurrence Restrictions (FCRs), Immediate Dominance (ID) rules, Linear Precedence (LP) statements, admissible trees, etc. The grammars consist of actual sets of ID rules, LP statements, FCRs, and the lexicon.","However, a closer look at the axiomatic way GPSG has been defined reveals severe problems for an implementation of GPSG. In the next section we shall outline these problems, and in section 3 present our change in perspective towards a GPSG formalism that overcomes these problems. Some consequences of this are discussed in the last section.","The rest of the paper concentrates on GPSG and its use for processing of representations of natural language sentences. Nothing can be said here about the necessity of including textual knowledge for translation or about the transfer step itself (but cf. [Hauenschild 1986]). 77 2 Problems With the Implementation of GPSG","In this section we want to justify why we had to develop a constructive version of the GPSG formalism although it might seem that the \"classical\" version of it (as defined in [GKPS]) can be implemented. We want to show that this is only true in theory but not in practice. What would it really amount to if we tried to implement the","axiomatic version of GPSG in a straightforward way? In order","to find all admissible trees corresponding to a given sentence,","we would have to do the following things for every local tree","(i.e. trees of depth 1):","* build every possible extension for every category in an ID rule, which means that every feature that is not specified in the rule may be either absent or specified by any of its values,",". filter out the illegal categories with the aid of the FCRs,",". build all the possible projections of ID rules with the remaining legal categories, thereby creating every possible order of the daughters,","• filter out those combinations of categories that are inadmissible according to the Foot Feature Principle (FFP), Control Agreement Principle (CAP) or Head Feature Convention (HFC),",". filter out those projections that are unacceptable because of some category contradicting a Feature Specification Default (FSD),","° filter out all those projections that contradict any LP statement applicable to the daughters.","After this, the subset of admissible local trees has to be identified which yields the desired complex structures in the following way: two (locally) admissible trees may be combined into a larger tree iff one of the daughters of one of them is identical with the mother of the other one.","The whole process can be regarded as divided up into three major steps. The first step consists in constructing all the possible projections (possible according to ID rules and FCRs). The second step consists in filtering out local trees that are not admissible according to the restrictions imposed on them by the FIPs, the FSDs and the LP statements. Though these devices are not filters in the Chomskyan sense, 2 they behave in an analogous way by preventing previously generated structures from becoming locally admissible trees. The last step consists in forming complex structures out of locally admissible trees.","In order to show the complexity of such an approach, it is necessary to give a rough idea of what the first step really mnounts to; it yields a combinatorial explosion of the set of categories. Assuming the 25 atomic and the 4 category-valued 2 This was pointed out to us by John Nerbonne (electronic mail). features defined for file English grammar in [GKPS], a lower bound for the number of categories to be checked by the FCRs is 10 774 [Ristad 1986].","'['he second of the above mentioned steps is riot trivial either, though its problems might be solvable after allo For a purely axiomatic view of the GPSG formalism it may be permissible to neglect the order in which the different filtering components are to be applied, akhough their seem to be some problems with the definitions of the different FIPs with respect to their logical independence of each other. For an effective implementation however, the ordering problem becomes crucial. There are some hints in [GKPS] referring to interdependencies between the different filters, but they are not fully specified. The most problematic case is the order in which the HFC and the CAP have to be applied: • the HFC seems to presuppose the effects of the CAP (and of","the FFP) because it must not force feature specifications that","are excluded by the CAP on categories in local trees;","• the CAP presupposes the FlEC in the sense that it is based on semantic types, which are dependent on HEAD features, the distribution of which is in turn governed by the HFC.","One possible way out of this dilemma is suggested in [Shieber 1986], but it is based on the assumption that HEAD features may be split up into two disjoint sets: those HEAD features which are prerequisites for the assignment of semantic types and thus for the applicability of the CAP, and those HEAD features that can safely be applied after the CAP has done its work. However, it is not clear whether such a distribution is possible. Of course, you can always make your ID rules much more informative with respect to feature specifications than is suggested in [GKPS] and thereby guarantee a proper functioning of the FIPs; but that would probably not be in the spirit of GPSG, where the main point is to capture the universal as well as the language-specific generalizations.","There m'e a number of problems with the CAP; we waut to outline just one of them, which has led us to modify this principle. The definition of control in [GKPS] implicitly restricts the functioning of CAP to structures where the functor has no more than one argument (with the exception of those very special cases of control mediators). This cannot be seen from the definition of control [GKPS:88] alone, but may be derived from the interaction of this definition with the conditions on correct type assignment that are imposed on syntactic structures by the principle of functional realization [GKPS, chapter 10]: it follows from beth pm~s of the theoly taken together that a functor can be controlled by its argument only in the case where there is no further argument; otherwise the functor would have to be of a type that differs from what is assumed in the definition of control (intuitively, the type of a functor depends on how many arguments the functor takes). 78","This diffictllty seems quite hard to cope with; if we assume rather flat structures (as we do, on independent grounds, in our German syntax [Preug 1987], see also [Uszkoreit 1984]), then it is not clear which of the different arguments of a functor is to control it; in the case of subject-predicate agreement in German, the subject would have to be marked as the controllc~', which can b~a:dly be done on the basis of the semantic types alone (becaose there seems to be no semantic reason to distinguish ,;ubjects and objects by their semantic type unless we treat subjects as functors operating on VPs as arguments, which would reverse the conlrol relation between them and thus cause all sorts of other problems). The only possibility we can conceive of would be analogous to the concept of argument order as defined in [GKPS] :in oi~er to obtain correctly the interpretations of direct attd indirect objects, but this is a language-particular concept (cf. [GKPS:214], which would not fit ittto a universal principle. 3 A Constntctive View of GPS(~,","Aa the previous section shows, the GPSG formalism in its original version is not suitable for computer implementation. From a processing point of view, it is an obvious rcqt&ement that the components of GPSG should only conslru,zt the well-formed categories and trees, i.e. no garbage should be produced. In order to utilize GPSG for parsing artd generation in a computer system, a change in perspective becomes necessary; instead of deciding for all fully specified categories and all local trees whether they are legal or admissible respectively, we start from a highly underspecified local tree that is admitted by an ID rule and gather information by subsequently applying FCRs and FIPs. Eventually we sttall have a fully specified local tree that is admissible b7 definition.","We shall call this view of GPSG constructive since it allows for the construction rather than the selection of a syntactic structure. In a conslructive version of GPSG, FCRs and F1Ps mainly act as principles of feature transport rather than of t'c~atu re distribution.","One of d~e most important questions for the constructive version is ir~ what order the components of GPSG have to be applied. Since each of them may add further feature specifications to a category in a local tree, the order of application ought to depend on what information must be present for a component to work properly. This can be determined in general by using a monotonic operation such as unification for making categories more and more specific.","This has led us to dispense with any assertions about categories as they are often used in [GKPS]. For instance, the predicate ~ with the meaning that some feature is undefined (i.e. it is nn~: contained in the category) is replaced by a feature value, ~, which is subject to unification. We shall thus say that a featurefi~', undefined if it is specified as <f, ~>.","Tire predicative character of FCRs is also modified towards a functional one by including the assignment of values to features. Formally, an FCR is written catl ~ cat2, where cat1 and cat2 are categories. An FCR applies to a category C iff C is an extension of cat1. C must unify with cat2, otherwise C is not legal.","Let us now discuss the role of the FIPs in a constructive version. We shall start with HFC. In [GKPS], HFC is based oil the free feature specification sets, which are utilized to prevent HFC from rejecting local trees because of HEAD features specified differently at the mother and tile head daughter(s) by virtue of ID rnles, FCRs, the FFP, or file CAP. To generate these sets would again require all possible projections from an ID rule to be produced. As was shown in the previous section, this must lm avoided if a computer implementation is to be supplied.","From the constructive point of view we suggest that the effect of using the free feature specification sets can be attained by ensuring that for a local tree, the work of the FCRs, the FFP and the CAP has been completed before HFC comes into play. tlFC then assures that the so far unspecified HEAD features at the mother are ktentical with the corresponding HEAD feature specifications at the head daughter(s) and vice versa thereby never rejecting a local tree 3. IqFC proceeds as follows; every head daughter that can unify with its mother with respect to the set of HEAD features will do so. Typically, IJEAD includes features for verb form or clause structure. A constituent is marked as head by a binary feature, head, which is specified in the ID rules, thus replacing the meta-notation H in IGKPSI, the meaning of which is completely dependent on its context.","This way HFC is supposed to work in an equally general, but much simpler, fashion than it was possible with the definition in [GKPS]. Moreover, IIFC is capable of coping with multiple heads used for the treatment of certain coordination phenomena; feature specifications are found in the coordinated head daughters, the HEAD feature in question has to be undefined at the mother. This parallels the way multiple heads are treated in [GKPS].","The requirement that the CAP be prior to HFC raises, however, the problem that the CAP cannot be based on semantic types anymore because it is HFC which might provide the major feature specifications necessary to determine tile type of a constituent. Moreover, to be applicable to local trees with more than one argument (in those cases where no control mediator is present), the CAP had","3 After HFC has been applied to a local tree, FCRs may become applicable that were not before, which in turn should cause the HFC to resume its work etc. until nothing is specified anymore. Whether this repetition must actually occur, depends on how the grammar is fonnulated. 7~ to be reformulated, and its place is taken by a purely syntactic mechanism, the Agreement Principle (AP), which is defined ~as follows [Weisweber 1987]; every daughter in a local tree that is ~ marked for agreement must unify with its mother with respect to a subset of features, called AGR. If an AGR feature is undefined, it is ignored by the AP. Any local tree violating the AP is rejected. AGR typically contains features for case, gender, person, or number.

The AP together with HEC provides for subject-verb agreement on the basis of these FCRs. This way of coping with agreement phenomena foregoes with any notion of control. There are no semantic types involved; what agrees with what need not be stated explicitly, it is simply the consequence of the interplay of FCRs, AP, HFC, and the","This approach allows a category to contain feature specifications arising from different agreement relations.

This takes place in the course of tree expansion by adding relevant feature specifications to categories in the tree (to an NP mother, for instance). This information is usually not available in local trees at a deeper level, especially at local trees with lexical categories. Therefore the lexicon should contain word stems (rather than word forms) and, con'espondingly, categories that are unspecified for e.g. number and case. 7","This makes a situation possible that has not been discussed yet; namely, that when FIPs apply to local trees at these deeper levels they may have to cope with unspecified features. There B] is indeed no requirement that AGR or HEAD features must have a value in order to unify. We should like the FIPs to work properly even if features have not yet received a value. In these cases, the feature values in question are co-specified, i.e. they will have the same value as soon as one of them is specified. In our example, number and case specifications are spread over the sub-structure dominated by the NP as soon as the FIPs apply to the local tree where they have been introduced. However, such a delayed specification makes it more difficult to maintain control over whether a category is still legal and whether a local tree still complies with the LP statements. For an elegant solution see [Weisweber 1988], in this volume.","In our present version of GPSG, we use neither metarules nor FSD. However, the linguist ought to still have the possibility of expressing elegantly language-particular generalizations with the aid of metarules. They will be realized in a preprocessing component in order to avoid having to apply them during parsing or during generation.","As for FSDs, we adopt the working hypothesis that they are superfluous if lexical entries are sufficiently specified and free feature instantiation (in the sense of [GKPS]) is not allowed. FSDs are needed in the GPSG version of [GKPS] because free feature instantiation may assign nonsensical values to features, which would never occur if the structure had been built orderly on the basis of sufficient lexical information. In the long run it might be desirable to use the device of FSDs in a constructional version of GPSG, too; namely, for those cases wbere features have not been specified, thougll the whole structure has been completed. However, we shall have to avoid the complexity of FSDs as defined in [GKPS]; a simplified solution might be analogous to our version of HFC for HFC, too, is a default device in the final account.","The constructional version of GPSG presented here constitutes the linguistic basis for parsing and generation of English and German sentences within the Berlin GPSG system. The system is fully implemented in Waterloo Core Prolog using the set of predicates defined by the KIT-CORE Prolog standard [Bittkau et al. 1987], which makes it possible to run it with several other Prolog dialects, too (e.g. Symbolics Prolog). At present, it runs on an IBM 4381 under VM/SP, on a Symbolics 3640 Lisp machine, and on an IBM AT. 4 Conclusion","It has been shown how our constructive version of GPSG avoids the: problem of combinatorial explosion that would have arisen if we had tried to implement the GPSG formalism in its axiomatic version [GKPS] in a straightforward way. Our A stem-form lexicon complemented with lemmatization and inflection procedures is better suited to NL processing anyway, at least if sa'ongly inflecting languages such as German are involved. change in perspective also leads to an impoitant simplification of the HFC because it is no longer necessary to build all the projections of an ID rule for the determination of the free feature specification sets.","The dilemma over the ordering of the CAP and the HFC has been removed too, which is crucial for any implementation of the formalism. But, for this to be achieved, we had to sacrifice part of the generality that characterizes the treatment of control in [GKPS]; ke. although the qnestion of which constituents have to agree with one another is ~Lot answered ir~ a purely idiosyncratic way by the ID rules (because most of the cases can be accounted for by FCRs, which are, as it were, language-specific generalizations), the fact that agreement depends on functor-argument structures is no longer integrated iuto the formalism.","This loss, however, is compensated for by the fact that we can treat agreement in cases which the original CAP could not account for (as in the case where a functor is cont,oiled by one of several arguments).","Although we have had to concentrate our presentation on just a few aspects of the eonsu-uctive view of GPSG, we hope to have made plausible that our modified formalism is, in contrast to the original one, suitable for parsing and generation within an NL processing system.
