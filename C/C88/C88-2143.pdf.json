Reduction rules","A specific categorial grammar is characterized I~ the choice of basic c~be/jories and oennectives on the one hand, ~%d (m the set of reductic~ rules (xl %ks other. The system of reduction rules says how categories c~t be ccm~/J~ed to form larger o0nstih~ents. The application rule which cxlabines a funct~r with domain X \"and rark3e Y with a suitable a~tm~nt of category X %0 give a Y, is only one of the possible reduction rules. I,%stead of t~{ing a set of reduction laws as pr~tltive axioms, we will investigate the categorial re,orion 8yst~n as a calculus, whare the reduction laws can be ccnsidered theore~u~ that follow from a set of axioms and a set of inference rules. Next we will see that the parsip~, of a syntagm is really the same thing, in ot/~r words, attempting a pz%9of for a theorem. Sequents Before we define the axioms and inference rules of the calculus, we need %o define the r~3tion of sequant 6 . A sequent is a pair (G,D) of finite (possibly [~ ..... B.] of categories. For categorial L-sequents, we require G to be non-e~ioty and n=l. For the sequent (G,D) we write G => D. The sequence G is called the antecedent, D the suocedent. For simplicity square brackets and ccmma's are often left out. Axloms and Ja~ference rules (I) ~ ~ of L are sequ~ts of t~ fo~n X => X. (2) Inference rules of L: X, Y and Z are categories, B, T, Q, u, V are sequences of categories, where P, T and Q are ,%on-eai0ty. 695 [/R] T => Y/X if T,Y => X [\\R] T => Y~X if Y,T => X E/L] U,Y/X,%V => Z ifW =>V","and U,X,V => Z [\\I.] U,T,Y~X,V => Z if T => Y","~d U,X,V => Z [*L] U, XeY,V => Z if U,X,Y,V => Z [*R] P,Q => X*~f if P => X 8nd Q => Y ~jether, c~nic~ns and inferenc~ rules define tl~ theorems of a categorial calc~ll~-~0 Suppose we have a sequent S, to fi~ out w~ther it is a t~)r£~n or not we have to apply several, of f/~e infe~e rules above till hog]ring but axi(~ ~anain.

Much of the work described here is based on research by Michael M0ortgat. See e.g. his (1987a, 1987b, 1988). 2. e.g. Wittenburg (1987), Steedman (1987). 3.

This c~%ation is called applicaticn. 5. Notice that we will use the (argu~nt connective result) r~>taticn, no n~\" wt~t ~e directionality of the functor. 6. We wili present the sequent calculus, which Lambek adapted from Gentzen's work on logic. See Lambek (1958). 7.
