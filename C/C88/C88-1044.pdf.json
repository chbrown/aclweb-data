We examine a broad range of texts to show how the distribution of demonstrative forms and functions is genre dependent. This research is part of a larger study of anaphoric expressions, the results of which will be incorporated into a natural language generation system. 1. INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this paper is to present a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressions in English, based on a corpus of naturally occurring discourse from a variety of spoken and written genres. We propose a comprehensive set of constraints on demonstrative use and suggest how they can be incorporated into a computational processing model which integrates the local centering and global focusing aspects of discourse structure. Finally we show how our proposed algorithm for demonstratives can account for stressed pronouns as well.","Existing computational work on demonstratives has been based on examples from only three genres: experimentallyelicited apartment descriptions (Linde 1979), technical dialogues (Reichman-Adar 1984), and scientific textbooks (Sidner 1983). Testing computational algorithms against multiple genres of natural discourse is important, especially given the universal scope of current frameworks (cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986). We have chosen to systematically examine texts from a broad range of genres, which vary in spoken versus written medium, number of participants, degree of pre-planning, and formality of situation. These genres include informal conversation, partiallyspontaneous televised discussion, newspaper articles, and planning and technical documents. 2. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Demonstratives have generally been considered to be one type of deictic expression. Most of the linguistic literature on deixis has concentrated on classifying deictic expressions according to various parameters such as the linguistic or extralinguistic status of the referent. For example, Buhler (1982) distinguishes between demonstratio ad oculos, anaphora, and deixis at phantasma, whose intended referents are respectively found in the extralinguistic context, the linguistic context, or in memory or imagination. Similarly, Fillmore (1975) distinguishes gestural, anaphorie and symbolic uses of deictic expressions; and Lakoff (1974) distinguishes spatio-temporal, discourse, and emotional deixis. Such distinctions have been useful as a basis for descriptive classification of various uses of demonstrative expressions, but we do not feel that they are relevant for an explanatory account of demonstrative function and so shall not elaborate further on them here. For the same reason we also will not discuss attempts to show that discourse deixis and/or anaphora is derived • from or less prototypical than spatio4emporal deixis (of., Lyons 1977; Fillmore 1982). Our account is more compatible with the *The work presented here was partially supported under Control Data Corporation Grant #86M102 and a grant from the University of Minnesota Graduate School (Jeanette Gundel, Larry Hutchinson and Michael Kac, Principal Investigators).

It is this view which most closely","reflects the assumptions underlying computationaUy explicit","models of focus-constrained discourse processing (e.g., Linde","1979; Reichman 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986). We turn now to a presentation of specific claims about","demonstratives which have been made in the literature.","Focus shift.","a. That but not it may be used to refer to an item no longer in focus (Linde 1979). That marks the end of a discourse section (Reichman 1984, 1985). This but not that signals focus movement, except when this occurs in the scope of a quantifier or when its head noun is not identical to the head noun of an existing immediate focus (Sidner 1983).","b.

Only that may be used to comment upon the remarks of another speaker (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Lakoff 1974; Sidner 1983).","d. The interval denoted by a determiner this used with a time expression includes the speech time. (Fillmore 1975).

CONSTRAINTS ON DEMONSTRATIVE USE The basic concepts which we take to be crUcial for any adequate description of demonstxatives are ones which are central to a theory of reference in general. These are concepts such as topic, focus and various types of givenness. Since these concepts concern the cognitive status of a referent, definitions have often been iough and iatuitive, bv.:dcatiy con'ect but ~tot sufflcieLitly precise for eonlput~;ikmal iulplcmctmttion. On the oilier hand, because of the conlpledty of these concepts, attempts to ihrnish ntore precise opcrallonal definitions, e.g. on the basis of surlhce line.'n of dcr or gLm,L matical rclatiot~s~ have failed to capture lhcir cognitive basis. 'lh(; ccsult has heel, a icrminological and conceptual cort-Nsion ill tl~C literature which has led computational linguists to create nc.w t:onsh;ucts such as fc)cns arid center, in some cases without rcl:tting tllc;m to similar linguistic concepts (Itajicov:t 1987 is an, ltablc exception). Our aim hcrc is t-L characterize as p~vcisely as possible what the relevant concepts for deruouslraiives arc :.hid how they relate to one anoihcr. In a later section wc will attcnlpt tl~ show how they Lelate to more operational constructs prop 3sed in the, computational literature. Defiuit~.'ne~So As has often been pointed out, the basic notion which dctcrntines ~q)prol)riateness of a given rcfi.:rential cxpres. sion is the; status of the refcrc,t of lhat expression vis.a-vis a cognitive. :;tale of the addressee (cf. Chafe 19'/6). hi the weakest c~\\:;t:, the SFeakcr c:~[Lt:~.is the itddtcssee to uffdcrstand what type of eniily is beittg described, but not to uniquely identify the entity in q/,cslion. Such c,~ities arc typically reiEl'cnccd with indefinite itotni pbra!;cs The nlost basic distinction in demonstrative [tntciion i~; between tile indefinite use of lhe determiner 1his, as ~:xemplified in (t) and all other uses of hoth determiner and prouomiflal denlonstratives, which arc definite. As has bccll pointed ot,~ by a number of researchers, indcfinite this occurs only in cat;~,al, n,@a,ncd discouLsc. Tilts obscrvalion was con-. firmed hy our own study, which found instances of indefinite this ot,ly in the inhlrmal coaversalkms.","(1) i couldn't sleep last night. My neighbors have this","dog that kept me awake.","We will be primarily concerned hete with definite noun phrases, where the speaker expects the addressee to uniquely identify the mlin'cnt on tile basis of the description in question. Th,e rcfe,e~lts of such expressions have often been characterized as 'given'. tlowevcr, as pointed out by Gundcl (1978a, 1978b) and l'rince (1981h), givcnness is not a mfitary concept. There arc diil'ereat senses of givenness each of which is relevant to the Rn'm of reicc,'ittg expr,-ssions, but in different ways. hletttiliabitity. In the weakest sense of givcnness, the slmaker expects the addressee to uniquely identify the referent, but the basis for th: identification is iiTelevant. Not only can it be linguistic or extralingttistic, based on entities in immediate or long term memory, but it need not he based on any previous shared experience ;:it all (cf. lIawkins 1978). The basis/'or the identification may be enc~led in lhe form itselt, as in (2).","(2) I couldn't sleep last night. The neigltboes dog","kept me awake. This type of givenness, which we rctisr to as identitiability, is both necessary and Slffficient tot the use of deliniie articles. Shared t'alailiarity. Most identifiable entities are identifiable because of some shared experience between speaker and aft. dressec; again this may be linguistic or exlralinguistic, based on local colRext or hmg term menuLly associated with shared cultural or personal expt:rienct:. It is tiffs slattls which we claint is necessary for the use of demonstrative expressions (with the exception of indcfinit,~ this ). Thus, (3) unlike (2), is li:licitous only if the addressee has prior knowledge of the dog in question.","(3) I couldn't sleep last night. That dog next door","kept me awake. ActilzatioJii. Entities which are fantiliar on the basis of presence in the imnlcdiate discourse context (either linguistic or extralingnistic) are not only shared but 'in awareness.' This sense of pjvcmless, which wc reler to as 'activated,' (of. Chafe 1976, Gundel 1978b, Haji~fov;i and Vrbovfi 1982) is necessary tor pronominal reference, including pronominal demonstratives.

Activation is also a necessary condition for determiner this. Demonstcative this, both pronominal and definite determiner, has the additional condition that it not only be activated but speaker-activated, either linguistically or extralinguistically by virtue of its inclusion in the speakers context space, as in (5):","(5) A: Have you seen the neighbors new dog?","B: Yes, and that dog kept me awake all night.","B': ??Yes, and this dog kept me awake all night. [r~ focus. Finally, the most highly activated entities are not only in the speaker's arid ltearer's awareness but are the center of attention at ;t particular point in the discourse. We refer to this status as 'in focus.' Entities in .focus 1 always include at least the topic of the sentence as well as any higher level discourse topics which may not be overtly represented in the sentence itself. Under certain conditions, they may also include other elements such as the reference of the linguistic focus. Thus a shift in focus always entails a shift in topic but not vice versa. The status 'in to-otis' is a necessary condition for unstressed pronomlnals and also for zero anaphora (cf. Gundel 1978b).","The rehtlionship between tile various (definite) referential statuses and the forms that colTelate with them is shown in (6).

Focus Shift. Observations regarding the focus shift functiou of demonstratives follow naturally from the theory outlined above given two additional, but uncontroversial assumptions -- that pronominal it is necessarily unstressed and that the overwhelming majority of definite noun phrases are not only uniquely identifiahle, but shared. As noted above, the prinlary distinction between demonstrative pronouns and unstressed personal pronouns is that the referents of the latter must not only be activated, but in focus. A pronominal whose referent is not currently in focus is necessarily stressed (cf. Hirschbcrg and Pierrehumbert 1986). Since it is necessarily nnstressed, the only third person singular neuter pronominals available for focus shift are the demonstratives that and this. This accounts for the distribution of that versus it noted by Linde (1979) as well as the uses of that noted by Reichman. Use of that in referring to previous statements (also noted by both these authors) is just a special case of focus shift, since the focus of attention at the point \"after a statement is made is typically not the statement itself. However, our data does not support Sidner's (1983) claim that this but not that is used for focus movement. Exatnplcs illustrating the focus shift function of pronominal this and that include the following:","(7) K i: And..So what he DID was ...came in, set up the","free...","2: and then he nlade wassail, with rum in it'?","3: And..made it in coffee cans and heated it on the","stove in the graduate lounge.","A 4: Oh, gee.","K 5: And this was the solstice tree. lu (7), tile topic and hence the focus of attention in K5 is the tree, which is activated by its mention in K1 thus licensing tile lThere is some confusion in tile literature resulting from the fact that tile term 'focus' has been used in two distinct and at least partly opposite ways (cf Ilaji~.bv~ 1987). We use 'in focus' to refer to tile psychological notion of focus of attention (tlaji~ovgs focUSAl) and 'linguistic focus' to lefer to tile point of linguistic prominence in tim sentence (the comment). 2117 use of a pronominal. However, since it is not in focus in K2, K3, and A4, the reference to it in K5 constitutes a focus shift and thus requires a slxessed demonstrative form. Note that since the tree was speaker activated, either this or that could be used.","(8) N 1: I like the poor dog who was buried six times in","one day!","K 2: Oh. That must, that must be a story that comes","from the Second Minnesota history,","3: because that didn't appear in the, in the ah di-","ary,","4: so it must have come from somewhere,","In (8), the topic and hence focus of K2 is the story. Since the story is activated but not in focus in N1 (the focus of attention in N1 is stories that N likes), reference to the story in K2 constitutes a focus shift and thus requires a stressed demonstrative. Note that the story continues to be topic (in focus) in K3 and K4 and that in K3, an unstressed pronominal it could have been used instead of that.","(9) N 1: \"Bob loves Mary\",","2: and someone else wrote \"Mary loves Jim\"","3: and I wrote \"Jim loves Bob\"! (laughter)","4: It was three different handwritings, three differ-","ent people.","K 5: Yeah, that's good. (9) illustrates the use of that to refer to a previous statement or utterance. Since that refers to the topic of K5, the story activated in N1-4 (but not in focus), use of that constitutes a focus shift.","The focus shift function of determiner that (cf. Reichman 1984) can be explained as a consequence of Grice's maxim of quantity, specifically don't be more informative than necessary (cf. Grice, 1975). Since the overwhelming majority of definite noun phrases refer to entities that are shared, use of a demonstrative determiner as opposed to the less restrictive definite article in most instances carries little additional information. Thus a demonstrative determiner is generally used only when the signalling of shared familiarity has some additional communicative function. This is the case when there is a shift in focus, as in (10) and (11), since a focus shift always entails a shift in topic and topics are necessarily shared (cf. Gundel 1985).","In the particular case of (10), there is not enough information encoded in the noun phrase itself to allow the addressee to uniquely identify the referent. Thus a demonstrative (as opposed to a definite article) is required in order to link the referent up with entities shared as a result of immediate discourse context. In (1 lb) on the other hand, the demonstrative functions simply to signal a focus shift and therefore a definite article would be equally appropriate.","(10) a.

He showed that he could","speak every word off of his teleprompter, even the","long ones. But the speech doesn't have any chance","of putting the scandal behind him, because the","scandal is not about mistakes, as he said, and it's","not about mismanagement, as the Tower Commis-","sion said.

These incredibly small magnetic bubbles are the","vanguard of a new generation of ultradense mem-","ory-storage systems.","b. These systems are extremely rugged:","c. they are resistant to radiation and are nonvolatile. Contrast. The contrastive function of demonstratives, like the focus shift function, is related to the fact that contrast is marked by stress and pronominal it cannot carry stress. Moreover, contrast may be just a special case of focus shift, since a eontrastive noun phrase always brings into focus other entities with which it is being contrasted, as illustrated in (12):","(12) a. In both cycle steal mode and DPC, the attachmeni feature...responds with a condition code. b. For commands that do not require interrupts (that is, commands executed under DPC), the eonditi~m code provides current device status information. c. For commands that require executiou in cycle steal mode followed by an inten'upt request, this first condition code provides information concerning acceptance of the command by the attachment feature. d. Upon interrupt servicing by the processor, the at tachment feature provides a second condition code and an interrupt word.","Thus, the referent of thisfirst condition code in (12c) is already","in focus since it is also the topic of (12b). However, ,,dnce the","use of this noun phrase brings into tbcus contrasting condition","codes (cf. a second condition code in (12d)) it is not only","contrastive, but constitutes an implicit focus shift as well Proximity. The speaker-activated condition on this predicts correctly that both this and that can comment upon a speaker's own prior remark as in examples (7) and (10) respectively, but only that can be used to comment upon the remarks of another speaker, as illustrated by example (9).","The same condition also explains why this is used for extralinguistic objects relatively close to the speaker and that for those relatively further away as in (13), and why the interval de ~ noted by determiner this includes speech time, while that tends to be associated with some time prior to speech time as in (14) This is so because speaker-activated means not only linguistically activated but activated within the speaker's context space.","(13) N: This tastes like water. This tastes like THAT!","Waita minute--the stuff that's $1.99 for two quarts","hastes a- the same as one that's $2.07 for a fifth.","(14) K: There he was that hairy hound from Buo","dapest/Never leaving us alone./Never have I ever","known/a ruder pest Special Effects. As seen in the diagram in (6), each of the referential statuses is also correlated as a necessary condition for a different type of definite reference. Since the statuses are implicationally related, reference with a particular form will generally imply appropriateness of reference with all forms associated with a status higher on the hierarchy, but not vice-versa. Thus, pronominal that in (13) may be replaced with that wine and these systems in (llb) can be replaced with the systems. However, not all cases of the N are replaceable with that N, as illustrated in (2) and (3); and not all cases of that N are replaceable with that., as illustrated in (3) and (4).","The maxim of quantity would dictate that speakers will use the strongest possible form, i.e. will signal the most information as is relevant regarding the givenness status of the entity in question. The same maxim predicts that speakers would not use a stronger form than necessary in a given situation, i.e. they will not signal more information than is appropriate. Violation in either direction will often result in a special effect or implicature, as in (15), where the use of this as opposed to the equally appropriate the conveys an effect of solidarity:","(15) Gov.

[McLaughlin, 3/20/871","We already noted that use of a demonstrative determiner often has a special effect, such as signalling a topic shift, because virtually all definite NPs are also shared, and thus demonstrative determiners do not normally convey much more infommtion than would be conveyed by the definite article. Similarly, in cases where the referent is not activated, determiner that acts as an ove~ signal to the addressee to search long term memoxy for the referent, as in (16): 218","(16) A: Yet* can get those little magic fi~ger jnbbies ihat tell you when ~o water ~t.

One would expect such signals to be most common in interactions between individuals with shm'ed personal experiences, so it is not smprising that they would occur fi'equently in castml conversations between family menlbers. Typically such phrases include a relative clause specifying additional information to aid in the search and are often embedded in a request for confirmation that the referent gas indeed been located.. Since the referent is shared but not activated, it frequently occurs in left-dislocated constructions which have tile lunction of introducing or reintroducing a topic into the discourse.

The televised discussions are distinguished from the casual conversations by the frequent use of this to refer to non-speaker activated entities. Such uses contradict our claim that this\" must be speaker-activated. To account for such examples, we suggest that a distinction be made between inclusive and exclusive speaker space, in the case of local discourse segments, speaker space often excludes the addressee, but with higher-level discourse topics, which are often shm'ed, speaker space includes the addressee. In such cases, which are characteristic of highly sl'uctured interactions, this' may be used for something which was not initially activated by the speaker. In (20), reference is made to the explicit discourse topic of' tlm segment, Gorbachev's decision not to cancel the smnnfit: 1The categories Same Speaker and Other Speaker include only referents which are locally activated in the immediately preceding utterance. Thus, they ate rnutually exclusive with the category of discourse topic. 219","(20) G: The business of trying to play Kremlinologist on","this decision, I think it's simpler than that.

Although speakers generally use the strongest possible form of referring expression, here a weaker form is being used for a special reason, namely to introduce new information in the noun part.","(22) Nearly lost in the polemic was Judge Kennedy","himself.

This section outlines components of a natural language system that would capture the relevant notions of shared familiarity, activation and form; and explores possibilities for incorporating these into current dis~. course-processing algorithms. 1 Shared familiarity. At minimum, a computational rrtodel of shared familiarity requires maintenance of a user discourse his-. tory in which a record is maintained of all entities referenced in conversations with a particular user. Thus, for any entity in its knowledge base, the natural language system knows whether/bat entity has been discussed before (shared familiarity) or not (familiarity unknown). Only in the former case can a definite demonstrative expression be used. The recognition of discourse units (e.g. speech acts of Allen 1983) and the aelations between them, e.g. conversational moves (Reichman 1985), rhetorical predicates (McKeown 1985, Mann and Thompson 1986) are also important in demonstrative resolution. These require a so-phisticated user model which keeps a record of beliefs and intentions of discourse participants. While such a model could be incorporated into existing discourse structure frameworks (e.g. Grosz and Sidner 1986), no specific proposals to account for shared familiarity have yet been advanced (but see Sparck Jones 1986). Activation. An adequate model of activation must isolate that subset of shared entities which is activated at any given point in the discourse. This subset includes entities referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, entities present in the immediate spatio-temporal context of the discourse, and beliefs and intentions relevant to the cmTent discourse segment. Many currem discourse algorithms which function at the local level of discourse structure can be used to model activation due to the immediately preceding sentence. For example, Haji~ov~i (1987) points oat that elements in McKeown's (1985) potential focus list can be equated with activated elements. Similarly, in the current centering paradigm (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein 1986, Brennan, Friedman and Pollard 1987) elements in the set of forward looking centers can also be considered activated. At the global level, Sidner and Grosz (1986) describe a model of discourse structure which indicates currently activated beliefs and intentions at any • given point in a discourse. In Focus. Elements in focus are those which are most highly activated. 2 These always include at least the topic of the sentence, any high-level topics (including those not overtly represented in the sentence), and under certain as yet poorly under-stood conditions, the referent of the linguistic focus. In the cut'-. rent centering paradigm, the topic of the sentence is equated to the backward looking center (ef. Joshi and Weinstein 1981). In this l Kryk (1987) presents an algorithur for demo~lstrative interpretation in Polish and English based on Sidner's 1983 algorithms. Kryk's algorithm, bowever, does not appear to be explicit enough to serve as a basis for implementation. Moreover, some of the algorithm's predictions, for example that the demonstrative that is never used fbr non-copresent extralinguistic reference whereas non-copresent this is u,':ed only for exla'alinguistic reference, are inaccurate. 2Although our notion of activation is similar to Haji~ovlt (1987), it differs in that she considers the linguistic f~us to be more highly activated tha~t the topic. We feel that our assumptions about tiegrces of activation me more compatible wifli the fact, noted also by llaji~\"ovfi, that topic maintains iir~ activation longer than does the referents of the linguistic focus. '2 2 O paradigm nns~essed pronouns are viewed as preferring an existing bacl~wards-lookhlg center as antecedent. We have suggested that use of a demonstrative expression or stressed pronoun signals that the option to shift the backwards-looking center has been selected over the otherwise-preferred option of continuing an existing backwards-looking center. Brennan, Friedman and Pollard (1987), in fact, mention in passing that stressed pronouns in oral discourse could be used to unambiguously signal one such type of cer~ter shift. (cf. Sgall (1984), who remarks that demonstratives c~Jn be used to unambiguously specify reference to the linguistic fi ~cus of the irmnediately preceding sentence.) Genre differences. A final application of our constraints is in the atea of discourse genre variation. We have shown that both the form and function of demonstrative expressions varies between diffi;rent spoken and written discourse genres. Our final suggestion is that these and other genre differences should be further explored, so that it will eventually be possible to design maximally-efficient discourse-processing algorithms which differentially e, xploit such genre distinctions. 7o REFERENCES","Allen, James. 1983.
