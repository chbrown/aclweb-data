This oErresponOs to a hierarchical view: the utterance is decomposed into groups and subgroups. When the depth of lmguiscic analys~s is suc~ that a representation m terms of graphs, networks or sets of formulas would l)e more Jirect, one often st i ] I prefers to use tree structures, at the price of encoding the desired informa::ion in the decorations (e g., by \"ooindexing\" two or more nodes). This is because trees are conceptual]y and a]gorithmical]y eas~er to manipu]ate, and also because all usua] interpretations based on the linguistic structure are more or less \"compositiona]\" in nature.","If a language is described by a classical Phrase Structure Grammar, or by a (projective) Dependency Grammar, the tree structure \"contains\" the associated string in some easily defined sense. ]n particular, the surface order of tile string is derived from some ordered traverse1 of the tree (left--to-right order of the leaves of a constituent tree, or infix order' foe a dependency tree).","However, if one wants to associate \"natural\" structures to strings, for examole abstract trees for programs or predicate-argument structures for NL utterances, this is no longer true. Elements of the string may have been erased, or duplicated, some \"discontinuous\" groups may have been put together, and the surface order may not be reflected in the tree (e.g., for' e normalized representation). Such correspondences must be compositional: the complete tree corresponds to the complete string, thee subtrees correspond to suPstrings, etc. Hence, we call them \"Structured String-tree Correspondences\" (SSTC).","For some applications, like classical (batch) Machine Translation (MT), it is not necessary to Keep the correspondence explicit: 'For revising a translation, it is enough to show the correspondence between two sentences or two paragraphs. 14owever, if one wants to build structured editors for texts written tn natural language, thereby using at the same time a string (the text) and a tree (its representation), it seems necessary to represent explicitly the associated SSTC.","In the first part, we briefly review the types of string-tree correspondences whloh are implied by the most usual types of tree representations of NL utterances. We argue that a SSTC should in fact be composed of two interrelated correspondences, one between nodes and substrings, and the other between subtrees and substrings, the substrings being possibly discontinous m both cases. This is presented in more detail in the second part. ]n the last part, we show how to define a SSTC with a Structural Correspondence Static Grammar (SCSG), and which constraints to put on the rules of the SCSG to get a \"natural\" SSTC. [. ~CRR~N~..E,_j~TWEEN A STRIN~ 1. p~F~E ~TRUCTURE TREES (C-STRUCTURESI","Classical Phrase Structure trees give rise to a very simple Kind of SSTC. To each string w = al...an, let us associate the set of interva]s i j, O~i~j~n. w(i j} denotes the substring ai...a3 of w if i<o, 6 otherwise.","The root, or equtva]ently the M]o]e tree, corresponds to w = wl0n). Each ]ear corresponds to some substring w(i j), of length 0 or 1 (we may extend this to any lengtm if terminals are allowed to be themselves Strings Then, the correspondence is such that any internal node of the tree, or equivalently each tree \"complete\" m breadth and depth, COrrespondS tO w(i.j), iff its m daughters (or' its m immediate subtrees), in order', correspond to a sequence w{iL_jl),...,w(im gm], such that i1=i, jm=j, and jk=ik*l for O<k<m.","This type of correspondence is \"prooectwe\" It has however Peer] argued that classical phrase structure trees are maaequate for\" charaoterising syntactic representations in genera], especially in the ease of so-oat]ed \"discontinuous\"constttuents.

Sentence (2) contains the particle \"up\", whtoh ls separated from its verb \"picKed\" by \"the ball\", In sentence (3), the discontinuous negation \"ne..,pas\" overlaps with the composed form of the verb \"ai...donn~\". Moreover, i{ a sentence in active voice ls to be represented in a standard order (subject verb object complement), this sentence contains two displaced elements, namely the object \"le\" and the complement \"lui\".","(McCawley 82) and later (Bunt & al 87} have argued that \"meaningful\" representations of sentences (2) and (3) should be the following phrase structure trees, (4) and (5), respectively. 59 + ....................................................... +","S (4) S (5) ! ! !

But an internal node with m daughters corresponds to a sequence of intervals, ~hich' is the \"union\" of the m sequences corresponding to Its daughters.","More precisely, a \"sequence\" of Intervals is a llst of the form S = w{il_jl) ..... wlip_jp}, in order (Ik<Ik+1 for O<K<p) and without overlapping (jk<ik+1 for O<k<p). Its union (denoted by \"+\") with an interval I = w(i j} is the smallest list containing all elements of S and of I.

DEPENDENCY TREES (F~S~RUCTUR~)","In classical dependency trees, elements of the represented string appear on the nodes of the tree, with no auxiliary symbols, except a \"dummy node\", often indicated by \"=\", which serves to separate the left daughters from the right daughters.","There are two aspects in the correspondence. First, a node corresponds to an element of the string, usually an interval of length 1. Second, the complete subtree rooted at a node corresponds to the tnterval union of the intervals corresponding tO the node and to Its subtree. These intervals may not overlap.","The string can be produced from the tree by an tnorder traversal (one starts from the root, and, at any node, one traverses ftrst the trees rooted at the left daughters, then the node, then the trees rooted at the right daughters, reeursively).","Sentences (1) and (2) might be represented by trees (8) and (9) below. + ......................................................... ÷ ! talked (8) picked (9) ! ! !

AS seen in other examples above, the nodes ~¢nich refer directly to the string do not contatn elements of the string, but rather representatives of (sequences of) elements of the string, called \"lexical units\" (LU), like \"repair\" for \"reparation\", plus some information about the derivation used.","The graph is deduced by simple rules from a dependency tree: each tnternat node t8 \"lowered\" tn the \"'\" position and its syntactic function becomes \"GOV\" (for \"governor\", or head in some other terminology), discontinuous lexical elements (like \"ne...pas\" or \"al...denn~\" are represented by one node, coordination ts represented by \"vertical ltsts\" as tn tree (14), lextoal units of referred element~ are put In the nodes corresponding to the pronouns, an approximation of colndexlng, etc..","From the point of view of the associated correspondence between representation trees and represented 8trtngs, nothing new has to be mentioned. II. A PROPOSAL: STRUCTURED STRING-TREE CORRESPONDENCES Our proposal Is now almost complete. I. DEFINITIONS","a) The correspOndence between a string and its representation tree ts made of two interrelated correspondences: between nodes and (possibly discontinuous) 8ubstrings; between (possibly Incomplete) subtrees and (possibly dtsconttnous) substrlngs. gl","b) It can be encoded on the tree by attaching to each node N two sequences of intervals, called SNODE(N) and SIREE(N), such that:","1. SNODE(N) ~ STREE(N), v~ich means that SNODE(N) 18 \"contained\" tm STREE(N) with respect to tts basic elements (the w(i j}), that is, that StREE(N) = STREE(N) g SNODE(N). Note that equality can not be required, even on the leaves, because the string \"( b )\" may well have a representation tree with the unique nede b.","2. if N has m daughters Nt...Nm, then STREE(N) ~ STREE(N1)+...+STREE(Nm) + SNODE(N). ]n case of strict containment, the difference correspond to the elements of the string which are represented by the subtree but which are not explicitly represented, like \"(l' and \")\" in \"( b )\".","c) The sequence SSUBT(X,N) corresponding to a given mcomplete subtree X rooted at node N of the whole tree T is defined recursively by: SSUB1(X,N) : STREE(X) if X : N, that is, if × iS reduced to one node, not necessarily a leaf of T; SSUBT(X,N) = SSUBT(XI)*..I+SSUBT(XD) U SNODE(N). if N, the root of X, has p subtrees XI...XD in T.","In other words, one takes the smallest sequence contaming the bi9gest sequence corresponding to the leaves of x (S]REE on the leaves) and compatible with the monotony rules above.","Here are some interesting properties of SSTCs which may help to classify them. A SSTC iS ~ if STREE(NI) and STREE(N2) have an empty intersection If N1 and N2 are independent; SNODE(N1) and STREE(N2) have an empty intersection if N2 is a daughter of NI. A SSTC is eB_~~eta~_t&~ if it is non-overlapping; for any two sister nodes N1 and N2, N1 to the left of N2, STREE(N1) is completely to the left of STREE(N2). This means that, if STREE(N1) = w(il_jl},..w(ip_jp) or and STREE(N2) = w(kl_ll}...w(kqlq} or ~, then jp~kl.","A SSTC is irg_LE~[ if. for each elementary interval w(i_i-1), there is a node N such that SNODE(N) = w{i i+1).","A SSTC is gQEP_Lg_C~ if each elementary interval Is contained in SNODE(N) for some node N.","A SSTC is of the g~ if SNODE(N) is empty for each non terminal node N. 3. ~_R~PRE~SNTATION","In the examples above, we have encoded the correspondence in the tree. However, this is in practice not always necessary, or even practical.","in the case of explicit and projective SSTCs, for instance, the string can De obtained directly from the tree, and there is no need to show the intervals,","Note that, in the process of generating a string from a tree, one naturally starts from the top, not knowing the final length of the string, and goes down recurs ]rely, dividing this i nt erv~a ] into smaller intervals. Rather than to introduce variables representing the extremities of the created intervals, it may be more practical to start from a fixed interval, say 0_1 or 0 lO0. Yhen. the Positions between the elements of G2 the string will be denoted by am increasing sequence of rational numbers (0, 1/3, 1/2, 5/?), etc.","In the case of \"local\" non-projectivtty, we have tried some devices using two relative integers (POS,LEV) associated with each node N. POS(N) st~ws the relative order in the subtree rooted at mother(N), if LEV(N)=O, or more generally at tts LEV(N÷I) ancestor, if t.EV(N)>O. Unfortunately, all these schemes seem to work only for particular situations.","Also, if the SSTC is overlapping, or' not complete, 1( may be computationally costly fo find the (sma]lest) subtree associated with a given (possib]y discontinuous) substrtng. But this operation would be essential in a \"structural\" editor of NL texts. A possibility is then to encode the correspondence both in the tree and in the string.","Finally, take the example of tree (15) above. Suppose that the user of a NL editor wants to cllange bl (Paul, in the corresponding NL example) in a way v~Hch may contradict some agreement constraint between al, v, bl and el. One should be able to ftmd the smallest SSIC containing al and other elements, that is, the subtr'ee V(al,bl,cl) and the discontinuous substring al v bl cl (the notation a..v.b..c., might be suitable, if one wants to avoid indices).","For these reasons, it may be werth~qile to COnSider the possibility of representing the $gTC independently of beth the tree and the string. This is actually the ldea behind the formalism of gTCG (String-Tree Correspondence Grammar).","The static grammars of (Vauquols & Chappuy 85) are devices to define string-tree correspondences. They have been formalized by the STCGs of (Zahartn 86).","Here, a context-free ltke apparatus of rules (also called \"boards\", for \"planches\" in French, because they are usually written with two~dtmenslonal tree diagrah~s) is used to construct the set of \"legal\" SSYCs.","The axioms are all pairs (X,Y($F)), where X is an unbounded string variable, Y a starting node (standing for SENTENCE, or TITLE, for example), and SF is an unbounded forest variable.","The terminals are all pairs (x,x'), where x is an element of a strtng and x' a one-node tree vZ~ich represents it.","The rules chow how a SSTC t8 made up of smaller' ones. ]he generated language ts the set of all variable-free (<strlng>,<tree>) pairs derivable from an axiom by the grammar rules.","In order to avoid undue formalism, let us give an example for the formal language (an bn cn I n>O).

However, there have been arguments saying that they are not adequate for representing the so-called 'discontinuous' structures. This has led to various solutions, relying, for instance, on encoding the desired information in the nodes (e.g."]},{"title":"'eoindexin9\"),","paragraphs":["or on oefining trees with \"discontinuous\" const i tuents.","We have presented here a proposal for representing discont inuous constituents, and, more generally, non-projective and uncomplete SSTCs with overlapping.","The proposal uses the ordinary definition of ordered trees. This is made possible by separating the representation tree from the surface utterance (which the tree is a representation of). The correspondence between the two may be represented explicitly by means cf sequences of intervals attached to the nodes.","This opens Up a discussion on (and definitions of) structured string-tree correspondences in general. Thls representation might also be used in syntactic editors for programs or In syntact~co-semanttc editors for NL texts. 64","Finally, the formalism of the String-Tree Correspondence 6rammar has been extended to glve the means of representing the said structured correspondences.","An analogous problem is to define structured correspondences between representation trees, for lnstanoe between source and target interface structures in transfer-based MT systems. We do not yet know of any satisfactory proposal.","A solution to this problem would give two very Interesting results: - first, a way to specify structural transfers in a reasoned manner, just as STCGs are used to specify","structural analysers or generators, second, a way to put a text and its translation in a very fine-grained correspondence. This is quite easy with word-for-word approaches, of course, and also for approaches using classical (projective) PS trees or dependency trees, but has become qutte difficult with more sophisticated approaches using p-structures or m-structures.","{Bunt & a] 87) H.BUNT, J.THESINGH & K.
