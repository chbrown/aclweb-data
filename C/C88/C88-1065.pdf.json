START is able to interpret correctly a wide range of semantic relationships associated with alternate expressions of the arguments of verbs. The design of the system takes advantage of the results of recent linguistic research into the structure of the lexicon, allowing START to attain a broader range of coverage than many existing systems while maintaining modular organization. 1. Introduction If asked \"Did Sally eat?\" after having been told that Sally ate a pear, speakers of English would not hesitate to answer \"Yes\". But we would not expect English speakers to answer \"Yes\" if asked \"Did David dress?\" after being told that David dressed the baby. Here the appropriate answer would be \"I don't know\".","Computational linguists engaged in building Question-Answering systems should find these examples thought-provoking. Two sequences consisting of a statement followed by a question which appear to be parallel syntactically (transitive use of a verb in the statement, intransitive use of the same verb in the question) elicit quite different responses. The simple syntax of these pairs is unlikely to pose a challenge for the parsers used in most existing systems. The problem is that the intransitive uses of the two verbs, eat and dress, receive very different interpretations. Thus the intransitive use of eat found in the question \"Did Sally eat?\" implies the existence of an understood but unexpressed 'object that is interpreted as a prototyplcal type of food or a meal: (1) Sally ate a pear. ~ Sally ate. (i.e., Sally ate some food.) The question \"Did David dress?\" on the other hand does not mean ~Did David dress something one typically dresses?', it means 'Did David dress himself?': (2) David dressed the baby, =7~ David dressed (i.e., David","dressed himself.) Natural language systems should be able to recognize that the relationship between transitive and intransitive dress is not the same as that between transitive and intransitive eat.","A large number of English verbs have both transitive and intransitive uses. Interchanges parallel to the one described for eat are possible with a wide range of verbs: (3) Jessiea typed a letter. Did Jessica type? Yes. (4) Gabriella swept the floor. Did she sweep? Yes. (5) Miriam read the book. Did Miriam read? Yes. But the behavior of the verb dress is not exceptional. Another set of verbs including bathe, change, shave, shower, and wash behave like it. For example, these verbs show the same entailments as dress: (6) Carla bathed the dog. :=~ Carla bathed (i.e., Carla bathed","herself.) (7) Jill washed the sweater. =fi~ Jill washed (i.e., Jill washed","herself.) (8) Peter shaved Tom. ~ Peter shaved (!.e., Peter shaved","himself.)","The different relationships between transitive and intransi~ give uses of verbs cannot be ignored in the design of a natural language system and its lexical component, The most obvious way to handle these relationships is to add information to the lexical entries of each verb with transitive and intransitive uses. While such an approach is viable when a system has a smM1 lex~ icon~ it becomes less tractable as the lexicon grows larger since it requires a tremendous increase in the amount of idiosyncratic information which must be registered in the entry of ea(-h verb.","The examples discussed so far illustrate just a few of a wide range of relationships between alternate expressions of the arguments of verbs that must be correctly interpreted by any natural language system that alms at substantial coverage of English. We believe that what is required in order to imple-ment a system that meets these demands is an understanding of English lexical organization. For this reason we draw on recent theoretleal linguistic investigations into the lexical knowledge possessed by native speakers of English carried out by the MIT Lexicon Project (Rappaport, Levin, and Laughren [1988], Levin [1985], Hale and Keyser [1986], Levin and Rappaport [to appear]). These studies have established a range of semantic-syntactic interdependencies exhibited by semantically coherent classes of verbs and have identified a number of essential classes of verbs, as well as the central properties characterizing verbs of each type.","The results of this work have been used in the design of a lexical component for the START natural language system developed at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (Katz [1988]). In this paper we show how these resttlgs allow STAtt2[' to attain a broader range of coverage than most existing systems while maintaining modular organization. 316 2o Assu[nptlons about Lexicai Organization A verb d,~notes an action, state, or process involving one or more participants, which we refer to as the"]},{"title":"arguments","paragraphs":["of the verb.

(See Atkins, Keg/, and Levln [1986], Hale and Keyser It9~t6], Levin [1985] for a description of various other altern~tion.~l.) A question that a system designer might ask is whether the argument Mternations a verb participates in are predictable or whether they are merely an idiosyncratic property of that w~rt,. This question is clearly also of linguistic interest.","Argument alternations, including transitivity alternations, have receiw~d considerable attention from theoretical linguists. It tin'as out that each alternation is associated with particular semantic types of verbs. Thus the verbs participating in the indefinite object alternation ate all"]},{"title":"activity","paragraphs":["verbs; most of them describe typical occup.ations: a (11) drink, eat, file, iron, plow, read, sweep, type, write ....

The members of these classes share certai:: syntactic properties, specifically properties concerning the possible expressions of their arguments. To state this differently, certain linguistically relewnt aspects of a verb's meaning serve as a pointer to its place in the organizational scheme of English verbs. Once this place is identified, various syntactic properties of a verb can be determined.","For linguists working on the lexicon the study of alter- i nations can provide insight into linguistically relevant aspects of meaning due to the interdependency between the syntactic and semantic properties of a verb. (For instance, see Hale and Keyser [1987] for a discussion of another transitivity alternation, the"]},{"title":"middle ttlternation,","paragraphs":["from this perspective). For eompttta-tional linguists this characteristic of lexicM organization suggests a modtflar system design: many lexical properties can be associated with verb classes, and need not be registered in the lexical entries of individual verbs, which can simply indicate class rnember~hip. These ideas are incorporated into the design of tb.e START system, as we describe in detail in the remainder of the paper. 1 In certain circumstances, a much wider range of English transitive verbs show an intransitlve use with an indefinite object interpretation: when they are used by people whose activity involves the action denoted by the verb to describe the activity. For example, the verb"]},{"title":"stuff does","paragraphs":["not usually occur without an object,"]},{"title":"~She stuffs,","paragraphs":["but if this verb is used to describe the activity of someone Who stuffs pillows in a pillow-factory, then it would be M1 right to use the verb :ntransitively. 3.

The system will then produce an English response.","START has been used by researchers at MIT, Stanford University, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for constructing and querying knowledge bases using English. (See, for example, Winston [1982], [1984], Winston, Binford, Katz, and Lowry [1983], Doyle [1984], Katz and Brooks [19871).","START rearranges the elements of the parse tree it constructs into embedded"]},{"title":"ternary expressions (T-expressions)","paragraphs":["by tying together the three most salient parameters of a sentence, the subject, the object, and the relation between them, <subject relation object>.

When we index the T-expression in the knowledge base, we cross-reference its three components and attach the history H to it. One can thus think of the resulting entry in the knowledge base as a \"digested summary\" of the syntactic structure of English sentences.","In order to handle embedded sentences, START allows any T-expression to take another T-expression as its subject or ob-- jeer. START can analyze and generate sentences with arb:trarily complex embedded structures.","We conclude our description of START with a brief overview of how the system answers questions. Questions are requests for information from START's knowledge base. In order to answer a question START must translate the question into a T-expression template which can be used to search the knowledge base for T-expressions which contain infornmtion relevant to providing an answer to the question. We illustrate the actual question~ answering process with an example. Suppose that as a result of analyzing and indexing a text containing sentence (14), the knowledge base contains T-expression (15): (14) Mary presented Paul with a gift. (15) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> Now suppose that a user asks START the following wh-question: (16) Whom did Mary present with a gift? In the context of.(14) the answer is"]},{"title":"Paul.","paragraphs":["In order to determine this, the system must first turn the question into a T-expression template that can be used to search the knowledge base. The first step in this process is to undo the effects of the ~h-movement transformation that is used to create English"]},{"title":"wh-","paragraphs":["questions. To do this, START must find the place in sentence (16) that the wh-word"]},{"title":"whom","paragraphs":["came from and then insert the wh-word in this position: 317 (17) Mary presented whom with a gift. Next the language understanding system leads sentence (17) through the same flow of control as any other declarative sentence and produces the following T-expression which serves as a pattern used to query the knowledge base: (18) <<Mary present whom> with gift> Treating whom as a matching variable, the system feeds T-expression (18) through a matcher in order to determine whether there is anything in the knowledge base that matches (18). The marcher finds the T-expression created from (14): (19) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> and the language generation system then uses this T-expression to produce the English response to question (16): (20) Mary presented Paul with a gift.","START handles yes-no questions in a similar fashion. Suppose that START had been asked the yes-no question (21) Did Mary present Paul with a gift? As in the wh-case, START would turn this question into a T-expression template that could be matched against the T-expressions in the knowledge base. The difference between yea-no and wh-questions is that the T-expression template generated by a yes-no question would contain no variables. The question above would generate the template <<Mary present Paul> with gift> which would match against (19), allowing the system to answer: (22) Yes, Mary presented Paul with a gift. 4. Introducing S-rules Since T-expressions in the START system are built using the pattern <subject relation object> at every level of embedding, they mimic the hierarchical organization of English sentences. As a consequence, sentences differing in their surface syntax but close in meaning are not considered similar by the system. For example, given sentence (23) as input, START will create an embedded T-expression (24), whereas a near paraphrase, sentence (25), will generate T-expression (26): (23) Mary presented Paul with a gift (24) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> (25) Mary presented a gift to Paul (26) <<Mary present gift> to Paul> Speakers of English know that sentences (23) and (25) both describe a transfer of possession. In both sentences, the gift is the transferred object, Paul is the recipient of this object, and Mary is the agent of the transfer~ despite different syntactic realizations of some of these arguments. It seems natural that this kind of knowledge be available to a natural language system. However, START, as described so far, does not consider T-expressions (24) and (26), which are associated with these sentences, to be similar.","The difference in the T-expressions becomes particularly problematic when START is asked a question. An example will clarify this point. Suppose the input text contains only one present sentence, (27), and the knowledge base contMns only the corresponding T-expression, (28): (27) Mary presented Paul with a gift (28) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> Now suppose the user asked the following question: (29) To whom did Mary present a gift? 318 Although a speaker of English could easily answer this question after being told sentence (27), START would not be able to answer it. This question presents a problem for START because T-expression (30) produced by question (29) will not match T-expression (28). (30) <<Mary present gift> to whom>","START is unable to answer such questions because it is unaware of the interactions between the syntactic and semantic properties of verbs. This limitation is a serious drawback since interactions similar to the one just described pervade the English language and, therefore, cannot be ignored in the construction of a natural language system.","The present example illustrates that START needs information that allows it to deduce the relationship between alternate realizations of the arguments of verbs. In this instance, we want START to know that whenever A presents B with C, then A presents C to B. We do this by introducing rules that make explicit the relationship between alternate realizations of the arguments of verbs. We call such rules S~rules (where S stands for both Syntax and Semantics). Here is the S-rule that solves the problem caused by the verb present: (31) Present S-rule","If <<subject present object1> with object2>","Then <<subject present object2> to objectl> S-rules are implemented as a rule-based system. Each S-rule is made up of two parts, an antecedent (the IF-clause) and a consequent (the THEN-clause). Each clause consists of a set of templates for T-expressions, where the template elements are filled by variables or constants. For example, the Present S-rule contains three variables, subject, object1, object2, which are used to represent the noun phrases in the T-expressions. This rule also contains three constants, present, with, and to, shown in boldface. The Present S-rule will apply only to T-expressions which involve the verb present and which meet the additional structural constraints.","S-rules operate in two modes: forward and backward. We describe both modes of operation briefly, although in this paper we concentrate on S-rules operating in the backward mode, since this mode is most useful in a Question-Answering natural language system.","When triggered by certain conditions, S-rules in the forward mode allow the system to intercept T-expressions produced by the understanding module, transform or augment them in a way specified by the rule, and then incorporate the result into the knowledge base. For instance, if the Present S-rule is used in the forward mode, as soon as its antecedent matches T-expression (32) produced by the understanding module, it creates a new T-expression (33) and then adds it to the knowledge base: (32) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> (33) <<Mary present gift> to Paul> Now question (29) can be answered since T-expression (30) associated with this question matches against T-expression (33). The generating module of START responds: (34) Mary presented a gift to Paul. All additional facts produced by the forward S-rules are in-. stantly entered in the knowledge basel The forward mode is especially useful when the information processed by START is put into action by another computer system because in such a situation START ought to provide the interfacing system with as much data as possible.","In contrast, the backward mode is employed when the user queries the knowledge base. Often for reasons of computa-tional e/l~cleney, it is advantageous not to incorporate all in-ferred knowledge into the knowledge base immediately. S-rules in the bac:kward mode trigger only when a request comes in which cannot be answered directly, initiating a search in the knowledge base to determine if the answer can be deduced from the available information. For example, the"]},{"title":"Present","paragraphs":["S-rule used in the backward mode does"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["trigger when sentence (27) is read and T-expression (28) is produced by START. The S-rule triggers only when question (29) is asked since this question cannot be answered directly. 5. The I,exical Component of START In order to lmderstand an English sentence, the START system needs to have morphological, syntactic, and semantic information about the words in the sentence.

Thus the verb class approach, unlike the lexical property approach, allows a more modular system design; this in turn allows the coverage of the system to be extended more easily. 320","To illustrate that each class of verbs is characterized by a whole cluster of properties, we survey just a few of the properties associated with the emotional-reaction verbs.

Lexical Acquisition A natural language system must be built in such a way that is is easy to expande its coverage, not only by increasing the size of the lexicon but also by adding to the set of different phenomena covered by its grammar. Due to the large number of semantic-syntactic interdependencies, increasing the coverage of a system's grammar might seem to be prohibitively expensive. It would require meddling with the entries of every verb in the Lexicon, in order to register its behavior with respect to the new phenomenon. But once a phenomenon is assoeiated with one or more verb classes, it need"]},{"title":"only","paragraphs":["be associated with these classes.
