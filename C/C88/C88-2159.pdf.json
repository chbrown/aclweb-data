Topic-driven Discourse Structure is formalized which identifies mainly non-human zero pronouns as a by-product. Other zero pronouns are handled using cognitive and sociolinguistic information in honorific, deictic, speech-act and mental predicates. These are integrated into the model. 1. Introduction","An approach is proposed to automatically analyze Japanese dialogue containing zero pronouns, the most frequent type of anaphora which corresponds in fimction to personal pronouns in English. Zero pronoun is defined as an obligatory case noun phrase that is not expressed in the utterance but can be understood through other utterances in the discourse, context, or out-of-context knowledge. Gaps identifiable by syntactico-semantic means, such as those in relative clauses and a certain type of subordinate verb phrase, are excluded. The input discourse is conversation carried out in Japanese by typing at computer terminals, a type of conversation which has been proved to have the thndamental characteristics common to telephone conversation (Arita et al. 1987).","The key idea of the model is topic, something being talked about in the discourse. This notion derives from the study of theme and theme by the Prague School (Firbas 1966). In the following, it is discussed that mainly non-human zero pronouns can be identified by means of topic, and, to do so, a discourse structure on the basis of recursively appearing topics is formalized. Other zero pronouns, mainly human ones, are identified using cognitive and sociolinguistie information conveyed by honorific, deictic, and speech-act predicates as to how the omitted cases are related to the speaker or hearer. The cooccurence restriction between subject and predicate that expresses a mental activity is also utilized. Finally, the interaction among these different factors in zero pronoun identification is discussed, and a model integrating them is proposed. This is to constitute a part of a machine translation system being developed at the ATR which deals with Japanese-English telephone and inter-terminal dialogue. 2. Zero prm~oun's role in discourse","An investigation of simulated Japanese inter-terminal dialogues (94 sentences, 2 dialogue sequences) and their English t~anslation has revealed that out of 53 occurrences of personal pronouns in the English translation, 51 correspond to zero pronouns in the original Japanese text. Though the size of the data is limited, this coincides well with our intuition about Japanese zero anaphora that it performs discourse-grammatical functions including those played by personal pronouns in English (for a discussion to the same effect, see Kameyama 1985).","In the same Japanese dialogue data, out of 15 Zero pronouns coreferent with non-human antecedents, 14 refer to one of the current topics in the discourse. Out of 74 zero pronouns corresponding to the first and second persons, 55 can be identified by means of cognitive and sociolinguistic information in honorific, deictic, speech-act, and mental predicates. The other 19 examples were either set phrases for identifying the hearer, explaining one's intention, and responding, etc., or cases understandable only in terms of the total context and situation. Besides an approach based on heuristic rules, the only possible solution to these would be one with planning and/or script. I will here concentrate on the major portion of zero anaphora cases that are identifiable by topic continuity or predicate information as to honorificity, deixis, speech act, or mental activity. N.B. Unlike italian, Spanish, etc., in Japanese predicates grammatical information such as person, gender and number is not indicated morphologically. This is one of the reasons we must emphasize pragmatic and discourse-grammatical factors in retrieving information referred to by zero anaphora. 3. Topic-based identification 3.1. PSG treatment of topic and zero pronoun","The Japanese topic has the following major characteristics: (i) The topic is marked with a postposition wa and usually, but not always, preposed. (ii) More than one topic can appear in a simple sentence. (iii) With a certain type of subordinates, the subordinate predicate is controlled obligatorily by a topicalized matrix subject, but not by an untopicalized one. (iv) The topic represents what is being talked about in the discourse.","In the following an intrasentential treatment of (i) to (iii), a modified version of Yoshimoto (1987) is explained. It is based on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) by Pollard & Sag (1987) and Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar (JPSG) by Gunji (1987).","Topic is represented as a value in the TOPIC feature that corresponds to the semantics of topicalized NP(s). The TOPIC is a FOOT feature that derives from the lexical description of wa. To deal with multi-topic sentences, the value of TOPIC is a stack that enables embedding of topics. For the type of subordinate whose predicate is controlled by a topicalized matrix subject, the subordinate-head particle (to be more exact, ADV head) is given a feature specification to the effect that the subordinate subject unifies with a topicalized matrix subject, but not with an untopicalized one.","This topic description along with other parts of the"]},{"title":"779'","paragraphs":["fundamental grammar of Japanese was implemented on a unifica{ion-based parser built up by my colleagues Kiyoshi Kogure and Susumu Kat6 (Maeda et al. 1988).","The anlysis of (l-l-a) is given as (l-l-b).","(1-1-a) Sightseeingtour wa arimasu ka? sightseeing-tour TOP exist-POL QUEST is there a sightseeing tour?","(I-I-b)","[[HEAD [[POS(part-of-speech) V] [CTYPE(con jugation-type) NONC(noncenJugate)] [CFORM(conjugation-form) SENF(ssntsnce-flnsl ) ]]]","[SUBCAT {}]","[SEbl [[RELN(rslatlon) S(surface)-REQUEST] [AGEN(agent ) ?SPEAKER] [SECP(recipient) ?HEARER] [OBJE(obJect)","[[RELN INFORMIF]","[AGEN ?HEARER]","[RECP ?SPEAKER]","[OBJE [[RELN EXIST-i]","[OBJE ?TOP[[PARM(paramater) ?X]","[RESTS(restrictio.)","[[RELN SIGHISEEING_TOUR-t]","[OBJE ?X]]]]]]]]]]]","[TOPIC [[FIRST ?TOP] [REST END]]]] N.B. \"?\" is a prefix for a tag-name representing a token identity of feature structures.","Omitted obligatory case NPs, i.e. those which are specified in the lexical description of the predicate as SUBCAT values but are not found explicitly in the sentence, are represented as values in the SLASH, following HPSG and JPSG.

Following JPSG, subcategorized-for NPs are assigned to the category P (therefore, to be more exact, they are PPs), because all (at least written) Japanese case NPs are followed by postpositions. 3.2. Topic-driven discourse structure","Based on the intrasentential specification of topicalized sentences given in the previous section, a discourse-level topic structure is formalized, with zero anaphora being identified at the same time.","In (1), the zero pronoun \"W' in A1-2 coincides with sightseeing tour, a topic in QI-1. However, a naive algorithm of finding the most recent topic fails because of the topics' recursive structure: the zero indirect object in 780 Q3-1 refers to the \"higher\" topic sightseeing tour in QI-1, not the \"lower\" one hiy6 in Q2-1. (1) Q1.1: S~ghtseeingtour w_.aa arimasu ka? Is there a sightseeing tour? Aul: Hai, A1-2: ¢ arimasu.

The leaf node is a C whose TOP value is a stack with all the topics in the sentence, and each non-terminal node C has a TOP stack containing that of the immediately dominated C minus the first member.

Note that, while discourse (1) is being analyzed, zero pronou~Js in At-2, A2-1, and Q3-1 are also identified. (The other '.~ero pronoun in Q3-1, i.e. the subject of the sentence, is lef~ unspecified here. Its identification needs ~peech act cal;egorization of sentences.)","This topic-based approach is in contrast to Kameyama's ,Japanese version (Kameyama 1985, Kameyama 1986) of\" tbcus-based spproach to anaphora by Grosz et al. 1983. In her framewock, subjecthood and predicate deixis play the principal role, and the fact that topic provides the most important clue to anaphora identification in actual spoken Japanese discourse is not utilized explicitly. ,-L3~ Extension of topic introduction","One of the p~'ob]ems with the topicobased approach is that topics re£erred to by zero pronouns are not always e:~'pli('itiy marked by the topic postposition wa. Sometimes, the NPs a*'e never fi)und in discourse in s~rictly the same tbr~.,.~s as they a,'c ~'ecovered. To deal with all possible cases, ihrtt~er elaboration in the inter-field domain of semantics, p~~t_~matic~, and discourse grammar is needed. Here I will limit my attentio,l to cases analyzable by extending the (:urn'eat method.","First, a certain type of series of words whose function is, like wa, to introduce topics into the discourse, such as no h5 ga, ni tuite desu ga, no ken desu l~,a, and no koto desu ga, are handled in the same way as wa both syntactically and discourse-grammatically.","Second, more complicated cases of topic introduction sentence patterns are also treated.","(3) Watasi no y£tzin de sanka o bibS-site iru I GEN friend COP participation OnJ want-PROGR mono ga iru n desu ga... person SBJ exist EXPL-POL INTRD A friend of mine wants to participate in the conference. (He ...)","As illustrated in (3), the sentence pattern <NP ga VEXISTENTIAL u/no desu ga> is employed to implicitly introduce the NP as a topic into the discourse. To meet such cases, the lexical description of the topic-introductory ADV head ga is specified so that the SEM value of the subject of the subcategorizcd-fbr existential verb unifies with the (implicit) topic of the whole sentence. 4. Identification by means of predicate information 4.1. Honorific predicate","Japanese has a rich grammatical system of honorlfics. Among them, expressions related to the discussion here are subject-honorific and object-honorific predicates. Subject-honorific predicate is a form of predicate used to express respect to the person referred to by the subject of the predicate. Object-honorific predicate is used to express respect to the direct or indirect object of the predicate whose subject.-agent is the speaker or his/her in-group member.","In conversation, the omitted subject of subject-honorific predicate is typically the hearer. And, conversely, the subject of this type of predicate is usually omitted when referring to the hearer, as in (4). This is evidently in order to avoid the redundancy, in case there is no one else worth paying respect to, of the speaker being explicitly indicated as subject while at the same time the subject identity is virtually limited to the speaker by the predicate's honorific information. Likewise, the direct or indirect object of object.-honorific predicates is typically the hearer and the subject is typically the speaker, and the two NPs are usually omitted when this holds, as in example (5).","(4) ¢ kaigi ni sanka-sarenai no nara, conference ()IM2 parl, ieipate-SSJltONlt-NEG COND 781 mury~ de ke/~k5 desu. free' Ooe all right COP-POL If you don't attend the conference, it will be free.","(5) 0 ¢ thzitu uketuke de ,;iry6syft o o~watasi simasu. that day reception 1,OC proceedings OBJ give-OBJIIONR-POL Proceedings will be given to you on the first day of the conference at the reception.","~E[owever, Japanese honoiific predicate forms do not correspond to grammatical persons a.¢~ rigidly as the Enl\"opean languages' verb inflec~ien. Tixe omitted subject of (4) and the omitted indirect t)bjeet of (5) may be someone else worthy of respect, and the omitted subject of\" (5) may be the speaker's in-group member. A mechanism is needed which identifies the omitted subject of the subject-honorific predicate and the object of the object-honorific predicate with the hearer, a~d the omitted subject of the object-honorific predicate with the speaker by default, and otherwise (when specific information is given) identifies them with a person explicitly given in the context,.","Lexical descriptions of honorific verbs and auxiliariez must meet the condition above. For example, the lexical description of a subject-honorific auxiliary reru is as follows (the feature specification depends on that for honorifics by Maeda et al. 1988)","(DEFI_EX re VSTEM ()","[[HEAD [[POS V] [crYPE VOW(vowel-st,)m-type, i .e. itidan)] [CFORM STEM] [MODL(modat) [[DEAC(doactlve) SHON(sbj--honorific)]]]]]","[SUBCAF {[[IIEAD [[POS P][FORM Ra][GRF SUBJ]]] [SUBCAT {}] [SEM ?x]] [[HEAD [[POS VII","[CTYPE (:OR CONS-UV CON~-V SURU)]","[CFORM VONG(vuice-negtive, i.e. tnizen,~I~ei)]","[MODL IDEAC~]]] [SUBCAT {[[HEAD [[POS P][FDRM ga][GRF SUDJ]]]","[SUBCAT {}]","[SEM ?x]]}] [SEM ?SE~]]}]","[SEM ?SEM]","[PIRAG (p ragmatics)","[[SPEAKER ?SPEAKER] [HEARER ?HEARER] [RESIRS(restrictions) {[[RELN RESPECI']","[AGEN ?SPEAKER]","[OBJE ?X]]}]]]] (?X =d ?SPEAKER)) N.B.

The CTYPE value in the SUBCAT specifics the conjugation type eI' the subcategorizcd V, i.e. consonant-stem-type and suru4ype (Vs with other conjugation types are subcategorized-for by rareru, an allomorph of reru). The MODL is used to impose conditions on the possibility of mutual subcategorization between different ldnds of Vs. In order to meet the unorderedness of Japanese case phrases, the value of the SUBCAT feature is a set (Gunji 1987) instead of an ordered list adopted in the HPSG English gramrnar (Pollard & Sag 1987). The set is expressed by a rule reader into its cm'responding possible ordered list descriptions.","The semantic value of the subject (?X) is restricted by the PRAG feature (the feature for describing the pragznatic constraint) to be someone being respected by the speaker. 782","/ When it is not filled by the analy,(~is depend'e;~i~ on explicit inlbrmation, it deihult~ to the speaker by means of\" == d\".","This lexical description is embedded into the total zero pronoun identification mechanism by revising TSIJ: lopic Supplementation Principle (2nd Version)","1.

Deictic predictsre","One of the major features of spoken Japanese discourse is its frequent use of\" deictic predicates, i.e. forms of predicates which change according to the empathic relatio~ between tb.e persen~s involved. The most easily understood examples are go and come in English. Besides their cmmterparts iku and huru, Japanese has a trichotomous system of donatory verbs, inc. yaru (give), hureru (give), and morau (receive). Kurer~ is used when the receiver is Uhe speaker or his/her in-group member (e.g. his/her ihm[iy)o Otherwise yarn is used ~o express give. These forras are also employed as ao.~iliarics on the same deictic condition when the action expressed by the main verb involves giving or receiving of laver. They appear frequently in spoken Japanese dialogue as constituents of speech-act~related complex predicates. :[,'or example,","(6) ¢ ¢ hotel no tehai wa site kureru no desu ~a? hotel GEN ~'eservation TOP do-RECFAV EXP!,-POL QUP,~ST Could you reserve a hotel [or me?","As in (6), the subject and indirect object of the auxiliary are typically the hearer slid speaker, respectively, and when this is the case, the subject and indirect object are usually omitted° I::[owever, like those in honorific predicates, the omii.ted subj¢~,ct and indirect object of deict~c auxiliaries have rio fixed case values.

The figure reflects the ordered relation among the three components: what intrasentential syntax cannot disambiguate is handled by the topic structure, and then the rest goes to the predicate inibrmation component. N.B. Anaphora identification (beth zero and explicit anaphora) is made more effectively and widely if a model of objects appearing in the discourse with their linguistically expressed and default PRAG features is formalized. This was partly done by Maeda et al. 1988 by means of Discourse Representation Theory. 6. Conclusion","TDS (Topic-driven Discourse Structure), a Japanese dialogue discourse structure that resolves zero anaphora reference, was proposed on the basis of topic structure. Inlbrmation carried by predicates on honorificity, deixis, speech act and mental activities is also utilized i~ connection with TDS. The method conforms well with the way zero anaphora actually functions in spoken Japanese discourse. Of the zero pronouns in the inter-terminal conversation data, 79.8% were cases identifiable by this approach.
