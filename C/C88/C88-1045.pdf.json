Some examples (for Czech adjectives) are presented at the end of the paper. In these examples, the formalism's rules are used for the phonology-based changes as well, but nothing prevents the use of a separate phonology level (e.g. of the Koskenniemi's two-level model) as a front- (and back-) end for the analysis (and synthesis)."]},{"title":"1. Th~ Notiva¢ion","paragraphs":["Using a computer, the morphological level is a basis for building the syntaotlcosemantic part of any NL analysis. The CL world pays more attention to morphology only after the work /Koskenniemi 1983/ was published. However, as Kay remarked (e.g. in /Kay 1987/), phonology was actually what was done in /Koskenniemi 1983/. Moreover, the strategy used there is best suited for agglutinative languages with almost one-to-one mapping between morpheme and grammatical meaning, but slavonic languages are different in this respect.","One of the praotigal reasons for formalizing morphology is that although there are some computer implementations using a Czech morphology subsystem (/Haji~,Oliva 1986/, IKirschner 1983/, /Kirschner 1987/), based on the same sources (/EBSAT VI 198~/, /EBSAT VII 1982/), no unifying formalism for a complete description of formal morphology exists. 2."]},{"title":"The Po~malimm","paragraphs":["The terms alphabet, string, concatenation, • ~., symbol N (positive integers), indexes and are used here in the same way as in the formal grammar theory; the symbol exp(A) denotes the set of all subsets of A, e denotes an empty string. Uppercase letters .are used mainly for denotin~ sets and newly defined structures, lowercase letters are used for mappings, for elements of an alphabet and for strings. I~finition i. A finite set K of symbols is called a set of grammatical meanings (or simply meanings for short); values from K represent values of morphological categories (e.g, sg may represent singular number, p3 may represent dative (\"3rd case\") for nouns, etc.). Definition 2- A finite set D = ((w,i) E A* x (N , {0))], where A is an alphabet, is called a dictionary. A pair (w,i) ~ D is called a dictionary entry, w is a lexical unit and i is called pattern number. In the linguistic interpretation, a lexical unit represents the notion \"systemic word\", but it need not be represented by a traditional dictionary form. Defini~i,n 3. Let A be a finite alphabet, K a finite set of meanings, V a finite alphabet of variables such that A a V = £). The quintuple (A,V,K,t,R) where t is a mapping t: V ~> exp(A*) assigni,~g types to variables, R is a finite 'set of rules (I,H,u,v,C), where I ~ N is is a finite set (of labels), C ~ (N u {0}7 is a finite set (of continuations), H n K is a set of meanings belongin~ to a particular rule from R, u,v E (A u V)-, is called a controlled rewriting system (ORS)| all variables from the left-hand side (u) must be present on the right-hand side (v) and vice versa (rule symmetry according to variables). Definition 4. Let T = (A,V,K,t,R) be a CRS. A (simple) substitution on T will be any mapping q: V -> A*| q(v) s t(v). I)efini~ion 5- Let T = (A,V,K,t0R) be a ORS and q a simple substitution on T. Happin~ d: CA , V) z -> A ~ such that d(e) = e| d(a) = a for a ~ A| d(v) = q{v) for v ~ V; d(bu) = d(b)d(u) for b E CA v V), u s CA , V) ~ will be called (generalized) substitution derived from q. Comment. The (generalized) substitution substitutes tin a given string) all variables by some string. The ~ame string is substituted for all oucu~ences of this variable (follows from the definition). Definition 6. Let T = (A,V,K,~,R) be a CRS and F ~ K. Let then G, G' ~ K, w,z ~ (A , V) ~, i E N, i' E (N u {0}). Me say that w ~an be directly rewritten in the state (i0G) to z with a continuation (i',G') according to meanings F (written as w(i,G) =>[T,F] ~(i',G')), if there exist such rule (l,H,u,v,C) E R and such simple substitution q on T, that i ~ I, i' s C, H n F, G = G' , H, d(u) = w and d(v) = z, where d is the substitution derived from q. Relation =>~[T,F] is defined as the reflexive and transitive closure of =>iT,F]. Comment. The CRS is controlled through continuations and labels. After a dlreot rewriting operation, the only rules that could be applied next must have in their label at least one number from the rewritln K operation continuation. Please notice that: -","this operation always rewrite~ whole words| -","the restriction on the left-hand and right-hand side of a rule that it should be only string (of letters and/or variables) is not so strong as it may seem, because no restrictions are imposed on the substitution q.

Comment. The \"strange\" sets G and G' from the definition 6 acquire a real meaning only in connection with the definition of patterns; they have a controlling task during pi cons%)ruction, namely, they check whether all meanings from F are used during the derivation. \"To use a meaning k\" means here that th,:~re is some rule (l,H,u,v,C) applied in the ~ourse of derivation from w(i,F) to z(O,()) such that k E H. Such meaning can then be removed from G when constructing G' (see Def~ 7); meanings not from H cannot. Thus, to get the empty set in z(O,()) when startin~ from w(i,F), all meanings from F must be \"used\" in this sense. A patte>?n describes how to construct to a given wo>zd w all possible forms according to meaning~ F.. In this sense, the notion of pattern does not differ substantially from the traditional notion of pattern in formal morphology, although traditionally, not the constructive description, but just some represent;afire of such a description is called a pattern.

The term morphology description introduced above is a counterpart to a description of a system of' formal morphology, as used in traditional literature on morpholo~y. Definition 9 is introduced here just for the purpose of formalization of the notion of word form, i.e. any form derived from any word from the dictionary using all possible meanings according to H[T].

The term syn.i;hesis on M is used for a mapping s: exp(K) x A ~ -> exp(A*); s(H,w) = (z; ex. i N, i <~= n; z ~ pi(H,w) & (w,i) E D}. The term ant~lysis is used then for a mapping a: A ~ -> exp(exp(K) x A~); a(z) = ((H,w); z s{H,w)). Comment. According to definition I0, synthesi~ means to use patterns for words from the dictionary only. The definition of analysis; is based on the syhthesis definition, so it clearly and surely follows the intuition what an analysis is. In this sense, these definitions don't differ substantially from the traditional view on formal morphology, as opposed to Koskenniemi; however, the so~called oomplex word forms (\"have been called\") are not covered, and their an~Iysis is shifted to syntax. The definition of analysis is quite clear, but there is no procedure contained, capable of actually carrying out this process. However, thanks to rule symmetry it is possible to reverse the rewriting process: Definition tl. Let T = (A,V,K,t,R) be a ORS. Further, let G G = a K, i ~ N, i' ~ (N v (0)), z,w E A ~. He say that under ~he condition (i',G') it is possible to directly analyse a string z to w with a continuation (i,G) (we write z(i',G' ) =<[T] w(i,G)), if there exists a rule (I,H,u,v,C) E R and a simple substitution q on T such that i E I, i' E C, G = G' u H, d(u) = w a d(v) = z, where d is the generalized substitution derived from q. A relation \"it is possible to analyze\" (=<~[T]) is defined as a reflexive and transitive closure of =<[T]. Definition 12. Let T = (A V,K,t,R) be a ORS and z e A . Every strln~ w s A , i e N and F","}< such that z(O,£}) =< \"[T] w(i,F) is called a predecessor of z with a continuation (i,F). Lemma. Let T = (A,V,K,t,R) be a ORS and w E A* a predecessor of string z g A * with a continuation (i,P). Then z E pi(F,w), where pi is a pattern by T (see Def. 7). Proof (idea). The only \"asymmetry\" in the definition of => as opposed to =<, i.e. the condition H n F, can be solved putting (see Def. 11) P = (} v HI u H~ u • .. ~, Hn (for n analysis steps). Then surely Hi a F for every i. Theorem. Let T = (A,V,K,t,R) be a CRS, H = (A,D,K,P) an H[T]-desoription, a an analysis by H and w s A* a predecessor of z e A ~ with a continuation (i,F). Moreover, let (w,i) E D. Then (F,w) ~ a(z). Proof follows from the precedin~ lemma and from the definition of analysis. Comment. This theorem helps us to manage an analysis of a word form: we begin with the form being analysed (z) and a \"continuation '' (0,(3), using then \"reversed\" rules for back rewriting. In any state w(i,F) during this process, a correct analysis is obtained whenever (w,i) is found in the dictionary. At the same time we have in F the appropriate meanings. Passin~ along all possible paths of back rewriting, we obtain the whole set a(z)."]},{"title":"3.
