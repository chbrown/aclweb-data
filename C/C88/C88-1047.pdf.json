The distribution of grammaticality over (1) through (5) is accounted for by as-suming the h)llowing constraints on the syntactic structure of English.","(6) Passing of a dislocated element is permitted only between the mother and the head daughter or between the mother and the complement daughter. '","(7) Passing of a dislocated element and binding of another cannot take place simultaneously in one local tree.","In (1), every passing obeys this constraint. For instance, passing the dislocated element bound by 'Who/' into $1 and passing it into S, are both O.K., because S~ is the cmnplement of 'know' and S~ is the complement of 'that' (whether you might employ a transformational account or such theories as GPSG, HPSG, and LFG.).","However, (2) violates (6) and (7) First, the dislocated element bound by 'What/' is passed into $2, which is not a complement but an adjunct of 'girl'; i.e., a violation of (6) Second, the same dislocated element is passed into VP2 where another dislocated element gets bound by 'who', ending up with a violation of (7). Similarly in (3) and (4), passing and binding co-occur at the local trees introducing 'who' and 'whatj', respectively, violating (7). (5) is blocked by (7), because of the passinginto the subject'a story about es'; i.e., the specifier of INFL (in the transformational account) or of VP (in theories like GPSG, etc.)."]},{"title":"2.3 Cognitive Aspects of Constraints","paragraphs":["The explanations about such phenomena proposed in contemporary linguistic inquiries, especialiy the accounts in terms of barriers /Chomsky 1986/, are roughly regarded as formalizations of the idea sketched above. This line of reasoning is in turn attributed to processing terms, when viewed from the stand-point of cognitive science. The background intuition is that 232 the extent of processing load imposed by a syntactic operation varies from one type of operation to another, and that there is an upperbound on the total processing load for constituting one branching local tree. On account of this, the reason why passing tend to be blocked under the certain sorts of circum stances would be that it is an expensive operation a11d thus is hard to perform together with other expensive operations such as adjunction or binding..","The processing load for carrying out various syntactic operations could be further reduced to more fundamental aspects of information processing. Consider, for instance, why specification and adjnnction should be harder than cornplementat~on. q'he reason seems to be that complementation is lexical]y li tensed and is head-initial (the current discussion is limited to English); i.e., the occurrence of a complement licensed by the lexical entry of its head and thus is predicted from the occurrence of the preceding head. On the other hand, the occurrence of a specifier or of an adjunct is harder to predict, because the former (though lexically licensed) precedes its head and the latter is not lexically licensed by the head. Passing and binding of dislocated elements are also considered to be non-lexical operations, though there are a few exceptions involving, for example, so-called tough adjectives, as indicated by the following sentence. (8) [Which violin]/is [this sonata]j [Apeasy to play ej on q]? The difference between (4) and (8) is that the binding of the dislocated element carrying index j is lexically licensed in the latter but not in the former. In (8), the binding in effect occurs at the local tree expanding AP, where this binding is sanctioned by the ]exical entry of 'easy'. This is why (8) is grammatical de spite (7); i.e., the lexically licensed binding is not an expensive operation, so that it does not play the same role as ordinary binding would play in regard of (7).","Note that the processing load concerning the examples we have discussed so far is defined within a single sentence structure rather than by taking structural ambiguity into account. This is why the traditional syntactic approaches are able to capture some of such aspects of language; in principle, properties of a single structure can be characterized in static terms."]},{"title":"3 Dynamic Account","paragraphs":["However, the above static approach cannot by itself explain some UBD phenomena, especially so-called the Complex NP Constraint (originally termed by Ross /Ross 1967/) observed in the examples that follow. (9) *Whoi do you believe [NPl[mp2the claim] [gsthat [ssshe","loves q]]]? (10) *What/ did you propose a plan [vP to buy el]? In (9), Sa is the complement of 'claim'. Hence the dislocated element, bound by 'Who/' should be permitted to be passed into Sa without violating (6). Similarly, VP (or CP, in the trausformational account) in (10) is regarded as the eomplelnent of 'plan', so that the dislocated element bound by 'What/' should be able to pass through, (6) aud (7) being respected. Hence the static account in the previous section provides no reason why these examples should be ungrammatical. It is considered because of essentially the same sort of difficulty that Chomsky /Chomsky 1986/ leaves unexplained this type of island effect."]},{"title":"3ol A Model of Language Processing","paragraphs":["Now then let us turn to dymunic aspects of language processing, and consider what kind of syntactic structures a human bearer should have tmilt and tentatiwdy maintains when 'that' in (9) is encountered.

The essential difference between (7) and (17) is that the latter can mention a rule which simultaneously handles several hypothetical structures of the same sentence; i.e., a rule which explicitly deals with a local structural ambiguity. That is, (17) does, but (7) does not, reject such a rule if it binds a dislocated element in a sentence structure and at the same time passes another dislocated element in another structure, the two structures corresponding to two different hypotheses.","Now let us return to (14b~;15a).

This time a is the dislocated element bound by this binder, and the one bound by 'Whati'.","Note that this explanation concerns language acquisition by children, rather than language use by adults. It must concern the acquisition stage; otherwise what we have shown would not be the ungrammaticality of (9) and (10) but merely the diffi-234 culty of processing them. In fact, the above account does apply to language acquisition, because the ambiguity pertaining to (14) and (15) occm's every time a structure like (13) is encountered, so that its disambiguation can be fixated as a part of the grammar of English to be acquired. 3.3 Rules Handling Local Ambiguity Further discussion are in order here about the generalized constraint (17) and its role in the above explanation. First, the above discussion postulates that the grammar rules are sensitive to structural ambiguity such as (14) and (].5) about (9), in the sense that some rules of syntax work on multiple structures, and thus are in charge of disambiguation. Here one might worry which types of ambiguity are handled by the grammar, and which are handled metagrammatically. Not every sort: of ambiguity is visible to the grammar, as is demonstrated by the following example, which is grammatical. (19) Whoi did you tell the man [~4that Is, she loves ¢/]]?","The local ambiguity arising here appears sirrfilar to that of (9). More precisely, a four-way local ambiguity arises at ~that', as a combination of two pieces of independent two-way ambiguity, one concerning whether 'that' is a relative pronoun or a conjunction, and the other whether or not $4 contains a gap bound by 'Who/', just as in (9).: An outstanding difference between (9) and (19), however, is that the ambiguity in the latter case involves two different hypothetical constituent structures that follow. (20) [vp[vltell [Nplthe man]] [g that Ss]] (21) [Gtell [NP2[Nplthe man] [g that Ss]]] To children learning UBD constructions, both of these constituent structures should appear ambiguous about whether or not S~ contains a gap bound by 'Whoi'.","This ambiguity, unlike the one in (9), is considered invisible to the grammar, presumably because of the above ditference. That is, if any single rule were sensitive to this ambiguity, (19) should be rendered ungrammatical for the same reason why (9) is so, because in (19) a dislocated element would be bound by 'that' and another dislocated element would be passed into $4 simultaneously. To make sure that the binding and the passing should be simultaneous here, notice that the local tree expanding S~ is completed simultaneously in the two pairs of hypotheses corresponding respectively to (20) and (21). Itence the binding by 'that' and the passing into Ss must take place simultaneously.","Seemingly the reason why the grammar is not sensitive to this type of local ambiguity is that the four possibilities are not coherent enough, in the sense that they are distributed across the two distinct constituent structures as mentioned above. It appears that the disambiguation of a local structural ambiguity is acquired as a part of the grammar only if the structures (or hypotheses) constituting that ambiguity are coherent enough with each other. Comparing (19) with (9) and (10), one might thus posit the following constraint.","(22) A local structural ambiguity is handled within the grammar only if the parallel structures involved therein share the same constituent structure.","As for (9), for instance, besides (13) there could of course be several other structural possibilities, but they are simply it-. relevant to the acquMtion process discussed above, rather than :~ystemat, ica.lly abandoned like (14a&15a) and (14b&15a). We would then be able to disregard any interaction across distinct constituent structures when considering the competence grammar.","There are ~,|; least two more supports to constraint (22). l\"irst, (22) f)llows from the following more fundamentM constraint.","(23) There is a severe limit, ou the size of the structure which one rule of syntax can refer to at once. An arnbigui'i;y within one constituent structure tends to full within this limit, because the parallel structures involw'.d therein share most i;f the storage with each other. An ambiguity across several con:~(.ituenl, structures, howc'ver, wouht more often run out of this limit, since, the rate of the shared memory is smldler. Note that"]},{"title":"(2a)","paragraphs":["claims, after all, nothing more than the lira]tat.ion on the complexity of mentally feasible rules.","Another reason h)r holding (22) is based on how ~stuhborn' an ambiguity is. As menl;ioned earlier, patterns like (9) and (10) constantly ;~ccompany the local ambiguity like (14) plus (15). In contrast, patterns like (19) are often less ambiguous, as shown in tile example below. (24) Whoi did you tell him [g that she loves ell?","In this s.mtence, the possibilit;y of 'that' being a relatiw~ pronoun i,s very unplausible, the local ambiguity being greatly w.duced; we are left with the aml)iguity of whether or not tit(; dislocai, ed element bound by 'Whoi' is coutaiiled in $6. Ill sum mary, the ambiguity in (9) and (]0) is robust, while that in (19) is fragile. An ambiguity within a single constituent structure tends I;o be robust, tn comparison, an ambiguity encompass.- ing several different constituent structnres tends to be fragile, because the relationship (as for which is more plausible than which, etc.) between those eonstituent structures varies from case to case, depending on tim internal details of the relevanl; constituents context, and so on. The corresponding relation in lhe former tgpc of aml)iguity, oil the ol, her hand, is more constant. Robu:;t ambiguity is visible to the grammar, while fragile one is not; Some rules of syntax handle tile former, while the latter is trea{,ed metagrammatically. 304 Cerman Case ']~he following pair of German examples might fall out of our dynamic account on (9) and (10). (25) Weni glauben Sic, dab er ei liebl;? (26) *Wen/glauben Sie die Behauptung, duff er ei liebt? (25) and (2fi) are (.lerman counterparts of (1) and (9), respectively. Note that the direct translation between English and Cerman pre::erves grammaticality across these pairs of exam ples.","Since ']~ehauptung' ix of the feminine geuder rather than neuter, ~daff should not be confused with a relative pronoun, namely 'die' or ~der', whose antecedent is 'Behanptuug'; The relative proi)oun pronounced the same as 'daft' is 'das', which is of I;he neul, er gender and the nominative or accusative case. So it appears that in the case of (26) children learning German should face no ambiguity like ( 14 ).

A success of computational explanation does not necessarily support either innatis m (~ la N. Chomsky, J. A. Fodor, D. Marr, etc.) or eonstruetivism (~ la J. Piaget, etc.). If any part of hmnan in-teliigence could be understood to be the outcome of a simple optimization for some computation, it should subject to two different interpretations: that this part should be a domainspecific innate endowment because such a simple optimization may well be preprogrammed in the course of evolution, or, contrariwise, that it should be generated after birth by the work of the domain-independent general intelligence because such a simple optimization could be carried out through maturation and internal experiences. Further scrutiny would thus be simply needed in order to steer our way either to innatist or constructionist dispositior/.","Along the line of the present argument, perhaps the first point where we could face the choice between these two doctrines is the problem of how much processing load we should ascribe to various syntactic operations. The evaluation of computational load as we have exploited here should vary across languages, depending on the relative statuses of syntactic operations. For instance, the situation must be drasticMly different between dominantly head-initial languages like English and Spanish and head-final languages such as Japanes e and Korean (and maybe German, too). Also open to further scrutiny is whether the variation is explained by the parameter setting approach of transformational theories, or by more general computational considerations."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["/Bresnan 1982/ Bresnan, J.: (ed.)"]},{"title":"The Mental Representation of Grammatical Relations,","paragraphs":["MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. /Chomsky 1986/ Chomsky, N.:"]},{"title":"Barriers,","paragraphs":["MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","/GKPS 1985/ Gazdar, G., Klein, K., Pullum, G., and Sag, I.:"]},{"title":"Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar,","paragraphs":["Basil Blackwell, Oxford. /Hasida 1985/ Hasida, K.:"]},{"title":"Bounded Parallelism: A ~Tteory of Linguistic Performance,","paragraphs":["Doctoral Dissertation, Univer~ sity of TSky5. /Marcus 1980/ Marcus~ M.P.:"]},{"title":"A Theory of Syntactic Recognition for Natural Language,","paragraphs":["MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. /Mills 1986/ Mills, A.E.:"]},{"title":"The Acquisition of Gender: A Study of English and German,","paragraphs":["in Springer Series in Language and Communication, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heiderberg. /Pollard 1984/ Pollard, C.J.:"]},{"title":"Generalized Phrase-Structure Grammar, Head Grammars, and Natural Languages,","paragraphs":["Doctoral Dissertation, Stanford University, Stanford, California. /Pollard 1985/ Pollard, C.J.:"]},{"title":"Lecture Notes on tlead-Driven Phrase-Structure Grammar';","paragraphs":["Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University, Stanford, California. /Ross 1967/ Ross, J.P~.:"]},{"title":"Constraints on Variables in Syntax,","paragraphs":["Doctoral Dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts."]},{"title":"235","paragraphs":[]}]}
