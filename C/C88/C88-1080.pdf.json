Stress Is put on the particular grammar rule model adopted, named Complex Grammar Units, and on the parsing algorithm that runs rules written In according to this model. Moreover, the parser is like a processor and sees grammar rules as processes which cart be activated or Inactivated, and eaxi handle exchange of information, structured as :messages, among rules for long distance analysis. A brief description of the frmnework of SAIL a user can interact with, neaned SiS, is also given. Finally, an example shows that different greanmar formalisms can be implemented into the frame of SAIL. X o INTRODUCTION","Most recent research in the field of grammar Ibrmalisms and parsers for naturallanguage has seen the flourishing of various theoretical as well as coralmtational accounts, which, however, bring into consideration the same lacts. The most relevant ones ~,mem the following: -~ whatever representation is adopted for the structure of the parsed sentence (basically f-structures or trees), it is agreed that {complex) sets of features must describe the linguistic units. It is, therefore, necessary to provide feature handling mechanisms;","long distance dependency, or, more generMly, dependency, requires a specific treatment, which Is to be naturally embedded in the theoretical or computational model of syntax, and must be subject to language dependent constraints. In aaly case, the treatment of dependencies takes the form of a differently constrained search Ibr a referent; - a certaln amount of context-sensitiveness is to be allowed in natural language parsing.","As an additional feature of recent research, the l~mlinatlon towards the one-to-one correspondence between semantic and syntactic rules has to be mentioned.","SAIL Is the parsing algorithm of a development environment, called SAIL Interfacing System, where different grammars corresponding to different grammatical theories can be hnplemented (/Marlno 1988/I. Its basic features, which allow full implementation of grmnmars and their debugging are as lbllows:","a ,teh lmlguage for the handling of features;","grammar rules are seen as processes which can be activated or Inactivated, and can exchange messages; this mechanism allows a natural treatment of dependencies and the running of context-sensitive rules;","the format of the rules Is such as to allow semantic processing in parallel with syntactic processing;","the traditional structure of the parser, a bottomoup all-paths algorithm, allows relative efficiency mid the 590 ca W integration of a diagnostic component fi~w debugging;","the development envirotJrnent is based on dllterent layers of rules, which are processed by the same parser and can handle the external interface, the particular application, and the debugger. This enables the user to modify also the front-end of SAIL, by modifying tile corresponding grammar. 2.

Rules can assume two different ~tates: aettve or i~xaefive state. A rule is aettw.~ when the parser normally takes it into account for application; rules are acLivc when their names are in their colresponding packets. A rule is inae, ttve when the parser does not normally take it into consideration for application; rules are inactive when their names are not in any packet. It is possible to modify the state of a rule by memm of two 39] tunetions within the augmentations dining a rule application. A rule R, changes its state from active to Inactive if some rule Rj calls within its augmentations the function nile-dtsable for R,, performing a disabling operation; on the termination of the disabling rule R j, the disabled nile name R, is removed from the corresponding packet, and the parser does not take into account R,, Conversely, a rule l~ ehaazges its state from Inactive to active If some rule","calls the function rule-enable for Ph within its augmentations, perlbrming an enabling operation. On the termination of tlm enabling rule R r the enabled rule name R, becomes present into the corresponding packet. It Is possible to change the state of one or more rules at a time through these functions and the rules can perform self-enabling and self:disabling operations. Changes of state effected during the parsing are not penuanent. At the end of each parse the rules are reconfigured as indicated in their original definition.","In addition we cruz invoke an inactive rule for just one application from another rule. We say that an inactive rule R~ is activated to be applied Just once, when a call to the function rifle-activation is in some augmentation of another rule R r The activation of an inactive rule R, allows just one application of it by the parser, immediately after the termination of the activating rule R r The state of the activated rule Is not modified. The activation of more than one rule at a time Is possible, and once a rule ls activated it can activate other rules, 4o CONTEXTUAL RULES","Rule activation bymeans of the rule-actlvation function, together with NOP rules can be used to handle context sensitive languages, However, rials is entirely done by means of CF productions and the augmentations.","A typical CS production is: ~h A p~ --~ p, 1~ ~h where p,, p~, 13 are strings Of symbols, and A is a non-terminal symbol. A bottom-up applieation of such a production is possible lfit happens in two steps: 1) indlviduation of the context p~ I~ P~; the right-hand side must match a sequence of sub-trees that covers 1~13 1~; 2} Inside this context we can perform the api~lleaflon of the CF production A .-~ [~ building the node A over the sequence of nodes characterized by ~l. So the complete application for a CS production is made in two steps: the tlrst one concerns context determination, the context being represented by the right-hand side of the CS production; the second step is just the application of a CF production if and only if the first step has determined the context where the CF production is applicable. These considerations allow us to say that: step 1 can be performed by the application ofa NOP rule using the NOP-special categories; in fact this kind of rule Is useful in detet~ining the context by defining a NOP rule with production:","{ <NOP> I <NOP.-SE> I <NOP-ASE> } -->"]},{"title":"~t, ~","paragraphs":["bt2 Step 2 can be performed by the application of an activated rule; in fact, wizen the rule at step 1 determines the context it cart activate an inactive rule with a production A--~13, indicating in the cMI to rule-activation the last node In the sequence ~. Now we can give the definition of contextual nile. We say that a rule is contextual if it is a NOP rule with production:","{<NOP> I <NOP-SE> [ <NOP-ASE> } -~ w z ... w and inside the augmentations there is a rule activation of ,gJ~g_~t one inactive rule which has a production:","A --> w k wk.~ ... w~, 1 <_k.<_m~n","Ae VNu{<NOI~>,<NOP-SE>,<NOP-/LSE>} 392 where VN is the set of the non--terminal symbols of the grammar. This definition allows a nesting of contextual xnules: In thct an activated rule can be a contextual rule itself, In addition, we can activate more than one rule at a time; in this way we can access several contexts Inside a main context.","We suggest a method to make possible asynchronous operations, i.e., how two independent rules can interact with each other in order to perform long distance operations. All this is based on the fact that we must be sure that a certain rule will be applied after mlother and the earlier rule wants to communicate some information to the other one, To this end we have adopted a communication meeharflsm, that we call message pa~alug, which Is not based on nmtehing as all the previously explained opexations, but on executing two basic tasks: sending and receiving, The sending task is firstly performed by the sending rule that sends a message to a receiving rule; afterwards the receiving rule must perlbrm the receiving task to receive the message, These two tasks are executed by the two rules at two independent thnes, i.e., when the rules are applied, In the following we denote the sending rule as Rs and the receiving rule as Rr, and we assume they are standard rules: so we denote with SN the node built by Rs mad with RN the node built by Pa °. We state two different approaches for what a ~is: 1) the rules access a global feature structure where they store global features. Each role can access this structure and whatever feature value In It; 2) a Message-Box exists where a rule can send a message to another specified rule. \"l~e Message-Box is accessible from every rule but the messages are accessible only by receiving rules. A message is composed as follows: a reference to the teature structure of SN: Rs makes avafiable its feature structure to Rr; a sequence of operations, possibly empty, that Rr ~-o.ust execute. It Is not necessm3r that both these Items m'e present ina message,","In the case of the global feature structure all the rules have access to It. We recall that all the feature structures Included Ill the nodes of the graph are local to their own node, Each rule earl store in or get from the global structure features that are global for the sentence: then the messages are feature structures and the same type of oIJerations allowed on the feature structures of the nodes of the graph Is possible on this sta~aetureo","The Message-Box Is a structure referred to by all rules that want to send or receive messages. A rule Rs, building the node 8N. sends a message which is automatically inserted In the Message-Box specifying: Its name Rs, the receiving rule Rr, a reference to the feature structure of SN which is made available to Rr, a list of operations, possibly empty, to be perlbrmed by Rr. Until the messages are sent, they are the exclusive property of Rs. Wizen they are sent Rs loses Its property, rights, and only the rule Rr specified In the messages is authorized to get them. In addition, Rr finds In the message a reference to a feature structure ~md this structure is available only to It and always local to its own node.","Message passing, In either of the two realizations, is a way to facilitate the tndlviduation and treatment of existing relations among phrases or parts of them. It is certainly flexible and not expensive because It avoids searches, i,e., matches, Inside the graph, and it can be a valid alternative to NOP rules that require a certain number of matches to find particular nodes In the graph. In fact, if there was not overlapping of the sub--trees rooted In SN and RN, thenwe can solve relations between SN and RN by applying a proper NOP rule, but, more efficiently, message passing allows us to avoid a certain computational overhead peribnning proper operations directly in Iks and Rx.","When NOP rules are applied they act upon a structure already built. It Is also possible to activate i~ales that pertbl-m further building (contextual rules) and/or teaturing operations within a context. This process of activation can be nested many times inside a certain structure, This analysis per/orms a kind of operation that is virtually directed toward the bottom, in depth. If there was a partial or total overlapping between the sub-trees rooted In SN and RN, then - In this case .- when iLs sends a message;, assuraes that Rr will be applied above its node SN; in thkl way it Is possible to evaluate the consequences of certain operations on a structure which Is not yet but It could be butt. In this case we act toward the top of the parsing slxueture, through as many levels as we want, In contrast, using NOP rules, we only act on an existing structure representing deeper levels.","So we can distinguish two ways of operation for long distance analysis araong phrases or parts of them: breadth ;malysls, using both NOP rules or message passing; depth analysis which can be top-down with NOP rules or bottom-up with message passing.","The mechanism of the messages so described is performed through functions that can be used within the augmentations. 6° TI-~ P,,~RSER","Our parser is a CF-based one, derived from the ICA (inmledia~:e Constituent Analysis) algorithm described in /Gxishman 1976/, designed to run CGU rules, carrying out the syntactic and semantic analysis In parallel. It is a bottom-up algorithm, a~nd it performs left-toorlght scanning and reduction in an Immediate constituent analysis. The data structure It works on is a graph where all possible parse trees are connected. The complete parse h'ee(s) is (are) extracted from the graph in a subsequent step, Therefore, the parser Is also able to create structure fragment,~ for ill-formed sentences, thus returning, even in tills ca;~e, partial analyses. This Is particularly useful for diagnosis and debugghlg. Parsing te.rmination occurs In a natural way, when no more rule can be applied and the input string is completely scanned,","Before entering the parser a preprocessor scans the sentence fi'om left to ~ght, performs the dictionary lookup tbr each form in the Input string, and returns a structure, tile preprocessed sentence, with the syntactic and semantic Information taken from the dictionary.","The graph Is composed of nodes: the nodes can be either terminals or non-termln~s. Terminal nodes are built in co:a'espondence to a scanned form, whereas non-terminal ones arc built whenever a rule is applied, obviously the rule must not be a NOP rule.","As stated above the parser is seen as a processor arid It sees the rules as processes, It handles a queue of w~ting processes/rules to be executed. When the parser takes a packet, for every rule it builds a process descriptor and Insexts it in the queue. We call such a process descriptor an application specification (AS), while the queue is c~dlcd the application specifications Hst (ASL), ASs are composed of:","a node identifier, through this node the parser starts fl'ie ntatching;","the nmne of the rule that the parser will apply; - only in the case of an AS of an activated rule this Item is the context where the nmned activated rule will be applied, l.e. the nodes that matched the right-hand side of the activating rule, otherwise this item is left empty.","ASs in ASL are ordered depending upon the rule involved in an AS. In general, ff stm~dard active rules have to be executed, ASL is handled with a LIFO policy. If we consider the case of NOP rules° then these rules must be ordered before the others, since featm'e modifications they may produce can ser~e as input to other rules of the same packet, which are applied after them..4.n Inactive rule can be activated Just ibr one application by means of rule-activation traction: the activated rules must be applied immediately alter the end of the activating rule. So this kind of rules has the highest priority of execution with respect to NOP rules and s \"tandard active rules. Then xalle-activation inserts an activation ~pect/tea~lo~ on the top of/KSL for the activated rule. Sunamarlzlng, the roles have the tbllowing decreasing priority order of execution: 1) activated rules; 2) active NOP rules; 3) standard active rules,","Once a node is created, be it terminal (in correspondence to a scarined tbrm) or non~terminal (in eon'espondence to a reduction), the parser inserts In the ASL an AS for every rule in the packet corresponding to the categoxy of the new created node: i.e. the new node Is tile one specified In every inserted AS, The parser performs all possible reductions building more than one node if possible, extracting one AS at a time before analyzing the next one. After ml AS ls extracted tom the ASL, the parser gets file specified rule: the first step is to match the right-hand side on the graph. The nodes matching a right-hand side are searched by the matcher: It returns one or more sets of these nodes, called reduction sets. For every reduction set, the application of the current rule is h-led. In this way we can connect together all possible parses for a sentence in a unique structure. Termination occurs when the ASL is e~.npty and the preprocessed string is completely scanned. Afterwards the parser returns the graph, kom which ~1 parse trees satisi~ing the tbllowing conditions are extracted: a node covers the entire sentence and Its category Is the root symbol of the grmnmar. Here is the complete algorithm of the parser:","* Until the end of tile sentence ts not reached:",", Scan atorm: * Ill,lid a new ternmml xmde for the scanned tbxm; ~ interpretation of the node: o g.~ the packet corresponding to Its categoi T and for every rule In the packet ~ tile AS In the ASL ;","F_Qr~ AS in the ASL: * gt£ the first AS from the top of the ASL; * ggi the specified rule kl tile AS, it Is the current rule, and access to the node specified in the AS, it is tim emxent node; * starting from the cun~nt node perform tile match on the graph using tile production of the current rule; i_f at least one reduction set is found hlh.c_r_l: ° F r_~K._C~YC,~t reduction set:","- Apply the current rule;","o If a new non-terminal node is butt ~ gtk the","corresponding packet to its category and for every rule","in it ~ the AS in the ASL; .¢g.~: o Apply recovery actions of the current rule; In this algorithm by match we mean the operation of searching the reduction sets and by 'apply the current rule' we mean the standard rule application starting from tile test checking as stated for the CGU model; particular ways of application, e,g, NOP rules, depend on the particular rule definition. 7. AN EXAMPLE","The example concerns a simple fragment of a LFG written in SAIL according to the CGU model, Our example is taken from/Kaplan 1982/and/Winograd 1983/. The lexical entries for this grammar in SAIL are the following: a {(Determiner NIL (Definiteness) (Indefinite)","{Number) (singular))) baby ((Noun NIL (Number) (Singular)","(Predicate) {Baby)}} girl {(Noun NIL {Number} (Singular}","(Predicate) {Girl)l} handed ((Verb NIL (Tense) (Past)","(Predicate) (Hand))) the ((Determiner NIL (Definiteness) {Definite))) toys ((Noun NIL (Number) (Plural}","(Predicate) (Toys)))","Rules in SAIL are written using a def~ttle format where all the fields appearing in the CGUs can be defined; in addition two fields are devoted to the state definition (STATUS field) and the rule type definition, that is ff the rule is a standard rule or a contextual or a NOP rule (CNTXTLORNOPR field). The rules are the following:","(defrule NPRule ; NP --> Determiner Noun (STATUS active) (CNTXTLORNOPR NIL) (PRODUCTION (NP (Determiner Noun))) (SYN-TESTS T) (SEM-TESTS T) (SYN-ACTIONS (ralsef \"(* DefiniteneSS Determiner)",";raise the values of the specified features from the",";son node into the parent node","\"(* * Noun)l}}","; second * means all features of the son node",";first * means the storing of the features as they are",";in the son node into the parent node","(defrule VPRule ; VP --> Verb NP NP (STATUS active) (CNTXTLORN OPR NIL) (PRODUCTION (Via (Verb NP NP))) (SYN-TESTS T) (SEM-TESTS T) (SYN-ACTIONS {raiser \"(* * Verb) ;all features of the Verb node are",";copied in the parent node","((Object Definiteness) Definiteness NP) ;lst NP","\"((Object Number) Number NP)","\"((Object Predicate} Predicate NP)","\"((Object-2 Definiteness) Definiteness NP 2} ;2nd NP","\"((Object-2 Number} Number NP 2)","\"((Object-2 Predicate) Predicate NP 2)}))","(defrule TOPRule ; S --->NP VP (STATUS active} (CNTXTLORNOPR NIL) (PRODUCTION (S (NP VP))) (SYN-TESTS T) (SEM-TESTS T) (SYN-ACTIONS {ralaef \"({Subject Definiteness) Definiteness NP)","\"({Subject Number) Number NP)","\"{(Subject Predicate} Predicate NP)","\"{* * vP}}) [SEM-ACTIONS {put-sem-val ;stores the EVALuation of the following",";expression as the semantic value of the",";parent node S 39g","(append (getf-pn \"Predicate) {getf-pn \"{Subject Predicatel} (getl-pn \"(Object Predicate)) (getf-pn \"(Object-2 Predicate))))))","; getf-pn gets feature values from the parent node The graph built by the parser applying these rules to the sentence 'a girl handed the baby the toys' is equivalent to the e-structure built by the corresponding LFG as shown in/Wlnograd 1983/. The top node S contains the following feature structure: \" -Definiteness : Indefiniteq-Subject : Nmnber Singular |","Predicate Girl ._!

THE SAIL INTERFACING SYSTEM","The SAIL Interfacing System (S.I.S.) is the framework where a user can interact with SAIL in developing NL applications. In fact SIS is organized in Interface Levels (I.L.s): in SIS we commonly speak of Interface Level Applications (I.L.A.s) which are the association of an IL with a grammar. If IL-Name is the name of an IL, and G-Name is the name of a grammar which defines a particular language through a dictionary and a set of CGU rules, then the pair <IL-Name, G-Name> defines an 1LA inside the SIS: this application is a task performed by that particular IL. In this way the development environment is based on different layers of rules, which are processed by the same parser and can handle the external Interface, the particular application, and any request issued by the user. In fact, the grammar of an ILA defines a language which can be used by the user for sending to the system his requests so that are caught by the parsing system and immediately satisfied.","SIS is structured in 2 main ILs: the Kenael Interface Level (K.I.L.) and the Natural Language IL (N.L.I.L). When the system runs only two ILAs are active and available to the user: the KIL, associated to the Kernel Grammar (K.G.) and the Current Running Interface Level (C.R.I.L.). The KIL is always aetive because it is the core ILA of SIS and Its purpose Is to handle the overall system, so when the system Is started the user is introduced to the Kernel Interface Level. The Kernel Grammar is a semantic grammar associated with the KIL and defines a kernel language of commands and through them the user can use all the functionality of the system such as grammar building, parse checking, running other lI.As. When SAIL starts up, the KIL is also the CRIL, but when the user wants to load as CRIL another ILA defined In the system, for example a NLIL application, then a KIL command allows this and NLIL becomes the CRIL by loading a grammar associated to the NLIL: in this way the CRIL is updated to the new application and the loaded grammal becomes the current rumllng grammar. A subset of KIL commands defines a language through which the user can e~e the parsing structures generated by the parser for all the sentences input until that moment. This tool, named ANAPAR (ANAlysis of PARsing), is useful for the grammar and parse checking in deveh)ping NL applications, Finally, we want to point out that the particular structure given to ~IS enables the user to modify the front-end to SAIL by n mdifying the corresponding grammar of the KIL; in fact, all the files involved in their definition are accessible to the user who can modify those files as he wishes, or extend the language by introducing new gramma~ rules. CONCLUSIONS","The example has shown the possibility of implementing different grammar formalisms into the frame of SAIL and also the searching of standard procedures for building grammars in the CGU model starting feom Categorial Grammars is planned,","An experimental component has also been implemented, which performs some diagnosis of ill-formed input, and confirmed that the chosen parsing algorithm easily supports such a component.","A fuU evaluation of some of the described mechanisms (such as message passing) has not been carried yet, as application to real linguistic cases has not been designed, but theoretically.","However, a whole view of the system, and the described example show that SAIL is a valuable tool for the development of concrete grammars, even of large coverage.","The whole system described in this paper is currently implemented in Common Lisp and runs on Sun and Orion wockstations.","\"ITils work has been carried out within the framework of the ESPRIT Project P527 CFID (Conmmnlcation Failure in Dialogue: Techniques for Detection and Repair)."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","paragraphs":["The author is thankful to Giaeomo Ferrari and Irlna Prodanof for their helpful support.
