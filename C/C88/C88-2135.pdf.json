The formula is derived as a linear combination of tile surface characteristics of the text that are related to its readability: (1) the average number of characters per sentence, (2) for each type of characters (Roman alphabets, kanzis, hiraganas, katakanas), relative frequencies of rims (maximal swings) that ,:onsists only of that type of characters, (3) the average number of characters per each type of runs, and (4) tooten (comma) to kuten (period) ratio.","To find the proper weighting, principal component analysis (PCA) was appliedto these characteristics taken from 77 sample texts.","We have found a component which is related to the readability. Its scores match to the empirical knowledges of reading ease. We have also obtained experimental confirmation that the component is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of reading, by the cloze procedure and by the examination on the average lime taken to fill out one blank of the cloze texts. 1o Introduction","This study aims to obtain a readability formula that can be used by computer programs for style checking of Japanese texts. A readability formula predicts the difficulty of a document that may result from its writing style, but not from its content, organization, or format. A readability index is calculated from the measures of surface characteristics of the document that are thought to indicate the stylistic difficulty without an attempt to parse sentences or to consult a large dictionary.","Many of the readability formulae for English, (for example, Flesch's Reading Ease Score/Fleseh 1949/and Automated Readability Index/Smith 1970/), use the average length (number of syllables or lettors) of words and the average number of words in sentences in a document for calculating the readability index. Word length is a measure of the lexical difficulty, i.e., difficulty of the vocabulary used in the document. Sentence length is a measure of the Syntactic difficulty or complexity of the sentence. While reao dability indices are derived from simple formulae, they predict reasonably well the difficulty of a document. This is because the sentence length and the word length are highly correlated with features such as the complexity of the sentence and the difficulty of the word, respectively.","Existing scoring methods for Japanese, such as the one proposed by/Morioka 1958/or/Yasumoto 1983/, use the sentenco length measured in letters instead of words and the percentage of kanzis (Chinese characters), the latter used for estimating the difficulty of the vocabulary. Both rate the average number of letters per sentence and the percentage of kanzis in the text independen|ly and do not combine the two factors into a single index. A te~t with longer sentences is estimated as difficult, and a text with more kanzis is also estimated as difficult. Morioka, who surveyed on school textbooks, showed that the upper grade textbooks contain longer sentences on the average and more kanzi. Yasumoto states that documents with more kanzi are less readable even for adults, for the following reason. Kanzi are logograms, one roughly corresponding to a word. Documents using more kanzis, therefore, apt to include more different words and should demand more reading skill.","A problem of rating the sentence length and the percentage of kanzi independently is that these two may yield an inconsistent rating. Generally, a sentence becomes longer if its kanzis are rewritten in kanas. Thus sentence lengths depend on representations. There seems to have been no attempt on combining the factors of sentence length and the proportion of kanzi. On the other hand, no rationale is given for the separate measurements. It is possible to derive a single index that can assess readability of Japanese text.","/Sakamoto 1967/proposed a method of scoring the relative difficulty of children's books to match the reading skill of the intended readers. His method consists of three independent ratings; (1) the proportion of fundamental words based on/Sakamoto 1958/, (2) the proportion of sentences that are made of more than 10 words, and (3) the proportion of kanzi. However, Sakamoto's method introduce the problem of measuring sentence length in words in place of tile conflict between sentence length and representation.","Using word count o1' word length as an estimator of readability is not practical in the case of Japanese. Since Japanese does not use word segmentations in nomaal writing, dividing sentences into words needs parsing and consulting dictionary. Thus, a scoring method based on words, such as Sakamoto's, is costly. This is especially so when scoring is done by a computer, because extra devices such as parsers, a large dictionary, and, sometimes, semantic analyzers are required for word segmentation alone.","Another problem with the traditional scoring methods is that they have ignored katakana, which are used to represent foreign words. Recent documents, especially scientific and technical ones, use a lot of foreign words. /Watanabe 1983/reports that, in a year's issues of the Jonrual of lnfonnation Processing Society of Japan, Vol. 17, about an eighth among the characters used is katakana. /Satake 1982/surveyed the article of magazines published today and found that the ratio of katakana ranged from 4.44 to 13.75 percent. Thus percentage of katakana is not negligible in scoring today's documents. Katakana words mean imported foreign words, old and new, which are often unfamiliar to readers. Yet existing measures take into account only kanzi and are insufficient to score the today's technically oriented documents."]},{"title":"2. Factors of Readability","paragraphs":["We have chosen the following four surface characteristics as factors of readability: (1) relative frequency of characters for each type of characters, (2) the length of a run (maximal string that consists of one type","of characters),. (3) the length of a sentence, and (4) the number of tooten s (commas) per sentence.","The former two are related to the difficulty of vocabulary in a document; the latter two are related to the complexity of sentences in a document. 649 Character Frequencies","The most common Japanese writing system is based on the mixture of"]},{"title":"kanzis, kanas (hiraganas","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"katakanas),","paragraphs":["the Roman alphabets, Arabic numerals, and some other alphabets and symbols. Almost al! normal writing is a mixture of kanzis, hiraganas, and katakanas (and others). Frequencies of types of characters in a Japanese text are known to affect its readability at least in the following manner: Kanzi, as mentioned before, are considered to make texts difficult. Since katakana and alphabets are used for foreign words, high frequencies of these characters indicate that the text contain many unfamiliar words. Hiragana are used to represent the rest of the text and more of them are considered to make texts easier. There is no rigid orthography for Japanese. Nevertheless, the way an adult Japanese spells out a sentence in usual writing is roughly fixed. Kanzis are used for nouns and for the root parts of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and the like. Hiraganas are used to write inflections and other grammatical parts of sentences, and katakanas are used mainly for the transcription of foreign words. So in passages written in the common way, the use of types of characters, i.e., kanzi, hiragana, katakana, etc., reflects the use of vocabulary and can be an' indicator of the difficulty of the passage.","It is possible to write the words usually written in kanzi in hiragana. However, psychological experiments such as the ones conducted by /Kitao 1960/ or /Hirose 1983/ a reader finds it difficult to read the texts represented in the way unfamiliar to the reader. In Kitao's experiment, subjects took less time to read and recognize the word or the sentence written in a common way than written solely in hiragana. In Hirose's experiment, the words usually written in kanzi are harder to recognize than the words usually written in kana when both type of words are written in kana. Both results show that words or sentences in the representation more","- familiar to a reader are more readable than those in less familiar representation. Runs","In the ordinary representation, a boundary of the types of characters corresponds to the boundary of words or smaller grammatical parts thereof. That is, a series of letters of the same type in the text, bounded by other character types corresponds to a word or a smaller grammatical part. We will call such a series a"]},{"title":"run,","paragraphs":["i.e., a run is a maximal string that consists of only one type of characters. It is not a grammatical unit. Usually, a run corresponds to one or more words. A verb or an adjective is often found across two runs. Such a word norulally has its root part written in kanzi and its inflection part in hiragana.","As the boundary of runs roughly correspond to the boundary of words, the different graphic appearance of kanzi and kana letters helps a reader to parse a sentence. Hence, long runs, when they happen, hide the word boundaries and makes a sentence less readable.","Long kanzi runs give another problem to the readability. Kango. can be formed into a compound word simply by concatenating two or more of them successively. The meaning of the new word is formed by the meanings of its elements. However, how each element is related to each other in the compound word is not clear from mere concatenation. A reader must pragmatically"]},{"title":"see","paragraphs":["the relation.

Nevertheless, the run frequencies may be used in a similar manner as character frequencies. In a study preceding this/Tateisi 1987/ we found that the run frequencies are correlated with the frequencies of the character of corresponding types (0.6 < r < 0.9, depend-ing on character types) and a unit of run is sufficient to obtain the information otherwise supplied by both characters and runs."]},{"title":"Sentence Length","paragraphs":["The length of sentences is a known factor of readability as /Morioka 1958/and other surveys show. In Japanese, as in other languages, long sentences tend to have complicated structures.","Sentence length can be measured in the number of characters it contains. Though Sakamoto's survey of children's textbook /Sakamoto 1963/shows that the number of words per sentences is a more accurate indicator of the grade level than the number of characters, it also shows that the two are in good proportion, the correlation coefficient being 1.00."]},{"title":"Punctuation Tootens,","paragraphs":["like commas, are put at the end of a phrase. The number of tootens per sentence corresponds to the number of phrases per sentence. /Hayasi 1959/found that junior high school sU:dents and senior high students understood the text more precisely if modifying phrases are separated and made into independent sentences. Following this result, a sentence with smaller number of phrase is easier to understand. /Kozuru 1987/ found that the average number of tootens in a sentence increases with student's grade level. These findings indicate that the number of tootens in a sentence is greater in more difficult-to-read texts. Thus, the number of tootens is a factor of readability."]},{"title":"3. The Method of Analysis","paragraphs":["We shall first extract several numerical characteristics of style from texts and then derive a readability formula as a linear combination of the values of those characteristics. A nurflerical index is only a rough scale of readability. It should be calculated with simple devices and methods. We use character as the unit of measuring length for the sake of simple calculation.","Several surface characteristics are extracted from the materials. Difference of the characteristics among materials consists of several factors. It may be factored into variation of the topic area of the texts, and the variation of style. Style may differ by the writer or by the intentions of the text. Introductory textbooks should be written easier than technical papers intended for experts and the authors will be careful not to make it difficult to read. Thus they will be written in a style easier to read than the style of technical papers. Translations tend to have a particular style, highly dependent on the syntax of the original language. The particular style of translations is often found awkward as Japanese and less readable. The distinctive feature of the texts with different intentions can be used as a criteria of assessing readability.","To find the distinctive feature of texts from the surface characteristics, the principal component analysis (PCA) extracts factors of variance of the characteristics. We will then examine tile components, by comparing component scores for the materials with the empirical knowledges of readability. In this way we shall choose a component relevant to the stylistic readability. A principal component is a linear combination of the variables.

Kuten, unlike period, is placed only at the end of a sentence, not as an indicator of abbreviations. Therefore, the end of a sentence is ahnost always detected by detecting kuten, although the end quotation embedded in a sentence is also counted as the end of a sentence."]},{"title":"Samples","paragraphs":["We must compare the readability anaong the texts written in tile common way, that is, the texts written by authors as they are.

Seventy of the samples are machine-readable documents that were stored in our laboratory.

Five of these indicators a~e text judged as easy. Three of therft are taken from the books on technical writing; two are taken from essays for general readers. They are considered to be easier than the papers or textbooks for scientists. The remaining two are the text judged as difficult.

For example, mirareru may mean either be seen (passive) o1' can see (potential) and taberareru may have one of three meanings: be eaten, can eat, and can be eaten.

This agrees with the observation that the second component score is lower on difficult-to-read texts and that the frequency of passives is higher on such texts.","Figure 5-1 shows the plot of the second component scores and the frequencies of passives per 1000 sentences. The line in the figure is the regression line. 651 6. The Derived Formula","The results above support the adequacy of the second component as a scale of readability. To summarize, the second component score may be used as a readability index because of the following facts. (1) The component score agrees with human judgement about","easy/difficult texts. Easier-to-read texts yield higher valued","scores. (2) Introductory materials give higher scores than technical","papers, (3) The score increases as the result of improvement by editing","of texts, (4) The frequencies of passive forms have a negative correlation","(-0.53) with the component score. The first component and the third component do not possess all of these properties. Thus the second is a better measure of readability than the first or the third.","The second component score is transformed so that the mean on those 77 samples equals 50, the standard deviation equals 10, and let the value be higher on easy texts. This yields formula, RS = 0.06 xpa + 0.25 xph - 0.19 xpc - 0.61 xpk -1.34 x Is -1.35 x la + 7.52 x lh - 22.1 × lc - 5.3 x lk -3.87 x cp - 109.1 where pa, ph, pc, pk are the percentages of alphabet runs, hiragana runs, kanzi runs, and katakana mns, respectively; Is is the average numbers of letters per sentence; la, lh, lc, Ik are the average numbers of letters per alphabet run, hiragana run, kanzi run, and katakana run, respectively;and cp is the tooten to kuten ratio. 7. Validation of the Derived Formula","We have also obtained experimental conformation on the idea that the RS is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of reading, by the cloze procedure/Taylor 1953/,/Shiba 1957/.","Cloze procedure judges the relative reading difficulty of texts to a particular population. This difficulty mostly related to the content of the text. Suppose readers have no background knowledge of the content. They are not likely to be able to fill a blanked-out word where a technical term or some other word that requires the knowledge of the area the content belongs to be filled in. In such cases, the cloze score or the doze percentage becomes low for the text even if an experts finds it very easy to read.","Stylistic difficulty may be also measured by this procedure, according to the experiment of ]Kitao 1960/. In the experiment subsequent to the one mentioned in the previous section, he required the subjects to perform the cloze procedure on two materials; the same text represented in two different ways. One is in the usual representation, mixing kanzi and kana; the other is written entirely in hiragana. The cloze score of the usual form was higher than the one entirely in kana. This result was consistent with the result that the subjects required longer time in reading the text entirely in kana, as mentioned in section 2.","As the cloze procedure scores both the difficulty of style and the difficulty of the content, another measure is needed to confirm that our formula is a measure of the stylistic readability. For this purpose, we recorded the total time each subject took to complete a cloze text. The recorded time was divided by the number of blanks, thus converted into the average time taken to fill out one blank.","The process a subject takes to fill out a blank is composed of four phases, i.e., 652 (1) the phase of reading the incomplete text and understand the","content of the passage, (2) the phase of surmising what is missing (as a notion), (3) the phase of choosing the proper word to supplement, and (4) the phase of writing down that word. The time for writing down a word is fairly constant, unless the word contains extremely complicated kanzi. Therefore, the variation of time from text to text is the variation of time for the phase (1), (2), and (3), i.e., understanding the passage, surmising the missing notion, and choosing the proper word. The text which is stylistically difficult takes more time in the phase (1). Thus the difficult-to-read texts must require more time filling out blanks than easy-to-read ones. Materials","The materials of the experiment, denoted by p 1 through p 6, were taken from the six sample papers among the 77 used for the PCA. Each was about 500 characters in size. Three of them (p 1, p 2, p 3) had high RS s (RS > 50) and the three (p 4, p 5, a 6) had low RS s (RS < 50).","Every eighth word of each text was blanked out, i.e., the proportion of blanked out words to the whole words was 12.5%. Ten underscore ('_') characters were put where a word was blanked out. Among several different definitions of Japanese words used, the one which gives the smallest unit was taken. The materials were printed out on a sheet of A4-sized paper, one material per paper.","Twenty-eight subjects (25 undergraduate students and 3 graduate students) participated in the experiment. Each subject was assigned three materials fi~m p 1 -p 6 selected randomly, so that the half of the subjects were assigned each material. The subjects were required to fill blanks (underscored parts) with words they thought most appropriate to the context, taking as much time they need. The subjects were told that each word-unit was smallest possible, and therefore the deleted part might not match what they think is a word. The subjects were also told that the materials that they had were independent from each other.","At the same time, the subjects were required to record the time when he/she start to fill out each paper, i.e., one material, and when he/she completed, for each paper, to the unit of seconds. Results","Completed sheets, expect for one by a subject who gave up the procedure in the middle are analyzed. Whether the word filled in matched the original or not was judged according to /Shiba 1957/. Some sheets are without the record of the time. Such sheets are included for calculation of doze pereen[ages but excluded from the analysis of time. The eloze percentages and the medians of the time taken to fill a blank are shown in table 7-1. The cloze percentages were higher on texts with higher RS, although the correlation was not statistically significant (the correlation coefficient between cloze percentages and RS s is 0.295).","For the analysis of time taken, the texts were divided into two categories; the ones with RS > 50 and the ones with RS < 50. The average time for filling a blank was compared between the two categories of the texts using the median test. The result is shown in table 7-2. The difference of the time for filling a blank is shorter on texts with high RS s.","In addition, we compared a document and its rewritten version by the same procedure. The material r 1 was taken from the final report of rinzi-kyouiku-singikai (National Council of Educational Reform) of Japanese Government. The document r 1 had an extremely low score (RS = 27). The material r2 was rewritten from r 1 by di¢iding long sentences into shorter sentences and substituting Japanese words for words of Chinese origin. The inte.u-tion of the rewriting is to increase RS. The RS of the rewritten text is 47, nearly the average of the sample texts of PCA (= 5(I). The cloze percentage and the average time for flling a blank is compm'ed con(pared as above. The cloze percentage of rite rewritten version r2 was 59.6 %, higher than that of the original r 1 (56.6 %). The average time for billing a blank is shorter for the rewritten version than for the original (the mexlian was 9.6 sec. for r2 and 10.9 see. for r 1). The median test of time eompadug the two materials showed that the difference was not statistically significant ()~:~ :- 0).","These ret;ults show that (1) the subjects take shorter time with the texts of higher RS in","understanding and guessing the nfissing words of the text,","than wilh the text of lower RS, though the result is not statist-","ieally significant, and that (2) the subjt:cts guess the missing words in the high RS texts","more co~ cectly than those in the low RS texts. The difi'erenee il~ time a subjecl spent to fill one blank in the two types of texts is significant, by the median test.","These rcudts did not show that RS is related to the difficulty of the content or the vocabulary of the texts, ttowever, RS is related to the stylistic difiiculty, that is, RS show the ~vlative difficulty of {:mnsfb,mation from the text itself to the content. Therefore, RS is judged useful to measure the readability of texts in general.","We judged that the clozc score is more relatexl to the difficulty of the content than to the difficulty of the style.

Concluding Remarks","We have: derived a readability formula ti'orh the multivariate analysis on wtriance of surface characteristics of Japanese technical documents intended for adult readers. The mean, file minimum, and the maximum v'alue of RS over the several types of texts are shown in table 8-.1.","As with all indices, RS can be increased by revision which dues not necessarily enhance readability. For example, if a text is written entirely in hiragana and the sentences are cut into short shorter ones, lh and ph increases and Is decreases. This revision yields greater value of RS but does not produce the text easier to read. The formula shmdd be applied to the texts written in the common way To construct an index that is sensitive to the unreadability caused by unusually many ldraganas0 we may neeA a qua° dratic formula on hiragana rim length or hiragana run frequencies.
