Central to these principles is a distinction between phases and periods together with the temporal hierarchy, where multiple scales of time and relations can be expressed. A system, CLOCKWISE, has been implemented which interprets Swedish temporal expressions according to the principles outlined in the paper. Introduction Temporal information is expressed and conveyed in a number of ways in natural language including tense, aspect and lexical items that carry temporal information, eg. temporal adverbs. Most researchers in this field approach temporal entities in language from the perspective of tense and aspect. But there is very little in the literature on other expressions that hold temporal information, such as temporal adverbs, certain prepositional phrases and noun phrases. In most papers the meaning of a temporal adverbial such as 'next year' is merely explained as the predicate 'next year' which specifies a point or interval of time from a reference time. In objective time-modelling systems such as/Kahn & Gorry 1977/and/Bruce 1973/ temporal expressions were never analyzed in their linguistic form; instead they had to be typed in as stereotyped lists. The internal structure of temporal expressions must be investigated in order to construct grammars that can capture general features and be of use in computational applications. In the paper I will focus on temporal frame-adverbial phrases, that is, expressions that refer to a temporal period in which events are located (Cf /Bennet& Partee 1978/,/Hinrichs 1986/). I will not discuss the complex question of how tense, aspect and temporal adverbials interact (for an outline of the problems see/Ejerhed 1987D."]},{"title":"TemPoral frame.adverbial phrases","paragraphs":["A large group of temporal expressions can be classified as frame-adverbial phrases. /Smith 1981/ categorizes temporal frame-adverbial phrases in the following way1: Deictic Clock-Calendar 2 Dependent - last week, yesterday - at midnight = now, this moment + next week, tomorrow + at midnight - previously, before = the same time + later, afterwards 1 My use of + and - is the same as Smith's forward and backward arrows. 2 In an earlier paper (Smith 1980) Smith calls this class flexible anchoring adverbials. This classification is based on the concept of anchoring, ie. a deictic is generally anchored to the time of speech (ST), a dependent is anchored to another given time in the context, and a clock calendar adverbial can anchor to either ST or to some other context-dependent time. Smith attributes a relational value to these expressions, -, = and +. These symbols stand in turn for the relational value anteriority (past), simultaneity (present) and posteriority (future). Frame-adverbials can syntactically occur as adverbs, noun phrases and prepositional phrases. They can be complex expressions such as (1) On Monday next week at 6 pro. where temporal information is specified on several levels and we have a combination of deictic and clock calendar expreso sions, Complex expressions have a relatively loose syntax in that the time denoted in (1) can be expressed as (2) and (3) (2) Next week on Monday at 6 pm. (3) At 6 pm next week on Monday. The issues that need considering are the following: How is the semantic well-formedness of frame-adverbial phrases determined and, if possible, what is needed to establish their temporal reference in terms of locations on the time axis."]},{"title":"Periods and phases","paragraphs":["To account for the semantic well-formedness of flame-adverbial phrases the 'time' denoted by the phrase can be thought of as an ordered set of specifications for conventional temporal concepts, such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND. The ordering of these temporal concepts may seem to fit well into a 'Chinese box metaphor' where each concept is ~ included in a concept on a higher level and in turn includes a concept on a lower level. A semantically well-formed temporal frame-adverbial would then be described as a phrase which forms a description of an unbroken chain of temporal concepts. This is put forward by/Hinriehs 1986/in his Scoreboard of reference points and cooccurence restriction in which the construction of a reference time from a flame-adverbial phrase is possible if there is a chain of specified temporal concepts in accordance with an ordered set of concepts. However, if we included WEEK in the above set of concepts we would get into trouble. Weeks are not included in months in the same way as months are included in years and a problem of where to fit in WEEK in the Chinese box order would occur. This is due to the fact that the western calendar system is based on three sepao rate descriptive traditions: the week, the Gregorian calendar and the clock/Levy 1980/. The Gregorian calendar holds year, month and day(of month) as its basic concepts, the week is a sequence of named days, and the clock system divides the day into hours and hours into seconds, etc. The week and Gregorian calendar share the concept of day and the clock 426 system split.~ the day into time segments. The reason that we can express a time by specifying different concepts of separate systems is that the systems share one or more concepts with each other, tlt is also reflected in the way we refer to the day period (in S ~vedish and English). A day can be referred to in two different ways, either by specifying the day of a certain week (DW) or by picking out a day of a certain month (DATE). In English the expression on Monday next week will describe the same day on the time axis as an expression describing the same day by specifying a year, a month and a day of month. In Swedish it is possible to specify a mfique day by the year-week-day path as the Swedish calendar has numbered weeks, giving us a year divided into 53 weeks 3. In our model we want to distinguish between periods and phases and ~;how the relations between them. A period P is a segment of time with a certain length, such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY, WEEK, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOlqD. A l)eri~×l Pi is a subperiod of a pecind P iff 1\" can be seen as consisting of a number of periods Pi that togeflmr exhaust I'. A phase p is a specific instance of a snbperiod having a eeltain order ia tire sequence of subperiods cxhaustillg a given period P. For example, a period such as YEAR can be seen as consisting of twelw+ subperiods (MONTH). January is the first phase of those twelve subperiods. The graph below illustrates the relation between year as a period and the monthly phases. '~ ........ YEAR ..... Fig. 1 The YEAR period This graph shows the year period from one point of view. We could split the year into other phases, for' instance, into periods of seasons, where summer, autumn, winter and spring would be the corresponding phases. Note that a sequence of phases is cyclically lecurring. Apart fi'c,m differentiating periods and phases we must be able to show the ,'elations between them, The following table shows some period:; with corresponding phases: YEP,R: CALENDAR {...0...} MONTD.: YEAR { Janmtry,...Dec ember } WEEK: YEAR { 1, 2, ...53 } DA'~(: MONTH","(DATE) { l, 2,..31 }","WEEK","(I)W) {Monday,...Sunday/ HOUR: DAY {0, 1,...23 } MINUTE: HOUR {0, l, ...59} SECONI:): MINUTE { 0,1, ._59 } 3 One could say that the system of numberexl weeks is similar to file, use of named months or named days. The analogy does not ho:Ld Idt the way of course as the week system is historically indel~mdent from the Gregoriau calendar, but we have 'tried' to force the week concept onto the concept of year by naming the weeks with numbers. In Sweden a umubered week always slarls on a Monday. The first week that holds at least four days of a new year forms week 1. Tire first of January 1987 was a qhursday and pint of week 1, whereas the first of January 1988 is a Friday which :esults in the first three days of 1988 being part of week 53 19811 This is standardized by Swedish authorities. Fox each period there are one or two possibilities to view it as a subpefiod of a higher-level period. The difference between the two different ways of referring to a DAY period is shown by the fact that there are two subperiod-of relations, one to MONTH, and one to WEEK. The subperiod-of relations can be displayed in a temporal hierarchy of lhe following kind. YEAR","................ ...... nour~of-day Fig. 2 The temporal hierarchy The lines connecting temporal periods to each other show subperiod-.of relations. The hierarchy shows the two diflerent paths fi'om YEAR to DAY. :The periods and phases described above share one property and that is that they all have fixed lengths and as a consequence clear boundaries. We can easily locate the point on the time axis where January becomes February, but we cannot with accuracy specify the location on the time axis where spring is succeeded by summer. So we must distinguish be- - tween bounded and fuzzy periods. There are other phasal divi-- sions one can make. For example, we could split the week into weekdays and non-weekdays (week-ends?), and tim year :into feasts, such as Christmas and Easter, and non-feasts, etc. It is just a matter of fact that we divide time into different temporal scales, and some contain periods of fixed length and some do not. This is why it is problematic to try and map a phase of no fixed length, such as summer, onto another temporal scale where we are dealing with fixed boundaries sueb as the one depicted in the temporal hierarchy above. Durative expressions are mostly expressed in terans of quanti-- fied periods: one week, two months, three years, etc. It is more seldom that phasal expressions are used in a durative sense. Quantified phasal expressions such as two mornings, six Thursdays, three winters, etc are primarily used to express habituality and iteration. It is however possible to infer duration fl'om these as we know the length of a phase or can infer it from its corresponding period. Phasal and deictic expressions In accordance with the previous section we can now distinguish between phasal and deictic expressions. In our terminology a phasal expression is a temporal expression that primarily describes a phase by using a corresponding word for the phase in question. A phasal expression may be, a single word (1988, January, midnight) or be more complex, such as a prepositional phrase (in 1988, in January, at midnighO. 427 The difference between Smith's clock calendar adverbials /Smith 1981/ and phasal expressions is that phasal expressions are just \"providers of phases\" and they are not primarily anchored to any other time as clock calendar adverbials are. Phasal expressions may describe absolute times if they refer to a unique phase on the time axis. So if the phasal expression"]},{"title":"1987","paragraphs":["denotes a"]},{"title":"unique","paragraphs":["phase of the calendar then it is possible to map it into an absolute time.

Deictic expressions function basically in the following way: Starting from a reference time (eg. ST) a deictic will establish a new reference time with a different phasal value for the relevant period by moving a number of steps in either a forward (+) or a backward (-) direction depending on the deictic, and keeping phasal values for higher-level periods consistent with this change.

Interpretation principle","paragraphs":["By looking at the properties of the different parts of a complex temporal expression interpretation principles for frame-adverbial expressions can now be set up. Making use of the distinction between the deietic and phasal expressions together with the temporal hierarchy we can outline a Frame-adverbial interpretation principle which will explain when a frame-adverbial expression is interpretable: It is possible to interpret a temporal frmne-adverbial phrase autanomcusly iff","1. a) ] he phrase consist8 of olin or several phasal expressions and b) 't'he eombimttion of phasal values wilt constitut~ a chain of 1,3mpot-al infonnafi(m according to the icmpmal hierarchy. and c) ')'he top-most phase of the chain specifies a unique phase.","or","2. a) 'Yhe phrase con~;ists of a combhlation of one or several deieties and an arbitrtay numbes of phasal expressions and b) hMex is lmown for each deictic ~mt~ e) 'the deietics and the phasal expressions each specify consistent phase-of relations. The phasal values provided will constitnte a ch~,in of temlm~al infommtion according to rim tcmlmmI hierarchy. IRt( ( d) A ddctic provides tonporal information for the highest level of the chain. The abow: principle will permit intc~pretation of expressions such as O) (2) 1987 i maj den 24 maj 1987 i mo/gon kl kvart Over' fyra ngtsh~ reeks pd torsdag kl",".~vart 6vet fyra for 20 dr sedan idag rid den htir tiden i morgon 1987 in May May 24th, 1987 tomorrow at a quartet' past four ~ext week on l\"hursday at","a quarter past four 20 years ago today at this time tomorrow","fSr 39 dr\" och fyra t*~m~der sedaza 39 years and four ~umths ago","om t,M veckor oeh fyra dagar in two weeks and four days The following expressions will be ruleA out by the principle: (3) kl kvart i~ver 5 1987 at a q~tarter past Jive 1987 pd kvdllen i jnnua~i in the evening in Januacy (4) fOrra dret pd eftermiddagen last year in the afternoon nasta recks k112 next week at nvelve o' clock The fact that an expression i.,; ruled out by the principle does not mean that into'pretation is blocked completely. The expressions in (3) and (4) are only incomplete in the sense that some perk,ds lack a phasal value and it may turn out that contextual knowledge will provide this. Inteq~retation is stack if the expression yields inconsistent phasal values. For example, the expression pd mdndagen den 23 november i dr (on Momqay Novembe~ 23rd this year) provides inconsistent phasal values for the I)AY period, ie. November 23rd i,~ a Wednesday in 1988. However, there are some borderline cases that the above principle would permit such a,q","(5) for .39 dr sedan ig& n~'~a reeks n&~ta dr for 2 ar sedan fOr 2 nu~uuler sedan","(6) for 39 & sedan i ~u~rgon om s,.x dr fOr 2 mdnader se&m 39 ),ears ago yesterday next week next year two years ago two months ago 39 year's ago tomorrow in six years 2 months ago [n (5) two deictics with the same direction are combined, either + +, or .... . And in (6) there is a combination of deictics with different relational values, that is an anterior is joined with a posterior deictic. In principle it seems possible to combine de-- ictics in this way, although some Swedish speakers do con-. sider the examples in (5) and (6) as being odd. The examples in (5) and (6) are all complex frame-adverllial expression holding more than one deictic phrase, but the im-- portant thing is that the different deictics together specify the same tinre. In other words, if we interpret a phrase such as (7)fiOr tvd dr sedan igdr (two years ago yesterday) where the two involved deictics both have ST as obligatory in-dex the first deietic will pick out a description of a reference time two years before ST and the second will modify that description by adding phases for DAY and MONTH based on the partial description of a phase one day before ST. This view makes it possible to claim that certain deictics such as igdr (yesterday), i morgon (tomorrow), ete, always have ST as their index. /Smith 1978/ has proposed that interpretation of expressions such as (7) is done in two steps, that is, that the first deictic forms the RT for tile second. Smith's strategy would mean that igdr (yesterday) in (7) cannot have ST as its obligatory index; with our strategy this is indeed possible. hnplementations The principles outlined for the interpretation of temporal I~'amc-adverbials have been implemented in a system, CLOCKWISE, which interprets frame-adverbial expressions into a temporal description in terms of phasal wdues. Tht: first version of CI,OCKWISE consists of a parser, based on finite ~';tatc machinery, and a 'temporal expert' that will make use of its knowledge about temporal phases and periods and infer temporal information that is missing explicitly in the expressicms. A temporal representation is constructed in a notepad dm'ing the parsing process. The notepad contains information about the periods and phases denoted by the expression and~ if the expression is deictic, also index, step value and direction. Thc notepad is structured according to the temporal hierarchy and will therefore support the interpreter according to the l,lterpretation principle. The first version can, however, only deal with one type of index, namely speech time. CI_,OCKWISI-!, 1 has been usexl as a module in a natural language and graphi-- cal interface to a booking system/J6nsson 1987/. The second version of CLOCKWISE is under construction. The temporal representation is built by an LFG-type gimmnar to gether with a frame-based knowledge representation whmv temporal periods and phases am treated as semantic objects (of /Ahrenberg 1988/. The grammm\" is written in a way to syntactically filter out file temporal expressions, ie. temporal prepositional phrases are functionally distinct front other prepositional phrases in the functional structures (fstructures). The result of a successful interpretation of a temporal frame-adverbial is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where a set of phasal values forms a description of the time denoted by the expression. For example, a frame-adverbial such as niista vecka pd fredag kl 12.30 (next week on Friday at 12.30) has a functional structure of the following kind: 429 TEMP","IioLEX $WEEK ]] RD IN.~STA] [ ASE UNM 31 FORM UNM ]J"]},{"title":"[-PCASE .,A ] E","paragraphs":["LEX SFREDA~ EGEND UTR 3"]},{"title":"EcAsE","paragraphs":["~EX {$HOUR12 $MINUTE303"]},{"title":"Fig. 3 Functional structure","paragraphs":["The above DAG is mapped to an intermediate DAG by the Frame system.
