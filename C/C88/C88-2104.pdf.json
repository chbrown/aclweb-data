Later , it shows its necessity in number of synt~ctic constructs , such as passivization, extraposi- -[;Jon , coordination etc. But ~ddlng such fea~ ture is not understood as a mere technicalit.~ , an~ thus some implications for the explan~vtor)< power of the theory are also discusse(! o 1. Remarks on the Notation of PP","T}~e notion of Prepositional Phrase has a fJ. rm and long standing tradition in the An~ /:J o-.laxor, linguistic framework , including r~P[~C~. The classical Continental tradition, on the other h~ind, does not use this term for ]~nf<uage description in majority of frame- ~.;or]:s developed and treats prepositions pre-4omJnantl,v as markers of nouns. In this pay, er, I will adhere to this approach.","The most important reason for doing this is the fact ~hat , on the assumption of existence of PP, it is impossible to generate s~ich sentences as (1) in the GPSG context.- free framework.","(I) I went there with John and with Paul, who met each other before. The point is, that in (I), on the assumption ~f the existence of PP, we find a PP-coordi-- r~tion, resulting in a PP, rather than an NP one. Consequently, the relative clause must be sister of this PP rather than of an NP. lint this is (at ].east in my opinion) hardly a~ acceptable solution, both intuitively and formally. Even an attempt to cope with this oroblom by means of rightward \"Across-the-Poard\" extraposition would not make things better, since such a solution would presume phrases as \"John who met each other\" to be correct English NP's. I do not wish to pursue this further here, the problem is more thoroughly described in (01iva,88) from both intuitive and formal viewpoints. What I really wanted to do was to motivate the decision of avoiding the term PP in this paper (and, possibly, the necessity of omitting it from the CPSG framewor]e altogether), which will be reflected in the notation of rules. Thus , assuming otherwise the notation familiar from (Oazdar,Klein,Pullum and Sag,85) , the category PP"]},{"title":"{[PFOR~ z]}","paragraphs":["will he reoasted as ~Pf[PREP z ]} , which should road as \"NP marked with preposition ~ \" As a special value of the feature PREP, the value \"nil\" ought to be introduced, with the meaning that there is no preposition marking the NP in question (i.e., the category NP~[PREP nil]} in the new 494 notation is exactly equivalent to the simple NP in the notation of (Gazdar ,~(lein ,Pullum and Sag ,85)). 2° The Szn__tactic Function Feature","In this paper, I shall try to show some of the problems connected with omitting the traditional notion of (syntactic) function in GPSG, and their possible solutions°","The payoffs of the notion mentioned can be seen e.g. on the classification of adver-~ bials: each adverbial modifier, whether expressed by an NP {PREP} , by an adverb, by a subordinated clause or otherwise, has its more specific meaning (\"function\") in the sentence. With specific lexlcal units, e.g. with the verb \"put\", this is so obvious that a \"semantic\" classification was proposed even in some of the syntactical approaches, cfo (Bresnan and Grimshaw,78), and later transferred into GPSG without change, as can be seen on the presence of the feature L0C and related lexical rule introducing \"put\" (2). (2) VP----~ H[6] ,NP,PP[+LOC} Further, two more such features, viz. MANNER and TEMP, were, unfortunately again with no systematic motivation, proposed as \"possible solution\" for some problems of coordination in (Sag,Gazdar,Wasow and Weisler,85). These features LOC,MANNER,TEZP are, of course, no-thing else than function markers on adverbial modifiers (of location, of manner, of time)°","Now the time has come to introdfice these modifiers more systematically; but I add two arguments in favour of such systemization before. First, the rule (2), explicitly stipulating the complement as PP (or, alternatively, as NP {PREP] ) , does not provide the theory with the power to generate any of (3).","(3)a. I have put my spectacles somewhere,","but now I cannot recall where it was. b. She put it where I wanted it. The second argument comes again from coordi-- nation; neither under the traditional \"categorial harmony\" nor under the newly proposed theory of (Sag,Gazdar,Wasow and Weisler,85), the contrast in (4) could be explained.","(4) a. She was killed by her husband","and by his mistress.","bo She was killed by a hammer","and by an axe.","c. *She was killed by her husband","and by a hammer. Under the \"functional\" approach, however, we find in (4)a the coordination of a_~nts (\"deep subjects\"), in (4)b the coordination of instruments; but in (4)c an attempt to coordinate a~ and instrument is involved, which makes this string ungrammatical.","Thus, it seems to be advantageous to add one more item to the feature system of GPSG, namely the feature of function (let it be called FUNC, hence) of the phrase in the sentence. Its values will mark the adverbial modifiers of place (lee), direction (dir), manner (mod), instrument (instr), purpose (purp), ss well as other functions of phrases, such as subject (subj), direct object (dobJ), indirect object (iobj), predicative (prd), resu]t (eff), agent of passive sentences (ag) etc., as is usual in the Prague Linguistic School. Further, the example (4) and the related discussion guides us to add FUNC to the set of Head-features.","Next, we shall consider the following triads o~ examples, all generated by the standard GPSG grammar.

The second observation %o be made is by far more important in its scope: from the comparison of examples (25)a vs. (25)b and (26)a vs. (26)b, it i.s clear that the role of constituent having some function in the sentence can be played only by a fuli/f__~eeified phrase of the appropriate type (i.e., in (25), the role of (sentential) subject by a sentence containing \"that\"-complement, in (26), the role of (prepositional) object by a noun phrase containing the concerned preposition). And the same holds also vice versa, i.e. no underspeclfied phrase can play the role of the constituent having the function in question. In other words, whenever the complement or preposition is expan.- ded in the generation process, the \"rest\" of the phrase must not be any more marked as having the function the \"whole\" phrase has.

Conclusions","It was shown that a new feature denoting syntactic function of a phrase should probably be added to the feature system of GPSG, which will help make the theory more adequate. This feature proved to be useful not only in some technicalities, but even in the intuitive and explanatory background of the theory. The bulk of support material for this new feature was taken from passiviza- %ion of constructions with direct object in this paper, but similar evidence for the new feature can be drawn also from other types of passivization (of constructions with indirect objects, p:ceposltional complements (\"A doctor was sent for.\") or adjuncts (\"This bed has been slept in.\")), as well as from other types of extraposition (cf. the impossibility of generating sentences like \"It w~s hoped by everybody that he would sing.\" in the standard GPSG) and yet other sources.","Adding the syntactic function feature to \"the GPSG (mete)grammar goes in certain as-pects in parallel with the independently motivated efforts to eliminate metarules from GPSG altogether and/or to shift their work to lexical redundancy rules, e.g. (Pollard,85), (Kilbury,86). This fact only confirms the old wisdom that, given some linguistic information, the Question of dividing it between grammar and lexicon may be decided rather arbitrarily. The i~ortant point is that the proposals made here do not require such radical changes in the GPSG framework as the \"lexlcal\" approaches do, i.e., they keep better the basic spirit of the current GPSG (while solving the problems shown at least equally well). The only points in which a really substantial change occurred in this paper was, first, the structure of PP, and, second, the stipulation that purely morphological characteristics of constituents is insufficient for the description of English syntax. Put I hope that in the light of the data presented these moves appear to be fully Justified.

Consequently, such verbs as \"bother\" must be listed in the lexicon twice', each time with different subcategorizatlon class, but in both cases subcategorlzing fox' identical complements (and, hence, there have to be two almost identical lexical rules in the grammar, one for each of the classes).
