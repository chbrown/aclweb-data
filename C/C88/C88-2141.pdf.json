The PRC uses the preference type of knowledge to compute the PVs.","KGW+p prepares a ti'amework in which we can obtain the flezibiliiy of control, ilte modurarily i~ knowledge preparation , a.nd lhe efficiency aild completencs.~ of parsing at the same ~ime.","I~ is a w.~ry delicate and difficnlt problem to decide the actual PVs of interpretations and the threshohl value for suspending PPTs. Because w~rious different sorts of factors may contribute to the PVs with different strengths, we certainly have to coinbrae conventional NLP techniques with appropriate statistical and stoeha.stie models. We hope that KGW-I p giw:s us a good starting imint for such future researches. ]SLefere~me~","[Ford82] Ford, M., Bresnan, J., Kaplan, it. : A Competence Based Theory of Syntactic Ck)sure, inThe Mental l{epresentafiou of Grammatical RelaLions (ed: Bresnan), MIT Press, 1982.","[Itirst8,t] tiisrt, G.J. : Sen,~nLic Ambiguity against Ambiguity, phi) thesis, B~own /0~dvertdty> J984.","[Ikeda86] lked% Y., Tsujii, J., Nagao, M.: Unillcation based Grammar and its Control in Parsing, SI(] on Communication and Natural Language Processing, JSECE, 1987 (in Jap~mese).","[Kay80] Kay, M.: Algorithm Schemata and Data Structures m Syntactic Processing, Technical Report CS1,-80-12, Xerox I'AI[C, 1986.","[lVluto88] Mute, Y., Tsujii, J., Nagao, M.: Preference Rule and their Application Mechanism in KGW+p, SIG on Communieatiov and Natural Language Preceding, JSECI';, 1988 (in Japanese).","[Pereira85] Pereira, F.: A New Characterization of Attachment Preferences, in Natural Language Parsing (eds: l)owty, Karttunen, Zwicky), Cambridge University Press, 1985.","[Pratt75] Pratt, V.tL: A Progress Report, Prec. of 4th LICAI, 1.975."]},{"title":"[Tsujii8,1]","paragraphs":["Tsujii, 'J., Nakamura, J., Nagao, M.: Analysis Gram mar of Japanese in the MII Project, Prec. of Coling 84, Stanford~ 1984.","[Winograd83] Winograd, q'.: Language as a Cognitive l'roeess, Addison-Wesley, 198;! 587"]}]}
