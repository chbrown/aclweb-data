The strategy includes parsing and phrase prediction algorithms. After speech processing and phrase recognition based on phoneme recognition, the parser extracts the sentence with the best likelihood taking account of the phonetic likelihood of phrase candidates and the linguistic likelihood of the semantic inter-phrase dependency relationships. A fast parsing algorithm using breadth-first search is also proposed. The predictor pre-selects the p}~.ase candidates using transition rules combined with a dependency structure to reduce the amount of phonetic processing. The proposed linguistic processor has been tested through speech recognition experiments. The experimental results show that it greatly increases the accuracy of speech recognitions, and the breadth-first parsing algorithm and predictor increase processing speed. 1. Introduction","In conventional continuous speech recognition and understanding systems[1~4], linguistic rules for sentences composed of phrase sequences are usually expressed by a phrase structure grammar such as a transition network or context free grammar. In such methods, however, phoneme recognition errors and rejections result in incorrect transition states because of the strong syntactical constraints. These erroneous transitions cause the following candidates to be incorrectly chosen or the processing system to halt. Therefore, these errors and rejections can be fatal to speech understanding. Furthermore, a complete set of these grammatical rules for speech understanding is very difficult to provide.","To address these problems, this paper proposes a new linguistic processor based on a dependency structure grammar, which integrates a bottom~up sentence parser and a top-down phrase predictor. ~lis grammar is more semantic and less syntactic than phrase structure grammar, and, therefore, syntactic positional constraint in a sentence rarely occurs with this parser. This effectively prevents extreme degradation in speech recognition from errors and rejections in phoneme recognition and greatly increases the accuracy of speech processing. This grammar only has two syntactic rules, so this parser is free of many cumbersome grammatical rules that are indispensable to other grammars. This grammar particularly suits phrase-order-free languages such as Japanese."]},{"title":"4a~ rule I rule 2","paragraphs":["For the parser of this grammar, a depth-first parsing algorithm with backtracking which guarantees the optimal solution was devised[5]. However, parsing long sentences composed of many phrases with this algorithm can be time-consuming because of combinatorial explosion, since the amount of computation is exponential order with respect to the number of phrases. Therefore, a fast parsing algorithm using breadth-first search and beam search was developed. This algorithm is based on flmdamental algorithms[6,7] which only take account of the dependency relationships of the modifier and modificant phrases, and it handles higher linguistic or semantic processing such as case structure. The processing ability of this breadth-first algorithm is equivalent to that of the depth-first algorithm.","To effectively recognize speech, the amount of phonetic processing must be reduced through top-down prediction of hypotheses. However, top-down centre] using the principal dependency structure is impossible. To solve this problem, this novel phrase predictor was devised. This predictor pre-selects hypotheses for phoneme recognition using prediction rules, and then it reduces the amount of phonetic processing. Prediction rules are created by integrating connection rules and phrase dependency structures.","The effeetivenessof this linguistic processing was ascertained through speech recognition experiments. 2. Linguistic processor 2. 1 Dependency ntJcueturegrammar","This grammar is based on semantic dependency relationships between phrases. The syntactic rules satisfy the following two constraints. First, any phrase, except the last phrase of a sentence, can modify only one later phrase. Each modification, called a dependency relationship or dependenc 2 structure, can be represented by one arc. Second, modification arcs between phrases must not cross. These rules are illustrated in Fig. I. In two unacceptable sentences, one sentence is unacceptable because one phrase modifies the former phrase, and Acceptable sentence ~~a~le sentence A B C D A B C D ×","A B C D × A B C D","Fig. 1. Examples using a dependency structure grammar A,B,C and D are sentence phrases. the ether sentence is unacceptable because arcs cross in its dependency structures. 2. 2Parser","After phonetic phrase recognition, recognition results are represented in a phonetic score matrix form as shown in Fig. 2. When analyzing dependency relationships, the parser extracts the most likely sentence in this matrix by taking into account the phonetic ]_ikelihood of phrase candidates and the linguistic likelihood of semantic inter-phrase dependency relationships. The parser also obtains the dependenqy structure that corresponds to the semantic structure of the extracted sentence. 2. 2. 1 Objective function","This parsing is equivalent to solving the following objective function using the constraints of dependency structure grammar. For simplicity, the following linguistic formulation is described for speech uttered phrase by phrase. The process for sentence speech is described in section 4.","N T -- max[ 2;'c(xi ,p) + maxZdep(w I j_1,Xj,piY1,j,p)] (I)","p j::l \" Y j=l ' where I~j.<N, 1Kp~M, N is the number of input phrases, M is the maximum number of phonetic recognition candidates for each phrase, Xj,p is a candidate of the j~th input phrase with the p-th best phonetic likelihood, and c(xj,p) is its phonetic likelihood (positive value). Also, Xi,j, p is a phrase sequence with one phrase candidate for each i-th to j-th input phrase and whose last phrase is Xj,p. Yi,j,p is one of the dependency structures of Xi,j,p, wi,j_ I is the set of phrases that modify Xj,p in the sequence Xi,j, p. Here, dep(w,xlY) is the linguistic likelihood (negatiw! value) of dependency relationships between w and x taking Y into account. Namely, the first item of the teem on the right in Eq. (I) is the summation of phonetic likelihoods of the hypothesized sentence composed of its phrase sequence, and the second item is the summation of linguistic likelihood. Maximizing Eq. (1) gives the sentence and the dependency structure of it as speech recognition and t~dersta~ling results.","Because dependency structure grammar is compatible with case grammar[8], the linguistic semantic likelihood(dep) of the dependency structure is easily provided using case structure. The following are example:~ of items for evaluating dependency relationships: the disagreement between the semantic primitives of the modifier and that requested by the modificant, the lack of the ob].igatory case phrase requested by the modificant, and the existence of differenb phrases with the same case and modifying the same phrase. The likelihood values for these items are given heuristically.","To so]re equation (I), a fast parsing algorithm using breadth-first search and beam search was developed. This algorithm deals with higher linguistic or semantic processing such as the case structure.. Although this algorithm offers sub-optimal solutions, it is practical because it requires less processing than depth-first search. 2. 2. 2 l~ce~t~z-firstpe~csingalgorithm","The breadth-first algorithm is formulated as order of candidates 1 2 ......

Based on basic expansion algorithms[14,15] from phrase-wise to sentence speech, the speech recognition and understanding accuracy using the proposed algorithm is greatly increased compared to the accuracies using the basic algorithms. In the sentence speech, phrase recognition results after phonetic processing are represented in a score lattice form withphonetic recognition scores averaged. The parser extracts the best sentence composed of a phrase sequence by scanning this lattice. The processing order is O(NSM2L2), which is practical amount of computation, where N is the number of detected phrase boundaries in the uttered sentence, M is the maximum number of phonetic recognitio~ candidates for each phrase segment f~em one boundsry to the next boundary, and L is the maximum number of beams.","The effectiveness of this parser was tested through sentence speech recognition with one speaker uttering i0 sentences containing a total of 67 phrases. This parser increased phrase recognition performance in the sentences by approximately 49Z (from 27~ without the parser to 76~ with the parser). 5- Conclusion","This paper proposed an efficient linguistic processing strategy for speech recognition and understanding using a dependency structure grammar. This grammar suits processing of phrase-order-free languages such as Japanese and processing the result of front-end speech recognition, which is usually erroneous~ This linguistic processing strategy includes bottom-up parsing and a top-down phrase hypotheses predictor. In particular, the bottom-up parser, taking account of the phonetic and linguistic likelihood, greatly increases the accuracy and speed of speech recognition. The predictor reduces the amount of phonetic processing by pre-selecting the phrase hypotheses. The effectiveness of this parser and predictor was shown in speech recognition experiments.","Future development is include the statistical likelihood of dependency relationships, integration with the statistical phonetic method like Hidden Markov Models, and higher linguistic processing using the semantics and context knowledge.","Aaknowlmlgment","The authors would like to express their appreciation to Dr. Kiyoshi Sugiyama and Dr. Sadaoki Furui, for their invaluable guidance.
