This SOV- versm~ SVOo character has important consequences for the expres° sion of scope. I claim that in both types of languages the position of NEG is as close to the left-hand side of the verb as possible: it only precedes possible Q~ elements that are wlthin the scope of NEG/Van Muno ster 1985/. Consider the following scheme: Dutch: S O-(O) NEG-V English/Spanish: S NEG-V 0-(0) In an SOV-language the verb (in basic position) is in sentence-final position, while in an SVOdangaage the verb is in second position. Consequently, in a~a SVO.. language only two elements (one in subject po~ition and one in 'zhift-position~, i.e. the position to the left of the subject) s can precede NEG; the objects are to the right of NEG in basic position° ~L an SOV-language like Dutch, however, the objects axe to the left of NEG in basic position. In principle there is no restriction to the number of elements that can appear to the left of NEG. In genera[ it can be said that, especially if the sentence 442 contains a NEG, an SOV-language is more 'suited' to express scope through word order than is an SVO-language.","This basic difference between Dutch and Spanish/English can cause problems when translating from one type of language into the other.

These transformations precede the substitution-rules. The shift-transformations can be subdivided into two Ca, ses:","1. A VAR is shifted over a [+Q] VAR. For (9), (in which both arguments are [q-q]), this means that the shift-transformations render two surface orders of VARa:","(path i) xl x2 lezen","(path ii) shift/x2 xl lezen Later on, in the Substitution rules, only (ii) of-fers the correct input for a succesful application of Substitution rules, since VAR1 has to be substituted first (right-left generation).

A VAR. is shifted over a f-Q] VAR, under one of","the following conditions:","a. There are two [+Q] VARs in the VP. The left","one can shift over the f-Q] NP (subject).","b.

Although the conditions for both Dutch and Spanish/English are the same, the motivation for the shift over a f-Q] NP in both types of languages (i.e. SOV vs. SVO) is different: For SVO-languages this shift is necessary in order to put a [+Q] argument in a position to the left of NEG, i.e. to get the correct scope relations.

In order to avoid many wrong paths in the derivation process, the implementation iB slightly different: it is possible to extract information about the substituent from the derivation tree and assign the correct Q-value to the VAR, before the generative rules apply. 1°The shift-transformations also shift WH-elements andI relatives. 4/46; For Dutch, being an SOVqanguage, this type of shift is not necessary for scope, since all Q-NPs can precede NEG without shift (see section 1.2). However, this type of shift should be done anyway in order to generate both (15)a and (15)b as paraphrases of each other:","(15) a Jan geeft reel kinderen een snoepje.","'Jolm-gives-many-children-a-sweet'","b Veel kiuderen geeft Jan een snoepje.","'Many-chilclren-gives- John-a-swe et ' (16)a and (16)b are also paraphrases of each other, but"]},{"title":"(17)a and (l~)b are not, considering condition 2b TM","paragraphs":["(16) a Jan heeft veel boeken niet gelezen.","' Jotm-has-many-books-not-read'","b Veel boeken heeft Jan ulet gelezen.","'Many-bo oks-has-Jolm-not-read'","(17) a Jan heeft veel boeken gelezen.","' J olm-has-many-b o ok s-re ad '","b Veel boeken heeft Jan gelezen.","'Many-books-has-John-read' 2.2.4 Loosening conditions As I explained earlier (sect.ion i.3), in the SOV-language Dutch it is easier to express scope through word order than in English and Spanish, especially if the sentence contains a negation.

In general it can be stated that Rneg and Rsubst can apply freely even if there is a free VA.R. to the right, if this VAR is [-S]. Now there are two possibilities: - The VAI~ is definite.

In fact, (17)b is a correct paraphrase of (17}a in case vee/bo~ke~ is not focus, but not in all cases. In short, under the conditions given only a paraphrase is given if the topicalized argument has to be a non-focus element, namely in case the negation is the focus ((16)b as paraphrase of (16)a) and in case another argument as the one topicalized is focus ((15)b as paraphrase of"]},{"title":"(l~)a). x2R-L gsnsration in case of deflnitea is merely done for efficiency, in order to avoid unwanted ambiguities.","paragraphs":["Let me illustrate this process with an example.
