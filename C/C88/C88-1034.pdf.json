BITNET We present a morpho-syntactic analyzer for French which is capable of automatically detecting and of correcting (automatically or with user help) spelling mistakes, agreement errors and certain frequently encountered syntactic errors. Emphasizing the specific language knowledge that is used, we describe the major sub-tasks of this analyzer: word categorization by dictionary look-up and spelling correction, construction of a parse tree or of a forest of parse trees, correction of syntactic and morphological errors by processing the parse tree. The spelling corrector module is designed to help correct the spelling mistakes of a French novice, as opposed to those of an experienced typist. The syntax analysis module is driven by an empirical grammar for French and is based on the work of Tomita. The presentation is based on the design and implementation of a prototype of the system which is written in Lisp for the Macintosh computer. 1. INTRODUCTION Our goal is to construct a morpho-syntactic analyzer for French which is capable of automatically detecting and of correcting (automatically or with help from the user) spelling mistakes, agreement errors and the most important syntax errors. This system could be used to analyze word processor output, for example. Since our main goal is to implement a robust and efficient analyzer for French, we have designed a system which can detect errors as opposed to one which can only process well-formed input. A number of systems for English text analysis have been developed. The Writer's Workbench/Frase 1983/is a collection of tools developed at AT&T's Bell Laboratories: the two most important ones address proof reading and style analysis. The EPISTLE project /Miller, Heidorn & Jensen 1981/is a vast project undertaken at IBM's Thomas J. Watson research laboratory, the long term goal of which is to develop a system which not only supports writing, but also text understanding. WANDAH/Friedman 1984/, a system that was developed at UCLA, comprises three sub-systems: a word processor designed to support interactive composition, tools to assist composition and tools to help in the editing and the revising phases. These systems are difficult to adapt to French since they are based on knowledgg which is specific to English. Furthermore, in these systems the gnowledge is rarely represented explicitly: indeed, the knowledge/has most often been \"compiled\" for reasons of efficiencyj Thus, these systems cannot easily reason about the knowledge they have. /- The ~ovel feature of our system is that it is based on an integration at different levels of the knowledge of French. This knowledge is represented explicitly in the system and the system keeps track of the decisions it has made, which will allow it not only to justify its decisions but also to reason about its reasoning. The main problem is in the integration of knowledge of the language, knowledge which is at different levels: knowledge of orthography/Catach 1980/, of traditional grammar/Le nouveau Bescherelle 1980//Grevisse 1969/, of syntax/Grevisse 1969/ /Gross 1975//Boons, Guillet & Lecl~re 1976/and also of the most frequently encountered errors/Catach, Duprez & Legris 1980//Class & Hor~,uelin 1979//Lafontaine, Dubuisson & \"~ Research ftlnded by the Social Sciences Research Council of ..... Canada (SSRCC grant no. 410-85-1360). Emirkanian 1982/. In order to be able to use such ka,owledge, it must on the one hand be made operational and it must on the other hand be orchestrated. In our system, these sources of knowledge are used as follows. Each sentence of the text is split up into words. Each word i.~ categorized by dictionary look-up; knowledge of French orthography is represented as a collection of correction rules. An efficient parser, driven by a context-free grammar, builds a parse tree oi\" a forest of parse trees in the case of ambiguity. This parser is deterministic in the sense that it blocks as soon as an error i.~ detected. The parser can recall the spelling corrector, if need be,. Then, knowledge of the sub-categorization of French verbs allows the system to eliminate automatically certain ambiguities and to detect and correct many errors. Finally, the user is consulted whenever the system cannot intervene. Before presenting the system in depth, we must emphasize that the system we have designed is intended to assist at the knowledge level and not at the competence level. It is not designed as a tool to improve written communication skills.","The main sub-tasks of the system are as foUows: word categorization by dictionary look-up and spelling col~rection, construction of a parse tree or of a forest of parse trees in cases of ambiguity, correction of syntax errors, detection and co~xection of morphological errors by processing the parse u'ee. We shall now examine these three phases.","2. WORD CATEGORIZATION AND SPELLING CORRECTION 2.1 Classification of spelling mistakes We have adopted Catach's classification /Catach, Duprez & Legris 1980/from where we also borrow the examples. She distinguishes phonetic errors (*puplier instead ofpublier ), from phonogrammic errors (the user knows the sound without knowing the transcription) some of which can modify the phonic value of a word (*gdrir instead of gudrir, *oisis instead of oasis ) whilst others do not change the phonic value (*pharmatie instead of pharmacie ). In addition to these two types of errors, she identifies morphogrammic errors (caused by faulty knowledge of non-phonetic orthography) in grammatical elements (number agreement, for example) or in lexical elements (*enterremant instead of enterrement, *abrit instead of abri, for example), confusion of lexieal homophones (vain / vin ) or grammatical homophones (on / ont ), problems with ideograms (punctuation, for example) and finally problems with non-functional letters which are derived, for example, from the Greek origin of a word (*tdatre instead of theatre). We have excluded from our area of investigation ,all phonetic errors, that is errors which can be caused by faulty prommciation. On the other hand, our system can handle all the phonograrmnic errors. Morphogrammic errors in grammatical elements are detected during the later morphological analysis phase. Errors in lexical morphemes are conected during this phase, as well as errors which are due to the existence of non-functional letters. As for problems with homophones, grammatical homophones are detected during the parsing or the syntax analysis phases, but only some lexical homophones are detected during these phases: we can correct vain / vin but not chant / champ, since these elements, in addition to being homophones, belong to the same lexical categot¢. The sem,3nfic knowledge available in ore\" system is not sufficient to resolve this ambiguity. Regarding spelling mistakes, phonogrammic errors (i.e., those due to the transcription of sounds) are the most frequent in French, mainly because of the problems caused by the phonic/graphic con'espondence. For example, the sound [o] can be wxitten in many ways: au, aud (at the end of a word), eau, etc. This is not the ease in English/Peterson 1980/, where the main spelling mistakes seem to be due to random insertions or .~uppressions of letters, substitution of a letter for another o1\" transposition of two letters. We call these errors \"typographical\" e~rors: we will not discuss them fresher in this paper. 2.2 The E~ietionary Our system is based on two dictionaries, a dictionary of stems and a dictional y of endings. Associated with a stem, in the stem dictionary, is .~;tored a pointer to a list of one or more endings which are stored in the endings dictionary. In this way, our system can handle all inflected forms efficiently, as well as the numerous exceptions. Based on a suggestion by Knuth/Knuth 1973/, a trie is used to index the stem dictionary. Diacritical signs are removed from the letters when the trie is constructed and also when a word is looked up in the trie. Indeed, the letters modified by the diacritical signs are only stored in the leaves of the trie. This allows our system to handle accent errors, a common spelling mistake, very efficiently. Instead of storing \"chameau\", \"chameaux\", \"ehamelle\" and \"ch,'unelles\" in the dictionary, we only store the common form \"chino-\" in the stem dictionary together with its lexical category. We also store there, as pointers to the endings dictionary, the corresponding rules for constructing the number and gender endings and any additional syntactic or semantic information, as requited. 2.3 The look-up algorithm The word to be looked up is scanned from left to right: each letter, strippe~l of its diacritical sign if need be, controls the walking of the stem trie until a leaf is reached. Associated with the leaf, we find the lexical category and the ending rules for the stem. Remafifing letters of the word are looked up in the list of endings associated with the stem: the entry corresponding to an ending records, for example, the number and gender of nouns and adjectives o1' the person, time and mood of the verbs which have this ending (the endings lists contain all possible endings of the verhs/Le nouveau Beseherelle 1980/). The most important ending errors are also recorded in the endings lists. Using this information, the system can detect and correct at this level ending errors: for exa!nple, *chevals instead of chevaux, *eloux instead of clous. A block during trie traversal signals the detection of a spelling mistake:. The context of the letter responsible for the block is used m index a large set of rewrite rules, called correction mh',s, which are derived mainly from the phonic/graphic transcription rules of Freuch/Catach, Duprez & I_egris 1980/. These rules characterize the knowledge of French orthography which is used to comect the spelling error. 2°4 The correction algorithm Although the set of eorrection rules is mostly based on the phonic/graphic transcription rules of French, certain rules are not based on such a strict correspondence at all since the programs can also, for example, conect *enui to ennui and *gdrir to gudrir. Wl,en a leaf is finally reached, the rule or rules which were applied to unblock the walk in the trie are used to correct the misspelt word. In addition to substitution rules, we have a set of roles which are used only on the ending of a word. These rules are applied before the substitution rules. For example, for the word *blan the system proposes blanc, and for the word *tros it proposes trots, trop and trot, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Flchlor Edltloo F~li~tros Loxique i:i~glri ~.S~Jnt.

Fig. 1 If the user is not satisfied with a correction, the system can, upon request, propose another in some cases. For example, in response to the word *vi the system proposes vie (the noun) and if the user requests another correction, it then proposes the two verbs voir and vivre as can be seen in Fig. 2, since the stem, or one of the stems, of these verbs matches the word *vi. The user may conjugate these verbs using our Conjugueur tool, as can be seen in Fig. 3. li~ Flchler Edition F~r~ti'~ Loriiqoe li~gio It.Si~.t.

Indeed, for the word entente spelt *antente, the first block point is just after the second n since antenais and antenne 'are in our dictionary/Robert 1967/. The size of the dictionary and of the set of correction rules is large. The system uses simple metrics as heuristics/Romanycia & Pelletier 1985/in order to filter the set of correction rules and reduce the search space. The selected rules are analyzed and those that do not increase trie penetration depth or those that do not allow the system to move forward in a word (simple metrics of progress towards the goal of accounting for all the letters in a word) are rejected. Note that the expectations of the dictionary, represented as a trie, also effectively constrain the search space. 2.5 Word categorization At this point, a word can have been assigned a single lexical category, as for example cahier : N IF-, etc.]. The word can also be assigned a wrong category, as for example in il *pin : N [F- ,etc.] which was written instead of il peint. Finally, a word can be assigned many categories (case of lexical ambiguity), as for example il vente : N [F+,etc.] / V [present 3 rd person of indicative / subjunctive].","3. CONSTRUCTION OF A PARSE TREE OR OF A FOREST We have compiled an emph-ical grammar of written French which is described by a context-free grammar. Our parser is based on the work of Tomita/Tomita 1986//Tomita 1987/. In a Tomita parser, a general purpose parsing procedure is driven by a parsing table which is generated mechanically from the context-free grammar of the language to be parsed. Tomita's main contribution has been to propose the use of a graph-structured stack which allows the parser to handle multiple structural ambiguities efficiently. We use YACC /Johnson 1983/, a LALR(1) parsing table generator available in UNIX to automatically generate the parsing table which drives the general parsing procedure. When generating the parsing tables, YACC detects and sign',ds cases of sn~uctural ambiguity. Many cases can arise in parsing French. Consider first the case when a word has been assigned multiple categories. Some of the ambiguities can be resolved by considering the expectations of the grammar. Consider the word court which can be an adjective, an adverb, a noun or a verb. If court is found in the context il : [ProC1] court : Adj / Adv / N / V [3 rd person singular, etc.], the grammar accepts only the verb at this point. Similarly the word une which can be a determinant, a noun or a pronoun can automatically be reduced to noun in the context il a lu la une du journal. Consider now the case when the parser cannot derive a parse tree: based on the hypothesis that there may be a spelling error which caused an erroneous category to be assigned, the parser calls the spelling correetor to revise the spelling of a word and hence the category assigned to it. In the case of the previous example il *pin, of the spelling alternatives for pin, only peint, the verb, is retained since pain is no more possible in this context than pin. Indeed, in our grammar of the sentence only a verb or another clitic pronoun may appear after a clitic pronoun. Similarly, in the sentence ils *on apportd le livre, *on will be corrected to ont . The parser efficiently constructs a parse tree or a forest of parse trees which account for the sentence. In a Tomita parser, the forest of parse trees is represented by a data structure analogous to a chart/Winograd 1983/, which allows for \"local ambiguity packing\". 4. ANALYSIS OF THE PARSE TREE OR FOREST A forest of parse trees can be produced in classical cases of structural ambiguity such as in Pierre expddie des porcelaines de Chine. The two parse trees generated for this sentence can be seen in Fig. 4 and 5. The bracketed Lisp representation of these trees can be found in Fig. 6 and 7.

In many cases, only some of the trees in the forest need be retained, since the system can automatically clear the forest. For example, although two parse trees are constructed for the sentence Jean n'a pas ¢ffectud de lancer (lancer could be an infinitive verb or a noun), ordy the tree with lancer categorized as a noun is retained, as shown in Fig. 8.","(So (sn (n \"Jean\")) (svc (sadv (adv \"n\"))"]},{"title":"(auxc \"a\")","paragraphs":["(sadv (adv \"pas\")) (vc (vpp \"effectu6\")) (sn (det \"de\")","(n \"lancer\"))))"]},{"title":"Fig. 8","paragraphs":["At this level, the sub-categorization of the verb is of great help: this information is also stored in the dictionary of course. For example, effectuer does not allow an infinitive phrase as a complement. Simih'trly, in the sentence il a remarqud Marie arriwmt d tottte allure, Marie arrivant d toute allure could be an adverbial plwase, Marie could be the object of remarquer and arriwmt d torte allure could be ml adverbial phrase, finally Marie arrivant d tot,.te allure could be the object of remarquer. The first hypothesis (uee) is rejected since remarquer is sub-categorized as requiring a di:,:cct complement. Sub-categori:;ation is used to clear the forest of trees, Fig. 9-12, resulting from the analysis of the sentence il pense d l'envie de Paul de s'eurichir.","(so (spro (l?ro-qu \"il\"))","(sve (vc (vconj \"pense\"))","(sp (prep \"/t\")","(sn (det \"1\") (n \"envie\") (sp (prep \"de\")","(sn (n \"Paul\")","(si (prep \"de\")","(svinf (procl \"s\")","(vinf \"enriehir\")))))))))"]},{"title":"Fig. 9 (sc","paragraphs":["(spro (pro-qu \"il\"))","(svc (vc (vconj \"pense\"))","(sp (,prep \"~\")","(sn (det 'T') (n \"envie\") (sp (prep \"de\")","(sn (n \"Paul\"))) (si (prep \"de\")","(svinf (procl \"s\")","(vinf \"enrichir\")))))))"]},{"title":"Fig. 10 (se","paragraphs":["(spro (pro-qu \"il\"))","(svc (ve (vconj \"pense\"))","(sp (prep \"h.\") (sn (det 'T')","(n \"envie\")","(sp (prep \"de\")","(sn (n \"Paul\")))))","(si (prep \"de\") (svinf (procl \"s\")","(vinf \"enrichir\")))))"]},{"title":"Fig. 11","paragraphs":["(spro (pro-qu \"il\"))","(svc (vc (vconj \"pense\"))","(sp (prep \",¥') (sn (dot 'T')","(n \"envie\")))","(sp (prep \"de\") (sn (n \"Paul\")","(si (prep \"de\")","(svinf (procl \"s\")","(vinf \"enrichir\")))))))"]},{"title":"(se","paragraphs":["Fig. 12 The sub-categorization information for the verb penser allows us to eliminate the lrees of Fig. 11 and 12. Since Paul cannot be sub-categorized by an infinitive sentence, as peur can be (la peur de s'enrichir), the tree in Fig. 9 can also be eliminated. The only remaining analysis is the tree in Fig. 10. Verb sub-categorization also allows the system to COXTeCt some spelling mistakes at this stage. For example, the sentence *il panse que Marie viendra will be corrected to il pense que Mcwie viendra since panser does not accept a completivc. Similarly, in il va *ou il veut, *ou is corrected to ot~. At this level we also correct, using information stored in the dictionary, an error of the type *quoique tu discs, je partirai to qu/)i qtte tu discs, je partirai, since the sub-categorization of dire is not satisfied in the first case. It is also verb sub-categorization information which allows us to conect certain trees and improve others. Consider the case of con'ecting a u'ee. For the sentence, il punit qui ment, i~fitially qui ment is labelled as a sentence connected to the verb punir. Then, the sentence qui rnent is relabelled as a noun phrase. Consider now the case where the sub-categorization allows us to improve a tree. In the sentence Pierre lira un livre cette nuit , cette nuit initially labelled noun phrase, will be relabeIled adverbial phrase since lire cannot be sub-categorized by two noun phrases, as nommer can be, for example. 5. CORRECTING SYNTAX ERRORS AND"]},{"title":"AGREEMENT","paragraphs":["ERRORS Experience has shown that syntactic errors are relatively infrequent. For example, in a study of the syntax of primary school students/Dubuisson & Emirkanian 1982a//Dubuisson & Emirkanian 1982b/, out of 6580 communication units, only 79 (1.2%) were found to be ungrammatical. The unit of communication is equivalent to what the traditional gratmnar calls the sentence, that is the root sentence and any embedded sentences/Loban 1976/. We observed/Lafontaine, Dubuisson 169 and Emirkanian 1982/that the most frequent problem is in the use of subordination (53% of the errors), the use of complex relative clauses in particular (24 cases out of 42). Children also have problems with multiple embeddings: in general when they connect an embedded sentence to another, the resulting sentence is ungrammatical, the main sentence being absent or incomplete. The other problems are related to coordination, to constituent mobility and to the use of clitic pronouns where we observed a strong influence from the oral. As for relative clauses, we counted non-standard clauses as ungrammatical, though they follow rules as do the standard relative clauses. La fille que je te parle et la fille que je parle avec are examples of non-staudard relative clauses whilst the sentence *la fiUe dont que je te parle is ungrammatical We have chosen for now to focus our attention on two of these problems: complex relative clauses and sequences of clitics. As part of a previous research project, we developed algorithms for handling complex relative clauses/Emirkanian & Bouchard 1987/ and sequences of elitics/Emirkanian & Bouchard 1985/. For the sentence la fille que je parle, the syntax correction algorithm proposes la fille de qui/dont/de laquelle/avec quilavec laquelle/d qui/c~ laquelle je parle. On the other hand, in response to the sentence la fille que je te parle, the algorithm proposes dont, de qui and de laquelle as possible choices. Again it is the sub-categorization of the verb which gives us a handle on the problems with sequences of clitic pronouns. The program con'ects *je lui aide toje l'aide, for example. However, in most cases, only an error is reported, the system is unable to correct the error since it cannot identify precisely tile referent of the clitic. *J'y donne and *je lui donne are examples of ungrammatical sentences; the system cannot propose with certainty the missing clitics: it will propose la lui, le lui, etc.., in the first case and le lui , la lui , lui en , etc.., in the second case. During morphological analysis, based on the information gleaned fi'om the dictionary, the information collected in the parse tree and the agreement rules of French, the system isolates the noun phrases and checks to see if the agreement rules for number and gender have been appIied. It then checks for agreement between the subject and the verb. Note that, for example, in the case of *les belles chameaux , the system proposes both les beaux chameaux and les belles chamelles . In response to the sentence *le professeur explique la lemon aux ~ldve de la classes, the system proposes le professeur explique la leqon aux dldves de la classe , aux dldves des classes, ~ l'~ldve de la classe and also d l'#ldve des classes , even if, based on our knowledge of the world, we know that the last answer is less probable. The agreement rules which we have formalized, some of which are recorded in the dictionary, allow our system to correct the errors most frequently found in written text /Lebrun 1980/ /Pelchat 1980/. These errors are due, in particular for number agreement, to semantic interferences or to the proximity of other elements: for example, * il veut ~tre trds riches instead of U veut dtre trds riche , *je les voient instead of je les vois and * Michel nous donnent des bonbons instead of Michel nous donne des bonbons . Finally, note that certain lexieal ambiguities (there are relatively few remaining at this stage) could be resolved here: for example, this is the case for le chouette anglais , but la chouette anglaise still remains ambiguous. 6. CONCLUSION The automatic correction of French text is a major project. Knowledge at many different levels must be integrated and coordinated in the system. Only the construction of a prototype can attest to the success of such an integration. We have developed a prototype of the correction program in LISP on a Macintosh Plus. The behavior of the final system will be refined by weighting the rules according to their utility. Statistics gathered from many different users will help us tune the general behavior of the system whilst statistics gathered for a given user will allow us to tune the behavior of the system to the problems specific to that user.
