In this section, three key notions, splitting, combining and local ambiguity packing, are described. 4.1. Splitting When a stack needs to be reduced (or popped) In more than one way, the top of the stack Is split as in the following example. Suppose that the stack Is In the following state, The left most element, A, is the bottom of the stack, and the right most element, E, is the top of the stack. In a graph-structured stack, there can be more than one top, whereas there can be at most one bottom.

Phrase-Structure.Based Parsing with a","Graph-Structured Stack Tonrita [11, 12] Introduced a generalized LR parsing algorithm, which is an LR parsing algorithm generalized to handle arbitrary context-free grammars with the graph-structured stack, The standard (not generalized) LR parsing algorithm is one of the most efficient parsing algodlhms. It Is totally deterministic, no backtracking or search is involved, and it runs in linear time. This standard LR parsing algorithm, however, can deal with only a small subset of context-free grammars called LR grammars, which Is often sufliclent for programming languages but clearly not for natural languages. I1, for example, a grammar is ambiguous, then Its LR table would have multiple entries, and hence deterministic parsing would be no longer possible. By Introducing the graph-structured stack, however, mulUple entries can be handled efficiently In polynomhd time. Figures 6-1 and 6-2 show an example of a non-LR grammar and Ils LR table. Grammar symbols starting with \"*\" represent proterminals. Entries \"sh n\" In the action table (tile left part of tire table) Indicate that the action \"shift one word from Input buffer onto the slack, and go to stale n\". Entries \"re n\" indicate that the action \"reduce constituents on the stack using rule n\", The entry \"acc\" stands for the action \"accept\", and blank spaces represent \"error\". The goto table (the right part of the table) decides to what slate tire parser should go alter a reduce action. The LR parsing algorithm pushes state numbers (as well as constituents) onto tile stack; the state number on lhe top of the stack indicates the current state. The exact definition and operation of the LR parser can be found in Aho and Ullman [2]. We can see that there are two multiple entdes in the action table; on the rows of slate 11 and 12 at the column labeled \"*prep\", Roughly speaking, thts Is the situation where the parser encounters a preposition of a PP right after a NP. If this PP does not modlly the NP, then the parser can go ahead to rednce the NP to a higher nontermlaal such as PP or VP, using rule 6 or 7, respectively (re6 and re7 In lhe multiple entries). If, on the other hand, the PP does modify the NP, then the parser must wait (sh6) until the PP Is completed so It can build a higher NP using rule 5. With a graph-structured stack, we can handle these nondeterministic phenomena nicely. Figure 6-3 shows the graph-structured stack dghl after shifting the word \"with\" in the sentence \"1 (i) s --> NP vP (2) s --> s ~P (3) NP --> *n (4) NP --> *det *n (5) NP ---> NP PP (6) PP --'> *prep NP (7) VP --> *v NP","Figure 6-1 : An Example Ambiguous Grammar","State *dot *n *v *prep $ NP PP VP S","......................................................................... 0 sh3 sh4 2 i i sh6 ace 5 2 sh7 sh6 9 8 3 shl0 4 re3 re3 re3 5 re2 re2 6 sh3 sh4 ii 7 sh3 sh4 12 8 rel tel 9 re5 re5 re5 10 re4 re4 re4 Ii re6 re6, sh6 re6 9 12 re7,sh6 re7 9","Figure 6-2: LR Parsing Table with Multiple Entries","(derived from the grammar In fig 6-1) / .............. s .................... 1 .............. \\ / \\ / ............. s ................. z ...... \\ \\ / \\ \\","/ / ......... .~ ...... 12 ....... \\ \\","/ / \\ \\"]},{"title":"0---NP--2---v--=7==-NP--12--~p---6---NP--ll---p--=6---NP--ll---p---6","paragraphs":["\\ \\ / \\ / /","\\ ..... s .... z .... \\ ........... / \\ ......... up ......... / /","\\ /","\\ .........

We can enhance the generalized Lt~ parsing algoriihm by allowing Io×icons to (optionally) have le×icon-driv~n rules.
