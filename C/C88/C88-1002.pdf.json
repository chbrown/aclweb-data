We present the linguistic coverage of our grammar, and explain the linguistic reasons which lead us to choose the particular representations. We show that TAG formalism provides sufficient constraints for handling most of the linguistic phenomena, with minimal linguistic stipulations.

We then give a detailed analysis of sentential complements, because it has lead us to introduce substitution in the formalism, and because TAG makes interesting predictions. We discuss the different linguistic phenomena corresponding to adjunction and to substitution respectively. We then movc on to support verb constructions, which are represented in a TAG in a simpler way than the usual double analysis. It is the first time support verb constructions are handled in a parser. We lastly give an overview of the treatment of adverbs, and suggest a treatment of idioms which make them fall into the same representations as 'free' structures."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) was introduced by/Joshi et al. 1975/ as a formalism for linguistic description. A TAG's basic component is a finite set of elementary trees, each of which is a domain of locality, and can be viewed as a minimal linguistic structure.","A TAG comprises of two kinds of elementary trees: initial trees (a), which are complete structures, usually rooted in S, with preterminals on all their leaves, and auxiliary trees (fl), which are constrained to have exactly one leaf node labeled with a non-terminal of the same category as their root node. We have added lexical trees (6), which are initial trees corresponding to arguments. Their insertion in preterminal nodes of elementary trees, which serves as psedicates, is obligatory.","Sentences of the language of a TAG are derived from the composition of an initial tree and any number of auxiliary trees by an operation called 'adjunction'.

Recursion is provided by the structure of the auxiliary trees which can adjoin into themselves. Adjunction allows the insertion of a complete structure at an interior node of another complete structure. It appears to be a natural way of handling adverbs and modifiers in natural language. Three constraints can be associated to any node of an elementary tree : null adjunction (NA), obligatory adjunction (OA), and selec-tive adjunction (SA). Because of the formal properties of adjunction, the formalism is more powerful them Context-I~ee Gran~nar, .but only mildly so/Joshi 85/. Most of its linguistic properties come from the fact that it factors recursion from local dependencies. We are thus able to local-ize all dependencies such as subcategorization, agreement, and filler-gap relations. Because trees, and not categories, are considered ms the units of the grammar, TAGs have a broader domain of locality than usual phrase structure rules.","We have added substitution to the formalism, essentially for descriptive purposes. Although adjunction is more powerful than substitution, and could be used to simulate it, it seems more natural to have substitution itself for lexical insertion and for constructions in which the extra power of adjunction is not needed (section 2). We define a restrictive use of substitution: it inserts an initial tree (or a tree derived from an initial tree), or a lexieal tree, into an elementary tree. Substitution is always obligatory and only one constraint, selectional substitution, is defined. This improves the descriptive power of the formalism without changing its generative capacity.","Features structures can be associated with each node of an elementary tree /Vijay-Shanker 87/. They permit the dynamic assignment of constraints. Features are also used for constraining the lexieal insertion of items such as prepositions in verbal complements, coinplementizer of sentential complement or determiner in NP.","Our grammar currently covers the major basic and derived constructions, such as wh-question, relativization or cleft-extraction. We are also able to handle neutral and reciprocal verbs, middle and locative alternations , as well as argument reordering such as scrambling or heavy-NP shift. We refer the reader to /Abeilld 88b/ for a more complete presentation of the grammar. In this paper, we focus on some constructions which are of particular linguistic significance."]},{"title":"1 Elementary trees and minimal linguistic structures","paragraphs":["Our framework is that of a lexicon-grammar /Gross 75/ and /Gross 81/. We view all basic structures as being produced by a lexical item in the lexicon. We adopt the notation of/Gross 75/and/Boons , Guillet, Lecl~re 76/. In this framework, as in a TAG, the linguistic unit is the sentence. We define 40 basic structures for French : 12 for verbs taking NP essential complements, and 28 for verbs taking sentential complements.","1.1 Elementary trees for basic constructions Each of the first i2 structures are represented in the grammar by three initial trees corresponding to declarative sentences, complement clauses, and infinitive clauses.

The structures a2 and a3, which would otherwise yield incomplete sentences, bear an obligatory adjunction constraint on their root-nodes. We have to differentiate trees with infinitive from trees with tensed verb, because lexical insertion is defined on already inflected items, and because French does not allow lexical subject in infinitive clauses. We thus state this constraint as a basic structure of the grammar : in a3, the subject has to be non lexical (PRO).","A verb is thus defined by its syntactic argument structure, and the corresponding set of trees are associated with it. We refer to a given argument structure as a tree-family. The optionality of a given argument and the lexical value of the preposition (for verbs taking prepositional complements) are noted as part of the argument structure. A verb with more \"than one possible argument structure will be duplicated. /Gross 81/shows that French verbs have no more than three essential arguments, including the subject. 2","IIaving such trees associated with the lexical items, in-stead of a standard argument structure in the form of a list (or of a feature) and rules for sentence formation, provides us with an extended domain of locality that has interesting linguistic consequences. We do not manipulate basic categories, but tree-structures corresponding to minimal sentences (for a verb, or a predicative noun) or complete constituents (NP, for a non-predicative noun, AP, for a modifying adjective). We are thus able to state cross-level","1For simplification, we do not put all the adjunction constraints these trees bear at their different nodss.J, marks substituti~a.","2Leaving apart such examples as Jean parle 1 O0 F d Marie que Pierre viendra, which can undergo some kind of reanalysis. It is not]always easy to distinguish essential complements from adjuncts altl~ough our formalism requires a clear-cut distinction. 8 dependencies often overlooked in grammars, because they can only be defined on the sentence as a basic unit. For example, the value of the determiner of the subject may depend on the verb, as shown in 1-2, but it also depends on the presence of a verbal complement in 3 ; the adjunction of the right adjective on the nominal complement depends on the lexical value of the verb in 4-5 : 1) * Ce mot rime. ~) Ces roots riment. 3) Ce mot rime avec \"banane'. 4)*Jean mange un fntur g~teau. /Gross 81/ 5) Jean pr@are un futur gdteau, s Lexical insertion, or adjunction of adverbs or modifiers such as relative clauses, depend on each element of the elementary tree, and not on just the immediately dominating node. They are difficult to capture by CFG rules such as S-+NP VP, or VP-*V NP.","1.2 Elementary Trees for Derived Constructions In a TAG, the standard derived constructions are represented as elementary trees of the grammar. They are part of the tree family associated with a verb. Their properties are those of elementary trees, which must be complete structures and have;, their gaps bounded in the same tree they appear in, plus the properties given by adjunction and substitution, respectively. If one considers the principles that are used for designing such families, these principles will correspond to syntactic rules, or 'transformations', in derivation-based theories of grammar. Wh-question gives rise to the corresponding wh-elementary trees for each of the arguments of an elementary tree.

Relative clauses are represented as auxiliary trees rooted in NP which can then adjoin to the NP node they modify. Each elementary tree, corresponding to a declarative sentence, has thus corresponding auxiliary trees rooted in NP. Cleft-extraction is also represented by elementary trees. To say that a tree with a wh-element, or a relative pronoun, must he an elementary tree, derived from another elementary tree, provides us with strong predictions: wh-movement is forced to apply only to elements present in an elementary tree, that is to arguments of our basic linguistic structures, and not to adjuncts.","3*Thls word rhymes.

They are represented as features associated with the proper verb, and correspond to sets of trees to be added to the tree family of the verb. One should notice that the verbal item to be marked is in fact a pair (lexical entry, argument structure).

We use for this purpose substitution as an alternative operation. It replaces the leaf node of an elementary tree with an initial, or a lexical, tree (or a tree derived from an initial tree), provided it has a root-node of the same category as that of the leaf-node of the elementary tree.","Let us compare the linguistic properties derived from substitution and adjunction respectively. Substitution represents embeddment as the insertion of a complement clause at a leaf node of the matrix clause. Adjunction views it as the insertion of a matrix clause at any node of a complement clause. Constraints on the derivation are put in the matrix clause, when using substitution, and in the complement clause when using adjunction. Comple-ment clause which undergo wh-movement must be composed with their matrix clause by adjunction, because the matrix clause has to be inserted at an interior node (between the Wh-element and the complementizer). If one uses substitution, on the other hand, insertion at an interior node will be blocked, and wh-movement out of the complement clause will be ruled out. Both operations are therefore complementary; in order to know whether to use one or the other, one has to ask whether wh-movement out of the embedded clause is possible or not.","In the case of verbs taking both a sentential subject and a sentential object, we use substitution to represent the subject clause. This makes the well-known sentential-subject island constraint fall out from the formalism. We generate for example 11 and rule out 12: 11) Qne Marie aiile en Gr&e ennnie Jean 12) *Ofii qne Marie aiile el ennuie-t-ii Jean ? s The verb ennnyer is associated with the argument structure So V NP1, which is represented as an initial tree 9.
