Linguistically \"Interesting\" problems are thos~ for which there are no obvious solutions, and reasonably sophisticated theories are required to solve them, or those behind which there are general linguistic pdnclples, and a small number of general rules can cope wtth them (e.g., relatlvlzatlmr, causativlzation, ambiguity, movement, garden-path, etc). On the other hand, linguistically \"uninteresting\" problems are these for which there extst obvious solutions, or those behind which there Is no general linguistic principle, and It Is Just a matter of writing and adding rule,J to cope with these problems (e.g., punctuation, date and time expressions, Idioms, etc).","Ftgures 3 and 4 show example \"Interesting\" and \"uninteresting\"","problems, respectively.

In (computational) linguistic literatures, uninteresting problems can be Ignored, as long as everybody agrees that there are obvious solutions for them. In practical applications, on the other hand, we cannot ignore uninteresting problems, or systems simply do not work. One of the projects at the Center for Machine Translation at","Carnegie-Mellon Unlverslly Is to translate personal computer","manuals from English to Japanese and from Japanese to Englisb.","In this project, and perhaps in ally other practical projects that have","to deal with \"real\" sentences, the system's failures are caused by a","few Interesting problems and tons of uninteresting problems. There","often exist reasonable approximate solulions to Interesting problems","lu practical applications; Ior example, it Is quite acceptable to","assume that there are no embedded relative clauses In computer","manuals, In order to simplify the (Interesting) problem of","relatlvizatlon. On the other band, there are no quick solutions to","uninteresting problems other than writing a bench of rules. • We can never anticipate and prepare for all of these unleteresting problems in advance. It seems as if there will be always these problems no matter how carefully and how many times we test and debug the system and Its grammar. • The quantity of the knowledge sources (i.e., grammars/rules) has to be very large; unlike Interesting problems, rules for uninteresting problems can hardly generalized into a smaller number of rules, as each of them represents an uninteresting problem with no general linguistic principles behind it. • It Is more difficult for humans Is test, debug, and maintain a larger amount of knowledge sources accurately and consistently. ~, II Is more difficult for a system to access a larger amount of knowledge sources efficiently. These problems are much more serious than linguistically \"Interesting\" problems, and directly affect performance of practical syste~ns. 453"]}]}
