However, when natural language processing applications seek to draw on the results from new developments in theories of grammar, not only the nature of the tools has to change, but they face the challenge of reconciling the seemingly contradictory requirements of notational perspicuity and efficiency of performance. In this paper, we present a comparison and an evaluation of a number of software systems for grammar development, and argue that they are inadequate as practical tools for building wide-coverage grammars. We discuss a number of factors characteristic of this task, demonstrate how they influence the design of a suitable software environment, and describe the implementation of a system which has supported efficient development of a large computational grammar of English? 1. Tools for Grammar Development","A number of researzh projects within the broad area of natural language processing (NLP) and theoretical linguistics make use of special purpose programs, which are beginning to be known under the general term of \"gm.nmar development environments\" (GDEs). Particularly well known examples are reported in Kaplan (1983) (see also Kiparsky, 1985), Shieber (1984), Evans (1985), Phillips and Thompson (1985), Jensen et al. (1986) and Karttunen (1986). In all instances the software packages cited above fall in the class of computational tools used in theoretical (rather than applied) Projects. Thus Kaplan's Grammar-writer's Workbench is an implementation of a particular linguistic theory (Lexical Functional Grammar;, Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982); similarly, Evans' ProGram incorporated an early version of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG, Gazdar and Pullum, 1982), whilst PATR-II is a \"virtual linguistic machine\", developed by Shieber as a tool for experimenting with a variety of syntactic theories.","These systems differ in their goals. Particular implementations of a theory may be used for observing how theory-internal devices interact with each other, or to maintain internal consistency as the grammar is being developed. On the other hand, formalisms for encoding linguistic information in a uniform way underpin effm~s to compare and evaluate alternative linguistic theories (Shieber, 1987). Neither type O f system is adequate to the task of grammar development on a large scale or for incorporating such a grammar into a practical NLP system, due to factors such as efficiency of encoding (largely neglected in such systems) or verbosity and redundancy of the formal notation. Within the frameworks of their aecomodating projects, these are in no way inadequacies of the computational tools; still, the applicability of the tools remains limited outside the strictly theoretical concem. developed at Yorktown Heights (Jensen et al., 1986). Both are capable of impressive coverage and this is, to some extent, due to the more flexible formalisms employed. A common feattne of these formalisms is that they all fall prey to what Kaplan 0987) refers to as \"the procedural seduction\" of computational linguistics: whatever the basis for the notation is, it incorporates a handle for explicit intervention into the interpretation of the grammar at hand.","Sometimes the nature of the task for which the g~ammar is being developed justifies a form~J notation incolporating 'hooks' for explicit procedures. Thus a number of matchine translation (MT) projects~ especially ones employing a ~ransfer strategy, make use of format systems for grammar specification, which, in addition to mapping surface strings into con~esponding language structures, identify operations to be associated with nodes and / or subtrees (Vauquois & Boitet, 1985; Nagao et al., 1985).","In general, the effects of the temptation to allow, for example, the EVALuation of arbitrary LISP expressions on the ares of the ATN or the addition of \"procedural programming facilities\" to the rule-based skeleton of 1BM's PLNLP have been discussed at length in the recent literature addressing the issues of declarative formalisms from a theoretical perspective (see Shieber, 1986a, and references therein). However, from the point of view of developing a realistic grammar with substantial coverage, the opening of the procedural 'back door', while perhaps useful fo: 'patching' the inadequacies in the linguistic theory during the exercise, can turn the whole process of grammar development and maintenance into an orgea~isational nightmare, as side effects accumulate and ripple effects propagate.","A ~parate problem with allowing procedural attachment into the grammar formalism stems from the inevitable commitment to a particular version of a particular theory. Even wben a deliberate effort is made to develop a flexible and general framework capable of accomodating a range of 'underlying' linguistic operations, such a framework is bound eventually to become inadequate, especially as modem theories of grammar (strive to) become more declarative and tend to make reference to larger bodies of knowledge. A case ha point is the ARIANE system (Vauquois & Boitet, 1985): even though it was designed as a completely integrated programmaing environment, with the aim of enabling implementation of, and experimentation with, different linguistic theories, in reality the system has been unable to cope with radically new grammatical frameworks and computational strategies for text analysis.","The question then arises of the optimal way of developing a practical grammar. This paper will report on our experience in building such a grammar, with a particular emphasis on how a number of constraining factors have influenced the design and implementation of the software tools for supporting the linguist's work. 2. Design Considerations","On the other hand, a number of syntactic formalisms have been used to develop wide-coverage grammars for use in practical NLP systems. The best known of these is the Augmented Transition Network formalism due to Woods (1970). More recent examples are the DIAGRAM grammar (Robinson, 1982) of SRI's TEAM natural language interface (Grosz et al., 1987) and the PEG grammar Currently with the IBM (UK) Science Centre. The work described here was supported by research grant GR/D/87321 from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council.","For the last two yearn we have been engaged in a project aimed at substantial grammar development, as part of a larger effort to produce an integrated system for wide-coverage morphological and syntactic analysis of English. The overall objectives of tile combined effort arc described in a number of papers (see Russell et at., 1986; Phillips arid Thompson, 1987, and Briscoe et al., 1987). We aimed to achieve comprehensive coverage of English in two years, using only one linguist and one programmer full-time; the complete natural language toolkit was to be made available to the research community outside the immediate enviromnent whetx~ the grammar was being developed. Consequently, the software support for the linguist had to exhibit a number of characteristics to encourage high productivity, Particularly 54 critical among these are e.flicieney of implementation, perspicuity of rewesentatlon, ease of use and robt, stness of pofo~mance.","Current theories of syntax have much to otter to practical systems; such theories, however, are under coustant development. For veu¢ pragmatic reasons, a project like outs ought to exploit a developed theory, For equally pragmatic reasons, it ought to be able to take advantage both of developments within the particular theory and of the evolving treatment of wuious linguislie phenomena. The question of tim relationship between the thcoretic~d Rn'malism and the formalism adopted m implement a practical grammar based on that theory then becomes of ceutral iml;~)rtance. For i~stance, it would bc inappropriate to adopt a direct imp!ementation of, say GPSG, since tire rate of change of the theory itself is likely to make such an implementation obsolete (or at least incapable of irmorporating subsequent linguistic analyses) quite rapidly - . file bdcf lifcspan of Ewms' ProGram is a case in point. ()nly when theou and grammar are beiug developed in very close collaboration, or even wifltin the same group -- - as in, for example, the })ewlctt.-Packard NLP project, whose cornerstotm is the linguistic framewolk of Head-Driven t'hrase Structm'e Grannnar (Proudian and Pollard, 1985; PollaN aud Sag, 1987) -- could such ~ul approach work.","l}owever, itr mJ effint like om\"a, it is of critical impmtauce to strike the right balance between i)eit~g failhfu[ to the spirit nf a tbeo~y mid being uncommii:ted with respect to a particular vcrsien of it, as well as remaiuing tlexiNe within tile overall iianlcwoN of 'close' or related theories. Attempts to be too flexible, however, arc iikely to lead tit situations of wqich the PATII..II system is an example: the ability to model a wide t' rage of theoretical devices and mr(lyrical ti'amcworks is penalised by its unsuitability \"for any major attempt at building natural-language grannnars\" (Shicber, 1984:364). 3o Our App~'ot4ch","For a varict~/ of rea:;ons0 iuiollectual ~aid pragmatic, we chose to carry out the ~:rammar devclopnmni within ihe li'amewofl~ of GPSG (see Bogm'aev, 1988, iir mine detail~;).

In order to achieve implementability, tire interpretation of the GPSG lonnaiism ~equires a number of ms|dcfions. In order to provide flexibility and expressive power, the lbn~alism itself needs a nmnber of extensions. In this light, the design of software support for gr~:urunar development becmnes similar to the task of designing a special tin,pose, high level computer hnlgtlage, lollowed by an h~qfl~mentatkm of an interactive programming oMiomnent for it. 3,1 7he Formalism","The gmmma,\" specification formalism, presented in detail in Can'o]l et al. (1988), i~; in flint a metaogrummaticN formalism which avoids tire direct implementatimr of one particular synlactie lheory. While remaining close to the nf:~talion of GPSG, this formalism is nonethc!es:~ capable of specifying a range of syntactic thcoxie.,', and grammars. The specific choices during he design of such language have been heavily influenced by tile desire to be moderately committed to a theoretical framework without being unrteeessafily constrained wit(fin that framework. Fielding the fight balance places out' system half way between the extreme positions exemplified by ProGram and the Grammar..wliter~s Workbench, on the one hal(!, and PATR-II, on tire other.","The recta-grammatical lbrmalism is designed to sttpl×ut a pariictdar model of grammar development, suggested by, for example, Kay (1985). We maintain clear separation between a recta-grammar, which is \"the seat of linguistic universals\" (Kay, 1985:276), and an equivalent (in the sense that it describes exactly the same language) object grammar, coupled directly to the l)alscr. The process of compiling the fonner into the latter constitutes the core of otlr GI)E. A nnmber of iV(l' projects, also seeking substantial coverage, make a seemingly similar distinction between a source and object grammar-see, for instance, ARIANE's static and dynamic (or procednraI) grammars (Vanquois & Boitet, 1985). However, there are differences, tirsly in interpretation--the dynamic grammar largely incorporates whatever execution strategy is employed lbr transfer--.and secondly ill emphasis--a dynamic grammar is (necessarily) derived manually Ii'mn astatk: one. Such efforts, then, do not have the notion of recta-grammar compilation, and consequently require less functionality from their suPtx, rt environments. We amplify this point below.","Tim scparatiou between source and object grammars is the key to two of the eousiderations discussed in the previous section. By stopping short of embodying a particular theory, the fonnalism of the recta-grammar provides the linguist with an expressively flexible and powerful device Ibr grammar writing. By assuming a parser, whose underlying operation is based on a restrictive version of unification, the ohject gram,nat allows an efficient implementation. Morn specifically, the object grammar is made up of phrase structure rules with feature complexes as categories; parsing with it is based on flxedarity, term unification.","The recta-grammatical formalism is flexible and powerful. For example, it incolporates rule types for explicitly specifying feature propagation patterns, rather than 'hard-wiring' feature propagation into tile interpretion of Ihe rules (as in GPSG), arid provides a variety of alternative rule formats, for example, PS er ID/LP rules, (non)-linear, (non)-lexieed metarules, and so forth. The meta-grammar can be designed to be perspicuous, flexible aud expressively powerful with little regard lor issues of computational cmnplexity because this complexity 'disappears' during compilation into the object grammar, 1caving a well-defined, invariant and computationally tractable object grammar to be deployed at parse time. The process of compilation is based on ordered application of the various types of meta-grammatical ntle to a set of 'base' PS or ID rules. 3.2 The Environment","The questions of optimal software envirmm~ent fro' supporting grammar development, particularly in a rule-based folanalism like ours, are very similar to the questions of interactive support for program developmant. A ~annber of special-pulpose tools have to be brought together in a lightly inzegrated 'sbeli' and organiscd around the core linguistic 'engine', which performs the reduction (compilation) of lneta- into object grammar. These tools must suport (1) rapid, incremental grammar development, (2) interactive granmar debugging, and (3) version maintenance and control.","The grammar development environment incorporates a number of moduh's, oLganised round the compilation process. In particular, tire core functionality is provided by a morphological analyser, a parser lor ihe object grammar, and a generator. Tire user interface consists of a comntalld line inteqgreter, a number of special puqmse viewing modules for recta-grammatical constructs, and a component for displaying parse trees on non-graphics terminals. The system is designed to be completely portable and machine-independent, which influenced tire deliberate choice not to use any advanced graphics facilities. (These can incmporated if desired --- indeed the system has been ported to both the Apple Macintosh and Xerox 1186 workstation). 3.2.1 Detecting Overgeneration","The need lor a pa~er fro' grammar development is uncontroversial; it assists thc linguist in finding gaps in grammatical coverage, checking the correctness of the syntactic description and weeding out spurious analyses. Our parser provides facilities for viewing syntactic descriptions in a variety of ways and batch parsing a growing corpus of examples to check the consistency of the developing grammar. Less obvious is the utility cf a generator. Karttunen & Kay (1985:2950 discuss the use of such a component to generally explore the predictions made by a grammar concerning particular constructions. 55 However, their approach would not highlight the roles involved in overgcneration, particularly as the granlmar grows in size. Our generator allows the linguist to guide generation either implicitly, by specifying rule-sets of interest, or explicitly, by directly manipulating (partial) syntax trees. For example, if the focus of interest is relative clauses, then she can request the GDE to ignore inappropriate rules (for example, those relating to coordination) and ask for automatic generation of examples with a specified maximum length whose root node is that appropriate to dominate a relative clause. Alternatively, she can build a syntax tree interacfively by selecting the rule to apply from a menu of rule names generated automatically on specification of the next node to expand. Combining the two approaches allows automatic generation, fcr example, of specific types of relative clause; generation after building the partial syntax tree: r,e i NP[+wh] S[SLASH NP] would produce oNectrelative clansessuch as: who every cat liked who kim likes e \" Automatic generation is a more natural technique for aiding discovery of ovcrgencration than parsing, because with the latter it is necessary for the linguist to guess where overgeneration may occur. 3.2.2 Efficient Grammar Compilation","The major potential bottleneck in grammar development is compilation, since changes to the grammar can only be fully evaluated by parsing or generating relevant examples. Complete grammar compilation is increasingly time consuming as the grammar grews; however, it does not have to he performed that often, given the ability to perlbrm incremental grammar compilation. Tile term \"incremental\" here is taken to mean both as little as possible and as rarely as possible. By analogy with high-level languages for rapid prototyping, where disruptions of the program development cycle ale avoided at all costs (consider, for instance, asynchronous garbage collection in Lisp), the intrusion of the grammar compiler into the linguist's work is kept to a minimum. Firstly, gran~mar compilation takes place 'on demand', so that the user need never worry about having to explicitly invoke it. Secondly, even though rules in large grammars tend to interact quite closely, it is rarely necessary to recompile the whole source every time an individual rule is changed. The GDE software caches compiled data to minimise the effort required during recompilation, and, by maintaining a model of the dynamic dependencies between a cluster of interconnected rules, it '.s able to ensure that the minimum amount of cached data is discarded when the grammar is changed. A consequence of this design is that individual components and rules at source level can be declared, and redefined, in any order. For example, the role S --> NP, VP. nmy be defined before it is even decided which features make up Ss, NPs and Vps. The user may postpone this decision until she actually ~vants to use the ride for parsing a sentence. This experimental style of dcvclopmcnt parallels even turther that promoted by highly interactive systems, since it allows easy experimentation with small fragments of the grammar, without requiring, for instance, compilation of the complete source or loading of all declarations.","Incremental compilation is made possible by designing the grammar compiler as a modular unit, comprising separate components for the interpretation of each of the statement types (for example alias declarations, feature propagation rules, or feature default statements) in the source (meta-grammatical) language. This has made it possible to combine these components into an integral package for efficient grammar compilation, as well as m incorporate them into individual commands, directly available to the linguist. 3.2.3 Effective Grammar Debugging","There are two further important consequences of our grammar compilation design. The first is the ability to monitor the effects of grammar expansion, by selectively filtering subsets of source grammar rules through specific compilation procedures. So, for example, the effects of a particular metarule can be assessed by applying it to a specified subset of 'base' rules. The second is the crucial capacity of source level debugging. In a development model which distinguishes between meta- and object grammars, efficient work is only possible if l%ulty grammar rules can be traced back to their original source in the recta-grammar. In our system, the output of a single command is usually sufficiant to pinpoint an error in the source. Nodes in parse trees are labelled with the name of the gramnmr rule licensing the local tree rooted at that node. Unlike some other systems, such as ProGram, the name of an object grammar talc always uniquely encodes the complete derivation path of the rule. Thus, for example, the rule name VP/TAKES NP (PASSIVE/+) uniquely identifies the rule derived from the application of the PASSIVE metarule to the rule introducing vps taking a single NP complement which requires a PP 'agent' phrase (distinguished from the version without the PP by /+). \"Ihus faults in object grmnmar rules can easily be traced back to their meta-grammatical source.","The use of unique rule names enhances the ability to view all or parts of the recta-grammar, as well as the results of partial compilation, along a number of dimensions, by means of patterns, with wild cards ranging over rule types and the names of rules. To facilitate this type of grammar browsing, arbitrary view requests can be constructed by using patterns eompositionally; thus in a particular grammar of ours, the patteru VP/PHRASAL* (*) & =NULL refers to the collection of VP rules introducing phrasal verbs which have had metarales applied to them resulting in the imroduction of the feature NULL. View requests may be further modified by indicating the level of detail required, i.e. whether the rules should be shown in their original source form, or partially or fully compiled.","Viewing parse trees particularly facilitates source level debugging. Displaying a tree from the perspective of role names associated with the nodes, for example that resulting from parsing the phrase 'men and women': N/COORDI CONJ/NA CONJ/NB men and women can reveal whether right or wrong rules get activated. Fully displaying the category structures on tree nodes (Figure 1) gives an indication whether feature propagation regimes have been specified correctly. Viewing the gross structure of the tree, in this case ((men) (and women)) suggests whether the parse is correct or not; furthermore, in the case of multiple parses, nodes with common analyses can be factored out, thus helping localise the source of the error.","Errors are only dealt with at source level; editing facilities incorporate knowledge about file syntax of all constructs in the metao grammatical formalism The process of editing is integrated with extensive bookkeeping, which frees the grammar writer from the task of explicitly maintaining version backups and checks for consistency of the object grammar with respect to a particular meta-grmnmar.","The command interpreter is sensitive to work context and is capable, at any stage, to prompt for input appropriate to the current state in tile grammar development process. For example, if the linguist has parsed a sentence which resulted in three analyses, she can display the category associated with any node of any of the analyses by typing 56","N/COORDI","N[-POSS, +PLU, -PRO, SUBCAT NULL, PN -]"]},{"title":"CON,}/N~","paragraphs":["N[-POS~, +PLU, -PART, -PRO, +COUNT, CONJ NULL,.

One of the unexpected consequences of this design is that it makes the system relatively accessible to inexperienced users and has made tcasible the use of the system tbr educational purposes. 4. Collc|usiol~","The desig, of a software system for grammar development clearly depeuds on 01e linguistic choices for, aud pragmatic requirements of, the NLP task. It is not surprising timt a number of MT efforts, motivated by the need tbr st~bstantial coverage, have implemented their own GOEs. Pethaps file most comprehensive of these is the METAL-SHOP research environment of the METAL MT system (White, 1987), wltich includes facilities for selective viewing of parse trees, tracing of the grammar rules as they are invoked by the parser, and editing the grammar at source. The system makes, and conforms to, a clear-cat distinction between descriptive grammar rules and separate mechanisms for their interpretation, tlowever, since the formal model used is titat of augmented phrase structure grammar which does not undergo auy compilation into object grammar, the fimetionality of the METAL-SHOP GDE, while adequate in the practical context it is used in, remahts below that of the system we describe.","Even though we have worked within a particular theoretical fi'~wuework, thole are genoralisations to be made concerning practical grammar development within the framework of any of the current syntactic thee, ties. In particular, it is important to realise that software support tbr :inch a task does not imply, arm should not be reduced to, tile provision of' a set of computational tools for e.g. gtanlmar editing, inspocting th4; output from a parser, or comfortably interacting with the system..Ln effozt of this scale crucially requi~es critical evaluation of the u,deriylng lingntstle theory, so that the right combination o[ pragmatically motivated and linguistically correct modifications and revisions is ~bund and implementexl, We are not alone in our findings; our approach to making computational sense of GPSG is similar to the (unimplemenled) plvposals of Shieber (1986b) and Ristad (1987).","The system described above is fully implemented and running on a number of hardware configurations.
