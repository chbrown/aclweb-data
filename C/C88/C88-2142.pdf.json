The differences are summarized as clear definition of information and active participations of speakers and hearers in dialogue t~anslation. A new approach to MT, interpretation based approach, is proposed to take the advantages of dialogue translation environments. The approach introduces a layer o/ understanding to MT and can produce less structure bound translations than conventional approaches."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Although we had been engaged in developing an MT system of texts for several years (Mu project [Nagao85, Nagao86]), we were puzzle(| when we examined the data of dialogue translation gathered by the research group of ATR, which is a newly established research organization for translation of telephone dialogues and is now gathering dialogue translation data in various hypothetical sit-","uations. The sample translations gathered by the ATR research group looked very difficult for machines, but we rarely found syntactic structures which make textual translation so difficult, such as long noun phrases or clauses, complicated conjuncted phrases, etc.([Tsujii84] [Tsnjii88]). On the other hand, most of the translations of dialogues between Japanese and English, which were produced by professional human interpreters, did not preserve syntactic structures of their original sentences at all. They were completely paraphrased in the target language and seemed very hard to be produced by conventional tech-","niques developed for textual MT systems. Both translations, dialogue and textual translations, are difficult, but their difficulties are very different frqm","each olher. We discuss in this paper the differences of dialogue translation systems and textual translation systems. Bcausel we do not know the difficulties of recognition of spoken ut-688 terances, we will avoid the discussion about the difficulties of interfacing the speech recognition part and the linguistic processing part~ which we will certainly encounter in spoken dialogue translation systems. The dialogue trmm-lation in this paper is restricted to the translation of dialogues through keyboards, on which ATR is now concern trated. The differences of these two translation systems mainly come from the fact that dialogues of certain types are more goal-oriented than ordinary texts. We will argue that the goal orientedness of dialogues makes dialogue translation systems more feasible than textual translation systems, though they are usually considered much harder."]},{"title":"2 Differences of Environments","paragraphs":["In the current states of the art in machine translation, most researchers may agree that we cannot expect an ideal FAMT system which can translate any linguistic materials in any subject domains. So, at present, what should be discussed about MT systems have to be engineering","problems. We should discuss problems from engineering points of view. That is, we should discuss, first of all, what types of systems or system organizations are economically and technically feasible in what situations of actual translation, and what sorts of human aids can be expected in","real application environments. The important consideration is how to design feasible MT systems which can be used in actual, rather specific, translation environments. Different application environments require different technologies. Therefore, the questions we would like to pose in this paper are: ® Which is more feasible in actual application envi~ ronments, dialogu e translation systems or textual translation systems ? ,., ()~m ,ee design a feasible dialogue translation system iu.~t by extending or modifying current MT tech- ~,ologies dew'loped exclusively fur textual translation ? Our an:~wer tothe first question, though it might sound sirs.age, is that diah)gue translation :ffstems of certain ~ype.~; are more feasible than textual translation systems which are ( urrently developed aud connnereially a,vailable. ~i, might b:~' the case that we imagin dialogue translation is ea:;ier, t ecause we have been engaged in developing a t( x£1~d ~,ranslatiou system ~md have recognized many, not o~dy diiiicl,lt but ala~ m~ty a~d dirty problems iu textual tra,slatiou systems ([Nakamura86]). l~ut ned only because of that, we believe dialogue trans-I~,tioi~ syst:..ms are more feasible, mainly because of the ba~sic diffe~eu(:es of environments where these two tyl)e~; of systems will be used. We can summarize the differences of environments in wMch th(',e two types of systeuts might be used as fbllows. ~, Clear Deflnifiou of lnfo',malio'n : In certain types of di~,.logue translations, we can define rather clearly what iuformaliou should be transmitted tiom source se:atea(:es to target translations, while we generMly cannot in textual translation. By c~:rtain types of diMogues, we mean here the dialogues such as dialogues for hotel reservation and coul:erence registration which are currently picked up by the ATR research group, dialogues between patients and doctors tried by the CMU group (['romita86]), etc. o Actiw~ Pavlicipalious o] Speakers and Hearers : in most application environments of textual n~ansla - lion .,~ystems, they are supposed to be used by pTv= ]?ssio',al ~','a~tslalo'rs. We camtot have the writers of te~.:ts at the time of translatioxi, the persons who prel)~.rc texts and really want to comnmnicate ,~x)rn~ thing through the texts. The actual readers of trausluted texts are not awdlable, either, at the time of the translation, who.really want to get messages or iufor, aatiou eucodM in the texts. On tim contrary, in diMogue translation, we have bo~l, ~he speakers (the senders of messages) and the hearers (the receivers of me, ages) at the time of translatiiig m('ssages. These two differences make, we claim, dialogue traits-lation systems more feasible in actual translation environments, if they are properly designed ibr taking these adwmtages. Our answer to the s(~ond question is directly derived ti-om the above discussion. That is, in ordel)to take the advantages of dialogue translation, the system organizations should be different ti'om those for textual translation. Mere extension of current Mr[ ̀tec|mologies for textual tl:anslation will not result in high quality dialogue translation systems by which ordinary people (:a~t communicate with eact, other. We will discuss what implications the basic differences of enviroments have in the design of dialogue translation systems and, substantiate the conclusion that i] they are properly designed, cerlain types of dialogue Iranslation syMems, are more feasible, tex:hnically at least, than the text translation systems which are currently available."]},{"title":"3 What should be translated ?","paragraphs":["Fig. 1 shows a simplified framework of application systems of natural language understanding (NLU) other than MT systems.

Meaning of input sentences are defined in this fi'arnc~ work, relative to the internal tasks that the systems are 6[19 expected to perfor m. In other words, what kinds of information should be extracted from sentences are predefined, depending on the aims of the internal processings of the systems. Understanding is regarded as art extrac-tion process of information relevant to specific internal","tasks. However, the internal task or the aim of translation is to re-express by using sentences of target languages the information of all aspects conveyed by sentences of source languages, with as least distortion as possible([Tsujii86]). The internal task of MT, by itself, does not define what information should be extracted from input texts. It is commonly recognized by linguists that all different surface linguistic expressions convey different meaning. MT systerns, at least textual translation systems, have to extract all the factors relevant to the determination of","surface linguistic expressions. Most of the difficulties peculiar to MT, such as the so lection of appropriate target lexical items or expressions, etc. come from the fact that we cannot define in MT what aspects of information in source sentences are relevant to the determination of target expressions and should be extracted from source sentences• In general, we cannot establish a representational framework which is language universal and by which understanding results are represented. As a consequence, most of the current systems use certain, linguistic levels of structural descriptions of source sentences, such as deep case structures in the Mu project, in order to calculate appropriate target descriptions. Because the structures are far from representing understand-tug results and reflect the linguistic strutures of source sentences, their translation results are inherently struclure bound. On the other hands, in certain types of dialogues, we can define by the purpose of dialogues what is essential or important information conveyed by uttranees and should be transmitted to their translations. Here, we do not discuss about the systems which are capable of translating arbitrary dialogues like chatterings among house wives without any purposes, but the systems which translate dialogues of certain restricted domains as already mentioned, such as dialogues for hotel reservation, conference registration, etc. In such dialogues, we can define important information by referring to the aim of the dialogues. Such important information should be extracted kom 690 the input and properly transmitted to the target. So, the framework for dialogue translation becomes similar to that of the other applications of NLU illustrated in Fig. 1. We can introduce a layer of explicit understan& in~ to MT systems, to which important information of nntterances are related and so, in which results of understanding can be represented in a language independent (but task dependent) way ([Tsujii87]). Some parts of utterances which convey information *mporlant for the purposes of the dialogues are related to this layer and interpreted. Because information is expressed language-independently in this layer, we can expect less structure bound translation results for the parts of utterances. On the other hand, the other parts which do not convey important information need not be related to this explicit understanding layer. They would be translated by conventional MT technologies. Let me show you a simple example from hotel reservation dialogues, which actually appears in the experiments conducted at ATR."]},{"title":"lax 1]","paragraphs":["[Japanese] hoteru( holel)-wa, tomodachi(friends)- to Disuko( discotheque)-ni ikitai(t0 waut to go )-node, Roppongi(Roppongi - the name of the place in Tokyo)-no chikaku(t0 be near )-ga iino(t0 be good)-desuga ?
