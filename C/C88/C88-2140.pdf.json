Tllsre is an explicit \"translation step between these two parts. Language independence is not aimed at, because figure io For a description of the interface as a whole see Buchberger et ai./1987/. We have chosen to base our parser on semantic caseframe instantiation. Such an approach is well suited for a restricted domain parser, because of its efficiency (by avoiding useless parses in case of syntactic ambiguity) and its robustness in the case of ungrammaticality (see eog. Grishman et a]./1986/). On the other hand, relying solely on that method, it would be difficult to capture syntactic generalities (Cog.active-passive transformation), because syntactic as well as semantic restrictions must be specified explicitly for each slot of overycaseframe. This means that for every different syntactic realization of the same statement a different caseframe has to be provided in the lexicon. There are two severe drawbacks to this kind of realization: First, general syntactic properties of the language are implicitly stated in the lexicon entries instead of explicitly in the grammar leading to a possibly inconsistent and patchy syntactic coverage°' Second, the lexicon is inflated because for a single word (meaning) a number of different caseframes is needed.

As for' 4, its acceptability depends on whether we allow a slot in ~he caseframs for \"Stof fe\" which could hold an ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT. If we do, we will get an ambiguity.-- In that case, the system will offer both solutions, using a heuristic which of the solutions to present first° The heuristic implemented prefers flat syntactic structures° AS for' the preferred reading, the CFM realizes it by filling PP/NP3 into the DOBJ slot and (PP/NP2 -. PP/NP1) into the PPOBJ slot of the caseframe for \"bezlehen\"o PP/NP4 has already been filled in the SUBJ slot, se the parse of the sentence has been completed° 7. Conclusion In this paper we have described a parser which is able to deal with a wide variety of German sentences in an efficient and robust wry. This is made possible by two special properties of the parser: First, syntactic analysis uses two 'different strategies, namely an ATN and unification \"to deal with fixed word o~der at the eonsh:[tu~;nt level and free corrstituent order at the clause level rsspectively° Such an app'~'oaeh i.s well suited fox' German, but also for other SOV languages like Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Japanese ° Second, the interaction between casefram~ instantiation and a syntactic parser leads to the possibility of - clear and precise formulation of syntactic","and semantic rules and regularities,","reduction'of entries in tlre lexicon, - flexibility and better malntalnability~ 682 Thus pz'oblems posed by various aspeo'ts of \"tbc; gene:c'al ~o],~t:l,o~'~s which may be aDpllod [:o othec ian[~uages ms we~].lo Aehnow].edge~ent Work on DB- .D][ALOG is done Jointly with Softwa:~c:~ Managem~r!t GmbH~ A-1140 V:ten~s ~ Austr:[a0 It has also been sponsored by the9 Austwia~ Governmer~t"]},{"title":"withJ,z'~","paragraphs":["the \"~-~{9~w~z'::,ur~c~.: S?
