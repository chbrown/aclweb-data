Machine Translation, System. The model is being currently tested An th~ ~srman-Spanish system which is under development in Barcelona and relies upon techniques belonging to the GPSG framework. The central idea is to extract from the transfer part of th,~ phrase structure rules currently used by METAL all the :4elevant generalizable information about feature traffic and control dependences, and put at in form of language-dependent tables. This infomnaticn is then accessed and h~mdled by a few high-level rule operators, called during th,~ transfe~ process, implementing three general feature pz:~nciples. The grammar writer is thereby relieved from the todinus task of controlling all the feature traffic between nodes, this resulting in a clea~er, shorter and safer grab,mr for the system. L- Introduction° ~2h[s paper, presents a proposal for the application of so~e G~3G-based teclu*iqees on the ~.~TAL ~I'£ syst~,~ ~ith the ai~l of endowing the systea with a stzonge~ control in","the ~iransf~r Phase. %%8 ce~tral idea upon which this Yrm~sfer Control ,Lodel is eased is to provide the grmmnar w~'ite~ with a t~.oufo~tabls and safe means fez' keeping as much feature traffic as possible cont~olled in the Transfer Phase of the t~anslatioa process in METAl,. Currently, any kind of feature traffic between nodes must be explicitely stated in the ~'ules, and the same happens ~ith the ck~ild node t_~ansfe~ ~t'ocess (Control Dependences). [(t seems reasonable to think that a great deal of bot~.~ this feature traffic between nodes and the control dependences with~u the t~ansfer phase could be generalized ~ud ~:tated outside the rifles, in form of lan~age-dependent tables which would the~ be accessed by a few general operato~ called in the rtiles (implementing the principles proposed l:elow). The gram~m~ ~riter would thus be relieved fi'e.~ thi~', task, all this resulting iu sho~ter, clearer and less e~e~'p~one rules. ~ost of the ideas conforming the model presented he~:~ have be~a~ t~keu f~:om the ~PSG framework [Gazda~ 85]. The original idea was to directly apply the &~SG principles I;o the syste~b since, basically, ME'2~, disposes of the necessary structure for it (i.e., it is a PS-based systen b and thus, it works with structu~.al d~scriptions [trees] consisting of bundles of featu~e~value pai~s [nodes]). However, the fact that the GPSG model was originally conceived for analysis (transfer being quite a different problem) and that METAL lacks mechanisms which are central to the GPSG model, like LP/ID ~ules, metarules, FSD and FCR, etc., showed the unpracticability of such a direct appruach. This is why the idea became to adapt som~ 0£ the ideas offered by the GPSG (mostly the CAP and the HFC universal feature inst~tiatioa principle~) and we~fo~mulate th~ so that they can be us~!d fez 0an purposes. 2.- Fundmnentals of the NtETAL systet,. METAL is a Cha~t'opar~erHdrivan Phi:ass Stru(:tuz'e based MT system, which reflects the classic MT scheme o~f Analysis, Transfer and Generation phases. During the Analysis Phase, METAL builds from each input sou:,:'ce imlsusse sentence one or more structural descriptions {henceforth trees), consisting of nodes, which in turn consist of a number of Feature-Value pairs (henceforth f~v-pairs), )in the Transfer Phase, the trees obtained in the analysis are converted into equivalent trees adapted to the target language needs. After this, the Generation Phase genes'stem the output sentence/s in the target language , using the transfer trees as input. Apa~-t from the lexical DBs METAL has some 500 PS rules, whose form can roughly be described as follows: 19 <RULE.IDENTIFIER> NODE-STRUCTURE <e.g, \"NP --> DET NO\">","TEST <Tests on nodes to be satisfied in order for the rule to apply> CONSTR <Analysis-Tree Construction part> ~NALYSIS PART INTEGR <Anaphora Resolution part> TRANSFER PART TRANSFER <Transfer-Tree construction part> During the Analysis phase, only the analysis part of the succeeding rules apply, building the analysis tree in a bottom-up manner until a S node is reached. Once the analysis tree has been thus built, the Transfer Phase starts; the transfer part of the rules applied during analysis activates now, climbing down the tree from top to bottom until the terminal nodes are transferred. When the Transfer Process applies on a node N, with f-v-pairs F-V, the child nodes of N are also transferred (and the child nodes of these, and so on, until terminal nodes are reached). Once all the branching nodes dominated by N have been transferred, the transfer process returns control to the father of N, which now bears target-language updated f-v-pairs F-V'. Two tasks central to the Transfer Process are the Feature Traffic (i.e., ,hich f-v-pairs need to be sent up and down in which moment, and from which node to which node/s), and the handling of Control Dependences (i.e., which child node of one analysis tree or sub-trme [henceforth local tree] must be transferred first, in order for other slbling nodes to be able to be rightly","transferred). The two mentioned tasks ere now handled by the Grammar writer in the Transfer part of the t~TAL Grammar Rules through calls to \"low level\" feature traffic operators (i.e., copy one or more f-v-pairs from the root node to a child node, from one child node to another sibling node, or from one child node to the root node). What the present Transfer Control Model proposes is to extract from the rules ell which can be generalizable in this process regarding feature traffic and control dependences end carry it out through calls to a few \"high level\" operators which use information stored in the syst~ database in form of tables stating which f-v-pairs must be present in a given node, which nodes are controllers, end which other nodes are oontrollees within a given local tree. 3.- Basic Definitions. In this section there follows a number of definitions which will be used throughout the rest of the paper. 3.1.- Local tree. A local tree is a part of a structural description which is currently being dealt with by the particular rule which is under consideration. For example, given an analysis tree of the form CLS [I]"]},{"title":"/ \\ DET NO[2] / \\","paragraphs":["ADJ N013]"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["NST N-FLEX in which the number between [] indicates (for reference) the rule which has built this particular node, the local tree when rule [2] is applied would be:"]},{"title":"/No{2]","paragraphs":["ADO NO[3) whereas the local tree for rule [3] would be"]},{"title":"/Nof3I . NST N-FLEX","paragraphs":["3.2.- Types of nodes Root Node [RN]: * The root [parent] node of a local tree. Head Node [HN]:","* In case Control Dependences (see below) exist within the current local tree, the Head Node is the controller node. Otherwise, the Head Node must be egplicitely stated for each particular tree structure, normally being the X(BAR-I) child node, in a local tree d~inated by a root node X(BAR) Notice that this definition of Head Node has been tailored ad-hoc for this model end deviates considerably fro~ the traditional notion of Head in the X-bar theory, for instance. Dependent Node [DN]: A child node of the local tree which is controlled bya ~, Free Node [FN]: A child node of the local tree which is not controlled by any HN. 20 Lexieal Node [LN]: A tt~rainal lexical node. 3°3- Type,~ of Features Head Featlwes [HF]:","* A s~t of f-v-pairs which must be present with the some values both in the Bead Node and in the Boot Node in some precise momenta during the Translation Process. Lexical Access Features [LAF]:","* A ll~t of f-v-pairs Which must be present in the Lex/Lcal Nodes nodes prior to their transference into the target language. Control Features [CF]:","* A sect of f-v-pairs which must be copied from the Bead Node s into the Dependent Node/s after the Head Nod~ has been transferred and before the Dependent N~le/a is/are transferred. 3.4.-Central Dependence Between Nodes","* A H~ad Node [HN] controls one or more Dependant NC~J~/S [DN] within a local tree if in order for the DN/4 to be properly transferred, It/they must have a set of f-v-pairs whose particular values are to be updated with those values borne by the HN after this n~i~3 has been transferred. Bad:really, our notion of Control coincides with the one given by the GKPS [Gazder 85]. Control is a language-dependent relationship between nodes, in which there is a controller node and one or more contgullee node/s, which ultimately subsumes the concept of agreement (subject-predicate, noun-adjective, etc.). In the Transfer Process, nodes which are controllers must be transferred prior to their controlleas, in order to ensure the right agreement b~tween them in the target language. Not:.~cs that a local tree may present different types of Control l~pendences (see Fig. I), with one Dependent Node (the NP[2] z~ode below, dominating a local tree where the NO node controJ.s the DET node for Gender and Number), with two Dependent Nodes (the CLS node dominating a local tree where the NP[$SUBJ] controls both the PRED node for Person and NumSer and the ~DJ node for Gender and Number), or no Dependent Nodes at all (the PP node dominating a local, tree where neitht,r the NP node nor the PREP nodes control each other) : CLS [$so~J] -c ..... > PREy AoJ","NP[2] PP I CD2 I","/ \\ /\\ I I D~-T NO PREP ~ I I I <'-\" I I I I I I CO I I I I I ! ! ! ! ! !

Physically, this information is implemented in form of a LISP list, although this is purely a parochial progra~ing decision. 4.1.- HEAD Feature List [HFL]: It contains information stating which f-v-pairs are considered to be members of the set HEAD. The decision of which f-v-pairm must be HF£D members is crucial to the model. In a first approach, we will adopt a pragmatical criterion. This means that we will include as HEAD features those f-v-pairs which are currently percolated in the corresponding gules, and which we make sure are actually needed for the Transfer Process. However, the aim is to extrapolate from this first approach a (maybe language-dependent) theoretical hypothesis about HEAD Features which enables to state a general criterion to establish the HF membership. 21 4.2.- Lcxieal Access Table |LkT]: It contains L~/~GUAGE-DEPENDENT information stating which sets of f-v-pairs (Lsxical Access Features [LAF]) are needed in order for each (major) Lexlcal Node to be rightly transferred. Xn METAL, Isxical nodes are transferred by calling the XLX operator in the TRANSFER p~rt of the corresponding rules. XLX takes ar~t'~ents specifying the needed target lan@uage stem retrieval information for a given category, whether an inflsxion must be attached to the stem, and the retrieval information for this inflsxion. Thus, the LAT table contains information about Lexical","% Access Features, Inflexion Attachement infoz~atinn (when needed) and Inflection Lexical Access Features (ILAF). In fact, this would be quite similar to the NLX table proposed by Tommy Loomis in [Loomis 87]. Here is a schematic example of the Lexical Access Table: S PANIS II-LA T: LN ! LA~' ! INF ! ILAF ! ........ + ................. + ................... + ........................ + AST ! - ! A-FLEX ! GD NU ! DET ! GD NO V0N ! ! ~ ! NST ! - ! N-FLEX ! (;D NO CL ! PP~ ! Ct C~ NO ! .- ! !

AST = Adjectival Sta~ VST = Verb Stem DET = Determine~ N-FLEX = Nominal Inflexion NST = Noun Stem V-FLEX = Verbal Inflsxion PRN = Pronoun A-FLEX = Adjectival Inflexion CA = Case CL = Inflsxion Class GD = Gender MD = Mode PF ~ Predicate Form PS = Person TN = Tense NU = Number In the case of VST, fo~ instance, the ~AT would indicate that, for Spanish, a Verb Stem (VST) Lexical Node must be accessed in the target monolingual lexicon database through the current values of the MD, NU, PF, Pg and TN features as keys, that a V-FLEX inflexion must bs attached to it, and that this inflexion should be accessed through the current values of CL, MD, NO, PF, PS, TN. 4~3.- Control Type Table [CI~]: This table contains LAN~3AG~-~DEPENDENT information stating the Control Dependences for different local trees dominated by different Root Nodes. In this table, for each possible Root Node category (RN), its corresponding Head Node (HN), Dependent Nods/8 (DN) and Control Features (CF), if any, are specified. Here is one example of three CTT entries, one for CLS ~, (with two potential Control Dependences), one for ~- (one CD) and one for PP- (no CDS) dominated local trees : SPANIStI-CT~\\' PI~ ! HN ! DN ! CF ! ........ ÷ ................. + ................ + ....................... + CLS ! ~m [$suBJ] ! PRFn ! NU PS t","! !

The control features (CF) relevant for this structure are ~IU (number) and PS (person). Moreover, a sibling ADJ node may also be a Dependent Node, with control features GD (Gender) and NU (Number). This CTT entry controls the subject-predicate, and the subject-predlcativeadjective (in copulative sentences) agreement requirements, respectively. The same should be stated for each gra~mmtical category which may be a Root Node Of a local tree (CLS, PRED, NO, etc.). %~o things must be stressed about the CTT table: * Information about particular feature values can be given to distinguish between sategorins with the same n~s (for instance, to ensure that for the subject-predicate agreement, the controller is the ~ which bears the role of SUBJect, and not some other sibling ~). * Each CTT entry must have at lea~t a Head Node specified for each Root Node, and possibly ons nz mor~ Dependent Nodes, which may or may not be obligatory, with their corresponding control features. This accounts fo~: the possibility of having different local trees dominated by the same Root Node categoz T (the case of CLS, above). 5.- Basic ]~rinciples In a first approach, three Horkin~ Principles san be stated for the ~TAL Transfer Phase. These three principles are actually reflected in the form o£ thrs~ operators (implemsnted as LISP functions) to be called in th~ transfer part of the rules. 22 15eL }l~eax~ Fea~m'e Update [HFU]","o ~h:~ ~ad Node [i~g] of a local tz'~a ge.t,'~ its ilead Feat~es [~F] instentlated to the values eurz'eutly p:c,~sent in the; Root Node. ~l~?J use~ the ~'h and the C~'~ table infoxmv.tion p:,:~::<rlously uto~'~d into the ~ystem DB, and should he applied p~ciOZ' to the local Transfer Process.
