Parsing steps are indicated by the numbers between the words.","This |roper elaborates the locality principle in de~endency parsing. First, we specify the ideas of local goverm~ent and locally governed trees° Then we describe a ~msic machine and its supporting software as an i~Kolementation of the locality principle for ]~rsing arbitrary locally governed trees. ~]e parsing syste~l has been itKole/~ented for Finnish. Occasio~lly our parser invokes expensive search because no prerequisites restrict trees ( save locality ). We discuss how parsing can be speeded up into linear time if certain rmtural structural constraints are in force. LOCAL CaOVF/RNMENT r LOCALLY GOVERNFa3 'IR~ES, AND DE~PENDENCY PARSING The ideological mlderpinning of local dependency parsing is to focus on adjacent word pairs and see if a binary dependency relation holds between them. The words of a sentence l~ve various attributes in our parser° Some of the attributes have been extracted by a Iro~l~bological preprocessor /J~ippinen and Ylilammi 1986/~ while others are tagged during the parsing process o Local C~)ver m~nt Let <w I w2.. own> be an ordercml list of words° We say that a ~K)rd wj locally governs another word wj if| j = i-1 or i+l anti w i R wa where R is a binary dependency relatlon such that w i is the governor (or the regent) of the pair and .wj is the de~dant° In other words, a word locally governs another one if they are adjacent (at the ~mt of the testing) and a dependency relation holds between them. 275","The governor alone represents its government: once a local government has been established between two adjacent words the dependant is linked with the governor and disappears thereafter from sight. An elementary destructive processing step takes place, reducing the number of visible werds by one (shown by arrows in Fig. i).","Government is transitive. If w i locally governs wj, and wj locally governs Wk, then w i governs w k. G6vernment-is also antisy~retric and irreflexive. Locally Governed Trees Due to the destructive processing step explained above, a governor gets a new neighbor immediately after a local government has been built. This new nelghbor qualifies for a local government as well. A single word may therefore locally govern a number of other words, and two initially distant words may later on establish a local government between themselves. If a word is the governor of several words simultaneously, we say that it governs a locally governed tree of depth one (LGT-I). In fact, we can view a (binary) local government as a LGT-I having just a single branch.","LGT-I ' s are elementary trees. Relational trees which preserve the locality principle and can reach arbitrary depth are called locally governed trees (LGT). LGT's are defined recursively as follows: i. Any LGT-I is a LGT. ii. A tree formed by a word which locally governs","LGT's is itself a LGT.","[~t <w I w 2 ... Wn> be a sequence of words. If there exists a LGT which governs all the words, the LGT is a parse tree of the words. Figure 1 portrays two parse trees. Parsing Strategy In the implemented parser the parsing strategy is based on the following two control principles: (i) parsing focuses first on the leftmost word (the initial word principle); (2) the parser always tries first to establish a focused word as a governor to its left neighbor and then shifts focus to the right neighbor (preferred direction principle).","The resulting parsing strategy is a left-corner-up strategy. The strategy is tuned to efficiently bind prepositional attributes as dependants. TI~E MACHINE We have designed and implemented a parsing system for LGT's. The underlying abstract machine has one focus register and two stacks which bold the left and the right contexts of the focused word, respectively /Nelimarkka et al. 1985/. Locality is enforced by permitting a focused word to bind dependants only from top of either stack - the left stack being preferred. The machine has also instructions for contextual testing. These tests may penetrate the stacks. THE SOFTWARE A high-level language FUNDPL (Functional Dependency Parsing Language) was designed for parsing locally governed trees /J~ppinen et al. 1986b/. A precursor w~s a more procedural language DPL /Nelimarkka et al. 1985/. The system includes a con~piler and supporting progranming environment for the developmental work /Lehtola et al. 1985/.","A grammar description has three parts in FUhDPL. The initial part declares data types. The second part describes valid binary dependency relations. For each named binary relation the user specifies valid word pairs using morphological and/or lexical attribute values. The notation permits concise use of boolean operations on attributes. 276","The third part of a grammar description defines a set of functional schemata. Functional schemata have beth declarative and procedural readings. From the declarative point of view, functional schemata define a set of valid LGT-I's. Each schema describes a regent and its possible local governments°","A local government is either mandatory or optional, and an optional one may recl~ By default the surface ordering of local gover~nents is free. Sometimes stringent ordering constraints exist l~t~een local governments; sometimes it is advantageous t~ give probabilistic information about the ordering of positionally free governments. Such structural information may be written in a schema.","Schemata have also procedural reading which is yet another distinguishing feature from phrase structure rules. A schema actively controls the build-~up of the LGT-I it represents. From the preoedural viewpoint a schema monitors function calls of local governments using blackboard control regime /Valkonen et al. 1987/. THE SEARCH PROBLEM OF PARSING ARBITRARY LGTgS To discover a parse tree for an arbitrary If&T is a complicated search process even in a bettom-up strategy (in top-down problems would be worse)° The basic problem is this: how does an algorit~n know on which level in the hierarchy a given word belongs to? That is, when parsing proceeds from left to right and an attempt is made to establish the right neighbor of a governor as a dependant, the link is possible only if that word is not a governor of a yet incomplete T~To Our left-corner-up strategy occasionally has to invoke coraplex search for this reason.","If a language constrains the structures of its possible LGT's, LGT's become computationally much more economical devices. The problem discussed above does not arise with constituent grammars and phrase structure rules because these rules indicate hierarchy implicitly through the naming of the constituents. CONSTRAINED LGT ' S Finnish is a highly inflectional, agglutinating language. Both verbs and nominals have numerous distinct surface forms which distinguish between different syntactic functions the words can have in sentences. Word forms carry, among other things, such syntactic information which in configurational languages is indicated by the precedence relation. Word order in Finnish is relatively free.","The basic Finnish sentence configuration is SVO. a subject LGT is followed by a verb, an object LGT, and possible adverbial LGT's. Topicalization, wh-movement, and other movements create variations to this basic configuration.","The shape of nominal LGT~s is markedly distorted. They have almost all modifiers on their left hand side forcing them to lean to the right. The most important modifiers are adjectival and genitive° Adjectival attributes modify the head noun iterativelyf as in the phrase (i).","(i) Nuori pitk~ vieh~tt~v~ tytt6 Young tall charming girl","Genitive attributes, themselves nominals~ im~dify head nominals recursively, as in the phrase (2).","(2) X~tSn is~n tySnantajan auto Girl (gen) father (gen) employex (gem) car (A/the girl's father's esloloyer'S car)","Other prepositional modifiers for nouns are quantifiers and demonstrative pronouns. Prepositional modifier types can be mixed (under certain restrictions) as in the phrase ( 3).","(3) T~m~n nuoren vieh~tt~v~n tytb'n vanha kiero is~ This young charming girl (gen) old crooked father (This young charming girl's old crooked father)","Prepesitionality of Finnish is also demonstrated by the fact that postpositions are common but preposition.3 rare. Nouns have also occasional postpositio,~ll nondnal modifiers, but these modifiers can be governed only by the maximal nominal heads of a LGT (the governors which fill the valencies of verbs) or by anolJler postpositionally modifying r~T. For example, the nominal phrase (4)","(4) suuren ~niehen pieni auto talon takana big man (gen) small car (nora) house (gen) behind (a/the big man's small car behind the house) has the I~.I',. ~ shown in Fig. 2.

AN EFFICIENT PARSING ALGORITHM FOR LGT'S The basic left-corner-up algorithm can be modified so that it hierarchically first builds nominal LGT' s without post0ositional modifiers, then LGT's governed by prepositions and postpesitions, then mgminal IGT's with postpositional modifying nominal LGT's, and finally the LGT governed by the finite verb. The structural constraints of LGT's prune search, and it can be p~oved that the algorithm 1~en parses unambiguous sentences in linear time. The following restrictions are assumed:","i o Adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs have nnly prepositional modifiers.","ii. Nouns have postpositional modifiers only on the maximal level. On lower levels they have only prepositional modifiers. AMBIGUITY A~) WELL-FORM~DNESS The modified algorithm presumes that LGT' s are unambiguous. None of the bound dependants should not qualify as a dependant to any other governor than the one chosen. Because the algorithm removes dependants after binding, it cannot cope with alternative relations.","Albeit rich morphology greatly helps to make unique distinctions between different binary relations in Finnish, it leaves some residual ambiguity. The most prominent example is caused by the genitive surface case. That ~mse signals either accusative case, the object of a ~,~entence, or possession. The governor of an adverbial n~i~ also be ambiguous. The basic algorithm solves ambi9%~ity by backtracking.","In their \"pure, form beth algorithms parse only well-formed ]~T's. 'Ilhere are, however, soa~.~ well known syntactic phenomena which cannot be represented by iGT's. TG-theory postulates oertain transformations which result in long-distance dependencies. In modern GB-theory tl~se displacement operations 9~) under the general rubric \"move-alpha\".","For exanple, certain fronting n~vements (wh-movement and topicalization) remove an element and may transport it across clause boundaries onto a landing site in the beginning of the main sentence. A I~T which originally was governed locally becomes distant to its governor and is no more within its reach.","The algorithm can be augmented to handle long-distance fronting movements. At one point the algorithm has built nominal and adverbial LGT's. The valencies for a verb are filled first locally and, if a filler cannot be found, a search is made from the fronted LGT's. The resulting LGT is not well-formed. OONCLUSION We have introduced the notions of local government and locally governed trees to express restricted dependency structures. Their ecmputational counterparts are binary dependency relations ( for local government ) and functional schemata (for locally governed trees of depth one). We then briefly mentioned a parsing system which we have implemented for parsing dependency structures of Finnish sentences. We then discussed how the algorithm can be augmented into a multilevel model which takes into account varying structural c~nstraints in different levels of sentence hierarchies. Linear parsing time ensues for unambiguous well-formed locally governed trees. REFERENC~","Anderson, J.M., Dependency and grammatical functions.
