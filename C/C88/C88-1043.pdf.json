It has been completely implemented on a PC and successfully tested with lexicons and rules covering all of German verb morphology and the most interesting subsets of French and Spanish verbs as well. The linguistic databases consist of a'letter-tree structured lexicon with annc~ tated feature lists and a FST which is constructed from a set of morphophonological rules. These rewriting rules operate on complete words unlike other FST-based systems."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Until the beginning of this decade, morphological parsers usually were restricted to on e particular language; in fact we do not know of any one which was language independent or even applicable to a wide class of non-trivial inflected languages. In the meantime, the situation has changed a lot through the usage of Finite State Transducers (FSTs). Although the formalism of generative phonology seems to be powerful enough to cover almost any language, it is very difficult to implement it computationally. Recent approaches to compile the rules of generative phonology into finite automata offer solutions to both problems. In the following, we report on a successful and complete application of this technique to the morphology of German verbs. To demonstrate its generality, it has also been applied to a large subset of French -- in fact the most interesting cases -- and some Spanish verbs."]},{"title":"2 The Finite State Approach","paragraphs":["As Gazdar/1985/ [1] observed, only very few papers on the mathematical foundations of modern phonology exist. He quotes from Johnson's/1970/PhD thesis [2], the earliest study of this kind, who states that \"any theory which allows phonological rules to simulate arbitrary rewriting systems is seriously defective, for it asserts next to nothing about the sorts of mappings the rules can perform\" (/Johnson 1970] [2], p. 42). According to Gazdar /1985/ ([1], p. 2) Johnson \"proves that a phonology that permits only simultaneous rule application, as opposed to iterative derivational application, is equivalent to an FST. And he then argues that most of the phonology current around 1970 could eitlmr be formalized or reanalyzed in terms of simultaneous rule application, and could thus be reduced to FSTs.\"","At the Winter LSA meeting at New York in December 1981, R. Kaplan and M. Kay gave a talk -- a written account does nat exist -- in which they showed \"how the iteratively applied rules of standard generative phonology could, individually, be algorithmically compiled into FSTs\" (/Gazdar 1985/[1], p. 2) under the constraint that rules may not be reapplied to their own outputs. Such a finite ordered cascade of FSTs can be collapsed into a single FST whose behavior is equivalent to that of the original generative rules (cf./Kay 1983/ [4], p. 100-104). A FST is a special kind of finite automaton which operates simultaneously on an input and an output tape such that it inspects two symbols at a time. In Kay's approach, the FSTs carry two labels, each label referring to one of the two tapes. In general, a FST is said to"]},{"title":"accept","paragraphs":["a pair of tapes if the symbols on them match a sequence of transitions starting in an initial state and ending in one of the designated final states. If no such sequence can be found, the tapes are"]},{"title":"rejected.","paragraphs":["To allow tapes of different length to be accepted, a symbol to be matched against one or other of the tapes to do a transition may be empty, in which case the corresponding tape is ignored.","There are two advantages with this approach: The first is, that such a combined FST can be implemented easily as a simple and very efficient program. Second, unlike ordered sets of rewriting rules, there is no directionality in principle, so that the same machine can be used for analysis and generation as well.","Kimmo Koskenniemi /1983a, 1983b, 1984, 1985/] ([5], [6], [7], [8]) took up this approach and applied a variation of it to some heavily inflected languages, first of all to Finnish. His \"two-level\" model proposes parallel rules instead of successive ones like those of generative phonology. The term \"two-level\" is supposed to express that there are only two levels, the lexicai and the surface level, and that there are no intermediate ones, even logically. Besides its simplicity -- in particular with respect to implementation -- the problematic ordering of rules is avoided."]},{"title":"3 A Parallel ttewriting Variant of FSTs with Feature Unification","paragraphs":["Although Koskenniemi's machinery works in parallel with respect to the rules, rewriting is still performed in a sequential manner: each word form is processed letter by letter (or morpheme by morpheme) such that all replacements are done one at a time. Certainly this model does not depend on the processing direction from left to right, but at any time during processing it focusses on only one symbol on the input tape.","It is precisely this feature, where our approach, based on a suggestion by Kay, differs from Koskenniemi's. Our work grew out of discussions with M. Kay, to which the first author had the opportunity during a research stay at CSLI, Stanford, in summer 1985.

Furthermore there are two participles (present and perfect) and two imperative forms derived from the infinitive verb stem. This adds up to 29 possibly different forms per verb.","With respect to inflection, German verbs can be divided into three classes: regular \"weak\" verbs (\"schwache Verben\"), \"strong\" verbs (\"starke Verben\") and irregular verbs.","Inflection of weak verbs is done by simply adding a suffix to the stem. In the special case of the past participle the prefix \"ge-\" is added too. This class can easily be handled by existing algorithms, like the one of Kay described above.","Inflection of strong verbs is also done by adding to the stem suffixes, which slightly differ from the ones used with weak verbs. In addition to the change of the ending, the stein itself may vary, too. In most cases it is not the whole stem that changes, but only one special vowel in the stem, tbe stem vowel.","This change introduces the problems that make an extension of the existing algorithm necessary.","In most cases irregular verbs can be treated like regular strong verbs with the exception of some special forms."]},{"title":"Example 3:","paragraphs":["\"sein\" (engl.: to be) To conjugate the verb in past tense (\"ich war\", \"du wurst\", ...), conjugate \"war-\" as a regular strong verb.

This matrix is organized in tile following manner:","There are five columns corresponding to the five cases of stem vowel change ill example 3.

A lexicon module which also adds some default intormation to the grammatical information obtained from the lexicon entry. Irregular and strong vm'bs get a group number added to the feature list. The prefix, if one is found~ is compared with the list of permissible prefixes in ttle lexicon.","4. The core of the algorithm uses an automaton and rewriting rules to modify the affixes of the verb. In the course of unification new attributes are added to the feature list. In particular, if the verb is strong or irregular, information about the stein vowel is added to the list. The new information contains an offset into the stem vowel table.","5. The generic symbol is replaced by the stem vowel indicated by the feature list using a single rewriting rule.

Given an inflected form with a possible changed stem vowel, we can at least find the position of the actual stem vowel. We can also strip off the ending and the prefix, if one exists (e.g. \"erwSge\" [infinitive :'erw£gen\"] --~ \"wXg-\"). This leads to a rather peculiar structure for the lexicon. Tile lexicon mainly contains verb infinitives in an encoded form.
