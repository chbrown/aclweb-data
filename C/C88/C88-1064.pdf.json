Entries for roots leave flexlonal elements unspecified and vice versa. The intersection of these two lexicons effectively defines lexical representations of word-forms. 2.

The third suffix denotes the object or the dative case and conforms to a pattern c v( c u(\\ c v)) Nominal stems are given as derived complete stems containing three radical consonants which can be identified, but no attempt has been made to generate them from plain radical consonants and flectional elements because stems are idiosyncratic and better described as lexicalized whole units. Nominal suffixes indicate gender, number and case. Gender is part of the stem for nouns whereas adjectives have an explicit feminine suffix (a)t (the masculine has no marking). Number and case are represented by portmanteau morphs. After these endings there may be a possessive ending according to one of two patterns: v k or c v (c v). 3. Phonological Description","Akkadian, like many other Semitic languages, has a considerable number of phonological and morphophonological processes. This paper describes a fairly complete and tested system of some 30 rules written in two-level formalism and compiled with the TWOL rule compiler [Karttunen, Koskenniemi and Kaplan, 1987]. A number of examples is given below accompanied by rules that correspond to the processes. In each example the lexical representation is given (in bold face) above the surface representation (in normal face).","There are several assimilations word internally and at morpheme boundaries, eg. an N in the root is assimilated to the immediately following consonant, eg. 7re cut (past tense) ': I~KIS ikkis which corresponds to the rule:","\"assimilation of N\" N:F <=> :F ; where F in Consonants ; Futhermore, 'he said ~: IZtaKAR izzakar","\"assimilation of dontals\" t:F <=> :F ; whore F in Dontals ; and %e trusted hint (something) ': i P Q I D - sh u i p q i s s u","\"suffix assimilation of t\" t:s <=> -: ~h: ;","\"suffix assimilation of sit\" sh:s <=> :s --: ; Some alternations caused by laryngeals: 'lord' B a \\ E 1 u b e e / u","\"umlaut\" a:e => E: :* :","• * E: ; 'he enters ' IE aRkUB i r r u b","\"elision of a\" a:O <=> : Vowel Laryngeal: : CollsonaHt \\: Examples of deletion of short vowels: 'good ' oa~lQu dam qu Examples of vowel contractions.
