INTRODUCTION In this paper we will outline an approach to automatic translation that utilizes techniques of statistical information extraction from large data bases. These self-organizing techniques have proven successful in the field of automatic speech recognition [1,2,3]. Statistical approaches have also been used recently in lexicography [41 and natural language processing [3,5,6]. The idea of automatic translation by statistical (information thco,'etic) methods was proposed many years ago by Warren Weaver [711. As will be seen in the body of tile paper, tile suggested technique is based on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are Iranslations of each other. Ill particular, we have chosen to work with the English and French languages because we were able to obtain the biqingual llansard corpus of proceedings of the Canadian parliament containing 30 million words of text [8]. We also prefer to apply our ideas initially to two languages whose word orcter is similar, a condition that French and English satisfy. Our approach eschews the use of an internmdiate ,nechalfism (language) that would encode the \"meaning\" of tile source text. The proposal will seem especially radical since very little will be sakl about employment of conventional grammars. This omissiol], however, is not essential, and may only rcl'lect our relative lack of tools as well as our uncertainty about tile degree of grammar sophistication required. We are keeping an open mind! Ill what follows we will not be able to give actual results el French / English translation: our less than a year old project is not I'ar enongh ahmg. Rather, we will outline our current thinking, sketch certain techniqttes, and substantiate our Ol)timism by presenting: some intermediate quantitative data. We wrote this solnewhat specttlativc paper hoping to stimulate interest in applications el statistics to transhttion and to seek cooperation in achieving this difficult task. 2. A IIEURIST|C OUTLINE OF 'FILE BASIC PHII,OSOPttY Figure I juxtaposes a rather typical pair of corresponding English mid ]:rench selltenees, as they appear in the Ih.nlsard corpus. They arc arranged graphically so as to make evident thai (a) the literal word order is on the whole preserved, (b) the chulsal (and perhaps phrasal) structure is preserved, and (c) the sentence pairs contain stretches of essentially literal correspondence interrupted by fixed locutions. In the latter category arc [I rise on = ie souleve], ]affecting = apropos], and [one which reflects o n = i/our mettre cn doutc]. It can thus be argued that translation ought to bc based on a complex glossary of correspondence el' fixed locutions. Inch~ded would be single words as well as phrases consisting el contiguous or tuna--contiguous words. E.g., I word = mot l, I word = proposl. [not = ne ... pasl, [no = ne ... pas[, [scat belt = ccmturc[, late = a mangel and even (perhaps} lone which reflects Oil = [)()ill\" mcttrc ell doute], etc. Transhttion call he sotnewhat naively regarded as a tht'cc slag¢ process: ( 1 ) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutions (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the corresponding set of fixed locutions in the target language. (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence that forms the target sentence. This naive approach forms the basis of our work. In fact, we have developed statistical techniques facilitating the creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps. While the only way to refute the many weighty objections to our ideas woukl be to construct a machine that actually carries out satisfactory translation, some mitigating comments are ill order, 7l We do not hope to partition uniquely the source sentence into locutions. In most cases, many partitions will be possible, each having a probability attached to it. Whether \"affccting\" is to be translated as \"apropos\" or \"cuncernant,\" or, as our dictionary has it, \"touchant\" or \"cmouvant,\" or in a variety of other ways, depends on the rest of the sentence. However, a statistical indication may be obtained from the presence or absence of particular guide words in that scntcncc. Tile statistical technique of decision trees [9] can be used to determine the guide word set, and to estimate the ln'obability to be attached to cach possible translate. The sequential arrangement of target words obtained from the glossary inay depend on an analysis of the source sentence• For instance, clause corrcspondence may be insisted upon, in which case only permutations of words which originate in the same source clause wotdd be possible. Furthermore, the character of the source clause may affect the probability of use of certain functioll words in the target clause. There is, of course, nothing to prcvent the use of more detailed information about the structure of the parse of the source sentence. However, preliminary experilnents presented below indicate that only a very crude grammar may be needed (see Section 6).","3. CREATING THE GLOSSARY,'FIRST ATTEMPT We have already indicated in the previous section why creating a glossary is not just a matter of copying some currently available dictiouary into the computer, in fact, in the paired sentences of Figure 1, \"affecting\" was translated as \"apropos,\" a correspondence that is riot ordinarily available• Laying aside for the time being the desirability of (idiomatic) word cluster - to - word cluster translation, what we are'after at first is to find for each word f in the (French) source language the list of words {e~, e2 ..... e,} of the (English) target language into which f can translate, and the probability"]},{"title":"P(e, If )","paragraphs":["that such a translation takes place.

Augment the English vocabulary by the NULl, vcord eo that leaves no trace in tile English text. Then each French word f will prodnce exactly one 'primary' English word (which may be, however, invisible). Furthermore, primary English words can produce a number of secondary ones.

It would be expected that some (but not all) French function words would be killed by producing null words, and that English ones would be crealed by secondary production.

It should be noted that while English / French translation is quite k)cal (as illustrated by the alignment of Figure 1), the model leading to (4.1) did not take advantage of this affinity of the two languages: tile relative position of the word translate pairs ill their respective selltences was not taken into account. If m and n denote the respective lengths of corresponding French and l:.nglish sentences, then the probability that 6~ (the kth word in the English sentencE) is a primary translate of.f~0 (the hth word in the [:rench sentence) shoukl more accurately be given by the probability"]},{"title":"P(e,,kl","paragraphs":[".f,,,h,m,n) that depends both on word positions and sentence lengths.

While tile process above results in two-word fixed locutions, longer locutions can be obtained iteratively in the next round after the two-word variety had been included in the glossary and in the formulation of its creation. To obtain French locutions, one must simply reverse the direction of the translation process, making English and French the source and target languages, respectively. With two-word locutions present in both the English and French parts of the glossary, it is necessary to reformulate the generation process (4.1). The change would be minimal if we could decide to treat the words of a locution (,/;f') as a single word f* = U, f') rather than as two separate words f and f' whenever both are found in a sentence. In such a case nothing more than a receding of the French text would be required. However, such a radical step would almost certainly be wrong: it could well connect auxiliaries and participles that were not part of a single past construction.
