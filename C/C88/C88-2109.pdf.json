In this phone of the work accents ale assigned to all arguments of the proposition. The assignment of the accent to the adjective instead of the nou)~ in phrases like \"...den lx~ten...\" involves application ~of the same criteria inside lower level constituents. In order to generate cohesive surface structures it is also necessary to know when to n~ a definite article within noun phrases (the last one : der letzte) or ,oat indefinite pronoun (one : ein). This choice depends on the pragmatic decision of taking one or more blocks and on the; properties shared by the objects in question. Under the t~ssurnpdon that only the parallel processing semantic and pragmatic i,aformation allows the choice of appropriate lexical material. For this purpose, we will extend our set of semantic categories to express if a ce(tain objects is art underdetermined or a determined element of a set. /For an extended discussion see Pignataro 1!187 and Pignataro (forthcoming)/.","The generation model consists of four functions: FI, F2, F3 a~O V~,o ~ maps a illocufionary plan IP and the context C onto a~J ill~mfioa,'a T plan IP' with additional sertumticii pragmatic categories. :i,~ 2 maps IW onto 1P\": i.e. semanticpragmafic catego-a-ices onto to})ie, salient topic and focus.
