VAN SCHOONEVELD","Janua Lingu~ Foundation Ancienne maison Million","Vozerier-Amancy, 74800 par La Roche-sur-Foron (Haute-Savoie) Prance Abstract","Elaborating one of the points of his Coling ~onn 1986 paper, the author discusses prononfn~lity, which is due to a special semantic stratum, singulatire identifieational deixis. Personal, reflexive and interrogative pronouns have additional transn[issional deictic markings, but singulative identificational pronominality alone has a direct anaphorie effect and tends to reinforce syntactically. This ,explains, for instance, German sich selbst.","i. In several publications of mine /van Schooncveld 1982/, /idem forthcoming-A/, /idem forthc~ning-C/ ]i have had occasion to mention in passing the specia] nature of pronouns. Pronouns have their own type of deixis.","2. Deixis is traditionally used for the type of meaning which results from the once-occurring speech act, Sauss~e' s parole, being recodified, that is, being incorporated back into the langue. In adverbs lJJ<e here [~nd now the code refers to actual applications o--o-f--J±self-?- We cannot identify the referent of here and now without taking recourse to our having T~-~tifie~-~he given speech act. 11~e speech act becomes a part of the narrated situation /Bru~nann 1904/, /Lyons 1977,"]},{"title":"pp.638","paragraphs":["sqq./.","3. It is an empirical fact, however, that language can also indicate an identification act which takes place during the narrated situation. Thus we have to do in the preposition out with a space which l~s been identified (an in-spa~ and subsequent].y discarded as irrelevant ~ the next identification, so that \"out\" is the resulting meaning. What is iraportent he~. is that all identifications, subsequent ones as well as the first, may take place in the ~m~ated situation, not necessarily during the speech (the transmission) act.","Do we have to do with deixis in the case of identification in the narrated situation? l~%at depends on how we use the word deixis. If we under-stand by deixis the reincorporation of an identification, act into the code, that is, the prerogation, by the first identifier, of the identification of the referent, then we can speak of deixis also in the second case~ when the entire identification procedure takes place Jn the narrated situation alone. But that is not the way the term deixis has been used traditJo~[].ly by linguists. In the traditional conceptualiza'i:ion, deixis is of a tranmnissional nature.","If~ however, we are. to use the term deixis for any recodJfication of the initial identification of the refer(u~t, including identifiuation in the narrated situation, \"then we must distinguish between mere identificational deixis (in the narrated situation), and the traditional type of deixis, which I call tran~nissional deixis. In pronouns we have to do with a deixis of the identificational variety.","4. Of both types of deixis, transmissional and identificational~ there exist two varieties: m] uTmh~rked type and a singulative tqfpe /van Schooneveld forth;oming-A/. In the singulative type~ all identifications take place at the same moment. Pronominal deixis is singulatively identificational.","Singultative transmissional delxis gives rise to references to the process of the transmission, that is, the pzx~ess of pronunciation itself. It regulates~ for i[~stance, the relation between grammatical morphemes (endings) and lexical morphemes. In singulative identificational deixis all identifications in the narrated situation must take place simultaneously with the first one.","5. It is obvious that singulative ~ansn[issional deixis is the type of deixis which is at the basis of demonstrative pronouns. In \"the framework of the demons±~ative pronouns our vantage point is that of an identifier operating within the narrated situation; in the personal pronom~s the speech si'ttmtion is involved at the same time.","In the personal pronom%s, we have to do with a semm~tie mechanism more complex than that of the demonstrative pronouns. The personal pronouns set up objects as being on a par with speaker and receiver, since they define these objects (referents) further in terms of the speech situation. In using the first person the speaker looks at his own image in the nfirror of the singulative r~rrated situation. Mutatis mutandis \"the same happens in the second and third person.","8. Pronouns in general are n~rked by singulative identificational plurality (plur\"'). Singulative identificational plurality means that there is multiple synchronized identifiability of the referent. A singu]ative (mini-)narrated situation is created. The referent of the demonstrative pronoun 'that' equals a (mini-)narrated situation.","Personal pronouns are, being pronouns, marked by plur\"' , but a further specification (subclassification) is done by transmissional semantic tea hines.","7. At this point, I should mention t]~t I have empirically concluded that Russian semantic values can be expressed in terms of six Semantic features which occur on each of the four deictic levels mentioned; i.~., by 24 semantic features. These features constitute an ordered set in that each succeeding teatime incorporates the information given by its predecessor /van Schooneveld 1983/, /idem forthcoming-C/.",".P!urality, the first feat[~e, instructs the recelver to perform more tl~nn one identification on one object or to identify more than one object. DimensJ~nality singles out from a plurality of identifications a subset which is distinct from its peers. Preidentity indicates that the first identification must be assumed to have been performed earlier than other identifications in the narrated or speech situation. Extension reidentifies an identified element and impl~elative unaffectedness by the identification situation; cancellation signalizes the complement of an originally identified set, and objec~ tiveness indicates that the referent can be at any","frcm the element initially identified.","•","II!","8. The third person is, additlonally to plur , marked by transmissional plurality (plu~\"). In the pronouns, plur\" creates a reference in the speech situation which must not necessarily be identified with the speaker or the receiver but can be repeatedly (i.e. a multiple of times) identified.","The second' person is, additionally to plur\"' , n~rked by (non-singul~tive) transmissionS, dimensionality (dim\"). Dim\" says that there is a subset of elements in the speech situation which have a property in common. What else constitutes a more conspicuous subset of actants in the speech situation than those who actively participate in it? The second person indicates the direct participant in the speech situa-705 tion.","The first person is, in addition to plur\"' , marked by (non-singulative) transmissional preidentity (preid\"). The identity of the referent (the speaker or the central actant in the speech situation) has been established befomehand by an aetant (participant) in the speech situation: the speaker himself.","The next feature in the hierarchy of semantic features is extension. Extension signifies that the referent has already been identified and hence is minimally independently characterized by this (repeat) identification. It is obvious that the reflexive pronoun is nothing else but the variety of personal pronoun that is marked by (non-singulative) ±~ansmissional extension (ext\"). Its referent has already made an appearance in the speech situation.","Is there a personal pronoun marked by (non-singulative) tr~smissional cancellation? It would signify an object which in the speech situation would not be immediately identifiable. It is evident that the indefinite/interrogative pronoun kto 'who' ~to 'what' is the personal pronou/~ marked b--y--cane\". -- 9. SJ~gulative identifieational (plur\"') means a multiple synchronized identifiability which is valid only during the synchronized identifications. The demonstrative pronoun that is marked by plur\"' . One of its eombinatory varl~-~n-~s is anaphora. As Lyons has eoncluded~ anaphora is but a eombinatory variant of the ostensive signification of pronominality /Lyons 1977, pp.657 sqq./. Anaphora is per definitionem contextually conditioned.","Pronominal dimensionalit[ (singulative identificational dJ~ensionality [dim\" '3) will mean that the anaphor is seen as distinct frcm its background. One might say the full extend of the referent up to its outlines becomes crucial. The pronominal adjective all conveys this meaning. -- Pronominal preidentity will mean that with regard to a given narrated situation and its components the referent will be once-oecuringly unexpected; evidently it is the pronominal adjective other that carries singulative identificational prei~6~-~ty (preid\"').","Singulative identificational extension (ext\"') will mean that the referent has alr~n identified and is, in synchronization with this original identification, reidentifiable an indefinite number of times. The referent is indefinitely reidentifiable. The pronominal self (Russian sam [long form s~--~S' German selbst)~-i~ marked bye\"' .","ingu lat iv e i--- l\"-~6-nt if teat tonal cancellation (cane\"') will mean that at a moment preceding a once-occurring nax~ative situation, there has been an identification of a referent but this referent is in the time period synchronized with this identification no longer available for identification. In English, the pronominal which, Russian ~, indicating the identifier'~apability of identifying the referent directly, is used either in appeals for elucidation (that is, in questions, as an interrogative pronoun), or anaphorically, that is, as a relative pronoun. In German~ the eorresponding welch can in addition be used as an indefinite pronoun. ~ which and Welch Work off the naxe~ted situation, w~s the pe~nal) interrogative/indefinite pronouns kto/~to, which/what and wer/was work off the speech Situatl-~0-n.","bb-~tivene--s~ ~-dicates a referent which is identifiable at random. In the pronominal category~ the pronoun any is marked by obj\"' .","i0. In conclusion, a few words on the interrelation between semantic structure and syntax.","The interrogative pronominal ~, whieh~ welch (marking: cane\"\") that is a contextua vv~iant of the relative pronoun refers to an already identified narrated situation, as it should do given the general properties of the eaneellation feature. This pronominal is essentially coreferential. Thus Russian kotor~ 'which' means 'which member(s) of an already ~ven set' and ~hglish which itself also implies membership in a set alread-~-i~entified; the claim of some granmars That which implies a choice between two items is obviously based on the most frequent Jnstantiation of its interrogative usage. German welch used as indefinite pronoun also is coreferentia-~. In Ich babe kein Geld. Has du welches? 'I have no money. Do you have some?' welches can refer only to money~ whereas w~_~s 'whatm--Crs--omething ' ) is inappropriate. In contrast to the singulatively identificational pronominals discussed in section 9, personal pronouns (see under 8) are not coreferential. For instance, in Russian, the specifically interrogative (personal) pronouns kto 'who' and ~to 'what' (plur\"' + cane\") are not c--6~eferential e-x~ept in a few explainable cases (e.g. vse kto 'all who').","Coreferentiality also occurs mn the (singulatively identificational) pronominal expression marked by ext\"', in Russian the short foz~n adjective sam, long (adjectival) form s~f~ in English self ~-d in German selbst. The Russ--lan--reflexive (p~-{o~ml) pronoun s-~, latin se, German sieh is merely the personal-~-noun mark~ by plu~\"~--i--ext '' (see above under 8). It is the pronoun with minimal referentiality and hence maximal coreferentiality, seen direct-. ly from the speech situation as orientation point. The reflexive (personal) pronoun reminds the audience of the existence of a person in an exclusive narrated situation (plur\"') and says that this referent is nothing new in the speech situation -- it is not a person mentioned for the first time. The reflexive pronominal adjective discussed in 9: Russian sam, English self, latin i_2s_e, G~rman selbst~ on the other hand, whle~h--is marked by singulatlve ld~----~entificational extension (ext\"'), does not create the illusion of an individual, but merely signalizes the quality of introvertivity. It signalizes coreferentiality limiting its range of reference strictly to stay within the confines of the given narrated situation. Obviously the referent of the reflexive pronoun is the likely carrier of this introvertivity. Thus arise in various languages expressions which are emphatic parallels to the reflexive pronoun: Russian ~ German sieh selbst. Singulative identifieatlonal deixis ~ ~econd layer of anaphora. Incidentally, singulative identificational deixis can be shown also to provide the struetural basis of the system of number words ~ like two, three and so on~ which are, again, typically ~-~ho~ /van Schooneveld for%hccming-B/.","The conclusion suggests itself that for a description of syntactic relations involving pronouns singulatively identifieational features are a crucial and effective tool. 706 Russ.
