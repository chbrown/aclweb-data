The first type generates sentences from functional structures and the second from semantic structures. The latter works on the basis of extended LFGs, which contain a mapping from f-structures into semantic structures. Both algorithms can be used on all grammars within the respective class of LFG-grammars. Thus sentences can be generated from input structures by means of LFG-grammars and the same grammar formalism, although not necessarily the same grammar, can be used for both analysis and synthesis."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Using the same grammar formalism, or even the same grammar, for both analysis and synthesis is usually regarded as an elegant, efficient and some-times even as the psychologically most plausible approach to natural language parsing and generation. In this paper we want to show that this approach can be realized within the LFG-framework by defining two generation algorithms. 1 The first permits the construction of generators for LFGs which generate sentences from fimetional structures. The second constructs generators which generate sentences from semantic structures.","Both algorithms are based on concepts of derivation for LFGs which can he strengthened in such a way that the derivation can be driven by a given input structure. The principles which underlie the control mechanisms for the derivation arc sufilciently general to also be applicable to other unification based formalisms which allow the derivation of functional and/or semantic structures in parallel to constituent structures (e.g. PATI~ (of. e.g. [Shieber 831, [Karttunen 861) ).","For the generation from semantic structures, a derivation concept of this type can be defined, if, following a proposal by Halvorsen and Kaplan (cf. [Halvorseu 87], [Kaplan 87]), projector equations are used to describe (co-describe) the semantic structure of a sentence. Since the projector mechanism is independent of the specific type of semantic theory, the algorithm works as long as this mechanism is used to build up semantic representations.","In addition, the derivation driven by the semantic structure can be directed by constraints over the f-structure. Usually, semantic information by itself is regarded as providing a basis for generation which is too weak to capture relevant distinctions in the surface form. This additional mechanism could contribute to make the generation more sensitive to syntactic and pragmatic information. Thus, additional fimctional information can enforce a specific syntactic realization, such as passivization, topicalization, extraposition or discontinuous realization of constituents.","It should be clear that the specific constraints which have to be or can be imposed on this kind of generation are subject to empirical studies on questions of syntax, discourse and dialogue. 2 Similarly, for machine translation, one will need interlingual comparative research on these subjects to establish what relevant functional information can be drawn directly from the f-structures of the source text, in order to guarantee a coherent target text. These important empirical questions will not be addressed directly in this paper. We consider it an essential requirement for an adequate generation algorithm, however, that it provides the respective possibilities of control."]},{"title":"2 Generation from functional structures","paragraphs":["In this section we describe an algorithm which constructs a generator for an arbitrary given LFG 3 which generates terminal strings from functional structures. 4 Such an algorithm has to define for every LFG a relation F¢(~,s) (s is"]},{"title":"generable","paragraphs":["from (I)) between directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and terminal strings."]},{"title":"VCeDAG VseV,~ (r,/,(##,","paragraphs":["s)"]},{"title":"/fie(... {","paragraphs":["..... )) Depending on what the adequacy condition C(... 4~, s...) for this relation is, one will get different adequacy criteria for possible explications of what 'generation' can mean within the LFG-framework.

This means that one can use only those derivation concepts which make f-description solutions for partial c-structures available in each step of the derivation. The concept on which the following algorithm is based is described in more detail in [Wedekind 86]. According to this concept, a derivation is a sequence of quadruples (e, (I), ¢, C% Each quadruple consists of c a partial c-structure, q~ a partial f-structure, ¢ a mapping from the c-structure nodes into the set of nodes of (~, and C ¢ a constraint set.

The requirements i) and it), which will be referred to as completeness and coherence, n show that the input structure is in fact a complex constraint with a positive and a negative part. The positive part (compleleness), which requires that the input structure (4)in) is subsumed by the derived structure (4),) (4)i,, E 4),), can be made explicit by two kinds of constraints: existential constraints, which demand that COMPa: all paths of the input structure are derived, and reentrancy constraints, whicb demand that COMPb: all reentraueies of the input strneture are derived) 2 Tim negative part (coherence) which demands that COH: the derived structure is subsumed by the input structure (4),, L (bl,) ensures that the f-structure of the generated string is the unique minimal structure that satisfies the completeness constraints expressed by the input structure. • The central problem of generation designed o.s structure driven deriwv tion is the control of the fidfillment of these conditions.

The start entity contains an empty set of constraints, since not all constraints expressed by the applied rules can be checked immediately (e.g. pure functional constraints) and have to be added to this set until they can be checked. So Fig. 9","The derivation can be constrained by a set C ~°~ of pure functional and/or inter-modular constraints of the form (g p) =, (0 f) et .... d (~ a q) =, (0 p a) which enforce the derivation of those sentences, whose f- and a-structures fulfill these constraints.

Fig. 10 gives an example. ¢ tr Fig. 10","Again a crucial restriction follows from the fact that these rules permit the derivation of structures with an unconnected semantic substructure, which becomes connected in later steps of the derivation by means of inter-modular equations. If a constellation is derived by means of these rules, as it is given schematically in fig. 11, Fig. 11 the generation by expansion of V proceeds without control by the input structure as long as the semantic structure introduced by V remains unaccessible. The coherence-condition is undermined and sentences can be generated whose semantic structure is not subsumed by the input structure.","The coherence-condition can be checked, however, if only those rules are applied which preserve the connectedness of the semantic structure derived so far. This restriction on the order-freeness of the rule application does not affect the adequacy condition (**), because in each derivation step of a sentence with a connected semantic structure there must he at least one node of the partial c-structure which is expandable in such a way that the expansion preserves the connectedness of the partial semantic structure. If the expansion of every terminal node violated this connectedness condition, the semantic structure of that sentence could not be connected. Hence, at least one rule must be applicable in such a way.","Since it is possible that pure semantic constraints of the rule's constraint set refer to semantic substructures whose semantic function is uncertain up to that generation step, not all pure semantic constraints expressed by the rules can be tested immediately. This applies to pure semantic constraints which are constructable from inter-modular constraints by conversion. These constraints contain terms of the form (i a p) (which correspond to (~ a p) annotations) and they are not testable immediately if i is the value for (~ q) (q n ..... pty) (which corresponds to a (T q) --~ annotation) and ¢I*(q) has no a- attribute. Hence, the pure semantic constraints which cannot be tested in a particular step, the pure functional constraints, and the inter-modular constraints of the rule's constraint set have to be collected in C ¢ . The (constraint-driven) generability relation has to then be defined as follows.

Sin fact, functional structures are comtonly regarded as equivalence classes ofisomorphlc transition graphs. We can use representatives of these classes wltldn the definitions without lc~s of generality. Furthermove~ all leaves have to labeled by m, if a fmwtional structure is well-formed. SThis preflxi~ procedure rune analogously for all other types of constraints, in LFG there are constrMats of the form (v p) =c (P q), (v p), (v p) :c z and their negations (~ mid ~, are node indices, q and p are sequences of attellmtea and z is an atomic value). The safi~factlon relatio~ between DAGs and these types of constraints is usually defined as: ¢ ~ (. p) =~ (~ q) ~ 6\"(¢.,p) = ~.(¢~,,q)","~ (v p) ~ 8\" is defined for (~bv,p) For the negative constraints tim satisfaction relation is defined by the negated conditions. For the sake of brevity, I will refer to only one type in the following, whenever constraints are invdved. 1°The relation that is specified by the Wrg-condition between terminal strings and DAGs is equal to A¢. Both procedures are equivalent, since the order which is given by the respective sequence of applications of rules is imposed onto the fds-algorithin, which otherwise is orderfroe. lllt should be noted that these conditions are different from the conditions that an f-structure must be complete and coherent. To avoid confusion the latter ones are called f.eomplete and ]-coher~nt in the following. lathe completeness constraints can be nmde explicit by the path set (COMPs:, existential constraints} and the elements of the irrefiezlve subset of the Nerode relation over the path set (COMPb., reentrancy constraints), cf. [Hesper/Rounds 86] and [Kasper 87]. 13 The purpose of the +-labels will be explained below. 14 Tills presupposes that the unification operation preserves labels, but this was already the case for the atomic values. 15 Within the actual implementation the eohe~nce condition can be weakened. Atomicvalued features can be selected which are excluded from the coherence check and tlnm can be added during the generation process. Again, it has to be determined in a language specific way which features are entirely predictable either front grarmnatical rules (e.g. strllctural case in German, which under a speclfc analysis could be covered by a structural rule associating nolninative with SUBJ and accusative with 0B J) or front the lexical entries associated with certain predicates (e.g. grammatical gender in German which has to be specified for every noun). 1aBut that is only because tile input stnmture is slimmed down for reasons of clarity. 17Defining conditions whidt did not occur in previous definitions are itemlzcd by o. 18Fbr categorial unification granmtm.s (CUG) cf. [Uszkoreit 86] and for unification categorial grammars (UCG) cf. [Zeevat/Klein/Calder 87]. lOThe extension of a syntactic theory by a semantic theol T is called creative iff there are grammars where not all grammatically well-formed sentences are also semautically well-formed; otherwise the exteamion is called conservativv. 20 Within a machine translation system this dropping of constraints could be controlled in such a way that a maximal similarity with respect to the stylistic feahtres of the f-structure of the source language sentence has to he ensured. What 'maximal similarity with respect to the stylistic features' mezms again presupposes some empirical work. al One possible additional condition would be to require that each c-structure constituent must be interpreted within the semantic structure, i.e. each c-structure node must be mapped by ~o a (the product) into the semantic structure. Since we wanted to fornminte the algorithm as general as possible, we dispense with this conditiou. 22Since it is possible to express constraints refering to the mapping a between • and )~ (inter-modular constraints, for exaanple), the refere~ce to &, ~ and ~ is necessary.~ 23\"1\"o separate the f- and a-st~atcture from eadx other wc only have to eliminate the a-transitions. alThe semantic fimction of a gramnmtical function is identified with the semantic attribute, whose value COlTesponds to the a-value of that grannnatical fnnction."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Block 86] Block, R.: Gau a \"Parsing Grammar\" Be Used for Natural Lmlguage Gener- .,tion?
