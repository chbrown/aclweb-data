Word Manager supports the definition, access and maintenance of lexical databases. It comprises a formal language for the implemenation of morphological knowledge. This formal language is integrated in a graphics-oriented, high-level user Interface and is language independent. The project is now in the prototyping phase where parts of the software are pretty far advanced (the user interface) and .others are still rudimentary (the rule compilcr/runtime system). The design of the system was strongly influenced by Koskenniemi's two-level model /Koskenniemi 1983/, its successors /Bear 1986/, /Black 1986/, /Borin 1986/, /Darymple 1987/, the ANSI-SPARC 3-Schema Concept /ANSI-X3-SPARC 1975/ and visual programming techniques /Bocker 1986/, /Myers 1986/: We will focus the discussion on one aspect: the user interfacing for the construction of the lexlcal data base."]},{"title":"I. Introduction","paragraphs":["As i have argued elsewhere /Domenig 1986, 1987a, 1987b/, a dedicated system yields many advantages for the implementation, use and maintenance of lexical databases. The functionality of general purpose database management systems - e.g. relational ones - ls too limited for lexlcal databases because they are not tuned to the task at hand; In particular, they do not provide for a formalism which is suited to describe linguistic knowledge. The reason wily we would like to have such a formalism is that it allows us to take advantage of a computer's processing abilities, i.e. we may construct a lexieal database which is not only a collection of purely 'static' information - a set of entries - but has 'dynamic ~ capabilities. For instance, the latter might be that it can analyse and generate inflected or composed word forms. \"What would be the"]},{"title":"advantage","paragraphs":["of that?\" one might ask. \"It is no problem to add on these capabilities to a purely 'static' set of entries stored within a commercially available"]},{"title":"database","paragraphs":["management system by writing programs in the host language to this systemI\"","The answer is: there are a lot of advantages and I hope to clarify some of them in this paper.

Overview of the user interfacing","paragraphs":["Word Manager distinguishes two quite different Interfaces for the construction and maintenance of lexical databases: one for the specification of what I term conceptual knowledge (linguist interface) and one for the specification of what I call non-conceptual knowledge (lexicographer interface). The former is the place where the kind of morphological knowledge is defined which can be typically found In grammars, the latter is a dialogue-oriented interface for the entering of the bulk of the data.","The relationship between the two Interfaces is one of a strong dependency, i.e. the lexicographer interface depends very much on the specifications In the linguist interface. Much of the machine-lexicographer dialogue can be inferred automatically from these specifications. The formalism employed in the linguist interface was designed to be powerful enough to implement morphological knowledge of several natural languages on the one hand, yet dedicated enough to be easy to handle for linguists. Moreover, it provides the opportunity to experiment with different conceptual approaches within a certain framework. The following section will oufline it."]},{"title":"3.

From what has been said so far, we may infer how an entry into the database is made and what it will generate: the specification of an entry requires the identification of an inflectional rule and the specification of the lexical strings which are represented as place holders in the constituents matched by the rule. Usually, this means that one or two strings have to be entered. From this, the system may generate the entire inflectional paradigm of the word.

This has the advantage thai: the system (automatically) keeps track of the derivational history and therefore the morphological s~_xucturing of each entry. 40 The lexicographer interface Given a compiled specification of the conceptual morphological knowledge defined within the linguist interface, Word Manager may generate a dialogue which guides the lexicographer towards the Identification of the inflectional/compositional rules that must be triggered in order to add an entry to the database.
