Three principles of Government-Binding theory are employed to deal with these problems. They are Empty Category Principle, C-command Principle, and Subjacency Principle. A formalism based upon them is proposed. Translation algorithms are given to add these linguistic principles to the general grammar rules, the leftward movement grammar rules, and the rightward movement grammar rules respectively. This approach has the following specific features: the uniform treatments of leftward and rightward movements, the arbitrary number of movement non-terminals in the rule body, and automatic detection of grammar errors before parsirlg. An example in Chinese demonstrates all the concepts. 1. Introduction","The movement transformation is one of the major problems encountered in natural language processing. It has relation to the empty constituents (traces) that exist at various levels of representation in natural language statements. Consider the following example in Chinese:","~][~, ~ ~ N T o (That book, I read.) The word \"N\" (read) is a transitive verb, which should take a direct object. However, the object \"JJl~\" (that book) is topicalized to the first position of the sentence. For the treatment of this phenomenon, we cannot just write down the rules:","sentence --> noun-phrase,verb-phrase.","verb-phrase --> transitive-verb,noun-phrase.","verb-phrase --> transitive-verb.","verb-phrase --> intransitive-verb. This is because many ungrammatical sentences will be accepted. Thus, we must provide some mechanisms in the grammars in order to capture them. It is still a hard work to do. Several difficulties are listed as follows:","(1) The determination of movement is difficult. That is, an element may be in a topicalization position, but it is not moved from some other place in the sentence. For example,","(Fruit, I like.)","zk~, ~ ~gt ~o","(As for fruit, I like banana.) the first can be considered to be a movement phenomenon, but the second cannot.","(2) The empty constituent may exist at many possible positiofis. For example, given an n-word sentence such as","Cl Wl e2 w2 e 3 ... e(n_l) W(n-1) e(n) W(n) e(n+l)","where w i is the i-th word and e i is an empty constituent, there am (n+l) possible positions from which the moved constituent may originate. That is, for a moved constituent (if there is any), there are so many possible empty constituents to co-index.","(3) Since the gap in between the moved constituent and its corresponding trace is arbitrary, it is implausible to list all the possible movements exhaustively, and specify each movement constraint explicitly in the grammars. 112 The Government-Binding (GB) theory [1] provides","universal principles to explain the movements. Some of them","are shown as follows: (1) Empty Category Principle [7] -","A trace must be properly governed. (2) C-command Principle [7]-","a c-commands B iff every branching node","dominating a dominates/3. (3) Subjacency Principle [7] -","Any application of move - a may not cross more","than one bounding node.","Summing up the above principles, we have to find a movezl","constituent to c-command a trace. The constituent can neither","relate to a u'ace out of its c-command domain, nor match a trace","when more than one bounding node is crossed. Such","principles nan'ow down the searching space to some extent.","For example, (El) ~]l~ tN J~ ~ ti~t'~ ~- ~ To","(The student that the man saw t i came.) (E2)*t m~-N t n~N~ ~T ~9~[~ff~J~o","(* The man that the student who t m saw t n came. )","There is a trace t i in the example (El). Two NPs, i.e. \"N~\"","(the student) and \"~]g~lA. \" (the man), may co-index with it,","but only the former is acceptable. The reason is specified as","below:","(ZI') In,, [s]~. (the man)~ (saw) q }~J (de)~-~i (the student) 1~ (cane)? (asp)","L.~o~ ([~i' ') ~,~the man)[ n, ,[st}~ (saw)tl ~ (de}~-i (the student)]~ (came)]' (asp)","x ~J L.- o.-I The (El\") interpretation violates the subjacency principle (assuming that s and n\" are two bounding nodes). Two traces exist in the example (E2). The traces t m and t n may co-index with the two NPs \"~J~=\" (the student) and \"~]I~{NA.\" (the man), and vice versa. However, both are wrong because of the snbjacency principle:","i-7- °--a (E2') .[s In' latm~ (saw)tn]~J (de}~ nlthe student)15 (came)~ (asp)]~ (de]~[~)~. m (the man) ] L ×-","~ o .-=--~","(F,2' ') Is [n' ~ tm~ (saw)tn]/@ (de)~m(the student)]~ (came)T (asp)]IfJ {de)~[l~L n (the man)","I X~","_","._","I","2.

That is, Xj TR B. The phrasal non-terminal X 0 is the first branching node that dominates A and Xj, and thus also dominates B. Therefore, A c-commands B. Xi=(B>>>A) has the similar behavior. Rules (rl) and (r9) in grammar GBLGI show these <<< and >>> relations respectively. 2.4 Comparison with other logic programming approaches","Compared with other logic programming approaches, especially the RLGs [8,9], the GBLGs have the following features:","(1) the uniform treatments of leftward movement and the rightward movement -","The direction of movement is expressed in terms of movement operators <<< or >>>. The interpretation of movement non-terminals A <<< B or B >>> A is","If A is a left moved constituent (or a fight moved constituent), then the corresponding trace denoted by B should be found after (or before) A <<< B (or B >>> A). It is illustrated in the Fig. 1. The two trees are symmetric and the corresponding rules are similar. However, the rules are not similar in RLGs. That is, the two types of movements are not treated in the same way. For the rightward movement, a concept of adjunct node is introduced. It says that the right moved constituent is found if the rule hung on the adjunct node is satisfied. The operation semantics is enforced on the writing of the logic grammars. It destroys the declarative semantics of logic grammars to some extent.","(2) the arbitrary number of movement non-terminals in the rule body -","In our logic grammars, the number of movement non-terminals in a rule is not restrictive if the rule satisfies the property specified in the last section. The RLGs allow at most one movement non-terminal in their rules. The position of movement non-terminal is declared in the rule head.

The violation of the transitive relation can be found beforehand during rule translation. Thus, this feature can help grammar writers detect the grammar errors before parsing. I13 3. A Bottom-up Parser in Prolog 3.1 Problem specifications","The Bottom-Up Parsing system (BUP) [2,3,4] uses the left-coruer bottom-up algorithm to implement Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) [5]. It overcomes the problems of top-down parsing, e.g. the left-recursive invocation, and provides an efficient way as Earley's and Pratt's algorithms [3]. However, it does not deal with the important syntactic problem - movement transformation. Extraposition Grarmnars (XGs) [6] propose extraposition lists (x-lists) to attack the movement problem, but when to extract traces from x-lists becomes a new obstacle [8,9]. Restricted Logic Grammars (RLGs) [8,9] based upon GB try to tackle the unrestricted extraction from the x-list. They emphasize the importance of the c-command and the subjacency principles during parsing. The extraction must obey these two principles. The parsing strategies of XGs and RLGs are all depth-first and left-to-right, thus they have the same drawbacks as DCGs do [4]. If the parsing strategy is left-coruer bottom-up, the following issues have to be considered in the translation of GBLGs:","(1) the empty constituent problem -","The first element in the rule body, which acts as a left-corner, should not be empty in left-corner bottom-up algorithm. However, the type 1 (b) of rules is common.","(2) the transfer of trace information -","From Fig. 1, we know that the positions of empty constituents are usually lower than those of moved constituents. Because the parsing style is bottom-up, the trace information must be transferred up from the bottom. The conventional different list cannot be applied here. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 illustrates the differences of data flow between top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing. e",": Cl 91 c(i41) cn k HO 1' HI H(i-l) Hi Hi H{i+I} H(n-l) ~ H"]},{"title":",,'","paragraphs":["...... \";,"]},{"title":"A ,':","paragraphs":["........

The transformation of x-list is bottom-up. Fig. 3 sketches the concept. A special data structure shown below is proposed to carry the information:","[In sequence of trace information/X],X] Note a mii variable X is introduced. Based upon this notation, an empty list is represented as [Z,Z]. An algorithm that merges arbitrary number of lists in linear time is designed:","merge(X,Y) :- merge(X,Y,[Z,Z]).","merge([],L,L) :- !.","merge([[B,X]JT[,Y,[A,B]) :- merge(T,Y,[A,XD. In the conventional list structure such as","[a sequence of trace information] even though the difference list concept is adopted, the computation time is still in proportion to ml+m2+...+mn, where m i (1< i < n) is the number of elements in the i-th list. 114","Although our merge algorithm is the fastest, it is still a burden on the parsing. In most cases, the predicate merges empty lists. That is nonsense. To enhance the parsing speed, the merge predicate is added in which place it is needed. Observing the merge operation, we can find that it is needed only when the number of lists to be merged is greater than one. The following method can decrease the number of x-lists during rule translation, and thus delete most of the unnecessary merges:","Partition the basic elements in the logic grammars into two mutually exclusive sets: carry-H set and non-earry-H set. The elements in the carry-H set may contribute trace information during parsing, and those in the non-carry-H set do not introduce trace information absolutely. The transitive relation TR defined in the section 2.3 tells us which phrasal non-terminals constitute the carry-H set. 3.3 The translation of grammar rules","The translation of basic elements in the GBLGs are similar to BUPs. Only one difference is that an extra argument that carries trace information may be added to phrasal non-terminal if it belongs to carry-H set. Appendix lists the translated results of the grammar GBLG 1. 3.3.1 The general grammar rules","The general grammar rules are divided into two types according as a virtual non-terminal disappears or appears in the rule body:","(a) c(Arg) --> Cl(Argl),C2(Arg2),...,cn(Argn)\"","When c is not a bounding node, e.g. rule (r2), the translation is the same as that in BUP [2,3,4], except that an extra argument H (if necessary) for x-list and a built-in predicate merge are added in the new translation algorithm. This predicate is used to merge all the x-lists on the same level. The transformation of x-lists is bottom-up (only one direction) as shown in Fig. 3, Thus, the rule (a) is translated into","cl(G,Argl,H1,X1,X) :-","goal(c2,Arg2,H2,X1,X2),","goal(cn,Argn,Hn,X(n- l),Xn), merge([H1,H2 ..... Hn],H), c(G,Arg,H,Xn,X).","When c is a bounding node, e.g. rule (r4), the","information is used to check the x-list transferred up. Thus, an","extra predicate bound is tagged to this type of rules: cl(G,Argl,H1,X1,X) :- goal(c2,Arg2,H2,X1,X2),","goal(cn,Argn,Hn,X(n- 1),Xn),","merge([HI,H2 .....

If the left-coruer bottom-up parsing algorithm is used,","the grammar rules should free of empty constituents. When","i=0, the grammar rule considers a trace (an empty constituent)","to be the first element in the rule body. It overrides the","principle of the algorithm, but we can always select the first","element c(i + 1) that satisfies the following criterion: (i) a lexieal terminal, or (2) a phrasal non-terminal, or (3) a phrasal non-terminal in a movement non-terminal,","to be the left-comer and put the trace inforumtion into an x-list","before this non-terminal. Thus, the translation is generalized as","follows (assume that cl is a left-comer ).","ci(G,ArgI,H1,X1,X) :.. goal(c2,Arg2,H2,X 1,X2), goal(ci,Argi,Hi,X(i- 1),Xi), goal(c(i+l),Arg0+l),H(i+l),Xi,X(i+l)), goal(cn,Argn,Hn,X(n-l),Xn), merge([H1,H2 .....

The position in x-list is reflected from the original rule.","3°3.2 The leftward movement grammar rules","The leftward movement grammar rnles can be","generalized as below:","c(Arg) o-> c 1 (Arg 1),c2(Arg2) .....","ci(Argi)<<<trace(TraceArg),c(i+ 1)(Arg(i+ 1)) .....","cn(Argn).","The rule (rl) is an example. Its translation is shown as","follows:","cl(G,Argl,H1,X1,X) :- goal(c2,Arg2,H2,X1,X2), goal(ci,Argi,Hi,X(i-1),Xi), goal(c0+l),Arg(i+l),H(i+l),Xi,X(i+l)),","goal(cn,Argn,Hn,X(n- 1),Xn),","merge([H(i+l) .....

The cut trace implements tile c-command principle, and its definition i~.","cnLtrace(Trace,[Y,X],[Y 1,X]) :-","(var(Y),!,","(l'race=x(TraceIn fo,Bound,left), !;fail);","cut traceaux(Trace,Y,Y1)).","cnLtraceaux(Trace,[TracelXs],Xs) :- !.","cut traceaux(Trace,[HIX],[HIY]) :-","(vat(X),!,","(Trace=x(TraceInfo,Bound,left),!;fail);","cut_traceaux(Tracc,X,Y)). The cut trace tries to retract a trace from x-list if a movement exists. ~landarin Chinese has many specific features that oilier languages do not have. For example, topic-comment structure does not always involve movement transformation. The first cut traeeauz chmse matches the trace information with the x-list ~ransferred f,'om the bottom on its right part. The second cut traceatrc tells us that if the expected leftward trace cannot ma~h one of the elements in the x-list, then it will be drop out. The x-list is not changed and transferred up. The concept is demonstrated in Fig. 4. It also explains why we can detect grammar errors before parsing. In summary, each movement non-terminal is decomposed into a phrasal non-terminal and a vimml non-.tet~ninal. The phrasal non-terminal is translated the 'same as before. The vktual non-terminal is represented as","x( tr ace(l YaceA r g ),Bound, left ) in this case, however, cut_trace is involved instead of merge. 3.3.3 The rightward movement grammar rules","Because we treat the leftward and the rightward movement grammar rules in a uniform way, the translation algorithm of both are similar.
