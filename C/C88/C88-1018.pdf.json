The addition of uni/ication to these two frameworks allows a simple account of intexaction be,.wcen different linguistic levels within a constraining, monostraml theory. The resulting, computationaUy efticient, system provides an explicit formal framework for linguistic description, widfin which large fi'agments of grammms for French aud English have ah'eady been developed. We present the for-mai basis of UCG, with i.dependent definitions of well-. toxmedness fol syntactic and semantic dimensions. We will also focus on the concept of #nodifier within the theory. L lntroduetl, on Uniiieation C~tcgo~q_al Grammm' (UCG) comlfines the syntactic insights of C~tegori~ll Grammar with the semantic insights of Discourse Rep,:escntafion Theory (DRT, Kamp 1981). The addition of unilicalion (Shiebcr et al. 1983) to these two flameworks allows a simple account of intcractiou between different linguistic levels. The xesulting, computationally efficient, system provkles an explicit tbmml fi'amework fbr linguistic description, within which large grammar ti'agnrents lbr French (Baschung et al. 1987) and F.nglish (Calder, Moens and Jmevat 1986) have already been developed. This paper will describe the design of the UCG formalism, illustrated by exarnples of grammatical categories and rules, l UCG embodies seve.d recent trends in linguistics. First, being a categorial grar,amar, it is strongly lexicalist, In other words relatively little Jr, formation is contained in grammar rules. Most information odginates in the lexicon. Second, it is strictly dechtrative. Unitication is the only operation allowed over grammatical objects;. Third, there is a very close relationship between the syntax and semantics of linguistic expressions. UCG lies with:ht the family of grammars described by Uszkoreit 1986 and Kmttunen 1986. tJCG also has close affinities to the IIead-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) proposed by Pollard 1985. The main theoretical difference is that in IIPSG welMi~rmedrmss is characterized algorithmically, rather than declm'atively as in OC(/. For this reason, we t,ave adopted l'ollard's tenn;nology and refer to linguistic expressions as signs. A sign retm>;ents a complex of phonological, syntactic and semantic tale.nation, each of these linguistic levels having its own definitions of well--formedness, In U(.'G, we employ three primitive categories: nomts (tmun), sentences (sent) md noun phrases (ltp) These primitive categories","i 'IIm work described here is SUl)portexl by the EEC ESPRIT projec P393 ACORD: the Cons|ruction and Interrogation of Knowledge Bases asia Natural L~mguag(~ Text and Graphics. admit further specification by features, so that we can distinguish tinite and non-finite sentences, nominative and accusative NPs, and so on. Categories are now defined as follows: (1) a.","Any primitive category (together with a syntactic feature","specification) is a category.","b.","If A is a category, and B is a sign, then A/B is a category. In a Category of the trmr A/B, we call B the active part of the category, and also of the sign as a whole in which A/B occurs as category. It will be observed that this definition is just tire categorial analog of Pollard's (1985) proposal for subcategoriza-tion, according to which phrasal heads ate spccificd for a list of signs corresponding to their complements. Likewise, (1) is closely related to the standard definition for the set of categories of a categorial grammar, Within the grammar, we allow not just constant sylnbols like sent and rip, but also variables, at each level of representatiou. V~wiables allow us to capture tire notion of inconlplete infomaa-tion, and a sign which contains variables can be further specitied by unilication. The form of unification that we rely on is first-order term unification, provided as a basic operation in programruing languages such as PROLOG. This, in essence, is the structure of UCG. We will complicate the picture by distinguishing two rules of fnnctional application, and by giving more content to the notions of semantics and features. 2. The Mechanisms of UCt; 2.1. Structuring Signs UCG signs have three basic components, corresponding to their\" phonology, category and semantics. We will write the most unspecified sign as follows: (2) w:","c:","s by which we intend a sign with phonology W, categow C and semantics S. (1) and (2) give well-formedness conditions on possible instantiations for a sign's category. For the present papm', we will assume that a sign's phonology may be simply its orthography in tire case of proper names, otherwise a sign's phonology may be composite, consistiug of variables and orthographic constants sep~ated by +. The + operator is understood as denoting concatenation. 2","2 This operation might apt)ear to take us beyond tile bounds of first-o~ler unification. However in the cases we will deal with, there are equivalent signs which express concatenation by means of PROI.OG difference lists. 83 2.2. Indexed Language The semantic representation language that we use to encode the semantics of a sign is called InL (for Indexed Language), and is derived from Discourse Representation Theory (cf. Kamp 1981), supplemented with a Davidsonian treatment of verb semantics (cf. Davidson 1967). The main similarity with the Discourse Representation languages lies in tile algebraic structure of InL. There are only two connectives for building complex formulas; an implication that at the same time introduces universal quantification, and a conjunction. The language InL differs in one important respect from the DRT formalism, and thus earns its name; every formula introduces a designated variable called its index. This does not mean that (sub)formulas may not introduce other variables, only that the index has a special status. The postulation of indices is crucial for the treatment of modifying expressions, but it is independently plausible on other grounds. Every sign has an associated ontological type, represented by the sort of its index. Subsump-tion relations hold between certain sorts; for instance, a index of sort singular will unify with an index of sort object to yield an index of sort singular. For notational purposes, we use lower case alphabetics to represent sorted variables in InL formulas. Upper case alphabetics are variables over formttlas. The index of an expression appears within square brackets in prenex position. (3) gives example translations of some expxessions. (3) [Index] Formula Expression Sort a. [el WALK(e, x) walk event b. Ix] STUDENT(x) student singular object c. [x] [PARK(y),[x] [IN(x,y),MAN(x)[I","man in a park singular object d. [m] BUTlER(m) butter mass object e. [s] STAY(s, x) stay state 3. UCG Binary Rules We may write UCG rules as simple relations between signs. We require two rules, our analogs of forwards and backwards application (FA and BA respectively). Here we follow the PROLOG convention that variables srart with an upper case alphabetic. (4) (FA) Phonology:Category/Active:Semantics Active Phonology:Category: Semantics","(BA) Active Phonology:Category/Active:Semantics","$","Phonology:Category: Semantics TheSe rules state that in the case of function application, the resulting category is simply that of the functor with its active sign removed; the semantics and phonology of the result are those of the functor, thus effecting a very strict kind of Head Feature Convention. Note in particular that we view the phonological, syntactic and semantic functor as always coinciding. This has important consequences for the way we treat quantified NP's, as we discuss in the next section. Any of the features of the resulting sign may have been further instantiated in the process of unification. Importantly, (4) states that a functor may place restrictions on any of the dimensions of its argument. Likewise it will determine the role that the information expressed by its argument plays in the resulting expression. A UCG sign thus represents a complex of constraints along several dimensions. 4. 1JCG Signs We now give some example UCG signs.","4.1. Nouns and Adjectives","(5) student:","noun:","[x]STUDENT(x) (6) cheerful+W:","noun/(W:noun: Ix]P):","[x] [CHEERFUL(x), [ix]P] The reader is invited to work out for herself how the signs (5) and (6) will combine using the rule of forwards application. 4.2. Determiners Following Montague 1973, we treat quantified NPs as type-raised terms. We can however take advantage of the polymorphic nature of UCG categories and have a single representation for NPs regardless of their syntactic context. In our analysis, the determiner introduces the type raising. This is the sign that corresponds to a. (7) W","(C/(W:C/a+Wl: np[nom or obj]:b):[a]S)/(Wl:noun:[b]R):","[a][[blR, S] More verbosely, this says that a combines first with a noun which has phonology W1 and semantic index b. The semantics that results from such a combination is a conjunction, the first conjunct of which is the semantics of the noun. The second conjunct is the semantics of the resulting NP's argument. As the NP is type-raised, it has a category of the schematic form: (8) C/(C/np) That is, a type-raised NP will take as its argument some constituent which was itself to combine with a (non-type-raised) NP. When fleshed out with values for the other components of a sign, it will have the form as shown in (9). Note in particular that, as it is the verb that determines linear order, the phonology of the resulting expression depends on that of the argument to the NP. (9) shows the result of combining (7) and (5) via forward application. (9) W","C/(W:C/a+student: rip[nora or obj]:b):[a]S:","[al[[blSTUDENT(b), Sl The sign corresponding to every (10) is very similar to that for a, the major difference being that every introduces DRT implication, notated here with ~.

(12) a+student+walks:","sent[fin]:","[e][[b]STUDENT(b), WALKS(e, b)] 5. Modifiers in UCG We have already seen one category of modifiers, namely adjectives, in section 4.1. We are able to make more general state-ments about modifiers; they all contain instances of the category in (13): (13) C/(W:C:S) 84 Appropriate msldctions on C wilt allow us to describe, for instance, the class of VP modifiers such as adverbials and auxiliaries (Cf. Bouma 1988). The close relationship between syntax and semantic,,; allow us to give concise formulations of the distinctions between intersective, vague and intensional modifiers (Kamp 1975). In the first two cases, the semantics of the modified expression is conjoined with that of the modifying expression. In the vague case, we have to relativize the meaning of the modifying expression to that of the modified. In the third case, the semantics of the modified expression must be contained within the scope of an intensional predicate. The following examples illustrate the three cases. (14) square+W:","noun/(W:noun:[a]A):","[allSQUARE(a), AI","large+W:","noun/(W:noun: [a]A):","[alILARGE(A, a), AI fake+W: nmm/(W:noun:[a]A): [alFAKE(A) 6. Further ltevelopment of the tlleory We have not attempted to give a fully representative list of UCG signs here. Elsewhere (Calder, Morns and Zeewtt 1986, Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987), substantial analyses of subcategorization, prepositional and adverbial modification, negation, relative clauses and sentential .connectives have been developed. We have also extended the theory to encompass non-canonical word order, using ;t mechanism similm\" to the GPSG SLASH (Gazdar et al. 1985), and to handle quantificational constraints on anaphora following the analysis of Johnson and Klein 1986. We have an eftie:ient implementation of the system which represents signs as PROIOG terms, using a different treatment of phonological informalion. The use of templates (Shieber et al. 1983) allows us to capture generaliztions about clases of lexical items. The compilalion of UCG structures into PROLOG temas is petformed by a general processor driven by the definitions of well-formedness of the dimensions of a sign, allowing compile-time typeocbecking of grammars (Calder, Moens and Zeevat 1986). The system u:;es a tabular shift-reduce parser. 7. Further 6evelopments of UCG The system described above is deficient in some respects. For example, requiring coincidence between the phonological, syntactic and semantic funetors may be too strict. The problem of quantifier scoping is a case in point. Zeevat 1987 suggests relaxing this requirement to allow linear ordering to become the dominant factor in determining semantic functor-argument relations. It seems likely that such a step will also be necessary for certain phonological phenomena. Current work is investigating the utility of associative and commutative unification in this respect. in extending UCG to allow u'eammnt of unbounded dependency constructions and partially fi'ee word order, heavy use is made of uttary rules (Wittenburg 1986). Current work aims to recast the notion of unary rule within the framework of paramodular unification (Siekmann 1984). 8. Conclusion An attractive feature of UCG is the manner in which different levels of representation - semantic, syntactic and phonological - are built up simultaneously, by the mfiform device of unification. There axe, of course, different organizing principles at the different levels; conjunction and implication exist at the semantic level, but not at the syntactic or phonological. Nevertheless, the composit:,onal construction of all three levels takes place in the same manner, namely by the accretion of constraints on possible representations. Although we have said nothing substantive about phonology here, it seems plausible, in the light of Bach and Wheeler 1981 and Wheeler 1981, that the methodological principles of compositiouality, monotonicity and locality can also lead to illuminating analyses in the domain of sound stnmture. UCG is distinctive in the particular theory of semantic representation which it espouses. Two iilcidental features of InL may obscure its relation to DRT. The first is very minor: our formulas are linear, rather than consisting of \"box-ese\". The second difference is that we appear to make no distinction between the set of conditions in it DRS, and the set of discourse markers. In fact, this is not the case. A simple recursive definition (similar to that for \"free wtriable\" in predicate logic) suffices to construct the cunmlative set of discourse markers associated with a complex condition from indices within a formula. This definition also allows us to capture the constraints on anaphora proposed by DRT. These departures from the standard DRT formalism do not adversely affect the insights of Kamp's theory, but do offer a substantial advantage in allowing a rule-by-rule construction of the representations, something which has evaded most other analyses in the literature. UCG syntax is heavily polymorphic in the sense that the category identity of a fim~tion application typically depends on the make-up of the argmnent. Thus, the result of applying a type-raised NP to a transitive verb phrase is an intransitive verb phrase, while exactly the same functor applied to an intransitive verb phrase will yield a sentence. Analogously, a prepositional moditier applied to a scntence will yield a sentence, while exactly the same functor applied to a noun will yield a noun. This approach allows us to dramatically simplify the set of categories employed by the grammar, while also retaining the fundamental insight of standard categorial grammar, namely that expressions combine as fnnctor and argument. Such a mode of combination treats head-complement relations and hcad-moditier relations as special cases, and provides an elegant typology of categories that can only be awkwardly mimicked in X-bar syntax. Finally, we note one important innovation. Standard ctttegorial grammar postulates a functor-argument pair in semantic rcpresenration which parallels the syntactic constituents; typically, lambda-abstraction is required to construct the appropriate flmctor expressions in semantics. By contrast, the introduction of signs to the right of the categorial slash means that we subsume semantic combinatioi* within a generalized fnnctional application, and the necessity ~{) consmtcting specialized flmctors in the semantics simply disaopears.
