The implementation is designed to handle typical prosodic input in the form of parallel input channels, and processes each input channel independently in a data-directed, phonologically motivated configuration of partly parallel, partly cascaded feature modules and module clusters, each implemented as finite transducers, producing intonationally relevant categories as output. The design criteria included maximal restriction of computational power (the system could be compiled into one massive finite transducer); relevance to computational linguistic formalisms with a view to developing an integrated model mapping prosodic structures on to textual structures; relatability to speech recognition algorithms, and to phonological theories. It was implemented in an object oriented environment with parallel processing simulation (CheOPS), and a linguistically interesting surface language (BATLAN). 1. Aims and design criteria","In this paper a new architecture for the parallel processing of feature systems, particularly in phonology, is presented and applied to data-directed prosodic parsing in English. It uses independent feature processing modules in configurations which allow Parallell, Sequential, Incremental (PSI) or Parallel, Hierarchical, Incremental (PHI) processing of phonetic data by the modules, with linguistically relevant output (in this case, prosodic categories such as pitch accent).","The domain of prosodic features (especially intonation, stress or accent, tone) has not yet received significant attention from computational linguists. It poses problems which are rather different from the phoneme or letter concatenation models typically used in computational models of written language. In particular, the problems concern the parallel processing of segmental and suprasegmental features in functionally and structurally partly autonomous tiers; an architecture for this purpose has to be able to cope with a variety of different synchronisation protocols for feature modules and module clusters. In addition, a prosodic parser has to translate from a detailed phonetic feature representation into a more abstract prosodic structure suitable for mapping on to lexical items in syntactic, semantic and pragmatic contexts.","Several styles of computational architecture could be used for this purpose, from relatively ad hoc blackboard architectures to the kind of virtual, abstract parallelism tbr feature processing in unification granmaars. The selec'~ion criteria used here included:","1 Maximal restriction of computational power in terms of time and space bounds.","2 Conceptual compatibility with computational linguistic formalisms used at other linguistic levels, with a view to developing an integrated model.","3 As far as possible, relatability to speech recognition algorithms.","4 Suitability as a simulator for phonological theories of the autosegmental type.","It would appear at first sight to be a nearly impossible task to fulfil all these criteria at once. However, study of each of these areas revealed that a concept using finite automata (in particular, finite transducers) to simulate the feature modules, and partly parallel, partly cascaded configurations of these to simulate feature clusters and autosegmental tiers comes close to satisfying them, including the speech recognition requirement (cf. the hidden Markov models, Levinson 1986).","A secondary aim was to develop a versatile workbench for such descriptions. A linguistically interesting and useful surface language for transition networks (BATLAN, Eikmeyer/Gibbon 1983)was selected for formulating the feature modules, and provided with control mechanisms for parallel and (unidirectionally) cascaded modules, clusters and tiers with different modes of synchronisation and interaction. The implementation was developed in an object oriented programming environment with facilities for the simulation of parallel processing (CheOPS, Eikmeyer 1986). 2. The PSI/PHI architecture and prosodic pa~ing","The PSI/PHI concept is suitable for application to other linguistic domains which can be modelled with parallel feature processing. A pure PSI system (using finite automata in feature modules) is weakly equivalent to massive single finite automaton, though obviously with greater expressive power, while a pure PHI system (using push-down automata in feature modules) could be used to process languages up to and including context sensitive indexed languages. The prosodic parsing application is a pure PSI system. The PHI facility is 202 not used at pre~nt; neither is a set of augmentations designed to provide ATN-Iikc facilities if require~l. The feature modnlc m~tomata are lbrmulatezt as finite transition networks.","hi the prosodic parsing application, rite PSI system has a two4evel cascade structure, each consisting of parallel tiers of ~baturt:s trod tbature clusters° The configuration used at present in a \"stress: parser *~ lbr German is showu in Figure 1.","InPut to the parser consists of parallel chmmels of' digitisexl signal paracneters such as intensity or fundamental ti'equeney (other spettral parameters could also be used). The initial 'hmture detector (FI.)) level plays a specific fimctional role; it has the task of simulating the classical five tasks of a feature detector: parameter identification, time window specification, smootifing ?unction, segmentatiou algorithm~ aud classification (value ~,migmnent) algorithm. Fairly simple feature models for acoustic edge-detection (zero crossing, slope maxima) and contour detection (peak etc.) are fbHnulated as transition network tr~atsducers. Since the input signal is a continuous stream of' ;ndefinite length, the transducers are not assigned special finite, states, but can in; stoppexl anywhere.

At tile top is a representation of two digitised sigaal parameters. The first group of \"feature tapes\" shows the output of the FD level, with upward, downward and central spikes representing binary o1' tertiary valucxt features, and dots representing null output. Tile second gl'oup shows the output of tile FC level, with considerably more sparse representation of data-driven abstraction hypotheses about possible occurrences of prosodic categories. The other two levels show outputs within tile textual mapping component. 203","Close attention has been paid to the empirical basis of this application. Results of experimental phonetic studies were used in formulating the FDs, and accent perception tests were conducted in order to verify the output of the PSI system against native listeners (Braun & Jin 1987). The tests yielded a satisfyingly high rate of approx. 85%. Within a homogeneous dialect group the parser is speaker-independent; the data are \"raw\" instructions for constructing blocks worlds, and include hesitations and repairs.","The application is being developed within a project group financed by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to include further prosodic categories and a suitable syntax with strategies for coping with special speech processes such as slips and repairs. The pragmatic-semantic level of therue-rheme and focus structures has already been defined for restricted blocks worlds dialogues (Pignataro 1987) and will be incorporated into an automatic focus assignment system.","Other, sta'ucturally different, or less expressive, or more heterogeneous systems using finite devices (particularly in phonology and phonetics), are being studied with a view to extending areas of application of the PSI/PHI architecture (cf. fHart & Collier 1975, Pierrehumbert 1980 in intonation; Church 1980, 1983 in syntax and segmental phonology.; Kay & Kaplan 1981, Kay 1987 in phonology and morphology; Bolc & Maksymienk0 1981, Chomyszyn 1986 in a Polish text-to-speech interface with rules by Steffen-Batogowa; Koskenniemi 1983 in morphology; Gibbon 1981, 1987 in intonation and tonology; Berwiek & Pilato 1987 in syntax acquisition).
