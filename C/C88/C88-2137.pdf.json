It is contrasted with traditional models of parsing in which syntactic and semantic representations itre built as the result of parsing and are normally lost after each parse. In the DMA model, input sentences are identified with the memory sU'ucture which represents the input, and are in-stantiatcd to represent flint specific input. Since understanding is performed as recognition through the memoly network, the result of understanding is ~aot lost after each sentence is processed. Also, since parsing and memory-based inferences are integrated, ~arious memory~based activities emt be triggered directly through natural language understanding without separate inferential processes.","As on~' application of DMA, at the Center for Machine \"l?anslatioil (CMT) at Carnegie Mellon University, we have developed a natucal language interface for our large-scale knowledge-based machine translation system t called DM- (~OMMAND.

This system has been demonstrated to be highly effective as a MT developmental support system, since researchers who develop these individual knowledge sources are otherwise unknowledgeable about the internal implementation of the MT system. The DMA natural language interface can provide access (currently English and Japanese) to the system's internal functions through natural language command and query inputs. This use of the DMA model for natural language iw terfaces demonstrates that it is an effective alternative to other natural language interface schemes."]},{"title":"II. A background of DMA","paragraphs":["The Direct Memoly Access method of parsing originated in Quillian~s[1968] notion of semantic memory, which was nsed in his TLC (Quillian[1969]) which led to further research in semantic network-based processing 2. TLC used breadth-first spreading marker-passing as an intersection search of two lexically pointed nodes in a semantic memory, leaving interpretation of text as an intersection of the paths. Thus, interpretation of input text was directly performed on semantic memory. Although TLC was the first DMA system, DMA had not been explored as a model of parsing until the DMAP0 system of Riesbeek&Martin, except as a scheme for disambiguations. I)MAP0 used a guided marker-passing algorithm to avoid the problem of an explosion of search paths, from which a dumb 3 (not guided) marker passing mechanism inherently suffers. DMAP0 used P~markers (Prediction markers) and A-markers (Activation markers) as markers passed around in memory, adopting the notion of concept sequence to represent linear ordering of concepts as linguistic knowledge, which guides linear predictions of concepts sending P-markers in memory.","ZSueh as Fahhnan[1979], Hirst&Charniak[1982].

Likewise, the direct memory access recognition of a question means that the concept which is identified by the input is directly connected to the concept that represents the answer, as long as the system knows (or potentially knows) the answer. In oilier words, in the DMA model, recognition of a request for action is a triggering of the action requested and recognition of a question is knowing the answer (i.e., as soon as we understand the question, either we know the answer, or we know the inferences to be performed (or functions to be evaluated) to get the answer) as long as memory contains the action and the answer. 'lb reiterate the literature on the DMA paradigm, in this model, memory is organized in the hierarchical network of concepts which are related by links that define the concepts. Thus, as soon as we identify the input with a certain concept in the memory, we can trigger the action (if this is a concept that represents some action (or request for action)), or answer the question (if the concept represents some knowledge (or request for some knowledge)). Thus, parsing and inference are integrated in the memory search process, and no separate inferential modules are necessary. It should be understood; however, that it is not our claim that we can eliminate inference altogether. Our claim is that 1) the memory search through concept refinement itself is an inference which is normally performed by separate inference modules- (such as eontexual inference and discourse analyses modules) in other parsing paradigm; and 2) whenever further inference is necessary, such inference can be directly triggered after concept refinement from the result of parse (for example, as a daemon stored in the abstraction of the refined concept) and therefore, the inference is integrated in the memory activity."]},{"title":"C. Ellispsis","paragraphs":["and anaphora In a practical natural language interface, the capacity to handle elliptic and anaphorie expressions is important. DM-COMMAND is capable of handling these phenomena, because under the DMA paradigm (which is typically called \"recognize-and-record paradigm\"), the result of each parse is not lost after each sentence, but instead remains as part of the contexual knowledge in the memory network. On the other hand, in the traditional parsing paradigm (we call it \"build-and~store\" paradigm), since the result of the parse is lost after each sentence, the parsers can at best handle indexicality within a sentence.

Therefore, a DMA system needs deliberate preparation of concept sequences to handle syntactically complex sentences (such as deeply embedded clauses~ small cauls, many types of sentential adjuncts, etc.). This does not mean that it is incapable of handling syntactically complex sentences, instead it means that concept sequences at some level of abstraction (at syntactic template level down to phrasal lexicon (Becker[1975]) level) must be prepared for each type of complex sentence. In other words, although such sentences can be handled by the combination of concept sequences, designing such sequences can be complex and less general than using external syntactic knowledge 17. Thus, current reliance upon a linear sequence of concepts causes limitations on the types of sentences that can be realistically handled in DM-COMMAND. Of course, there is nothing to prevent DMA paradigm to integrate syntactic knowledge othea' than a linear sequence of concepts. Actually, we have already implemented two alternative schemes for integrating phrasestructure rules into DMA. One method we used was having syntactic nodes as part of the memory and writing phrasestructure rules as concept sequences 18. Another method was to integrate the DMA memory activity into an augnrnented context-free grammar unification in a generalized LR parsing. Second method used in a continuous speech understanding is described in Tomabeetti&Tomita[ms]. We will not discuss these schemes in this paper.","While handling syntactically complex sentences is rather expensive for DM-COMMAND, since it relies solely on linear concept sequences, natural language interfaces are one appli-tiffs can be supplied since the memory activity after the first sentence is ~ot lost and the memory can supply the missing object.","15Fur example in \"Pretty-print dm.lisp.

It seems that DMA is one ideal paradigm in this axeao This is evident if we consider the fact that input to a natui'al language interface is normally in a form of dialog and users tend to input short, elliptic, ambiguous aud even ungrammatical sentences to the interface. Our experience shows that an increase in the size and complexity of the system ~n order to integrate full syntaciic processing, enhancing the DMA's capacity to handle syntactically complex sentences, has so far outweighed the need for such capacity 19.

One is the semantic network that is developed under the MT system as domain knowledge that DM-COMMAND utilizes. The other as the network of memoxy which is unique to DM-COMMAND.

This memory network is written with generic concepts for development of MT systems, so that this memory we have developed at CMT should be portable to other systems 2°.","The control mechanism (i.e., spreading activation guided marker-passing algorithm) and the actual functions for performing actions are separate (actu',d functions ale integrated iuto the ]D~/~-COMMAND memory network). This separation makes the system highly portable, first because virtually no change is necessary in the control mecharfism for iranspolting to other systems, and second because the size of the whole system can be trimmed or expanded according to the machine's aw61able virtual memory space simply by changing the size of the DM-COMMAND memory network 21.","Thus, ~mder DMA, a natural language interface can 1) directly spr,~ad markers on the target system's already existing semautic network 22, utilizing the existing knowledge","19Although, we have seen that it is effective in parsing noisy continuous sl)eech input (Tomabechi&Tomita[ms]). ~Of conrse~ we will need to change the specific functions that are stored in some of the nodes and perhaps some of the specific (lower in the hierarchy) concepls need to be modified for each specific system. 21if only a l)asic command natural language interface is required, then we can trim |h,~ pints of memory used for adwmced interface and question-answering.

Also, note thai due to the spreading activation guided mal'ker..passing algorifllm of the DM-CoMMAND recognizer, the speed of the system is ndnimally affected by an increase in the size of the memory for commanding and qnestion-mlswering.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["DM-.COMMAND is the first practical application of the DMA paradigm of natural language understanding, in which parsing and memory-based inference is integrated. This system has been proven to be highly effective in knowledge-based MT development. It is due to the complexity of system implementations in a large scale MT project that grammar and knowledge base writers axe not expected to have expertise ou the internals of the translation system, whereas it is necessary for such a group of project members to access the system internal functions. DM-COMMAND makes this access possible through a natural language command and question answering interface. Since DM-COMMAND uses the spreading activation guided marker-passing algorithm, in a memory access parser which directly accesses the MT system's already exist~ ing network of concepts, inference is integrated into memory activity. Since there is a separate memory network for concepts representing commanding and question-answering that are generic to MT system development, the system is highly portable. The DM-COMMAND system demonstrates the power of a direct memory access paradigm as a model for a natural language interface, since understanding in this model is a l'ecognition of the input sentence with the existing knowledge in memory, and as soon as such understanding is done, the desired command can be directly triggered (or the question directly answered).","With DMA's ability to handle extra-sentential phenomena (including ellipsis, anaphora, pronoun reference, and wordsense ambiguity), which are typical in a practical natural language commaud/query inputs, DMA is one ideal paradigm for natural language interfaces as shown in our DM-COMMAND system. Also, DMA's integration of parsing and inference into an unified semantic memory search has proven to be highly effective in this application."]},{"title":"Appendix: Implementation","paragraphs":["ql~e DM-COMMAND system has been implemented on the IBM-RT ~3 and HP9000 AI workstations, both running","23Due to the space limitation, the actual sample output of the system is not included in this proceedings paper.
