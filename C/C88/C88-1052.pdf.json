These unrealistic assumptions can be eliminated if each presupposition is treated as the belief of an agent. However, it ~s not enough to consider only the beliefs of the speaker; we show that the beliefs of other agents are often involved. We describe a new model, including an improved definition of presupposition, that treats presuppositions as beliefs and considers the beliefs of all agents involved in the discourse. We show that treating presuppositions as beliefs makes it possible to explain phenomena that cannot be cxplainecl otherwise."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In addition 'I;o its literM meaning, a sentence or utterance conveys a host of indirect information that can be pragmatically in~rred. Presuppositions, whidl we mark \">>\", are one pa~'t of that information. Table 1 gives several examples of presupposition with their traditional analyses 1.","Roughly, a presupposition is a proposition that is conveyed by a sentence or utterance 2 but is not part of the main point, and must be consistent with the established context in order for that sentence or utterance to be felicitous. For example, the following is infelicitous because the second .,~entence presupposes that Angle quit, which contradicts the first sentence: (1) *Angle didn't quit. It's surprising that she quit. Other types of pragmatic inference include entailment, conversational implicature, and conventional implicature (see Levinson (1983) for detailed descriptions). Presuppositions can be distinguistmd from other sorts of pragmatic inference by their unique behavior when the sentence from which they originate is negated. These basic ideas are generally agreed upon; however, their formalization into a theory of presupposition has been difficult. We will now introduce two problems and our approach to solving them.","1 Throughout this paper, we use the sentence itself a.q short form for its semantic representation, in order to avoid addressing the orthogonal issu*., of semantic representation.","2The sentence/utterance distinction will be made clear in the presentation of ouc approach.","Horton (1987) reviews several theories, including those of Karttunen (1973, 1974), Karttunen and Peters (1979), Wcischedcl (1975, 1979), Gazdar (1979a, 1979b), Wilson and Sperber (1979), and Atlas and Levinson (1981). One problem is that many theories of presupposition iiaplicitly make the' following unrealistic assumptions s:","• Truth Assumption: If sentence S (or its utterance) presupposes proposition P, then P is true.","• Shared Belief Assumption: If sentence S (or its utterance) presupposes proposition P, then all agents involved share the prior belief that P is true. Weischedel and Gazdar are exceptions; e~tch of them at-tributes presuppositions to the speaker as either knowl-. edge or belief. However, we will show th~tt the beliefs of agents other than the speaker must be considered in order to correctly express many presuppositions. Our ai)proach is to treat presuppositions as beliefs, but a.lso to consider the beliefs of all agents involved in discourse.","A second difl~culty has been in finding an adequate definition of presupposition. Many definitions state that the presuppositions of a sentence must be known prior to the utterance of that sentence to avoid infelicity. Some have the stronger constraint that the presuppositions must be mutually known by all participants. The following definition (Levinson 1983, 205) has these properties:","DEFINITION 1: An utterance A pragmatically presupposes a proposition B iff A is appropriate only if B is mutually known by participants. These requirements, which reflect the Shared Belief Assumption, are too strict -- presuppositions are often used to introduce new information. Conversely, many definitions accept inferences from the other inference classes as presuppositions. Our definition, to be presented in section 3.2, weakens the overly strict prior knowledge condition so that it does not reject valid presuppositions, and avoids accepting inferences from other classes by checking whether each candidate exhibits the distinctive behavior under negation that signifies a presupposition. Hence, the new definition captures presupposition more precisely.","The next section describes the unique behavior of presuppositions under negation. In section 3 the details of our","3Here both sentences and utterances are mentioned because the assumptions are generally made when either is analyzed. 255"]},{"title":"II' ..... ~!gger","paragraphs":["Faetive verb It:cleft Change-of-state verb Non-restrictive relative clause Implicative verb Definite description Verb of judging","Example Rita is upset that Jenny lied. >>Jenny lied.

By this view, the presupposition in example 3 remains constant under the negation in the first sentence, but is later defeated by the second sentence.","(2) Calvin {did I didn't} stop going to college. >>Calvin had been going to college.","(3) I don't wish I had a Porsehe -- I already have one. ~I don't have a Porsche. Our explanation of this behavior is different. Before presenting it, some terminology must be introduced.","We will make the following semantic distinction between two kinds of negation. Internal negation has a particular element of its scope as its focus, in the sense of the terms defined by Quirk and Greenbaum (1973, 187-188). External negation focuses on an unspecified component of its scope and therefore has several possible interpretations. The following sentence contains external negation. It has at least three interpretations:","(4) The boogieman didn't blow the door shut. (a) It's stiff open.","[ negating the main proposition ] (b) There is no boogieman.","[ negating a presupposition ] (c) It was already shut.","[ negating a felicity condition ] The focus of internal negation is unambiguous. If that","focus is on a presupposition, the presupposition, of course,","does not survive the negation, as in the following:","(5) Mark, who has a Ph.D., is the president. >>Mark has a Ph.D.","(6) Mark, who doesn't have a Ph.D., is the president. ~Mark has a Ph.D. Internal negation that focuses on anything other than a presupposition does not affect that presupposition, because presuppositions do not depend on tile truth of any other thing expressed by the sentence. For example, the presupposition of sentence 7 still holds when the main proposition is negated.","(7) Debbie, who has a dog, {does I doesn't} have cats. >>Debbie has a dog.","External negation is inherently vague. We argue that it is handled as follows. One first checks to see if there is any evidence favoring one of the possible interpretations. If a presupposition contradicts any established information, one assumes the intended reading negates that presupposition; hence the presupposition is never believed to hold. We will call this the blocking of a presupposition. In the absence of any evidence to guide one in choosing an interpretation, one assumes that negation of the main proposition was intended, and hence that the presupposition stands. This assumption might be either supported or refuted by information to follow. If it is refuted, then the incorrect presupposition must be retracted.","Our analysis of example 3 then, is as follows. The negation in the first sentence is ambiguous and, on hearing that sentence alone, the hearer assumes a reading where the focus of negation is on wish and the presupposition is left intact. That is, the hearer assumes the intended reading was I don'~ have a Porsehe, and I don't want one. On hearing the second sentence, the hearer learns that this assumption was incorrect, and the presupposition that I don'~ have a Porsche is retracted.","In summary, a presupposition survives semantically internal negation exactly when the negation does not focus on the presupposition itself. It is assumed to survive semantically external negation unless there is evidence to the contrary, in which case it is blocked. If not blocked, it 256 may be retracted later if the assumption is shown to be incorrect by evidence that follows. We use the term defeat to subsmne both blocking and retraction. Horton (1987, sec. 1.2) shows that this behavior distinguishes presuppositions from entaihnents and implicatures."]},{"title":"3 Presuppositions as Beliefs","paragraphs":["The at)proach proposed here is to treat each presupposition as the belief of some particular agent in order to avoid ~he assumptions of truth and shared belief and thereby arts.in a more reatistie account of presupposition. In addition, we propose considering all agents when deciding to whom tim belief should be attributed.","Before continuing, we will point out our assumptions. Following Griee (1975), we assmne tlrst that no speaker will deliberately try to deceive the listener, and second that no speaker will use irony or sarcasm. Deceit, irony, and sarca,;m cart affect presuppositions, and the possibility of handling them is discussed by tIorton (1987)."]},{"title":"3.1 A Logic for Modeling Context","paragraphs":["In (Hortoi, 1987) a formal logic of belief is defined.

Its semantics is based on belief structures, a w~riant of Fagin, Halpern, and Vardi's knowledge structures (1984). A belief structure encodes what Will be called a state -- the truth wdue of each proposition, as well as the beliefs of each agent regarding these propositions, their beliefs about the other agents' beliefs, and so on. If a proposition P is true for a belief structures, wewrites ~P;ifnot, wewrites ~P. We also infornmlly describe operations Add Proposition, which updates a belief structure to encode a new belief for some agent, and Retract Proposition, which retracts a proposition from an agent's beliefs. These operations can bc used to model the acquisition and retraction of presuppositiomfl information by agents. Formal definitions of these operations raise difficult problems that wc have not solved. See (Horton 1987, 37--42). However, the logic does provide a notation a,ll,:l formal semantics for the expression of beliefs."]},{"title":"3.2 The Definition of Presupposition","paragraphs":["We now present a definition of presupposition that embodies the idea of attributing presuppositions to specific agents, and incorporates our view of the behavior of presupposltion.,~ under negation.","The presuppositions of an utterance depend not only on the sentence uttered, but also on the speaker, the listener, and the listener's beliefs, since only the listener's beliefs affect the cancdlation of presuppositions for him. One sometimes wishes to speak of presuppositions when not all of this contextual information is known. In particular, it is desirable to be able to discuss presuppositions of a sentence independent of any context of utterance. In such cases, it is not possible to perform a consistency check to determine whether or not a candidate will actually turn out to be a presupposition; but one can say that if the necessary information were available and if the proposition were consistent with established information, then the proposition would be a presupposition. We will define potential presupposition to capture this notion of a candidate presupposition that may turn out to hold when the sentence is completely situated, and actual presupposition to denote a potential presupposition that does turn out to hold 4.","In the definitions below, S ~ is used to rel)resent tile affirmative form of sentence S, and S- to represent the externally negated form of the sentence. We will use the term state to refer to a state of affairs, as represented by a belief structure."]},{"title":"Potential Presupposition","paragraphs":["The definition of potential presupl)osition for when only the sentence is known is as follows:","DEHNI'rlON 2: Sentence S potentially presui)poses t)roposition P iff for any speaker Sp, listener L, and state a,","(a) The utterance of S + by Sp to L in state s would allow L to infer Bs'vP.","(b) The utterance of S- by Sp to L in state s would allow L to infer BspP unless L already believed Bsp~P, i.e., unless s ~ BLBsp'-P.

Clause (b) says that even if the negative ibrm of the sentence were spoken, any listener could still infer that the speaker believed P, unlc'ss the listener already believed otherwise. A definition with clause (a) alone woukl capture other pragmatic inferences as well as presupposition. Since clause (b) requires that the candidate exhibit the behavior under negation that is unique to presupposition, it excludes the others.

Second, Gazdar computes his \"pre-suppositions\" using a set of unconnected and unmotivated rules, whereas our definition of potential presupposition lends coherence to the diverse class of potential presuppositions. The key difference between the present work and Gazdar's is that our emphasis is not on the behavior of presuppositions in context, but on the relevance of agents' beliefs to all aspects of presupposition.
