MAXWELL Ill Xerox Pale Alto Research Center","aaaa Coyote Hill Road Pale Alto, California 94304 USA Ahstract: This paper outlines a theory of constituent coordination For l,exicaI-Funetional Grammar. On this theory LFG's flat, unstructured nets are used as the functional representation of coordinate constructions, l\"unction application is extended to sets by treating a set tbrmally am the generalization of its Functional clmnents. This causes properties attributed externally to a coordinate structure to be uniformly distributed across its elements, without requiring additional grammatical specifications. lntroduetio,~ A proper treammnt of coordination has long been an elusive goal of both tlmoretical and computational apln'oaches to language. The original transformational formulation in terms of the Coordinate Reduction rule (e.g./1)ougherty 1970/) was quickly shown to have many theoretical and empirical inadequacies, and only recently have linguistic theories (e.g GPSG/Gazdar ct al. 1985/, Catcgorial granmmr (e.g./Steedman 1985/) made substantial progress on eharactm'izing the complex restrictions on coordinate constructions and also on their smnantic intertn'etations. Coordination has also presented descriptive problems for emnputational approaches. Typically these have been solved by special devices that are added to the parsing algorithms to analyze coordinate constructions that cannot easily be characterized in explicit rules of grmnmar. The best known examples of this kind of approach are SYSCONJ /Woods 1973/, LSP/Sager 1981/, and MSG/l)ahl and McCord 19831. Coordination phenomena are usually divided into two classes, tbe so-called constituent coordinations where the coordinated elements hmk like otherwise well-motivated phrasal constituents 111. and noneonstituent coordinatiofi where the coordinated elements look like fragments of pl)rasal constituents (2). (1) (a) A girl saw Mary and ran to Bill. (Com'dinated verb phrases)","(b) A girl saw and heard Mary. (Com'dinated verbs} (2) Bill wenL to Chicago on Wednesday and New York on Thursday. Of course, what is or is not a well-motivated constituent depends on the details of the particular grammatical theory Constituents in transformationally-oriented theories, For example, are units that simplify the feeding relations of transformational rules, whereas \"constituents\" in eategorial grammars merely reflect the order of binary combination.~; and have no other special motivation. In lexical-functional grammar, sm'faee constituents are taken to be the units of t)honological interpretation. These nmy differ markedly frmn the units of functional or semantic interpretation, as shown in the analysis of Dutch cross serial dependencies given by/Bresnan et al. 1982/. Noneonstituent coordination, of course, presents a wide variety of complex and difficult descriptive problems, but constituent coordination also raises important linguistic issues. It is the latter that we focus on in this brief paper. To a first ai)proximation, constituent coordinations can be analyzed as the result of taking two independent clauses and factoring out their comnmn subl)arts. The verb coordination in (lb) is thus related to the Fuller sentence coordination in (3). This intuition, which was the basis of the Coordinate Reduction Transformation, accounts for more emnplex patterns of acceptability such am (4) illustrates. The coordination in/4e) is acceptable because both (4a) and (4b) are, while (4e) is bad because of the independent subeategorization violation in (4d) (3) A girl saw Mary and a girl heard Mary. (4) (a) A girl dedicated a pie to Bill.","(b) A girl gave a pie to Bill.","(c) A girl dedicated and gave a pie to Bill.","(d) *A gM ate a pie to Bill.","(e) *A girl dedicated and ate a pie to Bill. This first approximation is frought with difficulties. It ensures that constituents of like categories can be conjoined only if they share some finer details of specification, but there are more subtle conditions that it does not cover. For example, even though (5a) and (5b) are both independently grammatical, the coordination in (5c) is unacceptable: (5) (a) The girl promised John to go.","(b) The gM persuaded John to go.","(c) *The girl promised and persuaded John to go.","IHint: Who isg'oing 9) Another welbknown difficulty with this approach is that it does not obviously allow for the necessary semantic distinctions to be made, on the assumption that the semantic properties of reduced coordinations are to be explicated in terms of the semantic representations of the propositional coordinations that they are related to. This is illustrated by the contrasting semantic entailments in (6): Sentence (6a) allows for the possibility that two different girls are involved while (6b) implies that a single (but indefinite) girl performed both actions. (6) (a) A girl saw Mary and a girl talked to Bill.","(b) A girl saw Mary and talked to Bill. l)espite its deficiencies, it has not been easy to find a satisfactory alternative to this first approximation. The theoretical challenge is to embed coordimttion in a grammatical system in a way that is independent of the other generalizations that are being expressed leg aetives correspond to passives, NP's in English can be (bliowed by relative clauses, English relative clauses look like S's with a missing NP) hut which interacts with those specifications in just the right ways. That is, a possible but unacceptable solution to this descriptive dilemma would be to add to the grammar new versions of all the basic rules designed specifically to account tbr the vagaries ofcoor(tination. Coordination was not discussed in the original tbrmulation of {,exicaM\"nnctional Grammar /Kaplan & lh'esnan 1982/, although mathematical objects (finite sets of f-structures) were introduced to provide an underlying representation for grammatical constructions which, like the parts of a coordination, do not seem to obey the uniqueness conditiml that normally applies to grammatical functions and features. Adjuncts and other modifying constructions are the m~,ior o~tample of this that Kapleln and Brcsnan discussed, but they also suggested that the same nmthenmtical representations might also be used in the analysis of coordinatim~ l)henomena. In the present paper we extend the I,FG formalism to provide a simple account of coordination that Follows along the general lines of the Kaplan/Bresnan suggestion and does not involve detailed specifications of the coordination properties of particular constituents. We illustrate the consequences of this extension by discussing a small mnnber of grammatical constructions; Bresnan, Kaplan, end Peterson (forthcoming) discuss a much wider range of phenomena and provide more general linguistic motivation tbr this approach. Simple Coordination A lexical-functional grammar assigns two syntactic levels of representation to each grammatical string in a language. The constituent structure, or c-structure, is a convemtiona[ lree thaL indicates tbc organization of surface wm'ds and phrases, while the fimctienal structure (gstrueturc) is a hierarchy nfattributes and values that represents the grammatical functions and features of the sentence. MeG assumes as a basic aximn that there is a piecewise function, called a structural correspondence or \"pro.iection\" , that maps from the nodes in the e-structure to the units in an abstract f-structure (see/Kaplan & Bresnan i982/ and /Kaplan 1987/ lbr details). This means that the properties of the f-structure can be specified in terms of the mother-daughter and precedence relations in the c-structure, even though the f-structure is formally not at all a tree-like structure. Now let us consider a simple example of coordination wherein two sentences are conjoined together (7). A plausible c-structure for this sentence is given in (8), and we propose (9) to represent the fnnctional properties of this sentence. (7) John bought apples and John ate apples.

(We use brackets with a line at the center to denote set objects.) As Bresnan, Kaplan, and Peterson (forthcoming) observe, sets constitute a plausible formal representation for coordination since an unlimited number of items can be conjoined in a single construction and none of those items dmninates or has scope over the others. Neither particular functional attributes nor recursive embeddings of attributes can provide the appropriate representation that fiat, unstructured sets allow• To obtain the representation &coordination shown in (8) and (9), all we need is the following alternative way of expanding S: (10) S ~ S"]},{"title":"CONJ","paragraphs":["S This rule says that a conjoined sentence consists of a sentence followed by a conjunction followed by another sentence, where the 5structures of each sub sentence is an element of the f-structure that represents their coordination. Coordination with Distribution The next step is to consider constituent coordinations where some parts of the sentence are shared by the coordinated constituents. Consider the following sentence: ( 11 ) John bought and ate apples• (12) (13)","s NP VP N V NP John V CONJ V N"]},{"title":"I I I l","paragraphs":["bought and ate apples PRED 'BUY<[JOHN],[APPLE]>~I TENSE PAST"]},{"title":"\" ]] pREO 'APP,.Eq II pREB 'JONNq \\11 ~REO 'EAT<[JOHNI,FPP~ I TENSE ~ l] ]BJ 5UBJ","paragraphs":["The desired c-structure and f-structure for (11) are shown in (12) and (13) respectively• Notice that the subjects and objects of BUY and EAT are linked, so that the f-structure is different from the one in (9) for John bought apples and John ate apples. The identity links in this structure account for the different semantic entaihnents of sentences (7) and (11) as well as ['or the differences in (da)\" and (db). '['his is an example of verb coordination, so the following alternative is added to the grammar: (14) V -) V CONJ V This rule permits the appropriate c-structure configuration but its functional specifications are no different than the ones for simple sententia[ coordination. [low then do the links in (13) arise? The basic descriptive device of the LFG formalism is the function application expression: (15) (fa) ="]},{"title":"v","paragraphs":["As originally formulated by/Kaplan and Bresnan 1982l, this equatmn (15) holds if and only if f denotes an f-structure which yields the value v when applied to the attribute a. According to the oiiginal definition, the value of an application expression is undefined when f denotes a set of f-structures instead of a single function and an equation such as (15) would therefore be false. Along with Bresnan, Kaplan, and Peterson (forthcoming), we propose extending the function-application device so that it is defined for sets of functions. If s denotes a set of functions, we say that (s a)=v holds if and only if v is the generalization of all the elements ors applied to a: (16) (sa) = N (fa), for all fEs The generalization flrlf2 of two functions or f-structures fL and f2 is defined recursively as follows:","(17) Iffl = [1⁄2 then flFIf2 = fl. Iffl and f2 are f-structures, then f~rlf2 = {<a, (/el a)H(f2 a)>l a (DOM(fl)NDOM(f2) } The generalization is the greatest lower bound in the subsumption ordering on the f-structure lattice. These definitions have two consequences. The first is that v subsumes (fa) for all f ( s. Thus the properties asserted on a set as a whole must be : distributed across the elements of the set. This explains why the subject and object of (11) are distributed across both verbs without having to change the VP rule in (18). The equations on the object NP of(18) says that ( ]\" OBJ) = $. The meta.variable \" 1' \" denotes a set because the Lstructure of the VP node is the same as the f-structure of the conjoined V node, which by (14) is a set. Therefore the effect of rule (18) is that each of the elements of the 1' will have an OBJ attribute whose value is subsumed by the f-structure corresponding to apples.

There is no inconsistency, incompleteness or incoimrence in this structure. However, in LFG the completeness conditions apply to the f-structures mapped from all the c-structure nodes, whether or not they are part of the structure corresponding to the root node.

If the VCOMPs had had a subject in common (as in the sentence The girl urged and persuaded John to go) then the sentence would have been perfectly legal. Interactions with Long-Distance Dependencies Under certain circumstances a shared constituent plays different roles in the conjoined constituents.

On the other hand, if we replace the ? with $ E 1', then the f-structure tbr CONJ will be another element of tile set, on a par with the f..strnctures corresponding to the conjoined verbs. This is clearly counterintuitive and also erroneously implies that the shared elements will be distributed across the conjunction as well as the elements of the set. We observe, however, that the identity of the particular conjunction does not seem to enter into any syntactic or time|lanai generalizations, and therefor:.', that there is no motivation fro' including it in the functional structure at all. Instead, it is necessary to encode this h/errant|on only on the semantic level of representation, as defined by a s:emantic st, rltctural correspondence or \"prnjeetion\"/Kaplan 1987/. A projection is a piecewise fimction mapping from the units of one kind of structure to the urtits of another. The projection that is most central to I,FG theory is the 0 projection, the one that maps from constituent structure nodes into functional structures. But other projections arc being introduced into I,FG theory so that generalizations about various other subsystems of linguistic information can be formalized. In particular,/[lalvorsen and Kaplan 1988/have discussed the o projection that maps frmn f-structures into a range of semantic structures. Given the projection concept, the various linguistic levels can be related to one another through \"codescription\", that is, the equations that describe the mapping between gstructures and s-structures (semantic structures) are generated in terms of the same c-structure node configurations as the equations that map between c-structures and f-structures. This means that even though the s-structure is mapped from the f-structure, it may contain irfformation that is not computable from the f-structure but is strongly correlated with it via codescription. We exploit this possibility to encode the identity of the conjunction only in semantic strnctllrC.

Each of these relations also has arguments, the semantic structures corresponding to the shared subject and object ef the sentence. Notice how this structure differs from the one that we find at the functional level (e.g. (13)). Rule (30) does not assign any functional role to the conjunction, yet all the necessary syntactic and semantic information is available in the complex of corresponding structures assigned to the sentence.
