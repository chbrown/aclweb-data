We explore whether web links can replace a curated encyclopaedia, obtaining entity prior, name, context, and coherence models from a corpus of web pages with links to Wikipedia. Experiments compare web link models to Wikipedia models on well-known CoNLL and TAC data sets. Results show that using 34 million web links approaches Wikipedia performance. Combining web link and Wikipedia models produces the best-known disambiguation accuracy of 88.7 on standard newswire test data.","issn":"2307-387X","url":"https://tacl2013.cs.columbia.edu/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/494","pages":"145--156"}
