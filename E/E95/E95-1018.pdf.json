This fact tends to favour the selection of stronger systems for the base level logic, a move which is associated with loss of possibly useful resource sensitivity. This problem does not arise for the hybrid approach, which freely allows us to use weaker logics for constructing lexical types that richly encode linguistic information.","Consider firstly a hybrid system that includes only the two levels L and LP, of which clearly L will in general be more appropriate for linguistic description. Under the view of how levels are related that I have argued for, the linkage between these two levels is such that X®Y ::~ XeY is a theorem, alongside which we will find also (e.g.) X/Y ::~ Xo-Y. Note that it is the latter theorem, and its variants, that most crucially bear upon what is gained by the move to a mixed system, given that the lexical encoding of linguistic information predominantly involves the assignment of functional types. Hence, a lexical functor constructed with L connectives may be transformed to one involving LP connectives, allowing us to exploit the structural freedom of that level. 9 For","9Note that with the converse direction of linkage, as advanced by Moortgat & Oehrle (1993), but with lexical functors still constructed using L connectives, no practical use could be made of the permutative LP level in this minimal mixed system. example, in handling extraction, a 'sentence missing NP somewhere' may be derived as so-np, as in proof B of Figure 1.","Consider next a system that includes also the non-associative level NL. This additional level might be adopted as the principal one for lexieal specification, giving various advantages for linguistic analysis. For example, by having a lexieal element subcategorise for a complement that is some 'non-associative functor' (i.e. of the form At~B or B~A), we could be sure that the complement taken was a 'natural projection' of some lexical head, and not one built by composition (or other associativity based combination). On the other hand, where the freedom of associative combination is required, it is still available, given that we have (e.g.) XtgY ==v X/Y. Some categorial treatments of non-constituent coordination have depended crucially (either implicitly or explicitly) on associativity allowing, for example, subject and verb to be combined without other verb complements, making possible a 'like-with-like' coordination treatment of non-constituent coordination as in e.g. (i) Mary spoke and Susan whispered, to Bill (where the conjuncts are each analysed as s/pp). In a purely non-associative system, such as NL, such an analysis is excluded. In the hybrid approach, however, this treatment is still possible even with non-associative lexical types, provided coordination is done at the associative level, e.g. the conjuncts of (i) can be derived and coordinated as s/np since: np, (np~s)t~pp =~ s/pp is a theorem as in (5).

Alternative but equivalent formalisations of the above system are possible. Hepple (1993), for example, provides a natural deduction formalisation. Such a formalisation should readily provide the basis for a chart based approach to parsing hybrid logic grammars, after the manner of existing chart methods for use with L (KSnig 1990; Hepple 1992). A further promising possibility for efficient parsing of hybrid system grammars involves proof net reformulation, following a general scheme for such reformulation described in Moortgat (1992).

One consequence of this difference is to allow them a more standard treatment of word order (not requiring an enriched term labelling algebra). The most important 'practical' difference is that the differing directions of 'natural move-ment' will tend to foster very different linguistic accounts. We may ask which of these two contradicting views of linkage is correct. Hepple (TO AP-PEAR.) suggests that both views are possible, and may even be compatible for realisation within a single system, further extending the possibilities for the multimodal systems that can be constructed and for their potential utility.","In conclusion, I have described an approach in which different sublogics coexist and are interrelated within a single categorial system. This gives an approach which allows access to a range of different modes of characterising linguistic structure, where the specific mode of description that is used in any case can be chosen as that which is appropriate for the aspect of linguistic phenomena that is under consideration."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Barry, G., Hepple, M., Leslie, N. & Morrill, G. 1991.
