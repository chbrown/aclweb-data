The syntax-semantics interface directly implements syntactic conditions on quantifier scoping and distributivity. 1 The construction of semantic representations is guided\" by general principles governing the interaction between syntax and semantics. Each of these principles acts as a constraint to narrow down the set of possible interpretations of a sentence. Meanings of ambiguous sentences are represented by single partial representations (so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which further constraints can be added monotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence. There is no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the sentence which are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world knowledge. The advantage of UDRSs is not only that they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation but also that they are equipped with truth conditions and a proof theory that allows for inferences to be drawn directly on structures where quantifier scope is not resolved."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The semantic analysis of standard HPSG deviates from the familiar Montegovian way to construct semantic representations mainly in that it uses unifica-tion to eliminate the need for 13-reduction.

For German restrictions on scope are much more complicated because they cannot be stated independently of scrambling phenomena. In (l~-ank/Reyle 1994) the present approach is worked out for a fragment of German that deals with (i) quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by scrambling and/or movement and (ii) ambiguities that arise from the collective/distributive distinction of plural NPs. The underlying scope theory for German was developed in (Frey 1993). The analysis in (Frank/Reyle 1994) departs significantly from our earlier account in (Frank/Reyle 1992), where monotonicity was not ensured."]},{"title":"9 are","paragraphs":["bound to argument positions by the close interplay between syntactic and semantic processing; and the semantics of constituents is determined by the Semantics Principle, which governs the way of unifying the semantics of daughter constituents to build up the semantic value of the phrasal constituent: The CONTENT value is projected from the semantic head, which is defined as the syntactic HEAD-DTR in head-comp-structures, but as the ADJ-DTR in head-adjunct structures. It is important to note that the semantic contribution of quantified verb arguments is not completely projected as part of the CONTENT value. The meaning of such NPs splits into the features QUANTS, a list representing the information about quantifier scope, and NUCLEUS, containing the nonquantificational core. In the general case only the NUCLEUS is projected from the semantic head according to the Semantics Principle, while the QUANTS value gets instantiated stepwisc in interaction with the quantifier storage mechanism (Cooper Store). The mechanism of Cooper storage is built into HPSG by use of two further attributes, QSTORE and RETRIEVED, both represented as sets of quantifiers. All quantifiers start out in QSTORE by lexical definition. The Semantics Principle defines the inheritance of QSTORE to the phrasal constituents, where they may be taken out of store by an appropriately instantiated RETRIEVED value and then put into the QUANTS value of the CONTENT feature. The order in which the semantic value of quantified NPs is retrieved fixes their relative scope. To analyse sentences with scope ambiguities several parses are thus necessary. Besides the definition of appropriate restrictions to and configurations for applications of RETRIEVED the main problem we face with this kind of analysis is to modify the semantics of HPSG in such a way that it yields underspecificd representations and not sets of fully specified ones. Further shortcomings of HPSG semantics are the following. First, adjuncts (like quantificationai adverbs, modals) and also negation bear the potential to introduce scope ambiguities. In order to treat them by the same mechanism that treats the arguments of the verb their meaning representation would have to be put into store. This, however, requires further modifications of the Semantics Principle, because the treatment of head-adjunct structures differs essentially from the treatment of other configurations (see (Pollard/Sag 1994), Ch.8). 2 Second, the-re is no underspecified representation of ambiguities that arise from the distributive/collective distinction of plural NPs (neither within the'HPSG framework nor in the C(ore)L(anguage)E(ngine)3). Third, the semantic representation of indefinite NPs must be independent of the context in which they are interpreted. We do not want to switch from a universally quantified interpretation to an existentially quantified one, when we come to disambiguate the ambiguous sentence Every student who admires a philosopher reads his original writings such that a philosopher is interpreted specifically. This requirement calls for DRT as underlying semantic formalism. In the sequel of this paper we show how the extensi-on of DRT to UDRT developed in (Reyle 1993) can be combined with an HPSG-style grammar.

The second strategy involves a more radical change as it takes an existing theory of underspecifled representations and replaces the HPSG semantics by the construction principles of this theory. Let us start out with a sketch of the first approach. It will show us where its limitations are and allow us to compare different approaches to underspecification. The first thing to do, when un-specifying HPSG semantics, is to relax the retrieval operation. This must be done in two respects. First, we must allow NP-meanings not to be retrieved at all. This results in their relative scope not being determined. Second, we must accommodate syntactic and semantic restrictions on possible scope relations to be stated by the grammar. 5 Restrictions specifying, for example, that the subject NP must always have wide scope over the other arguments of the verb; or, that the scope of genuinely quantified NPs is clause bounded. The modifications we propose are the following. First, we incorporate the QSTORE feature into the CONTENT feature structure. This makes the NP meanings available even if they are not retrieved from QSTORE. Second, we take the value of the QUANTS feature not to be a \"stack\" (i.e. by appending new retrieved quantifiers as first elements to QUANTS), but allow any NP meaning that is retrieved at a later stage to be inserted"]},{"title":"at any place","paragraphs":["in that list.

But Q1 does not necessarily have scope over any indefinite NP introduced at level j. Those familiar with the work of Alshawi and Crouch (Alshawi/Crouch 1992) might have noticed the similarity of their interpretation mechanism and what we have achieved by our modifications to standard HPSG semantics. The elements of QUANTS play exactly the same role as the instantiated metavariables of Alshawi and Crouch. This means that we could adapt their interpretation mechahism to our partially scoped CONTENT structures. But note that we already have achieved more than they have as we are able to express the clause-boundeness restriction for generalized quantifiers. We will not go into the details and show how the truth conditions of Alshawi and Crouch have to be modified in order to apply to partially scoped CONTENT structures. We will instead go ahead and work out the limitations of what we called the first strategy. To keep things as easy as possible we restrict ourselves to the case of simple sentences (i.e. to. trivial tree structures of QSTORE and QUANTS values that consist of one single node only). In this case the QUANTS value (as well as the instantiation of metavariables) imposes a partial order on the relative scope of quantifiers. Assume we had a sentence with three quantifiers, Q1, Q2 and Q3. Then the possible lenghts of QUANTS values varies from 0 to 3. Lengths 0 and 1 leave the relative scope of Q1, Q2 and Q3 completely underspecified. Values of length 2 say that their first element always has wide scope over the second, leaving all possible choices for the third quantifier. And finally we have the fully specified scoping relations given by values of length 3. There are, however, some possibilities to restrict scope relationships that cannot be represented this way: One cannot, for example, represent the ambiguity that remains if we (or, syntax and semantics) require that Q1 and Q2 must have scope over Q3, but leaves unspecified the relative scope between Q1 and Q2; nor are we able to express a restriction that says Q1 must have scope over both, Q2 and Q3, while leaving the relative scope between Q2 and Q3 unspecified. Retrieving a quantifier Qi (or starting to calculate the truth value of a sentence by first considering this quantifier) is an operation that takes Qi and adds it to QUANTS.

To overcome the problems discussed in Section 2 we chose to depart from the semantics used in standard HPSG (Pollard/Sag 1994), and instead allow for the construction of (U)DRScs. The structure of the CONTENT attribute as well as the Semantics Principle will be changed substantially, since the construction of (U)DRSes allows for inherently different information structures and processing mechanisms.

Clause (Ill) of the Semantics Principle states the distinguished labels LS of the phrase to be identical to the distinguished labels of the HEAD-daughter.

In a (U)DRS, the partial structure of the verb has to be (weakly) subordinate to the scope of all the partial DRSes that introduce the discourse markers corresponding to the verb's arguments. This guarantees that all occurrences of discourse markers are properly bound by some superordinated DRS. The constraint is realized by clause (IV) of the Semantics Principle, the Closed Formula Principle. It guarantees that the label associated with the verb, which is identified with the distinguished minimal label of the sentential projection, is subordinated to the minimal label, or lower bound of each of the verb's arguments. Note that with quantified arguments the predicate of the verb must be subordinate to the nuclear scope of the quantifier. As defined in (3), it is in fact the nuclear scope of the quantified structure that will be accessed by the distinguished minimal label of the quantified NP. Thus the Closed Formula Principle (IV) in (5) states that in every (non-functional) head-comp-struc a further subordination restriction is unioned to the phrase's SUBORD value, which subordinates the minimal label of the head -here the minimal label associated with the verb- to the minimal label of its actual complement, which in case of a quantified argument identifies the nuclear scope.","Semantics Principle: 9 \" rLS [] ]1 ..UDRS [SUBORD., U { ~ > ~} U[~] U[~]"]},{"title":"JJ","paragraphs":["LCONDS [] uI-fl",".head-comp-st.ruc","H-DTR.

As plural NPs introduce a quantificational condition when they are interpreted distributively but behave like indefinites when interpreted collectively, in a representation of their meaning that is underspecified with respect to the distributive/collective ambiguity plural NPs must be marked as potentially scope bearing. This can be achieved if in the lexicon entry of a plural determiner (6) we do not completely specify the relation between the minimal label 112 and the maximal label l~, but only require that 112 is weakly subordinate to 11. This weak subordination relation will be further restricted to either identity or strict subordination when more information is available from the semantic or pragmatic context that allows the ambiguity to be resolved.

Note that genuine quantifiers as well as distributive readings of plural NPs differ in their scope potential from indefinite NPs and collectivcly interpreted plural NPs. Whereas the latter may take arbitrarily wide scope, the scope of the former is clause bounded, i.e. they are allowed to take scope only over elements that appear in their local domain. We implement this restriction by requiring that the maximal label of a generalized quantifier be subordinate to the distinguished label that identifies the upper bound of the local domain. For plural NPs, a similar constraint must be stated in case a distributive reading is chosen which specifies the plural NP as scope bearing. The distinction between scope bearing and not scope bearing NPs was defined by strict subordination and identity of the distinguished labels, respectively. In case a distributive reading is chosen by the clauses for plural disambiguation, to be stated below, the relation of weak subordination in (6), is strengthened to strict subordination. Yet, plural disambiguation may take place rather late in subsequent discourse, while the syntactic constraints for quantificational scope can only be determined locally. The Quantitier Scope Principle (V) will therefore introduce conditionalized subordination restrictions to define the clause-boundedness of both generalized quantifiers and distributively quantified plural NPs. ~2 For finite sentences the local domain for quantified verb arguments comes down to the local IP projection (Frey 1993). In a functional HPSG grammar (see (Frank 1994)) this local domain corresponds to the functional projection of the finite VP. The distinguished maximal label lmax which identifies the upper bound of the local domain for quantified vcrb arguments will therefore be instantiated by the complementizer heading a finite sentence, as in (7).","X2The scoping principles described in (Frank/lleyle 1994) further account for the scope restrictions of generalized quantifiers and distributive plural NPs."]},{"title":"13","paragraphs":["Due to the projection of the distinguished labels by clause (III) of the Semantics Principle and the definition of functional categories, the upper bound for the local domain of quantifier scope,"]},{"title":"lma~,","paragraphs":["is available throughout the extended projection, where clause (V) of the Semantics Principle, the Quantifier Scope Principle, applies.

The new formalism comes closer to a principle based construction of semantic structure and, therefore, is more in the spirit of HPSG philosophy than its standard approach. Furthermore the new formalism overcomes a number of shortcomings of the standard approach in a natural way. In particular, we presented an HPSG grammar for English that defines a syntax-semantics interface for the construction of U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s. The construction is guided by general principles, which clearly identify the interaction between the modules, i.e. the \"interface\" between syntax and semantics. In the fragment we defined underspecificied representations for quantificational structures and plural NPs. The principles governing the interaction of syntax and semantics specify scoping relations for quantifiers and quantificational readings of plural NPs. In addition to the syntax/semantics interface the Semantics Principle developed in this paper defines a clear interface to contextual and pragmatic knowledge. This interface allows reasoning modules to interact with semantics construction. The approach taken here can, therefore, be generalized to disambiguation problems other than the collective/distributive ambiguity as well as to anaphora resolution. A further issue to which the present account is directly related is incremental interpretation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abb, B./ Malenborn, C. 1994. Adjuncts in HPSG. In: Trost, H.
