We provide a general tool that brings together these developments by compiling sorted feature terms into a Prolog term representation, so that techniques from logic programming and logic grammars can be used to provide efficient processing models for sorted feature grammars.","In this introductory section, we discuss the advantages of sorted feature formalisms, and of the logic grammar paradigm, and show how the two developments can be combined. The following sections describe the ProFIT language which provides sorted feature terms for Prolog, and its implementation. 1.1 Grammar Development in Sorted","Feature Formalisms Sorted feature formalisms are often used for the development of large-coverage grammars, because they are very well suited for a structured description of complex linguistic data. Sorted feature terms have several advantages over Prolog terms as a representation langauge.","1. They provide a compact notation. Features that are not instantiated can be omitted; there is no need for anonymous variables.","2. Features names are mnemonic, argument positions are not.","3. Adding a new feature to a sort requires one change in a declaration, whereas adding an argument to a Prolog functor requires changes (mostly insertion of anonymous variables) to every occurence of the functor.","4. Specification of the subsort relationship is more convenient than constructing Prolog terms which mirror these subsumption relationships.","Implementations of sorted feature formalisms such as TDL (Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1994), ALE (Carpenter, 1993), CUF (DSrre and Dorna, 1993), TFS (Emele and Zajac, 1990) and others have been used successfully for the development and testing of large grammars and lexicons, but they may be too slow for actual use in applications"]},{"title":"180","paragraphs":["because they are generally built on top of Prolog or LISP, and can therefore not be as efficient as the built-in unification of Prolog.

This includes work on","• Compiling grammars into efficient parsers and generators: compilation of DCGs into (top-down) Prolog programs, left-corner parsers (BUP), LR parsers, head-corner parsers, and semantic-head driven generators.","• Use of recta-programming for self-monitoring to ensure generation of unambiguous utterances (Neumann and van Noord, 1992)","• Work in the area of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) to learn frequently used' structures (Samuelsson, 1994)","• Tabulation techniques, from the use of well-formed substring tables to the latest developments in Earley deduction, and memoing techniques for logic programming (Neumann, 1994)","• Work based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) to provide processing models for principle-based grammars (Matiasek, 1994)","• Using coroutining (dif, freeze etc.) to provide more efficient processing models • Partial deduction techniques to produce more efficient grammars • Using Prolog and its indexing facilities to build up a lexicon database","Since much of this work involves compilation of grammars into Prolog programs, such programs can immediately benefit from any improvements in Prolog compilers (for example the tabulation provided by XSB Prolog can provide a more efficient implementation of charts) which makes the grammars more usable for NLP systems. 1.3 Combining Logic Grammars and","Sorted Feature Formalisms It has been noted that first-order Prolog terms provide the equivalent expressive power as sorted feature terms (Mellish, 1992). For example, Carpenter's typed feature structures (Carpenter, 1992) can easily be represented as Prolog terms, if the restriction is given up that the sort hierarchy be a bounded complete partial order.","Such compilation of sorted feature terms into Prolog terms has been successfully used in the Core Language Engine (CLE) (Alshawi, 1991) and in the Advanced Linguistic Engineering Platform (ALEP), (Alshawi et al., 1991). 2 ProFIT extends the compilation techniques of these systems through the handling of multi-dimensional inheritance (Erbach, 1994), and makes them generally available for a wide range of applications by translating programs (or grammars) with sorted feature terms into Prolog programs.","ProFIT is not a grammar formalism, but rather extends any grammar formalism in the logic grammar tradition with the expressive power of sorted feature terms. 2 The ProFIT Language The set of ProFIT programs is a superset of Prolog programs. While a Prolog program consists only of definite clauses (Prolog is an untyped language), a ProFIT program consists of datatype declarations and definite clauses. The clauses of a ProFIT program can make use of the datatypes (sorts, features, templates and finite domains) that are introduced in the declarations. A ProFIT program consists of:","• Declarations for sorts","• Declarations for features","• Declarations for templates","• Declarations for finite domains","• Definite clauses 2.1 Sort Declarations In addition to unsorted Prolog terms, ProFIT allows sorted feature terms, for which the sorts and features must be declared in advance.","The most general sort is top, and all other sorts must be subsorts of top.

Two terms which are of an extensional sort are only identical if they.have a most specific sort (which has no subsort), and if all features are instantiated to ground terms. If a sort is not declared as extensional, it is intensional. Two intensional terms are identical only if they have been unified. 2.2 Feature Declarations Unlike unsorted feature formalisms (such as PATR-II), where any feature can be added to any structure, ProFIT follows the notion of appropriateness in Carpenter's logic of typed feature structures (Carpenter, 1992), and introduces features for particular sorts. For each sort, one must declare which features are introduced by it. The features introduced by a sort are inherited by all its subsorts, which may also introduce additional features. A feature must be introduced only at one most general sort. This makes it possible to provide a notation in which the sort name can be omitted since it can be inferred from the use of a feature that is appropriate for that sort.","This notion of appropriateness is desirable for structuring linguistic knowledge, as it prevents the ad-hoc introduction of features, and requires a careful design of the sort and feature hierarchy. Appropriateness is also a prerequisite for compilation of feature terms into fixed-arity Prolog terms.","Each feature has a sortal restriction for its value. If a feature's value is only restricted to be of sort top, then the sortal restriction can be omitted.

If a sort has subsorts and introduces features, these are combined in one declaration.","binary_tree > Ileal, internal_node] intro [label].","int ernal_node intro [left_daughter:binary_tree,","right_daught er: binary_tree]. 2.3 Sorted Feature Terms On the basis of the declarations, sorted feature terms can be used in definite clauses in addition to and in combination with Prolog terms. A Prolog term can have a feature term as its argument, and a feature can have a Prolog term as its value. This avoids potential interface problems between different representations, since terms do not have to be translated between different languages. As an example, semantic representations in first-order terms can be used as feature values, but do not need to be encoded as feature terms.","Sorted feature terms consist of a specification of the sort of the term (4), or the specification of a feature value (5), or a conjunction of terms (6). A complete BNF of all ProFIT terms is given in the appendix.","< Sort (4) Feature ! Value (5) Term ~ Term (6)","The following clauses (based on HPSG) state that a structure is saturated if its subcat value is the empty list, and that a structure satisfies the Head Feature Principle (hfp) if its head features are identical with the head features of its head daughter. 3 Note that these clauses provide a concise notation because uninstantiated features can be omitted, and the sorts of structures do not have to be specified explicitly because they can be infered from use of the features. saturated ( synsem ! local ! cat ! subcat ! <elist ).","hfp ( synsem ! local ! cat ! head ! X dtrs ! head_dr r ! synsem ! local ! cat ! head ! X ).","Note that conjunction also provides the possiblity to tag a Prolog term or feature term with a variable (Var ~ Term). 2.4 Feature Search In the organisation of linguistic knowledge, feature structures are often deeply embedded, due to the need to group together sets of features whose value can be structure-shared. In the course of grammar development, it is often necessary to change the \"location\" of a feature in order to get the right structuring of information.","Such a change of the '~feature geometry\" makes it necessary to change the path in all references to a feature. This is often done by introducing templates whose sole purpose is the abbreviation of a path to a feature.","ProFIT provides a mechanism to search for paths to features automatically provided that the sortal restrictions for the feature values are strong enough to ensure that there is a unique minimal path. A path is minimal if it does not contain any repeated features or sorts.","3These clauses assume appropriate declarations for the sort elist, and for the features synsem, local, cat, subcat, head, dtrs and head_dtr."]},{"title":"182","paragraphs":["The sort from which to start the feature search must either be specified explicitly (7) or implicitly given through the sortal restriction of a feature value, in which case the sort can be omitted and the expression (8) can be used.","Sort >>> Feature ! Term (7)",">>> Feature ! Term (8)","The following clause makes use of feature search","to express the Head Feature Principle (hfp).","hfp( sign>>>head !X","dtrs!head_dtr} >>>head!X ).","While this abbreviation for feature paths is new for formal description languages, similar abbreviatory conventions are often used in linguistic publications. They are easily and unambiguously understood if there is only one unique path to the feature which is not embedded in another structure of the same sort. 2.5 Templates The purpose of templates is to give names to frequently used structures. In addition to being an abbreviatory device, the template mechanism serves three other purposes.","• Abstraction and interfacing by providing a","fixed name for a value that may change,","• Partial evaluation,","• Functional notation that can make specifica-","tions easier to understand.","Templates are defined by expressions of the form (9), where Name and Value can be arbitrary ProFIT terms, including variables, and template calls. There can be several template definitions with the same name on the left-hand side (relational templates). Since templates are expanded at compile time, template definitions must not be recursive.","Name := Value, (9)","Templates are called by using the template name prefixed with © in a ProFIT term.","Abstraction makes it possible to change data structures by changing their definition only at one point. Abstraction also ensures that databases (e.g. lexicons) which make use of these abstractions can be re-used in \"different kinds of applications where different datastructures represent these abstractions.","Abstraction through templates is also useful for defining interfaces between grammars and processing modules. If semantic processing must access the semantic representations of different grammars, this can be done if the semantic module makes use of a template defined for each grammar that indicates where in the feature structure the semantic information is located, as in the following example for HPSG. semantics (synsem ! local !cont ! Sem) : = Sem.","Partial evaluation is achieved when a structure (say a principle of a grammar) is represented by a template that gets expanded at compile time, and does not have to be called as a goal during processing.","We show the use of templates for providing functional notation by a simple example, in which the expression ©first(X) stands for the first element of list X, and ~rest(X) stands for the tail of list X, as defined by the following template definition. first([First J Rest]) := First. rest([FirstlRest]) := Rest.","The member relation can be defined with the following clauses, which correspond very closely to the natural-language statement of the member relation given as comments. Note that expansion of the templates yields the usual definition of the member relation in Prolog. Y, The first element of a list ~, is a member of the list. member (@first (List), List). ~, Element is a member of a list Y, if it is a member of the rest of the list member(Element,List) :-","member (Element, @rest (List)).","The expressive power of an n-place template is the same as that of an n+l place fact. 2.6 Disjunction Disjunction in the general case cannot be encoded in a Prolog term representation. 4 Since a general treatment of disjunction would involve too much computational overhead, we provide disjunctive terms only as syntactic sugar. Clauses containing disjunctive terms are compiled to several clauses, one for each consistent combination of disjuncts. Disjunctive terms make it possible to state facts that belong together in one clause, as the following formulation of the Semantics Principle (s em_p) of HPSG, which states that the content value of a head-adjunct structure is the content value of the adjunct daughter, and the content value of the other headed structures (head-complement, head-marker, and head-filler structure) is the content value of the head daughter. sem_p ( (<head_adj",">>>cont!X ~ >>>adj dtr!>>>cont!X )","or","( ( <head_comp or <head_marker or <head_filler ) ~ >>>coat !Y ~ >>>head_dtr !>>>coat !Y ) ).","For disjunctions of atoms, there exists a Prolog term representation, which is described below. 4see the complexity analysis by Brew (Brew, 1991)."]},{"title":"183","paragraphs":["2.7 Finite Domains For domains involving only a finite set of atoms as possible values, it is possible to provide a Prolog term representation (due to Colmerauer, and described by Mellish (Mellish, 1988)) to encode any subset of the possible values in one term.","Consider the agreement features person (with values 1, 2 and 3) and number (with values sg and pl). For the two features together there are six possible combinations of values (l&;sg, 2&sg, 3&sg, l&pl, 2&pl, 3&pl). Any subset of this set of possible values can be encoded as one Prolog term. The following example shows the declaration needed for this finite domain, and some clauses that refer to subsets of the possible agreement values by making use of the logical connectives \" (negation), & (conjunction), or (disjunction).5","agr fin_dom [1,2,3] * [sg,pl]. verb(sleeps,3&sg). verb(sleep, -(3&sg)). verb(am, l&sg). verb(is, 3&sg). verb(are, 2 or pl). np('I' , l&sg) . np(you, 2~agr).","This kind of encoding is only applicable to domains which have no coreferences reaching into them, in the example only the agreement features as a whole can be coreferent with other agreement features, but not the values of person or number in isolation. This kind of encoding is useful to avoid the creation of choice points for the lexicon of languages where one inflectional form may correspond to different feature values. 2.8 Cyclic Terms Unlike Prolog, the concrete syntax of ProFIT allows to write down cyclic terms by making use of conjunction:","x & ~(x).","Cyclic terms constitute no longer a theoretical or practical problem in logic programming, and al-most all modern Prolog implementations can per-form their unification (although they can't print them out). Cyclic terms arise naturally in NLP through unification of non-cyclic terms, e.g., the Subcategorization Principle and the Spec Principle of HPSG.","ProFIT supports cyclic terms by being able to print them out as solutions. In order to do this,","SThe syntax for finite domain terms is Terra,Domain. However, when atoms from a finite domains are combined by the conjunction, disjunction and negation connectives, the specification of the domain can be omitted. In the example, the domain must only be specified for the value 2, which could otherwise be confused with the integer 2. the dreaded occur check must be performed. Since this must be done only when results are printed out as ProFIT terms, it does not affect the runtime performance."]},{"title":"3 From ProFIT terms to Prolog terms","paragraphs":["3.1 Compilation of Sorted Feature Terms The compilation of sorted feature terms into a Prolog term representation is based on the following principles, which are explained in more detail in (Mellish, 1988; Mellish, 1992; Schgter, 1993; Erbach, 1994).","• The Prolog representation of a sort is an in-stance of the Prolog representation of its supersorts.","• Features are represented by arguments. If a feature is introduced by a subsort, then the argument is added to the term that further instantiates its supersort.","• Mutually exclusive sorts have different functots at the same argument position, so that their unification fails.","We illustrate these principles for compiling sorted feature terms into Prolog terms with an example from aPse.

A finite domain with n possible domain elements is represented by a Prolog term with n + 1 arguments. Each domain element is associated with a pair of adjacent arguments. For example, the agreement domain agr from section 2.7 with its six elements (l&sg, 2&sg, 3&sg, l~:pl, 2~:pl, 3&pl) is represented by a Prolog term with seven arguments."]},{"title":"Sagr(1,A,B,C,D,E,O)","paragraphs":["Note that the first and last argument must be different.

Declaration files that contain information for compilation, derived from the declarations.","2. A program file (a Prolog program) that contains the clauses, with all ProFIT terms compiled into their Pro]og term representation.","The program file is compiled on the basis of the declaration files. If the input and output of the program (the exported predicates of a module) only make use of Prolog terms, and feature terms are only used for internal purposes, then the program file is all that is needed. This is for example the case with a grammar that uses feature terms for grammatical description, but whose input and output (e.g. graphemic form and logical form) are represented as normal Prolog terms.","Declarations and clauses can come in any order in a ProFIT file, so that the declarations can be written next to the clauses that make use of them. Declarations, templates and clauses can be distributed across several files, so that it becomes possible to modify clauses without having to re-compile the declarations, or to make changes to parts of the sort hierarchy without having to re-compile the entire hierarchy.","Sort checking can be turned off for debugging purposes, and feature search and handling of cyclic terms can be turned off in order to speed up the compilation process if they are not needed.","Error handling is currently being improved to give informative and helpful warnings in case of undefined sorts, features and templates, or cyclic sort hierarchies or template definitions.","For the development of ProFIT programs and grammars, it is necessary to give input and output and debugging information in ProFIT terms, since the Pro]og term representation is not very readable.

It is very likely that the most efficient commercial Prolog systems, which provide a basis for the implementation of NLP systems, will conform to the proposed ISO standard. Since the ISO standard includes neither inheritance hierarchies nor feature terms (which are indispensible for the development of large grammars, lexicons and knowledge bases for NLP systems), a tool like ProFIT that compiles sorted feature terms into Prolog terms is useful for the development of grammars and lexicons that can be used for applications. ProFIT is not a grammar formalism, but rather aims to extend current and future formalisms and processing models in the logic grammar tradition with the expressive power of sorted feature terms. Since the output of ProFIT compilation are Prolog programs, all the techniques developed for the optimisation of logic programs (partial evaluation, tabulation, indexing, program transformation techniques etc.) can be applied straightforwardly to improve the performance of sorted feature grammars. 6 Acknowledgements This work was supported by","• The Commission of the European Communities through the project LRE-61-061 \"Reusable Gratnmatical Resources\", where it has been (ab-)used in creative ways to prototype extensions for the ALEP formalism such as set descriptions, linear precedence constraints and guarded constraints (Manandhat, 1994; Manandhar, 1995).","* Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Special Research Division 314 \"Artificial Intelligence - Knowledge-Based Systems\" through project N3 \"Bidirectional Linguistic Deduc-tion\" (BiLD), where it is used to compile typed feature grammars into logic grammars, for which bidirectional NLP algorithms are developed, and","• Cray Systems (formerly PE-Luxembourg), with whom we had fruitful interaction concerning the future development of the ALEP system-.","Some code for handling of finite domains was adapted from a program by Gertjan van Noord.
