In this paper, we only consider events and states, together termed eventualities in (Bach, 1981). In narrative sequences, event clauses seem to advance the narrative time, while states block its progression. The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in (Hinrichs, 1986) and (Partee, 1984), is based on the notion of reference time, originally proposed by Reichenbach (1947).","Reichenbach's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices: the utterance time, event time and reference time. The reference time according to (Reichenbach, 1947) is determined either by context, or by temporal adverbials. 2.1 St unified analysis of temporal","anaphora Hinrichs' and Partee's use of a notion of reference time, provides for a unified treatment of temporal anaphoric relations in discourse, which include narrative progression especially in sequences of simple past tense sentences, temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses, introduced by a temporal connective. This concept of reference time is no longer an instant of time, but rather, an interval. This approach can be summarized as follows: in the processing of a discourse, the discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some contextually determined reference time. Further event clauses in the discourse introduce a new event, which is included within the then-current reference time. Each such event also causes the reference time to be updated to a time 'just after' (Partee, 1984) this event. State clauses introduce new states, which include the current reference time, and do not update it.","As an example of such an analysis consider the following narrative discourse (Partee, 1984):"]},{"title":"(5) John got up, went to the window, and raised the blind. It was light out. He pulled the blind down and went back to bed. He wasn't ready to face the day.

The 'n' in the top DRS is a mnemonic for 'now'- the utterance time. The first event in the discourse, el - John's getting up - is interpreted relative to a contextually understood reference time, r0. The event et is included in the current reference time, r0. A new reference time marker, rl is then introduced, rl lies immediately after r0 (recorded as r0 _~ rl). rl serves as the current reference time for the following event e2. We continue in this fashion, updating the reference time, until the second sentence in the discourse is processed. This sentence denotes a state, sl, which includes the then-current reference time. ro el rl e2 r2 e3 81 ro < n el C_ ford ~_ rl rl < he2 C rlrl ~r2 r2 < ne 3 C r2r2 C Sl el: I John get up J e2: . . .

They introduce a reference time, which overrides the current reference time, and provides an anaphoric antecedent for the tense in the main clause. This mechanism is used to explain how tense and temporal adverbials can combine to temporally locate the occurrence, without running into problems of relative scope (ttinrichs, 1988). The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time, whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time.","When-clauses, for example, introduce a new reference time, which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse. The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression: a state includes its reference time, while an event is included in it.

Constructing a similar DRS for such sentences gives the wrong truth conditions. For example, Figure la shows a DRS for sentence 1, according to the principles above, rl - the reference time, used for the interpretation of the main clause is placed in the universe of the antecedent box. Because the temporal connective is 'before', rl is restricted to lie before el. The embedding conditions determine, that this reference time be universally quantified over, causing an erroneous reading in which for each event, el, of John's calling, for each earlier time rl, he lights up a cigarette. Paraphrasing this, we could say that John lights up cigarettes at all times preceding each phone call, not just once preceding each phone call. We did not encounter this problem in the DRS in Figure 4, since although the reference time rl, is universally quantified over in that DRS as well, it is also restricted, to immediately follow el. It is similarly restricted if 'before' is replaced with 'just before' or 'ten minutes before'. But, (unrestricted) 'before' is analyzed as 'some time before', and thus the problem arises. We will henceforth informally refer to this problem as Partee's quantification problem.","Partee (1984) suggests that in these cases we somehow have to insure that the reference time, rz, appears in the universe of the consequent DRS, causing it to be existentially quantified over, giv-ing the desired interpretation.

This will not be predicted by the unselective binding of quantifiers in DRT, which quantify over all the free variables in their scope, in this case women-cat pairs. According to (de Swart, 1991) Partee's quantification problem is similar- the universal quantifier in sentences such as (1) binds pairs of events and updated reference times, where the desired quant.ificational scheme is universal quantification for the event and existential for the reference time.","De Swart (1991) offers a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach, based on the analysis of quantified NPs in transitive sentences.

As such, the existential quantification in 11 has to be stipulated, whereas our analysis acquires this existential quantification 'for free'.","4 Splitting the role of reference time Our analysis of Partee's quantification problem uses a different notion of reference time than that used by the accounts in the exposition above. Following (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we split the role of the reference time, used to account for a large array of phenomena, into several independent mechanisms. This separation allows for an analysis in DRT of temporal subordinate clauses in quantified sentences, which avoids Partee's problem altogether. The mechanisms we discuss are: the location time, Rpt and perf 1. DRSs will contain temporal markers corresponding to location times and Rpts.","The location time is an interval, used to temporally locate eventualities, in accordance with their aspectual classification. Events are included in their location time (recorded in the DRS as e C t on the respective markers), while states temporally overlap their location time (recorded as s O t). The verb tense determines the relation between the location time and the utterance time e.g. if the tense is simple past, the location time lies anteriorly to the utterance time. When it is simple present, the location time coincides with the utterance time 2. Temporal adverbials restrict the location time: temporal adverbs introduce a DRS-condition on the location time, while temporal subordinate clauses introduce a relation between the event time s of the subordinate clause and the location time of the main clause. The exact temporal relation denoted by a temporal connective depends on the aspectual classes of the eventualities related by it 4. For example, in the following sentence 12, the event triggers the introduction of an event marker e, and location time marker t, into the DRS with the DRS-condition e c_ t. The past tense of the verb adds the condition t < n. In sentence 13, the location time of the event in the main clause is restricted to fall (just) after the event time of the event of the subordinate clause. (12) Mary wrote the letter. (13) Mary wrote the letter when Bill left.","1An additional mechanism is the TPpt, which for simplicity's sake will not be discussed in this paper.","~Since the utterance time, n is a point in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), the overlap relation between a state that holds in the present and n reduces to inclusion.","3The event time t of an eventuality e is the smallest interval which includes e (recorded as t ="]},{"title":"loc(e)).","paragraphs":["4For the sake of the current presentation, we as-sume the following relations for When: if both the"]},{"title":"when-clause","paragraphs":["and the main clause denote states, then their respective time indices overlap. If both are events then the times are temporally close, with the exact relation undetermined. When one is a state and one an event, then the time index of the state includes that of the event cf. (Hinrichs, 1986). 264","Narrative progression is dealt with by using the feature Rpt (or reference point). The Rpt can be either an event or a time discourse marker, already present in the DRS (recorded as assignment Rpt := e). Eventualities are interpreted with respect to the Rpt - events are taken to follow the current Rpt, while states include it. The Rpt is reset during the processing of the discourse. Note that in a 'terminal' DRS (ready for an embedding test), all the auxiliary Rpts 'disappear' (do not participate in the embedding).","The perfect is analyzed by using the notion of a nucleus (Moens and Steedman, 1988) to account for the inner structure of an eventuality. A nucleus is defined as a structure containing a preparatory process, culmination and consequent state. The categorization of verb phrases into different aspectual classes can be phrased in terms of which part of the nucleus they refer to. The perfect is seen in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) as an aspectual operator. The eventualities described by the perfect of a verb refer to the consequent state of its nucleus. For example, the following sentence 14 denotes the state, s, holding at the present, that Mary has met the president. This state is a result of the event e, in which Mary met the president.\" Temporally, the state s starts just when e ends, or as it is put in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993):e and s abut, (represented as e DCs). (14) Mary has met the president."]},{"title":"5 An alternative solution","paragraphs":["By extending the analysis of temporal subordinate clauses in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), to sentences which include quantification over eventualities, we can propose an alternative DRT solution to Partee's quantification problem. As in (Partee, 1984), such sentences trigger box-splitting. But now, the location time of the eventuality in the subordinate clause serves as the antecedent for the location time of the eventuality in the main clause. In this approach, each of the relevant temporal markers resides in its appropriate box, yielding the correct quantificational structure. This quantification structure does not need to be stipulated as part of the Q-adverb's meaning, but arises directly from the temporal system. We illustrate this analysis by constructing a DRS in Figure lb for sentence 1.","In this DRS, n denotes the utterance time. The subordinate clause triggers the introduction of an event marker, e, with its event time marker t. The main clause triggers the introduction of an event marker e ~, and its location time marker t ~, with the DRS-condition e' C t ~. The assymetry in using the event time for e and the location time for e ~ arises from the interpretation rules of temporal connectives (for both quantified and non-quantified sentences). Since the temporal connectire in this sentence is before, the relation between these two markers is one of precedence.","We adopt a suggestion by Chierchia in (Partee, 1984), that the whole implication be rendered as a state. This state is no longer an atomic eventuality. It is a complex state denoting John's habit. This state holds during the present, and so its location time is n.","This solution is not prone to de Swart's (1991) criticism against the naive solution of moving the reference time to the right DRS. The temporal clause may be processed before the main clause, since t', the location time of e', which 'replaces' rl, the reference time of Partee's analysis, as the temporal index of the eventuality in the the main clause, arises from processing the main clause (not updating the reference time of the subordinate clause)."]},{"title":"6 Additional phenomena","paragraphs":["In this section we present some applications of our analysis to related constructions. First, we consider the past perfect, as in sentence 2. De Swart (1991) gives this example to illustrate the inability to interpret temporal connectives without the use of the reference times. According to (de Swart, 1991), the subordinate clause determines the reference time of the verb, which lies anteriorly to the event time. Trying to use the event times would give the wrong analysis. This would seem to be troublesome for our approach, which uses the location time of the event in the main clause, and not its reference time. However, this is not a problem, since our analysis of the perfect by the use of the operator perf, analyses the eventuality referred to by the main clause, as the result state of a previous event. The temporal relation in the sentence is inclusion between the event time of Anne's coming home, and the location time of the result state of Paul's already having prepared dinner.","Next, we consider narrative progression in quantified contexts, as in sentence 3. The basic construction is just the same as in the paradigm structure, but now we have narrative progression in the consequent box. This narrative progression is handled as ordinary narrative progression in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), i.e. by resetting the Rpt. The DRS in Figure 5 describes the complex state sl, that after each event of John's coming home, there is a sequence of subsequent events according to his activities.","Finally, we deal with sentences such as (4), which contain an iteration of an implicit generic quantifier and always. The situation described by John's always squinting when the sun is shining is analyzed as a complex state s3.
