SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation. SRs may have different applications in NLP, specifically, they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection (WSS, as in (Hirst, 1987)), with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones (Whittemore et al., 1990) and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement (Basili et al., 1992). Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs (both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work (Levin, 1992)).","The aim of our work is to explore the feasibility of using an statistical method for extracting SRs from on-line corpora. Resnik (1992) developed a method for automatically extracting class-based SRs from on-line corpora. Ribas (1994a)","*This research has been made in the framework of the Acquilex-II Esprit Project (7315), and has been supported by a grant of Departament d'Ensenyament, Generalitat de Catalunya, 91-DOGC-1491. performed some experiments using this basic technique and drew up some limitations from the corresponding results.","In this paper we will describe some substantial modifications to the basic technique and will report the corresponding experimental evaluation. The outline of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we summarize the basic methodology used in (Ribas, 1994a), analyzing its limitations; in section 3 we explore some alternative statistical measures for ranking the hypothesized SRs; in section 4 we propose some evaluation measures on the SRs-learning problem, and use them to test the experimental results obtained by the different techniques; finally, in section 5 we draw up the final conclusions and establish future lines of research."]},{"title":"2 The basic technique for learning SRs","paragraphs":["2.1 Description The technique functionality can be summarized as:","Input The training set, i.e. a list of complement co-occurrence triples,"]},{"title":"(verb-lemma, syntactic-relationship, noun-lemma)","paragraphs":["extracted from the corpus.","Previous knowledge used A semantic hierarchy (WordNet 1) where words are clustered in semantic classes, and semantic classes are or-ganized hierarchically.

However, it is not obvious how to calculate class frequencies when the training corpus is not semantically tagged as is the case.

He performed an evaluation of the SRs obtained from a training set of 870,000 words of the Wall Street Journal. In this section we summarize the results and conclusions reached in that paper.","For instance, table 1 shows the SRs acquired for the subject position of the verb seek.

Evaluation of the SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (e.g, section 4.2). It would also permit measuring the utility of the SRs obtained using WordNet in comparison with other frameworks using other kinds of knowledge. Finally it would be a powerful tool for detecting flaws of a particular technique (e.g, (Ribas, 1994a) analysis).","However, a related and crucial issue is which linguistic tasks are used as a reference. SRs are useful for both lexicography and NLP. On the one hand, from the point of view of lexicography, the goal of evaluation would be to measure the quality of the SRs induced, (i.e., how well the resulting classes correspond to the nouns as they were used in the corpus). On the other hand, from the point of view of NLP, StLs should be evaluated on their utility (i.e., how much they help on performing the reference task). 4.1.1 Lexicography-oriented evaluation","As far as lexicography (quality) is concerned, we think the main criteria SRs acquired from corpora should meet are: (a) correct categorization -inferred classes should correspond to the correct senses of the words that are being generalized-, (b) appropriate generalization level and (c) good coverage -the majority of the noun occurrences in the corpus should be successfully generalized by the induced SRs.","Some of the methods we could use for assessing experimentally the accomplishment of these criteria would be:","• Introspection A lexicographer checks if the SRs accomplish the criteria (a) and (b) above (e.g., the manual diagnosis in table 1). Besides the intrinsic difficulties of this approach, it does not seem appropriate when comparing across different techniques for learning SRs, because of its qualitative flavor.","• Quantification of generalization level appropriateness A possible measure would be the percentage of sense occurrences included in the induced SRs which are effectively correct (from now on called Abstraction Ratio). Hopefully, a technique with a higher abstraction ratio learns classes that fit the set of examples better. A manual assessment of the ratio confirmed this behavior, as testing sets With a lower ratio seemed to be inducing less ~Abs cases.","• Quantification of coverage It could be measured as the proportion of triples whose correct sense belongs to one of the SRs. 4.1.2 NLP evaluation tasks","The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be evaluated are diverse. Some of them have already been introduced in section 1. In the recent literature ((Grishman and Sterling, 1992), (Resnik, 1993), ...) several task oriented schemes to test Selectional Restrictions (mainly on syntactic ambiguity resolution) have been proposed. However, we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using the following scheme. For every triple in the testing set the algorithm selects as most appropriate that noun-sense that has as hyperonym the SR class with highest association score. When more than one sense belongs to the highest SR, a random selection is performed. When no SR has been acquired, the algorithm remains undecided. The results of this WSS procedure are checked against a testing-sample manually analyzed, and precision and recall ratios are calculated. Precision is calculated as the ratio of manual-automatic matches / number of noun occurrences disambiguated by the procedure. Recall is computed as the ratio of manual-automatic matches / total number of noun occurrences."]},{"title":"115","paragraphs":["Technique Assoc & All nouns Assoc & P(cls) Assoc& Head-nouns D log - likelihood Assoc& Normalizing"]},{"title":"¢2","paragraphs":["1 Coverage (%) 95.7 95.5 95.3 93.7 92.9 92.7 88.2 74.1 Table 3: Coverage Ratio 4.2 Experimental results In order to evaluate the different variants on the association score and the impact of thresholding we performed several experiments. In this section we analyze the results. As training set we used the 870,000 words of WSJ material provided in the ACL/DCI version of the Penn Treebank. The testing set consisted of 2,658 triples corresponding to four average common verbs in the Treebank: rise, report, seek and present. We only considered those triples that had been correctly extracted from the Treebank and whose noun had the correct sense included in WordNet (2,165 triples out of the 2,658, from now on, called the testing-sample).","As evaluation measures we used coverage, abstraction ratio, and recall and precision ratios on the WSS task (section 4.1).
