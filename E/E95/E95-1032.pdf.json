But it suffers a number of drawbacks, especially when viewed from a computational perspective.","First, the precise order in which quantifiers are scoped and ellipses resolved determines the final interpretation of elliptical sentences. It is hard to see how DSP's analysis could be implemented within a system employing a pipelined architecture that, say, separates quantifier scoping out from other reference resolution operations--this would seem to preclude the generation of some legitimate readings. Yet many systems, for good practical reasons, employ this kind of architecture.","Second, without additional constraints, DSP slightly overgenerate readings for sentences like (1) 3ohn revised his paper before the teacher did,","and so did Bill. Kehler (1993a) has convincingly argued that this problem arises because DSP do not distinguish between merely co-referential and co-indexed (in his terminology, role-linked) expressions.","Third, though perhaps less importantly, higher-order unification going beyond second-order matching is required for resolving ellipses involving quarttification. This increases the computational complexity of the ellipsis resolution task.","This paper presents a treatment of ellipsis which avoids these difficulties, while having essentially the same coverage as DSP. The treatment is easily implementable, and forms the basis of the ellipsis resolution component currently used within the Core Language Engine (Alshawi et al., 1992).","Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent. The substitutions can be built up in an order-independent way (i.e. before, after or during scoping), and without recourse to higher-order unification. The treatment is similar to the discourse copying analysis of (Kehler, 1993a), and to the substitutional treatment suggested by Kamp within Discourse Representation Theory, described in (Gawron and Peters, 1990). However, we extend the notion of strict and sloppy identity to deal with more than just pronouns. In doing so, we readily deal with phenomena like scope parallelism.","While the treatment of ellipsis is hopefully of some value in its own right, a more general conclusion can be drawn concerning the requirements for a"]},{"title":"computational","paragraphs":["theory of semantics. Briefly, the standard view within formal semantics, which DSP inherit, identifies semantic interpretation with composition: interpretation is the process of taking the meanings of various constituents and composing them together to form the meaning of the whole. This makes semantic interpretation a highly order-dependent affair; e.g. the order in which a functor is composed with its arguments can substantially affect the resulting meaning. This is reflected in the order-sensitive interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution in DSP's account. In addition, composition is only sensitive to the"]},{"title":"meanings","paragraphs":["of its components. Typically there is a many-one mapping from compositions onto meanings.

Prior to reference resolution, the contextual restriction on the term would be an uninstantiated meta~variable; resolution consists of instantiating mete-variables to contextually","1This is similar to' Nerbonne's (1991) constraintbased semantics, except that he builds descriptions of logical forms, not semantic compositions. appropriate values.

This forms a (generalized) quantifier expression, whose body is obtained by discharging all occurrences of the term and it index to a variable, and abstracting over the variable. Terms and indices not dischargeable in this manner lead to uninterpretable QLFs (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992).","We represent the elliptical sentence, again abbreviated, as a (partially resolved) QLF: (5) ?P( tex~(+m, 3, ~y.name(y, 'Mary'),","~y.y ="]},{"title":"m.,jones))","paragraphs":["?P is an unresolved mete-variable.

The first substitution would ensure that there was no term(+j,...) for the second substitution to replace. The order in which substitutions apply instead depends on the order in which the expressions occur when making a top down pass through (3), such as one would do when applying semantic evaluation rules to the formula.","Note also that the term index substitution applies to the scope node, so that [+j]: is replaced by [+in]:. This ensures that the term for Mary in the ellipsis gets a parallel scope to the term for John in the antecedent. Scope parallelism may not be significant where proper names are concerned, but is important when it comes to more obviously quantifica-tional terms (section 2.3). 2.2 Evaluative Substitutions The meaning of an ellipsis is composed in essentially the same way, and from the same components, as the meaning of its antecedent. However, some changes need to be made in order to accommodate new material introduced by the ellipsis. The substitutions specify what these changes are. In the example discussed above, the meaning of the ellipsis is built up in the same way as for the antecedent, except that whenever you encounter a term corresponding to 'John' or something dependent/co-indexed with it, you it is treated as though it were the term for 'Mary' or dependent/co-indexed with it.","This means that the substitutions act as directives controlling the way in which QLF expressions within their scope are evaluated. They are not syntactic operations on QLF expressions -- they are part of the QLF object language.","The reason that substitutions are not 'applied' immediately upon ellipsis resolution is as follows. At the time of deciding on the ellipsis substitutions, the precise composition of the antecedent may not yet have been determined. (For instance the scopes of quantifiers or the contextual restrictions on pronouns in the antecedent may not have been resolved; this will correspond to the presence of uninstantiated meta-variables in the antecedent QLF.) The ellipsis should follow, modulo the substitutions, the same composition as the antecedent, whatever that composition is eventually determined to be. It makes no sense to apply the substitutions before the antecedent is fully resolved, though it does make sense to decide what the appropriate substitutions should be.","In practical terms what this amounts to is exploiting re-entraney in QLFs. The elliptical QLF will contain a predicate formed from the antecedent QLF plus substitutions. Any uninstantiated rectavariables in the antecedent are thus re-entrant in the ellipsis. Consequently, any further resolutions to the antecedent are automatically imposed on the ellipsis. This would not be the ease if the substitutions were treated as syntactic operations on QLF to be applied immediately: some re-entrant meta-variables would be substituted out of the ellipsis, and those remain-ing would not be subject to the substitutions (which would have already been applied) when they were eventually instantiated. 2.3 Scope Parallelism It was noted above that substitutions on term indices in scope nodes ensures scope parallelism. This is now illustrated with a more interesting example (adapted from Hirshbfihler as cited by DSP).","(10) A Canadian flag hung in front of every house, and an American flag did too. The antecedent has two possible seopings: a single Canadian flag in front of all the houses, or each house with its own flag. Whichever seeping is given to the antecedent, a parallel seeping should be given to the ellipsis.","A simplified QLF for (10) is (11) ?SI: and(?S2: hang(term(+c, B,...),"]},{"title":"ter~(+h,V,...)), 3, ...)))","paragraphs":["where the indices +c, +a and +h are mnemonic for Canadian flag, American flag and house.

But no such increase in complexity is required under the present treatment. 2.4 Strict and Sloppy Identity The notion of strict and sloppy identity is usually confined to pronominal items occurring in antecedents and (implicitly) in ellipses. 5 A standard example is (17) John loves his mother, and Simon does too. On the strict reading, Simon and John both love John's mother. The implicit pronoun has been strictly identified with the pronoun in the antecedent to pick out the same referent, John. On the sloppy reading Simon loves Simon's mother. The implicit pronoun has been sloppily identified with its antecedent to refer to something matching a similar description, i.e. the subject or agent of the loving relation, Simon.","The sentence (18) John read abook he owned, and so did Simon. has three readings: John and Simon read the same book; John and Simon both read a book belonging to John, though not necessarily the same one; John reads one of John's books and Simon reads one of Simon's books.","Intuitively, the first reading arises from strictly identifying the elliptical book with the antecedent-book. The second arises from strictly identifying the pronouns, while sloppily identifying the books.","4If -Fc is given wide scope over antecedent and ellipsis, the QLF is rendered uninterpretable, which is as required. As detailed in section 3, scoping +c discharges the term and its index by substituting a variable for it. But the ellipsis substitution overrides this, substituting a new term and index, -Fa. But there is no way of discharging them.","s Also to pronouns of laziness. The third from sloppily identifying both the books and the pronouns. In the literature, the first reading would not be viewed as a case of strict identity. But this view emerges naturally from our treatment of substitutions, and is arguably a more natural characterisation of the phenomena.","We need to distinguish between parallel and non-parallel terms in ellipsis antecedents. Parallel terms, like John in the example above, are those that correspond terms appearing explicitly in the ellipsis. Non-paraUel terms are those that do not have an explicit parallel in the ellipsis. (Determining which terms are parallel/non-parallel is touched on in section 4.)","For parallel terms, we have no choice about the ellipsis substitution. We replace both the term and its index by the corresponding term and index from the ellipsis. But for all non-parallel terms we have a choice between a strict or a sloppy substitution, s","A sloppy substitution involves substituting a new term index for the old one. This has the effect of reindexing the version of the term occurring in the ellipsis, so that it refers to the same kind of thing as the antecedent term but is not otherwise linked to it.","A strict substitution substitutes the term by its index.

The first reading involves scoping the book quantifier before ellipsis resolution. The other two readings only scope the quantifier after resolution, and differ in giving the pronoun a strict or a sloppy interpretation. In our account the choice of strict or sloppy substitutions for secondary terms can constrain permissible quantifier scopings. 7 But the making of these choices does not have to be in-terleaved in a precise order with the scoping of quantifiers.","Moreover, the difference between strict and sloppy readings does not depend on somehow being able to distinguish between primary and secondary occurrences of terms with the same meaning. In DSP's representation of the antecedent of (18), both NPs 'John' and 'he' give rise to two occurrences of the same term (a constant, j). The QLF representation is able to distinguish between the primary and the secondary, pronominal, reference to John. 2.5 Other Phenomena Space precludes illustrating the substitutional approach through further examples, though more are discussed in (Alshawi et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 1994b). The coverage is basically the same as DSP's:","Antecedent Contained Deletion: A sloppy substitution for every person that Simon did in the sentence John greeted every person that Simon did results in re-introducing the ellipsis in its own resolution. This leads to an uninterpretable cyclic QLF in much the same way that DSP obtain a violation of the occurs check on sound unification.","Cascaded Ellipsis: The number of readings obtained for John revised his paper before the teacher did, and then Simon did was used as n benchmark by DSP. The approach here gets the four readings identified by them as most plausible. With slight modification, it gets a fifth reading of marginal plausibility. The modification is to allow (strict) substitutions on terms not explicitly appearing in the ellipsis antecedent -- i.e. the implicit his paper in the second ellipsis when resolving the third ellipsis.","We do not get a sixth, implausible reading, provided that in the first clause his is resolved as being coindexed with the term for John; i.e. that John and his do not both independently refer to the same individual. Kehler blocks this reading in a similar manner. DSP block the reading by n more artificial restriction on the depth of embedding of expressions in logical forms; they lack the means for distinguish-ing between coindexed and merely co-referential expressions.","Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP ellipsis (Gardent, 1993) poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which ellipsis. But at the level of incorporating elliptical material once","TThe converse also holds. Giving aa antecedent term wide scope over the ellipsis renders the choice of a strict or & sloppy substitution for it in the ellipsis immaterial. During semantic evaluation of the QLF, dischaxgo ing the antecedent through scoping will substitute out all occurrence of the term Lad its index before ellipsis substitutions are applied. Note though that this order dependence applies at the level of evaluating QLFs, not constructing and resolving them."]},{"title":"233","paragraphs":["the antecedents have been determined, it appears to offer no special problems.","Other Forms of Ellipsis: Other forms of eb lipsis, besides VP-ellipsis can be handled substitutionally. For example, NP-ellipsis (e.g. Who slept? John.) is straightforwardly accommodated. PP-ellipsis (e.g. Who left on Tnesdayf And on Wednesday?) requires substitutions for form constructions in QLF (not described here) representing preposi-tional phrases. 2.6 Comparisons The use of terms and indices has parallels to proposals due to Kehler and Kamp (Kehler, 1993a; Gawron and Peters, 1990). Kehler adopts an analysis where (referential) arguments to verbs are represented as related to a Davidsonian event via thematic role functions, e.g. agent(e)--john). Pronouns typically refer to these functions, e.g. he-agent(e). In VP ellipsis, strict identity corresponds to copying the entire role assignment from the antecedent. Sloppy identity corresponds to copying the function, but applying it to the event of the ellided clause.","For Kamp, strict identity involves copying the discourse referent of the antecedent and identifying it with that of the ellided pronoun. Sloppy identity copies the conditions on the antecedent discourse referent, and applies them to the discourse referent of the ellided pronoun.","Neither Kamp nor Kehler extend their copying/substitution mechanism to anything besides pronouns, as we have done. In Kehler's case, it is hard to see how his role assignment functions can be extended to deal with non-referential terms in the desired manner. DRT's use of discourse referents to indicate scope suggests that Kamp's treatment may be more readily extended in this manner; lists of discourse referents at the top of DRS boxes are highly reminiscent of the index lists in scope nodes."]},{"title":"3 Semantic Evaluation","paragraphs":["Figure 1 defines a valuation relation for the QLF fragment used above, derived from (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Cooper et al., 1994a).

The syntactic structure underspecifies the intended composition, so that the meanings of some constituents (e.g. pronouns) and the mode of combination of other (e.g. quantifiers) are not fully specified. Further contextual information is required to fill the gaps. Again, interpretation seen as description building sits easily with this.","Preserving Information: Focusing exclusively on the results of semantic composition, i.e. meanings, can ignore differences in how those meanings were derived that can be linguistically significant (e.g. co-referential vs co-indexed terms). If this information is not to be lost, some way of referring to the structure of the compositions, as well as to their results, seems to be required."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The initial implementation of the work described here was carried out as part of the CLARE project, DTI IED4/1/1165.
