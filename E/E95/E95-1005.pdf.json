The resource-sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f-structures. The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once, allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f-structures (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982, pages 211-212) to be maintained.","However. there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance.

Since the hallmark of the linear logic approach is to ensure that f-structure contributions are ulilized exactly once in a derivation, such constructions would at first glance appear to be problematic for the approach.","We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in the treatment of coordination in other approaches is appropriately handled by exploiting the structure-sharing in LF(', f-structures. We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure.","Dalrymple et al."]},{"title":"(199aa)","paragraphs":["provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas. These formulas manipulate basic assertions of the form f~,r'.~M, for f-structures f and meaning logzc terms M. Here (r is a mapping, the semantic projectign, that relates f-structures to semantic structures. To distinguish between multiple paths entering an f-structure, we now take cr to map from sets of paths in f-structures to semantic structures. Further, the paths between f-structures are made available in the semantic space as resources. This makes it possible for the semantic formulas to exploit information about the multiple paths into an f-structure in order to account for the multiple uses of the f-structure's semantic contribution. The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation.","In Section 2, we review previous approaches to the semantics of coordination and argument shar-"]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["ing. and make note of some of their drawbacks.

As noted by Steedman and discussed by Oehrle (1990), the addition of the rule of function composition to the inventory of syntactic rules in Categorial Grammar enables the formation of constituents with right-peripheral gaps, providing a basis for a clean treatment of cases of right node raising as exemplified by sentence (1). Such examples are handled by a coordination schema which allows like categories to be conjoined, shown in (2). (2) Coordination: X CONJ X ~-.- X This schema gives rise to various actual rules whose semantics depends on the number of arguments that the shared material takes.

Rather, we seek an analysis of RNR (and of resource sharing in general) that is uniform in the semantics; such a treatment isn't available in CCG because of its tight integration between syntax and semantics. 2.2 Partee and Rooth Perhaps the most influential and widely-adopted semantic treatment of coordination is the approach of Partee and Rooth (1983). They propose a generalized conjunction scheme in which conjuncts of the same type can be combined...ks is the case with Steedman's operators, contraction inherent in the schema allows for a single shared argument to be distributed as an argument of each conjunct. Type-lifting is allowed to produce like types when necessary; the combination of the coordination scheme and type-lifting can have the effect of 'copying' an argument of higher type, such as a quantifier in the case of coordinated intensional verbs. They propose a 'processing strategy' requiring that expressions are interpreted a! the lowest possible type, with type-raising taking place only where necessary.","To illustrate.

This strategy predicts the readings generated for the examples in Section 4. It also predicts the desired reading for sentence (23), since that reading requires two quantifiers. While the reading generated by Partee and Rooth is derivable, it requires three quantifiers and thus uses QNP duplication twice, which is less preferred than the reading requiring two quantifiers which uses QNP duplication once. Also, it allows some flexibility in cases where pragmatics strongly suggests that quantitiers are copied and distributed for multiple extensional verbs; unlike the Partee and Rooth account, this would apply equally to the case where there are also intensional verbs and the case where there are not. Finally, our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example (10), since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing."]},{"title":"37 6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have given an account of resource sharing in the syntax/semantics interface of LFG. The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f-structures as resources; in this way the one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relations and meanings is maintained. The resulting account does not suffer from overgeneration inherent in other approaches, and applies equally to cases of resource sharing that do not involve coordination. Furthermore, it lends it-self readily to an extension for the intensional verb case that has advantages over the widely-assumed account of Partee and Rooth (1983).","Here we have separated the issue of arriving at the appropriate f-structure in the syntax from the issue of deriving the correct semantics from the f-structure. We have argued that this is the correct distinction to make, and have given a treatment of the second issue. A treatment of the first issue will be articulated in a future forum."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Sam Bayer, John Maxwell, Fernando Pereira, Dick Oehrle, Stuart Shieber, and especially Ron Kaplan for helpful discussion and comments.
