Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners, publishers, broadcasters, educators, and language planners. Unfortunately, dialect definition can be a time-consuming and ill-defined process. The traditional approach has been to plot isoglosses, delineating regions where the same word is used for the same concept, or perhaps the same pronunciation for the same phoneme. But isoglosses are frustrat-ing. The first problem, as Gaston Paris noted (apud Durand, 1889:49), is that isoglosses rarely coincide. At best, isoglosses for different features approach each other, forming vague bundles; at","*I thank Martin Kay, Paul Kiparsky, Tom Wasow, and a reviewer for helpful comments. worst, isoglosses may cut across each other, de-scribing completely contradictory binary divisions of the dialect area. That is, language may vary geographically in many dimensions, but the requirements we usually impose require that a specific site be placed in a unique dialect. Traditional dialectological methodology gives little guidance as to how to perform such reduction to one dimension.","A second problem is that many isoglosses do not neatly bisect the language area. Often variants do not neatly line up on two sides of a line, but are intermixed haphazardly. More importantly, for some sites information may be lacking, or the question is simply not applicable. When comparing how various sites pronounce the first consonant of a particular word, it is meaningless to ask that question if the site does not use that word. So the isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaningfully compared with isoglosses based on different sets of sites.","The third problem is that most languages have dialect continua, such that the speech of one community differs little from the speech of its neighbouts. Even though the cumulative effects of such differences may be great when one considers the ends of the continua (such as southern Italian versus northern French), still it seems arbitrary to draw major dialect boundaries between two villages with very similar speech patterns. Such conundrums led Paris and others to conclude that the dialect boundary, and therefore the very notion of dialect, is an ill-defined concept.","More recently, the field of dialectometry, as in-troduced by S~guy (1971, 1973), has addressed these issues by developing several techniques for summarizing and presenting variation along multiple dimensions. They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix, which compares each site directly with all other sites, ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites. There is however no firm agreement on just how to compute the distance matrices. Sfiguy's earliest work (1971) was based on lexical correspondences: sites differed in the extent to which they used different words for the"]},{"title":"60","paragraphs":["same concept. S~guy (1973), Philps (1987), and Durand (1989) use some combination of lexical, phonological, and morphological data. Babitch (1988) described the dialectal distances in Acadian villages by the degree to which their fishing terminology varied. Babitch and Lebrun (1989) did a similar analysis based on the varying pronunciation of/r/. Elsie (1986) grouped the Gaelic dialects on the basis of whether the vocabulary matched. Ebobisse (1989) grouped the Sawabantu languages of Cameroon by whether phonological correspondences in matching vocabulary items were complete, partial, or lacking. There seems to be a certain bias in favour of working with lexical correspondences, which is understandable, since deciding whether two sites use the same word for the same concept is perhaps one of the easiest linguistic judgements to make. The need to figure out such systems as the comparative phonology of various linguistic sites can be very time-consuming and fraught with arbitrary choices.","Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom of delineating dialect areas. Sdguy (1973:18) insisted that the concept of dialect boundaries was meaningless, and his emphasis on the gradience of language similarity has been widely maintained. Bu't those who do look for firna dialect affiliations (such as Babitch and Ebobisse) use bottom-up agglomerative techniques. The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect, and thenceforth treated as a unit. The process continues recursively until all sites are grouped into one superdialect embracing the entire language area under consideration. This yields a binary tree. But Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:44) suggest that when the emphasis in a clustering problem is on the top-level clusters--here, finding the two main dialects--then such bottom-up methods, which can potentially introduce error at each of several steps, are less reliable than top-down partitioning methods. Perhaps past researchers have used in-ferior bottom-up techniques simply because the necessary algorithms are computationally more tractable. Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a O(N 2) problem, 1 whereas considering all possible two-way partitions of tile dialect area is"]},{"title":"0(2 N).","paragraphs":["The current state of dialectometry thus presents two main questions which constitute the method-ological focus of this paper. The first deals with distance matrices. Is there a way to build accurate distance matrices that minimize editorial decisions without discarding relevant data?

The second deals with clustering. Do bottom-up or","1The overall algorithm is O(N 3) since for each ue~v group one must compute the distances between it and each of the other sites or groups. top-down techniques work best? My conclusion is that the traditional bottom-up technique works better than a typical top-down method. These conclusions are based partly on an analysis of the mathematical properties of the clusters themselves, partly on how well they correlate with analyses based on more traditional isogloss techniques, and partly on how well they compare with previously-published descriptions of dialects in a specific language, Irish Gaelic.","At one time the Gaelic languag~ group was spoken throughout Ireland, from where it spread to the Isle of Man and to much of Scotland. Currently fully native use of Gaelic is limited to a few discontiguous areas in the westernmost reaches of Ireland and Scotland. In the case of Ireland, everyone agrees that Gaelic is nowadays found in three main dialects: that of Ulster, that of Connacht, and that of Munster (0 Siadhail, 1989). But several questions are raised that are less easily answered. Do the three provinces separate out so neatly for intrinsic linguistic reasons, or simply because their speakers have become so widely separated from each other geographically as speakers in intervening areas have adopted English? Does the language of Connacht naturally group with that of Ulster or with that of Munster? And look-ing beyond Ireland, many have commented that the language of Ulster in general is similar to that of Scotland. Are Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic considered three separate languages for intrinsic linguistic reasons, or because they are spoken in different countries? To a large extent, dialectologists have found these questions difficult to answer because they accepted Paris's conundrum. For 6 Siadhail, the ultimate scientific justifica-tion ill adopting the three-dialect account is the fact that the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking territory) is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms a continuum. O Cuiv (1951:4-49) felt that there can be no dialect boundaries because transitions are gradual. Elsie (1986:240) considers a dialect to be an area where all communities are linguistically more similar to each other than any community is to any site outside the dialect. Such notions provide a very firm, absolute notion of dialecthood: a set of communities either constitutes a dialect area, or it does not. But as the dialectometrists have shown, other notions of clustering are equally scientific and may more accurately correspond to intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect."]},{"title":"2 Data","paragraphs":["The data for nay study were taken from Wagner 1958.

Feature comparison may work better if features were weighted differentially, or if the numeric values they assume were assigned less arbitrarily, or if the Manhattan-style distance computation were replaced by some formula that did not assume that the features are independent of each other.

Both group into one looselyconnected entity all the sites in Scotland, and into another all the sites in Ireland. The isogloss approach groups Manx as a cousin of the Scottish dialects, and the phonetic approach makes it a cousin of the Irish dialects, but in both cases the s of Manx is very small (less than 0.06), making it essentially intermediate between the two groups. Thus the popular notion that Scottish, Irish and Manx Gaelic are distinct entities is well supported by the analyses. Both analyses group Rathlin Island very weakly with the rest of Irish, but the s for Rathlin is so low (less than 0.09) that its grouping too is essentially arbitrary. This aligns with the fact that authorities disagree as to whether it is a dialect of Irish (as does Wagner) or of Scottish (O'Rahilly 1932:191). Except for Rathlin Island, both methods group the Irish sites into one group containing all the sites in Ulster, and another, Southern, group, which itself breaks into a group containing all the sites in Connacht and one containing all the sites in Munster. 4 Both methods agree on how the 87 sites are distributed among these dialects. This three-way division accords with the universal perception that Ulster, Connacht and Munster form the three major dialect groups. The special status of Ulster contradicts the position of O'Rahilly (1932:18) that Connacht groups with Ulster to form a Northern dialect over against Munster. But it agrees with Elsie's finding (1986:255) that that province is lexicostatistically more remote from Connacht and Munster than those two are from each other. Furthermore, Hindley reports (1990:63) that speakers of other dialects often switch off radio broadcasts in Ulster Irish, 'which is very distinctive'. Thus the classification of the major Gaelic dialects gives the same general results by both distance metrics, if one discounts Manx and Rathlin Island Gaelic, which are flagged as indifferent in both schemes. It is encouraging that the resultant dialect areas are continuous, align with traditional provincial boundaries, and agree with commonly accepted taxonomies. However, dialect groupings at narrower levels, such as the exact subgrouping of the major provincial dialects, are at this point unstable. This is no doubt to be explained by the fairly small number of mapped concepts on which the distance metrics are based (51). 5 As language 4The one site ill Co. Cavan is intermediate between tile Ulster and the Southern group. Wagner also gives two sites in Leinster. The more southern site, in Kilkenny, groups with the Southern group, and the more northern site, in Co. Louth, groups with Ulster, and indeed the county used to be considered part of that province. 5S~guy (1973) cites empirical research suggesting 65","paragraphs":["differences get smaller, one expects that more data will be required in order to elucidate them. 4 Conclusions This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its di-Meet areas, starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys. Accurate distance matrices, corresponding highly to those obtained by the tedious uncovering of thousands of isoglosses, can be obtained by averaging the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings, weighting equally all inser-tion, deletion, and substitution operations on the constituent phones. This turns out to be quite a bit more precise than the common technique of measuring distances by judging etymon identity, and requires even less editorial work. That phonetic comparison is more precise is not particularly surprising, since etymon identity ignores a wealth of phonetic, phonological, and morphological data, whereas comparing phones has the side effect of also counting higher-level variation: if words differ in morphemes, their phonetic difference is going to be high. As for clustering the sites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up agglomeration method proves superior to top-down partitioning around medoids.","Of course simply knowing the dialect areas is not the last word in dialectology. There remain such essential problems as identifying the differ-ing linguistic structures that characterize the dialects, and discovering their history. But all of these tasks will be greatly facilitated by a quick and accurate grouping of the dialects."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Babitch, Rose Mary (1988). \"The areal structure of three syntagmatic variables in the terminology of Acadian fishermen.\" In Papers from the Tenth Annual Meeting of the Atlantic Provinces Linguistic Association, pages 121-137, University College of North Wales, August 1987.
