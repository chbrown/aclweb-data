The re-","sults we present rest upon two major assumptions:","1. As many forms of anaphors (e.g., nominal and pronominal anaphors) occur within sentence boundaries (so-called intra-sentential or sentence anaphora) and beyond (inter-sentential or text anaphora), adequate theories of anaphora should allow the formulation of grammatical regularities for both types using a common set of grammatical primitives.","2. Anaphora are only one, yet very prominent phenomenon that yields textual cohesion in discourse. Adequate grammars should therefore also be easily extensible to cover non-anaphoric text phenomena (e.g., coherence relations, rhetorical predicates), which provide for additional levels of text (macro) structure, with descriptions stated at the same level of theoretical sophistication as for anaphora.","First, we will briefly compare our approach with","work done in the context of government-binding","(GB) grammar and discourse representation the:","ory (DRT). As we conceive it, binding theory as","developed within the GB framework (Chomsky,","1981; Kuno, 1987) offers one of the most sophis-","ticated approaches for treating anaphora at the sentence level of description. This has also been recognized by advocates of competing grammar formalisms, who have elaborated on GB's binding principles (cf., e.g., Pollard and Sag (1992) within the context of HPSG, whose treatment is nevertheless restricted to reflexive pronouns). In-terestingly enough, when faced with some crucial linguistic phenomena, such as topicalization, GB must assume rather complex movement operations in order to cope with the data in a satisfactory manner. Things get even more complicated when languages with relatively free word order, such as German, are taken into account. Finally, considering the case of text anaphora, binding theory has nothing to offer at all.","Another strong alternative for considering anaphora constitutes the framework of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). Its development can be considered a landmark in the model-theoretic semantic analysis of various forms of quantified sentences, conditionals, and anaphorically linked multi-sentential discourse. At this level of description, DRT is clearly superior to GB. On the other hand, its lack of an equally thorough treatment of complex syntactic constructions makes it inferior to GB. These deficits are no wonder, since DRT is not committed to any particular syntactic theory, and thus cannot place strict enough syntactic constraints on the admissible constituent structures. Focusing on the text analysis potential of DRT, its complex machinery might work in a satisfactory way for several well-studied forms of anaphora, but it necessarily fails if various non-anaphoric text phenomena need to be interpreted. This is particularly true of conceptually-rooted and pragmatically driven inferences necessary to build up textual macro structures in terms of coherence relations (Hobbs, 1982) or rhetorical structures (Mann and Thompson, 1988). This shortcoming is simply due to the fact that DRT is basically a semantic theory, not a comprehensive model for text understanding; it lacks any systematic connec-"]},{"title":"237","paragraphs":["tion to comprehensive reasoning systems covering","the conceptual knowledge and specific problem-","solving models underlying the chosen domain. Summing up, DRT is fairly restricted both with","respect to the incorporation of powerful syntactic","constraints at the sentence level and its extension","to the level of (non-anaphoric) text macro struc-","tures. GB, on the other hand, is strong with re-","spect to the specification of binding conditions at","the sentence level, but offers no opportunity at all","to extend its analytic scope beyond that sentential","level. We claim, however, that the dependency-","based grammar model underlying ParseTalk","1. covers intra-sentential anaphora at the same level of descriptive adequacy as current GB, although it provides less complex representation structures than GB analyses; these structures are nevertheless expressive enough to capture the relevant distinctions,","2. does not exhibit an increasing level of structural complexity when faced with crucial linguistic phenomena which cause considerable problems for current GB theory,","3. goes beyond GB in that it allows the treatment of anaphora at the text level of description within the same grammar formalism as is used for sentence level anaphora, and,","4. goes beyond the anaphora-centered treatment of text structure characteristic of the DRT approach in that it already accounts for the resolution of text-level ellipsis (sometimes also referred to as functional anaphora, cf. Hahn and Strube (1995)) and the interpretation of text macro structures (a preliminary study is presented in Hahn (1992)). 2 DG Constraints on Anaphora In this section, we present, quite informally, some constraints on intra-sentential anaphora in terms of dependency grammar (DG). We will reconsider these constraints in Section 3, where our grammar model is dealt with in more depth. We provide here a definition of d-binding and two constraints which describe the use of reflexive pronouns and anaphors (personal pronouns and definite noun phrases). These constraints cover approximately the same phenomena as the binding theory of GB (Chomsky (1981); for a computational treatment, cf. Correa (1988)).","Dependency structures, by definition, refer to the sentence level of linguistic description only. The relation of dependency holds between a lexical head and one or several modifiers of that head, such that the occurrence of a head allows for the occurrence of one or several modifiers (in some pre-specified linear ordering), but not vice versa. Speaking in terms of dependency structure representations, the head always precedes and, thus, (transitively) governs its associated modifiers in the dependency tree. This basic notion of government must be further refined for the description of anaphoric relations in dependency trees (we do not claim a universal status for the following constraints, but restrict their validity to the description of the German language): D-bindlng: A modifier M is d-bound by some head H, if no node N intervenes between M and H for which one of the following conditions holds: (i) node N represents a finite verb, or (ii) node N represents a noun with a possessive modifier, i.e., possessive determiners, Saxon genitive, genitival and prepositional attributes.","Based on the definition of d-binding, we are able to specify several constraints on reflexive pronouns and anaphors in DG terms: Reflexive pronoun: The reflexive pronoun and the antecedent to which the reflexive pronoun refers are d-bound by the same head. Pronominal and nominal anaphors: (i) The antecedent c~ to which an anaphor ~r refers must not be governed by the same head which d-binds 7r, unless (ii) applies. (ii) The antecedent ~ to which an anaphor r refers may only be governed by the same head H1 which d-binds 7r, if (~ is a modifier of a head Hg, H2 is governed by H1, and a precedes 7r in the linear sequence of text items. Hence, a is not d-bound by the head H1 which d-binds 7r. I","We will now illustrate the working of these constraints, starting with the consideration of reflexives. Usually, the antecedent of a reflexive pronoun is the subject of the clause to which the reflexive belongs. In (1), the subject Maria is d-bound by the same head as the reflexive sich.","(1) Mariai w~scht sichi. [Maryi washes herselfi.] Of course, the government relation between antecedent and reflexive need not be an immediate one. For instance, a preposition may occur between reflexive and verb, since the notion of d-binding does not discriminate between NPs and PPs (of. (2)). If the finite verb is a modal or auxiliary verb, one or more non-finite verbs may occur between the reflexive and the finite verb (cf. (3)).","1 The definition of d-binding roughly corresponds to the governing categoryin GB terminology, which relies upon the notion of c-command, while the latter two grammar constraints correspond to the three major binding principles of GB."]},{"title":"238","paragraphs":["(2) Mariai lacht fiber sichi."]},{"title":"[Mary/","paragraphs":["laughs about herself~.]","(3) Maria/ m5chte sichi verbessern. [Maryi wants to improve herselfi.] If an intermediate node occurs between reflexive and antecedent which denotes a noun with a possessive modifier, the reflexive is d-bound by this noun (cf. (4) vs. (5)); hence, that modifier is the antecedent of the reflexive. Though Maria is the subject of (4), only Peter can be considered the antecedent of the reflexive, since it is d-bound by the head which d-binds Peter, viz. Geschichte (cf. Fig. 1). If the intermediate noun has no possessive modifiers, the subject of the entire clause is the antecedent of the reflexive, since the reflexive is d-bound by the finite verb irrespective of the occurrence of the (object) NP (cf. (6)). erz ~a.l.t Maz£1 Gemo..h£c~te"]},{"title":"pObj~","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Dependency Tree for Examples 4 and 5 (4) Maria erz~.hlt Peters/ Geschichte fiber sich/. [Mary tells Peter's/ story about himself/.] (5) * Maria/ erz£hlt Peters Geschichte fiber sich/. [* Mary/ tells Peter's story about herself/.] (6) Maria/ erz~hlt eine Geschichte fiber sichi. [Maryi tells a story about hersel/i.] We will now consider constraints on intra-sentential anaphora (personal pronouns and definite NPs). As a general rule, the anaphor must not occupy the position of the reflexive pronoun. Hence, for all the examples given above, any of those sentences becomes ungrammatical if the reflexives are replaced by non-reflexive anaphoric expressions (of. (7) vs. (2)).","(7) * Maria/ lacht fiber siei. [* Mary/ laughs about her/.] It is also obvious that whenever the anaphor belongs to a clause which is subordinate to one that contains the antecedent, both may be coreferent: this holds independently of the ordering of antecedent and pronoun (cf. (8) vs. (11)). On the other hand, if the anaphor belongs to the matrix clause and the antecedent to the subordinate clause, coreference is excluded (cf. (9)). But one can easily think of cases where this rule is overridden. Consider, e.g., a subordinate clause preced-ing its matrix, as is always true for topicalizations. The claim that a pronoun in the superordinate clause must not be coreferent to an antecedent in a subordinate clause is then obviously false (cf. (10) and (11)). In (10), the antecedent Peteris not d-bound by the head which d-binds the anaphor er, and Peter precedes er. Therefore, coreference is possible. 2 (8) Peter/ erwartet, daft eri einen Brief bekommt. [Peter/ expects that he/ will get a letter.] (9) * Er/ erwartet, daft Peter/ e/hen Brief bekommt. [ * He/ expects that Peter/ will get a letter.] (10) DaB Peteri e/hen Brief bekommt, erwartet er/. [That Peter/ will get a letter, hei expects.] (11) DaB er/ e/hen Brief bekommt, erwartet Peter/. [That hel will get a letter, Peter/ expects.] Another special case arises if the antecedent is a modifier of the subject of a sentence. In this case the antecedent of a pronoun may be governed by the head which d-binds the pronoun. In (12) the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause, but in (13) the antecedent of the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause, and the example seems to be acceptable. In (14), where the subject Valet is modified by the genitive attribute des Gewinners, the antecedent is governed by the head which also d-binds the pronoun. Both the relative clause and the genitive attribute are modifiers of the subject, which usually occurs at the first position in the German main clause. In this case, the antecedent precedes the anaphor. Hence, coreference between anaphor and antecedent must be granted. 3 (12) Der Mann, der siei kennt, grfiflt die Fraui. [The man who knows heri greets the womani.] (13..) Der Mann, der die Frau/ kennt, grfiflt siei. [The man who knows the woman/ greets heri.] (14) Der Vater des Gewinnersi gratuliert ihm/. [The winner's/father congratulates himi.] The incorporation of an ordering constraint is even more justified if one looks at sentences which have a similar structure, but are different with respect to word order (cf. (15) vs. (16)). In (15), the subordinate clause immediately follows its head word, while in (16) the subordinate clause is extraposed. In (16) the anaphor precedes its antecedent, which is governed by the head that d-binds the anaphor. This violates the given constraints, hence coreference is excluded.","2GB explains topicalizatiou with a move of the topicalized CP into the SpecComp phrase of the highest CP, so that the pronoun does not c-commandits antecedent (in these cases movements into an A-position are assumed for which the binding principles of GB do not apply).","3GB explains this phenomenon by linking the modifiers to the subject as adjuncts. In this position, the pronoun does not c-command the antecedent, and the adjunct of the subject is also in an A-position."]},{"title":"239","paragraphs":["(15) Die Frage, ob Peteri nach Dublin fahren sollte,","konnte eri noch nicht beantworten.","[The question, whether Peteri should go to Dublin,","hei couldn't decide.] (16) * Die Frage konnte eri noch nicht beantworten,","ob Peteri nach Dublin fahren sollte.","[* The question hei couldn't decide, whether Peteri","should go to Dublin.] Structural constraints are necessary conditions, but additional criteria have to be considered when determining the antecedent of an anaphor. Morphosyntactic conditions require that a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, number and person, while a definite NP must agree with its antecedent in number only. Moreover, conceptual criteria have to be met as in the case of nominal anaphors which must subsume their antecedents at the conceptual level. Similarly, for pronominal anaphors the selected antecedent must be permitted in those conceptual roles connecting the pronominal anaphors and its grammatical head.","The DG constraints for the use of reflexives and intra-sentential anaphora cover approximately the same phenomena as GB, but the structures used by DG analysis are less complex than those of GB and do not require the formal machinery of empty categories, binding chains and complex movements (cf. Lappin and McCord (1990, p.205) for a similar argument). Hence, our proposal provides a more tractable basis for implementation."]},{"title":"3 Major Grammatical Predicates","paragraphs":["The ParseTalk model of DG (Hahn et al., 1994) exploits inheritance as a major abstraction mechanism. The entire lexical system is organized as a hierarchy of lexical classes (isac denoting the subclass relation among lexical classes), with concrete lexical items forming the leave nodes of the corresponding lexicon grammar graph. Valency constraints are attached to each lexical item, on which the local computation of concrete dependency relations between a head and its associated modifier is based. These constraints incorporate categorial knowledge about word classes and morphosyntactic knowledge involving complex feature terms as used in unification grammars.","The definition of the grammatical predicates be-low is based on the following conventions: II denotes the unification operation, 2_ the inconsistent element.

Schacht et al. 1994; Hahn et al. 1994). Word actors combine object-oriented features with concurrency yielding strict lexical distribution and distributed computation in a methodologically clean way. The model assumes word actors to communicate via asynchronous message passing. An actor can send messages only to other actors it knows about, its so-called acquaintances. The arrival of a message at an actor is called an event; it triggers the execu-tion of a method that is composed of atomic actions - among them the evaluation of grammatical predicates. As we will show, the specification of a particular message protocol corresponds to the treatment of fairly general linguistic tasks, such as establishing dependencies, properly arranging coordinations, and, of course, resolving anaphors. Consequently, any of these subprotocols constitutes part of the grammar specification proper.","We shall illustrate the linguistic aspects of word actor-based parsing by introducing the basic data structures for text-level anaphora as acquaintances of specific word actors, and then turn to the general message-passing protocol that accounts for intra- as well as inter-sentential anaphora.

The most detailed description of grammatical regularities and an associated parsing procedure has been supplied by Lappin and McCord (1990). It is based on the format of a slot grammar (SG), a slight theory variant of DG. In particular, they treat pronominal coreference and anaphora (i.e., reflexives and reciprocals). Our approach methodologically differs in three major aspects from that study: First, unlike the SG proposal, which is based on a second-pass algorithm operat-ing on fully parsed clauses to determine anaphoric relationships, our proposal is basically an incremental single-pass parsing model. Most importan't, however, is that our model incorporates the text-level of anaphora resolution, a shortcoming of the original SG approach that has recently been removed (Lappin and Leass, 1994), but still is a source of lots of problems. Third, unlike our approach, even the current SG model for anaphora resolution does not incorporate conceptual knowledge and global discourse structures (for reasons discussed by Lappin and Laess). This decision might nevertheless cause trouble if more conceptually rooted text cohesion and coherence structures have to be accounted for (e.g., textual ellipses).","A particular problem we have not yet solved, the plausible ranking of single antecedents from a candidate set, is dealt with in depth by Lappin and Laess (1994) and Hajicova et al. (1992). Both define salience metrics capable of ordering alternative antecedents according to structural criteria, several of which can directly be attributed to the topological structure and topic/comment an-notations of the underlying dependency trees."]},{"title":"243 6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have outlined a model of anaphora resolution which is founded on a dependency-based grammar model. This model accounts for sentence-level anaphora, with constraints adapted from GB, as well as text-level anaphora, with concepts close to Grosz-Sidner-style focus models. The associated text parser is based on the actor computation model. Its message passing mechanisms constitute the foundation for expressing specific linguistic protocols, e.g., that for anaphora resolution. The main advantage of our approach lies in the unified framework for sentence- and text-level anaphora, using a coherent grammar format, and the provision for access to grammatical and conceptual knowledge without prioritizing either one of them. It is also a striking fact that, given the same linguistic phenomena, structural dependency configurations are considerably simpler than their GB counterparts, though suitably expressive.","The anaphora resolution module (for reflexives, intra- and inter-sentential anaphora) has been realized as part of ParseTalk, a dependency parser which forms part of a larger text understanding system for the German language, currently under development at our laboratory. The parser has been implemented in Smalltalk; the Smalltalk system itself, which runs on a SUN SparcStation net-work, has been extended by asynchronous message passing facilities and physical distribution mechanisms (Xu, 1993). The current lexicon contains a hierarchy of approximately 100 word class specifications with nearly 3.000 lexical entries and corresponding concept descriptions from two domains (information technology and medicine) available from the LOOM knowledge representation system (MacGregor and Bates, 1987).
