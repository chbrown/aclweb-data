Accordingly, it casts its linguistic analyses in terms of a composite ontology: two independent domains -- a domain of constituency information (c-structure), and a domain of grammatical function information (f-structure) -- linked together in a mutually constraining manner. As has been amply demonstrated over the last fifteen years, this view permits perspicuous analyses of a wide variety of linguistic data.","However standard formalisations of LFG do not capture its strikingly simple underlying intuitions. Instead, they make a detour via the LFG construction algorithm, which explains how equational constraints linking subtrees and feature str.uctures are to be resolved. The main point of the present paper is to show that such detours are unnecessary. We define a specification language £ in which (most of) the interactions between c-and f-structure typical of LFG grammars can be stated directly.","The key idea underlying our approach is to think about LFG model theoretically. That is, our first task will be to give a precise -- and transparent -- mathematical picture of the LFG ontology. As has already been noted, the basic entities underlying the LFG analyses are composite structures consisting of a finite tree, a finite feature structure, and a function that links the two. Such structures can straightforwardly be thought of as models, in the usual sense of first order model theory (see Hodges (1993)). Viewing the LFG ontology in such terms does no violence to intuition: indeed, as we shall see, a more direct mathematical embodiment of the LFG universe can hardly be imagined.","Once the ontological issues have been settled we turn to our ultimate goal: providing a specification language for LFG grammars. Actually, with the ontological issues settled it is a relatively simple task to devise suitable specification languages: we simply consider how LFG linguists talk about such structures when they write grammars. That is, we ask ourselves what kind of constraints the linguist wishes to impose, and then devise a language in which they can be stated.","Thus we shall proceed as follows. After a brief introduction to LFG, 1 we isolate a class of models which obviously mirrors the composite nature of the LFG ontology, and then turn to the task of devising a language for talking about them. We opt for a particularly simple specification language: a propositional language enriched with operators for talking about c- and f-structures, together with a path equality construct for enforcing synchronisation between the two domains. We illustrate its use by showing how to capture the effect of schemata annotated rules, and the LFG uniqueness, completeness and coherence principles.","Before proceeding, a word of motivation is in order. Firstly, we believe that there are practical reasons for interest in grammatical specification languages: formal specification seems important (perhaps essential) if robust large scale grammars are to be defined and maintained. Moreover, the essentially model theoretic slant on specification we propose here seems particularly well suited to this aim. Models do not in any sense \"code\" the LFG ontology: they take it pretty much at face value. In our view this is crucial. Formal approaches","1This paper is based upon the originM formula-tion of LFG, that of Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), and will not discuss such later innovations as functional uncertainty."]},{"title":"39","paragraphs":["to grammatical theorising should reflect linguistic intuitions as directly as possible, otherwise they run the risk of being an obstacle, not an aid, to grammar development.","The approach also raises theoretical issues. The model theoretic approach to specification languages forces one to think about linguistic ontologies in a systematic way, and to locate them in a well understood mathematical space. This has at least two advantages. Firstly, it offers the prospect of meaningful comparison of linguistic frameworks. Secondly, it can highlight anomalous aspects of a given system. For example, as we shall later see, there seems to be no reasonable way to deal with LFG's --c definitions using the simple models of the present paper.

For a start, not all models are created equal. Which of them correspond to grammatical utterances of English? Of Dutch? Moreover, there is a practical issue to be addressed: how should we go about saying which models we deem 'good'? To put in another way, in what medium should we specify grammars?","Now, it is certainly possible to talk about models using natural language (as readers of this paper will already be aware) and for many purposes (such as discussion with other linguists) natural language is undoubtedly the best medium. However, if our goal is to specify large scale grammars in a clear, unambiguous manner, and to do so in such a way that our grammatical analyses are machine verifiable, then the use of formal specification languages has obvious advantages. But which formal specification language? There is no single best answer: it depends on one's goals. However there are some important rules of thumb: one should carefully consider the expressive capabilities required; and a judicious commitment to simplicity and elegance will probably pay off in the long run. Bearing this advice in mind, let us consider the nature of LFG grammars.","Firstly, LFG grammars impose constraints on 7\". Context free rules are typically used for this purpose -- which means, in effect, that constraints are being imposed on the 'daughter of' and 'sister of' relations of the tree.

Incidentally, • is essentially a piece of syntactic sugar; it could be replaced by a collection of unary modalities (see Blackburn and Meyer-Viol (1994)).

What should be done?","We see three possible responses. Firstly, we note that the model theoretic approach can al-most certainly be extended to cover constraining equations. The move involved is analogous to the way first order logic (a so-called 'extensional' logic) can be extended to cope with intensional no-tions such as belief and necessity. The basic idea -- it's the key idea underlying first order Kripke semantics -- is to move from dealing with a single model to dealing with a collection of models linked by an accessibility relation. Just as quantification over possible states of affairs yields analyses of intensional phenomena, so quantification over related models could provide a 'denotational semantics' for =~. Preliminary work suggests that the required structures have formal similarities to the structures used in preferential semantics for default and non-monotonic reasoning. This first response seems to be a very promising line of work: the requisite tools are there, and the approach would tackle a full blooded version of LFG head on. The drawback is the complexity it introduces into an (up till now) quite simple story. Is such additional complexity reMly needed?","A second response is to admit that there is a dynamic residue, but to deal with it in overtly computational terms. In particular, it may be possible to augment our approach with an explicit operational semantics, perhaps the evolving algebra approach adopted by Moss and Johnson (1994). Their approach is attractive, because it permits a computational treatment of dynamism that abstracts from low level algorithmic details. In short, the second strategy is a 'divide and conquer' strategy: treat structural issues using model theoretic tools, and procedural issues with (revealing) computational tools. It's worth remarking that this second response is not incompatible with the first; it is common to provide programming languages with both a denotational and an operational semantics.","The third strategy is both simpler and more speculative. While it certainly seems to be the case that LFG (and other 'declarative' formalisms) have procedural residues, it is far from clear that these residues are necessary. One of the most striking features of LFG (and indeed, GPSG) is the way that purely structural (that is, model theoretic) argumentation dominates. Perhaps the procedural aspects are there more or less by accident? After all, both LFG and GPSG drew on (and developed) a heterogeneous collection of traditional grammar specification tools, such as context free rules, equations, and features. It could be the case such procedural residues as --¢ are simply an artifact of using the wrong tools for talking about models. If this is the case, it might be highly misguided to attempt to capture =¢ using a logical specification language. Better, perhaps, would be to draw on what is good in LFG and to explore the logical options that arise naturally when the model theoretic view is taken as primary. Needless to say, the most important task that faces this third response is to get on with the business of writing grammars; that, and nothing else, is the acid test.","It is perhaps worth adding that at present the authors simply do not know what the best response is. If nothing else, the present work has made very clear to us that the interplay of static and dynamic ideas in generative grammar is a delicate and complex matter which only further work can resolve."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Patrick Blackburn and Wilfried Meyer-Viol. 1994.
