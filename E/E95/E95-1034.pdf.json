The formalism compositionally derives the predicate-argument structure and the information structure (e.g. topic, focus) of a sentence, and uniformly handles word order variation among arguments and adjuncts within a clause, as well as in complex clauses and across clause boundaries."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, I present a categorial formalism, Multiset CCG (based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars (Steedman, 1985; Steedman, 1991)), that captures the syntax and context-dependent interpretation of \"free\" word order in languages such as Turkish. Word order variation in relatively free word order languages, such as Czech, Finnish, German, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, is used to convey distinctions in meaning that go beyond traditional propositional semantics. The word order in these languages serves to structure the information being conveyed to the hearer, e.g. by indicating what is the topic and the focus of the sentence (as will be defined in the next section). In fixed word order languages such as English, these are indicated largely through intonation and stress rather than word order.","The context-appropriate use of \"free\" word order is of considerable importance in developing practical applications in natural language generation, machine translation, and machine-assisted translation. I have implemented a database query system in Prolog, described in (Hoffman, 1994), which uses Multiset CCG to interpret and gen: crate Turkish sentences with context-appropriate word orders. Here, I concentrate on further devel-","*I would like to thank Mark Steedman, Ellen Prince, and the support of NSF Grant SBR 8920230. oping the formalism, especially to handle complex sentences.","There have been other formalisms that integrate information structure into the grammar for \"free\" word order languages, e.g. (Sgall et al, 1986; Engdahl/Vallduvi, 1994; Steinberger, 1994). However, I believe my approach is the first to tackle complex sentences with embedded information structures and discontinuous constituents. Multiset CCG can handle free word order among arguments and adjuncts in all clauses, as well as word order variation across clause boundaries, i.e. long distance scrambling. The advantage of using a combinatory categorial formalism is that it provides a compositional and flexible surface structure, which allows syntactic constituents to easily correspond with information structure units. A novel characteristic of this approach is that the context-appropriate use of word order is captured by compositionally building the predicate-argument structure (AS) and the information structure (IS) of a sentence in parallel.","After presenting the motivating Turkish data in Section 2, I present a competence grammar for Turkish in Section 3 that captures the basic syntactic and semantic relationships between predicates and their arguments or adjuncts while allowing \"free\" word order. This grammar, which derives the predicate-argument structure is then integrated with the information structure in Section 4. In Section 5, the formalism is extended to account for complex sentences and long distance scrambling."]},{"title":"2 The Turkish Data","paragraphs":["The arguments of a verb in Turkish (as well as many other \"free\" word order languages) do not have to occur in a fixed word order.

A sentence can be divided into a topic and a comment, where the topic is the main element that the sentence is about, and the comment is the main information we want to convey about this topic. Assuming the heater's discourse model or knowledge store is organized by topics, the sentence topic can be seen as specifying an \"address\" in the heater's knowledge store (Reinhart, 1982; Vallduvi, 1990). The informational focus is the most information-bearing constituent in the sentence, (Vallduvi, 1990); it is the new or important information in the sentence (within the comment), and receives prosodic prominence in speech. These information structure components are successful in describing the context-appropriate answer to database queries. In this domain, the focus is the new or important part of the answer to a wh-question, while the topic is the main entity that the question and answer are both about, that can be paraphrased using the clause \"As for X\". In other domains, finding the topic and focus of sentences according to the context may be more complicated.","We can now explain why certain word orders are appropriate or inappropriate in a certain context, in this case database queries.

Restrictions (such that elements to the right of the verb have to be discourse-old information in Turkish) are expressed as features on the arguments of the verbal ordering functions.","What is novel about this formalism is that the predicate-argument structure and the information structure of a sentence are built in parallel in a compositional way. For example, given the following question, we may answer in a word order which indicates that \"today\" is the topic of the sentence, and \"Little Ahmet\" is the focus.

In generation, the same topic found in the database query is maintained in the answer. For wh-questions, the information that is retrieved from the database to answer the question becomes the focus of the answer. I have extended the system to also handle yes-no questions involving the question morpheme \"mi\", which is placed next to whatever element is being questioned in the sentence.

However, verbs can be focused in Turkish by placing the primary stress of the sentence on the verb instead of immediately preverbal position and by lexical cues such as the placement of the question morpheme. Thus, we must have more than one IS available for verbs, where verbs can be in the focus or the ground component of the IS. In addition, it is possible to focus the whole VP or the whole sentence, which can be determined by the context, in this case the database query: (13) a.

The syntactic component of Multiset CCG is flexible enough to derive the predicate-argument structure of simple and complex sentences without relying on word order, and it is expressive enough to capture syntactic restrictions on word order in different languages such as languages with NP or clausal islands or languages which allow discontinuous NPs or clauses. Word order is used in the ordering component of Multiset CCG to determine the information structure of a sentence. Every Multiset CCG category encoding syntactic and semantic properties is associated with an ordering category which encodes the ordering of information structure components such as topic and focus; two syntactic/semantic categories are allowed to combine to form a larger constituent only if their ordering categories can also combine. The formalism has been implemented within a database query task in Quintus Prolog, to interpret and generate simple and complex sentences with context-appropriate word orders.","Multiset CCG captures the context-appropriate use of word order by compositionally deriving the predicate-argument structure and the information structure of a sentence in parallel. It allows adjuncts and elements from embedded clauses to take part in the information structure of the matrix clause, even though they do not take part in its predicate-argument structure. Thus, this formalism provides a uniform approach in capturing the syntactic and pragmatic aspects of word order variation among arguments and adjuncts, and across clause boundaries."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Elisabet Engdahl and Enric Vallduvi.
