It goes on to investigate ways in which a corpus pre-parsed with this formalism may be processed to provide a probabilistic language model for use in the parsing of fresh texts."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in probabilistic techniques for automatic language analysis. In particular, there has arisen a distinct paradigm of processing on the basis of pre-analyzed data which has taken the name Data-Oriented Parsing.","\"Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) is a model where no abstract rules, but language experiences in the form of an analyzed corpus, constitute the basis for language processing.\" 1 There is not space here to present full justification 1. for adopting such an approach or to detail the advantages that it offers. The main claim it makes is that effective language processing requires a consideration of both the structural and statistical as-2. pects of language, whereas traditional competence grammars rely only on the former, and standard statistical techniques such as n-gram models only on the latter. DOP attempts to combine these two traditions and produce \"performance grammars\", which:","\"... should not only contain information on the structural possibilities of the general 3. language system, but also on details of actual language use in a language community... ''2 *This research was funded by a research studentship from the ESRC. My thanks also for discussion and comments to Matt Crocker, Chris Brew, David Milward and Anna Babarczy. 1Bod, 1992. 4. 2ibid. This approach entails however that a corpus has first to be pre-analyzed (ie. hand-parsed), and the question immediately arises as to the formalism to be used for this. There is no lack of compet-ing competence grammars available, but also no reason to expect that such grammars should be suited to a DOP approach, designed as they were to characterize the nature of linguistic competence rather than performance. The next section sets out some of the properties that we might require from such a \"performance grammar\" and offers a formalism which attempts to satisfy these requirements."]},{"title":"A Formalism for DOP","paragraphs":["Given that we are attempting to construct a formalism that will do justice to both the statistical and structural aspects of language, the features that we would wish to maximize will include the following: The formalism should be easy to use with probabilistic processing techniques, ideally having a close correspondence to a simple probabilistic model such as a Markov process. The formalism should be fine-grained, ie. responsive to the behaviour of individual words (as n-gram models are). This suggests a radically lexiealist approach (cf. Karttunen, 1990) in which all rules are encoded in the lexicon, there being no phrase structure rules which do not introduce lexical items. It should be capable of capturing fully the linguistic intuitions of language users. In other words, using the formalism one should be able to characterize the structural regularities of language with at least the sophistication of modern competence grammars. As it is to be used with real data, the formalism should be able to characterize the wide range"]},{"title":"272","paragraphs":["of syntactic structures found in actual language use, including those normally excluded by competence grammars as belonging to the \"periphery\" of the language or as being \"ungrammatical\". Ideally every interpretable utterance should have one and only one analysis for any interpretation of it. Considering the first of these points, namely a close relation to a simple probabilistic model, a good place to start the search might be with a right-branching finlte-state grammar. In this class of grammars every rule has the form A -4 a B (A,B E {non-terminals}, a E {terminals}) and all trees have the simple structure :","a A A-- B-- C-- D-- b B"]},{"title":"I I I I Or: c c","paragraphs":["a b c d d D (with an equivalent vertical alignment, henceforth to be used in this paper, on the right) In probabilistic terms, a finite-state grammar corresponds to a first-order Markov process, where given a sequence of states Si, Sj,... drawn from a finite set of possible states {So,..,S=} the probability of a particular state occurring depends solely on the identity of the previous state. In the finite-state grammar each word is associated with a transition between two categories, in the tree above 'a' with the transition A -4 B and so on. To calculate the probability that a string of words xl, x2, x3,.., xn has the parse represented by the string of category-states 81, $2, S3,...S=, we simply take the product of the probability of each transition: ie. l-h~l P(xi : si -4 si+l). In addition to satisfying our first criterion, a finite-state grammar also fulfills the requirement that the formalism be radically lexicalist, as by definition every rule introduces a lexical item."]},{"title":"Accounting for Linguistic Structure","paragraphs":["If a finite-state grammar is chosen however, the third criterion, that of linguistic adequacy, seems to present an insurmountable stumbling block. How can such a simple formalism, in which syntax is reduced to a string of category-states, hope to capture even the basic hierarchical structure, the familiar \"tree structure\", of linguistic expressions? Indeed, if the non-terminals are viewed as atomic categories then there is no way this can be done. If however, in line with most current theories, categories are taken to be bundles of features and crucially if one of these featflres has the value of a stack of categories, then this hierarchical structure can indeed be represented. Using the notation A [B] to represent a state of basic category A carrying a category B on its stack, the hierarchical structure of the sentence: (1) The man gave the dog a bone. can be represented as: The S [] man N [VP] gave VP [ ]","(la) the NP [NP] dog N [NP] a NP [] bone N [] Intuitively, syntactic links between non-adjacent words, impossible in a standard finite-state grammar, are here established by passing categories along on the stack \"through\" the state of intervening words. That such a formalism can fully capture basic linguistic structures is confirmed by the proof in Aho (1968) that an indexed grammar (ie. one where categories are supplemented with a stack of unbounded length, as above), if restricted to right linear trees (also as above), is equivalent to a context-free grammar. A perusal of the state transitions associated with individual words in (la) reveals an obvious relationship to the \"types\" of categorial grammar. Using a to represent a list of categories (possibly null), we arrive at the following transitions (with their corresponding categorial types alongside). The ditransitive verb 'gave' is VP [a]3 _+ NP [NP,a] (VP/NP)/NP Determiners in complement position are both: NP [a] -4 N [a] NP/N Determiner in subject position is 'type-raised '4 to: S [a] -4 N [VP,a] (S/VP)/N The common nouns are all:"]},{"title":"N [a] -4 a N","paragraphs":["In fact as no intermediate constituents are formed in the analysis, an even closer parallel is to a dependency syntax where only rightward pointing arrows are allowed, of which the formalism as presented above is a notational variant.

Knowing now that the addition of a stack-valued feature suffices to capture the basic hierarchical structure of language, additional features can be used to deal with other syntactic relations. For example, following the example of GPSG, unbounded dependencies can be captured using \"slashed\" categories. If we represent a \"slashed\" category X with the lower case x, and use the notation A(b) for a category A carrying a feature b, then the topicalized sentence: (2) This bone the man gave the puppy. will have the analysis:"]},{"title":"(2a) This S [1 bone N [S(np)] the S(np) [l man N [VP(np)]","paragraphs":["gave VP(np)[ ] the NP [] puppy N [] Although there is no space in this paper to go into greater detail, further constructions involving unbounded dependency and complement control phenomena can be captured in similar ways."]},{"title":"Coverage","paragraphs":["The criterion that remains to be satisfied is that of width of coverage: can the formalism cope with the many \"peripheral\" structures found in real written and spoken texts? As it stands the formalism is weakly equivalent to a context-free grammar and as such will have problems dealing with phenomena like discontinuous constituents, non-constituent coordination and gapping. For-tunately if extensions are made to the formalism, necessarily taking it outside weak equivalence to a context-free grammar, natural and general analyses present themselves for such constructions. Two of these will now be sketched."]},{"title":"Discontinuous Constituents","paragraphs":["Consider the pair of sentences (3) and (4), identical in interpretation, but the latter containing a discontinuous noun phrase and the former not: (3) I saw a dog which had no nose yesterday.

It has been assumed so far that we are using a right-linear indexed grammar, but such a rule is expressly disallowed in an indexed grammar and so allowing transitions of this kind ends the formalism's weak equivalence to the context-free grammars. Of course, having allowed such crossed dependencies, there is nothing in the formalism itself that will disallow a similar analysis for a discontinuity unacceptable in English such as: (5) I saw a yesterday dog. This does not present a problem, however, as in DOP it is information in the parsed corpus which determines the structures that are possible. There is no need to explicitly rule out (5), as the transition NP [hi --+ a [N] will be vanishingly rare in any corpus of even the most garbled speech, while the transition N [hi --+ a [S(rel)] is commonly met with in both written and spoken English."]},{"title":"Non-Constituent Coordination","paragraphs":["The analysis of standard coordination is shown in"]},{"title":"(6): 274","paragraphs":["Fido S [] gnawed VP"]},{"title":"[]","paragraphs":["a NP [VP(+)]","(6) bone N [VP(+)] and VP(+)[ ] barked VP [ ] Instead of a typical transition for 'gnawed' of VP -+ NP, we have a transition introducing a coordinated VP: VP -4 NP [VP(+)] In general for any transition X -4 Y , where X is a category and Y a list of categories (possibly empty), there will be a transition introducing coordination: X -4 Y IX(+)] Non-constituent coordinations such as (7) present serious problems for phrase-structure approaches: (7) Fido had a bone yesterday and biscuit today.

For example, factoring out items on the stack, as in (1), removes from the model the disinclination for long states inherent in the original corpus. To recapture this discarded aspect of the language, it would be sufficient to introduce into the model a probabilistic penalty based on state length. This penalty may easily be calculated according to the lengths of states in the parsed corpus. Not only would this allow the modelling of the restriction on centre-embedding, but it would also allow many other \"processing\" phenomena to be accurately characterized.
