The conference programme features invited talks, tutorials and submitted papers in the main session and in the student session. The Programme Committee for the main session received a large number of submissions from all over the world. The general quality of the submissions was high. Out of a total of 153 submissions for the main session, 36 were accepted. Almost without exception, each paper was reviewed by three referees. We trust that the resulting programme offers an inspiring and representative sample of current research in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of the field. Due to the volume of submissions, the reviewing process was both time-consuming and difficult. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the program committee for taking on an average of 27 reviews and, in many cases, for contributing their own travel funds to attend the meeting of the program committee held at the University of Tfibingen: Harry Bunt, Tilburg University Jan van Eijck, CWI, Amsterdam Eva Ejerhed, University of Umea Dale Gerdemann, University of Tiibingen Jan Hajic, Universita Karlova, Prague Julia Hirschberg, AT~4T Bell Laboratories, Ed Hovy, USC Information Sciences Institute Judith Klavans, Columbia University Lori Lamel, LIMSI CNRS Mark Liberman, University of Pennsylvania Tsuneko Nakazawa, NTT Laboratories Philip Resnik, Sun Microsystems Labs William Rounds, CWI and Univ. of Michigan Louisa Sadler, University of Essex Harold Somers, UMIST, Manchester Oliviero Stock, IRST, Trento Henry Thompson, IRCS and Edinburgh Harald Trost, Univ. of Vienna Annie Zaenen, Rank Xerox Research, Meylan We would also like to thank those colleagues who helped with the reviewing process at the request of members of the program committee. Many people contributed to the preparations of this meeting, and we are extremely grateful to them: Patrick Hanks, Stuart Shieber and Wolfgang Wahlster for the invited talks; Martin Kay, Shalom Lappin, and Alan Smeaton for giving tutorials; John Nerbonne for organising the tutorials; all ACL and EACL officials, for replying promptly to our frequent appeals for advice; Paul Jacobs and Steven Krauwer for providing reusable resources from previous ACL-affiliated meetings; Thorsten Brants for organising the student sessions. The student session is described in more detail in a separate preface (p. iv). Special thanks are due to Allan Ramsay and his assistants in Dublin for the preparation of these proceedings and for handling the local organisation of the meeting. Local help in Tfibingen with preparing the papers for the committee and with mailings came from Iris Haberbosch, Katerina Magdou and Stephanie Schwarz. The meeting in Dublin is the first (E)ACL conference which offers support for students from the Don and Betty Walker International Student Fund to help defray costs for attending the meeting. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all contributors to the fund for their generous help. Your contributions are a tribute to the inspiration that the field of computational linguistics has received from the many years of dedication by Betty Walker and the late Don Walker. We dedicate these Proceedings to Betty and Don Walker. Steven P. Abney and Erhard W.

This part of the conference differs fl'om the main conference in its emphasis on promising work in progress and provides an opportunity for student researchers to receive valuable feedback on their work from other members of the computational linguistics community. We received 37 submissions for this student session, eight of which were accepted; one submission was accepted as a reserve paper. We allowed electronic submissions for the student session, and most of the authors (35 of 37) submitted electronically. Except for some minor formatting problems the committee had very good experiences with electronic reviewing and electronic-discussion. We would like to thank the authors for their submissions. An equally important contribution was made by the student programme committee. Every paper was read by at least three of the 20 committee members. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to make a well-informed decision about which papers to select. Also we would like to thank the organizers of the main conference, who supported us with their advice throughout the preparations of the session. We welcome their decision to enlarge the student part from six to eight papers, which still left a strong competition between the authors.

It shows in detail how this framework applies to ordered sets of context-sensitive rewriting rules and also to grammars in Koskenniemi's two-level formalism. This analysis provides a common representation of phonological constraints that supports efficient generation and recognition by a single interpreter.","Recommended Reading: RONALD M. KAPLAN AND MARTIN KAY, \"Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems,\" Computational Linguistics 20(3), 1994, 331-378.","9:30-12:30 Alan Smeaton, Dublin City University Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval The tutorial is aimed at an NLP audience v~ho want to find about a possible application area for NLP resources and techniques ... information retrieval.","What is information retrieval ... functionality, including document retrieval, filtering, and routing ... application areas, present and perceived. Conventional approaches to IR ... it is essential to see what other techniques have been used in IR to appreciate where NLP can/cannot be of use .... indexing techniques, boolean retrieval, vector space model, probabilistic modelling, term weighting and relevance feedback, query expansion, ranking. Storage structures ... this will be very short, just touching on the engineering problems of managing gigabytes of text.","Three sections cover the guts of the NLP-IR intersection and will be peppered with illustrative examples.","• Lexical resources/morphology in indexing by word senses, base forms, grammatical categories, stemming.","• Syntax in indexing and matching, phrase identification and extraction, phrase normalisation and matching","• Semantics in indexing and matching ... KR formalisms, examples of systems/prototypes which use higher-order NLP Issues of scale ... examples and illustrations of NLP-based IR (IR using NLP tools, techniques or resources) working on large scale collections, examples from TREC.","Research issues and trends ... this section will be a discussion, led by me, on what I perceive as the directions in which the IR-NLP intersection will head.","2:00-5:00 Shalom Lappin, School for Oriental and African Languages, University of London Computational Approaches to Ellipsis The sentences in 1 illustrate three types of incomplete structures. la. John read the paper before Bill did. b. Max gave flowers to Lucy, and chocolates too. c. No student arrived, except John. la is an instance of VP ellipsis, lb is a case of \"bare argument ellipsis\"; and lc contains an exception phrase fragment. I will consider two possible approaches to developing a unified procedure for interpreting these distinct kinds of incomplete constituents. The first involves generating the semantic representation of an appropriate property or relation for the elided constituent fragment. The second attempts to reconstruct a syntactic representation of a VP or sentence containing the fragment. I will consider each approach in some detail, and argue that neither the semantic nor the syntactic view can handle all three types of incomplete constituent.","I will provide motivation for the claim that VP ellipsis requires syntactic reconstruction, and that it is, in fact, a species of pseudo-gapping illustrated in 2. 2. John gave flowers to Lucy before he did chocolates to Rosa. On this view, reconstruction is a relation between an elided VP and an equivalence class of lexically anchored syntactic structures which correspond to an antecedent VP. All elements of the equivalence class exhibit the same syntactic structure, but variation among corresponding lexical anchors with respect to a restricted set of specified features is possible. The syntactic structure of a (perhaps partially) elided VP is reconstructed by identifying its elided head with the head of an antecedent VP, and then specifying a correspondence among the arguments and adjuncts of the antecedent head on one hand and those of the elided head on the other. I discuss the algorithm for VP ellipsis resolution presented in Lappin and McCord (1990) and extended in McCord et at. as an implementation of this analysis.","I argue that, contrary to VP ellipsis, bare argument ellipsis must be resolved by means of a semantic procedure for predicate generation. I consider the higher-order unification analysis proposed in Dalrymple et al. (1991) as a possible account of this procedure.","Finally, I present arguments for treating an exception phrase fragment not as an instance of ellipsis, but as a displaced NP modifier. NP storage (Cooper (1993), Pereira (1990), and Pereira and Pollock (1991)) provides a suitable device for expressing the connection between a displaced exceptior~ phrase and the NP which it modifies.","The study of these three types of incomplete constituents indicates that the interpretation of ellipsis and constituent fragments is not a unified process. Each fragment type requires a different reconstruction procedure which operates at a distinct level of representation."]},{"title":"Background Reading:","paragraphs":["DALRYMPLE, M., S.
