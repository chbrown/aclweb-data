Chunking concentrates on constructs that can be recognized with a high degree of certainty. For several applications, this type of information with high accuracy is more valuable than deep analysis with lower accuracy.","We will present a new approach to partial parsing that uses Markov Models. The presented models are extensions of the part-of-speech tagging technique and are capable of emitting structure. They utilize context-free grammar rules and add left-to-right transitional context information. This type of model is used to facilitate the syntactic annotation of the NEGRA corpus of German newspaper texts (Skut et al., 1997).","Part-of-speech tagging is the assignment of syntactic categories (tags) to words that occur in the processed text. Among others, this task is efficiently solved with Markov Models. States of a Markov Model represent syntactic categories (or tuples of syntactic categories), and outputs represent words and punctuation (Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988, and others). This technique of statistical part-of-speech tagging operates very successfully, and usually accuracy rates between 96 and 97% are reported for new, unseen text.","Brants et al.

The terminal sequence is complemented by tags (Stuttgart-Tiibingen-Tagset, Thielen and Schiller, 1995). Non-terminal nodes are labeled with phrase categories, edges are labeled with grammatical functions (NEGRA tagset).","In this paper, we will show that Markov Models are not restricted to the labeling task (i.e., the assignment of part-of-speech labels, phrase labels, or labels for grammatical functions), but are also capable of generating structural elements. We will use cascades of Markov Models. Starting with the part-of-speech layer, each layer of the resulting structure is represented by its own Markov Model. A lower layer passes its output as input to the next higher layer. The output of a layer can be ambiguous and it is complemented by a probability distribution for the alternatives.","This type of parsing is inspired by finite state cascades which are presented by several authors.","CASS (Abney, 1991; Abney, 1996) is a partial parser that recognizes non-recursive basic phrases (chunks) with finite state transducers. Each transducer emits a single best analysis (a longest match) that serves as input for the transducer at the next higher level. CASS needs a special grammar for which rules are manually coded. Each layer creates a particular subset of phrase types. FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1993) is heavily based on pattern matching. Each pattern is associated with one or more trigger words. It uses a series of non-deterministic finite-state transducers to build chunks; the output of one transducer is passed 118 Proceedings of EACL '99"]},{"title":",D","paragraphs":[",] an Arbeit und Gelci APPR NN KON NN of work and money Ein enormer Posten wird von den 37 beteiligten Vereinen aufgebracht ART ADJA NN VAFIN APPR ART CARD ADJA NN WPP An enormous amount is by the 37 involved organizations raised 'A large amount of money and work was raised by the involved organizations' Figure 1: Example sentence and annotation.

(Roche, 1994) uses the fix point of a finite-state transducer. The transducer is iteratively applied to its own output until it remains identical to the input. The method is successfully used for efficient processing with large grammars. (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) present an approach to chunking based on a mixture of finite state and context-free techniques. They use N P rules of a pruned treebank grammar. For processing, each point of a text is matched against the treebank rules and the longest match is chosen. Cascades of automata and transducers can also be found in speech processing, see e.g. (Pereira et al., 1994; Mohri, 1997).","Contrary to finite-state transducers, Cascaded Markov Models exploit probabilities when processing layers of a syntactic structure. They do not generate longest matches but most-probable sequences. Furthermore, a higher layer sees different alternatives and their probabilities for the same span. It can choose a lower ranked alternative if it fits better into the context of the higher layer. An additional advantage is that Cascaded Markov Models do not need a \"stratified\" grammar (i.e., each layer encodes a disjoint subset of phrases). Instead the system can be immediately trained on existing treebank data.","The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 addresses the encoding of parsing processes as Markov Models.

Contextual probabilities of tags are encoded as transition probabilities of tags, and lexical probabilities of the Markov Model are encoded as output probabilities of words in states.","We introduce a modification to this encoding. States additionally may represent non-terminal categories (phrases). These new states emit partial parse trees (cf. figure 2). This can be seen as collapsing a sequence of terminals into one non-terminal. Transitions into and out of the new states are performed in the same way as for words and parts-of-speech.","Transitional probabilities for this new type of Markov Models can be estimated from annotated data in a way very similar to estimating probabilities for a part-of-speech tagger.

For each layer, a Markov Model determines the best set of phrases. These phrases are used as input for the next layer, which adds one more layer. Phrase hypotheses at each layer are generated according to stochastic context-free grammar rules (the outputs of the Markov Model) and subsequently filtered from left to right by Markov Models.","Figure 3 gives an overview of the parsing model. Starting with part-of-speech tagging, new phrases are created at higher layers and filtered by Markov Models operating from left to right. 3.1 Tagging Lattices The processing example in figure 3 only shows the best hypothesis at each layer. But there are alternative phrase hypotheses and we need to determine the best one during the parsing process.","All rules of the generated context-free grammar with right sides that are compatible with part of the sequence are added to the search space. Figure 4 shows an example for hypotheses at the first layer when processing the sentence of figure 1. Each bar represents one hypothesis. The position of the bar indicates the covered words. It is labeled with the type of the hypothetical phrase, an index in the upper left corner for later reference, the negative logarithm of the probability that this phrase generates the terminal yield (i.e., the smaller the better; probabilities for part-of-speech tags are omitted for clarity). This part is very similar to chart entries of a chart parser.","All phrases that are newly introduced at this layer are marked with an asterisk (*). They are produced according to context-free rules, based on the elements passed from the next lower layer. The layer below layer 1 is the part-of-speech layer.","The hypotheses form a lattice, with the word boundaries being states and the phrases being edges. Selecting the best hypothesis means to find the best path from node 0 to the last node (node 14 in the example). The best path can be efficiently found with the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967), which runs in time linear to the length of the word sequence. Having this view of finding the best hypothesis, processing of a layer is similar to word lattice processing in speech recognition (cf. Samuelsson, 1997).","Two types of probabilities are important when searching for the best path in a lattice. First, these are probabilities of the hypotheses (phrases) generating the underlying terminal nodes (words). They are calculated according to a stochastic context-free grammar and given in figure 4. The second type are context probabilities, i.e., the probability that some type of phrase follows or precedes another. The two types of probabilities coincide with lexical and contextual probabilities of a Markov Model, respectively.","According to a trigram model (generated from a corpus), the path in figure 4 that is marked grey is the best path in the lattice.

The probability of a connected structure is determined only based on a stochastic context-free grammar. The joint probabilities of unconnected partial structures are determined by additionally using Markov Models. While building the structure bottom up, parses that are unlikely according to the Markov Models are pruned. 3.2 The Method The standard Viterbi algorithm is modified in order to process Markov Models operating on lattices. In part-of-speech tagging, each hypothesis (a tag) spans exactly one word. Now, a hypothesis can span an arbitrary number of words, and the same span can be covered by an arbitrary number of alternative word or phrase hypotheses. Using terms of a Markov Model, a state is allowed to emit a context-free partial parse tree, starting with the represented non-terminal symbol, yield-ing part of the sequence of words. This is in contrast to standard Markov Models. There, states emit atomic symbols. Note that an edge in the lattice is represented by a state in the corresponding Markov Model. Figure 2 shows the part of the Markov Model that represents the best path in the lattice of figure 4.","The equations of the Viterbi algorithm are adapted to process a language model operating on a lattice. Instead of the words, the gaps between the words are enumerated (see figure 4), and an edge between two states can span one or more words, such that an edge is represented by a triple <t, t', q>, starting at time t, ending at time t' and representing state q.","We introduce accumulators At,t, (q) that collect the maximum probability of state q covering words from position t to t '.

But generally, Cascaded Markov Models can be reduced to generating just one layer and can be trained on Penn Treebank data. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a new parsing model for shallow processing. The model parses by representing each layer of the resulting structure as a separate Markov Model. States represent categories of words and phrases, outputs consist of partial parse trees. Starting with the layer for part-of-speech tags, the output of lower layers is passed as input to higher layers. This type of model is restricted to a fixed maximum number of layers in the parsed structure, since the number of Markov Models is determined before parsing. While the effects of these restrictions on the parsing of sentences and VPs are still to be investigated, we obtain excellent results for the chunking task, i.e., the recognition of kernel NPs and PPs.","It will be interesting to see in future work if Cascaded Markov Models can be extended to parsing sentences and VPs. The average number of layers per sentence in the NEGRA corpus is only 5; 99.9% of all sentences have 10 or less layers, thus a very limited number of Markov Models would be sufficient.","Cascaded Markov Models add left-to-right context-information to context-free parsing. This contextualization is orthogonal to another important trend in language processing: lexicalization. We expect that the combination of these techniques results in improved models.","We presented the generation of parameters from annotated corpora and used linear interpolation for smoothing. While we do not expect ira-124 Proceedings of EACL '99 provements by re-estimation on raw data, other smoothing methods may result in better accuracies, e.g. the maximum entropy framework. Yet, the high complexity of maximum entropy parameter estimation requires careful pre-selection of relevant linguistic features.","The presented Markov Models act as filters. The probability of the resulting structure is determined only based on a stochastic context-free grammar. While building the structure bottom up, parses that are unlikely according to the Markov Models are pruned. We think that a combined probability measure would improve the model. For this, a mathematically motivated combination needs to be determined.
