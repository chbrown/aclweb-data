Biber's (1988) methodology is used to obtain both the characterisation of style of our corpus and the division of the corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts. These sets will be used for studying the architectural aspects."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We started our research with a survey of 19 applied natural language generation (NLG) systems (Paiva, 1998) and noticed that:","• almost all the systems followed a pipeline","model;","• there was a general agreement on the core","NLG tasks that a system should perform","(e.g., aggregation, lexicalisation, etc.);","• the surveyed systems mainly differed on","the order the NLG tasks are executed (see","Cahill et al., 1999);","We also noticed that the texts produced by the various systems were apparently quite different stylistically (although we did not have a formal method to measure how much different they were) and, in order to explain how this variety of texts was obtained with the same type of architecture (i.e., pipeline), we have put forward the hypothesis that the order in which the NLG tasks are executed influences the kind of text that can be obtained, i.e. a certain order would facilitate the generation of a certain type of text whilst another would not.","This hypothesis goes in line with other researchers' results which purport to show that architectural aspects of a NLG system depend on the characteristics of the text to be generated and vice versa. For instance: 237 • Robin (1994) argues for a revision-","incremental architecture for the generation","of structurally complex text with floating","content -- i.e., content that can appear","anywhere in the text and is opportunisti-","cally realised only if stylistic factors of the","surrounding text allow; • Inui and colleagues (1992) conclude that","in order to avoid the generation of text","with ambiguous and complex sentences a","revision architecture is necessary, with the","revision module placed at the end of the","generation process (i.e., after the linguistic","realisation)l; • Reiter (ms.) reports that pipeline architec-","tures cannot deal with constraints on the","length of a text. It is difficult however to reconcile their results","in a unified perspective since each of these re-","ported works started with a different perspective","and, generally, had different aims in mind. We believe that it is possible to relate those","characteristics of text presented above (such as","complexity, ambiguity and sentence length) 2 to","style, 3 and that we can gain insight into NLG ar-","chitectures having a systematic way to classify","texts by their stylistic properties so that we can","analyse the architectural aspects in relation to","this stylistic classification. We then start with the point of view that it is","reasonable to assume that certain styles of text","demand a more specialised type of architecture","than others (for example, a revision versus a pipeline architecture 4) and our idea is to develop a methodology for studying which are the appro-Some aspects related to the complexity of a sentence (e.g., sentence length) can only be measured precisely when the text has already been generated. 2 For instance, complexity and (lack of) ambiguity are factors that can be related to the 'clarity\" of a text. 3 Depending on the definition we assume for it. 4 For a classification of NLG architectures, see (De Smedt et al., 1996) Proceedings of EACL '99 FORMALITY ~ENESS INTERACINENESS \"7\""]},{"title":"i text type 2 ~ text type 3 text type 1 _ -r","paragraphs":["A B In this figure, one group expresses texts that are formal, concise, and not interactive (text type 1 -- a possible example is news columns in scientific maga2ines).

Secondly, we need to find a way to group stylistically-similar texts into sets so that we can study the architec-5 \"The specific pragmatic [and stylistic] features used by PAULINE are but a first step.

For the first part, there are two approaches in the literature linking stylistic parameters to characteristics of texts. We have already cited Hovy (1988) and its main problem: the lack of formal-ity. DiMarco's (1990) approach was to construct a 'stylistic grammar' using the notion of norm and deviation from norm (see, e.g., Enkvist (1973)). While this approach is enough to obtain the stylistic parameters 6, we think that this characterisation brings a problem for grouping texts into sets -- it can create only two sets for studying: the texts that agree with the norm and those that do not. This can be a problem because, although the texts following the norm will comprise a set of similar texts, those in the 'deviant' set can be so dissimilar that any type of analysis based on them (and, consequently, its interpretation in architectural terms) is probably doomed to failure.","In our approach we will avoid these problems by following a methodology that can provide two things: (1) a characterisation of the stylistic parameters of a corpus 7, and (2) a partition of a corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts. We are working with Biber's (1988) methodology. From a corpus tagged with a comprehensive set of linguistic features of English, we obtain the frequency count associated with each one) Using a statistical factor analysis, we group the linguistic features that co-occur, considering each group 6 DiMarco refers to them as 'stylistic goals'. 7 Our corpus comprises texts written for two different audiences (patients and doctors) of more than 250 pharmaceutical products -- in total it is more than 500 texts. s There are two levels of tagging. First, the corpus is tagged using Brill's (1994) tagger. Secondly, programs for counting specific configurations of tags are run. The process is completely automatic.

In order to obtain the text types, a cluster analysis is used and results in the partitioning of the corpus (i.e., the texts with similar values for all the stylistic parameters will be grouped in a partition (see Figure I-B)). Following this procedure will allow us to analyse aspects of architecture for each text type (i.e., each partition) in isolation and, more importantly, make cross-comparisons among these analyses."]},{"title":"3 Relating Style to Architecture","paragraphs":["We are using NLG tasks as the basis for our approach to relate style to NIX3 architectures. We are working with a set of core NLG task that we have found to be stable: all of them occurred in almost all the systems we surveyed (Paiva, 1998). The set comprises the following tasks: content determination, rhetorical structuring, lexicalisation, intra and inter-sentential ordering, referring expression generation, aggregation, segmentation, and linguistic realisation (for an explanation about those task, see Cahill et al., 1999). ~l","Part of the process for relating style to architecture is depicted in Figure 2. As shown, we start by analysing the NLG tasks that are responsible for the presence of a specific linguistic feature (arrow B). The association of stylistic parameters with linguistic features obtained in the corpus analysis (arrow A) will be used to observe which NLG tasks are responsible for 9 Biber refers to this as a 'dimension of register variation'. raThe assumption is that strong co-occurrence patterns of linguistic features mark underlying functional dimensions (Biber, 1988; p. 13). Notice that the name of each stylistic parameter, per se, means nothing; it is the linguistic features grouped in each stylistic parameter that are important! Nonetheless, it is easier to refer to a stylistic parameter by its name than to the set of linguistic features it represents. So below we say that a certain text is formal, when, in fact, we want to say that it has certain linguistic features such as passives, formal words, conjuncts, etc. ~ We are aware that some of those tasks can be subdivided and that some authors assume different names for2l~ same task. If necessary, we will do extensions to this set. specific values of a stylistic parameter (arrow C). 12 Then we will observe the combinations of the NLG tasks in accordance with each text type (partition) obtained in the corpus analysis. This will give us an idea of which NLG tasks are most responsible for (the linguistic features associated with) the different text types; also, it will show us how the tasks are working (because of the links to the linguistic features (see Figure 2)). The result of this process will be sets of NLG tasks for each text type. • )/ • Eg.: • conjuncls (~g., \"hoMeveC','in com~=~, \"~ ~=amp~, ...)

Our work then will be to observe the NLG tasks (inside each text type first, but making cross-comparisons among text types afterwards) at-tacking the questions related to architecture, i.e., 'which kind of modularisation and interaction between modules is necessary/appropriate', 'which resources are used', 'what kind of data the modules/tasks exchange', etc.","We will investigate architectural decisions at three different levels:","• at the task level: how can a certain task be made sensitive to values of stylistic parameters?","• at the level of tasks interaction: is there a natural ordering of tasks for a certain type of text? 13","• at the global level: assuming that tasks are normally encapsulated inside modules, what characteristics of texts force the interaction between modules to be more in-tense? ~2The statistical method by which arrow A in Figure 2 is derived gives a measure of how important the linguistic feature is for a certain stylistic parameter. ~SSee Danlos (1984) for examples of how the order of execution of tasks can favour a certain textual result over another. Proceedings of EACL '99","Faced with this classification we will propose solutions that can be used in the specification of an architecture that supports the generation of texts in different styles. We expect these solutions to lead to useful guidelines for helping designers of NLG systems to choose the appropriate architecture for the type of text they want their system to generate. 4 Discussion One may question why we are repeating Biber's experiment, when he has already obtained a set of stylistic parameters and a set of text types. It is possible that other results emerge from applying his methodology to our corpus, and the only way to know this will be by re-doing the analysis. It is also possible that we obtain a subset of his results, which will at least make our task a more manageable one.","We believe that our result will be of general utility. Although the precise set of stylistic parameters may be dependent on the corpus one is using, we expect that the set of valid task interaction patterns will be restricted, and that the text types emerging from our study will encompass most of the valid patterns. Our programs for counting the linguistic features will be made available for others to use. 5 Conclusion In this paper we propose a methodology for investigating the relationship between architectures of NLG systems and stylistic properties of the texts they can generate. Although we are still undertaking the first steps of our methodology (the corpus analysis), we believe that this methodology will allow us to test the hypothesis regarding the order of execution of NLG tasks, and at least provide initial indicators on the relationship between classes of architectures and the style of generated texts. 6 Acknowledgements I would like to thanks Donia Scott, Roger Evans, Richard Power, Kees van Deemter, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments on this paper.","7 References","Biber, D.
