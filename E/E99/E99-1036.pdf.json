We exploit island representations and a new level of granularity for the linearization of a tree called connected routes. It allows to take into account the topology of the tree in order to trigger additional rules. These local rules cover ellipsis and common extra-grammatical phenomena such as self-repairs. First results with a spoken language corpora are presented."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["In the context of spoken task-oriented manmachine and question-answering dialogues, one of the most important problem is to deal with spontaneous and unexpected syntactical phenomena. Utterances can be very incomplete and difficult to predict which questions the principle of grammaticality. Moreover large covering grammars are generally dedicated to written text parsing and it is not easy to exploit such a grammar for the analysis of spoken language even if complex syntax does not occur.","For such sentences, robust parsing techniques are necessary to extract a maximum of information from the utterance even if a Complete parsing fails (at least all possible constituents). Considering parsing of word-graphs and the large search space of parsing algorithms in order to compute all possible ambiguities, the number of partial parses can be very important. A robust semantic processing on these partial derivations would result in a prohibitive number of hypotheses. We argue in this paper that appropriate syntactical constraints expressed in a Lexicalized Tree Grammar (LTG) can trigger efficient repair rules for specific oral phenomena.","First results of a classical grammatical parsing are presented, they show that robust parsing need to cope with oral phenomena. We argue then that extended domain of locality and lexicalization of LTG can be exploited in order to express repair local rules for these specific spoken phenomena. First results of this approach are presented."]},{"title":"1 LTG parsing and repairing strategy","paragraphs":["1.1 Experimental results Table 1 presents parsing test results of the Gocad corpora. This corpora contains 861 utterances in French of transcribed spontaneous spoken language collected with a Wizard of Oz experiment (Chapelier et al., 1995). We used a bottom-up parser (Lopez, 1998b) for LTAG. The size of the grammar was limited compared with (Candito, 1999) and corresponds to the sublanguage used in the Gocad application. However designing principles of the grammar was close to the large covering French LTAG grammar just including additional elementary trees (for example for unexpected adverbs which can modify predicative nouns) and a notation enrichment for the possible ellipsis occurrences (Lopez, 1998a). The LTAG grammar for the sublanguage corresponds to a syntactical lexicon of 529 entries and a set of 80 non-instancied elementary trees.","A taxonomy of parsing errors occurring in oral dialogue shows that the majority of failures are linked to orality: hesitations, repetitions, self repairs and some head ellipsis. The table 2 gives the occurrence of these oral phenomena in the Gocad corpora. Of course more than one phenomenon can occur in the same utterance.","Prediction of these spoken phenomena would result in a very high parsing cost. However if we can detect these oral phenomena with additional techniques combining partial results, the number of hypotheses at the semantic level will decrease. 249 Proceedings of EACL '99 Corpus % complete"]},{"title":"]","paragraphs":["Average no parses , of parses/utter."]},{"title":"Cocad II 78.3 II 2.o","paragraphs":["Average no of","partial results/utter.","7.1 Table 1: Global results for the parsing of the Gocad corpora utterances ill-formed with with with I agrammatical utterances hesitations repetitions self-repairs [ ellipsis Occurrences"]},{"title":"II","paragraphs":["123"]},{"title":"II","paragraphs":["28 22"]},{"title":"II 15","paragraphs":["Table 2: Occurrences of error oral phenomena in the Gocad corpora","1.2 Exploiting Lexicalized Tree Grammars The choice of a LTG (Lexicalized Tree Grammar), more specifically a LTAG (Lexicalized Tree Adjo-ing Grammar), can be justified by the two main following reasons: first the lexicalization and the extended domain of locality allow to express easily lexical constraints in partial parsing trees (elementary trees), secondly robust bottom-up parsing algorithms, stochastic models and efficient precompilation of the grammar (Evans and Weir, 1998) exist for LTG.","When the parsing of an utterance fails, a robust bottom-up algorithm gives partial derived and derivation trees. With a classical chart parsing, items are obtained from other items and correspond to a well-recognized chunk of the utterance. The chart is an acyclic graph representing all the derivations. A partial result corresponds to the maximal expansion of an island, so to an item which is not the origin of any other item.","The main difference between a Context Free Grammar and a Lexicalized Tree Grammar is that a tree directly encodes for a specific anchor a partial parsing tree. This representation is richer than a set of Context Free rules. We argue that we can exploit this feature by triggering rules not only according to the category of the node N corresponding to an item but considering some nodes near N.","2 Island representation and connected routes in repair local rules 2.1 Finite States Automata","representation of an elementary tree The linearization of a tree can be represented with a Finite State Automaton (FSA) as in figure 2. Every tree traversal (left-to-right, bidirectional from an anchor, ...) can be performed on this automaton. Doted trees used for example in (Schabes, 1994) are equivalent to the states of these automata. It is then possible to share all the FSA of a lexicalized grammar in a single one with techniques presented in (Evans and Weir, 1998)."]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["S <> S N$ V <> V S Figure 2: Simple FSA representing an elementary tree for the normal form of French intransive verb.","We consider the following definitions and notations : Each automaton transition is annotated with a category of node.

Connected route is an intermediate level of granularity when representing a linearized tree: each elementary (or a derived tree) can be represented as a list of connected routes. Considering connected routes during the parsing permits to take into account the topology of the elementary trees and to locate significative nodes for an attachment (Loper, 1998b).

We use a two stage strategy (Ros@ and Lavie, 1997) corresponding to two sets of rules: the first one is the set for a bottom-up parsing of LTAG using FSA and connected routes (Lopez, 1998b), the second one gathers the repair rules presented in this paper. This strategy separates parsing of grammatical utterances (resulting from substitution and adjunction) from the parsing of admitted utterances (performed by the additional set). This kind of strategy permits to keep a normal parsing complexity when the utterance is grammatical.
