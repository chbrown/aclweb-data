It is based on the complementary use of two tools: (1) a Term Extraction tool that acquires term candidates from tagged corpora through a shallow grammar of noun phrases, and (2) a Term Clustering tool that groups syntactic variants (insertions). Experiments performed on corpora in three technical domains yield clusters of term candidates with precision rates between 93% and 98%. 1 Computational Terminology In the domain of corpus-based terminology two types of tools are currently developed: tools for automatic term extraction (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996; Brun, 1998) and tools for automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette, 1994). These tools are expected to be complementary in the sense that the links and clusters proposed in automatic thesaurus construction can be exploited for structuring the term candidates produced by the automatic term extractors. In fact, complementarity is difficult because term extractors provide mainly multi-word terms, while tools for automatic thesaurus construction yield clusters of single-word terms.","On the one hand, term extractors focus on multi-word terms for ontological motivations: single-word terms are too polysemous and too generic and it is therefore necessary to provide the user with multi-word terms that represent finer concepts in a domain. The counterpart of this focus is that automatic term extractors yield important volumes of data that require structuring through a postprocessor. On the other hand, tools for automatic thesaurus construction focus on single-word terms for practical reasons. Since they cluster terms through statistical measures of context similarities, these tools exploit recurring situations. Since single-word terms denote broader concepts than multi-word terms, they appear more frequently in corpora and are therefore more appropriate for statistical clustering.","The contribution of this paper is to propose an integrated platform for computer-aided term extraction and structuring that results from the combination of"]},{"title":"LEXTER,","paragraphs":["a Term Extraction tool (Bouriganlt et al., 1996), and"]},{"title":"FASTR 1,","paragraphs":["a Term Normalization tool (Jacquemin et al., 1997)."]},{"title":"2 Components of the Platform for Computer-Aided Terminology","paragraphs":["The platform for computer-aided terminology is organized as a chain of four modules and the corresponding flowchart is given by Figure 1.

This task is basically performed by FASTR, a term normalizer, that has been adapted to the task at hand.","~F-:!etion The last step of thesaurus construction is the validation of automatically extracted clusters of term candidates by a terminologist and a domain expert. The validation is performed through a data-base interface. The links are automatically updated through the entire base and a structured thesaurus is progressively constructed.","The following sections provide more details about the components and evaluate the quality of the terms thus extracted. 3 Term Extraction 3.1 Term Extraction for the French"]},{"title":"Language","paragraphs":["Term extraction tools perform statistical or/and syntactical analysis of text corpora in specialized technical or scientific domains. Term candidates correspond to sequences of words (most of the time noun phrases) that are likely to be terminological units. These candidates are ultimately validated as entries by a terminologist in charge of building a thesaurus. LEXTER, the term extractor, is applied to the French language. Since French is a Romance language, the syntactic structure of terms and compounds is very similar to the structure of non-compound and non-terminological noun phrases. For instance, in French, terms can contain prepositional phrases with determiners such as: paroiNoun"]},{"title":"deprep /'Det","paragraphs":["uret~reNoun (ureteral wall). Because of this similarity, the detection of terms and their variants in French is more difficult than in the English language.","The input of our term extraction tool is an unambiguously tagged corpus. The extraction process is composed of two main steps: Splitting and Parsing. 3.2 Splitting The techniques of shallow parsing implemented in the Splitting module detect morpho-syntactical patterns that cannot be parts of terminological noun phrases and that are therefore likely to in-dicate noun phrases boundaries. Splitting techniques are used in other shallow parsers such as (Grefenstette, 1992). In the case of LEXTER, the noun phrases which are isolated by splitting are not intermediary data; they are not used by any other automatic module in order to index or classify documents. The extracted noun phrases are term candidates which are proposed to the user. In such a situation, splitting must be performed with high precision.","In order to process correctly some problematic splittings, such as coordinations, attributive past participles and sequences preposition + determiner, the system acquires and uses corpus-based selection restrictions of adjectives and nouns (Bourigault et al., 1996).","For example, in order to disambiguate PPattachments, the system possesses a corpus-based list of adjectives which accept a prepositional argument built with the preposition h (at). These selectional restrictions are acquired through Corpus-Based Endogenous Learning (CBEL) as follows: During a first pass, all the adjectives in a predicative position followed by the preposition h are collected. During a second pass, each time a splitting rule has eliminated a sequence beginning with the preposition el, the preceding adjective is discarded from the list. Empirical analyses confirm the validity of this procedure. More complex procedures of CBEL are implemented into LEXTER in order to acquire nouns sub-categorizing the preposition h or the preposition sur (on), adjectives sub-categorizing the preposition de (of), past participles sub-categorizing the preposition de (of), etc.","Ultimately, the Splitting module produces a set of text sequences, mostly noun phrases, which we 16 Proceedings of EACL '99 refer to as Maximal-Length Noun Phrases (henceforth MLNP). 3.3 Parsing The Parsing module recursively decomposes the maximal-length noun phrases into two syntactic constituents: a constituent in head-position (e.g."]},{"title":"bronchial cell","paragraphs":["in the noun phrase"]},{"title":"cylindrical bronchial cell,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"cell","paragraphs":["in the noun phrase"]},{"title":"bronchial cell),","paragraphs":["and a constituent in expansion position (e.g."]},{"title":"cylindrical","paragraphs":["in the noun phrase"]},{"title":"cylindrical bronchial cell,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"bronchial","paragraphs":["in the noun phrase"]},{"title":"bronchial cell).","paragraphs":["The Parsing module exploits rules in order to extract two subgroups from each MLNP, one in head-position and the other one in expansion position. Most of MLNP sequences are ambiguous. Two (or more) binary decompositions compete, corresponding to several possibilities of prepositional phrase or adjective attachment. The disambiguation is performed by a corpus-based method which relies on endogenous learning procedures (Bouriganlt, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1998). An example of such a procedure is given in Figure 2. 3.4 Network of term candidates The sub-groups generated by the Parsing module, together with the maximal-length noun phrases extracted by the Splitting module, are the term candidates produced by the Term extraction tool. This set of term candidates is represented as a network: each multi-word term candidate is connected to its head constituent and to its expansion constituent by syntactic decomposition links. An excerpt of a network of term candidates is given in Figure 3. Vertical and horizontal links are syntactic decomposition links produced by the Term Extraction tool. The oblique link is a syntactic variation link added by the Term Clustering tool.","The building of the network is especially important for the purpose of term acquisition. The average number of multi-word term candidates is 8,000 for a 100,000 word corpus. The feedback of several experiments in which our Term Extraction tool was used shows that the more structured the set of term candidates is, the more efficiently the validation task is performed. For example, the structuring through syntactic decomposition allows the system to underscore lists of terms that share the same term either in head position or in expansion position. Such paradigmatic series are frequent in term banks, and initiating the validation task by analyzing such lists appears to be a very efficient validation strategy.","This paper proposes a novel technique for enriching the network of term candidates through"]},{"title":"cell","paragraphs":["N 3 \"0 bronchial"]},{"title":"cell","paragraphs":["1 A2N 3 l"]},{"title":"[ Expansion link ~ l cylindrical bronchial cell cylindrical cell - I","paragraphs":["AIN 3"]},{"title":"Expansion link bronchial","paragraphs":["A2 I::>- cyfi~cal"]},{"title":"At 1:>.-","paragraphs":["Figure 3: Excerpt of a network of term candidates. the addition of syntactic variation links to syntactic decomposition links. 4 Term Clustering 4.1 Adapting a Normalization Tool Term normalization is a procedure used in automatic indexing for conflating various term occurrences into unique canonical forms.

This approach has however never been applied to large scale term extraction because it is based on a full semantic analysis of sentences. Our approach is more realistic because it does not involve large-scale knowledge-intensive interpretation of texts that is known to be unrealistic.","Our approach to the clustering of term can-17 Proceedings of EACL '99","Parsing rule","Noun1 Prep Noun2 Adj -~ Parse (1) Head: Noum Exp.: Nouns Adj","Head: Nouns","Exp.: Adj Parse (2) Head: Noun1 Prep Nouns","Head: Noun1","Exp.: Nouns Exp.: Adj","Disambiguation procedure:","Look in the corpus for non ambiguous occurrences of the sub-groups: (a) Noun2 Adj (b) Noun1 Adj (c) Noun1 Prep Noun2","Then choose: if the sub-group (a) has been found, then choose Parse (1) else if the sub-groups (b) or (c) have been found, then choose Parse (2) else choose Parse (1) Figure 2: An ambiguous parsing rule and associated disambiguation procedure didates is to group the output of"]},{"title":"LEXTER,","paragraphs":["by conflating term candidates with other term candidates instead of confiating corpus occurrences with controlled terms.

Only few links are judged as conceptually irrelevant by the experts. For example, image d'embole tumorale (image of a tumorous embolus) is not considered as a correct variant of image tumorale (image of a tumor) because the first occurrence refers to an embolus while the second one refers to a tumor.","The experts were required to assess the proposed links and, in case of positive reply, they were required to provide a judgment about the actual conceptual relation between the connected terms. Although they performed the validation in-dependently, the three experts have proposed very similar types of conceptual relations between term candidates connected by syntactic variation links. At a coarse-grained level, they proposed the same three types of conceptual relations:","Synonymy Both connected terms are considered as equivalent by the expert: embole tumorale (tumorous embolus) / embole vasculaire tumorale (vascular tumorous embolus). The preceding example corresponds to a frequent situation of elliptic synonymy: the no-tion of integrated metonymy (Kleiber, 1989). In the medical domain, it is a common knowledge that an embole tumorale is an embole vasculaire tumorale, as everyone knows that sunflower oil is a synonym of sunflower seed oil.","Generic/specific relation One of the two terms denotes a concept that is finer than the other one: cellule dpithdliale cylindrique (cylindrical epithelial cell) is a specific type of cellule cylindrique (cylindrical cell).","Attributive relation As in the preceding case, there is a non-synonymous semantic relation between the two terms. One of them denotes a concept richer than the other one because it carries an additional attributes: a noyau volumineux irrdgulier (large irregular nucleus) is a noyau irrdgulier (irregular nucleus) that is additionally volumineux (large). 7 Future Work This study shows that the clustering of term candidates through term normalization is a powerful technique for enriching the network of term candidates produced by a Term Extraction tool such as LEXTER.","In our approach, term normalization is performed through the conflation of specific term variants. We have focused on syntactic variants that involve structural modifications (mainly modifier insertions). As reported in (Jacquemin, 1999), morphological and semantic variations are two other important families of term variations which can also be extracted by FASTR. They will be accounted for in order to enhance the number of clustered term candidates. It is our purpose to focus on these two types of variants in the near future.
