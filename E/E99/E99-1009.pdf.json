Such reasoning is precisely formulated in the Lambek calculus L. 2 Lambek sequent calculus In the sequent calculus of Lambek (1958) a sequent F ~ A consists of a sequence F of 'input' category formulas (the antecedent) and an 'output' category formula A (the succedent). A sequent states that the ordered concatenation of expressions in the categories F yields an expression of the category A. The valid sequents are the theorems derivable from the following axiom and rule schemata) (5) a. id A~A F~A A1,A, A2~C A1,F, A2~C b. A,F :=~ B kR F ~ A\\B Cut F~A AI,B, A2~ C A1, F, AkB, A2 ~ C C.

F1 ~A F2~B oR F1, F2 ~ AoB F1,A,B, F2~C F1,AoB, F2 ~ C .L ZThe completeness of the calculus with respect to the intended interpretation was proved in Pentus (1994). 62 F(n) and A(n) range over context sequences of category formulas; A, B, and A*B are referred to as the active formulas. The calculus L lacks the usual structural rules of permutation, contraction and weakening. Adding permutation collapses the two divisions into a single non-directional implication and yields the multiplicative fragment of intuitionistic linear logic, known as the Lambek-van Benthem calculus LP. 3","The validity of the id axiom and the Cut rule follows from the reflexivity and the transitivity respectively of set containment. The calculus enjoys the property of Cut elimination whereby every proof has a Cut-free equivalent (indeed, one in which only atomic id axioms are used: what we shall call [3rl-long sequent proofs). 4 Thus, processing can be performed using just the left (L) and right (R) rules. These rules all decompose active formulas A*B in the left or the right of the conclusions into subformulas A and B in the premises, and have exactly one connective occurrence less in the premises than in the conclusion; therefore one can compute all the (Cut-free) proofs of any sequent by traversing the finite space of proof search without Cut.","By way of illustration of the sequent calculus, the following is a proof of a theorem of lifting, or (subject) type raising: (6) N~N S~SkL N, N\\S ~ S /R N ~ S/(N\\S) Where a labels the antecedent, the coding of this proof as a lambda term ---what we 3Adding also contraction and weakening we obtain the implicational and conjunctive fragment of intuitionistic logic. Thus every Lambek proof can be read as an intuitionistic proof and has a constructive content which can be identified with its intuitionistic normal form natural deduction proof (Prawitz 1965) or, what is the same thing under the Curry-Howard correspondence, its normal form as a typed lambda term. 4By 'equivalent' we mean a proof of the same theorem with the same constructive content (fn. 3).

Logically speaking, this substitution at the lexico-syntactic interface is a Cut, and the normalisation is a process of Cut elimination. Currently the substitution and Cut elimination is executed after the proof search. However, if lexical semantics is represented as a proof-net, one can calculate off-line the module resulting from connecting the lexical semantics with a Cut to the module resulting from the unfolding of the lexical \" categories.","Lexical semantics expressed as a linear (=single bind) tambda term is unfolded into an (unordered) proof-net by the algorithm (26):","(26) a° Start with the )v-term go at a + node: q~+. b.

This enables us to represent the evaluated lexical modules as planar. However it should be noted that in general lexical substitution involves linking syntactic modules which are ordered with lexical semantic modules which are not ordered, and which could be multiple-binding, and Cut elimination has to be performed in a hybrid architecture which must preserve the linear precedence of syntactic literals. It is therefore of importance to the future generalization of the method we propose to investigate the precise nature of such hybrid architectures. 68 Proceedings of EACL '99"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["My thanks to Josep Mafia Merenciano for discussions relating to this work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bellin G. and Scott P.
