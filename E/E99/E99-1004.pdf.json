In software engineering, object-orientation has proved to be an effective means of separating the generic from the specialized, and more particularly, of letting the specialized inherit the generic (Rumbaugh et al., 1991). Identifying inheritable generic functionality (for confirmation, repair of misunderstanding, personalization of utterances, etc.) and specialized or highly domain-specific functionality, opens the way to dialogue systems that can be assembled largely from ready-made components and extended with the addition of more specialized components. The prototype system that we have been developing in Prolog++ for the last year combines this familiar object-oriented approach with a self-organizing, mixed-initiative dialogue strategy. Pseudocode is used here to represent the Prolog processing. 2"]},{"title":"Identifying the generic and the specialized","paragraphs":["In the course of developing the prototype system a number of important generic elements have been identified that can be ported with a minimum of alteration between domains.

The current system increments or decrements levels of 'confirmedness' depending on whether the user repeats or confirms, alters or negates values. If necessary, the system queries the user explicitly about values that are new, altered or negated.

Main System Components. 24 Proceedings of EACL '99","If the system is to conduct a dialogue as a human interlocutor might, it must use to best advantage whatever information it is given - whether that information was explicitly sought or not - and then be able to ask for information it still requires. Such self-organizing behaviour, as opposed to simpler state transitions (Novick and Sutton, 1996), generally has one of a number of possible motivations. The system may be planbased, attempting to identify and understand the ramifications of the problem the user wants to solve (Allen"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1996). Alternatively it may attempt to prove theorems, questioning the user for the missing facts that it needs to know in order to help him or her complete some complex task (Smith and Hipp, 1994). Or the system may attempt to identify or elicit specifically those facts that it needs to complete a 'request template' for a particular transaction.","It is essentially this last approach that the current prototype has adopted, and to this extent it resembles the SpeechMania system developed by Philips (Aust and Oerder, 1995), which has already been used successfully to implement a speech-based timetable enquiry system for Swiss Federal Railways (Aust"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1995). However, by additionally identifying generic and specialized functionality, including heuristics that would characterize a human expert, it becomes possible to create a dialogue management system that can cope with several real-world enquiry domains, or a number of complex subtasks, in one and the same adaptable, extensible implementation.","4 Generic behaviour - domain-specific knowledge The system is coloured throughout by a design philosophy that keeps the higher-level system components largely ignorant of the capabilities of the lower-level system. This has the advantage that higher-level, generic dialogue functionality can remain unchanged as the lower-level system is adapted for specialized real-world application areas. However, it goes without saying that the higher-level components must know how to access the lower-level functionality.","Domain Spotter is one such higher-level component in the current prototype. Its purpose is a very simple one: it consists of a collection of rules that the Dialogue Manager uses to pass enquiries of different types to the most appropriate domain experts. For it to work - in the current implementation - Domain Spotter relies on the assumption that recognizer-grammar functionality (outside the scope of the current implementation) will be sufficiently powerful to identify key semantic content from the user's utterance, content that may be characteristic of possibly one or more real-world business domains. Domain Spotter's heuristics then tell it broadly where the corresponding domain-related functionality resides in the system. It may then have to determine, if necessary by quizzing the user further, which of several Expert subclasses is best suited to the current enquiry.","If, for example the user's utterance indicates simply that he or she wants to make a booking and no further details are given, Domain Spotter is programmed to interrogate the Expert subclasses to find out which ones can handle bookings. (Prolog++ conveniently provides a call to all subclasses of a given type.) On the basis of the responses it obtains, it may subsequently have to ask the user to narrow the scope of the enquiry.

In the next dialogue turn the Dialogue Manager uses the contents of the list to offer the user a selection of business areas to choose from.

The expert then has to decide using its own heuristics what use it can make of the attributes."]},{"title":"5 Finding an object to handle the transaction","paragraphs":["At this point the enquiry is still being processed quite generically at the level of an Expert subclass","let us assume the Travel Expert, in order to explore further the evolution of a typical transaction. However, for the enquiry to stand any chance of reaching a successful conclusion, it must eventually be processed by an instance of a class (in object-oriented terms a specific 'object'), representing an actual company or organisation that has a highly detailed knowledge of the required service. (Cf. Wang (1998), who uses a semantic grammar in a base class to provide high level understanding of an utterance, and then finds a 'best match' from among the grammars of derived classes for a more detailed understanding.)","Thus, having been passed the enquiry by Domain Spotter, the Travel Expert subclass now attempts to identify the most suitable Travel Expert instance to handle the enquiry, or if it is unable to do so in this dialogue turn, to elicit further information from the user to help it identify a 'handling instance'. In a move analogous to the one adopted by Domain Spotter previously, the Travel Expert interrogates its instances and has them push their area of expertise (their area attribute - railway, airline, etc.) on to Domain Spotter's candidate list. In the next turn the Dialogue Manager will ask the user to narrow the enquiry to one of the areas available.","Although the system may request specific information (as in the turn above), the user may supply rather more than this. Using the heuristics of the relevant Expert subclass (here the Travel Expert), the system analyses the supplied information, to try to establish the context of the transaction, and then to process the transaction within that context. Again, the system is aiming to find the object (the :representation of a real-world business) that is best suited to processing the transaction to its conclusion. Let us explore this further."]},{"title":"6 A flexible response","paragraphs":["At the early stages of the transaction Domain Spotter polls the Expert class and subclasses (on the basis of the semantic content of the user's utterance) with the goal of finding a handling instance. If in response to the system's question 'Is that a railway ticket or an airline ticket?' the user says that he or she wants a ticket with a particular airline, processing is immediately taken up by the appropriate airline instance. Alternatively the user might respond along the lines that he or she wants 'a plane ticket for London on Friday at around nine a.m.' Assuming that a phrase such as 'ticket to London' has been successfully parsed as a travel-related request, Domain Spotter will pass the query to the Travel Expert class, which in turn will interrogate its instances to see how many have airline as an attribute and travel to the destination on the day and at the time requested.

Again, the analogy with Domain Spotter's own interrogation technique holds good.","Now the role of the instances becomes more important. In the prototype system the instances contain, as one of their attributes, specific details of the service they offer: in the case of a Travel Expert instance this will be a schedule; in the case of an Event Expert instance a programme of shows. In a more realistic implementation the instance is more likely to serve as the gateway to a corporate database. Nonetheless, whatever the implementation, the instance will serve as the means by which the system at large has access to the detailed information it needs to complete the transaction.","If as a result of the interrogation above, there are several candidates for 'handling instance' on Domain Spotter's candidate list, the Dialogue Manager, in the system's next turn, will prompt"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["user to choose one of them (and, of course, accept any additional information that the user might provide). If there is only one candidate, or indeed if at some point the user specifically names the instance he or she wants to provide the service ('I'd like to book a flight with Aer Lingus.'), the system can move the dialogue into its final stage, where the semantic content of the user's utterances is methodically confirmed and checked for compatibility with the instance's data, and where data still required for closure of the transaction are elicited from the user."]},{"title":"7 An engine for confirmation strategies","paragraphs":["Perhaps the most domain-independent element of the system is the Enquiry Processor class, which implements the generic confirmation strategies that must be performed in a system intended to cope with imperfect speech recognition, and users who change their mind. In reality, Enquiry Processor adopts quite a mechanistic approach to confirmation and this routine functionality is inherited, via the Expert class and the Expert subclasses, by the 'handling instances' that ultimately process the enquiry.","Enquiry Processor has two strategies, used in combination, to help it decide whether the attributes of a user's utterance have been confirmed to a sufficient degree to be used as input in the final transaction (the actual process of reserving a ticket for a journey or an event). On the one hand, Enquiry Processor assigns an appropriate status to each of the attributes in the user's utterance (from the set defined by Heisterkamp and McGlashan (1996)) and updates the statuses as the dialogue evolves. Enquiry Processor is designed to perform this function regardless of how many attributes might be associated with the concept expressed in the user's utterance - though realistically even a complex concept, such as a booking for a return trip, will have no more than about fourteen attributes, covering place of departure, destination, details of outward and return journey, and so on. Within Enquiry Processor the attributes are processed simply as members of a list of arbitrary length. Each attribute is structured as follows. attribute(type, value, status, system intention) The attribute's status is generally assigned one of the following values: • new for system • inferred by system • repeated by user • modified by user • negated by user A suite of evolve predicates represent the rules by which the statuses are updated as values are repeated, modified or negated by the user, or inferred by the system, evolve takes the following form: evolve(type, last value, last status, current value, new value, new status). The new status of any given attribute is therefore determined by its last value, its current value (i.e. its value in the user's current utterance), and its last status. The last value and last status are taken from the Discourse Stack, a discrete system component comprising a list and functionality to push and pop the concepts and attributes that document the user's utterances and the system's responses. Enquiry Processor also contains the rules that determine the system's spoken response to an attribute, taking into account not only the status of the individual attribute but also of the other attributes in the overall enquiry concept. Following invocation of the rules, the system intention parameter of the attribute term is set to the system's intended next move in regard to the attribute - whether it will confirm, query, etc., the attribute. This is especially important in the event that the user replies simply 'yes' or 'no' in his or her subsequent turn. Moreover, Enquiry Processor's rules not only determine the system's responses, but also help it prioritize its responses: for example, before doing anything else it will question the user about any value that he or she has negated since negation represents a significant misunderstanding or change of plan; if it needs to confirm attributes, it will attempt to 27 Proceedings of EACL '99 confirm no more than three in a single turn.
