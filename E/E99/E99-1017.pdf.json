Johnson (1972) has shown that such rewrite rules are equivalent to finite state transducers in the special case that they are not allowed to rewrite their own output. An algorithm for compilation into transducers was provided by Kaplan and Kay (1994). Improvements and extensions to this algorithm have been provided by Karttunen (1995), Karttunen (1997), Karttunen (1996) and Mohri and Sproat (1996). In this paper, the algorithm will be extended to provide a limited form of backreferencing. Backreferencing has been implicit in previous research, such as in the \"batch rules\" of Kaplan and Kay (1994), bracketing transducers for finite-state parsing (Karttunen, 1996), and the \"LocalExtension\" operation of Roche and Schabes (1995). The explicit use of backreferencing leads to more elegant and general solutions.","Backreferencing is widely used in editors, script-ing languages and other tools employing regular expressions (Friedl, 1997). For example, Emacs uses the special brackets \\( and \\) to capture strings along with the notation \\n to recall the nth such string. The expression \\(a*\\)b\\l matches strings of the form anba n. Unrestricted use of backreferencing thus can introduce non-regular languages. For NLP finite state calculi (Karttunen et al., 1996; van Noord, 1997) this is unacceptable. The form of backreferences introduced in this paper will therefore be restricted.","The central case of an allowable backreference is: x ~ T(x)/A__p (1) This says that each string x preceded by A and followed by p is replaced by T(x), where A and p are arbitrary regular expressions, and T is a transducer) This contrasts sharply with the rewriting rules that follow the tradition of Kaplan & Kay:"]},{"title":"¢ ~ ¢l:~__p (2)","paragraphs":["In this case, any string from the language ¢ is replaced by any string independently chosen from the language ¢.","We also allow multiple (non-permuting) backreferences of the form:","~The syntax at this point is merely suggestive. As an example, suppose that T,c,. transduces phrases into acronyms. Then x =¢~ T=cr(x)/(abbr)__(/abbr> would transduce <abbr>non-deterministic finite automaton</abbr> into <abbr>NDFA</abbr>.","To compare this with a backreference in Perl, suppose that T~cr is a subroutine that converts phrases into acronyms and that R~¢,. is a regular expression matching phrases that can be converted into acronyms. Then (ignoring the left context) one can write something like: s/(R~c,.)(?=(/ASBR))/T,,c~($1)/ge;. The backreference variable, $1, will be set to whatever string R~c,. matches. 126 Proceedings of EACL '99 xlx2.., xn ~ Tl(xl)T2(x2)...Tn(x,O/A--p (3) Since transducers are closed under concatenation, handling multiple backreferences reduces to the problem of handling a single backreference: x ~ (TI\" T2..... T,O(x)/A--p (4) A problem arises if we want capturing to follow the POSIX standard requiring a longest-capture strategy. ~riedl (1997) (p. 117), for example, discusses matching the regular expression (toltop)(olpolo)?(gicallo?logical) against the word: topological. The desired result is that (once an overall match is established) the first set of parentheses should capture the longest string possible (top); the second set should then match the longest string possible from what's left (o), and so on. Such a left-most longest match concatenation operation is described in §3.","In the following section, we initially concentrate on the simple Case in (1) and show how (1) may be compiled assuming left-to-right processing along with the overall longest match strategy described by Karttunen (1996).","The major components of the algorithm are not new, but straightforward modifications of components presented in Karttunen (1996) and Mohri and Sproat (1996). We improve upon existing approaches because we solve a problem concerning the use of special marker symbols (§2.1.2). A further contribution is that all steps are implemented in a freely available system, the FSA Utilities of van Noord (1997) (§2.1.1). 2 The Algorithm 2.1 Preliminary Considerations Before presenting the algorithm proper, we will deal with a couple of meta issues. First, we introduce our version of the finite state calculus in §2.1.1. The treatment of special marker symbols is discussed in §2.1.2. Then in §2.1.3, we discuss various utilities that will be essential for the algorithm. 2.1.1 FSA Utilities","The algorithm is implemented in the FSA Utilities (van Noord, 1997). We use the notation provided by the toolbox throughout this paper. Table 1 lists the relevant regular expression operators. FSA Utilities offers the possibility to define new regular expression operators. For example, consider the definition of the nullary operator vowel as the union of the five vowels:","[] empty string","[El,... En] concatenation of E1 ... En","{} empty language","<El,...En} union of El,...En E* Kleene closure E ̂optionality","-E complement EI-E2 difference $ E containment E1 ~ E2 intersection","any symbol A : B pair E1 x E2 cross-product A o B composition","domain(E) domain of a transduction range (E) range of a transduction","ident ity (E) identity transduction","inverse (E) inverse transduction Table 1: Regular expression operators. macro (vowel, {a, e, i,o,u}). In such macro definitions, Prolog variables can be used in order to define new n-ary regular expression operators in terms of existing operators. For instance, the lenient_composition operator (Karttunen, 1998) is defined by:","macro (priorityiunion (Q ,R),","{Q, -domain(Q) o R}).","macro (lenient_composition (R, C),","priority_union(R o C,R)). Here, priority_union of two regular expressions Q and R is defined as the union of Q and the composition of the complement of the domain of Q with R. Lenient composition of R and C is defined as the priority union of the composition of R and C (on the one hand) and R (on the other hand).","Some operators, however, require something more than simple macro expansion for their definition. For example, suppose a user wanted to match n occurrences of some pattern. The FSA Utilities already has the '*' and '+' quantifiers, but any other operators like this need to be user defined. For this purpose, the FSA Utilities supplies simple Prolog hooks allowing this general quantifier to be defined as:","macro (mat chn (N, X), Regex) • - mat ch_n (N, X, Regex).","match_n(O, _X, [] ) .","match_n(N,X, [XIRest]) :- N>O, N1 is N-l, mat ch_n (NI, X, Rest) . 127 Proceedings of EACL '99 For example: match_n(3,a) is equivalent to the ordinary finite state calculus expression [a, a, a].","Finally, regular expression operators can be defined in terms of operations on the underlying automaton. In such cases, Prolog hooks for manipulating states and transitions may be used. This functionality has been used in van Noord and Gerdemann (1999) to provide an implementation of the algorithm in Mohri and Sproat (1996). 2.1.2 Treatment of Markers","Previous algorithms for compiling rewrite rules into transducers have followed Kaplan and Kay (1994) by introducing special marker symbols"]},{"title":"(markers)","paragraphs":["into strings in order to mark off candidate regions for replace-ment. The assumption is that these markers are outside the resulting transducer's alphabets. But previous algorithms have not ensured that the assumption holds.","This problem was recognized by Karttunen (1996), whose algorithm starts with a filter transducer which filters out any string containing a marker. This is problematic for two reasons. First, when applied to a string that does happen to contain a marker, the algorithm will simply fail. Second, it leads to logical problems in the interpretation of complementation. Since the complement of a regular expression R is defined as E - R, one needs to know whether the marker symbols are in E or not. This has not been clearly addressed in previous literature.","We have taken a different approach by providing a contextual way of distinguishing markers from non-markers. Every symbol used in the algorithm is replaced by a pair of symbols, where the second member of the pair is either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether the first member is a marker or not. 2 As the first step in the algorithm, O's are inserted after every symbol in the input string to indicate that initially every symbol is a non-marker. This is defined as: macro (non_markers, [?, [] :0] *) .","Similarly, the following macro can be used to insert a 0 after every symbol in an arbitrary expression E.","2This approach is similar to the idea of laying down tracks as in the compilation of monadic second-order logic into automata Klarlund (1997, p. 5). In fact, this technique could possibly be used for a more efficient implementation of our algorithm: instead of adding transitions over 0 and 1, one could represent the alphabet as bit sequences and then add a final 0 bit for any ordinary symbol and a final 1 bit for a marker symbol.","macro (non_markers (E), range (E o non_markers)). Since E is a recognizer, it is first coerced to identity(E). This form of implicit conversion is standard in the finite state calculus.","Note that 0 and 1 are perfectly ordinary alphabet symbols, which may also be used within a replacement. For example, the sequence [i,0] represents a non-marker use of the symbol I. 2.1.3 Utilities","Before describing the algorithm, it will be helpful to have at our disposal a few general tools, most of which were described already in Kaplan and Kay (1994). These tools, however, have been modified so that they work with our approach of distinguishing markers from ordinary symbols. So to begin with, we provide macros to describe the alphabet and the alphabet extended with marker symbols: macro (sig, [?, 0] ). macro (xsig, [?, {0,1}] ).","The macro xsig is useful for defining a special-ized version of complementation and containment: macro(not (X) ,xsig* - X). macro ($$ (X), [xsig*, X, xsig*] ).","The algorithm uses four kinds of brackets, so it will be convenient to define macros for each of these brackets, and for a few disjunctions. macro (lbl, [' <1 ', 1] ) macro (lb2, [' <2', 1] ) macro (rb2, [' 2> ', 1] ) macro (rbl, [' 1> ', 1] ) macro (lb, {lbl, lb2}) macro (rb, {rbl ,rb2}) macro (bl, {lbl, rbl}) macro (b2, {lb2, rb2}) macro (brack, {lb, rb}).","As in Kaplan & Kay, we define an Intro(S) operator that produces a transducer that freely in-troduces instances of S into an input string. We extend this idea to create a family of Intro operators.

A string is described by this expression iff each prefix in L1 is followed by a suffix in L2 and each suffix in L2 is preceded by a prefix in L1. In our approach, this is defined as:","macro(if_p then s(L1,L2),","not( iLl ,not (L2) ] )).","macro (if s then_p (L1,L2),","not ( [not (al), L2] ) ).","macro (p_iff_s (LI, L2),","if_p_then_s (LI, L2) if_s_then_p (LI ,L2) ).","To make the use ofp_iff_s more convenient, we introduce a new operator l_if f_r (L, R), which describes strings where every string position is preceded by a string in L just in case it is followed by a string in R: macro (l_iff_r (L ,R),","p_iff_s([xsig*,L] , [R,xsig*])) .","Finally, we introduce a new operator if (Condit ion, Then, Else) for conditionals. This operator is extremely useful, but in order for it to work within the finite state calculus, one needs a convention as to what counts as a boolean true or false for the condition argument. It is possible to define true as the universal language and false as the empty language: macro(true,? *). macro(false,{}).","With these definitions, we can use the complement operator as negation, the intersection operator as conjunction and the union operator as disjunction.

For the second step, we first consider a simple special case. If the empty string is in the language described by Right, then r(Right) should insert an rb2 in every string position. The definition of r(Right) is both simpler and more efficient if this is treated as a special case. To insert a bracket in every possible string position, we use: [[[] x rb2,sig]*,[] x rb2]","If the empty string is not in Right, then we must use intro(rb2) to introduce the marker rb2, fol]owed by l_iff_r to ensure that such markers are immediately followed by a string in Right, or more precisely a string in Right where additional instances of rb2 are freely inserted in any position other than the beginning.

The following lb2\" allows an optional lb2, which occurs when the empty string is in Phi.","The fourth step is a guessing component which (ignoring complexities) looks for sequences of the form lb2 Phi rb2 and converts some of these into lbl Phi rbl, where the bl marking indicates that the sequence is a candidate for replacement. The complication is that Phi, as always, must be converted to non_markers (Phi) and instances of b2 need to be ignored. Furthermore, between pairs of lbl and rbl, instances of lb2 are deleted.

So it is not possible to have a single expression in the finite state calculus that applies to all possible lenghts.

In that case it will be possible to implement different steps by different strategies, e.g. by deterministic or non-deterministic transducers or bimachines (Roche and Schabes, 1997b).
