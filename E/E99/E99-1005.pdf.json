Psycholinguists have investigated whether the plausibility of the direct object affects reading times for sentences like (1). Here, argument plausibility refers to \"pragmatic plausibility\" or \"local semantic fit\" (Holmes et al., 1989), and judgements of plausibility are typically obtained by asking subjects to rate sentence fragments containing verb-argument combinations (as an example consider the bracketed parts of the sentences in (1)). Such experiments typically use an ordinal scale for plausibility (e.g., from 1 to 7). (1) a. [The senior senator regretted the"]},{"title":"decision]","paragraphs":["had ever been made public. b.

The majority of research has focussed on investigating the effect of rated plausibility for verb-object combinations in human sentence processing (Garnsey et al., 1997; Pickering and Traxler, 1998). However, plausibility effects have also been observed for adjective-noun combinations in a head-modifier relationship.","Murphy (1990) has shown that typical adjective-noun phrases (e.g., salty olives) are easier to in-terpret in comparison to atypical ones (e.g., sweet olives). Murphy provides a schema-based explanation for this finding by postulating that in typical adjective-noun phrases, the adjective modifies part of the noun's schema and consequently it is understood more quickly, whereas in atypical combinations, the adjective modifies non-schematic aspects of the noun, which leads to interpretation difficulties.","Smadja (1991) argues that the reason people prefer strong tea to powerful tea and powerful car to strong car is neither purely syntactic nor purely semantic, but rather lexical.","A similar argument is put forward by Cruse (1986), who observes that the adjective spotless collocates well with the noun kitchen, relatively worse with the noun complexion and not all with the noun taste. According to Cruse, words like spotless have idiosyncratic collocational restrictions: differences in the degree of acceptability of the adjective and its collocates do not seem to depend on the meaning of the individual words. 1.1"]},{"title":"Motivation","paragraphs":["Acquiring plausibility ratings for word combinations (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-object, noun-noun) can be useful in particular for language generation. Consider a generator which has to make a choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen. An empirical model of plausibility could predict that spotless kitchen is a plausible lexical choice, while flawless kitchen is not.","Adjective-noun combinations can be hard to generate given their collocational status. For a generator which selects words solely on semantic grounds with-out taking into account lexical constraints, the choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen may look equivalent. Current work in natural language generation (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight, 1998) has shown that corpus-based knowledge can be used to address lexical choice noncompositionally. 30 Proceedings of EACL '99","In the work reported here we acquire plausibility ratings for adjective-noun combinations by eliciting judgements from human subjects, and examine the extent to which different corpus-based models correlate with human intuitions about the \"goodness of fit\" for a range of adjective-noun combinations.","The research presented in this paper is similar in motivation to Resnik's (1993) work on selectional restrictions. Resnik evaluated his information-theoretic model of selectional constraints against human plausibility ratings for verb-object combinations, and showed that, in most cases, his model assigned higher selectional association scores to verb-object combinations which were judged more plausible by human subjects.","We test five corpus-based models against human plausibility judgements: 1.

This measure is attractive because it combines statistical and knowledge-based methods. By exploiting a knowledge-based taxonomy, it can capture conceptual information about lexical items and hence can make predictions about word combinations which have not been seen in the corpus.","In the following section we describe our method for eliciting plausibility judgements for adjective-noun combinations. Section 3 reports the results of using the five corpus-based models as predictors of adjective-noun plausibility. Finally, section 4 offers some discussion of future work, and section 5 concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2 Collecting Plausibility Ratings","paragraphs":["In order to evaluate the different corpus-based models of adjective-noun plausibility introduced above, we first needed to establish an independent measure of plausibility. The standard approach used in experimental psycholinguistics is to elicit judgements from human subjects; in this section we describe our method for assembling the set of experimental materials and collecting plausibility ratings for these stimuli."]},{"title":"2.1 Method Materials and Design.","paragraphs":["The ideal test of any of the proposed models of adjective-noun plausibility will be with randomly-chosen materials. We chose 30 adjectives according to a set of minimal criteria (detailed below), and paired each adjective with a noun selected randomly from three different frequency ranges, which were defined by co-occurrence counts in the 100 million word British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard (1995)). The experimental design thus consisted of one factor, Frequency Band, with three levels (High, Medium, and Low).","We chose the adjectives to be minimally ambiguous: each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and was unambiguously tagged as \"adjective\" 98.6% of the time, measured as the number of different part-of-speech tags assigned to the word in the BNC. The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million.","We identified adjective-noun pairs by using Gsearch (Corley et al., 1999), a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a userspecified context free grammar and a syntactic query. Gsearch was run on a lemmatised version of the BNC so as to compile a comprehensive corpus count of all nouns occurring in a modifier-head relationship with each of the 30 adjectives. Examples of the syntactic patterns the parser identified are given in Table 1. From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser we extracted a table containing the adjective and the head of the noun phrase following it. In the case of compound nouns, we only included sequences of two 31 Proceedings of EACL '99 nouns, and considered the rightmost occurring noun as the head.","From the retrieved adjective-noun pairs, we removed all pairs where the noun had a BNC frequency of less than 10 per million, as we wanted to reduce the risk of plausibility ratings being influenced by the presence of a noun unfamiliar to the subjects. Finally, for each adjective we divided the set of pairs into three \"bands\" (High, Medium, and Low), based on an equal division of the range of log-transformed co-occurrence frequency, and randomly chose one noun from each band. Example stimuli are shown in Table 2. The mean log co-occurrence frequencies were 3.839, 2.066 and .258, for the High, Medium, and Low groups, respectively.","30 filler items were also included, in order to ensure subjects produced a wide range of plausibility ratings. These consisted of 30 adjective-noun combinations that were not found in a modifier-head relation in the BNC, and were also judged highly implausible by the authors."]},{"title":"Procedure.","paragraphs":["The experimental paradigm was magnitude estimation (ME), a technique standardly used in psychophysics to measure judgements of sensory stimuli (Stevens, 1975), which Bard et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997) have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judgements. The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive. In contrast to the 5- or 7-point scale conventionally used to measure human intuitions, ME employs an interval scale, and therefore produces data for which parametric inferential statistics are valid.","ME requires subjects to assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional fashion. Subjects are first exposed to a modulus item, which they assign an arbitrary number. All other stimuli are rated proportional to the modulus. In this way, each subject can establish their own rating scale, thus yielding maximally fine-graded data and avoiding the known problems with the conventional ordinal scales forlinguistic data (Bard et al., 1996; Cowart, 1997; Schfitze, 1996).","In the present experiment, subjects were presented with adjective-noun pairs and were asked to rate the degree of adjective-noun fit proportional to a modulus item. The experiment was carried out using WebExp, a set of Java-Classes for administering psycholinguis-tic studies over the Word-Wide Web (Keller et al., 1998). Subjects first saw a set of instructions that explained the ME technique and included some exampies, and had to fill in a short questionnaire including basic demographic information. Each subject saw all 120 items used in the experiment (3 x 30 experimental items and 30 fillers). Subjects. The experiment was completed by 24 unpaid volunteers, all native speakers of English. Subjects were recruited via postings to local Usenet newsgroups."]},{"title":"2.2 Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["As is standard in magnitude estimation studies, statistical tests were done using geometric means to normalise the data (the geometric mean is the mean of the logarithms of the ratings). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the Frequency Band effect was significant, in both by-subjects and by-items analyses: FI(2, 46) = 79.09, p < .001; F2(2, 58) = 19.99, p < .001. The geometric mean of the ratings for adjective-noun combinations in the High band was 2.966, compared to Medium items at 2.660 and Low pairs at 2.271.1 Post-hoc Tukey tests indicated that the differences between all pairs of conditions were significant at o~ = .01, except for the difference between the High and Medium bands in the by-items analysis, which was significant at o~ = .05. These results are perhaps unsurprising: pairs that are more familiar are rated as more plausible than combinations that are less familiar. In the next section we explore the linear relationship between plausibility and co-occurrence frequency further, using correlation analysis."]},{"title":"3 Corpus-based Modelling 3.1 Method","paragraphs":["We correlated rated plausibility (Plaus) with the following five corpus-based variables: (1) log-transformed co-occurrence frequency (CoocF), measured as the number of times the adjective-noun pair occurs in the BNC; (2) log-transformed noun frequency (NounF), measured as the number of times the head noun occurs in the BNC; (3) conditional probability (CondP) of the noun given the adjective estimated as shown in equation (2); (4) collocational status, 2 estimated using the log-likelihood statistic (LLRatio); and (5) Resnik's measure of selectional association (SelAssoc), which measures the semantic fit of a particular semantic class c as an argument to a predicate pi.

We discuss each predictor variable in more detail:","I. Familiarity of adjective-noun pair. Log-transformed corpus co-occurrence frequency was significantly correlated with plausibility (Pearson r = .570, n = 90, p < .01). This verifies the Frequency Band effect discovered by the ANOVA, in an analysis which compares the individual co-occurrence frequency for each item with rated plausibility, instead of collapsing 30 pairs together into an equivalence class. Familiarity appears to be a strong determinant of adjective-noun plausibility.","2. Familiarity of head noun. Log frequency of the head noun was not significantly correlated with plausibility (r = .098), which suggests that adjective-noun plausibility judgements are not influenced by noun familiarity.","3. Conditional probability. The probability of the noun given the adjective was significantly correlated with plausibility (r = .220, p < .05). This is unsurprising, as conditional probability was also correlated with co-occurrence frequency (r = .497, p < .01).","4. Collocational status. The log-likelihood statistic yielded a significant correlation with plausibility (r = .350, p < .01), a fact that supports the collocational nature of plausible adjective-noun combinations.

Resnik's metric was also negatively correlated with co-occurrence frequency (r = -.226, p < .05), but there was no correlation with noun frequency, conditional probability, or log-likelihood ratio. Since several of the corpus-based variables were in-tercorrelated, we also calculated the squared semipartial correlations between plausibility and each corpus-based variable. This allows the unique relationship between each predictor and plausibility (removing the effects of the other independent variables) to be determined. Co-occurrence frequency accounted uniquely for 15.52% of the variance in plausibility ratings, while noun frequency, conditional probability, log-likelihood ratio, and selectional association accounted for .51%, .53%, .41% and 1.7% of the variance, respectively. This confirms co-occurrence frequency as the best predictor of adjective-noun plausibility.","One explanation for the negative correlation between selectional association and plausibility, also pointed out by Resnik, is the difference between verb-object and adjective-noun combinations: combinations of the latter type are more lexical than conceptual in nature and hence cannot be accounted for on purely semantic or syntactic grounds.

Is a zero co-occurrence count merely the result of insufficient evidence, or is it a reflection of a linguistic constraint? We plan to conduct another rating experiment, this time with a selec-tion of stimuli that have a co-occurrence frequency of zero in the BNC.

Adjective-noun plausibility served as a test bed for a number of corpus-based models of linguistic plausibility. Plausibility judgements were obtained from human subjects for 90 randomly selected adjective-noun pairs. The ratings revealed a clear effect of familiarity of the adjective-noun pair (operationalised by corpus co-occurrence frequency).","In a correlation analysis we compared judged plausibility with the predictions of five corpus-based variables. The highest correlation was obtained with the co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair. Conditional probability, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik's (1993) selectional association measure were also significantly correlated with plausibility ratings. The correlation with Resnik's measure was negative, contrary to the predictions of his model. This points to a problem with his technique for estimating word class frequencies, which is aggravated by the collocational nature of noun-adjective combinations.","Overall, the results confirm the strongly lexicalist and collocational nature of adjective-noun combinations. This fact could be exploited in a generation system by taking into account corpus co-occurrence counts for adjective-noun pairs (which can be obtained straightforwardly) during lexical choice. Future research has to identify how this approach can be generalised to unseen data."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors acknowledge the support of the Alexander S.
