Several parsing algorithms have been proposed for this formalism, most of them based on tabular techniques, ranging from simple bottom-up algorithms (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) to sophisticated extensions of the Earley's algorithm (Schabes and Joshi, 1988; Schabes, 1994; Nederhof, 1997). However, it is difficult to inter-relate different parsing algorithms. In this paper we study several tabular algorithms for TAG parsing, showing their common characteristics and how one algorithm can be derived from another in turn, creating a continuum from simple pure bottom-up to complex predictive algorithms.","Formally, a TAG is a 5-tuple ~ = (VN,VT, S,I,A), where VN is a finite set of non-terminal symbols, VT a finite set of terminal symbols, S the axiom of the grammar, I a finite set of initial trees and A a finite set of auxiliary trees. IUA is the set of elementary trees. Internal nodes are labeled by non-terminals and leaf nodes by terminals or ~, except for just one leaf per auxiliary tree (the foot) which is labeled by the same non-terminal used as the label of its root node. The path in an elementary tree from the root node to the foot node is called the spine of the tree.","New trees are derived by adjoining: let a be a tree contaiIiing a node N ~ labeled by A and let","be an auxiliary tree whose root and foot nodes are also labeled by A. Then, the adjoining of at the adjunction node N ~ is obtained by excising the subtree of a with root N a, attaching j3 to N ° and attaching the excised subtree to the foot of ~. We use ~ E adj(N ~) to denote that a tree ~ may be adjoined at node N ~ of the elementary tree a.","In order to describe the parsing algorithms for TAG, we must be able to represent the partial recognition of elementary trees. Parsing algorithms for context-free grammars usually denote partial recognition of productions by dotted productions. We can extend this approach to the case of TAG by considering each elementary tree q, as formed by a set of context-free productions 7)(7): a node N ~ and its children N~... N~ are represented by a production N ~ --~ N~... N~. Thus, the position of the dot in the tree is indicated by the position of the dot in a production in 7)(3' ). The elements of the productions are the nodes of 150 Proceedings of EACL '99 the tree, except for the case of elements belonging to VT U {E} in the right-hand side of production. Those elements may not have children and are not candidates to be adjunction nodes, so we identify such nodes labeled by a terminal with that terminal.","To simplify the description of parsing algorithms we consider an additional production -r -+ R a for each initial tree and the two additional productions T --* R ~ and F ~ ~ 2_ for each auxiliary tree B, where R ~ and F ~ correspond to the root node and the foot node of/3, respectively. After disabling T and 2_ as adjunction nodes the generative capability of the grammars remains intact.","The relation ~ of derivation on P(7) is defined by 5 ~ u if there are 5', 5\", M ~, v such that 5 = 5'M~5 \", u = 5'v~\" and M \"r --+ v E 7)(3 ') exists. The reflexive and transitive closure of =~ is denoted :~ .","In a abuse of notation, we also use :~ to represent derivations involving an adjunction. So, 5 ~ u if there are 5~,~\",M'r,v such that 5 = 5'M~5 '', R ~ ~ viF~v3, ~ E adj(M~), M \"r --+ v2 and v = ¢~t?31v2u3 ~tt .","Given two pairs (p,q) and (i, j) of integers, (p,q) <_ (i,j) is satisfied if/< p and q _< j. Given two integers p and q we define p U q as p if q is undefined and as q if p is undefined, being undefined in other case. 1.1 Parsing Schemata We will describe parsing algorithms using Parsing Schemata, a framework for high-level description of parsing algorithms (Sikkel, 1997). An interesting application of this framework is the analysis of the relations between different parsing algorithms by studying the formal relations between their underlying parsing schemata. Originally, this framework was created for context-free grammars but we have extended it to deal with tree adjoining grammars.","A parsing system for a grammar G and string al ... a,~ is a triple (2:, 7-/, D), with :2 a set of items which represent intermediate parse results, 7-/ an initial set of items called hypothesis that encodes the sentence to be parsed, and Z) a set of deduction steps that allow new items to be derived from already known items. Deduction steps are of the form '~'~\"'~ cond, meaning that if all antecedents 7]i of a deduction step are present and the conditions cond are satisfied, then the consequent should be generated by the parser. A set 5 v C Z of .final items represent the recognition of a sentence. A parsing schema is a parsing system parameterized by a grammar and a sentence.","Parsing schemata are closely related to grammatical deduction systems (Shieber et al., 1995), where items are called formula schemata, deduction steps are inference rules, hypothesis are axioms and final items are goal formulas.","A parsing schema can be generalized from another one using the following transformations (Sikkel, 1997):","• Item refinement, multiple items. breaking single items into","• Step refinement, decomposing a single deduction step in a sequence of steps.","• Extension of a schema by considering a larger class of grammars.","In order to decrease the number of items and deduction steps in a parsing schema, we can apply the following kinds of filtering:","• Static filtering, in which redundant parts are simply discarded.","• Dynamic filtering, using context information to determine the validity of items.","• Step contraction, in which a sequence of deduction steps is replaced by a single one.","The set of items in a parsing system PAIg corresponding to the parsing schema Alg describing a given parsing algorithm Alg is denoted 2:Alg, the set of hypotheses 7/Alg, the set of final items ~'Alg and the set of deduction steps is denoted ~)Alg\" 2 A CYK-like Algorithm We have chosen the CYK-like algorithm for TAG described in (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) as our starting point. Due to the intrinsic limitations of this pure bottom-up algorithm, the grammars it can deal with are restricted to those with nodes having at most two children.","The tabular interpretation of this algorithm works with items of the form [N \"~ , i, j [ p, q I adj] such that N ~ ~ ai+l ...ap F ~ aq+l ...aj ai+l ... aj if and only if (p, q) 7~ (-, -) and N ~ ai+l.., aj if and only if (p,q) = (-,-), where N ~ is a node of an elementary tree with a label belonging to VN.","The two indices with respect to the input string i and j indicate the portion of the input string that has been derived from N \"~. If V E A, p and q are two indices with respect to the input string that indicate that part of the input string recognized 151 Proceedings of EACL '99 by the foot node ofv. In other casep= q =- representing they are undefined. The element adj indicates whether adjunction has taken place on node N r.","The introduction of the element adj taking its value from the set {true, false} corrects the items previously proposed for this kind of algorithms in (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) in order to avoid several adjunctions on a node. A value of true indicates that an adjunction has taken place in the node N r and therefore further adjunctions on the same node are forbidden. A value of false indicates that no adjunction was performed on that node. In this case, during future processing this item can play the role of the item recognizing the excised part of an elemetitary tree to be attached to the foot node of an auxiliary tree. As a consequence, only one adjunction can take place on an elementary node, as is prescribed by the tree adjoining grammar formalism (Schabes and Shieber, 1994). As an additional advantage, the algorithm does not need to require the restriction that every auxiliary tree must have at least one terminal symbol in its frontier (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985).

More for-mally, a parser satisfies the valid prefix property if for any substring al .. • ak read from the input string al . • • akak+ l •.. an guarantees that there is a string of tokens bl ... bin, where bi need not be part of the input string, such that al ... akbl . .. bm is a valid string of the language.","To maintain the valid prefix property, the parser must recognize all possible derived trees in prefix form. In order to do that, two different phases must work coordinately: a top-down phase that expands the children of each node visited and a bottom-up phase grouping the children nodes to indicate the recognition of the parent node (Schabes, 1991).","During the recognition of a derived tree in prefix form, node expansion can depend on adjunction operations performed in the previously visited part of the tree. Due to this kind of dependencies the set path is a context-free language (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987). A bottom-up algorithm (e.g. CYK-like or bottom-up Eaxley-like) can stack the dependencies shown by the context-free language defining the path-set. This is sufficient to get a correct parsing algorithm, but without the valid prefix property. To preserve this property the algorithm must have a top-down phase which also stacks the dependencies shown by the language defining the path-set. To transform an algorithm without the valid prefix property into another which preserves it is a difficult task because stacking operations performed during top-down and bottom-up phases must be correlated some way and it is not clear how to do so without augmenting the time complexity (Nederhof, 1997).","CYK-like, bottom-up Earley-like and Eaxleylike parsing algorithms described above do not preserve the valid prefix property because foot-prediction (a top-down operation) is not restrictive enough to guarantee that the subtree attached to the foot node really corresponds with a instance of the tree involved in the adjunction.","To obtain a Earley-like parsing algorithm for tree adjoining grammars preserving the valid prefix property we need to refine the items by in-cluding a new element to indicate the position of 154 Proceedings of EACL '99 the input string corresponding to the left-most extreme of the frontier of the tree to which the dotted rule in the item belongs:","[h,g \"~ ~ 5 ° v,i,j [ p,q] such that R ~ ~ ah+~ ...aiSvv and 5 =~ ai...ap F \"r aq+~ ...aj ~ ai...aj if and only if (p, q) # (-,-) and 5 ~ ai...aj if and only if (P, q) = (-, -).","Thus, an item [N ~ --+ 5 * v,i,j I P,q] of IPE corresponds now with a subset of {[h, N 7 --+ 5. v, i, j I P, q] } for all h e [0, n].

As intermediate algorithms, we have defined a bottom-up Earley-like parsing algorithm and an Earley-like parsing algorithm without the valid prefix property, which to our knowledge has not been previously described in literature 1. We have also shown how to transform one algorithm into the next using simple transformations.Other algorithms could also has been included in the continuum, but for reasons of space we have chosen to show only the algorithms we consider milestones in the development of parsing algorithms for TAG.","An interesting project for the future will be to translate the algorithms presented here to several proposed automata models for TAG which have an associated tabulation technique: Strongly Driven 2-Stack Automata (de la Clergerie and Alonso, 1998), Bottom-up 2-Stack Automata (de la Clergerie et al., 1998) and Linear Indexed Automata (Nederhof, 1998). 7 Acknowledgments This work has been partially supported by FEDER of European Union (1FD97-0047-C04-02) and Xunta de Galicia (and XUGA20402B97).
