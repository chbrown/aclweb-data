Roukos (1996) and Jurafsky et al. (1995) use structure-based language models in the context of speech applications. Grishman (1995) and Hobbs et al. (1995) use phrasal information in information extraction. Alshawi (1996) uses dependency information in a machine translation system. The need to impose structure leads to the need to have robust parsers. There have been two main robust parsing paradigms: Finite State Grammar-based approaches (such as Abney (1990), Grishman (1995), and Hobbs et al. (1997)) and Statistical Parsing (such as Charniak (1996), Magerman (1995), and Collins (1996)).","Srinivas (1997a) has presented a different approach called"]},{"title":"supertagging","paragraphs":["that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques.

Furthermore, given a sentence aligned parallel corpus of two languages and almost parse information for the sentences of one of the languages, one can rapidly develop a grammar for the other language using supertagging, as suggested by Bangalore (1998).","In contrast to the aforementioned work in supertag disambiguation, where the objective was to provide a-direct comparison between trigram models for part-of-speech tagging and supertagging, in this paper our goal is to improve the performance of supertagging using local techniques which avoid full parsing.

In Section 2, we briefly review the task of supertagging and the results from previous work. In Section 3, we explore contextual models. In Section 4, we outline various class based approaches.

Lastly, we 188 v Proceedings of EACL '99 present our conclusions in Section 6. 2 Supertagging Supertags, the primary elements of the LTAG formalism, attempt to localize dependencies, in-cluding long distance dependencies. This is accomplished by grouping syntactically or semantically dependent elements to be within the same structure. Thus, as seen in Figure 1, supertags contain more information than standard part-of-speech tags, and there are many more supertags per word than part-of-speech tags. In fact, supertag disambiguation may be characterized as providing an almost parse, as shown in the bottom part of Figure 1.","Local statistical information, in the form of a trigram model based on the distribution of supertags in an LTAG parsed corpus, can be used to choose the most appropriate supertag for any given word.

We hypothesize that the improvement is limited because of a large increase in the number of parameters to be estimated.","As an alternative, we explore a 3-gram mixed model that incorporates nearly all of the relevant information. This mixed model may be described as follows. Recall that we partition the set of all supertags into heads and modifiers. Modifiers have been defined so as to share the characteristic that each one either modifies exactly one item to the right or one item to the left. Consequently, we further divide modifiers into left modifiers (134) and right modifiers. Now, instead of fixing the conditioning context to be either the two previous tags (as in the trigram model) or the two previous head tags (as in the head trigram model) we allow it to vary according to the identity of the current tag and the previous conditioning context, as shown in Table 1. Intuitively, the mixed model is like the trigram model except that a modifier tag is discarded from the conditioning context when it has found an object of modification. The mixed model achieves an accuracy of 91.79%, a significant improvement over both the head trigram model's and the trigram model's accuracies, p < 0.05. Furthermore, this mixed model is computationally more efficient as well as more accurate than the 5-gram model. 3.3 Head Word Models Rather than head supertags, head words often seem to be more predictive of dependency relations. Based upon this reflection, we have implemented models where head words have been used as features.

We were only able to train the latter model with 250K of training data because of memory problems that were caused by computing the large parameter space of that model.","The salient characteristics of models that have been discussed in this subsection are summarized in Table 2. 3.4 Classifier Combination While the features that our new models have considered are useful, an n-gram model that considers all of them would run into severe sparse data problems. This difficulty may be surmounted through the use of more elaborate backoff techniques. On the other hand, we could consider using decision trees at choice points in order to decide which features are most relevant at each point. However, we have currently experimented with classifier combination as a means of ameliorating the sparse data problem while making use of the feature combinations that we have introduced.","In this approach, a selection of the discussed models is treated as a different classifier and is trained on the same data.

It is also","3Entries marked with an asterisk (\"*\") correspond to cases where the pairwise combination of classifiers was significantly better than either of their component classifiers, p < 0.05. marginally, but not significantly, higher than the 3-gram mixed model. It is also notable that the pairwise combination of the head word classifier and the mix word classifier yields a significant improvement over either classifier, p < 0.05, considering the disparity between the accuracies of its component classifiers. 3.5 Further Evaluation We also compare various models' performance on base-NP detection and PP attachment disambiguation. The results will underscore the adroitness of the classifier combination model in using both local and long distance features. They will also show that, depending on the ultimate application, one model may be more appropriate than another model.","A base-NP is a non-recursive NP structure whose detection is useful in many applications, such as information extraction. We extend our supertagging models to perform this task in a fashion similar to that described in Srinivas (1997b). Selected models have been trained on 200K words. Subsequently, after a model has supertagged the test corpus, a procedure detects base-NPs by scanning for appropriate sequences of supertags. Results for base-NP detection are shown in Table 4. Note that the mixed model performs nearly as well as the trigram model. Note also that the head trigram model is outperformed by the other models. We suspect that unlike the trigram model, the head model does not perform the accurate modeling of local context which is important for base-NP detection.","In contrast, information about long distance dependencies are more important for the the PP attachment task. In this task, a model must decide whether a PP attaches at the NP or the VP level. This corresponds to a choice between two PP supertags: one associated with NP attachment, and another associated with VP attachment.

In many applications, however, it is sufficient to reduce ambiguity to a small number of supertags per word. For example, using traditional TAG parsing methods, such are described in Schabes (1990), it is inefficient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for English such as XTAG (The XTAG-Group (1995)). In these circumstances, a single word may be associated with hundreds of supertags. Reducing ambiguity to some small number k, say k < 5 supertags per word 4 would accelerate parsing considerably. 5 As an alternative, once such a reduction in ambiguity has been achieved, partial parsing or other techniques could be employed to identify the best single supertag. These are the aims of class based models, which assign a small set of supertags to each word. It is related to work by Brown et al. (1992) where mutual information is used to cluster words into classes for language modeling. In our work with class based models, we have considered only trigram based approaches so far. 4.1 Context Class Model One reason why the trigram model of supertagging is limited in its accuracy is because it considers only a small contextual window around the word to be supertagged when making its tagging decision. Instead of using this limited context to pinpoint the exact supertag, we postulate that it may be used to predict certain","4For example, the n-best model, described below, achieves 98.4% accuracy with on average 4.8 supertags per word.","5An alternate approach to TAG parsing that effectively shares the computation associated with each lexicalized elementary tree (supertag) is described in Evans and Weir (1998). It would be worth comparing both approaches. structural characteristics of the correct supertag with much higher accuracy. In the context class model, supertags that share the same characteristics are grouped into classes and these classes, rather than individual supertags, are predicted by a trigram model. This is reminiscent of Samuelsson and Reich (1999) where some part of speech tags have been compounded so that each word is deterministically in one class.","The grouping procedure may be described as follows. Recall that each supertag corresponds to a lexicalized tree t E G, where G is a particular LTAG. Using standard FIRST and FOLLOW techniques, we may associate t with FOLLOW and PRECEDE sets, FOLLOW(t) being the set of supertags that can immediately follow t and PRECEDE(t) being those supertags that can immediately precede t. For example, an NP tree such as 81 would be in the FOLLOW set of a supertag of a verb that subcategorizes for an NP complement. We partition the set of all supertags into classes such that all of the supertags in a particular class are associated with lexicalized trees with the same PRECEDE and FOLLOW sets. For in-stance, the supertags tx and t2 corresponding respectively to the NP and S subcategorizations of a verb ]eared would be associated with the same class. (Note that a head NP tree would be a member of both FOLLOW(t1) and FOLLOW(t2).)","The context class model predicts sets of supertags for words as follows. First, the trigram model supertags each word wi with supertag ti that belongs to class Ci.6 Furthermore, using the training corpus, we obtain set D~ which contains all supertags t such that ~(wilt) > 0. The word wi is relabeled with the set of supertags C~ N Di.","The context class model trades off an increased ambiguity of 1.65 supertags per word on average, for a higher 92.51% accuracy. For the purpose of comparison, we may compare this model against a baseline model that partitions the set of all supertags into classes so that all of the supertags in one class share the same preterminal symbol, i.e., they are anchored by words which share the same part of speech. With classes defined in this manner, call C~ the set of supertags that belong to the class which is associated with word w~ in the test corpus. We may then associate with word w~ the set of supertags C~ gl Di, where Di is defined as above. This baseline procedure yields an aver-","6For class models, we have also experimented with a variant Where the classes are assigned to words through the model c ~ aTgmaxcl-I~=,~(w, IC~)~(C, IC~_lC,_2).

Here, classes are derived from a confusion matrix analysis of errors which the trigram model makes while supertagging. First, the trigram model supertags a tune set. A confusion matrix is constructed, recording the number of times supertag t~ was confused for supertag tj, or vice versa, in the tune set. Based on the top k pairs of supertags that are most confused, we construct classes of supertags that are confused with one another. For example, let tl and t2 be two PP supertags which modify an NP and VP respectively. The most common kind of mistake that the trigram model made on the tune data was to mistag tl as t2, and vice versa. Hence, tl and t2 are clustered by our method into the same confusion class. The second most common mistake was to confuse supertags that represent verb modifier PPs and those that represent verb argument PPs, while the third most common mistake was to confuse supertags that represent head nouns and noun modifiers. These, too, would form their own classes.","The confusion class model predicts sets of supertags for words in a manner similar to the context class model. Unlike the context class model, however, in this model we have to choose k, the number of pairs of supertags which are extracted from the confusion matrix over which confusion classes are formed. In our experiments, we have found that with k = 10, k = 20, and k = 40, the resulting models attain 94.61% accuracy and 1.86 tags per word, 95.76% accurate and 2.23 tags per word, and 97.03% accurate and 3.38 tags per word, respectively/","Results of these, as well as other models discussed below, are plotted in Figure 2.

Srinivas (1997b) discussed a lightweight dependency analyzer which assigns dependencies assuming that each word has been assigned a unique supertag. We are extending this algorithm to work with class based models which narrows down the number of supertags per word with much higher accuracy. Aside from the n-gram modeling that was a focus of this paper, we would also like to explore using other kinds of models, such as maximum entropy. 6 Conclusions We have introduced two different kinds of models for the task of supertagging. Contextual models show that features for accurate supertagging only produce improvements when they are appropriately combined. Among these models were: a one pass head model that reduces propagation of head detection errors of previous models by using supertags themselves to identify heads; a mixed model that combines use of local and long distance information; and a classifier combination model that ameliorates the sparse data problem that is worsened by the introduction of many new features. These models achieve better supertagging accuracies than previously obtained. We have also introduced class based models which trade a slight increase in ambiguity for significantly higher accuracy. Different class based methods are discussed, and the tradeoff between accuracy and ambiguity is demonstrated.","7Again, for the class C assign to a given word w~, we consider only those tags ti E C for which/5(wdti) > 0.
