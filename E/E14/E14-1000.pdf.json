This is the largest EACL meeting ever: with eighty long papers, almost fifty short ones, thirteen student research papers, twenty-six demos, fourteen workshops and six tutorials, we expect to bring to Gothenburg up to five hundred participants, for a week of excellent science interspersed with entertaining social events. It is hard to imagine how much work is involved in the preparation of such an event. It takes about three years, from the day the EACL board starts discussing the location and nominating the chairs, until the final details of the budget are resolved. The number of people involved is also huge, and I was fortunate to work with an excellent, dedicated and efficient team, to which I am enormously grateful. The scientific program was very ably composed by the Program Committee Chairs, Sharon Goldwater and Stefan Riezler, presiding over a team of twenty-four area chairs. Given that this year we had long paper submissions, followed by a rebuttal period, followed by a very stressed short paper reviewing period, this meant a lot of work. Overall, Sharon and Stefan handled over five hundred submissions, or over 1,500 reviews! The result of this work is a balanced, high-quality scientific program that I’m sure we will all enjoy. The PC Chairs have also selected the three invited speakers, and we will have the pleasure of attending keynotes delivered by Simon King, Ulrike von Luxburg, and Dan Roth – a great choice of speakers! The diverse workshop program was put together by the Workshop Chairs, Anja Belz and Reut Tsarfaty, under very strict deadlines due to the fact that as in previous years, workshops were coordinated with other ACL events (this year, ACL and EMNLP). Even in light of the competition, Anja and Reut negotiated a varied and attractive set of fourteen workshops which will keep us busy over the weekend prior to the main conference. Also on that weekend are the six tutorials, selected from among several submissions by the Tutorial Chairs, Afra Alishahi and Marco Baroni. Again, the tutorials offer a set of diverse and timely topics, covering both core areas of NLP and tangential fields of research. We included in the program a large number of demonstrations, selected by Marko Tadić and Bogdan Babych, the Demo Chairs. And an integral part of the scientific program is the Student Research Workshop, put together by the SRW Chairs, Desmond Elliott, Konstantina Garoufi, Douwe Kiela, and Ivan Vulić, whose work was supervised by the SRW Faculty Advisor, Sebastian Padó. The Proceedings that you’re reading now were compiled by the Publication Chairs, Gosse Bouma and Yannick Parmentier. Their responsibilities include the preparation of all the proceedings, including the main session, the SRW, the demo session, the workshop proceedings etc. – thousands of pages, all under very strict deadlines. It has been a very special pleasure for me to work with an excellent local organization team. The Local Organization Chairs, Lars Borin and Aarne Ranta, were assisted by an extremely efficient team, Yvonne Adesam, Martin Kaså and Nina Tahmasebi. Their effort cannot be overestimated: from dealing with the two universities over issues of conference space and funding, through dealing with two professional conference organizers, to corresponding with authors, participants and of course all the other chairs. Add the stress involved in being in charge of a hefty budget that has to be balanced by the end of the conference, and you can only admire the relaxed way in which they took upon themselves this daunting task. The local team included also Peter Ljunglöf, the Publicity Chair, to whom we should all be grateful for the beautiful web site of the conference and the timely e-mails, tweets and Facebook statuses. The Local Sponsorship Chairs, Sofie Johansson Kokkinakis and Staffan Larsson, worked together with the ACL iv Sponsorship Chairs Jochen Leidner and Alessandro Moschitti, to obtain some much needed financial support. Sincere thanks are due to the various sponsors for their generous contribution. The local team did a wonderful job organizing a social program this year. This includes a reception at the City Hall on Sunday, a catered poster and demo session on Monday, a conference dinner on Tuesday and of course, the famous Cortège at the very end of the conference. A perfect mix of business and pleasure. I am grateful to all members of the EACL board for their advice and guidance, and in particular to past Chair Sien Moens, Chair Stephen Clark, Chair-elect Lluìs Màrquez and Treasurer Mike Rosner. Many thanks are also due to the ACL Treasurer Graeme Hirst and of course, as always, to the ACL Business Manager Priscilla Rasmussen, who was always there with her vast experience to clear up uncertainties and lend a helping hand. Finally, let us not forget that this is all about you: authors, reviewers, demo presenters, workshop organizers and speakers, tutorial speakers and participants of the conference. Thank you for choosing to be part of EACL-2014, I wish you a very enjoyable conference!

EACL 2014 introduced a short paper (4 page) format in addition to the usual long paper (8 page) format, which led to the highest total number of submissions of any EACL. We received 317 valid long paper submissions and were able to accept 78 of these papers (an acceptance rate of 24.6%). 49 of the papers (15.4%) were accepted for oral presentation, and 31 (9.8%) for poster presentation. In addition, we received 199 valid short paper submissions and were able to accept 46 of these (an acceptance rate of 23.1%). 33 of the papers (16.6%) were accepted for oral presentation, and 13 (6.5%) for poster presentation. The EACL 2014 schedule also includes oral presentations from two papers published in the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, a new feature of this year’s conference. The introduction of short papers, handled in a second round of submissions, meant a somewhat higher workload for our program committee, and we are very grateful to our 24 area chairs for recruiting an excellent panel of 434 reviewers from all over the world, and to those reviewers for providing their feedback on the submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers (at least two for short papers), who were then encouraged to discuss any differences of opinion, taking into account the responses of the authors to their initial reviews. Based on the reviews, author response, and reviewer discussion, area chairs provided a ranking for papers in their area. Final selection was made by the program co-chairs after discussion with the area chairs and an independent check of reviews. Each area chair was also asked to nominate the best long paper and best short paper from his or her area, or to decline to nominate any. Several papers were nominated, and of these the program co-chairs made the final decision on the Best Long Paper and Best Short Paper awards, which will be awarded in a plenary session at the conference. In addition to the main conference program, EACL 2014 will feature the now traditional Student Research Workshop, 14 other workshops, 6 tutorials and a demo session with 26 presentations. We are also fortunate to have three excellent invited speakers: Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Ulrike von Luxburg (University of Hamburg), and Simon King (University of Edinburgh). We would very much like to thank all of the other people who have helped us put together this year’s conference. Most importantly, all of the authors who submitted their work to EACL, without whom we would have no conference at all! The number and quality of both long and short paper submissions in many different areas shows that we are maintaining and growing a broad and active community. We are greatly indebted to all the area chairs and reviewers for their hard work, which allowed us to choose from amongst the many high-quality submissions to put together a strong programme and provide useful feedback to authors. The START support team, and especially Rich Gerber, were of great help in swiftly answering all of our technical questions, and occasionally even knowing more about our job than we did! We thank the invited speakers for agreeing to present at EACL, and the publication chairs, Yannick Parmentier and Gosse Bouma, for putting this volume together. The local organizing committee (Lars Borin, Aarne Ranta, Yvonne Adesam, Martin Kaså, and Nina Tahmasebi) have been invaluable in arranging the logistics of the conference and coordinating with us on many organizational issues, and we are grateful to the publicity chair, Peter Ljunglöf, for ensuring up-to-date programme information on the conference web site. We thank also the Student Research Workshop chairs for smoothly coordinating with us on their schedule. Last but not least, we are indebted to the General Chair, Shuly Wintner, for his guidance and support throughout the whole process. We hope you enjoy the conference!
