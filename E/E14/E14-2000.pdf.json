This is the largest EACL meeting ever: with eighty long papers, almost fifty short ones, thirteen student research papers, twenty-six demos, fourteen workshops and six tutorials, we expect to bring to Gothenburg up to five hundred participants, for a week of excellent science interspersed with entertaining social events. It is hard to imagine how much work is involved in the preparation of such an event. It takes about three years, from the day the EACL board starts discussing the location and nominating the chairs, until the final details of the budget are resolved. The number of people involved is also huge, and I was fortunate to work with an excellent, dedicated and efficient team, to which I am enormously grateful. The scientific program was very ably composed by the Program Committee Chairs, Sharon Goldwater and Stefan Riezler, presiding over a team of twenty-four area chairs. Given that this year we had long paper submissions, followed by a rebuttal period, followed by a very stressed short paper reviewing period, this meant a lot of work. Overall, Sharon and Stefan handled over five hundred submissions, or over 1,500 reviews! The result of this work is a balanced, high-quality scientific program that I’m sure we will all enjoy. The PC Chairs have also selected the three invited speakers, and we will have the pleasure of attending keynotes delivered by Simon King, Ulrike von Luxburg, and Dan Roth – a great choice of speakers! The diverse workshop program was put together by the Workshop Chairs, Anja Belz and Reut Tsarfaty, under very strict deadlines due to the fact that as in previous years, workshops were coordinated with other ACL events (this year, ACL and EMNLP). Even in light of the competition, Anja and Reut negotiated a varied and attractive set of fourteen workshops which will keep us busy over the weekend prior to the main conference. Also on that weekend are the six tutorials, selected from among several submissions by the Tutorial Chairs, Afra Alishahi and Marco Baroni. Again, the tutorials offer a set of diverse and timely topics, covering both core areas of NLP and tangential fields of research. We included in the program a large number of demonstrations, selected by Marko Tadić and Bogdan Babych, the Demo Chairs. And an integral part of the scientific program is the Student Research Workshop, put together by the SRW Chairs, Desmond Elliott, Konstantina Garoufi, Douwe Kiela, and Ivan Vulić, whose work was supervised by the SRW Faculty Advisor, Sebastian Padó. The Proceedings that you’re reading now were compiled by the Publication Chairs, Gosse Bouma and Yannick Parmentier. Their responsibilities include the preparation of all the proceedings, including the main session, the SRW, the demo session, the workshop proceedings etc. – thousands of pages, all under very strict deadlines. It has been a very special pleasure for me to work with an excellent local organization team. The Local Organization Chairs, Lars Borin and Aarne Ranta, were assisted by an extremely efficient team, Yvonne Adesam, Martin Kaså and Nina Tahmasebi. Their effort cannot be overestimated: from dealing with the two universities over issues of conference space and funding, through dealing with two professional conference organizers, to corresponding with authors, participants and of course all the other chairs. Add the stress involved in being in charge of a hefty budget that has to be balanced by the end of the conference, and you can only admire the relaxed way in which they took upon themselves this daunting task. iv The local team included also Peter Ljunglöf, the Publicity Chair, to whom we should all be grateful for the beautiful web site of the conference and the timely e-mails, tweets and Facebook statuses. The Local Sponsorship Chairs, Sofie Johansson Kokkinakis and Staffan Larsson, worked together with the ACL Sponsorship Chairs Jochen Leidner and Alessandro Moschitti, to obtain some much needed financial support. Sincere thanks are due to the various sponsors for their generous contribution. The local team did a wonderful job organizing a social program this year. This includes a reception at the City Hall on Sunday, a catered poster and demo session on Monday, a conference dinner on Tuesday and of course, the famous Cortège at the very end of the conference. A perfect mix of business and pleasure. I am grateful to all members of the EACL board for their advice and guidance, and in particular to past Chair Sien Moens, Chair Stephen Clark, Chair-elect Lluìs Màrquez and Treasurer Mike Rosner. Many thanks are also due to the ACL Treasurer Graeme Hirst and of course, as always, to the ACL Business Manager Priscilla Rasmussen, who was always there with her vast experience to clear up uncertainties and lend a helping hand. Finally, let us not forget that this is all about you: authors, reviewers, demo presenters, workshop organizers and speakers, tutorial speakers and participants of the conference. Thank you for choosing to be part of EACL-2014, I wish you a very enjoyable conference!

The Demonstrations program primary aim is to present the software systems and solutions related to all areas of computational linguistics and natural language processing. This program encourages the early exhibition of research prototypes, but also includes interesting mature systems. Probably for the first time in the line of many EACL conferences, the number of contributions for demonstations of new/existing software systems dealing with different types of language/speech processing, exceeded the number of available slots by almost three times. This confronted us with the situation where we were forced to introduce a strict selection process although the number of very good and excellent demo proposals was surprisingly high. The selection process was completed following the predefined criteria of relevance for EACL2014 conference, novelty, overall usability and applicability to more than one linguistic level and to more than one computational linguistic field/task. The contributions that had to be left below the threshold were not necessary of lower quality, but found themselves in more competitive environment this time. We would like to thank the general chairs and the local organizers, without whom it would have been impossible to put together such a strong demonstations program. We hope you will find this proceedings useful and that the software systems presented in this proceedings will inspire new ideas and approaches in your future work.
