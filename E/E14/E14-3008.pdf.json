This property is marked grammatically in various languages, albeit rarely in English. It has recently been highlighted as a relevant property for NLP applications such as parsing and anaphora resolution. In order for animacy to be used in conjunction with other semantic features for such applications, appropriate data is necessary. However, the few corpora which do contain animacy annotation, rarely contain much other semantic information. The addition of such an annotation layer to a corpus already containing deep semantic annotation should therefore be of particular interest. The work presented in this paper contains three main contributions. Firstly, we improve upon the state of the art in multi-class animacy classification. Secondly, we use this classifier to contribute to the annotation of an openly available corpus containing deep semantic annotation. Finally, we provide source code, as well as trained models and scripts needed to reproduce the results presented in this paper, or aid in annotation of other texts.1"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Animacy is the semantic property of nouns denoting whether, or to what extent, the referent of that noun is alive, human-like or even cognitively sophisticated. Several ways of characteris-ing the animacy of such referents have been proposed in the literature, the most basic distinction being between animate and inanimate entities. In 1 https://github.com/bjerva/animacy such a binary scheme, examples of animate nouns might include author and dog, while examples of inanimate nouns might include table and rock. More elaborate schemes tend to represent a hierarchy or continuum typically ranging from HU-MAN → NON-HUMAN → INANIMATE (cf. Comrie (1989)), with other categories in between.","In various languages, animacy affects linguistic phenomena such as case marking and argument realization. Furthermore, hierarchical restrictions are often imposed by animacy, e.g. with subjects tending to be higher in an animacy hierarchy than objects (Dahl and Fraurud, 1996). Even though animacy is rarely overtly marked in English, it still influences the choice of certain grammatical structures, such as the choice of relative pronouns (e.g. who vs. which).","The aims of this work are as follows: (i) to improve upon the state of the art in multi-class animacy classification by comparing and evaluating different classifiers and features for this task,(ii) to investigate whether a corpus of spoken language containing animacy annotation can be used as a basis to annotate animacy in a corpus of written language, (iii) to use the resulting classifier as part of the toolchain used to annotate a corpus containing deep semantic annotation.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we go through the relevance of animacy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and describe some corpora which contain animacy annotation. Previous attempts and approaches to animacy classification are portrayed in Section 3. Section 4 contains an overview of the data used in this study, as well as details regarding the manual annotation of animacy carried out as part of this work. The methods employed and the results obtained are presented in Sections 5 and 6. The discussion is given in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 contains conclusions and some suggestions for future work in multi-class animacy classification. 65"]},{"title":"2 Background 2.1 Relevance of animacy for NLP","paragraphs":["Although seemingly overlooked in the past, animacy has recently been shown to be an important feature for NLP. Øvrelid & Nivre (2007) found that the accuracy of a dependency parser for Swedish could be improved by incorporating a binary animacy distinction. Other work has highlighted animacy as relevant for anaphora and coreference resolution (Orăsan and Evans, 2007; Lee et al., 2013) and verb argument disambiguation (Dell’Orletta et al., 2005).","Furthermore, in English, the choices for dative alternation (Bresnan et al., 2007), between genitive constructions (Stefanowitsch, 2003), and between active and passive voice (Rosenbach, 2008) are also affected by the animacy of their constituent nouns. With this in mind, Zaenen et al. (2004) suggest that animacy, for languages such as English, is not a matter of grammatical and un-grammatical sentences, but rather of sentences being more and less felicitous. This highlights annotation of animacy as potentially particularly useful for applications such as Natural Language Generation.","In spite of this, animacy appears to be rarely annotated in corpora, and thus also rather rarely used in tools and algorithms for NLP (although some recent efforts do exist, cf. Moore et al. (2013)). Furthermore, the few corpora that do include animacy in their annotation do not contain much other semantic annotation, making them less interesting for computational semanticists. 2.2 Annotation of animacy Resources annotated with animacy are few and far between. One such resource is the MC160 dataset which has recently been labelled for binary animacy (Moore et al., 2013). The distinction between animate and inanimate was based on whether or not an entity could “move under its own will”. Although interesting, the size of this data set (approximately 8,000 annotated nouns) limits its usefulness, particularly with the methods used in this paper.","Talbanken05 is a corpus of Swedish spoken language which includes a type of animacy annotation (Nivre et al., 2006). However, this annotation is better described as a distinction between human and non-human, than between animate and inanimate (Øvrelid, 2009). Although the work in this paper focusses on English, a potential application of this corpus is discussed at the end of this paper (see Section 8).","The NXT Switchboard corpus represents a larger and more interesting resource for our purposes (Calhoun et al., 2010). This spoken language corpus contains high quality manual annotation of animacy for nearly 200,000 noun phrases (Zaenen et al., 2004). Furthermore, the annotation is fairly fine-grained, as a total of ten animacy categories are used (see Table 1), with a few addi-tional tags for mixed animacy and cases in which annotators were uncertain. This scheme can be arranged hierarchically, so that the classes Concrete, Non-concrete, Place and Time are grouped as inanimate, while the remaining classes are grouped as animate. The availability of this data allows us to easily exploit the annotation for a supervised learning approach (see Section 5)."]},{"title":"3 Related work","paragraphs":["In this section we will give an overview of previous work in animacy classification, some of which has inspired the approach presented in this paper. 3.1 Exploiting corpus frequencies A binary animacy classifier which uses syntactic and morphological features has been previously developed for Norwegian and Swedish (Øvrelid, 2005; Øvrelid, 2006; Øvrelid, 2009). The features used are based on frequency counts from the dependency-parsed Talbanken05 corpus. These frequencies are counted per noun lemma, mean-ing that this classifier is not context sensitive. In other words, cases of e.g. polysemy where head is inanimate in the sense of human head, but animate in the sense of head of an organization, are likely to be problematic. Intuitively, by taking context or semantically motivated features into account, such cases ought to be resolved quite trivially.","This classifier performs well, as it reaches an accuracy for 96.8% for nouns, as compared to a baseline of 90.5% when always picking the most common class (Øvrelid, 2009). Furthermore, it is shown that including the binary distinction from this classifier as a feature in dependency parsing can significantly improve its labelled attachment score (Øvrelid and Nivre, 2007).","A more language-specific system for animacy classification has also been developed for Japanese (Baker and Brew, 2010). In this work, vari-66 Table 1: Overview of the animacy tag set from Zaenen et al. (2004) with examples from the GMB.

VEH Vehicle Troops fired on the two civilians riding amotorcycle ... ous language-specific heuristics are used to improve coverage of, e.g., loanwords from English. The features used are mainly frequency counts of nouns as subjects or objects of certain verbs. This is then fed to a Bayesian classifier, which yields quite good results on both Japanese and English.","Taking these works into account, it is clear that the use of morphosyntactic features can provide relevant information for the task of animacy classification. However, both of these approaches use binary classification schemes. It is therefore not clear whether acceptably good results could be obtained for more elaborate schemes. 3.2 Exploiting lexico-semantic resources Orăsan & Evans (2007) present an animacy classifier which is based on knowledge obtained from WordNet (Miller, 1995). In one approach, they base this on the so-called unique beginners at the top of the WordNet hierarchy. The fact that some of these are closely related to animacy is then used to infer the animacy of their hyponyms. The inclusion of the classifications obtained by this system for the task of anaphora resolution is shown to improve its results.","An animacy classifier based on exploiting synonymy relations in addition to hyponymy and hyperonymy has been described for Basque (de Illaraza et al., 2002). In this work, a small set consisting of 100 nouns was manually annotated. Using an electronic dictionary from which semantic relations could be inferred, they then further automatically annotated all common nouns in a 1 million word corpus.","An approach to animacy classification for Dutch is presented in Bloem & Bouma (to appear). This approach exploits a lexical semantic resource, from which word-senses were obtained and merged per lemma. This is done, as they postulate that ambiguity in animacy per lemma ought to be relatively rare. Each lemma was then assigned a simplified animacy class depending on its animacy category – either human, non-human or inanimate. Similarly to Baker & Brew (2010), they also use dependency features obtained from an automatically parsed corpus for Dutch. This type-based approach obtains accuracies in the low 90% range, compared to a most frequent class baseline of about 81%.","Based on the three aforementioned works, it is clear that the use of semantic relations obtained from lexico-semantic resources such as WordNet are particularly informative for the classification of animacy. 3.3 Multi-class animacy classification An animacy classifier which distinguishes between ten different classes of animacy has been developed by Bowman & Chopra (2012). They use a simple logistic regression classifier and quite straight-forward bag-of-words and PoS features, as well as subject, object and PP dependencies. These are obtained from the aforementioned Switchboard corpus, for which they obtain quite good results.","A quite involved system for animacy classification based on using an ensemble of voters is presented by Moore et al. (2013). This system draws its strengths from the fact that it, rather than defining and using a large number of features and training one complex classifier, uses more in-terpretable voting models which differ depending on the class in question. They distinguish between three categories, namely person, animal and 67 inanimate. The voters comprise a variety of systems, based on the n-gram list method of Ji and Lin (2009), a WordNet-based approach similar to Orăsan & Evans (2007), and several others. Their results yield animacy detection rates in the mid-90% range, and can therefore be seen as an improvement upon the state of the art. However, comparison between animacy classification systems is not all that straight-forward, considering the disparity between the data sets and classification schemes used.","These two works show that multi-class animacy classification can be successfully done both with syntactic and semantic features."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["Two annotated corpora are used in this work. A further data source is concreteness ratings obtained through manual annotation (Brysbaert et al., 2013), and is used as a feature in the classifier. These ratings were obtained for approximately 40,000 English words and two-word expressions, through the use of internet crowd-sourcing. The rating was given on a five-point scale, ranging from abstract, or language based, to concrete, or experience based (Brysbaert et al., 2013). 4.1 The NXT Switchboard Corpus Firstly, the classifier is trained and evaluated on the Switchboard corpus, as this allows for direct comparison of results to at least one previous approach (i.e. Bowman & Chopra (2012)). 4.1.1 Pre-processing of spoken data The fact that the Switchboard corpus consists of transcribed spoken data presents challenges for some of the tools used in the feature extraction process. The primary concern identified, apart from the differing form of spoken language as compared to written language, is the presence of disfluency markers in the transcribed texts. As a preprocessing step, all disfluencies were removed using a simple automated script. Essentially, this consisted of removing all words tagged as interjections (labelled with the tag UH), as this is the tag assigned to disfluencies in the Switchboard corpus. Although interjections generally can be informative, the occurrences of interjections within NPs was restricted to usage as disfluencies. 4.2 The Groningen Meaning Bank There are several corpora of reasonable size which include semantic annotation on some level, such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), and the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al., 2005). The combination of several levels of semantic annotation into one formalism are not common, however. Although some efforts exist, they tend to lack a level of formally grounded “deep” semantic representation which combines these layers.","The Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) contains a substantial collection of English texts with such deep semantic annotation (Basile et al., 2012a). One of its goals is to combine semantic phenomena into a single formalism, as opposed to deal-ing with single phenomena in isolation. This provides a better handle on explaining dependencies between various ambiguous linguistic phenomena.","Manually annotating a comprehensive corpus with gold-standard semantic representations is obviously a hard and time-consuming task. There-fore, a sophisticated bootstrapping approach is used. Existing NLP tools are used to get a reasonable approximation of the target annotations to start with. Pieces of information coming from both experts (linguists) and crowd sourcing methods are then added in to improve the annotation. The addition of animacy annotation is done in the same manner. First, the animacy classifier will be incorporated into this toolchain. We then correct the tags for a subset of the corpus, which is also used to evaluate the classifier. Note that the classifier used in the toolchain uses a different model from the conditions where we evaluate on the Switchboard corpus. For the GMB, we include training data obtained through the crowd-sourcing game Wordrobe, which uses a subset of the data from the GMB (Venhuizen et al., 2013). 4.2.1 Annotation So as to allow for evaluation of the classifier on a widely used semantically annotated corpus, one part (p00) of the GMB was semi-manually annotated for animacy, although this might lead to a bias with potentially overly good results for our classifier, if annotators are affected by its output. We use the tagset presented by Zaenen et al. (2004), which is given in Table 1. This tagset was chosen for the addition of animacy annotation to the GMB. Including this level of annotation 68 Figure 1: A tagged document in the GMB. in a resource which already contains other semantic annotation should prove particularly useful, as this allows animacy to be used in conjunction with other semantically based features in NLP tools and algorithms. This annotation was done using the GMB’s interface for expert annotation (Basile et al., 2012b). A total of 102 documents, containing approximately 15,000 tokens, were annotated by an expert annotator, who corrected the tags assigned by the classifier. We assign animacy tags to all nouns and pronouns. Similarly to our tagging convention for named entities, we assign the same tag to the whole NP, so that wagon driver is tagged with HUM, although wagon in isolation would be tagged with CNC. This has the added advantage that this is the manner in which NPs are annotated in the Switchboard corpus, making evaluation and comparison with Bowman & Chopra (2012) somewhat more straight-forward. An example of a tagged document can be seen in Figure 1. Table 2 shows the amount of annotated nouns per class. In order to verify the integrity of this annotation, two other experts annotated a random selection of ten documents. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated using Fleiss’ kappa on this selection, yielding a score of κ = .596.

All classifiers used are obtained from the implementations provided by SciKit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). For each type of classifier, we train one classifier for each class in a one-versus-all fashion. For source code, trained models and scripts to run the experiments in this paper, please see https://github.com/bjerva/ animacy.","The classifiers are trained on a combination of the Switchboard corpus and data gathered from Wordrobe, depending on the experimental condition. In addition to the features explained below, the classifier exploits named entity tags, in that these override the proposed animacy tag where applicable. That is to say, if a named entity has already been identified and tagged as, e.g., a person, this is reflected in the animacy layer with the HUM tag.","Considering that the balance between samples per class is quite skewed, an attempt was made at placing lower weights on the samples from the majority classes. Although this did lead to a marginal increase in accuracy for the minority classes, over-all accuracy dropped to such an extent that this weighting was not used for the results presented in this work. 5.2 Features In this section, an overview of the features used by the classifiers is given. 5.2.1 Bag-of-words feature The simplest feature used consists of looking at each lemma in the NP to be classified, and their corresponding PoS tags. We also experimented with using whole sentences as context for classification, but as this worsened results on our development data, it was not used for the evaluations later in the paper. 5.2.2 Concreteness ratings Considering that two of the categories in our tag set discriminate between concrete and non-concrete entities, we include concreteness ratings 69 Table 3: Overview of the classifiers used in the experiments. Classifier Reference Parameter settings Logistic Regression (MaxEnt) (Berger et al., 1996) l2 regularization Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1998) linear kernel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Tsuruoka et al., 2009) l2 regularization, hinge loss Bernoulli Naive Bayes (B-NB) (McCallum et al., 1998) – as a feature in the classifier (Brysbaert et al., 2013). In its original form, these ratings are quite fine-grained as they are provided with the average concreteness score given by annotators on a scale. We experimented with using different granularities of these scores as a feature. A simple binary distinction where anything with a score of c > 2.5 being represented as concrete, and c ≤ 2.5 being represented as non-concrete yielded the best results, and is used in the evaluations in this paper. 5.2.3 WordNet distances We also include a feature based on WordNet distances. In this work, we use the path distance similarity measure provided in NLTK (Bird, 2006). In essence, this measure provides a score based on the shortest path that connects the senses in a hypernym/hyponym taxonomy. First, we calculate the distance to each hypernym of every given word. These distances are then summed together for each animacy class. Taking the most frequent hypernym for each animacy class gives us the following hypernyms: person.n.01, abstrac-tion.n.06, city.n.01, time period.n.01, car.n.01, or-ganization.n.01, artifact.n.01, animal.n.01, machine.n.01, buddy.n.01. The classifier then uses whichever of these words is closest as its WordNet feature. 5.2.4 Thematic roles The use of thematic roles for animacy annotation constitutes a novel contribution from this work. Intuitively this makes sense, as e.g. agents tend to be animate. Although the GMB contains an annotation layer with thematic roles, the Switchboard corpus does not. In order to use this feature, we therefore preprocessed the latter using Boxer (Bos, 2008). We use the protoroles obtained from Boxer, namely agent, theme and patient. Although automatic annotation does not provide 100% accuracy, especially on such a particular data set, this feature proved somewhat useful (see Section 6.1.2)."]},{"title":"6 Results 6.1 Evaluation on the Switchboard corpus","paragraphs":["We employ 10-fold cross validation for the evaluations on the Switchboard corpus. All NPs were automatically extracted from the pre-processed corpus, put into random order and divided into ten equally-sized folds. In each of the ten cross validation iterations, one of these folds was left out and used for evaluation. For the sake of conciseness, averaged results over all classes are given in the comparisons of Section 6.1.1 and Section 6.1.2, whereas detailed results are only given for the best performing classifier. Note that the training data from Wordrobe is not used for the evaluations on the Switchboard corpus, as this would prohibit fair evaluation with previous work. 6.1.1 Classifier evaluation We first ran experiments to evaluate which of the classifiers performed the best on this task. Figure 2 shows the average accuracy for each classifier, using 10-fold cross validation on the Switchboard corpus. Table 4 contains the per-class results from the cross validation performed with the best performing classifier, namely the Logistic Regression classifier. The remaining evaluations in this paper are all carried out with this classifier. Average accuracy over the 10 folds was 85.8%. This is well above the baseline of always picking the most common class (HUM), which results in an accuracy of 45.3%. More interestingly, this is somewhat higher than the best results for this dataset reported in the literature (84.9% without cross validation (Bowman and Chopra, 2012)). 6.1.2 Feature evaluation Using the best performing classifier, we ran experiments to evaluate how different features affect the results.

As in all other conditions, this was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation on the Switchboard corpus. It should come as no surprise that the results are substantially below those for known words, for every single class. The average accuracy for this condition was 59.2%, which can be compared to the most frequent class (NCN) baseline at 43.0%. 6.2 Evaluation on the GMB Since one of the purposes of the development of this classifier was to include it in the tools used in the tagging of the GMB, we also present the first results in the literature for the animacy annotation of this corpus. Due to the limited size of the por-tion of this corpus for which animacy tags have been manually corrected, no cross-validation was performed. However, due to the high differences in the training data from the Switchboard corpus, and the evaluation data in the GMB, the results could be seen as a lower bound for this classifier on this data set. Table 4 contains the results from this evaluation. The accuracy on this dataset was 79.4%, which can be compared to a most frequent class baseline of 37.2%. 6.3 Excluding pronouns The discrepancy between the results obtained from the Switchboard corpus and the GMB does call for some investigation. Considering that the Switchboard corpus consists of spoken language, it contains a relatively large amount of personal pronouns compared to, e.g., news text. Taking into account that these pronouns are rarely ambiguous as far as animacy is concerned, it seems feasible that this may be why the results for the Switchboard corpus are better than those of the GMB. To evaluate this, a separate experiment was run in which all pronouns were excluded. As a large amount of pronouns are tagged as HUM, the F-scores for this class dropped by 8% and 5% for the Switchboard corpus and GMB respectively. For the GMB, results for other classes remained fairly stable, most likely due to there not being many pronouns present which affect the remaining classes. For the Switchboard corpus, however, an increase in F-score was observed for several classes. This might be explained by that the exclusion of pronouns lowered the classifier’s preexisting bias for the HUM class, as the number of annotated examples was lowered from approximately 85,000 to 15,000.","Animacy classification of pronouns can be considered trivial, as there is little or no ambiguity of that the referent of e.g. he is HUM. Even so, pronouns were included in the main results provided 71 Table 4: Results from 10-fold cross validation on the Switchboard corpus and evaluation on the GMB.

Additionally, we also present the first results in the literature for animacy classification on the GMB, allowing for future research to use this work as a point of comparison. It is, however, important to note that the results obtained for the GMB in this paper are prone to bias, as the annotation procedure was done in a semi-automatic fashion. If annotators were affected by the output of the classifier, this is likely to have improved the results presented here.","A striking factor when observing the results, is the high discrepancy in performance between the GMB and the Switchboard corpus. This is, however, not all that surprising. Considering that the Switchboard corpus consists of spoken language, and the GMB contains written language, one can easily draw the conclusion that the domain differences pose a substantial obstacle. This can, for instance, be seen in the differing vocabulary. In the cross-validation conditions for the Switchboard corpus, approximately 1% of the words to be classified in each fold are unknown to the classifier. As for the GMB, approximately 10% of the words are unknown. As mentioned in Section 6.1.2, the lemma of the head noun in an NP is a very strong feature, which naturally can not be used in the case of unknown words. As seen in Table 6, performance on known words in the GMB is not far away from that of known words in the Switchboard corpus.","Although a fairly good selection of classifiers were tested in this work, there is room for improvement in this area. The fact that the Logistic Regression classifier outperformed all other classifiers is likely to have been caused by that not enough effort was put into parameter selection for the other classifiers. More sophisticated classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Networks, ought to 72 at the very least replicate the results achieved here. Quite likely, results should even improve, seeing that the added computational power of ANNs allows us to capture more interesting/deeper statistical patterns, if they exist in the data.","The features used in this paper mainly revolved around semantically oriented ones, such as semantic relations from WordNet, thematic roles and, arguably, concreteness ratings. Better results could most likely be achieved if one also incorporated more syntactically oriented features, such as frequency counts from a dependency parsed corpus, as done by e.g. Bowman & Chopra (2012) and Øvrelid (2009). Other options include the use of more linguistically motivated features, such as exploiting relative pronouns (i.e. who vs. which)."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions and future work","paragraphs":["At the beginning of this paper, we set out three aims. Firstly, we wanted to improve upon the state of the art in multi-class animacy classification. A conclusive statement to that effect is hard to make, considering that comparison was only made directly to one previous work. However, as our performance compared to this work was somewhat higher, this work certainly marks some sort of improvement. Secondly, we aimed at investigating whether a corpus of spoken language containing animacy annotation could be used to annotate a corpus of written language. As our results for the GMB are well above the baseline, we conclude that this is indeed feasible, in spite of the disparities between language form and vocabulary. Lastly, we aimed at using the resulting classifier as a part of the toolchain used to annotate the GMB. This goal has also been met.","As for future work, the fact that animacy is marked explicitly in many languages presents a golden opportunity to alleviate the annotation of this semantic property for languages in which it is not explicitly marked. By identifying these markers, the annotation of animacy in such a language should be relatively trivial through the use of parallel texts. Alternatively, one could look at using existing annotated corpora, such as Talbanken05 (Nivre et al., 2006), as a source of annotation. One could then look at transferring this annotation to a second language. Although intuitively promising, this approach has some potential issues, as animacy is not represented universally across languages. For instance, fluid contain-ers (e.g. cups, spoons) represent a class of nouns which are considered grammatically animate in Algonquian (Quinn, 2001). Annotating such items as animate in English would most likely not be considered correct, neither by native speakers nor by most experts. Nevertheless, if a sufficiently large amount of languages have some manner of consensus as to where a given entity is in an animacy hierarchy, this problem ought to be solvable by simply hand-picking such languages. 73"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Kirk Baker and Chris Brew. 2010.
