We present an approach for translation into a compounding language that splits compounds into simple words for training and, due to an underspecified representation, allows for free merging of simple words into compounds after translation. In contrast to previous approaches, we use features projected from the source language to predict compound mergings. We integrate our approach into end-to-end SMT and show that many compounds matching the reference translation are produced which did not appear in the training data. Additional manual evaluations support the usefulness of generalizing compound formation in SMT."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Productive processes like compounding or inflection are problematic for traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches, because words can only be translated as they have occurred in the parallel training data. As parallel training data is limited, it is desirable to extract as much information from it as possible. We present an approach for compound processing in SMT, translating from English to German, that splits compounds prior to training (in order to access the individual words which together form the compound) and recombines them after translation. While compound splitting is a well-studied task, compound merging has not received as much attention in the past. We start from Stymne and Cancedda (2011), who used sequence models to predict compound merging and Fraser et al. (2012) who, in addition, generalise over German inflection. Our new contributions are: (i) We project features from the source language to support compound merging predictions. As the source language input is fluent, these features are more reliable than features derived from target language SMT output. (ii) We reduce compound parts to an underspecified representation which allows for maximal generalisation. (iii) We present a detailed manual evaluation methodology which shows that we obtain improved compound translations.","We evaluated compound processing both on held-out split data and in end-to-end SMT. We show that using source language features increases the accuracy of compound generation. Moreover, we find more correct compounds than the baselines, and a considerable number of these compounds are unseen in the training data. This is largely due to the underspecified representation we are using. Finally, we show that our approach improves upon the previous work.","We discuss compound processing in SMT in Section 2, and summarise related work in Section 3. In Section 4 we present our method for splitting compounds and reducing the component words to an underspecified representation. The merging to obtain German compounds is the subject of Section 5. We evaluate the accuracy of compound prediction on held-out data in Section 6 and in end-to-end SMT experiments in Section 7. We conclude in Section 8."]},{"title":"2 Dealing with Compounds in SMT","paragraphs":["In German, two (or more) single words (usually nouns or adjectives) are combined to form a compound which is considered a semantic unit. The rightmost part is referred to as the head while all other parts are called modifiers. EXAMPLE (1) lists different ways of joining simple words into compounds: mostly, no modification is required (A) or a filler letter is introduced (B). More rarely, a letter is deleted (C), or transformed (D). 579 Werkzeug Handel Obst Kiste fruit box trading tool Handelswerkzeug ObstkisteWerkzeugkiste Obsthandel fruit trading tool boxKiste Werkzeug Obst Handel splitting training splitting training testing re−combination testing re−combination Figure 1: Compound processing in SMT allows the synthesis of compounds unseen in the training data. EXAMPLE (1) (A) Haus+Boot = Hausboot (“house boat”) (B) Ort+s+Zeit = Ortszeit (“local time”) (C) Kirche-e+Turm = Kirchturm (“church tower”) (D) Kriterium+Liste = Kriterienliste (“criteria list”) German compounds are highly productive,1","and traditional SMT approaches often fail in the face of such productivity. Therefore, special processing of compounds is required for translation into German, as many compounds will not (e.g. Hausboot, “house boat”) or only rarely have been seen in the training data.2","In contrast, most compounds consist of two (or more) simple words that occur more frequently in the data than the compound as a whole (e.g. Haus (7,975) and Boot (162)) and often, these compound parts can be translated 1-to-1 into simple English words. Figure 1 illustrates the basic idea of compound processing in SMT: imagine, “Werkzeug” (“tool”) occurred only as a modifier of e.g. “Kiste” (“box”) in the training data, but the test set contains “tool” as a simple word or as the head of a compound. Splitting compounds prior to translation model training enables better access to the component translations and allows for a high degree of generalisation. At testing time, the English text is translated into the split German representation, and only afterwards, some sequences of simple words are (re-)combined into (possibly unseen) compounds where appropriate. This merging of compounds is much more challenging than the splitting, as it has to be applied to disfluent MT output: i.e., compound parts may not occur in the correct word order and even if they do, not all sequences of German words that could form a compound should be merged."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Compound processing for translation into a com-","pounding language includes both compound split-1 Most newly appearing words in German are compounds. 2 ~30% of the word types and ~77% of the compound","types we identified in our training data occurred≤ 3 times. ting and merging, we thus report on previous approaches for both of these tasks.","In the past, there have been numerous attempts to split compounds, all improving translation quality when translating from a compounding to a non-compounding language. Several compound splitting approaches make use of substring corpus frequencies in order to find the optimal split points of a compound (e.g. Koehn and Knight (2003), who allowed only “(e)s” as filler letters). Stymne et al. (2008) use Koehn and Knight’s technique, include a larger list of possible modifier transformations and apply POS restrictions on the substrings, while Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) use a morphological analyser to find only linguistically motivated substrings. In contrast, Dyer (2010) presents a lattice-based approach to encode different segmentations of words (instead of finding the one-best split). More recently, Macherey et al. (2011) presented a language-independent unsupervised approach in which filler letters and a list of words not to be split (e.g., named entities) are learned using phrase tables and Levenshtein distance.","In contrast to splitting, the merging of compounds has received much less attention in the past. An early approach by Popović et al. (2006) recombines compounds using a list of compounds and their parts. It thus never creates invalid German compounds, but on the other hand it is limited to the coverage of the list. Moreover, in some contexts a merging in the list may still be wrong, cf. EXAMPLE (3) in Section 5 below. The approach of Stymne (2009) makes use of a factored model, with a special POS-markup for compound modifiers, derived from the POS of the whole compound. This markup enables sound mergings of compound parts after translation if the POS of the candidate modifier (X-Part) matches the POS of the candidate compound head (X): Inflations |N-Part + Rate|N = Inflationsrate |N (“inflation rate”).

Besides the words and their POS, many different target language frequency features were defined to train the CRF. This approach can even produce new compounds unseen in the training data, provided that the modifiers occurred in modifier position of a compound and heads occurred as heads or even as simple words with the same inflectional endings. However, as former compound modifiers were left with their filler letters (cf. “Inflations ” ), they can not be generalised to compound heads or simple words, nor can inflectional variants of compound heads or simple words be created (e.g. if “Rate” had only been observed in nominative form in the training data, the genitive “Raten” could not be produced). The underspecified representation we are using allows for maximal generalisation over word parts independent of their position of occurrence or inflectional realisations. Moreover, their experiments were limited to predicting compounds on held-out data; no results were reported for using their approach in translation. In Fraser et al. (2012) we re-implemented the approach of Stymne and Cancedda (2011), combined it with inflection prediction and applied it to a translation task. However, compound merging was restricted to a list of compounds and parts. Our present work facilitates more independent combination. Toutanova et al. (2008) and Weller et al. (2013) used source language features for target language inflection, but to our knowledge, none of these works applied source language features for compound merging."]},{"title":"4 Step 1: Underspecified Representation","paragraphs":["In order to enhance translation model accuracy, it is reasonable to have similar degrees of morphological richness between source and target language. We thus reduce the German target language training data to an underspecified representation: we split compounds, and lemmatise all words (except verbs). All occurrences of simple words, former compound modifiers or heads have the same representation and can thus be freely merged into “old” and “new” compounds after translation, cf. Figure 1 above. So that we can later predict the merging of simple words into compounds and the inflection of the words, we store all of the morphological information stripped from the underspecified representation.","Note that erroneous over-splitting might make the correct merging of compounds difficult3 (or even impossible), due to the number of correct decisions required. For example, it requires only 1 correct prediction to recombine “Niederschlag |Menge” into “Niederschlagsmenge” (“amount of precipitation”) but 3 for the wrong split into “nie |der|Schlag|Menge” (“never |the|hit|amount”). We use the compound splitter of Fritzinger and Fraser (2010), who have shown that using a rule-based morphological analyser (SMOR, Schmid et al. (2004)) drastically reduced the number of erroneous splits when compared to the frequency-based approach of Koehn and Knight (2003). However, we adapted it to work on tokens: some words can, depending on their context, either be interpreted as named entities or common nouns, e.g., “Dinkelacker” (a German beer brand or “spelt |field”).4","We parsed the training data and use the parser’s decisions to identify proper names, see “Baumeister” in Figure 2.","After splitting, we use SMOR to reduce words to lemmas, keeping morphological features like gender or number, and stripping features like case, as illustrated for “ Ölexporteure” (“oil exporters”): 3","In contrast, they may not hurt translation quality in the other direction, where phrase-based SMT is likely to learn the split words as a phrase and thus recover from that error. 4","Note that Macherey et al. (2011) blocked splitting of words which can be used as named entities, independent of context, which is less general than our solution. 581 No. Feature Description Example Experiment","SC T TR 1SC surface form of the word string: Arbeit<+NN><Fem><Sg> X X 2SC main part of speech of the word (from the parser) string: +NN X X 3SC word occurs in a bigram with the next word frequency: 0 X X 4SC word combined to a compound with the next word frequency: 10,000 X X X 5SC word occurs in modifier position of a compound frequency: 100,000 X X 6SC word occurs in a head position of a compound frequency: 10,000 X X 7SC word occurs in modifier position vs. simplex string: P>W (P= 5SC, W= 100,000) X 8SC word occurs in head position vs. simplex string: S<W (S= 6SC, W= 100,000) X 7SC+ word occurs in modifier position vs. simplex ratio: 10 (10**ceil(log10(5SC/W))) X X 8SC+ word occurs in head position vs. simplex ratio: 1 (10**ceil(log10(6SC/W))) X X 9N different head types the word can combine with number: 10,000 X X Table 1: Target language CRF features for compound merging.

We need to ensure that the representation of the modifier is identical to the same word when it occurs independently in order to obtain full generalisation over compound parts."]},{"title":"5 Step 2: Compound Merging","paragraphs":["After translation from English into the underspecified German representation, post-processing is required to transform the output back into fluent, morphologically fully specified German. First, compounds need to be merged where appropriate, e.g., “Hausboote” (“house boats”): Haus<+NN><Neut><Sg> + Boot<+NN><Neut><Pl> → Haus<NN>Boot<+NN><Neut><Pl> (merged) and second, all words need to be inflected: Haus<NN>Boot<+NN><Neut><Acc><Pl> → Hausbooten (inflected) 5.1 Target Language Features To decide which words should be combined, we follow Stymne and Cancedda (2011) who used CRFs for this task. The features we derived from the target language to train CRF models are listed in Table 1. We adapted features No. 1-8 from Stymne and Cancedda (2011). Then, we modified two features (7+8) and created a new feature indicating the productivity of a modifier (9N). 5.2 Projecting Source Language Features We also use new features derived from the English source language input, which is coherent and fluent. This makes features derived from it more reli-able than the target language features derived from disfluent SMT output. Moreover, source language features might support or block merging decisions in unclear cases, i.e., where target language frequencies are not helpful, either because they are very low or they have roughly equal frequency distributions when occurring in a compound (as modifier or head) vs. as a simple word. In Table 2, we list three types of features: 1. Syntactic features: different English noun","phrase patterns that are aligned to German","compound candidate words (cf. 10E-13E) 2. The POS tag of the English word (cf. 14E) 3. Alignment features, derived from word","alignments (cf. 15E-18E) The examples given in Table 2 (10E-13E) show that English compounds often have 1-to-1 correspondences to the parts of a German compound. Knowing that two consecutive German simple words are aligned to two English words of the same noun phrase is a strong indicator that the German words should be merged: EXAMPLE (3) should be merged: ein erhöhtes verkehrs aufkommen sorgt für chaos “an increased traffic volume causes chaos” (S...(NP(DT An)(VN increased)(NN traffic)(NN volume))..))) should not be merged: für die finanzierung desverkehrs aufkommen “ pay for the financing oftransport” (VP(V pay)(PP(IN for)(NP(NP(DT the)(NN financing)) (PP(IN of)(NP(NN transport)..)) In the compound reading of “verkehr + aufkommen” , the English parse structure indicates that the words aligned to “verkehr” (“traffic”) and 582 No. Feature Description Type 10E word and next word are aligned from a noun phrase in the English source sentence:","(NP(NN traffic)(NN accident))→ Verkehr (“traffic”) + Unfall (“accident”) true/false 11E word and next word are aligned from a gerund construction in the English source sentence:","(NP(VBG developing)(NNS nations)) → Entwicklung (“development”) + Länder (“countries”) true/false 12E word and next word are aligned from a genitive construction in the English source sentence:","(NP(NP(DT the)(NN end))(PP(IN of)(NP(DT the)(NN year)) → Jahr (“year”) + Ende(“end”) true/false 13E word and next word are aligned from an adjective noun construction in the English source sentence:","(NP (ADJ protective)(NNS measures)) → Schutz (“protection”) + Maßnahmen (“measures”) true/false 14E print the POS of the corresponding aligned English word string 15E word and next word are aligned 1-to-1 from the same word in the English source sentence, e.g.,","beef↗","↘ Rind(“cow”) Fleisch(“meat”) true/false","16E like 15E, but the English word contains a dash, e.g., Nobel − P rize↗ ↘","Nobel(“Nobel”)","Preis(“prize”) true/false","17E like 15E, but also considering 1-to-n and n-to-1 links true/false","18E like 16E, but also considering 1-to-n and n-to-1 links true/false Table 2: List of new source language CRF features for compound merging. “aufkommen” (“volume”), are both nouns and part of one common noun phrase, which is a strong indicator that the two words should be merged in German. In contrast, the syntactic relationship between “pay” (aligned to “aufkommen” ) and “transport” (aligned to “verkehr” ) is more distant5",": merging is not indicated.","We also use the POS of the English words to learn (un)usual combinations of POS, independent of their exact syntactic structure (14E). Reconsider EXAMPLE (3): NN+NN is a more common POS pair for compounds than V+NN.","Finally, the alignment features (15E-18E) promote the merging into compounds whose alignments indicate that they should not have been split in the first place (e.g.,Rindfleisch , 15E). 5.3 Compound Generation and Inflection So far, we reported on how to decide which simple words are to be merged into compounds, but not how to recombine them. Recall from EXAMPLE (1) that the modifier of a compound some-times needs to be transformed, before it can be combined with the head word (or next modifier), e.g., “Ort” +“Zeit” = “Ort szeit” (“local time”).","We use SMOR to generate compounds from a combination of simple words. This allows us to create compounds with modifiers that never occurred as such in the training data. Imagine that “Ort” occurred only as compound head or as a single word in the training data. Using SMOR, we are still able to create the correct form of the modifier, including the required filler letter: “Ort s” . This ability distinguishes our approach from pre-5 Note that “f ür etwas aufkommen” (lit. “for sth. arise”,","idiom.: “to pay for sth.”) is an idiomatic expression. vious approaches: Stymne and Cancedda (2011) do not reduce modifiers to their base forms6","(they can only create new compounds when the modifier occurred as such in the training data) and Fraser et al. (2012) use a list for merging.","Finally, we use the system described in Fraser et al. (2012) to inflect the entire text."]},{"title":"6 Accuracy of Compound Prediction","paragraphs":["We trained CRF models on the parallel training data (~40 million words)7","of the EACL 2009 workshop on statistical machine translation8","using different feature (sub)sets, cf. the “Experiment” column in Table 1 above.

This way, the training data was less fluent than in its original format, but still of higher quality than SMT output of unseen data.

We thus performed two additional manual evaluations and show that the quality of the compounds (Section 7.2), and the human perception of translation quality is improving (Section 7.3). 7.2 Detailed Evaluation of Compounds This evaluation focuses on how compounds in the the reference text have been translated.10","We:","10","In another evaluation, we investigated the 519 compounds that our system produced but which did not match the reference: 367 were correct translations of the English,","1. manually identify compounds in German reference text (1,105 found)","2. manually perform word alignment of these compounds to the English source text","3. project these English counterparts of compounds in the reference text to the decoded text using the “–print-alignment-info” flag","4. manually annotate the resulting tuples, using the categories given in Table 5 The results are given in the two rightmost columns of Table 5: besides a higher number of reference matches (cf. row 1a), STR overall produces more compounds than the UNSPLIT baseline, cf. rows 2a, 3a and 4a. Indirectly, this can also be seen from the low numbers of STR in category 2b), where the UNSPLIT baseline produces much more (101 vs. 54) translations that lexically match the reference without being a compound. While the 171 compounds of STR of category 3a) show that our system produces many compounds that are correct translations of the English, even though not matching the reference (and thus not credited by BLEU), the compounds of categories 2a) and 4a) contain examples where we either fail to reproduce the correct compound or over-generate compounds.","We give some examples in Table 6: for “teddy bear”, the correct German word “Teddyb ären” is 87 contained erroneous lexemes and 65 were over-mergings. 585 missing in the parallel training data and instead of “B är” (“bear”), the baseline selected “tragen” (“to bear”). Extracting all words containing the substring “b är” (“bear”) from the original parallel training data and from its underspecified split version demonstrates that our approach is able to access all occurrences of the word. This leads to higher frequency counts and thus enhances the probabilities for correct translations. We can generalise over 18 different word types containing “bear” (e.g. “polar bears”, “brown bears”, “bear skin”, “bear fur”) to obtain only 2: occurrences in raw training data: Bär (19), Bären (26), Bärendienst (42), Bärenfarmen (1), Bärenfell (2), Bärengalle(1), Bärenhaut (1), Bärenmarkt (1), Braunbär (1), Braunbären (3), Braunbärengebiete (1), Braunbär-Population (1), Eisbären(18), Eisbärenpopulation (2), Eisbärenpopulationen (1), Schwarzbär (1), Schwarzbären (1) “bär” occurring in underspecified split data: Bär<+NN><Masc><Sg> (94) Bär<+NN><Masc><Pl> (29) “Emissionsverringerung” (cf. Table 6) is a typical example of group 3a): a correctly translated compound that does not lexically match the reference, but which is semantically very similar to the reference. The same applies for “Bußgeld” , a synonym of “Geldstrafe” , for which the UNSPLIT baseline selected “sch önen” (“fine, nice”) instead. Consider also the wrong compound productions, e.g. “Tischtennis” is combined with the verb “spielen” (“to play”) into “Spieltischtennis” . In contrast, “Kreditmarkt” dropped the middle part “Karte” (“card”), and in the case of “Temporotation” , the head and modifier of the compound are switched. 7.3 Human perception of translation quality We presented sentences of the UNSPLIT baseline and of STR in random order to two native speakers of German and asked them to rank the sentences according to preference. In order to prevent them from being biased towards compound-bearing sentences, we asked them to select sentences based on their native intuition, without revealing our focus on compound processing.","Sentences were selected based on source language sentence length: 10-15 words (178 sentences), of which either the reference or our system had to contain a compound (95 sentences). After removing duplicates, we ended up with 84 sentences to be annotated in two subse- (a) Fluency: without reference sentence κ = 0.3631 person 1","STR UNSPLIT equal person","2 STR 24 6 7 37 UNSPLIT 5 16 9 30 equal 6 2 9 17","35 24 25 84 (b) Adequacy: with reference sentence κ = 0.4948 person 1","STR UNSPLIT equal person","2 STR 23 4 5 32 UNSPLIT 4 21 7 32 equal 5 3 12 20","32 28 24 84 Table 7: Human perception of translation quality. quent passes: first, without being given the reference sentence (approximating fluency), then, with the reference sentence (approximating adequacy). The results are given in Table 7. Both annotators preferred more sentences of our system overall, but the difference is clearer for the fluency task."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Compounds require special attention in SMT, especially when translating into a compounding language. Compared with the baselines, all of our experiments that included compound processing produced not only many more compounds matching the reference exactly, but also many compounds that did not occur in the training data. Taking a closer look, we found that some of these new compounds could only be produced due to the underspecified representation we are using, which allows us to generalise over occurrences of simple words, compound modifiers and heads. Moreover, we demonstrated that features derived from the source language are a valuable source of information for compound prediction: experiments were significantly better compared with contrastive experiments without these features. Additional manual evaluations showed that compound processing leads to improved translations where the improvement is not captured by BLEU."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported by Deutsche For-schungsgemeinschaft grants Models of Morphosyntax for Statistical Machine Translation (Phase 2) and Distributional Approaches to Semantic Relatedness.
