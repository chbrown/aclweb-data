We formulate and justify a heuristic for the selection of optional deep case slots not contained in the question as candidates for the additional information contained in an extended response. It is shown that, in a visually present domain of discourse, case role filling for the construction of an extended response can be regarded as a side effect of the visual search necessary to answer a question containing a locomotion verb. The paper describes the various representation constructions used in the German language dialog system HAM-ANS for dealing with the semantics of locomotion verbs and illustrates their use in generating extended responses. In particular, we outline the structure of the geometrical scene description, the representation of events in a logic-oriented semantic representation language, the case-frame lexicon and the representation of the referential semantics based on the Flavor system. The emphasis is on a detailed presentation of the application of object-oriented programming methods for coping with the semantics of locomotion verbs. The process of generating an extended response is illus-. trated by an extensively annotated trace."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Frequently a questioner expects more than a direct, literal response although he must assume that the answerer is not informed about what particular information he is seeking. The questioner imputes to a cooperative dialogue partner the communicative competence to reply to a simple yes-no question like (I) with an extended response (cf. (12], (11]) like (la) rather than with a simple Yes. (I) Are you going to travel this summer? (la) Yes, to Sicily. In the absence of special information about the previous course of the dialog or the intentions of the questioner (the unmarked case) an answer like (la) seems more appropriate than (Ib) or (Ic). (Ib) Yes, with an old school friend. (Ic) Yes, by plane. OF course, there are numerous dialog situatlons in which (lb) os\" (lc) could be generated as a communicatively adequate response on the basis of a par. t±cular partner model. But it still must b~ asked why in dialogs of the type 'information ,upply' the unmarked response takes the form (la) ~nd not (lh) or (lc). In this paper we will present the results of a computational study of this problem for the domain Research on HAM..ANS Is currently being supported by the German Ministry of Research and Technology (8MFT) under contract 081T15038 'locomotion verbs' in dialogs based on a visually present world of discourse. This question is particularly important for the construction of cooperative dialo 9 systems, since, in many applications, no explicit knowledge about the dialog goals of the questioner is available at the outset. If a,system is nevertheless expected to 'over-answer , i.e. to volunteer information that has not specifically been requested, it must command a set of heuristic criteria for selecting the additional information that is to be verbalized [111. It is noteworthy that the three additional points of information in (la), (lb), (1c) correspond to filled deep case slots of the verb used in the question (GOAL, CO-AGENT and INSTRUMENT, respectively). This suggests that the unfilled optional case slots in the question are candidates for additional information. For a question like (2), in which all the deep case slots of 'break' are filled, only a direct response like (2a) is to be expected as a positive answer, while in (3), where only the obligatory deep case slots are filled, an extended response like (3a) can be expected. (2) Did you break the window with your slingshot","yesterday? (2a) Yes. (3) Did you break the window? (3a) Yes, with my slingshot. Since not every optional deep case of a given verb unspecified in the question is suitable for an unmarked extended response (e.g. (la)-(lc)) we may define the problem more precisely by asking which of the deep case slots unspecified in the question are to be chosen as the unmarked values. For our domain Of investigation 'locomotion verbs' let us consider questions (4) and (5), which refer to a visually present world of discourse. In each case perceptual processes are assumed as a prerequisite for the answer. 4) Which vehicle stopped? &a) The bus, on Hartungstreet. 4b) The bus, because the driver stepped on the","brake. 5) Did the bus turn off? 5a) Yes, from Hartungstreet onto Schlueterstteet. 5b) Yes, together with the taxi cab. The instantiation of the iocatlve slot in answer (4a) and the source and goal slots in (Sa) is predictable in contrast to the causative slot in (4b) and the co agent slot in (5b). As examples (4) and (5) demonstrate, the same optional deep case slot is not always selected as the unmarked option. The choice is dependent upon the verb contained in the question. Moreover, {Sa) shows that combinations of deep cases are possible in unmarked extended responses, In the area under investigation here, the following heuristic carl be employed to determine the 188"]},{"title":"FAMILIAR WITH SCENE BUT CANNOT SEE IT PDP-IO NL DIALOG SYSTEM HAM ANS IMAGE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM NAOS MORIO ] IL STREET INTERSECTION","paragraphs":["Fig. 1: Situational context of the dialog selection of the deep case slots for an um~marked extended response: Select the deep case slots which contain the concepts necessary for the perceptual verification of the motion descrlbed by the verb. In order to verify a stop-event it is necessary to determine the end point of the motion (Cf. (4a)) but not the cause (cf. (4b)). For a turn-off event a change of direction between source and goal must be established (cf. (Sa)). It is not essential to determine whether other objects make this change of direction at the same time (cf. (Sb)). Hence case role filling for the construction of an extended response can be regarded as a side effect of the visual, search necessary to answer the question. This also appears plausible when seen in the light of the beliefs that the questioner imputes to the answerer. The questioner believes that the answerer will fill in the case sluts necessary for answering the question and that it is therefore unnecessary to explicitly mention these in the question. Additionally the questioner believes that the answerer believes that the questioner expects an extended reply and fur this reason did not explicitly request the additional information. A cooperative dialog system fulfills this user expectation by applying the heuristic formulated above. A prerequisite for the application of this heuristic is that [he system have knowledge about which deep case slots are relevant for the verification OF a movem~mt. This prerequisite is not met by most natural language (NL) systems since they simply represent events in the domain or discourse in fully instant~ated Form using case frames, e.g. as part of a semantic net or frame hierarchy. In contrast, the G,,rman language dialog system HAM-ANS (Hamburg application--oriented natural language system) [6], which we have developed, can apply this heuris(~c because in addition to the case frame of each verb the system includes a representation of the referential semantics of predications associated with that verb which makes it possible to ~valuate the ViSual input data for the movement in question. The goal of this article is to elucidate the representation constructions for case frames and referential semantics of verbs of motion used in HAM-ANS and to illustrate their use in generating unmarked extended responses."]},{"title":"2. A SHORT OVERVIEW OF HA~-ANS","paragraphs":["HAM-ANS is a large German natural language dialog system of both considerable depth and breadth which presently provides access to three different application classes, namely an expert system (hotel reservation situation), a database system (fishery data) and a scene analysis system (traffic scene). The communicative situations the system handles are characterized as follows: In the hotel reservation situation the system takes the role of a hotel manager, who tries to persuade the user to book a room. The caller is assumed to have the overall goal of determining whether the room offered meets his requirements. The system must attempt to recognize the user s specific desires concerning the room as they are revealed - usually indirectly - in his utterances and to make use of the various devices available in natural language that permit the room in question to be presented in a particularly favorable light (e.g. the generation of tendentious descriptions using hedged relative adjectives). In the database application [8] HAM-ANS provides marine scientists with NL access to a fishery database, which contains data collected during international expeditions in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. The complex structured data sets, which consist of cruise data concerning the vessels' voyages , krill biology data, relevant net hauls and oceanographic data, are stored in a relational database (76 relations. 11MByte) with a PASCAL/R data base management system.

From these 360 lmages 72 snapshots are coded in a relational formalism, denotlng which objects were observed, the shape of these objects, their current center of gravity and some other properties (e.g. color). The represen - ration of the first snapshot contains information about all objects that are visible at that time. For the successive snapshots only changes with respect to the predecessors are recorded, i.e. objects and their descriptions are only entered if they have changed location or appeared in the scene. A trajectory of an object is determined by its different centers of gravity relative to an underlying coordinate system. In contrast to the real TV image sequence this representation is only 2 dimensional and thus provides a bird's-eye view of the scene."]},{"title":"3.2. THE REPRESENTATION LANGUAGES SURF AND DEEP","paragraphs":["The logic-oriented semantic representation languages SURF and DEEP are the central representation formalisms used in HAM-ANS. These languages are designed to be declarative and easily extendable. SURF is the target language of the analysis components and source language for the generation components and thus as close as possible to NL utterances, whereas DEEP is better suited for the evaluation of utterances on the basis of the system's domain-specific knowledge sources. Originally SURF and DEEP were designed to represent term and predicate structures which serve as a representation formalism for state descriptions occurring typically in the hotel reservation situation. For an adequate representation of the semantics of questions containing verbs, the definition of SURF and DEEP was augmented by meta-predicates for marking deep cases, tense and voice adapted from Fillmore's deep case theory [3]. Since events can be existentially quantlfied as in (6) or explicitly quantified as in (7) (6) Did ]ohn fly to Hamburg? (7) Did John fly to Hamburg three times last week? SURF and DEEP provide a means of representing quantification of events. A special quantifier E-ACT denotes an existential quantification of events. Other quantifiers like those in (7) are currently not available but can easily be included. Examples of SURF and DEEP expressions are shown in the annotated example (cf. fig. 8). In this paper only some of the features of SURF and DEEP are discussed, see [6] for a more detailed description."]},{"title":"3.3. THE CASE-FRAME LEXICON","paragraphs":["The case frames for verbs used in the system are stored in the"]},{"title":"case-frame lexicon","paragraphs":["[5]. Each entry in the word lexicon for a verb contains a pointer to its applicable case frame which describes the semantics of that verb in terms of case relations. A case frame is represented as a combination of deep case descriptions specifying for each deep case its name, a marker, whether the deep case is obligatory (0) or optional (F), and the semantic restrictions which are required from a syntactic substructure to fill the deep case (of. fig. 3). This pointer technique permits the use of a specific case frame for several verbs during the analysis phase without predetermining a single process for these verbs during the evaluation of whole utterances. For verbs with different referential semantics, e.g. 'to accelerate' and 'to stop', a single case frame, namely that specitying an obligatory AGENT of type 'vehicle' and a optional LOCATIVE of type 'thoroughfare', is applied during the analysis phase. Case frames are formulated in SURF so that the checking of the semantic restrictions can be accomplished by the inference rules usually applied during the evaluation of a complete utter-- ance; The selectional restriction that, e.g., the NP a car' describe an object of the class of vehicles, and therefore be a possible candidate to fill ~ the agent role of the verb 'to stop', can be 190 verified because of the transitivity of the super-set relation in the conceptual semantic net.

OB3ECT-ORZENTEB REPRESENTATION OF MOTION CONCEPTS","paragraphs":["In object-oriented programming languages programming is more or less the activity of creating a world of entities called objects and of specifying a set of generic operations that can be performed on them• Objects can communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Essentially, running a program means that the object sends a message to ar, object (possibly to itself) which in turn sends a message etc., until the required task is fulfilled. An important benefit of the object-oriented style is that it lends itself to a particularly simple and lucid kind of modularity."]},{"title":"3.4.1. THE FLAVOR SYSTEM","paragraphs":["The Flavor system [2] [13] is an implementation of the language features that support object-oriented programming. Two kinds of objects exist in a Flavor system, namely one called flavor and the other instance of a flavor. A flavor represents a generic object and an instance an individual realiza-tion of a ge,~eric object. It is possible to send messages to both kinds of objects. Flavors are organized in ,, directed graph called the flavor graph• There is one designated flavor, the vanilla flays, r, which corresponds to the thing frame in FRL [I0]. Since the heritage of information for each flavor is provided by the flavor graph, it zs necessary to specify for each newly defined flavor its location in the graph by naming its direct predecessors (its superflavors). The information contained in a flavor is a combination of all the information inherited from its superflavors and the added information given by its own definition. The added information can also override, augment or modify the inherited information. This is one dimension of the information contained in a flavor: owned or inherited. Another is the declarative/procedural distinction. The declarative knowle~tge of a Flavor is stored in variables of different kinds whereas procedural knowledge is encoded in so called methods• One kind of variable the instance variable - is used to give instances of the same generic object their individual information. The other kind - the class variable is owned by a flavor, can be 'bequeathed' to other flavors, and accessed by any object in the flavor system. However, a flavor is only allowed to change a value of a class variable, if it owns this variable. Methods are function definitions that implement the operations defined for each flavor. The combination of methods from different flavors is called mixing flavors. In comparison with FRL the Flavor system has mainly three distinguishing features: The 'A kind of' slot in FRL serves both for establishing an inheritance hierarchy and for connecting instances to superclasses, i.e. no clear distinction is made between generic frames and instances• On the other hand the flavor graph is built by specifying the superflavors for each flavor, instances are created by the make-instance-method. Because the distinction between generic frames and instances is not made in FRL there is also no distinction between instance variables and class variables• In the Flavor system the semantics of variables is more clearly defined in that instance variables can only be modified in instances and class variables can only be modified in flavors• Frames in FRL are passive data structures, whereas flavors can be (re-)activated, created and modified; they are autonomous; they are declarative and procedural at the same time and hence are entities which are better suited for as formalisms for representing common knowledge (cf. [2]). Although the flavor system is a tool for the development of large software systems and not a knowledge representation language, it includes the basic concepts for the rapid design of specific knowledge representation formalisms. In contrast to a full-fledged knowledge representation language this approach requires some additional programming in the beginning, but it avoids any permanent overhead for features which are superfluous for the task at hand•"]},{"title":"3.4.2.

The other is a case-driven analysis strategy which is used for sentences containing verbs with an associated case frame. Since in the example the verb 'to go by' has a case frame the second strategy is applied. After an access to the case-frame lexicon the case frame is constructed. This case frame is used to guide the parsing in the following manner: The al@orithm first attempts to recognize those syntactic constituents that are possible candidates for a deep case marked obligatory, and then to recognize those constituents that are possible candidates for optional deep cases. When the input is completely consumed and all obligatory deep cases are filled the process ends. The test for determining if a syntactic constituent is a possible candidate to fill a specific deep case is divided into a syntactic and a semantic check. The syntactic check requires, e.g., that in order to fill the agent role a constituent must contain the attribute 'nominative' (sentence in active voice) and that its number must correspond to that of the verb. The semantic check requires that the noun of the constituent fulfill the semantic restrictions specified for the specific deep case. This is accomplished through the building of a SURF expression for the constituent, the transformation of this expression into a DEEP expression, and the evaluation of the DEEP expression on the basis of the conceptual net. In our example only the agent case is marked as obligatory and the noun phrase 'which trucks' fulfills both the syntactic and semantic requirements to fill this slot. Since no other syntactic constituents are encountered, the complete SURF representation is constructed. The structure is normalized into a DEEP structure. One of the maln tasks or this process is the determination of the scope of quantifiers. The algorithm used for this purpose is modelled after the one described by Hendrix [4]; it takes into account the relative strength of natural language quantifiers (e.g. 'a', 'both') and question opera-- tots (e.g. 'which' 'how many ). The strength is determined by a numeric value, which in some cases is modified by the degree of generality of the noun. E.g. the existential quantifier 'a' is weaker than the more specific (luantifier 'both'."]},{"title":"193","paragraphs":["?

The task of evaluating a OEEP formula is governed by a generate and test strategy. Generate and test procedures can De viewed as being activated by pattern-directed invocation and differ from each other in that the generate procedures assign internal object identifiers to variables in DEEP formulas, while the test procedures yield two values, the first of which is either a fully instantiated formula equivalent to the input formula or a modified formula, and the second of which indicates the truth value of the input formula in the range [0,1]. In the interpretation phase these two processes interact in such a way that a test attempt activates generate procedures which in turn call test procedures and so on. A closer look at our example shows that after the first test attempt has discovered a structure containing a variable in this case the term representing the noun phrase 'which trucks' - a package of generate procedures is activated to produce the set of object identifiers denoting the referential set of objects that are trucks - here TRUCK1 and TRUCK2. The rest of the formula is then recursively sent to a test process with the variable 'w14' replaced by elements of the reference set for trucks one after the other. The next formula to be tested requires the generation of a set of instances of the type GO_BY. Since events are not represented in fully instantiated form but rather must be extracted from the geometrical scene description, a special set of procedures - the methods specified in the verb flavor hierarchy - is activated. (See section 3.4.2 for how this process functions,) A verification of an event GO BY is possible only for TRUCK2. The additional ~nformation extracted durin 9 the process of visual search - the specific location of the event - is recorded in the locative slot. During the formation of the result of the evaluation, the system, guided by general heuristics, decides whether the additional detail will cause too ~reat a complexity in the answer or not [11]. In this case the complexity is suitable and the location will be mentioned in the answer. The word 'which' is defined as quantifier that causes a description of a set of objects to be returned (instead of a truth value). Thus the set of reference objects for which the proposition in question could be verified, i.e. TRUCK2, is substituted for the noun phrase 'which trucks'. The resulting DEEP expression is transformed by the inverse normalization process into a SURF expression. In order to verbalize extended responses in a manner both informative and concise as possible, the ellipsis generation process elides those parts of the semantic representation of complete responses that are identical to the stored representation of the question [?]. The verbalization component produces a string of canonical words and their grammatical features using translation rules attached to the various categories of SURF expressions, A special subcomponent provides for the generation of noun phrases as descriptions of domain individuals, in our example TRUCK2. In this case the NP-generator decides not to generate a definite description since neither the system nor the user has already referred to TRUCK2 in the previous dialog and the existence of TRUCK2 as a moving ob3ect is not implied by the existential assumptions supplied by the a priori user model (cf. [?]). Instead, the indefinite NP a light-colored truck' is generated, using the property 'light-colored' as an initial characterization. Finally the \"surface transformation' component [1] pronominalizes the noun 'truck' and yields a standard word order of the utterance and the correctly inflected forms of the canonical words."]},{"title":"5. CONCLUSZON","paragraphs":["We have attempted to show that case role filling for the construction of an unmarked extended response can be regarded as a side effect of the visual search necessary to answer questions referring to a visually present domain of discourse. A new method for the representation of the referential semantics associated with locomotion verbs has been presented in the framework of object-oriented programming based on the Fla.vor system. The approach presented has been useful in extending the communicative capabilities of the dialog system HAM-AN$ as an interface to a vision system."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["[1] [z] [32 [4] [5] [s] [7] [e] [9] [10] (11] [12] (13] BUSEMANN, S.: Problems involving the automatic generation of utterances in German.
