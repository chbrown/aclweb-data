The operations are reduced to functions of a fo~al language, thus changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on SI-Nets. In this sense, operations on SI-Nets are not merely isomorphic to single epistemologleal objects, but can be viewed as a simulation of processes on a different level, that pertaining to the conceptual system of NL. For this purpose, we have designed a version of KL-ONE which represents the eplstemologlcal level, while the new experimental language, KL-Conc, represents the conceptual level. KL-Conc would seem to be a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with SI-Nets. I GOALS","The goal of our work is to interpret conceptual operations underlying the communicative use of natural language within the Structured Inheritance Networks (SI-Nets) paradigm. In other words, this means using eplstemological primitives such as Concepts, Roles and Structural Descriptions (Brachman, 1979), to represent these conceptual operations.","On the one hand, epistemological formalism, which is explicit and clear, can clarify the behaviour of conceptual operations of NL.","lSy the use of SI-Nets formalism as a means of description, a new perspective can be brought out, since this formalism makes it possible to represent objects as data types structured in a complex way instead of considering them as mezR atomic elements. This feature Is likely to change the nature of the operations to be carried out on objects thus leading us to deal with the complexity of many phenomena in a more adequate way.","On the other hand, this can lead to an investigation of the relationships between the conceptual aspects of NL and the epistemological primitives, in order to discover how the latter are used by the previously taentioned operations. In fact, we attempt to find out whether an isomorphism exists between objects and operations of NL and those used by epistemology.","According to Brachman (1979), five different approaches to the representational problem can be established: implementatlonal, logical, eplstemological, conceptual and linguistic. Each of them uses its own primitives so that the five levels can be interpreted as a hierarchy where each level involves different degrees of abstraction.","By virtue of this interpretation, we have tried to extend epistemology in a conceptual perspective. Our current approach considers epistemology as a starting point, thus looking at the conceptual level as one of the possible target points. This goal can be achieved by changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on SI-Nets. Consequently, operations on SI-Nets could assume a different aspect, that is to say they could be viewed not as merely isomorphic to single eplstemologieal objects but as a simulation of operations lylng on a different level, for instauce, that pertaining to the conceptual system of NL. This hypothesis can reduce SI-Nets to the level of an internal mechanism covering only abstract data representation, whose structure is not transparent to the user. In this case tile user interacts with the internal system by means of a separate external framework.","In order to achieve this goal we have designed and i~Iplemented a language, KL-Hagma which represents our epistemologlcal level. We are now designing and Implementing an experimental language, KL-Co nc, which should cover the conceptual level and ~lhlch uses KL-itaglaa as one of its internal co,mpo.ents.","The rest of the article will be devoted to a description of these two languages introducing considerations concerning their relevance to linguistic analysis and knowledge representation. We are confident that our approach can have interesting Ir,~plications for both these fields, 122 Since KL-Cone .functions can be used to describe linguistic entities in te~s of conceptual operations and may be viewed as a more natural way of interacting with SI-Nets. I I KL-MAGMA","KL-Magma is a version of KL-ONE implemented In MACt~-Lisp (Aslrelll et al. 1975).","It is a f~ language similar to the one described in Brach~nan (1979), Brac1~an et al. (1978), which also takes into account the versions given in Cappelll and Morettl (19S2) and Porta and Vlnchesl (1982). As in KL-One, ~[L-Hagma formal objects are Concepts, Roles and Structural Descriptions.","Concepts are descriptlonal structures providing an intenslonal representation of the domain, i. e. prototypes and individuals.","Roles are descriptional structures representing parts of Concepts, i. e. properties of prototypes and individuals.","Structural Descriptions are sets of relationships between Roles which give a whollstlc structure to Concepts.","Objects are connected with one another via Cables and Wires, thus resllzing Structured Inheritance.","In our current approach KL-Hsgma is mainly used as a declarative model of abstract data structures. It has no mechanism like the MSS Algorithm (Needs, 1981) or the KL-One Classifier (Sclmolze and Lipkis, 1983) which cover procedural aspects lying within epistemology, thus reaching valuable results in discovering new types of logic by deeply exploiting SI-Nets semantics. Instead, we have tried to discover types of procedurallty external to the eplstemological level and pertinent to the level we intend to represent. At any rate, we intend to govern epistemological processes by the external mechanism. In other words, this means assuming, for instance, the logic of subsumptlon , which is peculiar to epistemology, not as an autonomous deductive mechanism, but, instead, as a possible process controlled by the functions of the higher level language. III WIIAT TYPE OF CONCEPTUAL OPERATIONS ?","The conceptual operations of NL we intend to interpret are, for instance, Indlvldustions of objects, evaluations of objects, evaluations of properties of objects, evaluations of configurations of objects and so on.","Operations of this kind are trlggered by articles, adjectives, prepositional phrases, relative clauses and so on. These operations, already intuitively described in classical Linguistics, have been given more attention by investigations based on Logic. In the logic paradigm they can be viewed as classes, Sets, predicates etc..","In our opinion, the nature of these operations and, consequently, the description we intend to give of them, are not completely covered by logical analysis. Interesting results have been obtained by combining traditional logical systems with extensions of lambda calculi (~Jebber, 1978;1981). However, the types of complex procedurality peculiar to the operations have no~ yet been given a precise description; that is to say, procedurality has not been reduced to definite sets of restricted and clear procedures.","Let us now introduce an example. The Italian definite and indefinite articles (il, un) can be described as follows: a) indlvlduatlon of a specific object; b) indlviduation of any one object; c) reference to an abstract prototype.","In terms of logical description a) and b) may correspond to the iota operator and the existential quantifier of Logic; c) is similar to the universal quantifier even if the notion of a prototype is different, since it has an intenslonal nature.","However, we think that tlle three possible descriptions of Italian articles may include types of operations not covered by the use of the above mentioned logical operators. The article, like many other linguistic entities, integrates different kinds of operations which, at the same time, manipulate descriptions of prototypes and individuals, search into different kinds of memory, etc.","Let us introduce a new example. The adjective is one of the more conlplex phenomena of NL which cannot be reduced to the notion of predicate since it triggers a set of reasoning processes, that is to say, the manipulation of parts of knowledge. The following NP: I. un bambino rosso","may be interpreted as: a child has hair, hair has a color, the color can be red. This NP cannot be literally translated into English without adding more information; the appropriate translation is : a red-halted child.","In terms of SI-Nots this process can be represented as shown in figure I, assuming that 123 every lexlcal item of the NP has its own intensional representation. Figure I","However, the adjective does not specify all the steps of the reasoning process that it triggers, but only indicates, together with the name, the two extreme points of the chain leaving the intermediate undefined. The entire process, using generic knowledge as the reference point, is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2","It would be oversimplifyiug, as stated above, to use the notion of predicate to interpret this complex process as well as the other possible interpretation of the adjective: the one corresponding to tile notion of \"type of\" aQ in the NP \"a red color\" (see fl~ure 3). Figure 3","This type of phenomena can be investigated by deeply exploiting the structure and the semantics of SI-Nets. The structure of a role can be used as configuration of objects which are likely to be manipulated by complex processes not yet deeply investigated from any other viewpoint than the eplstemologlcal one. Once considered as a complex llnk, as it actually is, a role may be the locus where different processes can be triggered. It may be used simply to satisfy a structure of another role lying higher within the network or to trigger the complex processes we were talking about. The two behavlours mentioned exhibit different levels of abstraction; in the former case this means performing eplstemologlcal operations, while in the latter we simulate processes of a conceptual system used by NL. IV WHY A NEW LANGUAGE?","The question now arises whether it is possible to reduce these types of operations to a set of functions of a formal language each of which covers a well defined process which corresponds to a well defined set of operations on SI-Nets - to a set of KL-Magma functions.","The choice of a new language has many motivations: a) from the conceptual viewpoint, this means reducing operations to functions that are well defined from a semantic viet~polnt which lend clearness to tile process to be represented. a) from the epistemological viewpoint, it is reasonable to think that a language, such as KL-Magma, may be extended by another language thus achieving a higher degree of abstraction. c) a language is a uniform mechanism for the integration of interpreters of several symbolic processes. This integration is likely to bring out more clearly relevant phenomena of the process represented. V KL-CONC","On the basis of the linguistic assumptions previously outlincd and using KL-Hagma as a language which handles SI-Nets, we are now designing and implementing an experimental, language, KL-ConL, whose functions try to simulate the conceptual operations previously described. A. KL-Conc: Internal Organization","Before describing KL-Conc functions in detail, it is worth while discussing its internal organization. 124","In the framework of KL-oNE, a relevant distinction has been drawn between the Terminological Box (T-Box) and the Assertional Box (A-Box) (Brachman, 1981). The T-~ox maintains the detailed description of the objects while the A-Box contains the set of the assertions on the objects. The former corresponds to the ability of describing by the use of NPs, and the latter to that of constructing complex sentences.","A discussion has arisen whether it Is possible to handle the two boxes, which correspond to two different areas of memory, using the same language.","In KL-O~E, new functions have been added in order to glve it an assert~onal power (nexus, context) (Woods 1979).","A recent extellsion of KL-O~IE (Brachmsn et al., 1983) has adopted the solution of cresting two distinct languages: one for the T-Box and the other for the A-Box. The fon~er Is a sort of KL-ONE viewed in a functional way while the latter Is a language based on First Order Predicate Logic.","KL-~IACHA is only able to handle the T-Box and it has no assertional power. Instead, by KL-Cone we are trying to design a language which covers both terminological and assertional aspects, even if it is more biased towards assertlonallty. It is our intention to handle the T-Box mainly in an assertlonal way.","In order to achieve thls goal we have introduced the distinction between Long Term Hemory (L~I) and ~orklng |~emory (~,I) which in part covers the traditional one between T-Box and A-Box.","The LT~' is represented in EL-Magma data structures; this contains descriptional knowledge about generic and individual objects.","The W~! contains the history of the objects organized in a structured way. This is the central component of our current hypothesis. The |;H contains the traces of contextual relationships between objects, as well as operations triggered on and by objects; it can also contain other symbolic systems. The task of the ~JM is mainly to hold hypotheses to be mapped onto the LT~! which requires the cooperation of several interpreters.","The Introduction of a larger number of memory spaces increases the power of the language. For instance, a structured WU is likely to improve the number of s~nbolic systems interacting with one another. This makes It possible to insert into the language functions based on different processes. Taking for instance the history of the objects as a reference point, the objects themselves can be accessed according as they appear in the time flow. The function: <LAST arbitrary_name> returns the last object, created or manipulated, belonging to the class named by arbitrary n~ze. In other words, this allows the user to refer to objects using anaphorical references, that is to say using a s~nbolic system which is organized and represented in a different way from epistemology.","By the WM we are trying to create the basic mechanism to handle these types of processes. B. KL-Conc: External Organization","KL-Conc functions handle real world objects, so the user only needs to know a set of functions to be applied to objects. In this way, the structure of the Sl-?let which internally organizes the data, is hidden; the only t~ta which are transparent are objects, which may be individual or generic, together with syntactic rules for combining functions. These last are very flexible. Objects can be accessed using arbitrary names or by means of syntactic combinations which conceptually correspond to complex tests on the nature of objects, the configuration of objects etc.. Objects can be accessed according as they appear in the time flow.","The user can use the same name both for generic and individual objects. This is made possible by means of an internal generator of names which, starting from the name of a generic object, provides any individual of that class with a different name. This feature covers the part of the naming system of NL which uses the same name for individuals and prototypes. This does not cover the use of proper names which has been taken in JARGON (Woods, 1979) as the only means for naming individuals, thus oversimplifying the real system used by NL (Mark, 1981).","Objects can be accessed without the use of names, but by means of functions or combinations of functions in order to perfo~ complex tests on the nature of objects. This means referring to objects by testing properties or configurations. C. KL-Conc Functions KL-Conc has functions for creating, testing","and retrieving objects. This is the list of tile","functions so far designed: GEN NEUIND JUSTONE ANYO~:E SOME ALL LAST ADD PROPERTY ADD--CONFIGURATION OF PROPERTIES TEST PROPERTY TEST CONFICURATION OF PROPERTIES","The semantics of some KL-Cone functions may now be described in order to clarify how they 125 realize our linguistic assumptions. The semantics is given in terms of operations on SI-Nets.","As far as generic knowledge is concerned, the function: <GEL] arbltrary_na~;,e> returns the generic concept named by arbitraryname. If the concept does not exist in the LTM a new generic concept is created. The new concept is then returned. This function works both as a predicate and as a creating function. It is worth noticing that in KL-Hogma there are two distinct functions, one for the predicate (<Generic__Concept._P anything>), and the other for creating (<Create Concept name type of concept>). The function <PEWI~:D arbitrary_name> creates a new individual concept and establishes it as an individuator of the generic concept named by arbitrary name; if the generic concept does not exist in t~e LT~I it is created. An internal generator provides tile newly created individual concept wlth o nnme. This function corresponds to the follo~llng set of KL-[!agn.la functions: (Create_Concept X1Jndlvidual)","((Hot (Generlc_Concept_P X) (Create Concept X\" generic)) (Establish as Individuator X1 X)","This is one of the most \"declarative\" functions since it creates a new individual concept without searching in the LTN. In other words, tile user must be conscious that the new object is added to the L lqq and it is different from all the other objects. A more psychological oriented behavlour would require to test in advance the nature of the new object in order to decide whether the object is similar to or coincides with an individual object already inserted into tile LTH. The salute problem has been overcome in KRYPTO.~: by means of tile swltcb TELL/ASK (Brachman et al., 19P3). The function <JUSTOr!E arbitrary name> verifies whether there exists a unique individual either named by arbltrary, name or defined by tests or combinations of tests according to KL-Conc syntax. In other words, this means verifying if the object is unique as to its name, or as to one of its properties etc. The KL-Conc expressions for the two meanings are, respectively: (JUSTO~E table) (JUSTONE (TESI~PROPERTY table red))","This function has a complex behavlour, since, intuitively, it must verify the unlqueness of an object and must return: i) the individual if unique; ll) the llst of individuals if more than one satisfies the conditions .given by assertions; Ill) NIL if no invlvldual exists satisfying the conditions (Carnap, 1947). The three answers have different meanln~s, since they imply different operations to be triggered on the memory spaces or, at any rate, they have different effects on the behavlour of functions where JUSTONE can be nested. The function:","<TEST CONFIGURATION OF PROPERTIES ~rbltrary_namel arbltrary_name2> verifies whether arbitrary name2 exists in the horizontal chain . of r~les starting from arbitrary_namel (see Figure 4)","1 • • L°QO","* Figure 4 BY the function: <ADD_PROPERTY arbltrary__namel arbltrary_name2) we intend to add roles to concepts so that the user needs not have any specific kno~Jledge about the distinction between generic and instance roles or, seen from a different viewpoint, between properties of prototypes and properties of individuals. Taking NL as the reference point, we think that the above mentioned distinction is peculiar only to certain linguistic elements; in the case of operations on propertles, no distinction is made; it is the conceptual operations governing the operations on properties that control the correct application of the adding or testing properties. Consequently, the function ADD PROPERTY must be designed In order to make it pos~Ible to trigger the correct procedures depending on the type of objects which it is applied to. For this purpose, we intend to use a metarepresentation of KL-Hagma (Cappelli et al., 1983) which, on detecting tile type of object, automatically apply the appropriate procedures. This implies a system which creates or tests knowledge structures interpreting its own syntax.","Let's now briefly describe two possible behavlours of this function.","Wtlen applied to individual concepts, thls creates a new instance role establishing it as a 126 satisfler of a higher generic role of the generic concept ancestor of the individual concept. If a possible generic role does not exist it is created without inserting any V/R in the generic role, since it could be a more general concept than the generic concept ancestor of the value of the newly created instance role. The structures created by this function are shown in figure 5 by dotted lines. \"~0// I","The functions described in this article represent only a subset of the operations which can be embodied in tile language. In this sense, the number of KL-Conc functions is likely to be increased in order to cover new processes.","So far, we have designed the functions for those operations which exhibit the same behaviour whatever domain they are applied to, since they represent the \"deep\" behavlour of syntactic elements. It is to be emphasized that we have tried to reduce to the fomn of functions of a language, all the operations of NL which are domaln-lndependent and which represent aspects of the abstract syntactic ability of structuring knowledge facts (Cappelll etal., 1983; Cappelll and Moretti, 1983)","Using KL-Conc it is possible to investigate how linguistic elements can be described in temns of conceptual operations. This is a further step towards the linguistic level. On reaching this level, the task will be to discover how the conceptual operations are embodied in linguistic forms.","The previously mentioned Italian articles may be described as follows: Figure 5","~en applied to generlc concepts, the function adds a new generic role, trying to link it with a higher generic role. If no generic role is found, a higher generic role is created without providing it with any information other than the one inferred from the structure of the newly created subrole. VI CONCLUSIOtIS","Some conclusions may now be drawn both from a linguistic sad a knowledge representation viewpoint.","From a linguistic viewpoint some relevant facts must be pointed out.","First of all, the level of integration reached by the construction of a uniform language, can bring out more clearly the nature of many phenomena of [;L, since it is possible to put together many processes which cooperatively contribute to the realization of a single phenomenon. This means looking at the complexity of HL with the aid of a powerful symbolic Instr~nent, capable of handling contemporaneously several aspects of that complexity, thus reaching a higher degree of adequacy. In designing KL-Conc, we aim to create a framework which can extend the possibility of investigating and representing these phenomena.

The user is not required to have a specific knowledge of Sl-Nets fo~iallsm; he only needs to know a set of functions to be applied to objects.","In this sense KL-Conc assumes a more natural aspect, thus overcoming the constraint of a structure-orlented language such as KL-Ha~zLa. This feature has been obtained by handling Sl-~ets in a more compact way. KL-Conc provides the user with a set of functions which are not isomorphic to single eplstemologlcal objects but which handle pieces of network starting from discontinuous information.","This weakness, peculiar to NL, is made possible in KL-Conc by assuming the epistemologlcal level as a reference schema, instead of a reductlonlst for,uallsm. This means introducing mechanisms for relaxing the rules"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["KL-Ha~sa.
