They offer certain difficulties which seem to suggest a substantial revision of the ATN formalism. The theoretical assumptions and an experimental implementation of such a revision are presented, together with examples. }:any related theoretical points such as some psyeholinguistic implications and the relationship between deterministic and non-deterministlc hypothesis are also briefly discussed. I. INTRODUCTION","Certain types of sentences seem to defy the abilities of several parsers, and some of them are being now discussed by many computational linguists, mostly within the deterministic hypothesis.","An exmaination of their treatment within the traditional AT[: paradigm seems to suggest that the real discussion is about how to acces the left context and what its form should be. II. ACCESS TO T}]E LEFT COfJTEXT occurs, the parsing algorith~ suspends the current computation and starts a new level of computation. Usually, each network recognizes some linguistic unit such as Noun Phrase (NP), Prepositional Phrase (PP), and Sentence (S) and any recursively embedded call to one of them corresponds to a level of computation.","The parsed parts of the input string are stored (SETRed) into registers as they are recognized. At the end of the network these registers are combined (BUILDQed) into a parse node and returned (POPed) to the calling net. Appropriate functions can return the content of a register (GETR) or transfer it to another register (combination of SETR with a GETR). This last operation is equivalent to i) the renaming of a register, if the source register is successively set to a different value, ii) the initialization of a register at a lower or higher level, if SENDR or LIFTR are used.","Initialization is co~aonly used to i) raise lexical features to a higher level where they are used for tests (ex.: subject-verb agreement), ii) pass possible antecedents to lower levels where a gap may be detected in an embedded clause. B. Difficult access to registers i.

As no subject NP is met after labelled states and directed arcs connecting them. \"che', an interpretation is yielded with The arcs can rlco~nize terminal (words) and \"Giovanni\" in subject position. The second non-temnlnal (lexical cateF, ories) s~anbols or interpretation is produced si,,ply by successively reeursively call for a network identified by the setting the SULqJ register to a d~;~my node, which label of an initial state. When such a call (i) The ambiguity of this sentence is the sa1:~e as its English translation where \"he\" can be bouud either to \"John\" or to soueone else ,~eutioned in a previous sentence. Italian has a gap instead of a pronoun. 58 remains unfilled. The same treatment is recursively applied to sentences llke","(2) Giovanni pensava che avrebbe raccontato John thought that (he) would have told a tutti che aveva fatto una to everybody that (he) had done a scoperta discovery where \"Giovanni\" must serve as subject of both the first and the second (linearly) complement. Instead, in the sentence","(3) Giovanni dlsse che i suol colleghl avevano John said that his colleagues had mentito lied 2. Lexieal features raising","A storage overload may also be caused by the need for raising lexieal features. ~orphological features are necessary at the least in the test of subject-verb agreement. This is done by LIFTRIng in ad hoe registers gender and number from the NP level to the S level. If the :;P is popped in a possible subject position the test for agreement may take place by comparing the content of those registers with the corresponding features of the verb. However, there are cases such as ex.(1) in which such information must be used again in the course of the analysis for another (agreement) test. Those features must be~ therefore, copied in appropriately labelled registers in order to i) flag their relation to the subject and ii) prevent theln from being erased when the s~ne features are LIFTRed from the following NP. as the ~:P \"i suoi colle~;hi\" is analysed, it replaces the SENDRed \"Giovanni\" in the SUBJ register and the correct interpretation is popped.","The same need for ad boc storing may be shown for the object and few PP complements. For example, in the sentence","A more complex treatuent is required for the sentence","(4) Giovanni pensava che i suoi colleghi avrebbero John thought that his colleagues would raccontato a tutti che aveva fatto have told to everybody that (|.e) had done una scoper ta a discovery where \"Giovanni\" must get through the first complement and reappear in the second (embedded) one. If SENDR is used, a transit re~ister RI with the same content as the initialized SUBJ register is to be passed down together with it. When the subject of the first complement ('i suoi colleghi') is found, it replaces \"Giovanni\" in SUEJ but not in RI. The new SUBJ \"i suoi colleghi\" and RI \"Giovanni\" are again SENDRed to the embedded complement where the agreement with the verb correctly selects, as subject, the content of RI. l~ow, as the number of levels which to \"jump over\" is in principle illlmited and each one uay have its own subject to be SENDRed, a tra~Isit register for each new subject is needed. Thus, for the sentence (5) Giovanni era sicuro che i suoi ner,lci avrebbero rivelato alla stamps che sua moglie avers detto un ;~iorno che l'aveva picchiata(2)","(6) Ii capitano disse ai soldati che The captain said to the soldiers that","marciavano pietosamente"]},{"title":"(they)","paragraphs":["were marching peatifully as the t!P \"i soldati\" embedded in the \"a-PP\" is the subject of the complement, its gender and nu~iber must travel up through PP and S and down to the complement, in order the subject-verb agreement to be satisfied. This implies that at a given moment other registers containing morphological features coexist at the S level with those of the subject.","An obvious remedy to this proliferation of registers consists in adding these features to tile tiP or PP structure, POPing them, and extracting them from those structures when needed. But classical ATN does not provide a suitable function, a form that should return only a part of a stored tree after having searched through it. Now, although such functions are not particularly complex to design [5, 7], they are not perfectly consistent with the ATe( general formalism which does not take into consideration the extraction of pieces of already processed information from the structure they have Deen inserted in.

(3) A possible alternative, equally trlcky,is the use of the HOLD-VIRT couple."]},{"title":"59","paragraphs":["information somewhere back in the already built structures; the tricky solutions presented above are, in fact, a way of accessing parts of the left context. These sometimes correspond to the entire content of a register and sometimes to a fragment of it.","We will assume, then, that the left context is stored in a space of memory, equally accessible from any level and that retrieving always concerns fragments of it. At any point of the process this structure contains the current hypothesis about the analysis of the parsed segment of the input from the beginning; hence we will refer to it as Current Global Hypothesis (CGH). The retrieving action will have two participants, a symbol that triggers the action (trig£er) and the infomnation to be retrieved (the target of the action). In this frame all the different procedures discussed above may be reduced to a single general algorithm of three steps, i) identification of a trl~er (a gap to be filled, a verb uhich demands for the subject-verb agreement test) ii) extraction of constraints which ::~ust guide the search for the target, and iii) retrieving of the required inforuation.","On this functional ground, the same description fits to the binding of an anaphoric pronoun to its antecedent [7] as in","(7) a) Giovanni disse a harla che voleva John said to .~ary that (he) wanted sposarl-la marry her","as opposed to","b) Giovanni dlsse a llaria che voleva John said to ~!ary that (he) ~lanted sposarsi to marry The function that searches back may be constrsined by several types of restrlctlons, includin~ i) morphological features, i.e. the gender and number of the pronoun or those required for agreement by the syntactic environment (e.g. the verb), ll) syntactic idiosyncrasies of soue lexical Ite~:~ such as the STRA~S verbs that determine which of their arguments is to be the subject of the couplement, ill) seLlautic features that may be introduced in the process, and iv) syntactic deter,-.inat ion of the scope of the search. 2. .!anipulations of the left context","I[et rieving of the antecedent nay actually correspond to two different operations depending upon ~hether the antecedent to be bound li~Learly preceeds or follows the syubol it is to be bound to.","In the cases discussed abovu the gap or the pronoun always follow there antecedent and it is therefore possible to i~ ,:~edia tel y insert the binding pointer.

Notice that this class of sentences entirely lies beyond the abilities of the classical ATi~ framework.","Relative pronouns also need to be bound to an antecedent and, besides, are the surface signal of an embedding. ~:o special processing difficulty is proposed by sentences like","(i0) Ii ra~azzo ehe corre The boy who runs where the relative pronoun occurs exactly ~here the embedding begins.

III. EXPF.~ I~IE,~TAL I~d'LEF,'ENTATIO;I A. General assumptions","[~ost of the above discussion is based on our own experience with an ATN parser, although valid also for other parsers. Some of the linguistic phenomena we are trying to functionally classify have been recently discussed in the frame of the detenainistic parsing and sou, e progress in the treatment of those sentences has been done. However ~Je prefer to stick to the non-deten:~inistic hypothesis, because no valuable ar~;ument seems to stand against ti~e idea of AT~ as a collection of alternative heuristic strateEies representing those used in the human sentence processing. On the contrary it is possible to introduce in an ATN parser some mechanism for selecting strategies in function of a text or a sublangua;~e [Ii].","Our assumption is, then, that the possibility of backtracking must be kept, but restricted by i. introducing linsuistic coDstraints to guide the choice of alternatives; ii. manipulating the left context in some cases in which backtracking can be intuitively charged on inadequacies of the parser rather than on points of real linguistic ambiguity.","A second assumption more related to the current implementation of the system refers to the grammatical fomnalisn. A functional representation a la ['..Kay [i~] is used. A detailed explanation of this fonaalis:~ is not necessary to the understanding of this paper. It is enough to know that its ];asic unit is the attribute-value pair, wk,ere an attribute is a symbol (label) and a value is a symbol or another functional description. In the sentence (15) lle killed her a possible pair is SUEJ=he, or SUBJ=HEAD=he together with SUBJ=CAT=PRON etc. Any sequence of sy~nbols is a path leading to a value; thus the value of SUI;J=:IEAD is \"he'.","The functions that access the data structure are specifically desi.~;ned to treat this type of representation but ~.,e think that they could be easily Feneralizcd. The ter-n \"component\" will be used to identify the get of paths startin;; fro,~ the sa:ae lal;el (radix).","The reasons of this choice are as follows: i. addressim: frabments of information is more easily done by follo~,In~: a path of labels than by visiting; a unlabellcd tree; ii. functional grammar allows any depth of linguistic representatiou through the left adjunction of labels; iii. functional syntactic repeseutation and lexical features (also expressed in tenas of attribute- value pairs) ;~ay be treated in a uniform way. B. The parser","The basic features of the ATN :~,arser used in our previous experi~aents [19], i.e. the network formalism and the parsing algoritl~a, are kept, while the data structure and the whole set of actions and forms have been modified. Also the use of the push-down mechanisn~ has been ,modified to some extent. The data structure is a list which is mainly accessed wittl a typical LIFO stack policy. It represents a unique memory space non splitted into registers. The state saving mechanism necessary for the treatraent of non-detenainism is provided by XD-LISP [2,17], the dialect of LISP in which the system is written. At any point in which non-determinism is called, the previous context, in particular the data, is saved and only the new values are set in the current context. Therefore, there is no difference between the use of the traditional register table and this special list since both of them are handled in the same way. This (LIFO) list contains at any point of the process the CGI', i.e. the entire left context literally represented in ten,~s of attribute-value pairs. We give hereafter a llst in Backus notation of the functions which access the CCH.","I .Actions","a. <storing actions>::= ADD pair location ] ASSIGN label path <location>::= NIL ] <farad> <label>::= any label <pair>::= label value <value>::= * [ <fen|>","b. <list manipulation>::= PUSU I"]},{"title":"PoP l","paragraphs":["INSERT data item <data>::= any data <item>::= <fon~>","2.

Generalization and modularity","The set of actions and forr~s presented seem to provide a functional descril;tion of many linguistic pheno~nena. They can be regarded as linguistic (procedural) generalizations, at least on the functional y~round. This supports our claim that linguistic pheno~:~ena can be described, in~lepen~ently fro~ tbc fon;~alisu that expresses them ( the grammar), in ter~.is of general operations. This set of operations is open- ended and can, therefore, be increased with functions designed for the treatment of new phenomena, as they are discussed and described. Furthermore, those actions can be taken to represent nlental operations of the language user, thus providing a valuable frame for psycLolinguistic experiments. IV. ADVA~:TAGES A. Efficiency","The parser we have been presenting is based on the core algorithm of the AT~J. Our modifications affect the set of for, us and actions and the data structure. The parsin~ algorithu~, therefore, keeps the efficiency of traditional ATE. We have already shown that the storing of the data structure does not present any special difference from the traditional re:~isters syste~, even in relation to the treatL~ent of non-determini~l. The r,:emory load is. therefore, strictly a function of tile length of the parsed se:_,L::ent of the input an(] no overhead determined by t~anipulations of structures is added as in the case of transit registers.","The actiol~s an,! fom~s are equivalent to the tra~?itional ones, but for the fact that [~ost of tile.., :Lust visit the t~holc left context for every access. ~.~y:;ay this effec~ hardly l,alances the s~tting of transit re~,+isters. In fact, it is ~;or th noting: that in the ~lajority of comrlon sentences such accesses are very reduced, go that","It is obvious that this view strongly inclines towards the idea of parser as a collection of heuristic strategies and processes and also offers a aye,|metric alternative to the HOLD hypothesis. According to thls hypothesis there are points in a sentence in which comprehension needs a heavier memory load; instead in our view an overhead of operations is suggested. Anyway the distinguished phenomena coincide, thus keeping the inte~rity of the experimental data(6). C. Naturallty","Our hypothesis seems more natural in t~.,o ~Jays. It embeds into a non-detemninistic frame so~+e operations very similar to some of those designed and discussed in the deterlnini.'~tlc hypotilesis [3, 4, 15, 16, 19]. The result is a strong limitation of the effects of non-determinism, at least for those cases they are desigue~t to treat. It is interesting that starting from two opposed viewpoints co~aparable resul t'~ are obtaine~t. i~evertheless, as stated above, we tt~ink that imposing constraints to a non-deterministic :,:odel is ::io re natural than being: imposed ~ lobal constraints by the assu~q)tiou of ti~termiuism.

Then, a model such as the non-detem~inistic one, in which there is place for the study of human heuristic constraints, seems more attractive and natural.","Our hypothesis seems intuitively natural also in so much as it tries to propose a \"theory of guess ~. During the comprehension of a sentence guesses (CGII's) are progressively enriched and stored in a space of memory. During this process errors may he done. For some of them it is enough to ,aodify the previous guess while for others a real backtracking and reanalysis is necessary. Although the distinction between the two types of errors is unclear, it provides a valuable frame for further research in the domain of computational linguistics as well as psycholinguisties. In [>articular it seems to distim3uish in the activity of sentence comprehension a phase of structuring from a phase of perception. Errors occurring in t~,e former are remedied by ~nodifyin~ a guess, while those occurring in the latter need baektrackin~ and the choice of another strategy. V • PERSPECTIVES","A more serious systematization of the proposed functions, as well as the extension of the model to ~ore and more llnguistic phenomena are obvious extensions of the present project.","Another direction where investigation seems to be particularly fruitfull is the relation between syntax and ser.:antics. On one hand, the fact that the result of the analysis is progressively stored in a unique space of uemory :lo not it:pose special constraints on the structure of the analyzed strin~. On the other hand, many of the presented functions include parameter slots for conditions which may be filled with any kind of test.

The stored structure can be a semantic one and the tests can also incorporate se~;.antic descriptions. This seems to eventually lead to an easier integration of the two levels, h~e will present shortly [i0] a first approxi~.ation to a frame into which such in inte~ration can be realized.
