From the viewpoint of the translation of CA expressions (and also of the multiple occurrence thereof inside a sentence) into a calculus of intensional logic, it should be noted that the TFA properties of CA expressions are directly correlated to the scope properties thereof. Our approach, which is stated in terms of a lir~istic theory, serves as a basis for an algorithm of analysis of CA for purposes of a system of man-machine communication without a pro-arranged data base. positions of the occurrence of negation. As negation only slightly differs in its distribution on the surface, there is raised a proposal according to which negation (and other minority group adverbs with similar properties) should be generated as a case of CA.","CA (including negation and other minority group adverbs) is defined in FCD by its position in the underlying basic ordering of complementations; presumably, it occupies the leftmost, i.e. the communicatively least dynamic position.","The TFA properties of CA (also on its multiple occurrence inside a sentence) should be taken into account also in the translation of CA expressions into a calculus of intensional logic because they are directly correlated to the scope properties thereof.","The TFA distinctions which are reflected on the surface serve es clues for an algorithm of analysis of CA expressions in written technical texts for purposes of a question answering system without a pre-arranged data base. I INTRODUCTION","In the present paper we argue that the so-called sentence adverbials (typically, adverbs like probabl~, admittedl2,... ) as well as certain minority group adverbs (such as especially, also, not, even,...) should be generated-~-in-~ framework of Functional Generative Description (henceforth, FGD), by means of a new complementation (functor, deep case), namely Complementation of Attitude (henceforth, CA).","We argue that in the underlying structure of a sentence, CA can occupy several positions in the topic-focus articulation (henceforth, TFA) of a sentence, which coincide with the II THEORETICAL BACKGROUND A. General Issues","FCD is a multilevel system; it consists of a sequence of five levels which are connected by the asymmetrical relation of form and function, which accomts for the phencmen~ of homonymy and synonymy in natural language. The description of a sentence is equivalent to a sequence of its representations on all levels. The difference between the level of (strict, literal, linguistic) meaning (i.e. the underlying, 74 or tectogr~mmatical level - a level of disambiguated linguistic expressions) and the level of surface syntax, being parallel to the difference which is made in transformational grammar between the levels of deep and surface structure, constitutes the strong"]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["enerative power of the FGD system; see Sgall et al., 1969), (Haji~ovA and Sgall, 1980), and (Sgall et al., forthcoming).","The grammar of FGD consists of the generative component in the form of a dependency grammar, which generates underlying (tectogrammatical) representations (henceforth, TRs) of sentences in the form of linear formulas (which can be rendered also in the shane of rooted and projective dependency trees), and of the transductive component, by means of which TRs are translated, step by step, onto the lower levels of FGD.","~ost important for the considerations in linguistic theory is the level of meaning - a link between the lower levels of the linguistic system and the (extralinguistic) domain of cognitive (ontological) content. It should be emphasized in this place that the distinctions of the level of meaning are correlated to those of the domain of cognitive content only in the translation of (disambiguated, meaningful) linguistic expressions into a calculus of intensional logic, see ([,~aterna and Sgall, 1980), (Kosfk and Sgall, 1981) and (~aterna and Sgall, 1983). Thus, there should be distinguished, on the one hand, the linguistic semantics, which deals only with the distinctions which are structured by the linguistic form, see (Sgall et al., 1977) and also de Saussure's and Hjelmslev's conception of meaning as \"form of content\", and on the other hand, the logical (cognitive) semantics, which is committed to (conceptions of) the ontological structure of reality and which is used in the interpretation of linguistic expressions with respect to the extralinguistic content in their translation into a logical calculus, e.g. for purposes of natural language understanding.","There are two relations defined on the dependency tree of the TR of a sentence: the relation of dependency and the relation of the deep word-order, which means that a TR captures the twofold structuring of (the meaning of) a sentence: its (syntactically based) dependency ~tructure and its (semantico- -pragmatically based) communicative structure, i.e. its TFA.","In the dependency structure of a sentence the root of the tree reoresents the main verb, and the nodes of the main subtree represent its obligatory, optional and free complementations. The dependency principle is recursive. Each node has labels of three types: lexemic, morphological (such as -plural, -future,...) and syntactic (such as Actor, Locative,...); the syntactic labels may be alternatively viewed as labels on the edges of the tree. Every verb, noun, adjective and adverb has its case frame, i.e. a specificstion of its obligatory and ootional complementstions, see (Panevov~, 1977). B. Tooic-Focus Articulation Background","In the communicative structure of a sentence there is captured the deep word-order of the (occurrences of) complementations, corresponding to a hierarchy of degrees of communicative dynamism thereof, as well as the boundary (boundness juncture) between the topic and the focus of a sentence, i.e. between the contextually bound and non-bound elements of the main subtree of a sentence. In fact, the above mentioned communicative distinctions cut across the dependency structure of a sentence; thus, every embedded clause as well as every (complex) phrase has its secondsry TFA, including a secondary boundness juncture. The notion of contextual boundness is broadly conceived: not only a previous mentioning in a text but also a situational activation may cause ~he contextual boundness of an element. ~","The degrees of communicative dynamism of the complementations","On the surface we observe different means of how the TFA of a sentence is expressed: cf. the free surface word- -order in inflectional languages vs. the various syntactic means in languages with a fixed (grammatical) surface word- -order (such as cleft sentences or the existential construction there is in English), or the particles ga-a-~ wa in Japanese. A surface representation~f a sentence is often ambiguous between several possible underlying sources concerning the different placings of the boundness juncture; these possibilities may be disclosed by means of the negation test or the question test, see (Sgsll and Haji~ov~, 1977-78). 75 occurring in the focus of a sentence (i.e. also in a topicless sentence) obey the scale of the underlying basic ordering of complementations, or systemic ordering (i.e. ordering of all types of complementations on their occurrence in a topicless sentence).","In FGD, universe of discourse is conceived as the activated part of the stock of knowledge shared by the speaker and the hearer during the discourse. The stock of shared knowledge is supposed to be dynamic, i.e. changing (being modified) in time during a discourse. The most activated elements of the stock of shared knowledge appear as the communicatively least dynamic occurrences of complementations inside a sentence. The speaker, essentially, is free in the choice of the topics of sentences. C. Exemplification","By way of illustration of TRs of sentences in FGD, let us observe the surface sentence 1 and one of its TRs (namely the one where the Actor is contextually bound) captured by a (simplified) linear notation and indicated as TR l, where act stands for Actor, art for Attitude, loc for Location, b is a superscript indicating contextual boundness, the slash denotes the boundness juncture of a sentence, and the brackets correspond in a certain way to the edges of the dependency tree. 1 Terry will probably run to Brooklyn. TR i ((Terryb)ac t / (probablY)att run-fut (Brooklyn)loc)","III CO~.IPLEi~ENTATION OF ATTITUDE IN THE TOPIC-FOCUS ARTICULATION OF A SENTENCE","A. Complementation of Attitude an__~d Ne~ati6n","The starting point of our argument is the claim that CA obeys essentially the same pattern of occurrence in the underlying TFA structure of a sentence as the one which was proposed by (Haji~ov~, 1973) for negation.","In her conception, negation is an abstract, operator-like functor of FOr without a label on its edge and without pertinence to the TFA of a sentence; the symbol NEG, generated as a label on the node of the functor of negation, must be changed by surface rules into such forms as not, do not, etc.","In spite of the alleged non-pertinence of negation to the TFA of a sentence, there are delineated by Haji~ovA exactly three TFA positions (with respect to the position of the verb) in which negation can be generated; out of them, two belong to the primary case (negation occurring in the focus of a sentence) and one belongs to the secondary case (negation occurring in the topic of a sentence).","In the scheme which follows we shall see that these three underlying positions are a perfect match to the possibilities of occurrence, in the TFA of a sentence, of CA. ~ In the examples, the scopes of the expressions in question are indicated by arrows. It should be noted that in the primary case (i.e. in (i) and (ii)), the scopes of the expressions in question extend over the focus of a sentence.","(i) The verb of a sentence is non-bound (i.e. it occurs in the focus of a sentence). There is negated (\"attituded\") the relation between the topic and the focus of a sentence.","In fact, there is even a fourth possible position of negation and CA in the TFA of a sentence, which can be subcategorized as a subcase of (i): namely, a position where negation and CA are not only less communicatively dynamic than the (non-bound) verb, but where they play the role of the least communicatively dynamic element of a sentence (cf. TRs 2\" and 3\", also underlying the ambiguous 2 and 3, respectively), this leftmost position coinciding with the position of negation and CA in the underlying basic ordering of complementations.

There is negated (\"attituded\") the relation between the topic and the (nonverbal) focus of a sentence. In this case, negation (or the CA expression) can stand, on the surface, either in the preverbal ,osition, which gives rise to ambiguity with case (i) above (cf. the ambiguous ~urface sentences 2 and 3), or in the ~ostverbal position, which is unambiguou:J (cf. the surface sentences 4"]},{"title":"and 5).","paragraphs":["4 Terry will run not to Brqokl,yn.

On this prooosal, there would be removed from FGD the only abstract label (NEG) and substituted by the adverb not, which should be viewed as a regular tectogrsmmatical lexical unit occurring in TRs of sentences.

In fact, every adverbial expression which obeys the paradigm of occurrence in the TFA of a sentence as specified in IIIA.

The adverbial expressions belonging","IV ~LTIPLE OCCURRENCE OF CO~PLE?~NTATION OF ATTITUDF INSID~ A SENTENCE","In the underlying representations of sentences in FGD, CA can be generated essentially on two principles of multiple occurrence of a com~lementation inside a sentence.","(i) Firstly, there can be generated in the focus (and in the secondary case, also in the topic) of a sentence clusters of two or more occurrences of CA, which differ in the degrees of their con~unicative dynamism; there hold specific scope relations between them; the CA expression with the highest degree of communicative dynsmism in the cluster has in its scooe the rest of the focus of a sentence (in the ~rimary case), or the rest of the topic (in the secondary case); the other CA expressions in the cluster have in their scopes the rest of the cluster. 78","If the adverbial expressions inside the cluster belong to different groups of CA, they obey a certain kind of ordering (as suggested by the listing in III D.), whose violatio~ yields ungrammaticality (cf. 8 vs. 9).

In TRs of sentences in FGD, coordination and apposition are not represented by means of the dependency tree, but require a special device. Thus, coordinative and appositive occurrences of CA have identical scopes: in ll, probably and certainly have in their scopes Terry will run to Brooklyn, 3 On the multiple occurrence of CA within the loose occurrence thereof or within the coordinative-appositive multiple occurrence thereof, CA expressions do not obey the ordering suggested in III D; cf. a. a.

ANALYSIS OF CO~LEMENTATION OF ATTITUDE","In the analysis of simple CA occurrences in sentences in written technical texts within the framework of the question answering system TIBAO (cf. (~gall, 1983)), cases to be resolved by an algorithm concern, in fact, only those adverbs which may function both as CA and as Complementation of ~nner (such as amusingly, curiously, delightfully, foolishly, naturally, really, reasonably, S~rangely, surprisingly, unexpectedly, ~,... of group (iii), or honestly,~, ~,... of group (i)). The adverbs w-h-~can function only as CA (such as probably, admittedly, unfortunately,... - there are at least one hundred of them) should be listed in the lexicon.","Presumably, there occurs only one kind of genuine ambiguity with the adverbs which may function in the mentioned two ways (cf. line 8 of the algorithm below); 4 other cases of surface ambiguity can be resolved by an algorithm, due to the underlying TFA distinctions which are reflected on the surface (cf. line 9 of the algorithm below) as well as due to some 4 In cases of genuine ambiguity (such as the one in 8 of the algorithm), the adverbial expression in question (naturally) cannot be resolved automatically because of the lack of surface clues for the disambiguation of the boundness juncture of the sentence: in this case, the adverbial expression in question functions as C~ if it is located in the focus of a sentence, and ~ as non-CA if it is located in the topic of a sentence. 79 idiosyncratic surface clues with the loose occurrence of CA in the sentence- -final position (cf. line 6 of the algorithm below).
