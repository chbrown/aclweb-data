The main fea ture of the approach on which the parser is based consists in a two-level representation of the sy_n tactic knowledge: a first set of rules emits h~ potheses about the constituents of the sentence and their functional role and another set of rules verifies whether a hypothesis satisfies the con straints about the well-formedness of sentences. However, the application of the second set of rules is delayed until the semantic knowledge con firms the acceptability of the hypothesis. If the semantics reject it, a new hypothesis is obtained by applying a simple and relatively unexpensive \"natural\" modification; a set of these modifica tions is predefined and only when none of them is applicable a real backup is performed: in most cases this situation corresponds to a case where people would normally garden path. INTRODUCTION","The problem of performing an accurate synta~","tic analysis of Natural Language sentences is","still challenging for A.I. people working in the","field of N.L. interpretation (Charniak 81, Kaplan","82). The most relevant points which attracted at","tention recently are: the need of a strong connection between synta~ tic processing and semantic interpretation in order to reduce the space of the alternative sy~ tactic analyses (Konolige 80, Sidner et al. 81, Milne 82)","- the convenience of a quasi-deterministic synta~ tic analysis, in order to reduce the computation al overhead associated with a heavy use of back up (Marcus 80)","- the convenience of an approach which tolerates also (partially) incorrect sentences, at least when it is possible to obtain a meaningful inter","pretation (Weischedel & Black 80, Kwasny & Sond","heimer 81, Hayes 81). The first two of these remarks guided the design and the implementation of a system devoted to the interpretation of N.L. (Italian) commands (Lesmo, Magnani & Torasso 81a and 81b). In that system, however, as in most N.L. interpreters, the anal~ sis of the input sentence is mainly syntax-driven; for this reason, justin case the input sentence respects the constraints imposed by the syntactic knowledge it can be interpreted.","The problem of analyzing ill-formed sentences has received a great deal of attention recently. However, most studies (Weischedel & Black 80, Kwasny & Sondheimer 81) are based on standard syn_ tactic analyzers (A.T.N.) which have been further ly augmented in order to take into account sen fences lacking some required constituents (elli~ sis) or where some syntactic constraints are not respected (e.g. agreement in number between the subject and the verb).","There are two problems with this approach; both of them depend on the choice of having a sy~ tax based analysis. The first problem is the ne cessity of extending the grammar; of course, it is necessary, in general, to specify what is grarmuat~ cal'and what is not, but it would be useful that this specification does not interfere too heavily in the interpretation of the sentence. In fact, if all deviations would have to be accounted for in the grammar, an unforeseen structure would block the analysis, even if the sentence can be consider ed as understandable. Consider, for instance, the following sentence: Mary drove the car and John the truck (SI) The absence of the verb in the second clause can be considered an acceptable form of ellipsis and, consequently, the sentence can be interpreted cor rectly. On the othe: hand, it is very unlikely that an extension of the grammar would cover the following ungrammatical (see Winograd 83, pag.480) sentence: • The book that for John to read would be difficult is beautiful ($2) 114 However, even if some efforts are required, this sentence can be considered as understandable. As stated above, a comprehensive system must be able to detect the ungrammaticality of $2, but this de tection should not prevent the construction of a structure to pass to the semantic analyzer. More over, it seems that a subtle grammaticality test of this kind is easier to make (and to express) on a structured representation of the sentence (e.g. a tree) than on the input sentence as such.","The second problem which must be faced when an ATN . ~s extended to handle ill-formed sen tences is the one of word ordering. ATNs are po E erful formal tools able to analyze type-O lan guages; in the theory of formal languages alan guage is defined as a set of strings; for this reason ATNs must recognize Uordered sequences\" of symbols (or words). Of course also the natural lan guages have fixed rules which define the admissi ble orderings of words and constituents, but, if those constraints have to be relaxed to accept ill-formed inputs, some extension%which are less straightforward than the ones used for handling the absence of a constituent are needed. For exam pie, the sentence Ate the apple John ($3) is ungrammatical, easily understandable, but seems to require in an ATN the extension of the S net~to allow to traverse the constituents in a different (even if syntactically wrong) order. Also in this case it seems that the construction of a struetur ed representation of the sentence could be the first step of the analysis; when it is done, the ordering constraints can easily be verified and, in case they are not respected either an alterna rive analysis is tried•or, as in the case of $3~ the sentence is passed to the Semantic analyzer and, possibly, the parser signals the presence of a syntactic error.","In this paper we present a parser which al lows to make axplicit the interconnections between syntax and semantics , to analyze the sentences in a quasi-deterministic fashion and, in many cases, to identify the roles of the various constituents even if the sentence is ill-formed.","The main feature of the approach on which the parser is based consists in the two-level represe~ tation of the syntactic knowledge: a first set of rules emits hypotheses about the constituents of the sentences and their functional role and an","m other set of rules verifies whether a hypothesis satisfies the constraints about the well-formed hess of sentences. However, the application of the second set of rules is delayed until the semantic knowledge confirms the acceptability of the hyp~ thesis. If the semantics reject the current hyp~ thesis, an alternative one is tested: this control structure guarantees that all hypotheses which sa tisfy the weak syntactic constraints (which govern the emission of hypotheses) and the semantic con straints are tried before considering the input sentence as uninterpretable.","The claim that the parser operates in a quasi-deterministic fashion is justified by the kind of processing that the system performs when a hyp~ thesis is rejected: in most cases a new hypothesis is obtained by applying a simple and relatively un expensive \"natural\" modification; a set of these modifications is predefined and only when none of them is applicable a real backup is performed: in most cases this situation corresponds to a case where people would normally garden path.","The decision of paying particular attention to the problem of analyzing ill-formed sentences is motivated by the intended application of the parser. In fact it is included in a larger system, which allows the user to interact in natural lan guage with a relational data base (Siklossy, Lesmo & Torasso 83, Lesmo, Siklossy & Torasso 83). Various systems have been developed in the last years, which act as N.L. interfaces to data bases (Harris 77, Waltz 78, Konolige 80) and all of them pointed out the necessity of having at disposal mechanisms for handling ill-formed inputs (mainly ellipsis).","In the following some example sentences will be discussed; they refer both to the implemented system and to more general sentences. This is ju~ tified, because the linguistic coverage of the perser is wider than the one required by a data base interface, even if the data base, the seman tic knowledge and the lexicon are restricted to\" a particular domain. AN EXAMPLE OF THE PARSER'S RESULT","Before describing the parser control struc ture, it is worth having a look at the final re~ resentation of the input sentence which is prod~ ced by the parser. It consists in a tree which represents the relationships existing among the constituents of the input sentence according to the \"head and modifier\" approach (Winograd 83, pag.73) °. An example of such a tree is reported in fig.l.","It may be noticed that the tree is a case re£ resentation of the sentence: in the verbal nodes","o This structure might be related to the \"synta~ tic/semantic shape representation of RUS (Sidner et al. 81), but we are not sure. if5"]},{"title":"RELI","paragraphs":["CONNI"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["REF2 REL2 REF3 ADJI Fig. l - Result of the analysis of the sentence: CONN4 ~ CONN~-~"]},{"title":"kCONN7","paragraphs":["]UNMARKED~t I IUNMARKEDI+II~ RE~ REF5 REF7"]},{"title":"[CHEIH ] I'ES~E[t[H']t[ IDA","paragraphs":["REF6 £"]},{"title":"[FISICAIH;","paragraphs":["\"Quali sono gli studenti di sesso maschile che hanno sostenuto l'esame di Fisica in data 18/1/83?\" (Who are the students of male sex who passed the test of Physics on 18/1/83?).

Whereas the other slots are \"filled\" when the needed piece of information is available (normally this happens when the head of the verb is scanned), the ROLE slots are d~ namically created when a given constituent is attached to the REL node (with the exception of AUX and H);","- some slots are redundant, since their contents can be deduced by traversing the tree. For exam pie, the contents of the slot DEPEND and of the field SPECIAL of the ROLE slot can be obtained on the basis of the LINKUP node and of the first case of the clause respectively. They have been included for the sake of efficiency;","- the sole input word of the example sentence which does not appear in a node of fig.l is the auxiliary \"hanno\". Auxiliaries have been consid ered as components of the verb, so that their presence is signalled only by means of an AUX role. The actual auxiliary, its tense, its num ber, etc. are deducible from the contents of the other slots of the REL node.","The different types of nodes which have been defined are listed in Table i.","As stated in the introduction, the system should act a~ a natural language front-end for a relational data base. The structure reported in fig.l is the basis for performing the semantic checks and for translating the sentence in a rela tional algebra expression (Date 81) which corr~ spond to the input query. As will be described in the following sections, neither the semantic checks nor the actual translation of the query are done at the end of the syntactic analysis; in fact the semantic checks are performed when a node is filled with a content word and the translation is obtained in an incremental way from the constit~ ents occurring in the tree. For instance, the s~ mantic check procedures will be triggered when the word \"sesso\" (sex) is encountered and the corre spending REF node is created, linked and filled to verify that the students have a sex (or, more precisely, that the sequence \"studente di sesso\" is acceptable).","As regards the translation, it is worth n~ ricing that it does not represent the interpret~ tion of the given node, but the data base inter pretation of the whole constituent headed by that node; for this reason it is obtained by combining the translations of all depending constituents. Let us consider, for example, the node REF2. The translation associated with CONN3 is","(join %s tudent (select &sex ((~sex eq m))) ($student eq ~person)) The translation associated with REL2 is","(select &pass ((~course eq Fisiea) (~date eq 18/1/83))) The resulting translation associated with REF2 i3","(join (join %student","(select &sex ((~sex eq m)))","($student eq ~person))","(select &pass (($course eq Fisica)","(~date eq 18/1/83)))","(~student eq ~student)) A detailed description of the way this translation is obtained is reported in (Lesmo, Siklossy, Tora h so 83). However, for the sake of clarity it is im portant to say that %student is the unary relation whose unique attribute is ~student and which co~ tains the names of all the students whose data are stored in the data base; &sex is a binary relation (attributes Sperson and ~sex) containing the sex of all the persons known to the system; finally &pass is the relation (attributes ~student, ~course, ~grade, ~date) where are stored the re suits of the tests passed by the students. The translation which have been shown are stored in the TRANSL slot of the associated nodes. 117 THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS","The tree described in the previous section is built by means of a set of rules of the form condi tion-action. With each syntactic category a subset of these rules is associated: when an input word of the given category is encountered in the input sen tence, then the subset of rules associated with that category is activated and the conditions are evaluated. The conditions involve tests on the cur rent structure of the tree (i.e. the \"status\" of the analysis) and may request a one-word lookahead. If just one rule is selected (i.e. all other condi tions evaluate to false), its action part is exe cured. An action consists in the construction of new nodes, in their filling up with particular val ues (normally depending on the input word) and in their attachment to the already existing tree. In table 2 are reported as an example some of the rules of the packet associated with the category ADJECTIVE. The rules which are not reported handle the cases of predicative adjectives and adjective~ preceded by adverbs. In some of the rules a one-word lookahea~is used; it allows the parser to build the right structure in virtually all simple cases. In fact, even if the semantic knowledge source does not affect the choice of the rule, it can trigger the natural ch~l~nges, which modify the tree; these changes substitute the backup in many of the cases wher~the hypothesized syntactic struc ture does not satisfy the semantic constraints.","An example of a sentence portion which otto, can be disambiguated only by inspecting the seman tic constraints is the following: ... - Determiner - Noun ~ Adjective - Noun - ... In this case the adjective may modify either the preceding or the following noun. Consider the sen tences $4 and $5°: Per le persone anziane bevande ghiacciate ($4) sono dannose (For old people icy-cold drinks are harmful) Si arrampicano sulle montagne agili scalatori ($5) (Agile cragsmen cramble up the mountains) The strategy adopted by the parser is to attach the node representing the adjective to a newly created REF node which will be filled when the second noun is analyzed (see the action part of Rule 4 in tab. 2). In case the semantics reject this choice (se~ tence $4) a natural change is triggered; it discon nects the adjectival node and moves it back to the REF node which represents the first noun.","° The sequence of categories given in the text corresponds to \"... le persone anziane bevande ...\" in $4 and to \"... le montagne agili scala tori ...\" in $5.","RULE I COND : CURRENT CONN","ACTION: CRLINK REF CONN","CRLINK ADJ REF","FILL ADJ","RULE 2 CON'D: UNFILLED REF or","(CURFILL ADJ and NEXT # NOUN)","ACTION: CRLINK ADJ REF","FILL ADJ RULE 4 COND: ACTION: (CURFILL REF or CURRENT NIL or CURRENT REL) and NEXT = NOUN CRLINK CONN REL FILL CONN 'UNMARKED CRLINK REF CONN CRLINK ADJ REF FILL ADJ","Table 2 - Some of the rules associated with the sY_nn","tactic category ADJECTIVE.","The predicates used in the conditions are","CURRENT X: TRUE if the current node is of type X.","UNFILLED X: TRUE if the current node or the node above is of type X and it is not filledyet.","CURFILL X: TRUE if the current node is of type X and is filled.","NEXT CAT: is a lookahead function which returns TRUE if the category of the next word in the input string is CAT.","The structure-building functions used in","the actions are","CRLINK XI X2: creates a new node of type XI and links it to a node of type X2. The node which must be used is located by moving up on the rightmost branch of the tree.","FILL X VAL: a node of type X (located as in CRLINK) is filled with the value VAL (~ denotes the normalized form of the current word).","In general, however, it is not possible to void the use of backup. The backup mechanism is needed when more than one of the conditions of the rules associated with a particular category is matched, but this case is actually restricted to very complex (and unusual) relative clauses. More often, the backup is required when the input word is ambiguous, i.e. it belongs to more than one sy~ tactic categories. In this case all conditions a~ sociated with the different categories are evalu ated an~ in some cases more than one of them is matched. In all these cases the status of the ana lysis is saved (i.e. the current tree) together with the identifiers of the matched rules and a pointer to the input sentence. As an example of sentences in which the bac h i18 up mechanism is used consider the sentences $6-$8; in them there is a lexical ambiguity for the word \"che\" (it acts as a relative pronoun in $6, as a conjunction in S7 and as an adjectival modifier in $8); moreover in $6 and S7 \"pesca\" is a form of the verb \"pescare\" (to fish) whereas in $8 it is a noun (the fishing). Di a quel ragazzo ehe pesca di andarsene ($6) (Tell that boy who is fishing to go away) Di a quel ragazzo che pesca male ($7) (Tell that boy that he is fishing badly) DI a quel ragazzo che pesca fantastica"]},{"title":"(s8)","paragraphs":["hai fatto (Tell that boy what a marvel lous fishing you have done). THE VERIFICATION PROCESS","When a node is filled, it is supposed to be already attlched to the tree. The filling opera lion triggers some procedures associated with the type of the node which is being filled. Among them, the AGREEMENT procedures have the task of checking person, number and gender agreement between a node and its dependants. Particularly important is the agreement procedure associated with the REL node type, because it selects the REF node which can act as syntactic subject of the sentence (this suggestion may be overcome later by virtue of se mantic considerations). If the agreement con straints are violated, then the natural changes are attempted; if no restructuring of the tree is successful, then the initial status is maintained without changes and a warning message is issued.","Perhaps, among the procedures triggered by the filling of a node, the one which have the most dramatic effects on the subsequent behavior of the system is the semantic check procedure. In fact, if the outcome of the semantic check procedure re ports the non-admissibility of an attachment, the parser is forced to find another alternative. This is done by first applying the natural changes and then, if all of them fail, by performing a backup. A semantic procedure refers to the semantic know ledge of the domain under consideration, which is stored in form of a two-level network (Lesmo, \"iklossy & Torasso 83); the external level allows to perform the checks, whereas the internal level carries the information necessary to perform the translation.","Different checks are done depending on the type of the node. When an ADJ node is attached to a REF node, the system has to verify that the ad jective is an acceptable linguistic description of the noun stored in the REF node. In case two REF nodes are attached (this case occurs in Italian only when the lower REF contains a proper noun) the system has to verify that the lower REF con rains a possible identifier of the class represen~ ed by the noun stored in the upper REF.When two REFs are attached via a CONN node, the constituent headed by the lower REF has the purpose either of specifying a subset of the class identified by the noun stored in the upper REF or to refer to a pro~ erty of a given object. An example of the first kind is \"the professors of the department X\" and an example of the second kind is \"the sex of the professors ...\". In this case the semantic proc~ dure accesses the net to reject incorrect specif! cations of the form \"the sex of the department X\". A quite different behavior characterizes the at tachment of a role to a verb (a REF node to a REL node via a CONN node); of course, the attachment of a new case cannot trigger a simple case check, but must take into account also all the cases at tached before. A side effect of this process is the binding of the actual cases to the cases pr~ dieted in the net; this can be useful when there are two cases which have the same marker (or which are both unmarked) to determine, by using the se lectional restrictions stored in the net, the actu al role of the filler of each case (e.g. syntactic subject or syntactic object).","The completion of a constituent triggers the last set of syntactic rules; they verify whether the constituent (that is the node itself and its descendants) respects the ordering constraints. In case those constraints are violated (e.g. \"belli i bambini sono\" - nice the babies are) a warning mes sage is issued but the sentence is considered as interpretable.","A word is due to explain the meaning of the term \"complete\". The constituent headed by the node n° is considered as complete when a new node","i n. is attached to a node n k which is an ancestor gf ni; all constituents headed by the nodes b~ longing to the rightmost path of the tree are con sidered as complete when the system encounters the end of the sentence. The concept of \"completion\" of a constituent is particularly important because only when the constituent headed by the node n. is","i complete the system translates the constituent by using different pieces of information gathered by thesemantic procedures and stores the translation in the TRANSL slot of the node n..","1 NATURAL CHANGES VERSUS BACKUP","The natural changes have the purpose of re structuring the tree by moving around constituents without requiring backup. They are represented as pattern-action rules, where the pattern part is used to select the rules which can be applied, whereas the action part implements the transforma lion of the tree. The natural changes currently im plemented are of two main types: - MOVE UP (the easiest and most common): it at 119"]},{"title":"REL1","paragraphs":["( ESSERE[ t["]},{"title":"Ht'~ I CONN1 .r \"CONN2$ l tl 1 UN R.EPkl","paragraphs":["REFI ~ REF2 ~\""]},{"title":"ISTUDENTEI+I HIll","paragraphs":["DE~'~C~ REF3 ADJI ~ REL2"]},{"title":"L SCHXLEi [","paragraphs":["(a) CONN4 W \"I RELI"]},{"title":"[EssE [ JHtr[","paragraphs":["CONNI ~ i )CONN2"]},{"title":"°% (b)","paragraphs":["Fig.4 - Example of the use of a MOVE UP natural change.

For example; a MOVE UP rule is used to build the tree shown in fig.l: the relative clause \"che hanno sostenuto ...\" is firstly attached to the nearest REF node (\"sesso\"); when the verb is found the node REL2 is filled (fig.4a), the agreement and semantic check procedures are triggered and this latter re turns that \"sesso\" cannot fill an unmarked case of \"sostenere\", so that the partially built relative clause is moved up to REF2 (\"studente\" - fig.4b); this new hypothesis is validated by the agreement and semantic procedures. An example of the'applic~ tion of a MOVE BACK rule has been given in the third section, in connection with the problem of attaching the adjectival nodes (see fig.5).","As stated in the previous section, the natural changes do not substitute in all cases the backup mechanism; the backup is strictly connected with the concept of \"garden path\".

When the word \"bevande\" (drinks) is scanned the node ADJI is MOVED BACK from REF2 (a) to the last REF node of the previous branch of the tree, i.e. REFI (b). is able to parse sentences in a deterministic way when they are not garden paths. However it has been shown (Milne 82) that: - For a pair of potential garden path sentences, it","is not possible to uniquely determine which is a","garden path and which is not (different people may choose in different ways). - The choice of having a n-constituent lookahead","(as in PARSIFAL) does not allow to decide whether","a sentence is a potential garden path in a psych~","logically plausible way. -","The semantic knowledge plays a fundamental role","in choosing a particular analysis. Milne argues that a one-word lookahead, with the substantial help of semantic information is what is needed to provide a model of N.L. which is psych~ logically sound (one-word lookahead plus semantics is also advocated in RUS - Braehman et al. - 79).","We think that the approach adopted in our pa~ ser basically agrees with this position. In a rat~ er vague sense, the non-complete nodes of our tree correspond with the Active Node Stack, i.e. with the not yet completed constituents of the sentence. The natural changes allow to operate on these nodes on the basis of semantic information. However there is a fundamental difference: our parser has at dis posal the whole structure built previously. An e~ ample of the possibility of using non-active co~ stituents is given by the MOVE BACK natural changes where a previou$constituent (already completed) ~s used to attach a node (see REFI in fig.5). This greater flexibility has the disadvantage of not gi~ ing any cue for deciding a-priori what is a valid natural change and what is not (it is possible to devise natural changes for all possible kinds of restructuring of the tree); however, it allows to 120 -choose heuristics which are in agreement with the actual behavior of humans and which fit in a simple way in the proposed model.","As regards the use of backup, the cited works do not give an account of what happens in the pal set when an analysis fails due to a garden path (see, however, Marcus 80, pp.202-220). Our prov! sional solution is to use the backup, a computation al tool heavier than the natural changes: it should correspond to the situation when \"the user must ton","m sciously undo this previous choice after detect ing an inconsistency\" (woods 73, pag.133). We ac knowledge the problems associated with this choice, e.g. the need of saving at some times the status of the analysis, the possibility of interference with the natural changes, etc., but the backup is used parsimoniously (due to the condition part of the syntactic rules) and, anyway, we do not believe it is the final solution to this problem. CONCLUDING REMARKS","The paper describes a parser for a large sub set of Italian. The novel control structure in volves the use of natural changes which restructure the tree representing the status of the analysis without the intervention of the backup mechanism. This allows the system to operate in a pseudo-dete~ ministic way, in that the use of backup is limited to sentences which could make people garden path.","Another major feature of the parser is its a bility to cope with some kinds of ill-formedness of the input sentences. This is obtained by a decomp~ sition of the syntactic knowledge into two levels: the first level contains structure building rules, whereas the second level contains rules of agree ment and rules related with the ordering of constit uents. This structuring of the syntactic knowledge allows the parser to be data driven: the scanning of a new input word produces its insertion into the analysis tree; this may be seen as an hypothesis of interpretation, which can be accepted or rejected later on the basis of other independent knowledge sources. This allows the system to avoid the use of classical rewriting rules or transition networks which represent in an integrated way all syntactic constraints.","As stated in the introduction, the authors are developing a N.L. interface to a relational data base. The lexical analyzer and the access proce dures to the network representing the semantic con straints are running, the construction rules and the natural changes are being debugged, whereas the ordering rules are under development. The transla tion into the actual data base query is running. The system is written in FRANZ LISP and runs on a VAX 11/780 under the UNIX operating system.
