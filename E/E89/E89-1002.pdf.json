But despite the tidiness of such derivational uniqueness, there seems to be no a priori reason to assume that a gramma r must have this property. If a grammar exhibits derivational equivalence, whereby distinct derivations of a string assign the same meanings, naive exhaustive search for all derivations will be redundant, and quite possibly intractable. In this paper we show how notions of derivation-reduction and normal form can be used to avoid unnecessary work while parsing with grammars exhibiting derivational equivalence. With grammar regarded as analogous to logic, derivations are proofs; what we are advocat-ing is proof-reduction, and normal form proof; the invocation of these logical techniques adds a further paragraph to the story of parsing-as-deduction."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["The phenomenon of derivational equivalence is most evident in work on generalised categorial grammars, where it has been referred to as ~spurious ambiguity'. It has been argued that the capacity to assign left-branching, and therefore incrementally interpretable, analyses makes these grammars of particular psychological interest. We will illustrate our methodology by reference to generalised categorial grammars using a combinatory logic (as opposed to say, lambda-calculus) semantics.

For example, suppose that a grammar is capable of characterising right extraposition of an object's adjunct to clause-final position. Then sentences such as Joha met a man yesterday who swims will be generated. But it is probable that the same grammar will assign Joha met a maa who swims a right extraposition derivation in which the relative clause happens to occupy its normal posi-tion in the string; the normal and right extraposition derivations generate the same strings with the same meanings, so there is derivational equivalence.

As well as it being inefficient to search through derivations which are equivalent, the exponential figure signifies computational intractability.","Several suggestions have been made in relation to this problem. Pareschi and Steedman (1987) describe what they call a 'lazy chart parser' intended to yield only one of each set of equivalent analyses by adopting a reduce-first parsing strategy, and invoking a special recovery procedure to avoid the backtracking that this strategy would otherwise necessitate. But Hepple (1987) shows that their algorithm is incomplete.","Wittenburg (1987) presents an approach in which a combinatory grammar is compiled into one not exhibiting derivational equivalence. Such compilation seeks to avoid the problem of parsing with a grammar exhibiting derivational equivalence by arranging that the grammar used on-line does not have this property. The concern here however is management of parsing when the grammar used on-line does have the problematic property.","Karttunen (1986) suggests a strategy in which every potential new edge is tested against the chart to see whether an existing analysis spanning the same region is equivalent. If one is found, the new analysis is discarded. However, because this check requires comparison with every edge spanning the relevant region, checking time increases with the number of such edges.","The solution we offer is one in which there is a notion of normal form derivation, and a set of contraction rules which reduce derivations to their normal forms, normal form derivations being those to which no contraction rule can apply. The contraction rules might be used in a number of ways (e.g. to transform one derivation into another, rather than recompute from the start, cf. Pareschi and Steedman). The possibility emphasised here is one in which we ensure that a processing step does not create a non-normal form derivation. Any such derivation is dispensable, assuming exhaustive search: the normal form derivation to which it is equivalent, and which won't be excluded, will yield the same result. Thus the equivalence check can be to make sure that each derivation computed is a normal form, e.g. by checking that no step creates a form to which a contraction rule can apply. Un-like Karttunen's subsumption check this test does not become slower with the size of a chart. The test to see whether a derivation is normal form involves nothing but the derivation itself and the invarlant definition of normal form.","The next section gives a general outline of reduction and normal forms. This is followed by an illustration in relation to typed combinatory logic, where we emphasise that the reduction constitutes a proof-reduction. We then describe how the notions can be applied to combinatory grammar to handle the problem of parsing and derivational equivalence, and we again note that if derivations are regarded as proofs, the method is an instantia-tion of proof-reduction."]},{"title":"Reduction and Normal Form","paragraphs":["It is a common state of affairs for some terms of a language to be equivalent in that for the intended semantics, their interpretations are the same in all models. In such a circumstance it can be useful to elect normal forms which act as unique representatives of their equivalence class. For example, if terms can be transformed into normal forms, equivalence between terms can be equated with identity of normal forms. 1 The usual way of defining normal forms is by","1For our purposes 'identity I can mean exact syntactic identity, and this simplifies discussion somewhat; in a system with bound variables such as the lambda-calculus, identity would mean identity up to renaming of bound variables. - 12defining a relation l> ('contracts-to') of CONTRAC-TION between equivalent terms; a term X is said to be in NORMAL FORM if and only if there is no term Y such that X 1> Y.

Because normal forms only reduce to themselves and P and Q are distinct, there is no term to which P and Q can both reduce. But C-R tells us that if P = Q, then there/a a term to which they can both reduce. And suppose that a term X has distinct normal forms P and Q; then X = P, X = Q, and P -- Q. But by the first corollary, for distinct normal forms P and Q, P ~ Q.","We have established that if two terms have the same normal form then they are equal and (given C-R) that if they have different normal forms then they are not equal, and that normal forms are unique. Suppose we also have the following property: (16) Strong Normalisation (SN): Every reduction is finite. This has the corollary (normalisation) that every term has a normal form. A sufficient condition to demonstrate SN would be to find a metric which assigns to each term a finite non-negative integer score, and to show that each application of a contraction decrements the score by a non-zero integral amount. It follows that any reduction of a term must be finite. Given both C-R and SN, equality is decidable: we can reduce any terms to their normal forms in a finite number of steps, and compare for identity."]},{"title":"Norxizal Form and Proof-Reduction in Combinatory Logic","paragraphs":["In the CL case, note for example the following equivalence (omitting types for the moment): (17) B probably ~ walks ~ John ~ -- probably ~ (walks' John #) We may have the following contraction rules: (18) a.

A form on the left is called a REDEX, the form on the right, its CONTRACTUM. To see the validity of the contraction relation defined (and the soundness of the consequent equality), note that the functional interpretations of a redex and a contractum are the same, and that by compositional ity, the interpretation of a term is unchanged by substitution of a subterm for an occurrence of a subterm with the same interpretation.

In fact the type schemes of the basic combinators in (2), together with a modus ponens rule corresponding to the application in (3b), provide an axiomatisation of relevant implication (see Morrill and Carpenter, 1987, for discussion in relation to grammar):","(20) a.

Corresponding to the term-reduction and normal form in (19), there is proof-reduction and a normal form for a proof over the language of types (see e.g. Hindley and Seldin, 1986). There can be proof-contraction rules such as the following:","(21) B N M P","m ~","~","m (B-+C)-+(A-~B)-+A-+C B-*C A-+B A (A-+B)-+A-+C A-+C c N M P B--~C A--,B A 1> B c","Proof-reduction originated with Prawitz (1965) and is now a standard technique in logic. The suggestion of this paper is that if parse trees labelled with categories can be regarded as proofs over the language of categories, then the problem of parsing and derivational equivalence can be treated on the pattern of proof-reductlon.","Before proceeding to the grammar cases, a couple of remarks are in order. The equivalence addressed by the reductions above is not strong (extensional), but what is called weak equivalence. For example the following pairs (whose types have been omitted) are distinct weak normal forms, but are extensionally equivalent: (22) a. B (B probablyanecessarily l) walks l b. B probablyW(B necessarilylwalks s) (23) a. B I walks I b. walks' Strong equivalence and reduction is far more complex than weak equivalence and reduction, but unfortunately it is the former which is appropriate for the grammars. Later examples will thus differ in this respect from the one above. A second difference is that in the example above, combinators are axioms, and there is a single rule of application. In the grammar cases combinators are rules. Finally, grammar derivations have both a phono-logical interpretation (dependent on the order of the words), and a semantic interpretation. Since no derivations are equivalent if they produce a different sequence of words, derivation reduction must always preserve word order."]},{"title":"Normal Form and Proof-Reduction in Combinatory Grammar","paragraphs":["Consider a combinatory grammar containing the application rules, Forward Composition, and also Subject Type-Raising (24); the latter two enable association of a subject with an incomplete verb phrase; this is required in (25), as shown in"]},{"title":"(26).","paragraphs":["(24) Subject Type-Raising (>T) T: NP =~ S/(S\\NP) (where T y x = x y) (25) a.

So far as we are aware, the relations of reduction and equality generated observe the C-R corollaries that distinct normal forms are non-equal, and that normal forms are unique. We provid e the following reasoning to the effect that SN holds.","Assign to each derivation a score, depending on its binary and unary branching tree structure as follows: (28) a.

If a subtree has score z then a unary-branching tree formed from it has score 2z All derivations will have a finite score of at least 1. Consider the scores for the redex and contractum in each of the above. Let z, y, and z be the scores for the subtrees dominated by the leaves in left-to-right order. For I>1, the score of the redex is 2(2z÷y)÷z and that of its contractum is 2z-t-(2y + z): a decrement of 2z, and this is always non-zero because all scores are at least 1. The case of 1>2 is the same. In I>s the score of the redex is 2(2z) -t- y, that of the contractum 2~-t-y: also a proper decrement. So all reductions are finite, and there is the corollary that all derivations have normal forms.","Since all derivations have normal forms, we can safely limit attention in parsing to normal form derivations: for all the derivations excluded, there is an equivalent normal form which is not excluded. If not all derivations had normal forms, limitation to normal forms might lose those derivations in the grammar which do not have normal forms. The strategy to avoid unnecessary work can be to discontinue any derivation that contains a redex.
