For that purpose, we have designed a language called DISLOG. DISLOG stands for programming in logic with discontinuities and permits to express in a simple, concise and declarative way relations or constraints between non-contiguous elements in a structure. DISLOG is also weel adapted to model other types of linguistic phenomena like Quantifier Raising involving long-distance relations or constraints. 1. Introduction","Many areas of natural language syntax and semantics are a fruitful source of inspiration for computer languages and systems designers. The complexity of natural language and the high level of abstraction of most linguistic and semantic theories have motivated the emergence of highly abstract and transparent programming languages. One of the most striking examples is undoubtedly Prolog, initially designed for natural language parsing, via Metamorphosis Grammars (Colmerauer 1978).","For a few years, the Logic Programming paradigm has been augmented with a number of technical and formal devices designed to extend its expressive power. New logic programming languages have emerged, several of them motivated by natural language processing problems. Among them let us mention: CIL (Mukai 1985), designed to express in a direct way concepts of Situation Semantics, MOLOG (Farinas et al. 1985), an extension to Prolog designed to specify in a very simple and declarative way the semantics of modal operators and ~,-Prolog (Nadathur and Miller 1988), designed to deal with X-expressions and X-reduction.","Recently, the Logic Programming paradigm has been augmented with the concept of"]},{"title":"constrained logic programming","paragraphs":["(CLP). The basic research done within this area amounts to specifying tools for a more refined control on the type of values or terms a","variable in a program can stand for. Answers to goals can be intensional: they are sets of equations (constraints) rather than mere values. Furthermore, the idea at the operational level, incorrect assignments are filtered out as soon as they are encountered when building a proof, making thus proof procedures more efficient.","In this document, we deal with a new, original, type of CLP mechanism: constraints on proof trees. This type of constraint has emerged from, in particular, the definition of a computational model for the quantifier raising operation and for movement theory in Government and Binding theory (noted hereafter as GB). We model those phenomena in terms of constraints between non-contiguous elements in a structure. For example, we want to express constraints between a moved constituent and its co-indexed trace. Constraints are expressed in terms of relations between subtrees in a syntactic tree or in terms of relations between parenthetized constituents in the now more commonly adopted annotated surface forms of sentences.","We have designed Dislog, programming in logic with discontinuities, which permits to express relations between non-contiguous elements in a structure in a simple, declarative and concise way. Dislog is an extension to Prolog; its procedural and declarative semantics are given in (Saint-Dizier 1988b), computer applications like compiler writing and planning are given in (Saint-Dizier 1988a), its use in natural language parsing for free-phrase order languages is given in (Saint-Dizier 1987). In the present document we will focus on modelling movement theory in GB (Chomsky 1982, 1986) and Quantifier Raising (May 1986), which have been in the past two years our main guidelines to specify Dislog. We do not have in mind to build a complete model of GB theory, but we feel that the transfer of some of its main principles and results to the field of natural language processing is worth investigating and is very promising for reasons we will develop hereafter. We are also convinced that GB principles should be paired with other approaches of AI to deal, for example, with the lexicon, lexical semantics, ~,_~ - 87 - feature representation and control systems and, finally, logical form construction. 2. Movement Theory in GB","In this section, we briefly summarize the main aspects of movement theory (Chomsky 1982, 1986) and give several examples. GB theory is a complete revision of the baroque set of rules and transformations of the standard theory, achieving a much greater expressive power and explanatory adequacy. GB theory is composed of a very small base component (which follows X-bar syntax), a single movement rule and a small set of principles whose role is to control the power of the movement rule. GB exhibits a greater clarity, ease of understanding and linguistic coverage (in spite of some points which remain obscure). The recent formalization of GB theory has several attractive properties for the design of a computational model of natural language processing, among which:","-concision and economy of means,","- high degree of parametrization,","-modularity (e.g. independence of filtering principles),","- declarativity (e.g. no order in the application of rules),","-absence of intermediate structures (e.g. no deep slructure).","GB theory postulates four levels: d-structure (sometimes not taken into account, like in our approach), s-structure (surface form of structural description), phonetic form (PF) and logical form (LF). The latter two levels are derived independently from s-structure. We will be mainly interested here in the s-structure level. Movement theory being also applicable, with different parameter values, to LF, we will also show how our approach is well-adapted to characterize LF level from s-structure level. 2.1 Move-cx and constraints","In GB, grammaticality of a sentence is based on the existence of a well-formed annotated surface form of that sentence. Thus, no real movements of constituents occur and additional computational and representational problems are avoided. Up to now very few and only partial works have been undertaken to model principles of GB theory. Among them, let us mention (Berwick and Weinberg 1986), (Stabler 1987) and (Brown et al. 1987). There is however an increasing interest for this approach. GB theory postulates a single movement - 88 - rule, more-a, controlled by principles and filters. This very general rule states:","Move any constituent a to any position.","The most immediate constraints are that tx is moved to the left to an empty position (a subject position which is not 0-marked) or is adjoined to a COMP or INFL node (new positions are created from nothing, but this not in contradiction with the projection principle). Constraints and filters control movement but they also force movement. For example, when a verb is used in the passive voice, it can no longer assign case to its object. The object NP must thus move to a place where it is assigned case. The (external) subject 0-role being also suppressed, the object NP naturally moves to the subject position, where it is assigned case, while keeping its previous 0-role.","Another immediate constraint is the 0-criterion: each argument has one and only one 0-role and each 0-role is assigned to one and only one argument. Such roles are lexically induced by means of the projection principle (and by lexical insertion), confering thus an increasing role to lexical subeategorization. Finally, government gives a precise definition of what a constituent can govern and thus how the projection principled is handled.","Move-ix is too abstract to be directly implementable. It needs to be at least partially instantiated, in a way which preserves its generality and its explanatory power. In addition, while the theory is attaining higher and higher levels of adequacy, the interest for analysing the specifics of particular constructions is decreasing. As a consequence, we have to make explicit elements left in the shade or just neglected. Finally, the feature system implicit in GB theory has also to be integrated. 2.2 Examples of movements","All the examples given below are expressed within the framework of head-initial languages like French and English. Let us first consider the relative clause construction. In a relative clause, an N is pronominalized and moved to the left and adjoined to a COMP node. A trace of N is left behind and co-indexed with the pronominalized N: (1) [COMP N(+Pro)i ........ [N2 trace i ] ...... ] as in: [COMP thati John met IN2 trace i ] yesterday ] Where i is the co-indexation link.","The case of the passive construction is a little more complicated and needs to be explained. An object NP is moved to a subject position because the passivisation of the verb no longer allows the verb to assign case to its object NP and a 0-role to its subject NP (in an indirect manner):","at d-structure we have, for example:","[ [NP ] [INFL gives [ N2 a book ] ] ] and at s-structure we have:"]},{"title":"[ [NP","paragraphs":["a booki ] [INFL is given [N2 tracei ] ].","At d-structure, the subject NP is here not mentioned. In a passive construction, the subject is not moved to a PP position (by N2). 0-roles are redistributed when the verb is passivized (this illustrates once again the prominent role played by the lexical description and the projection principle) and a by-complement with the previous 0-role of the subject NP is created.","Another example is the subject-to-subject raising operation, where: It seems that Jane is on time becomes: Jane seems to be on time.","Jane moves to a position without 0-role (it is not 0-marked by seem ). When the clause is on time is in the infinitive form then the subject NP position is no longer case-marked, forcing Jane to move:","[INFL Janei seem [COMP lracei [VP to be on time ] ] ] Finally, let us consider the wh-construal","construction occuring at logical form (I.F) (May 86).","The representation of: Who saw what ? is at s-structure: [COMP2 [COMP whoi ] [INFL tracei saw'[N","what ] ] ] and becomes at IF: [COMP2 [COMP whatj ] [COMP whoi ] ] [INFL","tracei saw tracej ] ]. Both what and who are adjoined to a COMP node.","This latter type of movement is also restricted by a small number of general principles based on the type of landing site a raised quantifier may occupy and on the nature of the nodes a quantifier can cross over when raised. The first type of constraint will be directly expressed in rules by means of features; the latter will be dealt with in section 5 devoted to Bounding theory, where a model of the subjacency constraint is presented."]},{"title":"2.3 Towards a computational expression of movements","paragraphs":["Movements have to be expressed in a simple computational way. Let us consider the relative clause construction (wh-movement in general), all the other examples can be expressed in the same way.","Relative clause construction can be expressed in a declarative Way by stating, very informally, that: within the domain of a COMP, an N(+Pro) is adjoined to that COMP and somewhere else in that domain an N2 is derived into a trace co-indexed with that N(+Pro). The notion of domain associated to a node like COMP refers to Bounding theory and will be detailed in section 5, the constraint on the co-existence in that domain of an N(+Pro) adjoined to a COMP and, somewhere else, of an N2 derived into a trace can directly be expressed by constraints on syntactic trees, and, thus, by constraints on proof trees in an operational framework.

Perspectives","In this paper, we have presented a simple, declarative computational model for movement theory in Government and Binding. For that purpose, we have introduced Dislog, a logic programming language built on top of Prolog, designed to express in a simple, transparent and concise way relations or constraints between non-contiguous constituents in a structure. Although Dislog is still in an early stage of development, it seems a promising language for natural language processing and also to represent and to program several kinds of problems where the idea of non-contiguity is involved. The efficient implementation we have carried out permits to use Dislog on a large scale. We have designed a prototype parser which includes our model of movement rules, the GB base component, a quite extensive lexicon and semantic compositional rules to build logical formulas. We also use the same model for natural language generation.","Acknowledgements","I would like to thank A. Borillo, M. Borillo, C. Brown, V. Dahl, C. Delannay, G. Lapalme, P. Sebillot and J.
