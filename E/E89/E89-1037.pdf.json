The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis. INTRODUCTION In this paper we sketch an approach to machine translation that offers several advantages compared to many of the other strategies currently being pursued. We define the relationship between the linguistic structures of the source and target languages in terms of a set of correspondence functions instead of providing derivational or procedural techniques for converting source into target. This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic abstraction while still preserving the modularity of linguistic components and of source and target grammars and lexicons. Our conceptual framework depends on notions of structure, structural description, and structural correspondence. In the following sections we outline these basic notions and show how they can be used to deal with certain interesting translation problems in a simple and straightforward way. In its emphasis on description-based techniques, our approach shares some fundamental features with the one proposed by Kay (1984), but we use an explicit projection mechanism to separate out and organize the intra- and inter-language components.","Most existing translation systems are either transfer-based or interlingua-based. Transfer-based systems usually specify a single level of representation or abstraction at which transfer is supposed to take place. A source string is analyzed into a structure at that level of representation, a transfer program then converts this into a target structure at the same level, and the target string is then generated from this structure. Interlingua-based systems on the other hand require that a source string has to be analyzed into a structure that is identical to a structure from which a target string has to be generated.","Without further constraints, each of these approaches could in principle be successful, An interlingual representation could be devised, for example, to contain whatever information is needed to make all the appropriate distinctions for all the sentences in all the languages under consideration. Similarly, a transfer structure could be arbitrarily configured to allow for the contrastive analysis of any two particular languages. It seems unlikely that systems based on such an undisciplined arrangement of information will ever succeed in practice. Indeed, most translation researchers have based their systems on representations that have some more general and independent motivation. The levels of traditional linguistic analysis {phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, etc.) are attractive because they provide structures with well-defined and coherent properties, but a single one of these - 272 - levels does not contain all the information needed for adequate translation. The D-structure level of Government-Binding theory, for example, contains information about the predicate-argument relations of a clause but says nothing about the surface constituent order that is necessary to accurately distinguish between old and new information or topic and comment. As another example, the functional structures of Lexical-Functional Grammar do not contain the ordering information necessary to determine the scope of quantifiers or other operators.","Our proposal, as it is set forth below, allows us to state simultaneous correspondences between several levels of source-target representations, and thus is neither interlingual nor transfer-based. We can achieve modularity of linguistic specifications, by not requiring conceptually different kinds of linguistic information to be combined into a single structure. Yet that diverse information is still accessible to determine the set of target strings that adequately translate a source string. We also achieve modularity of a more basic sort: our correspondence mechanism permits contrastive transfer rules that depend on but do not duplicate the specifications of independently motivated grammars of the source and target languages (Isabelle and Macklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind, 1986).","A GENERAL ARCHITECTURE FOR LINGUISTIC DESCRIPTIONS Our approach uses the equality- and description-based mechanisms of Lexical-Functional Grammar. As introduced by Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), lexical-functional grammar assigns to every sentence two levels of syntactic representation, a constituent structure (c-structure) and a functional structure (f-structure). These structures are of different formal types--the c-structure is a phrase-structure tree while the f-structure is a hierarchical finite function--and they characterize different aspects of the information carried by the sentence. The c-structure represents the ordered arrangement of words and phrases in the sentence while the f-structure explicitly marks its grammatical functions (subject, object, etc.). For each type of structure there is a special notation or description-language in which the properties of desirable instances of that type can be specified. Constituent structures are described by standard context-free rule notation (augmented with a variety of abbreviatory devices that do not change its generative power), while f-structures are described by Boolean combinations of function-argument equalities stated over variables that denote the structures of interest. Kaplan and Bresnan assumed a correspondence function mapping between the nodes in the c-structure of a sentence and the units of its f-structure, and used that piecewise function to produce a description of the f-structure (in its equational language) by virtue of the mother-daughter, order, and category relations of the c-structure.","The formal picture developed by Kaplan and Bresnan, as clarified in Kaplan (1987), is illustrated in the following structures for sentence (1):","(I) (a) The baby fell. (b) ¢ rtl"]},{"title":"r ~I~ ~'~RED ' fall<[baby],' 7 / ~\\ \\ ITENSE past / \\ ~[ [ [NUMB sg II / I /2~ PEC RED th","paragraphs":["The c-structure appears on the left, the f-structure on the right. The c-structure-to-f-structure correspondence, ~b, is shown by the linking lines. The correspondence ¢ is a many-to-one function taking the S, VP and V nodes all into the same outermost unit of the f-stucture, fl.","The node-configuration at the top of the tree satisfies the statement S~NP VP in the context-free description language for the c-structure. As suggested by Kaplan (1987}, this is a simple way of defining a collection of more specific properties of the tree, such as the fact that the S node (labeled nl) is the mother of the NP node (n2). These facts could also be written in equational form as"]},{"title":"M(n2)=nl,","paragraphs":["- 273 - where M denotes the function that takes a tree-node into its mother.

This equation identifies the subject in the f-structure in terms of the mother-daughter relation in the tree.","In LFG the f-structure assigned to a sentence is the smallest one that satisfies the conjunction of equations in its functional description. The functional description is determined from the trees that the c-structure grammar provides for the string by a simple matching process. A given tree is analyzed with respect to the c-structure rules to identify particular nodes of interest. Equations about the f-structure corresponding to those nodes (via ~b) are then derived by substituting those nodes into equation-patterns or schemata. Thus, still following Kaplan (1987), if * appears in a schema to stand for the node matching a given rule-category, the functional description will include an equation containing that node (or an expression such as n2 that designates it) instead of *. The equation (~(M(n2)) SUBJ)----~b(n2) that we inferred above also results from instantiating the schema (di)(M(*)) SUBJ)=¢(*) annotated to the NP element of the S rule in (2a) when that rule-element is matched against the tree in (lb). Kaplan observes that the ? and metavariables in the Kaplan/Bresnan formulation of LFG are simply convenient abbreviations for the complex expressions ~b(M(*)) and ~(*), respectively, thus explicating the traditional, more palatable formulation in (2b).","(2) (a) S--* NP VP ¢(M(*)) SUBJ) = dl)(*) dl)(M(*)) = ~b(*)","(b) S -4 NP VP (1' SUBJ)= t =","This basic conception of descriptions and correspondences has been extended in several ways. First, this framework has been generalized to additional kinds of structures that represent other subsystems of linguistic information (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsen, 1988). These structures can be related by new correspondences that permit appropriate descriptions of more abstract structures to be produced. Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), for example, discuss a level of semantic structure that encodes predicate-argument relations and quantifier scope, information that does not enter into the kinds of syntactic generalizations that the f-structure supports. They point out how the semantic structure can be set in correspondence with both c-structure and f-structure units by means of related mappings o and o'.

In this method the grammar provides general patterns to compare against a given structure and these are then instantiated if the analysis is satisfactory. One consequence of this approach is that the structure in the range of the correspondence, the one whose description is being developed, can only have properties that are derived from information explicitly identified in the domain structure.","Another description mechanism is possible when three or more structures are related through correspondences. Suppose the c-structure and f-structure are related by ¢ as in (2a) and that the function o then maps the f-structure units into corresponding units of semantic structure of the sort suggested by Fenstad et al. (1987). The formal arrangement is shown in Figure 1 (next page). This configuration of cascaded correspondences opens up a new descriptive possibility.

But those properties can obtain only if the intermediate structure is derived from an initial (c-) structure with certain features. For example, Kaplan and Maxwell (1988a) exploit this capability to describe semantic structures for coordinate constructions which necessarily contain the logical conjunction appropriate to the string even though there is no reasonable place for that conjunction to be marked in the f-structure.

Earlier researchers have applied these mechanisms to the linguistic structures for sentences in a single language. In this paper, we extend this system one step further: we introduce correspondences between structures for sentences in different languages that stand in a translation relation to one another. The description of the target language structures are derived via analysis and codescription from the source language structures, by virtue of additional annotations in c-structure rules and lexical entries. Those descriptions are solved to find satisfying solutions, and these solutions are then the input to the target generation process.","In the two language arrangement sketched below, we introduce the ~ correspondence to map between the f-structure units of the source language and the f-structure units of the target language.

The equation ~'o( I' SUBJ)-- o(z t TOPIC) imposes the constraint that the semantics of the source SUBJ will translate via ~' into the semantics of the target TOPIC but gives no further information about what those semantic structures actually contain.","Our general correspondence architecture thus applies naturally to the problem of translation. But there are constraints on correspondences specific to translation that this general architecture does not address. For instance, the description of the target-language structures derived from the source-language is incomplete. The target structures may and usually will have grammatical and semantic features that are not determined by the source. It makes little sense, for example, to include information about grammatical gender in the transfer process if this feature is exhaustively determined by the grammar of the target language. We can formalize the relation between the information contained in the transfer component and an adequate translation of the source sentence into a target sentence as follows: for a target sentence to be an adequate translation of a given source sentence, it must be the case that a minimal structure assigned to that sentence by the target grammar is subsumed by a minimal solution to the transfer description. One desirable consequence of this formalization is that it permits two distinct target strings for a source string whose meaning in the absence of other information is vague but not ambiguous.","Thus this conceptual and notational framework provides a powerful and flexible system for imposing constraints on the form of a target sentence by relating them to information that appears at different levels of source-language abstraction. This apparatus allows us to avoid many of the problems encountered by more derivational, transformational or procedural models of transfer.

Lexical transfer rules such as the one given in (8) independently establish the correspondence - 277 - between source and target within-clause functions.

CONCLUSION We have sketched and illustrated an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between different levels of linguistic representation. This is made possible by the equality and description based mechanisms of LFG. This approach relies mainly on codescription, and thus it is different from other aFG-based approaches that use a - 280-description-by-analysis mechanism to relate the f-structure of a source language to the f-structure of a target language (see for example Kudo and Nomura, 1986). Our proposal allows for partial specifications and multi-level transfer. In that sense it also differs from strategies pursued for example in the Eurotra project (Arnold and des Tombe, 1987), where transfer is based on one level of representation obtained by transforming the surface structure in successive steps.","We see it as one of the main advantages of our approach that it allows us to express correspondences between separate pieces of linguistically motivated representations and in this way allows the translator to exploit the linguistic descriptions of source and target language in a more direct way than is usually proposed.
