GSL is not specifically designed for categorim grammar, but the complexity of the category structures of any non-trivial categorial grammar means that such grammars provide a good testbed for notations for describing categories. Although categorial grammars have recently received considerable attention (Pareschi & Steedman (1987), Klein & van Benthem (1987), Oehrle, Bach & Wheeler (1987)), computational treatments have been hindered by the need to develop and manipulate large category descriptions. The expressive power of GSL is therefore well illustrated by the ease with which we can develop the category descriptions required for a non-trivial categorial grammar. We start with the basic categorial rules: {major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH)","(HEAD=(major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB,","slash/SLASH),","RSLASH=(major/X1, minor/Y1, subcat/SUB1,","slash/SLASH), slash=null!), {major/X1, minor/Y1, subcat/SUB1, slash/SLASH} (major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH) (major/X1, minor/Y1, subcat/SVB1, slash=nullI) (HEAD=(major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB,","slash/SLASH), LSLASH--(major/X1, minor/Y1, subcat/SUB1,","slash/SLASH), slash/SLASH)","The first of these is an extended version of the normal categorial rule for combining something which requires an argument to its right with an argument of the appropriate type, namely: A ~ A/B B","We have been forced to complicate this rule, as have others trying to produce categorial grammars for non-trivial fragments, in order to take into account intrinsic syntactic functions such as case and number agreement, and to deal with the fine details of sub-categorisation rules.

The definition of VERB says that it is something which does not require anything to its left, and that it will participate in local trees dominated by objects of type VP, with the constraint that the VERB has the same minor features as the VP. The definition of VP is fairly similar, but it does make use of the facility for placing names in non-terminal positions to enforce two constraints--one between the entire set of minor features of the VP and the minor features of its head, and another between the agr features of the VP and the agr features of its subject.","Although this set of abbreviations appears only to call upon the facility for including names for non-terminal nodes once, we can see that if we were to expand the macros inside the definition of A UX there would be two other places where this was done (the definition below still has some macros unexpanded to help keep it readable): AUX \"~"]},{"title":"(V, O,","paragraphs":["minor/X=aux=yesT, LSLASH=null!, H=(V, I,","minor/X=vform=agr/AGR,","RSLASH=nuU~, H=(S,minor/X), LSLASH/SUB J=minor=agr/AGR), RSLASH=(VP, LSLASH/SUBJ))","It is worth noting that nowhere in either the expanded definition or in the three abbreviations is the major category of the subject specified.

The rule below generates the %uxinverted\" case frame for A UX's: (V, O, minor=vform/VFORM=agr/AGR, RSLASH=(NP, minor= (SUB J, agr/AGR),","slash=null!), HEAD= (major=cat=partial!, RSLASH/A2, HEAD=(S, minor=(vform/VFORM,","mood =interrogative!))))"]},{"title":"(AUX,","paragraphs":["minor= (vform/VFORM=finite=tensed!), RSLASH/A2)","This rule again specifies names for non-terminal nodes, with VFORM twice being used as a name for a non-terminal node.

It is well-known that disjunctive unification is NPcomplete (Kasper 1987). What is the status of unification of structures with constraints on sub-graphs?","The definition of unification given in Section 2 looks very non-deterministic--full of phrases like ~Suppose V is the value of initial nodes in each of G1 and G2 ~ and ~Suppose V appears as the value of one or more initial nodes in G1 but of none in G2\". We can make it much more constrained by imposing a normal form on graphs. The first thing we need for this is an arbitrary ordering on features, which we can easily find since features are just alphanumeric strings, and these can be ordered lexicographically. If we were working with trees rather than DAGS, and we had such an ordering, we could impose a normal form by ordering the sub-trees of a node by the lexicographic ordering of their own root nodes, so that the normal form of the tree (A (X (Z Y)) (P (S R))) would be: (A (P (R S)) (X (Y Z)))","Unification of trees in this kind of normal form is of complexity o(M × N), where M is the maximum branching factor for the tree and N is the maximum depth. It is clear that we can impose a very similar normal form on DAGs with-out constraints on non-terminal nodes. For DAGs which do have constraints on non-terminal nodes, we have to split the representation of the graph into two pieces. We represent the basic structure of the graph in terms of sets of nodes and their successors; but where a node has a name, we include the name rather than the node itself. For each such named node, we store the sub-graph rooted at the node separately as the value of the name (this sub-graph itself, of course, may contain named nodes, in which case we just do the same again). We now effectively have a set of DAGs each of which has no constraints on internal nodes. We can therefore put each of these into normal form as before. The theoretical time for unification is again o(M × N), though N is now the length of the longest path through the graph you would get if you replaced names by the sub-graphs they name. The practical time is such as to make it perfectly sensible to use it as the basis of a computational system. Quoting times for analysing specific texts is a fairly meaningless way of comparing parsers, let alone unification algorithms, since there are so many unspecified parameters-- size of the grammar, degree of ambiguity in the lexicon, speed of the basic machine, ... All I can say is that left-corner chart parsing with categorial rules specified via GSL descriptions of categories is markedly quicker than naive top-down left-right parsing of grammars of comparable coverage written as DCGs.
