Ramshaw","BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation","10 Moulton Street","Cambridge, MA 02138 USA ABSTRACT","The structure of problem-solving discourse in the expert advising setting can be modeled by adding a layer of metaplans to a plan-based model of the task domain. Classes of metaplans are introduced to model both the agent's gradual refinement and instantiation of a domain plan for a task and the space of possible queries about preconditions or fillers for open variable slots that can be motivated by the exploration of particular classes of domain plans. This metaplan structure can be used to track an agent's problem-solving progress and to predict at each point likely follow-on queries based on related domain plans. The model is implemented in the Pragma system where it is used to suggest corrections for ill-formed input. 1. INTRODUCTION","Significant progress has been achieved recently in natural language (NL) understanding systems through the use of plan recognition and \"plan tracking\" schemes that maintain models of the agent's domain plans and goals. Such systems have been used for recognizing discourse structure, processing anaphora, providing cooperative responses, and interpreting intersentential ellipsis. However, a model of the discourse context must capture more than just the plan structure of the problem domain. Each discourse setting, whether argument, narrative, cooperative planning, or the like, involves a level of organization more abstract than that of domain plans, a level with its own structures and typical strategies. Enriching the domain plan model with a model of the agent's plans and strategies on this more abstract level can add","\"This research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and was monitored by ONR under Contract No. N00014-85-C-0016.

This paper presents an approach to pragmatic modeling in which metaplans are used to model that level of discourse structure for problem-solving discourse of the sort arising in NL interfaces to expert systems or databases.","The discourse setting modeled by metaplans in this work is expert-assisted problem-solving. Note that the agent's current task in this context is creating a plan for achieving the domain goal, rather than executing that plan. In problem-solving discourse, the agent poses queries to the expert to gather information in order to select a plan from among the various possible plans. Meanwhile, in order to respond to the queries cooperatively, the expert must maintain a model of the plan being considered by the agent. Thus the expert is in the position of deducing from the queries that are the agent's observable behavior which possible plans the agent is currently considering. The metaplans presented here model both the agent's plan-building choices refining the plan and instantiating its variables and also the possible queries that the agent may use to gain the information needed to make those choices. This unified model in a single formalism of the connection between the agent's plan-building choices and the queries motivated thereby allows for more precise and efficient prediction from the queries observed of the underlying plan-building choices. The model can be used for plan tracking by searching outward each time from the previous context in a tree of metaplans to explore the space of possible plan-building moves and related queries, looking for a predicted query that matches the agent's next utterance. Thus the examples will be presented in terms of the required search paths from the previous context to find a node that matches the context of the succeeding query.","This metaplan model is discussed in two parts, with Section 2 covering the plan-building class of metaplam, which model the agent's addition of new branches to the domain plan tree and instantiation of variables, while Section 3 presents examples of plan feasibility and slot data query metaplans, which model the agent's strategies for gathering information to use in - 35 - ). plan-building. Section 4 then compares this modeling approach to other plan-based styles of discourse modeling, Section 5 discusses applications for the approach and the current implementation, and Section 6 points out other classes of metaplans that could be used to broaden the coverage of the model and other areas for further work. 2. PLAN BUILDING METAPLANS","In this approach, the plan-building metaplans discussed in this section model those portions of problem-solving behavior that explore the different possible refinements of the plan being considered and the different possible variable instantiations for it. The domain for all the examples in this paper is naval operations, where the agent is assumed to be a naval officer and the expert a cooperative interface to a fleet information system. The examples assume a scenario in which a particular vessel, the Knox, has been damaged in an accident, thereby lower-ing its readiness and that of its group. The top-level goal is thus assumed to be restoring the readiness of that group from its current poor rating to good, expressed as (IncreaseGroupReadiness Knox-group poor good).","The domain plans in Pragma are organized in a classification hierarchy based on their effects and preconditions, so that a node in that hierarchy like the top-level instance of IncreaseGroupReadiness in the examples actually stands for the class of plans that would achieve that result in a certain class of situations. The plan class nodes in this hierarchy can thus be used to represent partially specified plans, the set of plans that an agent might be considering that achieves a particular goal using a particular strategy. The subplans (really plan subclasses) of IncreaseGroupReadiness shown in Figure 1 give an idea of the different strategies that the agent may consider for achieving this goal. (Variables are shown with a prefixed question mark.) (IncreaseGroupReadiness","Knox-group poor good) (1) (RepairShip Knox) (2) (ReinforceGroup Knox-group ?new-ship) (3) (ReplaceShip Knox ?new-ship) (4) Figure 1: Subplans of IncreaseGroupReadiness The plan classification depends on the circumstances, so that RepairShip only functions as a subplan of IncreaseGroupReadiness when its object ship is specified as the Knox, the damaged one, but some of the plans also introduce new variables like ?new-ship, introduced by the ReplaceShip plan, that can take on any value permitted by the plan's preconditions. Each of these plans also has its own subactions describing how it can be achieved, so that ReplaceShip, for example, involves sailing the ?new-ship to the location of the damaged ship, having it take over the duties of the damaged ship, and then sailing or towing the damaged one to a repair facility. Those subactions, in turn, specify goals for which there can be multiple subplans. The metaplan structures modeling the problem-solving discourse are built on top of this tree of domain plans and actions.

QUERY METAPLANS","Although the plan-building metaplans that model the exploration of possible plans and the gradual refinement of an intended plan represent the agent's underlying intent, such moves are seldom observed directly in the expert advising setting. The agent's main observable actions are queries of various sorts, requests for information to guide the plan-building choices. While these queries do not directly add structure to the domain plan being considered, they do provide the expert with indirect evidence as to the plan-building choices the agent is considering. A key advantage of the metaplan approach is the precision with which it models the space of possible queries motivated by a given plan-building context, which in turn makes it easier to predict underlying plan-building structure based on the observed queries.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER PLAN-BASED DISCOURSE MODELS","The use of plans to model the domain task level organization of discourse goes back to Grosz's (1977) use of a hierarchy of focus spaces derived from a task model to understand anaphora. Robinson (1980a, 1980b) subsequently used task model trees of goals and actions to interpret vague verb phrases. Some of the basic heuristics for plan recognition and plan tracking were formalized by Allen and Perrault (1980), who used their plan model of the agent's goals to provide information beyond the direct answer to the agent's query. Carberry (1983, 1984, 1985a, 1985b) has extended that into a plan-tracking model for use in interpreting pragmatic ill-formedness and intersentential ellipsis. The approach presented here builds on those uses of plans for task modeling, but adds a layer modeling problem-solving structure. One result is that the connection between queries and plans that is implemented in those approaches either directly in the system code or in sets of inference rules is implemented here by the query metaplans. Recently, Kautz (1985) has outlined a logical theory for plan tracking that makes use of a classification of plans based on their in-cluded actions. His work suggested the structure of plan classes based on effects and preconditions that is used here to represent the agent's partially specified plan during the problem-solving dialogue. ~ - 39 -","Domain plan models have also been used as elements within more complete discourse models. Carberry's model includes, along with the plan tree, a stack that records the d~_scourse context and that she uses for predicting the discourse goals like"]},{"title":"accept-question","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"expresssurprise","paragraphs":["that are appropriate in a given discourse state. Sidner (1983, 1985) has developed a theory of \"plan parsing\" for distinguishing which of the plans that the speaker has in mind are plans that the speaker also intends the hearer to recognize in order to produce the intended response. Grosz and Sidner (1985) together have recently outlined a three-part model for discourse context; in their terms, plan models capture part of the intentional structure of the discourse. The metaplan model presented here tries to capture more of that intentional structure than strictly domain plan models, rather than to be a complete model of discourse context.","The addition of metaplans to plan-based models owes much to the work of Wilensky (1983), who proposed a model in which metaplans, with other plans as arguments, were used to capture higher levels of organization in behavior like combining two different plans where some steps overlap. Wilensky's metaplans could be nested arbitrarily deeply, providing both a rich and extensive modeling tool. Litman (1985) applied metaplanning to model discourse structures like interruptions and clarification subdialogues using a stack of metaplan contexts. The approach taken here is similar to Litman's in using a metaplan component to enhance a plan-hased discourse model, but the metaplans here are used for a different purpose, to model the particular strategies that shape problem-solving discourse. Instead of a small number of metaplans used to represent changes in focus among domain plans, we have a larger set modeling the problem-solving and query strategies by which the agent builds a domain plan.","Because this model uses its metaplans to capture different aspects of discourse structure than those modeled by Litman's, it also predicts other aspects of agent problem-solving behavior. Because it predicts which queries can be generated by considering particular plans, it can deduce the most closely related domain plan that could motivate a particular query. For instance, when the agent asked about frigates within 500 miles of Knox, the constraint on distance from Knox suggested that the agent was considering the ReplaceShip plan; a similar constraint on distance from port would suggest a RepairShip plan, looking for a ship to transport replacement parts to the damaged one. Another advantage of modeling this level of structure is that the metaplan nodes capture the stack of contexts on which follow-on queries might be based. In this example, follow-on queries might add a new constraint like \"with fuel at 80% of capacity\" as a child of the existing"]},{"title":"add-constraint","paragraphs":["node, add an alternative constraint like \"within 1000 miles of Knox\" as a sibling, query some other predicate within ReplaceShip, or attach even further up the tree.

The clear representation of the problem-solving structure offered in this model also provides the right hooks for attaching heuristic weights to guide the plan tracking system to the most likely plan context match for each new input. Within problem-solving settings, a model that captures this level of discourse structure therefore strengthens an NL system's abilities to track the agent's plans and predict likely queries.","5. APPLICATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION","This improved ability of the metaplan model to track the agent's problem-solving process and predict likely next moves could be applied in many of the same contexts in which domain plan models have been employed, in-cluding anaphora and ellipsis processing and generating cooperative responses. For example, consider the following dialogue where the cruiser Biddle has had an equipment failure:"]},{"title":"Agent:","paragraphs":["Which other cruisers are in the Indian Ocean? (1)"]},{"title":"Expert:","paragraphs":["<Lists 6 cruisers> (2)"]},{"title":"Agent:","paragraphs":["Any within 200 miles of Biddle? (3)"]},{"title":"Expert:","paragraphs":["Home and Belknap. (4)"]},{"title":"Agent:","paragraphs":["Any of them at Diego Garcia? (5)"]},{"title":"Expert:","paragraphs":["Yes, Dale, and there is a supply flight going out to Biddle tonight. (6) The agent first asks about other cruisers that may have the relevant spare parts. The expert can deduce from the query in line (3) that the agent is considering SupplySparePartByShip. The \"them\" in the next query in line (5) could refer either to all six cruisers or to just the two listed in (4). Because the model does not predict the Diego Garcia query as relevant to the current plan context, it is recognized after search in the -40-metaplan tree as due instead to a SupplyPartBy-Plane plan, with the change in plan context implying the correct resolution of the anaphora and also suggesting the addition of the helpful information in (6). The metaplan model of the pragmatic context thus enables the NL processing to be more robust and cooperative.","The Pragma system in which this metaplan model is being developed and tested makes use of the pragmatic model's predictions for suggesting corrections to ill-formed input. Given a suitable library of domain plans and an initial context, Pragma can expand its metaplan tree under heuristic control identifying nodes that match each new query in a coherent problem-solving dialogue and thereby building up a model of the agent's problem-solving behavior. A domain plan library for a subset of naval fleet operations plans and sets of examples in that domain have been built and tested. The result-ing model has been used experimentally for dealing with input that is ill-formed due to a single localized error. Such queries can be represented as underspecified logical forms containing \"wildcard\" terms whose meaning is unknown due to the ill-formedness. By searching the metaplan tree for queries coherently related to the previous context, suggested fillers can be found for the unknown wildcards. For the roughly 20 examples worked with so far, Pragma returns between 1 and 3 suggested corrections for the ill-formed element in each sentence, found by searching for matching queries in its metaplan context model.","6. EXTENSIONS TO THE MODEL AND AREAS FOR FURTHER WORK","This effort to capture further levels of structure in order to better model and predict the agent's behavior needs to be extended both to achieve further coverage of the expert advising domain and to develop models on the same level for other discourse settings. The current model also includes simplifying assumptions about agent knowledge and cooperativity that should be relaxed.","Within the expert advising domain, further classes of metaplans are required to cover in-forming and evaluative behavior. While the expert can usually deduce the agent's plan-building progress from the queries, there are cases where that is not true. For example, an agent who was told that the nearest C1 frigate was the Wilson might respond \"I don't want to use it.\", a problem-solving move whose goal is to help the expert track the agent's planning correctly, predicting queries about other ships rather than further exploration of that branch. Inform-ing metaplans would model such actions whose purpose is to inform the expert about the agent's goals or constraints in order to facilitate the expert's plan tracking. Evaluative metaplans would capture queries whose purpose was not just establishing plan feasibility but comparing the cost of different feasible plans. Such queries can involve factors like fuel consumption rates that are not strictly plan preconditions. The typical patterns of movement in the metaplan tree are also different for evaluation, where the agent may compare two differently-instantiated"]},{"title":"build-plan","paragraphs":["nodes point for point, moving back and forth repeatedly, rather than following the typical feasibility pattern of depth-first exploration. Such a comparison pattern is highly structured, even though it would appear to the current model as patternless alternation between"]},{"title":"ask-pred-value","paragraphs":["queries on two different plan branches. Metaplans that capture that layer of problem-solving strategy would thus significantly extend the power of the model.","Another important extension would be to work out the metaplan structure of other discourse settings. For an example closely related to expert advising, consider two people trying to work out a plan for a common goal; each one makes points in their discussion based on features of the possible plan classes, and the relationship between their statements and the plans and the strategy of their movements in the plan tree could be formalized in a similar system of metaplans.","The current model also depends on a number of simplifying assumptions about the cooperativeness and knowledge of the agent and expert that should be relaxed to increase its generality. For example, the model assumes that both the expert and the agent have complete and accurate knowledge of the plans and their preconditions. As Pollack (1986) has shown, the agent's plan knowledge should instead be for-mulated in terms of the individual beliefs that define what it means to have a plan, so the model can handle cases where the agent's plans are incomplete or incorrect. Such a model of the agent's beliefs could also be a major factor in the heuristics of plan tracking, identifying, for example, predicates whose value the agent does not already know which therefore are more likely to be queried. The current model should also be extended to handle multiple goals on the agent's part, examples where the expert does not know in advance the agent's top-level goal, and cases of interactions between plans. -41 -","However, no matter how powerful the pragmatic modeling approach becomes, there is a practical limitation in the problem-solving setting on the amount of data available to the expert in the agent's queries. More powerful, higher level models require that the expert have appropriately more data about the agent's goals and problem-solving state. That tradeoff explains why an advisor who is also a friend can often be much more helpful than an anonymous expert whose domain knowledge may be similar but whose knowledge of the agent's goals and state is weaker. The goal for cooperative interfaces must be a flexible level of pragmatic modeling that can take full advantage of all the available knowledge about the agent and the recognizable elements of discourse structure while still avoiding having to create high-level structures for which the data is not available.
