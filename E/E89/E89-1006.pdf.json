It is based on the theory of tenses of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer.","Instead of using operators to express the meaning of the tenses the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the tenses with respect to the meaning of the text is understood as contribution to the integration of the events of a sentence in the event structure of the preceeding text. Thereby a system of relevant times provided by the preceeding text and by the temporal adverbials of the sentence being processed is used. This system consists of one or more reference times and ~emporal perspective ~imes, the speech time and the location time. The special in-terest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of \"anchors\" for the new event out of the system of relevant times and to update this system of temporal coordinates correctly. The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature. In op-position to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact meaning of the tenses is fixed by the resolution component and not in the process of syntactic analysis."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["On a Reichenbachian analysis tenses are interpreted as relating three kinds of temporal entities: the time Of the event talked about, the speech time (time of utterance) and the refer-","*The research was done in the context of ACORD (ES-PRIT P393) and LILOG, and was also supported by the German Science Foundation (Ro245/13-3) ence time. In the original version these entities are understood as time-points. In the sequel frequently this system was transformed into interval-based approaches to describe the interaction of adverbials, tenses and aspect on sentence level (cf. v.Eynde(1987), Bras/Sorillo(1988)) or to describe the course of events on text level (cf. Hinrichs(1986), Partee(1984)l). A detailed criticism of the Reichenbachian analysis of tenses can be found in B~uerle(1979)). Motivated by text-phenomena the Kamp/Rohrer approach (1983,1985) splits the Reichenbachian reference time into three contextually given parameters by adding temporal perspective points and location times.","Our approach which is based on the Kamp/Rohrer analysis differs from treatments of the semantics of tenses (and aspects) which characterize the tenses by some simple operator (usually interpreted as a temporal quantifier) in that respect that the tenses are described in terms of their contribution to the problem of how the temporal structure of the events talked about can be constructed. The problem how to determine the times the context has to supply and to which the events have to be related is largely neglected in theoretical discussions of the semantics of tenses. It is the main topic of our discussion. Special attention has been paid to the interaction of tense, aspect and temporal adverbials in determining these relations. The approach represents a unified account of tense and aspects. Another problem dealt with is the problem of tense switch.","We will restrict the discussion to French tenses prevailing in (written) reports about past events (imparfait, pass~ simple, passd composd, plusqueparfait, conditionnel). The tense system","x Partee has discussed at length the parallelism between nominal and temporal anaphora. The idea of tenses as anaphora, as developed there, underlies to a certain extent our approach as well. - 43 - concerning the past, in contrast to that relating to the present or future time, is rather elaborated, especially in French. A proper theory of tenses has to account for this multiplicity."]},{"title":"2 Representing events in DKT","paragraphs":["In the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp(1981)) a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) is a pair < U, K > consisting of a set U of discourse referents (DRFs) and a set K of conditions. Discourse Referents are assumed to be sorted according to the following sort system (for our purposes only the temporal branch is relevant): all, a temporal, t non-temporal, x dynamic state, s event, e process, p","We shall use the indicated letters for DRFs of the corresponding sort 2. Conditions take the following forms: . . 3. P(al,..., an), where P is an n-ary predicate symbol and the ai are discourse referents. Conditions of this form are also called atomic. For 2-place temporal relations we will also use infix notation. DRS1 ==~ DRS2 t: DRS, where t is a temporal DRF Thus DRT uses a variant of the Davidsonian method of talking about events: they are treated as a kind of objects. But DRT deviates from the Davidsonian representation in that instead of using additional argument places in the predicates","2For simplicity we will use the term event not just for the corresponding subsort of dynamic but also for dynamic or temporal objects in general. For the same reasaa we do not make a clear distinction between \"aspect\" and \"Aktionsarten\". The intended meaning should be clear from the context. The classification is related to the one given in VendieT(1967). an event discourse referent is put before a DttS representing the nature of the event. This allows for a recursive definition of aspects and to account for aspectual change. So the process p of z's travelling would be written in DRT as and the event of x's travelling to Paris would be written as p x paris","e': p: I travel(x) 1 goal(p, paris) DRSs containing conditions as these are embedded into models by mapping the temporal DRFs onto objects in a domain of temporal objects. A proper embedding is realized if the value of the event-DRF fulfills conditions represented by the sub-DRS which the event introduces with respect to an in-terpretation function defined among other things on predicates such as travel in the example above.","An advantage of this representation on the one hand is that, following the usual definition of accessibility of DRSs from a DRS used in DRT, restrictions on the accessibility of DRFs as possible an-tecedents for anaphoras can be expressed, though for our purposes this will play only a subordinate role. On the other hand different modes of existence can be discriminated for the objects DRFs stand for, depending on the position of the sub-DRSs, where these DRFs are introduced, in the DRS of the whole text. In the case of reported speech for instance, the real existence of a reported episode is not necessary. Extensions of the original modeltheory ofDRT (cf. Kamp(1981)) which point in this direction are given e.g. in (Asher(19S6), Reyle(1985), Eberle(1988b))."]},{"title":"3 Basic Assumptions of the Semantics of Tenses and Adverbials","paragraphs":["The basic tenses of French narrative texts are imparfait and pass~ simple.

The f-structure serves as input for the construction of a proto-semantic representation (cf. Reyle(1985), Reinhardt/Kasper(1987)). The last stage consists in integrating this representation into a semantic representation for the discourse, mainly by doing the necessary resolutions for anaphoric expressions. Accordingly, the system consists of three major modules: LFG-Parser: I f-structure Composer: I Proto-DRS DRS ~ Knowledge base","The whole system is implemented in PRO-LOG.

Thereby, this information is passed to the Resolver which separates semantic and syntactic information and uses it. What sort of morpho-syntactic information is passed will be discussed later.","The concept of resolution here is broader than the usual one which comprises mainly determining the reference of anaphoric expressions like pronouns.

Plusqueparfait for instance has a reading as flashback, and a perfective state reading with the temporal perspective \"speech-time\" or actually reached \"reference time\". Imparfait can have the perspective in the past at the reference time or at the speech time. Following Kamp/Rohrer(1985), the meanings of the main narrative tenses can be described in the following way: Form TP passe s. imparfait imparfait plusquep. plusquep. plusquep. cond. I -PAST -PAST +PAST +PAST -PAST +PAST +PAST TENSE [ PROG [PERF past past + - pres + - past past + + pres + + fut +/- -","Since it is not desirable to represent these ambiguities syntactically we use the Kamp/Rohrer categories in a slightly different way to get unique descriptions of the tenses.

If the temporal perspective point is changed (plusqueparfalt and conditionnel), a substack is created and used till the original perspective point is restored.","The resolver removes the occurrence information for the tenses and temporal adjuncts from the proto-DRS. The tenses get resolved according to the rules discussed below. The presence of temporal adjuncts changes the flow of resolution as it requires that the temporal DRF introduced by the adjunct has to be resolved in accordance with the DRF introduced by the tense.","We will illustrate the effect of some resolution rules reflecting the heuristics of the system by discussing two sample texts. sl Ce jour-l~ il pleuvait tr~s fort. e2 Jean regarda par la fen~tre. s3 Marie n'~tait pas 1£. e4 Il mit son impermSable e5 et sortit. ce jour-ld introduces the location time t for the first state, sl, (pleuvoir). The Composer augments the DRS by the condition day(t) and the Resolver by the condition t C sl. 5 The first times-quintuple consists of a variable for the reference time, (no event is actually mentioned), the perspective point is assumed to be the speech time. The speech time is fixed by \"now\", t is the location time and in the last position the occ-term of sl is stored. Since a reference time does not yet exist, the integration of e2 produces a temporal relation with respect to the last location time: e2 C t, i.e. e2 happens within t. A second times-quintuple is put onto the stack with the reference time e2 and the new occ-term. The other time coordinates remain constant.","SBecause of the definite description ce jour-ld the NP-Resolver has to establish an equation between t and a DRF of the preceeding text which is a day. If there is no such antecedent t has to be accomodated. The latter ease is at present not implemented. e2 serves now as reference time for s3. The new relation e2 C s3 is introduced and the information which stems from the occ-term of s3 and the old tenses is put as a third times quintuple onto the stack. The reference time is not changed. It should be noticed that for new states the \"smallest\" available location time is used. Normally this is the reference time of the previous quintuple if existent. For it is not necessary that the explicit given location time, ce jour-lh in the given example, serves as location time for subsequently introduced states as well. e4 is ordered with respect to e2, e5 with respect to e4 by the not-before-relation and the times-stack is updated in the obvious way. All states and events are located obviously before the speech time now. We omit tile full DRS of the example here. el Le 6 octobre Pierre arriva ~ Paris. e2 Le 3 octobre il ~tait parti. e3 Le lendemain il avait travers~ l'Espagne. sl Et maintenant il ~tait l'a. According to the different meanings of the plusqueparfait mentioned in section 3 different rules are available to deal with the plusqueparfait of the second sentence. However, especially in cases where a frame time as in the example exists, the possibility to introduce a flashback is preferred. A stack in the stack is created and the new event serves as reference time for subsequent events in the flashback. The last reference time of the higher level is now regarded as temporal perspective for the events occcuring in the flashback. They are localized before that perspective, le lendemain in the third sentence has to be resolved to an existing reference time, i.e. el or e2. Since we are already in a flashback, in processing the plusqueparfait of e3 the continuation of this flashback is preferred. Thus a solution with el as antecedent for le lendernain would lead to a cyclic structure and should be ruled out by the inference component. The correct ordering conditions are given by establishing e2 as antecedent for the time introduced by le iendemain, and t as location time for e3. The perspective time is copied from the stack. Thus we get the conditions: e2 < t, e3 C t,e3 < el The embedded stack is updated by the new quintuple. The implemented heuristics require that the tense switch from a plusqueparfait of a flashback to pass~ - 48 - simple or pass~ compos~ or the explicit reference to the perspective point, for instance by means of \"maintenant\", always lead to a reactivation of the initial level, from which the first flashback started, that is, all substacks are popped. Without maintenant the imparfait of sl could lead to the continuation of the flashback or to the continuation of the main story. It is regarded as the state variant of both categories.","The (simpified) DRS of the example above thus looks as follows: now tl t2 t3 el e2 e3 sl 6 octobre(tl) el: [arriver(pierre)[ goal(el) = paris el c tl el < now 3 octobre(t2) e2: I partir(pierre) I e2 C t2 e2 < now e2 < el day(t3) e3: traverser(pierre,espagne) I e3 C t3 e3 < now e3 < el next-day(t3,t2) s3: [ ~tre-~(pierre,paris) ] el C sl sl < now","In our opinion cases as in the example above cannot be treated without adding new parameters to the Reichenbachian system. At least doing it facilitates the job. Beyond the imparfait/pass~ simple, pass~ compos~-distinction French does not make use of an explicit morphological aspect mark-ing. Therefore, for instance in the case of conditionnel, treated as anticipation of an episode, we use the Aktionsart-characterization of the verb stored in the temporal sort of the DI~F to specify the value of the prog-feature. An episode of states and dynamics then is treated similar to an imparfait-pass~ simple-story transposed by the stored (past) perspective time. By this means we get an interaction of Aktionsarten and tenses.","Similar to the case of flashback the tense switch from conditionnel to another past tense form marks the end of the anticipation and the reactivation of the initial level. 5 Conclusion and Problems The implemented system assigns DRSs to natural language texts in such a way that the partial event structure, substructure of the whole DRS, reflects the events and temporal relations of the story. The system is incomplete at present in the following respects: The interaction of nominals and aspects is not accounted for. A principled treatment of tenses in embedded clauses is missing. The resolution of deictic/anaphoric temporal adjuncts is rudimentary. Knowledge about event types is at present not available to the Resolver. Thus the output event structure is generally underspecified. The integration of an inference component combined with background knowledge should restrict the number of possibilities to order the events linearly. In dependance of the Aktionsart the events of the DRS can be assigned subevents mark-ing the boundaries of the event as suggested by Moens and Steedman(1986), (cf. Eberle(1988b)). These subevents can be regarded as having no temporal extension. Thus on the subevent-level before and equivalent exhaust the intuitive possibilities of temporal relations. By means of this finer granulation the (linear) event substructure of a DB.S corresponds to a unique (linear) interval structure provided the event relations before and overlap are defined in terms of Allen's interval structures (cf. Allen(1983)). Thus inferencing systems which deal with intervals, as the Allen system, be-come available but also systems which deal with point-like events as the event calculus of Kowalski/Sergot(1985). In addition we get the possibility to deal with temporal relations on different levels of precision.","In Eberle(1988a) the possibilities of monotonic reasoning in partial event structures (in the sense of the Kowalski/Sergot-approach) were investigated. It is planned to extend the algorithm suggested there which adds deduced events to the structure, in order to deal with measure statements, knowledge about hierarchies of event types (e.g. subevent - 49 - typologies) and temporal frames for event types"]},{"title":"(average","paragraphs":["duration of an"]},{"title":"event","paragraphs":["type). One aim is to rule out circular structures as mentioned in section 4.4. For simple cases we are able to do it yet. In such conflicting cases one has to backtrack to the Resolver, the Composer or the Parser to generate other readings. In this sense the suggested analysis system is non-monotonic since it generates other temporal relations if necessary. When finally a consistent reading has been arrived at, the event calculus can be used for non-monotonic reasoning, e.g.to deal with the problem of the validity of location times with respect to events localized before or after events for which an explicit relation of in-clusion holds."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Allen, J.(1983): Maintaining Knowledge about Temporal Intervala In: Comm.ACM 26, 1983, pp.832-843","[2] Asher,N.(1986): Belie] in Discourse Representation Theor~ In: Journal of Philosophical Logic 15 (1986) pp.127-189","[3] B~uerle, R.(1979): Temporale Deixis, temporale Frage: zum pvopositionalen Gehalt deldarativer und interrogativer S~'tze Ergebnisse und Methoden moderner Sprachwissenschaft, Band 5, Tfibingen, Narr","[4] Borillo, A., Borillo, M., Bras, M.(1988): Une Approche Cognitive du Raisonnement Temporei, rapports LSI No.286, Toulouse","[5] Kaplan, R.,Bresnan, J.
