First, verbal valencies are contained in a set rather than in a list. Second, type-raised NP's are described as two-sided functors. The new framework does not overgenerate i.e., it accepts all and only the sentences which are grammatical. This follows partly from the elimination of false lexical ambiguities - i.e., ambiguities introduced in order to account for all the possible positions a word can be in within a sentence - and partly from a system of features constraining the possible combinations."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["In the version of categorial grammar (henceforth, CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), categories encode both constituency and linear precedence. Linear precedence is encoded by (a) ordering valencies in a list and (b) using directional slashes indicating whether the argument is to be found to the left or to the right of the functor.","A similar approach is adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987) as regards word order whereby the directional slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value pre orpost. Thus, S/NPLNP in normal CG lranslates as S/NP:predNP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that the functor must precede the argument and post that it should follow it.","Our work on French syntax supports the claim that the complicated pattern of French linearity phenomena can be treated in a framework closely related to UCG but which departs from it in two ways. First, there is no rigid assignment of an order value (pre orpost) to verb valencies. Second, following (Gunji 1986) verbal valencies are viewed as forming a set rather than a list. As * The word reported here was tan'led out as part of ESPRIT Project 393 ACORD,'q'he Construction and Interrogation of Knowledge Bases using Natural Language Text and Grapities\". a result, the syntactic behaviour of constituents is dissociated from surface ordering.

UCG","paragraphs":["In UCG, the phonological, categorial, semantic and order information associated with a word is contained in a single grammar structure called a sign. This can be represented as follows.","(1) UCG sign Phonology:Categnry:Semantics:Order","or equivalently Phonology :Category :Semantics :Order","where colons separate the different fields of the sign.","We need not concern ourselves here with the Semantics and the Phonology fields of the sign. More interesting for our purpose are the Category and the Order attributes. Following the categorial tradition, categories can be basic or complex. Basic categories are of the form HeadAFeatures where Head is one of the atomic symbols n(oun), np or s(entence) and Features is a list of feature values. Complex categories are of the form C/Sign, where C is either atomic or complex and Sign is a sign, so that departing from traditionalCG's,a functorplaces constraints on the whole sign of the argument rather than on its syntactic category only. The part of a complex category which omits the Head'Weatures information constitutes the activepart of the sign. The f'trst accessible sign in the active part is called the active sign, the idea being that e.g. verb valencies are ordered in a list so that each time a valency is consumed, the next sign in the active part becomes the new active sign. The Order attribute places constraints on the combination rule that may apply to a functor: pre on an argument sign Y indicates that the functor X/Y must precede the argument, while post indicates that the functor must follow the argument. - 249-Using terms and term unification, the forward version 1 of functional application can then be stated as follows.

On the other hand, word order in French is not free either.

The notion of combination relies on the idea that the active part of a verb is a set rather than a list. More precisely, given a type-raised NP NP1 with category C/(C/NP.) where NP i is a valency sign, and a verb V1 with category slActSet where ActSet is a set of valency signs, NP1 combines with V1 to yield V2 iff NPi unifies with some NP-valency sign in the active set ActSet of the verb. V2 is identical to V1 except that the unifying NP i valency sign has been removed from the active set and that some features in V1 will have been instantiated by the rule. Forward combination further requires (ii) that the two features in the condition list to pre unify with the Lastlefl and Vmood features of the argument (the features conditioning post are ignored since they are relevant only when the functor combines backwards), and (iii) that the features of the resulting sign be as specified. Note in particular that the MClass of the resulting sign is the MClass of the argument, that Lastright which indicates the morphological class ofthelast sign to have combined with the verb from theright, is transmitted from the argument, and thatLastlefl is assigned as value the MClass of the functor.

For example, wh-constituents reject through their conditions topre a wh-value for the Lastlefl feature of the argument and an inv16 value in their condition to post.

This allows us to express constraints on the position of a given type of NP (lex, wh or clitic) relative to the valency it consumes. For instance,a lexical NPcan be subject or object. If it is subject and it is to the left of the verb, it cannot be immediately followed by a wh-constituent. If it is subject and it is placed to the right of the verb, it must be immediately adjacent to it. These constraints can be stated using unification along to the following lines. A verb valency is of the form (17) (np:[... X,Y ...]:Ord) where X and Y are either the anonymous variable or a constant.

COVERAGE AND DISCUSSION","paragraphs":["The current grammar accounts for the core local linearity phenomena of French i.e., auxiliary and clitic order, clitic placement in simple and in complex verb phrases, clitic doubling and interrogative inversions. Unbounded dependencies are catered for without resorting either to threading COCG), functional uncertainty (Karttunen) or functional composition (Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Steedman 1986). Instead, the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducing an embedding valency on matrix verbs. Finally, non local order constraints such as constraints on the distribution of negative particles and the requirement for a wh-constituent to be placed to the left of the verb when a lexical subject is placed to the right (see example (22d)) can also be handled.","Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structure and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together in a lexical framework. Following GPSG, our formalism does not associate verb valencies with any intrinsic order. An interesting difference however is that LP statements are not used either. This is important since in French, clitic ordering (B~s 1988) shows that order constraints may hold between items belonging to different local trees. Another difference with GPSG is that as in UCG, no explicit statement of feature instantiation principles is required: the feature flow of information is ensured by the concatenation rules. Last but not least, it is worth underlining that our approach (1) keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 (plus a unary deletion rule) and (2) eliminates unjustified lexical ambiguity i.e., ambiguity not related to categorial or semantic information on the other hand.","Though there are - or so we argue - good linguistic reasons for representing verb valencies as a set rather than as a list, it is only fair to stress that this rapidly leads to computational innefficiency while parsing. Typically, given 3 adjacent signs NP 1 V NP2 there will be two ways of combining each NP with the verb and thus two parses. In a more complex sentence, so-called \"spurious ambiguities\" - i.e., analyses which yield exactly the same sign - multiply very quickly. We are currently working on the problem."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["B ar-Hillel, Yehoshna (1953) A quasi-arithmetical no-tation for syntactic description.
