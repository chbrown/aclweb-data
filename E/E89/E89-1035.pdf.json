The motivation for this research is twofold. Firstly, we wish to use this substantial data-base of naturally occurring constructions to test the accuracy mad adequacy of a (purportedly) wide-coverage sentence grammar (Grover et al., 1987, 1989) which has been developed over the past three years as part of a general-purpose morphological and syntactic analyser for English (hereafter the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) grammar). 2 The research reported here forms part of an ongoing project to evaluate the complete grammar using data extracted from the LOB corpus (see Briscoe et al., 1987a). Secondly, Sampson (1987a) has analysed a large subset of the same NPs and argued that they provide evidence against any clear-cut distinction between grammatical and 'deviant' sentences in natural language. Sampson suggests that the lack of such a distinction precludes the possibility of successful automated natural language processing (NLP) using a generative grammar. If correct, this conclusion would have profound implications for our own work and the majority of other work in NLP (since the ANLT grammar is a type of generative grammar). Therefore, we wished to assess the evidence which Sampson uses to sutrtx~ his conclusion.","The LOB treebank is a manually analysed set of sentences drawn from the lexically analysed and tagged LOB corpus. ~ An analysis consists of a labelled bracketing containing lexical syntactic tags and phrasal or clausal 'hypertags'. Sampson (1987,'221) reports that there are 47 tags and hypertags relevant to the analysis of NPs -","28 lexical tags, 14 hypertags and 5 punctuation tags~ Analyses are assigned to sentences according to the intuitions of the linguist guided by a 'casebook' of precedents (Sampson, 1987b). One important feature of these analyses is that the resulting tree structures are quite 'shallow' in the sense that there are rarely intervening nodes between the topmost node marked NP and the lexical tags themselves. Whilst most NP postmodifiers are treated as independent constituents, NP premodifiers are largely analysed as immediate daughters of the topmost NP node. In addition, punctuation tags are usually attached as immediate daughters of this node. A second significant feature of the LOB treebank analysis scheme is that tags and hypertags are atomic symbols (albeit with mnemonic names designed to indicate aspects of their featural composition).","Sampson (1987a:221) treats these 47 tags and hypertags as defining the types of distinct NP: \"two or more noun phrases are regarded as tokens of the same type if their respective immediate constituents (ICs) represent the same sequence of possibilities drawn from this 47-member set of constituent-types\". The example he gives of an NP type is DT* *S , F which would be the analysis assigned to an NP consisting of a determiner, plural noun, comma and finite clause. In this example, Sampson has generalised across sets of atomic tags through the use of 'wildcard' symbols, so DT* generalises across DTI, DT$, DTS, DTX, and so forth. He does not explain the extent to which he has generalised types in this fashion; however, since (hyper)tags contain at most four letters representing distinct features there are strict limits on featural decomposition within this framework of analysis. Sampson found that the 8328 NP tokens in his sample fell into 747 distinct NP types (relative to the notion of type just described). However, the crucial point of his argument is that the distribution of tokens amongst types is very wide. Sampson finds that there are a few very common types (such as 1135 tokens of DT* N* ie. determiner followed by noun) and a large number of distinct types with very few tokens (such as 468 types represented by a single token). Sampson examines the shape of the constituent type/token curve which results from analysing each type frequency relative to the most frequent type in the corpus. Sampson (1987a:225) concludes that this analysis provides \"no evidence at all of a two-way partition of noun phrase types into a group of high-frequency, well-formed constructions and a group of unique or rare 'deviant' constructions; instead noun phrase types in the sample appear to be scattered continuously across the frequency spectrum.\" Furthermore, he suggests that the evidence from NPs supports his claim that \"the range of constructions occurring in authentic texts seems so endlessly diverse"]},{"title":"- 256 -","paragraphs":["that the enterprise of formulating watertight generative grammars appears doomed to failure\" (1987b:219).","The last step in Sampson's argument from the distribution of tokens amongst NP types to the failure of the generative paradigm is not made completely explicit. However, we believe that a legitimate way of reconstructing it is as follows. Suppose that we convert each NP type as defined above into a phrase-structure rule of a generative grammar (so DT* *S , F becomes NP -> DT* *S, F and so forth). Now consider the form that such a grammar will take: there will be a small number of quite general rules which will be used frequently and a very large number of particular rules used very infrequently. Crucially, for any corpus considered, many of the particular rules will be motivated by just one token in the data. Thus, these rules are not rules in any genuine sense since they express no generalisations over the data. Furthermore, this suggests that the task of the generative linguist (in search of watertight grammars) will never be complete because each new set of data will bring with it the need for further highly idiosyncratic 'rules' of this kind.","Whilst it seems likely that \"all grammars leak\" slightly, one clear problem with Sampson's argument is that his evidence only bears on one particular and implausible generative grammar, rather than on the paradigm as a whole. It may well be that the generalisations which can be expressed in terms of a phrase-structure grammar employing a finite set of (nearly) atomic categories are not those appropriate to elegant description of natural language syntax (Chomsky, 1957; Gazdar et al., 1985). In addition, the strategy of adopting 'shallow' analyses in which each phrase-structure rule will have many daughter categories will tend to reduce the applicability of each rule. In these respects, the ANLT grammar is a more conventional generative grammar, based on recent monostratal approaches to syntactic description. Syntactic categories are feature complexes and unification is employed as the method of grammatical combination. Syntactic generalisations are expressed in terms of partially specified immediate dominance rules, linear precedence rules and a variety of metagrammatical statements concerning feature defaults, propagation, optional pre/postmodification, and so forth. 4 In addition, the particular analysis of NPs adopted recognises a number of intermediate nominal categories (such as N-bar), as well as recursion within these categories, and this ensures that most individual rules mention fewer daughters than would be typical in the analysis used in the description of the LOB treebank. For these reasons, we felt that a fairer test of Sampson's claims would be to evaluate the same corpus of NPs with respect to the ANLT grammar. In addition, this exeereise would provide valuable information concerning the real adequacy of the account of English NPs incorporated into this grammar. THE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE","A superset of the corpus of data analysed by Sampson (1987a) was extracted from the LOB treebank using tree searching software developed by the first author and Roger Garside of Lancaster University's computing department. Following Sampson, we ignored categories G (Belles lettres, biography, essays) and P (Romance and love story) from the treebank data-base. The omission of this treebank data merely reflects the state of development of the treebank at the time when Sampson undertook his experiment. However, Sampson also ignored coordination because he felt that coordination reduction and such phenomena would create \"special complications\". We include results for the coordinated examples because the ANLT grammar contains the required rules. In other respects, the initial samples are identical; both being drawn from an identical 38,212 word sample from the treebank.","Of the 10,150 NPs in this sample of the treebank, 17 were rejected because they were incorrectly analysed and either were not, in fact, NPs or else the boundaries of the putative NP were incorrectly marked and, therefore, our access software failed. The remaining 10,133 NPs were initially sorted into single and multi constituent NPs (according to the LOB model of analysis). Single constituent NPs were further sorted according to the incidence and order of their immediate lexical constituents and multi constituent NPs according to the incidence, order and attachment of their immediate daughters. At this point, we discarded a further 119 NPs which were tagged in a way which indicated they contained either foreign phrases (for example, fait accomplO or mathematical formulae and symbols. These are tagged but not analysed internally in the treebank. We assume that they are irrelevant to the syntax of English NPs. These steps resulted in 10,014 NPs being sorted into 2358 distinct NP types. These types must be identical with Sampson's initial analysis (modulo the inclusion of coordination and exclusion of formulae and foreign phrases) because they are based entirely on the literal form of the tags in the LOB treebank.","The next stage of our analysis was to semi-automatically reduce these 2358 NP types into fewer types by collapsing together tags on the basis of grammatical generalisations exploited in the ANLT grammar rules and implicit in the LOB tag names. For example, there is no purpose in treating NPs identical apart from the number of the head noun as distinct (although they are tagged distinctly) because the ANLT grammar will deploy precisely the same set of rules to analyse them. Sampson (1987a) also collapsed types by generalising across tags, however, he gives no details of this procedure, so it is impossible to quantify the extent to which our analyses diverged at this point. Following Sampson, we ignored the internal structure of postmodifiers (such as PPs, relative clauses, etc.) and of possessive premodifiers. However, in order not to trivialise the experiment we analysed the same set of lexical data covered by his analysis regardless of whether lexical items are treated as immediate constituents of NP in the ANLT grammar. For example, - 257 - sequences of simple adjectival or possessive premodifiers are directly attached to the topmost NP node in the treebank, so we consider these cases in our results.","We also performed some manual editing of the LOB examples to remove punctuation. The ANLT grammar contains no rules referring to punctuation since we do not regard punctuation as a syntactic phenomenon. However, where punctuation reflects a genuine syntactic distinction (such as that between restrictive and nonrestrictive postmodification), examples were classified appropriately. This approach probably gives us a slight edge over Sampson in terms of the generalising power of our rules, but we do not regard this as pernicious because we do not recognise a syntactic difference between examples such as the man with red shoes in the park and the man with red shoes, in the park, gjven the semantically intuitive analysis. 48 NPs contained brackets, of which 34 signalled appositional or parenthetical material. The appositional cases were parsed with brackets deleted. The parenthetical cases were counted as failures (see below for further discussion). In 8 of the remaining cases, the brackets were internal to an embedded constituent and were, therefore, irrelevant. 3 further examples contained point numbering or marking (i.e. a)... b)...) conventions and the final 3 enclosed ordinary modifiers. These 6 examples were parsed with brackets and numbering/marking conventions removed.","These steps resulted in 707 distinct NP types. Sampson (1987a) found 747 types. When one considers that punctuation will have increased the number of types he found, it seems likely that we have probably reanalysed the data in a manner quite similar to his original analysis. One token of each of the 707 revised types of NP was parsed using the ANLT grammar NP rules. Initially, we attempted to perform this analysis automatically using the ANLT project parser in batch mode. The words in the example to be parsed were replaced with their lexical tags and a 'lexicon' was created relating tags to lexical syntactic categories in the ANLT grammar. Data from the treebank and other data from two different corpora were parsed in this fashion and the output was manually analysed to select the semantically correct analysis, weed out 'false positives' where the system had assigned one or more incorrect analyses, and to diagnose the reasons for parse failure.","Failures occurred beth because of inadequacies in grammatical coverage and because of resource limitations with some long and multiply-ambiguous NPs. The resulting data contained many cases of multiple analyses of the type expected using a grammar containing rules to handle PP attachment and compounding (see, for example, Church & Patil, 1982). The intention was to compute the frequency with which each rule of the grammar applied and the overall success rate of the grammar/parser from these manually edited files. However, the process of evaluating and searching for correct analyses amongst very high numbers of automatically generated parses required more effort than manually applying the rules to check that the semantically correct analysis could be produced. This problem highlights the need for automatic semantic 'filtering' of the parses produced, but, in the absence of a fairly comprehensive and sophisticated lexical and compositional semantic component, this was not possible.","Therefore, we completed the analysis of one token of each of the 707 NP types by manually applying the ANLT grammar to check that the semantically • appropriate analysis could be produced. When the correct parse was available, the rules used in this analysis were recorded. We derived a numerical index of the generality of each rule by counting each application and multiplying it by the number of tokens in each type exemplified by the parsed example. RESULTS","622 of the 707 examples were parsed successfully, yielding a success rate of 87.97% When the success rate takes account of the frequency of each NP type in the sample and indicates the proportion of successful NP parses which would be achieved by the ANLT system for this data, the figure rises to 96.88% or 9702 NPs parsed successfully out of the 10,014 sample.","The analyses utilised a total of 54 distinct rules expressed in the ANLT 'object grammar' formalism. Of these 8 were additions prompted by the experiment: 3 for names (Mr. Joe Bloggs), I for noun compounding (water meter), 2 for adverbial pre- and post-modification (nearly a century), 1 for possessive NPs dominated by N-bar (the America's cup), and 1 for NPs with adjectival heads (the poor). We added these rules because they express uncontroversial generalisations and represent 'oversights' in the development of the grammar rather than ad hoc additions solely for the purposes of the experiment.","These object grammar rules were produced by 7 linear precedence statements, 4 rules of feature propagation, 6 feature default rules, 3 metarules, and 50 immediate dominance rules in the metagrammar. Although the metagrammar is the 'seat of linguistic generalisations' in our system, parsing proceeds in terms of a compiled object grammar derived from these metagrammatical statements. Therefore, statistics concerning rule application will be associated with the object grammar.","We counted the number of times each of the 54 object grammar phrase-structure rules would apply in the analysis of all the parsable examples in the sample. The categories of these object grammar rules still contain features with varlable-values which will be instsntiated at parse time by unification. They are therefore considerably more general than similar rules with atomic or nearly-atomic categories (of the kind which are implicit in the treebank analyses and resulting NP types). Table 1 below presents these results. The rules used end their corresponding names are a superset of those described in Grover et al. (1987). Grover et al.

For example, some low numbers are an artifact of the preliminary analysis into types. Thus, N2+/PRO(FOOT9), which would be utilised to parse NPs consisting of wh-pronouns, such as who,"]},{"title":"what,","paragraphs":["and so forth, only applies once. In the preliminary analysis, we decided to collapse together tags for the wh and non-wh version of the same category. It is just an accident that in all of the representative tokens of each type which were parsed, only one wh-pronoun turned up and this happened to represent a singleton type. Similarly, N1/SFIN only applies twice, but it is probable that there are more examples of nouns taking sentential complements as arguments in the sample. The LOB tagset represents these complements by 'Fn' and relative clauses by 'Fr'. Following Sampson, we collapsed all of these to 'F'. Consequently, the bulk of the sentential complements were incorrectly added to the types involving postmodification by relative clauses. These problems are unavoidable, given the particular assumptions built into the LOB treebank analyses, unless a completely new analysis of the sample was undertaken.","One way of ameliorating this problem is to collapse some of the distinct rules in Table 1. A number of the distinct object grammar rules are present for 'technical' reasons connected with the use of fixed-arity unification and feature propagation by variable binding in the ANLT grammar formalism and parser (see Briscoe et al., 1987b,c for details). Therefore, we reduced the 54 object grammar rules to 36 hypothetical rules using our judgement to determine whether a distinction between rules was motivated by a linguistic generalisation or a technical consideration peculiar to the ANLT grammar formalism. In most cases, the linguistic generalisation is, in fact, present in the metagrammar rules but 'compiled out' in the automatic production of the equivalent object grammar. For example, rules with 'FOOT' in their name are wh-variants of other rules defined by metarules which state the manner in which they differ (systematically) from the non-wh versions. The resulting 36 hypothetical rules are given in Table 2 along with new rule application counts based on summing the counts for the merged actual rules. We also give the figures for the number of times each rule applied in the parsing of one token of each type. The final column presents a 'proportioned-up' figure based on multiplying the second column by 15.6 (since the parsed tokens represent 6.41% of the total sample). This column gives another perspective on the 'generalising power' of the rules involved. COMPARISON OF RULES AND TYPES","We suggested above that Sampson's argument against the generative concept of grammaticality is based on the assumption that each type in his original analysis will be associated with one nile. Sampson (1978a) found 747 types of which 468 were singleton types containing only one token, or 62.65% singleton types. In our reconstruction of Sampson's analysis we found 707 types of which 421 were singleton types, or 59.95% singleton Table 2- Applications of 36 Hypothetical Rules Rule Name Total No. No. in Par- Proptiond.-","of Applies. sea Tokens up Total CON J/N1 174 18 281 CON J/N2 805 106 1654 CONJ/N 27 17 265 N1/COORD 133 8 125 N2/COORD 389 42 655 N/COORD 13 8 125 N/ADJ 159 28 437 N/COMPOUND 1054 216 3367 N/NAME1 127 34 530 N/NAME2 206 47 733 N/NAME3 3 3 47 N1/APMOD 2324 288 4493 N1/INFMOD 2 2 31 NI[N 7170 598 9329 N1/POSS 13 9 140 N1/POSSMOD 3 3 47 N1/POST_APMOD 43 22 343 N1/PP 1132 67 1045 N1/PPMOD 777 144 2246 N1/REL 352 70 1092 NI/SFIN 2 2 31 N1/VPINF 6 4 62 N1/VPMOD 184 45 702 N2+/DET 4534 320 4992 N2+/PART 114 26 406 N2+/POSSNP 146 38 593 N2+/PRO 1975 29 452 N2+/PRO2 111 24 374 N2+/QUA 185 36 562 N2- 7819 552 8611 N2-/QUA 381 92 1435 N2/ADVP 79 37 577 N2/APPOS 274 157 2449 N2/COMPAR_I 8 6 94 N2/NEG 10 7 109 POSSNP 12 8 125 types. Sampson's commonest type contained 1135 tokens, ours contained 1519 tokens. Sampson (1987a) presents an analysis of his data which involves plotting a frequency-ordered list of NP types against the cumulative frequency of NP tokens in types of the same or lower frequency. This allows him to predict that 'rare' types, defined in terms of rate of occurrence relative to the rate of occurrence of the commonest type, will crop up fairly often in naturally occurring samples of NPs. For instahoe, if 'rare' is defined as occurring no more than once per 1000 occurrences of the commonest type, then about one example in 16 will represent some rare type. Therefore, a robust parser will need many 'rules' for such 'rare' types. Furthermore, there is no reason to expect the percentage of singleton types to fall as the sample size grows, implying that a robust parser of unrestricted text deploying a finite set of generative rules is out of the question.","Unfortunately, we cannot repeat Sampson's analysis for both our types and our rules because more than one rule is involved in the parsing of many of the types. Using the ANLT NP rules, an average of 5 rules applied - 260 - to each parsed token exemplifying a type, this figure drops to 3.18 when we take the average for the complete sample. Therefore, there is no direct correlation between rules and types. Nevertheless, Sampson's result follows directly from the high proportion of singleton types in his analysis and his assumption that one rule will suffice for each type; as he writes \"although a rare type is by definition represented by fewer tokens in a sample than a common type, as we move to lower type-frequencies the number of types possessing those frequencies grows, so that the total proportion of tokens representing all \"rare\" types remains significantly large even when the threshold of \"rarity\" is set at relatively extreme values.\" (Sampson, 1987:225, original emphasis).","The most basic and important difference between any grammar based on a one-to-one correspondence of rules and types and one such as the ANLT grammar is the enormous difference in its size; namely, 36 or 54 rules as opposed to 707 or 747 rules - reduction by a fac-tor between 13 and 20 approximately. This alone testifies to the greater generality of the ANLT NP grarmnar rules. However, there are also big differences in the patterns of application of rules between the two approaches. We can see this by looking at an ordered list of the rarest 10 types and comparing it with similar lists for the least applied actual and hypothetical 10 ANLT rules. The first column in Table 3 shows the number of tokens or rule applications. Following columns show numbers and percentages of types or rules associated with this number of tokens or applications.

Table 3 further demonstrates the greater generality of the rule-based analysis versus the type-based analysis for this sample of NPs. But in a sense, presenting the results in this manner misses the crux of Sampson's argument that any parsing system based on generative rules will need a large or open-ended set of spurious 'rules' which simply redescribe the data, because they will only apply once. In the actual rule set, 6 rules or 11.11% are dubious in this sense, but, as we argued above, these rules are only distinct for technical masons and in the hypothetical set no such rules exist. In any case, the proportion of actual dubious rules represents a considerable improvement on the proportion of singleton types (59.55%).","In (1) we present 3 (randomly-chosen) tokens of NPs from singleton types.

If Sampson's general thesis were correct' we should expect these to fall into singleton types and be syntactically exotic or mysterious. In fact, they are relatively easy to classify and the failure of the ANLT grammar results from either intentional or in some cases unintentional 'oversights' in the NP grammar. The failures can be classified, as illustrated in Table 4.

No rule was included in the grammar for dates, although these all consist of day (written 10 or lOth), month (unabbreviated), and year (in numerals). In 2 of the 4 cases the order of day and month is reversed. Ellipsis of the head noun in cases where there is a posmaodifier, for example, those who perpetuate it, causes a problem for the ANLT grammar because the determiner those cannot be analysed as a pronoun since - 261 - the grammar blocks modification of pronouns. This problem accounts for all the failures in this class.","Parenthetical or intrusive material which is not in apposition comes in two kinds. Firstly, there are cases of grammatical modification which occurs between the head noun and its arguments, as (2) illustrates. (2) our failure over two centuries to sustain any strong national musical tradition of our own These are not parsed as a result of the rigid assumptions about the ordering of arguments and modifiers built into the grammar. These need to be relaxed on the basis of some theory of 'heaviness' and its effect on order. Secondly, there are cases of genuine intrusive interjection or interpolation, as (3) illustrates. (3) little capsules , this big , - he brandished a teaspoon - with hundreds of tiny little red men inside them Such inwasive material can occur in most positions from a syntactic perspective. We suspect that a theory concerning their distribution would be largely pragmatic.","Some cases of 'right-node raising' of phrases are covered by the ANLT grammar. However, there is no rule for 'right-node raising' of nouns which would appear to be needed in NPs such as late 19th- and early 20th-century Rumania. Similarly, the grammar restricts NP premodifiers to AP, but a number of non-AP premodifiers occurred in the sample. These mostly involved measure phrases of some form, such as a 6 p.c tax free distribution, the 24fl passenger cabin, or the 5 shilling shares. There are 4 cases of unlike category coordination in AP modifiers like music both manuscript and printed and wine-glass or flared heels. The ANLT grammar allows this in post-copular position. but clearly the relevant generalisations should be extended to AP pre- and post-modifiers.","There are a number of cases where a premodifier selects a particular postmedifier. Comparative constructions with more and than are a well-known type which the ANLT grammar covers. However, there are many other more or less idiomatic phrases of this type, some of which could probably be subsumed by an expanded treatment of comparatives along existing lines, some of which could not. We give illustrative examples in (4). (4) such a crazy spin that I.~slie could not cope with it as much God's handiwork as a man as little as 0.001 at % of the addition elements In addition, the rule for noun compounding we have included does not allow compounds to contain anything other than lexical nouns. Cases of adjectives in compounds were treated as 'successes' by allowing the rule N/ADJ which converts adjectives such as poor to norms to deal with ellipsis of the head noun in the poor to overapply to adjectives in compounds. In this area, the ANLT grammar is clearly inadequate and needs improvement in obvious directions. The rule N/ADJ should be replaced by a lexical rule which states that '+human' adjectives can function as nouns, and compounding rules should be allowed to cross the 'boundary' between morphology and syntax, perhaps by allowing N-bar categories as well as nouns to 'compound'. These modifications would allow the illustrative examples in (5) to be counted as successes."]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["the third geologists' association excursion our well organised after care departments","The miscellaneous class contains 2 types where each occurs at the NP boundary, such as silicon , copper and magnesium each. We suspect that in these examples each should be treated as an adverbial modifier of the following VP.

We have reduced approximately 700 types to between 36 or 54 grammatical generalisations about NPs and shown that a minimally modified generative grammar developed (largely) independently of the test corpus is capable of covering 96.88% of the sample considered. We can demonstrate concretely why this should be so by considering the distinct single-constituent NP types from the treebank data exemplified by DT* JJ N*, DT* JJ JJ N*, and so forth. In the ANLT grammar this potentially infinite set of types is analysed through the recursive application of four rules of the following broad type: NP -> DET N1, N1 -> AP N1, AP -> A, N1 -> N. Thus a potentially infinite set of NP types is reduced to 4 grammatical generalisations.","We do not wish to claim that we have developed a 'watertight' perfect grammar of the English NP (although we do feel that the ANLT grammar has withstood this evaluation very well). There is still the 3.12% or 312 NPs that we are unable, at present, to analyse, and there is good reason to believe that \"all grammars leak\" slightly. However, there is little evidence in our results to suggest that a few rule-governed grammatical generafisations about naturally occurring NPs of English - 262 - do not effectively demarcate grammatical examples; or to suggest that the enterprise of generative grammar is doomed because of the high proportion of rules required to deal with residual, particular cases. On the contrary, our analysis of the failures demonstrates that, for the most part, they are not parsed because of oversights in the ANLT grammar, rather than because they are deviant in syntactically mysterious ways.","Sampson (1987a:226) concludes that the \"onus must surely be on those who believe in the possibility of NL analysis by means of comprehensive generative grammars to explain why they suppose that the shape of constituent type/token distribution curves will be markedly different from the shallow straight line suggested by our limited - but not insignificant - database.\" However, Sampson's result is suggested by"]},{"title":"lds analysis","paragraphs":["of this data, not the data itself. In this paper, we have demonstrated that a more satisfactory analysis of essentially the same data-base leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.","In other respects, the conclusions we should draw from this experiment are less positive. The development of wide-coverage grammars for robust parsing of unrestricted text will only be achieved through extensive evaluation using naturally occurring data. This, in turn, rests on the availability of suitably structured corpora from which the relevant data can be extracted automatically and on suitable software for semi-automatically testing rules against this data. The ANLT batch-mode parsing system proved completely inadequate to the latter task (largely because it was developed to check the grammar against a hand constructed set of short illustrative, deliberately unambiguous examples). Sampson (1987a) was able to perform a more sophisticated analysis of the treebank sample precisely because the original structuring of the data corresponded to his 'theory of grammar and grammatical analysis'. The problems we have had making use of his analysis to preliminarily classify the same data in order to evaluate the ANLT NP grammar highlight the impossibility of developing a corpus databank structured in some grammatically 'descriptive' or 'uncontroversial' fashion (pace Sampson, 1987b)."]},{"title":"FOOTNOTES","paragraphs":["1.
