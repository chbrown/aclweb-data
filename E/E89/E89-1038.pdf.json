We have described some of the motivations for and the basic organisation of the combined framework in Steiner and Sch~tz (1988) and Bateman, Kasper, Schfitz, and Steiner (1989). Here we present in more detail some of the linguistic implications of the research and the promise it bears for furthering understanding of the translation process.","Although developed separately and for quite different reasons, there is a decisive link between the two components in that ideas from a single linguistic theory, systemic-functional linguistics (e.g. Halliday, 1985) have been incorporated independently in both projects. A partial implementation of the grammatical stratum of organisation found in Systemic Func-tional Grammar (SFG) provides the core of Penman's linguistic capabilities (Mann and Matthiessen, 1985), whereas there is a strong input from SFG in the semantic interpretation of ET-D's dependency struc-tures (Steiner, Schmidt and Zelinsky-Wibbelt, 1988).

These interface representations are semantically interpreted dependency struc-tures; they are described in more detail in Section 3.3. Each level is defined by a level-specific grammar and a lexicon. The connection between adjacent levels is established with translator-rules which define a tree-to-tree mapping between level representations. The main operation involved in the mapping is unification, i.e. the unification between already built objects and rules. Transfer between two languages takes place as a translation between the interface level representations of the source language (SL) and the target language (TL).","1Our co-operation is not restricted to the Eurotra Engineering Framework formalism; other versions use the CAT2 formalism (Sharp, 1988; Sch~tz and Sharp 1988)."]},{"title":"- 282 - 2.2 Penman Generation Module","paragraphs":["The English generation component of our proposed MT system is Penman (Mann, 1983). Penman has been designed to be a portable, reusable text generation facility which can be embedded in many kinds of computational systems. The linguistic core of Penman is Nigel (Mann and Matthiessen, 1983), a large systemic-functional grammar of English based on the work of ttalliday (1985) with contributions made by several other systemic linguists. Nigel is a large network of interdependent points of minimal grammatical contrast, called systems. Each of these systems defines a collection of alternatives called grammatical features. The semantic interface of the Nigel grammar is defined by a set of inquiries that control choices of grammatical features by mediating the flow of information between the grammar and external sources of information.","Penman also provides structure for some of these external sources of information, including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and entities, called the upper model. The upper model is typically used to mediate between the organisation of knowledge found in an application domain and the kind of organisation that is most convenient for implementing the grammar's inquiries. We have made crucial use of the upper model in constructing our combination of the two components. In effect, the upper model can often mediate between the results of the MT analysis, expressed in ET-D Interface Structures, and the input that must be specified for Penman, expressed in the Penman Sentence Plan Language (SPL) (Kasper, 1989). Each of these information sources, the upper model, the Penman SPL, and the ET-D Interface Structures will now be described in detail."]},{"title":"3 Components of the German-English Interface 3.1 Penman's Upper Model","paragraphs":["Perhaps the crucial task for text generation is to be able to control linguistic resources so as to make the generated text conform to what is to be expressed. In Penman this is the responsibility of the grammar's inquiry semantics. Furthermore, a large subset of Penman's inquiries are taxonomic. These relate particular instances of what is to be expressed to the categories of semantic organisation that the grammar's semantics requires. These categories, and the relationships among them, constitute the upper model.","The upper model serves to organize the proposi-tional content that needs to be expressed in text; in systemic-functional linguistics, this range of meaning is called ideational. Many ideational.inquiries can be expressed in terms of the classifications of concepts that the upper model provides. These classifications form an inheritance hierarchy that organises concepts according to how they may be expressed in English. Thus, when an application domain for which Penman is to generate language connects its concepts to those of the upper model, a single inheritance hierarchy is formed from which the grammar's inquiries can determine information about how any particular domain concept may be expressed in English. We refer to this single inheritance hierarchy formed from the application domain model and the upper model as the combined model. Inquiries that need to determine whether an application domain model concept belongs to the class defined by some upper model concept can then rely on simple inheritance inferences. For example, this type of inference allows Penman to ascertain that a domain entity is a process, rather than an object, and so should be expressed as a verb rather than as a nominal phrase. Much finer distinctions are drawn by the actual upper model, which currently contains approximately 200 concepts.","By virtue of their positions in the inheritance hierarchy, entities in the combined model also inherit roles from their ancestors. These can serve to define, for example, the types of participants that processes may have, or the types of qualities that may be ascribed to particular objects. Both inheritance of class membership and of roles find significant use in the construc-tion and interpretation of expressions in the Penman interface notation SPL."]},{"title":"3.2 Penman Interface Notation - SPL","paragraphs":["Penman accepts demands for text to be generated in the SPL notation. SPL expressions are lists of terms describing the types of entities and the particular features of those entities to be expressed in English. The types of SPL terms are interpreted with respect to the knowledge base of general conceptual categories defined in the upper model. When the concepts of Penman's upper model are instantiated by more specific concepts from an application program's knowledge base (i.e. world knowledge specific to the domain of the application), then application concepts can be used directly in the SPL expression. The features of SPL terms are either semantic relations to be expressed, drawn from the relations]roles defined by the combined model or direct specifications of responses to Penman's inquiries. This latter possibility provides for the input of information from other sources of knowledge known to be necessary for controlling generation, e.g. text planning information and speaker-hearer models. These types of meaning fall outside the kind of taxonomic, 'ideational' meanings defined in the upper model and so require separate treatment. Currently we specify information of this type as direct responses to Penman's inquiries since the inquiries are not limited to ideational meanings.

They represent dependency relationships between constituents by structural embedding, and additional linguistic information in their feature structures, including semantic relations and semantic (lexical) features, such as time, diathesis, modality, mood, topic, focus, determination and number. An example of an IS-representation is given in Figure 2. In this representation we can see at the topmost node the features s-TENSE and s_ASPECT which are used to compute the appropriate time information for the SPL expression. The German simul/durative ('present') has to be expressed in English with a 'present perfect' construction. The feature nclass--proper is responsible for the fact that in the SPL expression we can simple use the keyword macro :name which indicates any propernoun lexical item. The features d.is]rame and argi, 1 < i < 4, are used to determine the process type (g-associative) and its roles (g-attribuant, g-associated). The feature g.scope in the SPL representation is in-serted from the IS feature d_pform=in of the NP governed by Anwendung.","These features axe referring to categories of an upper model that we have constructed for German (UM~); the UMG is essentially a re-expression of the transitivity relations worked out in Fawcett (1987). :Just as for the Penman upper model for English, which we shall now label UME, the German upper model is not a representation of a particular sentence: it is a representation of concepts into which IS roles and role-configurations are mapped. The UMG concepts then","2This specification shows the finest level of detail of grammar control that may be given in an SPL expression. In practise, when using SPL it is possible to abbreviate or to default commonly used combinations of inquiry responses; thus, for example, it is possible to replace all of the :speech-act, :speech-act-id, and :e~ent-time features shown in Figure 1 with the more coarsely-grained, specification :speech-act ~sssrt :tense present-in-past For more details see Kasper (1989). also stand in inheritance relationships to each other. Furthermore, a concept in UM~ may have slots (roles) which can be filled by other concepts, of specified types (role restrictions). Roles of the German IS grammar are linked to concepts of UM~ through the specialize predicate. When an IS is expressed in an SPL representation, the roles (st features) of IS are mostly substituted by the corresponding UMG concepts.","Roles as well as features of IS may also be mapped into inquiry responses during transfer into SPL, as described in Section 4.3. The fact that for the time being the UMG is almost isomorphic to a representation of the predicate-argument part of the German IS grammar is more due to time constraints than to any far reaching claims about the mutual relationships between an IS and an Upper Model, although the nature of that relationship is interesting and is receiving study in its own right."]},{"title":"4 The Nature of the Translation Process","paragraphs":["It is important from a conceptual point of view to keep apart the three levels of representation involved here: ET-D IS, UM~, and a description of the German sentence in SPL. The basic form of the translation process is to transfer ET-D IS representations into Penman SPL representations. As ET-D IS and Penman SPL representations are both feature-based dependency structures, the formal aspects of the transfer from ET-D IS into Penman SPL are not very complicated. Determining an appropriate mapping for the content of particular values within ET-D IS representations is by far a more challenging aspect of this translation process.","The translation process is achieved by employing three principal levels of transfer, which are described in detail below. The product of this multi-level transfer is an SPL representation of the English translation of the original German sentence, which may then drive generation by Penman as in any other application domain. The translation process as a whole is summarised in Figure 3. The general strategy of this translation process should also generalise to future applications in a multi-lingual MT environment."]},{"title":"4.1 Upper model transfer","paragraphs":["Preparatory to being able to transfer IS representations into corresponding SPL expressions for German sentences, a mapping needs to be established between the categories of UMo and appropriate categories of Penman's English specific upper model (UME).

This type of transfer is used for semantic information of kinds not approI)riate for inclusion in an upper model, e.g., textual organisation information, non-hierarchical conceptual information and speech act information. Penman has a rich variety of inquiries dealing with such information and so makes available a large set of resources and capabilities for any system that requires English as output.","Information of these kinds is notoriously difficult for the usual types of syntactic transfer strategies. Determiner selection, and, in particular, correct translation of the indefinite and definite articles are another case of this. For example, the IS semantic features representing determination are translated into the inquiry responses that are responsible for control-ling determiner selection in Nigel as follows: {def = yes & nb = sing} =¢. {:identifiability-q identifiable & :multiplicity-q unitary & :singularity-q singular}. Thus, the features expressing definiteness in IS are mapped into inquiry responses giving information about whether a given phrase is identifiable; those features expressing number are mapped into responses concerning whether the concept is to be expressed as a single entity or as several distinct entities. These are some of the semantic dimensions around which NigeI organises the selection of determiners and quantifiers in English (for a fuller account of Nigel's treatment, see: Bateman and Matthiessen, 1988; also, for an account of the ET-D approach, see: Steiner, Winter and Zellnsky-Wibbelt, 1987).

Still, enough common ground has been preserved in order to make a transfer of ET-D time features (i.e. semantic), rather than tense features (morpho-syntactic), an interesting and possible enterprise. Tenses encode complex relationships between time of speaking, reference time, and time of event, in interaction with Adverbiais in particular, and it is only with the help of a type of transfer that gives access to this level of detail that we can arrive at the English 'present perfect tense' as a translation of the German 'present' plus a time adverbial.

One possible answer to this is that what needs to be preserved at least is the truth value of sentences and their translations. While this may serve as a useful bottom line from which to start, it has long been recognised to be no more than that. Many researchers argue that we also need to preserve the essential features of thematic structure and information structure.
