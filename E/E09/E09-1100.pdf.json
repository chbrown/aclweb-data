As Chinese text is made up of character sequences rather than word sequences, word in Chinese is not so natural a concept as in English, nor is word easy to be defined without argument for such a language. There-fore we propose a character-level dependency scheme to represent primary linguistic relationships within a Chinese sentence. The usefulness of character dependencies are verified through two specialized dependency parsing tasks. The first is to handle trivial character dependencies that are equally transformed from traditional word boundaries. The second furthermore considers the case that annotated internal character dependencies inside a word are involved. Both of these results from character-level dependency parsing are positive.

Thank the first anonymous reviewer who points this fact. brings the argument about how to determine the word-hood in Chinese. Linguists’ views about what is a Chinese word diverge so greatly that multiple word segmentation standards have been proposed for computational linguistics tasks since the first Bakeoff (Bakeoff-1, or Bakeoff-2003)3 (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).","Up to Bakeoff-4, seven word segmentation standards have been proposed. However, this does not effectively solve the open problem what a Chinese word should exactly be but raises another is-sue: what a segmentation standard should be selected for the successive application. As word often plays a basic role for the further language processing, if it cannot be determined in a unified way, then all successive tasks will be affected more or less.","Motivated by dependency representation for syntactic parsing since (Collins, 1999) that has been drawn more and more interests in recent years, we suggest that character-level dependencies can be adopted to alleviate this difficulty in Chinese processing. If we regard traditional word boundary as a linear representation for neighbored characters, then character-level dependencies can provide a way to represent non-linear relations between non-neighbored characters. To show that character dependencies can be useful, we develop a parsing scheme for the related learning task and demonstrate its effectiveness.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We show such three examples as the following.","The first example is from the MSRA segmented corpus of Bakeoff-2 (Bakeoff-2005) (Emerson, 2005):","","/","/","/ ","","","","","","","","","/","","/","","/","/ a / piece of / “ / Beijing City Beijing Opera OK Sodality / member / entrance / ticket / ” As the guideline of MSRA standard requires any organization’s full name as a word, many long words in this form are frequently encountered. Though this type of ‘words’ may be regarded as an effective unit to some extent, some smaller meaningful constituents can be still identified inside them. Some researchers argue that these should be seen as phrases rather than words. In fact, e.g., a machine translation system will have to segment this type of words into some smaller units for a proper translation.","The second example is from the PKU corpus of Bakeoff-2,","","","/","/","","/",""," China / in / South Africa / embassy (the Chinese embassy in South Africa) This example demonstrates how researchers can also feel inconvenient if an organization name is segmented into pieces. Though the word ‘"," ","’(embassy) is right after ‘","","’(South Africa) in the above phrase, the embassy does not belong to South Africa but China, and it is only located in South Africa.","The third example is an abbreviation that makes use of the characteristics of Chinese characters.",""," /","/","/ Week / one / three / five (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) This example shows that there will be in a dilemma to perform segmentation over these characters. If a segmentation position locates before ‘","’(three) or ‘","’(five), then this will make them meaningless or losing its original meaning at least because either of these two characters should logically follow the substring ‘","","’ (week) to construct the expected word ‘","","","’(Wednesday) or ‘","","","’ (Friday). Otherwise, to make all the above five characters as a word will have to ignore all these logical dependent relations among these characters and segment it later for a proper tackling as the above first example.","All these examples suggest that dependencies exist between discontinuous characters, and word boundary representation is insufficient to handle these cases. This motivates us to introduce character dependencies."]},{"title":"3 Character-Level Dependency Parsing","paragraphs":["Character dependency is proposed as an alternative to word boundary. The idea itself is extremely simple, character dependencies inside sequence are annotated or formally defined in the similar way that syntactic dependencies over words are usually annotated.","We will initially develop a character-level dependency parsing scheme in this section. Especially, we show character dependencies, even those trivial ones that are equally transformed from pre-defined word boundaries, can be effectively captured in a parsing way. 3.1 Formularization Using a character-level dependency representation, we first show how a word segmentation task can be transformed into a dependency parsing problem. Since word segmentation is traditionally formularized as an unlabeled character chunking task since (Xue, 2003), only unlabeled dependencies are concerned in the transformation. There are many ways to transform chunks in a sequence into dependency representation. However, for the sake of simplicity, only well-formed and projective output sequences are considered for our processing.","Borrowing the notation from (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), an unlabeled dependency graph is formally defined as follows: An unlabeled dependency graph for a string of cliques (i.e., words and characters) W = 880 Figure 1: Two character dependency schemes w1...wn is an unlabeled directed graph D = (W, A), where","(a) W is the set of ordered nodes, i.e. clique tokens in the input string, ordered by a linear precedence relation <,","(b) A is a set of unlabeled arcs (wi, wj ), where wi, wj ∈ W ,","If (wi, wj ) ∈ A, wi is called the head of wj and wj a dependent of wi. Traditionally, the notation wi → wj means (wi, wj ) ∈ A; wi →∗ wj denotes the reflexive and transitive closure of the (unlabeled) arc relation. We assume that the designed dependency structure satisfies the following common constraints in existing literature (Nivre, 2006).","(1) D is weakly connected, that is, the corresponding undirected graph is connected. (CONNECTEDNESS)","(2) The graph D is acyclic, i.e., if wi → wj then not wj →∗","wi. (ACYCLICITY)","(3) There is at most one arc (wi, wj ) ∈ A, ∀wj ∈ W . (SINGLE-HEAD)","(4) An arc wi → wk is projective iff, for every word wj occurring between wi and wk in the string (wi < wj < wk or wi > wj > wk), wi →∗","wj . (PROJECTIVITY)","We say that D is well-formed iff it is acyclic and connected, and D is projective iff every arcs in A are projective. Note that the above four conditions entail that the graph D is a single-rooted tree. For an arc wi → wj, if wi < wj, then it is called right-arc, otherwise left-arc.","Following the above four constraints and considering segmentation characteristics, we may have two character dependency representation schemes as shown in Figure 1 by using a series of trivial dependencies inside or outside a word. Note that we use arc direction to distinguish connected and segmented relation among characters. The scheme with the assistant root node before the sequence in Figure 1 is called Scheme B, and the other Scheme E. 3.2 Shift-reduce Parsing According to (McDonald and Nivre, 2007), all data-driven models for dependency parsing that have been proposed in recent years can be described as either graph-based or transition-based. Since both dependency schemes that we construct for parsing are well-formed and projective, the latter is chosen as the parsing framework for the sake of efficiency. In detail, a shift-reduce method is adopted as in (Nivre, 2003).","The method is step-wise and a classifier is used to make a parsing decision step by step. In each step, the classifier checks a clique pair 4",", namely, TOP, the top of a stack that consists of the processed cliques, and, INPUT, the first clique in the unprocessed sequence, to determine if a dependent relation should be established between them. Besides two arc-building actions, a shift action and a reduce action are also defined, as follows,","Left-arc: Add an arc from INPUT to TOP and pop the stack.","Right-arc: Add an arc from TOP to INPUT and push INPUT onto the stack.","Reduce: Pop TOP from the stack.","Shift: Push INPUT onto the stack.","In this work, we adopt a left-to-right arc-eager parsing model, that means that the parser scans the input sequence from left to right and right dependents are attached to their heads as soon as possible (Hall et al., 2007). In the implementation, as for Scheme E, all four actions are required to pass through an input sequence. However, only three actions, i.e., reduce action will never be used, are needed for Scheme B. 3.3 Learning Model and Features While memory-based and margin-based learning approaches such as support vector machines are popularly applied to shift-reduce parsing, we apply maximum entropy model as the learning model for efficient training and producing some comparable results. Our implementation of maximum entropy adopts L-BFGS algorithm for parameter optimization as usual. No additional feature selection techniques are used.","With notations defined in Table 1, a feature set as shown in Table 2 is adopted. Here, we explain some terms in Tables 1 and 2. 4 Here, clique means character or word in a sequence,","which depends on what constructs the sequence. 881 Table 1: Feature Notations Notation Meaning s The character in the top of stack s−1,... The first character below the top of stack, etc. i, i+1,... The first (second) character in the","unprocessed sequence, etc. dprel Dependent label h Head lm Leftmost child rm Rightmost child rn Right nearest child char Character form . ’s, i.e., ‘s.dprel’ means dependent label","of character in the top of stack + Feature combination, i.e., ‘s.char+i.char’","means both s.char and i.char work as a","feature function.","Since we only considered unlabeled dependency parsing, dprel means the arc direction from the head, either left or right. The feature cur-root returns the root of a partial parsing tree that includes a specified node. The feature cnseq returns a substring started from a given character. It checks the direction of the arc that passes the given character and collects all characters with the same arc direction to yield an output substring until the arc direction is changed. Note that all combinational features concerned with this one can be regarded as word-level features.","The feature av is derived from unsupervised segmentation as in (Zhao and Kit, 2008a), and the accessor variety (AV) (Feng et al., 2004) is adopted as the unsupervised segmentation criterion. The AV value of a substring s is defined as AV (s) = min{Lav(s), Rav (s)}, where the left and right AV values Lav(s) and Rav(s) are defined, respectively, as the numbers of its distinct predecessor and successor characters. In this work, AV values for substrings are derived from unlabeled training and test corpora by substring counting. Multiple features are used to represent substrings of various lengths identified by the AV criterion. Formally put, the feature function for a n-character substring s with a score AV (s) is defined as","avn = t, if 2t ≤ AV (s) < 2t+1",", (1) where t is an integer to logarithmize the score and taken as the feature value. For an overlap character of several substrings, we only choose the one with","Table 2: Features for Parsing","Basic Extension","x.char itself, its previous two and next two characters, and all bigrams within the five-character window.

That is, the decoding of a parsing method for word segmentation will be extremely fast. The time complexity of decoding will be 2L for Scheme E, and L for Scheme B, where L is the length of the input sequence.","However, it is somewhat complicated as Markovian features are involved. Following the work of (Duan et al., 2007), the decoding in this case is to search a parsing action sequence with the maximal probability. Sdi = argmax ∏ i p(di|di−1di−2...), where Sdi is the object parsing action sequence, p(di|di−1...) is the conditional probability, and di is i-th parsing action. We use a beam search algorithm as in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to find the object parsing action sequence. The time complexity of this beam search algorithm will be 4BL for Scheme E and 3BL for Scheme B, where B is the beam width. 3.5 Related Methods Among character-based learning techniques for word segmentation, we may identify two main 882 types, classification (GOH et al., 2004) and tagging (Low et al., 2005). Both character classification and tagging need to define the position of character inside a word. Traditionally, the four tags, b, m, e, and s stand, respectively, for the beginning, midle, end of a word, and a single-character as word since (Xue, 2003). The following n-gram features from (Xue, 2003; Low et al., 2005) are used as basic features, (a) Cn(n = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2), (b) CnCn+1(n = −2, −1, 0, 1), (c) C−1C1, where C stands for a character and the subscripts for the relative order to the current character C0. In addition, the feature av that is defined in equation (1) is also taken as an option. avn (n=1,...,5) is applied as feature for the current character.","While word segmentation is conducted as a classification task, each individual character will be simply assigned a tag with the maximal probability given by the classifier. In this case, we restore word boundary only according to two tags b and s. However, the output tag sequence given by character classification may include illegal tag transition (e.g., m is after e.). In (Low et al., 2005), a dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to find a tag sequence with the maximal joint probability from all legal tag sequences. If such a dynamic programming decoding is adopted, then this method for word segmentation is regarded as character tagging 5",".","The time complexity of character-based classification method for decoding is L, which is the best result in decoding velocity. As dynamic programming is applied, the time complexity will be 16L with four tags.","Recently, conditional random fields (CRFs) be-comes popular for word segmentation since it provides slightly better performance than maximum entropy method does (Peng et al., 2004). However, CRFs is a structural learning tool rather than a simple classification framework. As shift-reduce parsing is a typical step-wise method that checks","5","Someone may argue that maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM) is truly a tagging tool. Yes, this method was initialized by (Xue, 2003). However, our empirical results show that MEMM never outperforms maximum entropy plus dynamic programming decoding as (Low et al., 2005) in Chinese word segmentation. We also know that the latter reports the best results in Bakeoff-2. This is why MEMM method is excluded from our comparison. each character one by one, it is reasonable to compare it to a classification method over characters. 3.6 Evaluation Results Table 3: Corpus size of Bakeoff-2 in number of words","AS CityU MSRA PKU","Training(M) 5.45 1.46 2.37 1.1 Test(K) 122 41 107 104","The experiments in this section are performed in all four corpora from Bakeoff-2.

To compute the word F-score, all parsing results will be restored to word boundaries according to the direction of output arcs.

As the feature preact is involved, a beam search algorithm with width 5 is used to decode, otherwise, a simple shift-reduce decoding is used. We see that the performance given by Scheme E is much better than that by Scheme B. The results of character-based classification and tagging methods are at the bottom of Table 46",". It is observed that the parsing method outperforms classification and tagging method without Markovian features or decoding throughout the whole sequence. As full features are used, the former and the latter provide the similar performance.","Due to using a global model like CRFs, our previous work in (Zhao et al., 2006; Zhao and Kit, 2008c) reported the best results over the evaluated corpora of Bakeoff-2 until now7",". Though those results are slightly better than the results here, we still see that the results of character-level dependency parsing approach (Scheme E) are comparable to those state-of-the-art ones on each evaluated corpus."]},{"title":"4 Character Dependencies inside a Word","paragraphs":["We further consider exploiting annotated character dependencies inside a word (internal dependencies). A parsing task for these internal dependencies incorporated with trivial external dependencies 8","that are transformed from common word boundaries are correspondingly proposed using the same parsing way as the previous section. 4.1 Annotation of Internal Dependencies In Subsection 3.1, we assign trivial character dependencies inside a word for the parsing task of word segmentation, i.e., each character as the head of its predecessor or successor. These trivial formally defined dependencies may be against the syntactic or semantic senses of those characters, as we have discussed in Section 2. Now we will consider human annotated character dependencies inside a word.","As such an corpus with annotated internal dependencies has not been available until 6","Only the results of open track are reported in (Low et al., 2005), while we give a comparison following closed track rules, so, our results here are not comparable to those of (Low et al., 2005). 7","As n-gram features are used, F-scores in (Zhao et al., 2006) are, AS:0.953, CityU:0.948, MSRA:0.974,PKU:0.952. 8","We correspondingly call dependencies that mark word boundary external dependencies that correspond to internal dependencies. now, we launched an annotation job based on UPUC segmented corpus of Bakeoff-3(Bakeoff-2006)(Levow, 2006). The training corpus is with 880K characters and test corpus 270K. However, the essential of the annotation job is actually conducted in a lexicon.","After a lexicon is extracted from CTB segmented corpus, we use a top-down strategy to an-notate internal dependencies inside these words from the lexicon. A long word is first split into some smaller constituents, and dependencies among these constituents are determined, character dependencies inside each constituents are then annotated. Some simple rules are adopted to determine dependency relation, e.g., modifiers are kept marking as dependants and the only rest constituent will be marked as head at last. Some words are hard to determine internal dependency relation, such as foreign names, e.g., ‘ ","","’(Portugal) and ‘","","","","’(Maradona), and uninterrupted words (","","","), e.g., ‘","","’(ant) and ‘","","’(clover). In this case, we simply adopt a series of linear dependencies with the last character as head to mark these words.","In the previous section, we have shown that Scheme E is a better dependency representation for encoding word boundaries. Thus annotated internal dependencies are used to replace those trivial internal dependencies in Scheme E to obtain the corpus that we require. Note that now we cannot distinguish internal and external dependencies only according to the arc direction any more, as both left- and right-arc can appear for internal character dependency representation. Thus two labeled left arcs, external and internal, are used for the annotation disambiguation. As internal dependencies are introduced, we find that some words (about 10%) are constructed by two or more parallel constituent parts according to our annotations, this not only lets two labeled arcs insufficiently distinguish internal-and external dependencies, but also makes parsing extremely difficult, namely, a great amount of non-projective dependencies will appear if we directly introduce these internal dependencies. Again, we adopt a series of linear dependencies with the last character as head to represent internal dependencies for these words by ignor-ing their parallel constituents.

A series of similar word segmentation experiments as in Subsection 3.6 are performed. Note that this task is slightly different from the previous one, as it is a five-class parsing action classification task as left arc has two labels to differ internal and external dependencies. Thus a different feature set has to be used. However, all input sequences are still projective.","Features listed in Table 5 are adopted for the parsing task that annotated character dependencies exist inside words.

The results of a character-level dependency parser can be comparable with traditional methods. Secondly, we consider annotated character dependencies inside a word. We show that a parser can still effectively capture both these annotated internal character dependencies and trivial external dependencies that are transformed from word boundaries.
