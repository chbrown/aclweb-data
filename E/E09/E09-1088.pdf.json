However, establishing an effective and efficient inference method on latent conditional models remains a question. In this paper, we describe the latent-dynamic inference (LDI), which is able to produce the optimal label sequence on latent conditional models by using efficient search strategy and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we describe a straightforward solution on approximating the LDI, and show that the approximated LDI performs as well as the exact LDI, while the speed is much faster. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed inference algorithm out-performs existing inference methods on a variety of natural language processing tasks."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["When data have distinct sub-structures, models exploiting latent variables are advantageous in learning (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008). Actually, discriminative probabilistic latent variable models (DPLVMs) have recently become popular choices for performing a variety of tasks with sub-structures, e.g., vision recognition (Morency et al., 2007), syntactic parsing (Petrov and Klein, 2008), and syntactic chunking (Sun et al., 2008). Morency et al. (2007) demonstrated that DPLVM models could efficiently learn sub-structures of natural problems, and outperform several widely-used conventional models, e.g., support vector machines (SVMs), conditional random fields (CRFs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Petrov and Klein (2008) reported on a syntactic parsing task that DPLVM models can learn more compact and accurate grammars than the conventional techniques without latent variables. The effectiveness of DPLVMs was also shown on a syntactic chunking task by Sun et al. (2008).","DPLVMs outperform conventional learning models, as described in the aforementioned publications. However, inferences on the latent conditional models are remaining problems. In conventional models such as CRFs, the optimal label path can be efficiently obtained by the dynamic programming. However, for latent conditional models such as DPLVMs, the inference is not straightforward because of the inclusion of latent variables.","In this paper, we propose a new inference algorithm, latent dynamic inference (LDI), by systematically combining an efficient search strategy with the dynamic programming. The LDI is an exact inference method producing the most probable label sequence. In addition, we also propose an approximated LDI algorithm for faster speed. We show that the approximated LDI performs as well as the exact one. We will also discuss a post-processing method for the LDI algorithm: the minimum bayesian risk reranking.","The subsequent section describes an overview of DPLVM models. We discuss the probability distribution of DPLVM models, and present the LDI inference in Section 3. Finally, we report experimental results and begin our discussions in Section 4 and Section 5. 772 y1 y2 ym xmx2x1 h1 h2 hm xmx2x1 ymy2y1  Figure 1: Comparison between CRF models and DPLVM models on the training stage. x represents the observation sequence, y represents labels and h represents the latent variables assigned to the labels.

Each yj is a class label for the j’th token of a word sequence, and is a member of a set Y of possible class labels. For each sequence, the model also assumes a sequence of latent variables h = h1, h2, . . . , hm, which is unobservable in training examples.","The DPLVM model is defined as follows (Morency et al., 2007): P (y|x, Θ) = ∑ h P (y|h, x, Θ)P (h|x, Θ), (1) where Θ represents the parameter vector of the model. DPLVM models can be seen as a natural extension of CRF models, and CRF models can be seen as a special case of DPLVMs that employ only one latent variable for each label.","To make the training and inference efficient, the model is restricted to have disjointed sets of latent variables associated with each class label. Each hj is a member in a set Hyj of possible latent variables for the class label yj. H is defined as the set of all possible latent variables, i.e., the union of all Hyj sets. Since sequences which have any hj /∈ Hyj will by definition have P (y|hj, x, Θ) = 0, the model can be further defined as: P (y|x, Θ) = ∑","h∈Hy 1×...×Hym P (h|x, Θ), (2) where P (h|x, Θ) is defined by the usual conditional random field formulation: P (h|x, Θ) = exp Θ·f (h, x)","∑ ∀h exp Θ·f (h, x) , (3) in which f (h, x) is a feature vector.

Nevertheless, we had an interesting observation on DPLVM models that they normally had a highly concentrated probability mass, i.e., the major probability are distributed on top-n ranked latent paths.","Figure 2 shows the probability distribution of a DPLVM model using a L2 regularizer with the variance σ2","= 1.0. As can be seen, the probability distribution is highly concentrated, e.g., 90% of the probability is distributed on top-800 latent paths.","Based on this observation, we propose an inference algorithm for DPLVMs by efficiently combining search and dynamic programming. 3.1 LDI Inference In the inference stage, given a test sequence x, we want to find the most probable label sequence, y∗",":","y∗ = argmax","yP (y|x, Θ∗ ). (5) For latent conditional models like DPLVMs, the y∗","cannot directly be produced by the Viterbi algorithm because of the incorporation of latent variables.","In this section, we describe an exact inference algorithm, the latent-dynamic inference (LDI), for producing the optimal label sequence y∗","on DPLVMs (see Figure 3).

Then it maps each of these to its associated label paths and uses a method to compute their exact probabilities. It can continue to generate the next best latent path and the associated label path until there is not enough probability mass left to beat the best label path.","In detail, an A∗","search algorithm1","(Hart et al., 1968) with a Viterbi heuristic function is adopted to produce top-n latent paths, h1, h2, . . . hn. In addition, a forward-backward-style algorithm is used to compute the exact probabilities of their corresponding label paths, y1, y2, . . . yn. The model then tries to determine the optimal label path based on the top-n statistics, without enumerating the remaining low-probability paths, which could be exponentially enormous.","The optimal label path y∗","is ready when the following “exact-condition” is achieved: P (y1|x, Θ)−(1− ∑ yk∈LPn P (yk|x, Θ)) ≥ 0, (6) where y1 is the most probable label sequence in current stage. It is straightforward to prove that y∗","= y1, and further search is unnecessary. This is because the remaining probability mass, 1− ∑","yk∈LPn P (yk|x, Θ), cannot beat the current","optimal label path in this case. 1 A∗","search and its variants, like beam-search, are widely","used in statistical machine translation. Compared to other","search techniques, an interesting point of A∗","search is that it","can produce top-n results one-by-one in an efficient manner. Definition: Proj(h) = y ⇐⇒ hj ∈ Hyj f or j = 1 . . . m; P (h) = P (h|x, Θ); P (y) = P (y|x, Θ). Input: weight vector Θ, and feature vector F (h, x).

Figure 3: The exact LDI inference for latent conditional models. In the algorithm, HeapPop means popping the next hypothesis from the A∗","heap; By the definition of the A∗","search, this hypothesis (on the top of the heap) should be the latent path with maximum probability in current stage. 3.2 Implementation Issues We have presented the framework of the LDI inference. Here, we describe the details on implementing its two important components: designing the heuristic function, and an efficient method to compute the probabilities of label path.","As described, the A∗","search can produce top-n results one-by-one using a heuristic function (the backward term). In the implementation, we use the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) to compute the admissible heuristic function for the forward-style A∗","search:","Heui(hj) = max h′ i=hj∧h′","∈HP|h|","i P ′ (h′","|x, Θ∗ ), (7) where h′","i = hj represents a partial latent path started from the latent variable hj. HP |h| i rep-","resents all possible partial latent paths from the 774 position i to the ending position, |h|. As described in the Viterbi algorithm, the backward term, Heui(hj), can be efficiently computed by using dynamic programming to reuse the terms (e.g., Heui+1(hj)) in previous steps. Because this Viterbi heuristic is quite good in practice, this way we can produce the exact top-n latent paths efficiently (see efficiency comparisons in Section 5), even though the original problem is NP-hard.","The probability of a label path, P (yn) in Figure 3, can be efficiently computed by a forward-backward algorithm with a restriction on the target label path: P (y|x, Θ) = ∑","h∈Hy 1×...×Hym P (h|x, Θ). (8) 3.3 An Approximated Version of the LDI By simply setting a threshold value on the search step, n, we can approximate the LDI, i.e., LDI-Approximation (LDI-A). This is a quite straightforward method for approximating the LDI. In fact, we have also tried other methods for approximation. Intuitively, one alternative method is to design an approximated “exact condition” by using a factor, α, to estimate the distribution of the remaining probability: P (y1|x, Θ)−α(1− ∑ yk∈LPnP (yk|x, Θ)) ≥ 0. (9) For example, if we believe that at most 50% of the unknown probability, 1 −","∑","yk∈LPn P (yk|x, Θ), can be distributed on a single label path, we can set α = 0.5 to make a loose condition to stop the inference. At first glance, this seems to be quite natural. However, when we compared this alternative method with the aforementioned approximation on search steps, we found that it worked worse than the latter, in terms of performance and speed. Therefore, we focus on the approximation on search steps in this paper.","3.4 Comparison with Existing Inference Methods In Matsuzaki et al. (2005), the Best Hidden Path inference (BHP) was used:","yBHP = argmax y","P (hy|x, Θ∗ ), (10) where hy ∈ Hy1 × . . . × Hym. In other words, the Best Hidden Path is the label sequence which is directly projected from the optimal latent path h∗",". The BHP inference can be seen as a special case of the LDI, which replaces the marginalization-operation over latent paths with the max-operation.","In Morency et al. (2007), y∗","is estimated by the Best Point-wise Marginal Path (BMP) inference. To estimate the label yj of token j, the marginal probabilities P (hj = a|x, Θ) are computed for all possible latent variables a ∈ H. Then the marginal probabilities are summed up according to the disjoint sets of latent variables Hyj and the optimal label is estimated by the marginal probabilities at each position i:","yBMP (i) = argmax yi∈Y","P (yi|x, Θ∗ ), (11) where P (yi = a|x, Θ) =","∑ h∈Ha P (h|x, Θ) ∑","h P (h|x, Θ) . (12)","Although the motivation is similar, the exact LDI (LDI-E) inference described in this paper is a different algorithm compared to the BLP inference (Sun et al., 2008). For example, during the search, the LDI-E is able to compute the exact probability of a label path by using a restricted version of the forward-backward algorithm, also, the exact condition is different accordingly. Moreover, in this paper, we more focus on how to approximate the LDI inference with high performance.","The LDI-E produces y∗","while the LDI-A, the BHP and the BMP perform estimation on y∗",". We will compare them via experiments in Section 4."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we choose Bio-NER and NP-chunking tasks for experiments. First, we describe the implementations and settings.","We implemented DPLVMs by extending the HCRF library developed by Morency et al. (2007). We added a Limited-Memory BFGS optimizer (L-BFGS) (Nocedal and Wright, 1999), and reimplemented the code on training and inference for higher efficiency. To reduce overfitting, we employed a Gaussian prior (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999). We varied the the variance of the Gaussian prior (with values 10k",", k from -3 to 3), and we found that σ2","= 1.0 is optimal for DPLVMs on the development data, and used it throughout the experiments in this section. 775","The training stage was kept the same as Morency et al. (2007). In other words, there is no need to change the conventional parameter estimation method on DPLVM models for adapting the various inference algorithms in this paper. For more information on training DPLVMs, refer to Morency et al. (2007) and Petrov and Klein (2008).","Since the CRF model is one of the most successful models in sequential labeling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003), in this paper, we choosed CRFs as a baseline model for the comparison. Note that the feature sets were kept the same in DPLVMs and CRFs. Also, the optimizer and fine tuning strategy were kept the same.","4.1 BioNLP/NLPBA-2004 Shared Task (Bio-NER) Our first experiment used the data from the BioNLP/NLPBA-2004 shared task. It is a biomedical named-entity recognition task on the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2004). Named entity recognition aims to identify and classify technical terms in a given domain (here, molecular biology) that refer to concepts of interest to domain experts. The training set consists of 2,000 abstracts from MEDLINE; and the evaluation set consists of 404 abstracts from MEDLINE. We divided the original training set into 1,800 abstracts for the training data and 200 abstracts for the development data.","The task adopts the BIO encoding scheme, i.e., B-x for words beginning an entity x, I-x for words continuing an entity x, and O for words being outside of all entities. The Bio-NER task contains 5 different named entities with 11 BIO encoding labels.","The standard evaluation metrics for this task are precision p (the fraction of output entities match-ing the reference entities), recall r (the fraction of reference entities returned), and the F-measure given by F = 2pr/(p + r).","Following Okanohara et al. (2006), we used word features, POS features and orthography features (prefix, postfix, uppercase/lowercase, etc.), as listed in Table 1. However, their globally dependent features, like preceding-entity features, were not used in our system. Also, to speed up the training, features that appeared rarely in the training data were removed. For DPLVM models, we tuned the number of latent variables per label from 2 to 5 on preliminary experiments, and used the Word Features: {wi−2, wi−1, wi, wi+1, wi+2, wi−1wi, wiwi+1} ×{hi, hi−1hi} POS Features: {ti−2, ti−1, ti, ti+1, ti+2, ti−2ti−1, ti−1ti, titi+1, ti+1ti+2, ti−2ti−1ti, ti−1titi+1, titi+1ti+2} ×{hi, hi−1hi} Orth.

No globally dependent features were used; also, no external resources were used.

First, on the development data, the value of n (the search step, see Figure 3 for its definition) was varied in the LDI inference; the corresponding F-measure, exactitude (the fraction of sentences that achieved the exact condition, Eq. 6), #latent-path (number of latent paths that have been searched), and inference-time were measured. Second, the n tuned on the development data was employed for the LDI on the test data, and experimental comparisons with the existing inference methods, the BHP and the BMP, were made. 4.2 NP-Chunking Task On the Bio-NER task, we have studied the LDI on a relatively rich feature-set, including word features, POS features and orthographic features.

For example, in POS-tagging task and Chinese/Japanese word segmentation task, there are only word features available. For this reason, it is necessary to check the performance of the LDI on poor feature-set. We chose another popular task, the NP-chunking, for this study. Here, we used only poor feature-set, i.e., feature templates that depend only on words (see Table 2 for details), taking into account 200K features. No external resources were used.","The NP-chunking data was extracted from the training/test data of the CoNLL-2000 shallow-parsing shared task (Sang and Buchholz, 2000). In this task, the non-recursive cores of noun phrases called base NPs are identified. The training set consists of 8,936 sentences, and the test set consists of 2,012 sentences.

When n = 30, the F-measure has already reached its plateau, with the exactitude of 83.0%, and the inference time of 80 seconds.

Further growth of n after the beginning point of the plateau in-creases the inference time linearly (roughly), but achieved only very marginal improvement on F-measure. This suggests that the LDI inference can be approximated aggressively by stopping the inference within a small number of search steps, n. This can achieve high efficiency, without an obvious degradation on the performance.","Table 3 shows the experimental comparisons among the LDI-Approximation, the LDI-Exact (here, exact means the n is big enough, e.g., n = 10K), the BMP, and the BHP on DPLVM mod-777 Models S.A.

Finally, the label path with the highest value, combining scores and confidences, will be the optimal result. For more details of the MBR technique, refer to Goel & Byrne (2000) and Kumar & Byrne (2002).","An advantage of the LDI over the BHP and the BMP is that the LDI can efficiently produce the probabilities of the label sequences in LPn. Such probabilities can be used directly for performing the MBR reranking. We will show that it is easy to employ the MBR reranking for the LDI, because the necessary statistics (e.g., the probabilities of the label paths, y1, y2, . . . yn) are already produced. In other words, by using LDI inference, a set of possible label sequences has been collected with associated probabilities. Although the cardinality of the set may be small, it accounts for most of the probability mass by the definition of the LDI. Eq.13 can be directly applied on this set to perform reranking.","In contrast, the BHP and the BMP inference are unable to provide such information for the reranking. For this reason, we can only report the results of the reranking for the LDI.","As can be seen in Table 5, MBR-reranking improved the performance of the LDI on the NP-chunking task with a poor feature set. The presented MBR reranking algorithm is a general solution for various evaluation criterions. We can see that the different evaluation criterion, EVAL, shares the common framework in Eq. 13. In practice, it is only necessary to re-implement the component of fEVAL(y, y′",") for a different evaluation criterion. In this paper, the evaluation criterion is the F-measure."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose an inference method, the LDI, which is able to decode the optimal label sequence on latent conditional models.

It demonstrates encouraging improvement on the NP-chunking tasks. In the future, we plan to perform further experiments to make a more detailed study on combining the LDI inference and the MBR reranking.","The LDI inference algorithm is not necessarily limited in linear-chain structure. It could be extended to other latent conditional models with tree structure (e.g., syntactic parsing with latent variables), as long as it allows efficient combination of search and dynamic-programming. This could also be a future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Xia Zhou, Yusuke Miyao, Takuya Matsuzaki, Naoaki Okazaki and Galen Andrew for enlightening discussions, as well as the anonymous reviewers who gave very helpful comments.
