We present here a means of bootstrapping finely-discriminating taxonomies from a variety of different starting points, or seeds, that are acquired from three different sources: WordNet, ConceptNet and the web at large."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Taxonomies provide a natural and intuitive means of organizing information, from the biological taxonomies of the Linnaean system to the layout of supermarkets and bookstores to the organizational structure of companies. Taxonomies also provide the structural backbone for ontologies in computer science, from common-sense ontologies like Cyc (Lenat and Guha, 1990) and SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) to lexical ontologies like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990). Each of these uses is based on the same root-branch-leaf metaphor: the broadest terms with the widest scope occupy the highest positions of a taxonomy, near the root, while specific terms with the most local concerns are located lower in the hierarchy, nearest the leaves. The more interior nodes that a taxonomy possesses, the finer the conceptual distinctions and the more gradated the similarity judgments it can make (e.g., Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).","General-purpose computational taxonomies are called upon to perform both coarse-grained and fine-grained judgments. In NLP, for in-stance, the semantics of “eat” requires just enough knowledge to discriminate foods like tofu and cheese from non-foods like wool and steel, while specific applications in the domain of cooking and recipes (e.g., Hammond’s (1986) CHEF) require enough discrimination to know that tofu can be replaced with clotted cheese in many recipes because each is a soft, white and bland food.","So while much depends on the domain of us-age, it remains an open question as to how many nodes a good taxonomy should possess. Princeton WordNet, for instance, strives for as many nodes as there are word senses in English, yet it also contains a substantial number of composite nodes that are lexicalized not as single words, but as complex phrases. Print dictionaries intended for human consumption aim for some economy of structure, and typically do not include the meaning of phrases that can be understood as straightforward compositions of the meaning of their parts (Hanks, 2004). But WordNet also serves another purpose, as a lexical knowledge-base for computers, not humans, a context in which concerns about space seem quaint. When space is not a issue, there seems no good reason to exclude nodes from a concept taxonomy merely for being composites of other ideas; the real test of entry is whether a given node adds value to a taxonomy, by increasing its level of internal organization through the systematic dissection of overly broad categories into finer, more intuitive and manageable clusters.","In this paper we describe a means by which finely-discriminating taxonomies can be grown from a variety of different knowledge seeds. These taxonomies comprise composite categories that can be lexicalized as phrases of the form “ADJ NOUN”, such as Sharp-Instrument, which represents the set of all instruments that are typically considered sharp, such as knives, scissors, chisels and can-openers. While WordNet already contains an equivalent category, named Edge-835 Tool, which it defines with the gloss “any cutting tool with a sharp cutting edge”, it provides no structural basis for inferring that any member of this category can be considered sharp. For the most part, if two ideas (word senses) belong to the same semantic category X in WordNet, the most we can infer is that both possess the trivial property X-ness. Our goal here is to construct taxonomies whose form makes explicit the actual properties that accrue from membership in a category.","Past work on related approaches to taxonomy creation are discussed in section 2, while section 3 describes the different knowledge seeds that serve as the starting point for our bootstrapping process. In section 4 we describe the bootstrapping process in more detail; such processes are prone to noise, so we also discuss how the acquired categorizations are validated and filtered after each bootstrapping cycle. An evaluation of the key ideas is then presented in section 5, to determine which seed yields the highest quality taxonomy once bootstrapping is completed. The paper then concludes with some final remarks in section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Simple pattern-matching techniques can be surprisingly effective for the extraction of lexico-semantic relations from text when those relations are expressed using relatively stable and unambiguous syntagmatic patterns (Ahlswede and Evens, 1988). For instance, the work of Hearst (1992) typifies this surgical approach to relation extraction, in which a system fishes in a large text for particular word sequences that strongly suggest a semantic relationship such as hypernymy or, in the case of Charniak and Berland (1999), the part-whole relation. Such efforts offer high precision but can exhibit low recall on moderate-sized corpora, and extract just a tiny (but very useful) subset of the semantic content of a text. The KnowItAll system of Etzioni et al. (2004) employs the same generic patterns as Hearst (e.g., “NPs such as NP1, NP2, ...”), and more besides, to extract a whole range of facts that can be exploited for web-based question-an-swering. Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007) also use a range of Hearst-like patterns to find text sequences in web-text that are indicative of the lexico-semantic properties of words; in particular, these authors use phrases like “to * a new NOUN” and “the purpose of NOUN is to *” to identify the formal (isa), agentive (made by) and telic (used for) roles of nouns.","Snow, Jurafsky and Ng (2004) use supervised learning techniques to acquire those syntagmatic patterns that prove most useful for extracting hypernym relations from text. They train their system using pairs of WordNet terms that exemplify the hypernym relation; these are used to identify specific sentences in corpora that are most likely to express the relation in lexical terms. A binary classifier is then trained on lexico-syntactic features that are extracted from a dependency-structure parse of these sentences. Kashyap et al., (2005) experiment with a bootstrapping approach to growing concept taxonomies in the medical domain. A gold standard taxonomy provides terms that are used to retrieve documents which are then hierarchically clustered; cohesiveness measures are used to yield a taxonomy of terms that can then further drive the retrieval and clustering cycle. Kozareva et al. (2008) use a bootstrapping approach that extends the fixed-pattern approach of Hearst (1992) in two intriguing ways. First, they use a doubly-anchored retrieval pattern of the form “NOUNcat such as NOUNexample and *” to ground the retrieval relative to a known example of hypernymy, so that any values extracted for the wildcard * are likely to be coordinate terms of NOUNexample and even more likely to be good examples of NOUNcat. Secondly, they construct a graph of terms that co-occur within this pattern to determine which terms are supported by others, and by how much. These authors also use two kinds of bootstrapping: the first variation, dubbed reckless, uses the candidates extracted from the double-anchored pattern (via *) as exemplars (NOUNexample) for successive retrieval cycles; the second variation first checks whether a candidate is sufficiently supported to be used as an exemplar in future retrieval cycles.","The approach we describe here is most similar to that of Kozareva et al. (2008). We too use a double-anchored pattern, but place the anchors in different places to obtain the query patterns “ADJcat NOUNcat such as *” and “ADJcat * such as NOUNexample”. As a result, we obtain a finely-discriminating taxonomy based on categories that are explicitly annotated with the properties (ADJcat) that they bequeath to their members. These categories have an obvious descriptive and organizational utility, but of a kind that one is unlikely to find in conventional resources like WordNet and Wikipedia. Kozareva et al. (2008) test their approach on relatively simple and objective categories like states, countries (both 836 closed sets), singers and fish (both open, the former more so than the latter), but not on complex categories in which members are tied both to a general category, like food, and to a stereotypical property, like sweet (Veale and Hao, 2007). By validating membership in these complex categories using WordNet-based heuristics, we can hang these categories and members on specific WordNet senses, and thus enrich WordNet with this additional taxonomic structure."]},{"title":"3 Seeds for Taxonomic Growth","paragraphs":["A fine-grained taxonomy can be viewed as a set of triples Tijk = <Ci, Dj, Pk>, where Ci","denotes a child of the parent term Pk that possesses the discriminating property Dj; in effect, each such triple expresses that Ci is a specialization of the complex taxonym Dj-Pk. Thus, the belief that cola is a carbonated-drink is expressed by the triple <cola, carbonated, drink>. From this triple we can identify other categorizations of cola (such as treat and refreshment) via the web query “carbonated * such as cola”, or we can identify other similarly fizzy drinks via the query “carbonated drinks such as *”. So this web-based bootstrapping of fine-grained category hierarchies requires that we already possess a collection of fine-grained distinctions of a relatively high-quality. We now consider three different starting points for this bootstrapping process, as extracted from three different resources: WordNet, ConceptNet and the web at large. 3.1 WordNet The noun-sense taxonomy of WordNet makes a number of fine-grained distinctions that prove useful in clustering entities into smaller and more natural groupings. For instance, WordNet differentiates {feline, felid} into the sub-categories {true_cat, cat} and {big_cat, cat}, the former serving to group domesticated cats with other cats of a similar size, the latter serving to cluster cats that are larger, wilder and more exotic. However, such fine-grained distinctions are the exception rather than the norm in WordNet, and not one of the 60+ words of the form Xess in WordNet that denote a person (such as huntress, waitress, Jewess, etc.) express the defining property female in explicit taxonomic terms. Nonetheless, the free-text glosses associated with WordNet sense-entries often do state the kind of distinctions we would wish to find expressed as explicit taxonyms. A shallow parse of these glosses thus yields a sizable number of fine-grained distinctions, such as <lioness, female, lion>, <espresso, strong, coffee> and both <messiah, awaited, king> and <messiah, expected, deliverer>. 3.2 ConceptNet Despite its taxonomic organization, WordNet owes much to the centralized and authority-pre-serving craft of traditional lexicography. ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004), in contrast, is a far less authoritative knowledge-source, one that owes more to the workings of the WWW than to conventional print dictionaries. Comprising factoids culled from the template-structured contributions of thousands of web users, ConceptNet expresses many relationships that accurately reflect a public, common-sense view on a given topic (from vampires to dentists) and many more that are simply bizarre or ill-formed. Looking to the relation that interests us here, the IsA relation, ConceptNet tells us that an espresso is a strong coffee (correctly, like WordNet) but that a bagel is a Jewish word (confusing use with mention). Likewise, we find that expressionism is an artistic style (correct, though WordNet deems it an artistic movement) but that an explosion is a suicide attack (confusing formal and telic roles). Since we cannot trust the content of ConceptNet directly, lest we bootstrap from a highly unreliable starting point, we use WordNet as a simple filter. While the concise form of ConceptNet contains over 30,000 IsA propositions, we consider as our seed collection only those that define a noun concept (such as “espresso”) in terms of a binary compound (e.g., “strong coffee”) where the head of the latter (e.g., “coffee”) denotes a WordNet hypernym of some sense of the former. This yields triples such as <Wyoming, great, state>, <wreck, serious, accident> and <wolf, wild, animal>. 3.3 Web-derived Stereotypes Veale and Hao (2007) also use the observations of web-users to acquire common perceptions of oft-mentioned ideas, but do so by harvesting simile expressions of the form “as ADJ as a NOUN” directly from the web. Their approach hinges on the fact that similes exploit stereotypes to draw out the salient properties of a target, thereby al-lowing rich descriptions of those stereotypes to be easily acquired, e.g., that snowflakes are pure and unique, acrobats are agile and nimble, knifes are sharp and dangerous, viruses are malicious and infectious, and so on. However, because they find that almost 15% of their web-harvested sim-837 iles are ironic (e.g., “as subtle as a rock”, “as bulletproof as a sponge-cake”, etc.), they filter irony from these associations by hand, to yield a sizable database of stereotypical attributions that describes over 6000 noun concepts in terms of over 2000 adjectival properties. However, because Veale and Hao’s data directly maps stereotypical properties to simile vehicles, it does not provide a parent category for these vehicles. Thus, the seed triples derived from this data are only partially instantiated; for instance, we obtain <surgeon, skilful, ?>, <virus, malicious, ?> and <dog, loyal, ?>. This does not prove to be a serious impediment, however, as the missing field of each triple is quickly identified during the first cycle of bootstrapping. 3.4 Overview of Seed Resources Neither of these three seeds is an entirely useful knowledge-base in its own right. The WordNet-based seed is clearly a representation of convenience, since it contains only those properties that can be acquired from the glosses that happen to be amenable to a simple shallow-parse. The ConceptNet seed is likewise a small collection of low-hanging fruit, made smaller still by the use of WordNet as a coarse but very necessary noise-filter. And while the simile-derived distinctions obtained from Veale and Hao paint a richly detailed picture of the most frequent objects of comparison, this seed offers no coverage for the majority of concepts that are insufficiently note-worthy to be found in web similes. A quantitative comparison of all three seeds is provided in Table 1 below. WordNet ConceptNet Simile # terms in total 12,227 1,133 6512 # triples in total 51,314 1808 16,688 # triples per term 4.12 1.6 2.56 # features 2305 550 1172","Table 1: The size of seed collections yielded from different sources. We can see that WordNet-derived seed is clearly the largest and apparently the most comprehensive knowledge-source of the three: it contains the most terms (concepts), the most features (discriminating properties of those concepts), and the most triples (which situate those concepts in parent categories that are further specialized by these discriminating features). But size is only weakly suggestive of quality, and as we shall see in the next section, even such dramatic differences in scale can disappear after several cycles of bootstrapping. In section 5 we will then consider which of these seeds yields the highest quality taxonomies after bootstrapping has been applied."]},{"title":"4 Bootstrapping from Seeds","paragraphs":["The seeds of the previous section each represent a different starting collection of triples. It is the goal of the bootstrapping process to grow these collections of triples, to capture more of the terms – and more of the distinctions – that a taxonomy is expected to know about. The expansion set of a triple Tijk = <Ci, Dj, Pk> is the set of triples that can be acquired from the web using the following query expansions (* is a search wildcard): 1. “Dj * such as Ci” 2. “Dj Pk such as *” In the first query, a noun is sought to yield another categorization of Ci, while in the second, other members of the fine-grained category Dj-Pk are sought to accompany Ci. In parsing the text snippets returned by these queries, we also exploit text sequences that match the following patterns: 3. “* and Dj Pk such as *” 4. “* and Dj * such as Ci” These last two patterns allow us to learn new discriminating features by noting how these discriminators are combined to reinforce each other in some ad-hoc category formulations. For in-stance, the phrase “cold and refreshing beverages such as lemonade” allows us to acquire the triples <lemonade, cold, beverage> and <lemonade, refreshing, beverage>. This pattern is necessary if the bootstrapping process is to expand be-yond the limited vocabulary of discriminating features (Dj) found in the original seed collections of triples.","We denote the mapping from a triple T to the set of additional triples that can be acquired from the web using the above queries/patterns as expand(T'). We currently implement this function using the Google search API. Our experiences with each query suggest that 200 snippets is a good search range for the first query, while 50 is usually more than adequate for the second. 838 We can now denote the knowledge that is acquired when starting from a given seed collection S after t cycles of bootstrapping as KtS",".

Unsurprisingly, the new triples acquired from the web via expand(T') are likely to be very noisy indeed. Following Kozareva et al. (2008), we can either in-dulge in reckless bootstrapping, which ignores the question of noise until all bootstrapping is finished, or we can apply a noise filter after each incremental step. The latter approach has the additional advantage of keeping the search-space as small as possible, which is a major consideration when bootstrapping from sizable seeds. We use a simple WordNet-based filter called near-miss: a new triple <Ci, Dj, Pk> is accepted if WordNet contains a sense of Ci that is a descendant of some sense of Pk (a hit), or a sense of Ci that is a descendant of the direct hypernym of some sense of Pk (a near-miss). This allows the bootstrapping process to acquire structures that are not simply a decorated version of the basic WordNet taxonomy, but to acquire hierarchical relations whose undifferentiated forms are not in WordNet (yet are largely compatible with WordNet).

The WordNet near-miss filter ensures that the large body of triples grown from each seed are broadly sound, and that we are not simply generating comparable quantities of nonsense in each case.

After a second cycle, we find it described as a sugary food, a fizzy drink and a dark mixer. After a third cycle, it is found to be a sensitive beverage, an everyday beverage and a common drink. After a fourth cycle, it is also found to be an irritating food and an unhealthy drink. After the fifth cycle, it is found to be a stimulating drink, a toxic food and a corrosive substance. In all, the single cola triple in the simile seed yields 14 triples after 1 cycle, 43 triples after 2 cycles, 72 after 3 cycles, 93 after 4 cycles, and 102 after 5 cycles.

To see whether the bootstrapping process is simply padding the seed taxonomy with large quantities of noise, or whether the acquired Dj values do indeed mark out the implicit essence of the Ci terms they describe, we need an evaluation framework that can quantify the ontological usefulness of these Dj values. For this, we use the experimental setup of Almuhareb and Poesio (2005), who use information extraction from the web to acquire attribute values for different terms/concepts, and who then compare the taxonomy that can be induced by clustering these values with the taxonomic backbone of WordNet.","Almuhareb and Poesio first created a balanced set of 402 nouns from 21 different semantic classes in WordNet. They then acquired attested attribute values for these nouns (such as hot for coffee, red for car, etc.) using the query \"(a|an| the) * Ci (is|was)\" to find corresponding Dj values for each Ci. Unlike our work, these authors did not seek to acquire hypernyms for each Ci during this search, and did not try to link the acquired attribute values to a particular branching point (Pk) in the taxonomy (they did, however, seek matching attributes for these values, such as Temperature for hot, but that aspect is not relevant here). They acquired 94,989 attribute values in all for the 402 test nouns. These values were then used as features of the corresponding nouns in a clustering experiment, using the CLUTO system of Karypis (2002). By using attribute values as a basis for partitioning the set of 402 nouns into 21 different categories, Almuhareb and Poesio attempted to reconstruct the original 21 WordNet categories from which the nouns were drawn. The more accurate the match to the original WordNet clustering, the more these attribute values can be seen (and used) as a representation of conceptual structure. In their first at-tempt, they achieved just a 56.7% clustering accuracy against the original human-assigned categories of WordNet. But after using a noise-filter to remove almost half of the web-harvested attribute values, they achieve a higher cluster accuracy of 62.7%. More specifically, Poesio and Almuhareb achieve a cluster purity of 0.627 and a cluster entropy of 0.338 using 51,345 features to describe and cluster the 402 nouns.1","We replicate the above experiments using the same 402 nouns, and assess the clustering accuracy (again using WordNet as a gold-standard) after each bootstrapping cycle. Recall that we use only the Dj fields of each triple as features for the clustering process, so the comparison with the WordNet gold-standard is still a fair one. Once again, the goal is to determine how much like the human-crafted WordNet taxonomy is the taxonomy that is clustered automatically from the discriminating words Dj only.

We express accuracy as a percentage; hence a purity of 0.627 is seen as an accuracy of 62.7%. 840 Poesio note that one third of their data-set has a low-frequency of between 5-100 occurrences in the British National Corpus. Looking to the coverage column of each table, we thus see that there are words in the Poesio and Almuhareb data set for which no triples can be acquired in 5 cycles of bootstrapping. Interestingly, though each seed is quite different in origin and size (see again Table 1), all reach similar levels of coverage (~82%) after 5 bootstrapping cycles. Test nouns for which all three seeds fail to reach a description include yesteryear, nonce (very rare), salient (more typically an adjective), jag, droop, fluting, fete, throb, poundage, stinging, rouble, rupee, riel, drachma, escudo, dinar, dirham, lira, dispensation, hoard, airstream (not typically a solid compound), riverside and curling. Figures 3 and 4 summarize the key findings in the above tables: while bootstrapping from all three seeds converges to the same level of coverage, the simile seed clearly produces the highest quality taxonomy.","Figure 3: Growth in the coverage from different seed sources.","Figure 4: Divergence in the clustering Purity","achieved using different seed sources.

However, the simile seed clearly yields the best accuracy of 84.3%, which also exceeds the accuracy of 66.4% achieved by Poesio and Almuhareb when using both values and attributes (such as Temperature, Color, etc.) for clustering, or the accuracy of 70.9% they achieve when using attributes alone. Furthermore, bootstrapping from the simile seed yields higher cluster accuracy on the 402-noun data-set than Veale and Hao (2008) themselves achieve with their simile data on the same test-set (69.85%).","But most striking of all is the concision of the representations that are acquired using bootstrapping. The simile seed yields a high cluster accuracy using a pool of just 2,614 fine discriminators, while Poesio and Almuhareb use 51,345 features even after their feature-set has been filtered for noise.

Nonetheless, quality wins out, and the simile-derived seed knowledge shows itself to be a clearly superior basis for reasoning about the structure and organization of conceptual categories. Bootstrapping from the simile seed yields a slightly smaller set of discriminating features than bootstrapping from the WordNet seed, one that is many times smaller than the Poesio and Almuhareb feature set. What matters is that they are the right features to discriminate with.","There appears to be a number of reasons for this significant difference in quality. For one, Veale and Hao (2007) show that similes express highly stereotypical beliefs that strongly influence the affective disposition of a term/concept; negatively perceived concepts are commonly used to exemplify negative properties in similes, while positively perceived concepts are widely used to exemplify positive properties. Veale and Hao (2008) go on to argue that similes offer a very concise snapshot of those widely-held beliefs that are the cornerstone of everyday reason-1 2 3 4 5 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 WordNet Simile ConceptNet Bootstrapping Cycle C o v e r a g e 1 2 3 4 5 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 WordNet Simile ConceptNet Poesio & Alm.

In addition, beliefs expressed via the “as Dj as Ci” form of similes appear to lend themselves to re-expression via the “Dj Pk such as Ci” form; in each case, a concept Ci is held up as an exemplar of a salient property Dj. Since the “such as” bootstrapping pattern seeks out expressions of prototypicality on the web, a simile-derived seed set is likely the best starting point for this search.","All three seeds appear to suffer the same coverage limitations, topping out at about 82% of the words in the Poesio and Almuhareb data-set. Indeed, after 5 bootstrapping cycles, all three seeds give rise to taxonomies that overlap on 328 words from the 402-noun test-set, accounting for 81.59% of the test-set. In effect then, bootstrapping stumbles over the same core of hard words in each case, no matter the seed that is used. As such, the problem of coverage lies not in the seed collection, but in the queries used to perform the bootstrapping. The same coverage limitations will thus apply to other bootstrapping approaches to knowledge acquisition, such as Kozareva et al. (2008), which rely on much the same stock patterns. So while bootstrapping may not be a general solution for acquiring all aspects of a general-purpose taxonomy, it is clearly useful in acquiring large swathes of such a taxonomy if given a sufficiently high-quality seed to start from."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ahlswede, T. and Evans, M.
