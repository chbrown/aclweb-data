We show that our approach is highly effective on 6 different comparable corpora between English and 4 languages from 3 different language families. Furthermore, it performs substantially better than a state-of-the-art competitor."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Named Entities (NEs) play a critical role in many Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an even more important role as the accuracy of their transliterations is shown to correlate highly with the performance of the CLIR systems (Mandl and Womser-Hacker, 2005, Xu and Weischedel, 2005). Traditional methods for transliterations have not proven to be very effective in CLIR. Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) usually produce incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are too static to have good coverage of NEs1","occurring in the current news events. Hence, there is a critical need for creating and continually updat-  * Currently with University of Utah. 1 New NEs are introduced to the vocabulary of a language every day.

News stories are typically rich in NEs and there-fore, comparable news corpora can be expected to contain NETEs (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al., 2006). The large quantity and the perpetual availability of news corpora in many of the world’s languages, make mining of NETEs a viable alternative to traditional approaches. It is this opportunity that we address in our work. In this paper, we detail an effective and scalable mining method, called MINT (MIning Named-entity Transliteration equivalents), for mining of NETEs from large comparable corpora. MINT addresses several challenges in mining NETEs from large comparable corpora: exhaustiveness (in mining sparse NETEs), computational efficiency (in scaling on corpora size), language independence (in being applicable to many language pairs) and linguistic frugality (in requiring minimal external linguistic resources).","Our contributions are as follows:"," We give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that news articles in different languages with reasonably similar content are rich sources of NETEs (Udupa, et al., 2008)."," We demonstrate that the above insight can be translated into an effective approach for mining NETEs from large comparable corpora even when similar articles are not known a priori."," We demonstrate MINT’s effectiveness on 4 language pairs involving 5 languages (English, Hindi, Kannada, Russian, and Tamil) from 3 different language families, and its scalability on corpora of vastly different sizes (2,000 to 200,000 articles)."," We show that MINT’s performance is significantly better than a state of the art method (Klementiev and Roth, 2006)."," 799","We discuss the motivation behind our approach in Section 2 and present the details in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe the evalua-tion process and in Section 5, we present the results and analysis. We discuss related work in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["MINT is based on the hypothesis that news articles in different languages with similar content contain highly overlapping set of NEs. News articles are typically rich in NEs as news is about events involving people, locations, organizations, etc2",". It is reasonable to expect that multilingual news articles reporting the same news event mention the same NEs in the respective languages. For instance, consider the English and Hindi news reports from the New York Times and the BBC on the second oath taking of President Barack Obama (Figure 1). The articles are not parallel but discuss the same event. Naturally, they mention the same NEs (such as Barack Obama, John Roberts, White House) in the respective languages, and hence, are rich sources of NETEs.","Our empirical investigation of comparable corpora confirmed the above insight. A study of  2 News articles from the BBC corpus had, on an average, 12.9 NEs and new articles from the The New Indian Express, about 11.8 NEs.  200 pairs of similar news articles published by The New Indian Express in 2007 in English and Tamil showed that 87% of the single word NEs in the English articles had at least one transliteration equivalent in the conjugate Tamil articles. The MINT method leverages this empirically backed insight to mine NETEs from such comparable corpora.","However, there are several challenges to the mining process: firstly, vast majority of the NEs in comparable corpora are very sparse; our analysis showed that 80% of the NEs in The New Indian Express news corpora appear less than 5 times in the entire corpora. Hence, any mining method that depends mainly on repeated occurrences of the NEs in the corpora is likely to miss vast majority of the NETEs. Secondly, the mining method must restrict the candidate NETEs that need to be examined for match to a reasonably small number, not only to minimize false positives but also to be computationally efficient. Thirdly, the use of linguistic tools and resources must be kept to a minimum as resources are available only in a handful of languages. Finally, it is important to use as little language-specific knowledge as possible in order to make the mining method applicable across a vast majority of languages of the world. The MINT method proposed in this paper addresses all the above is-sues."," 800"]},{"title":"3 The MINT Mining Method","paragraphs":["MINT has two stages. In the first stage, for every document in the source language side, the set of documents in the target language side with similar news content are found using a cross-language document similarity model. In the second stage, the NEs in the source language side are extracted using a Named Entity Recognizer (NER) and, subsequently, for each NE in a source language document, its transliterations are mined from the corresponding target language documents. We present the details of the two stages of MINT in the remainder of this section. 3.1 Finding Similar Document Pairs The first stage of MINT method (Figure 2) works on the documents from the comparable corpora (CS, CT) in languages S and T and produces a collection AS,T of similar article pairs (DS, DT). Each article pair (DS, DT) in AS,T consists of an article (DS) in language S and an article (DT) in language T, that have similar content. The cross-language similarity between DS and DT, as measured by the cross-language similarity model MD, is at least  > 0.

Real Environment (REAL): Given large","comparable corpora (CS, CT), how effective is","MINT, end-to-end?","","The IDEAL environment is indeed ideal for MINT since every article in the comparable corpora is paired with exactly one similar article in the other language and the pairing of articles in the comparable corpora is known in advance. We want to emphasize here that such corpora are indeed available in many domains such as technical documents and interlinked multilingual Wikipedia articles. In the IDEAL environment, only Stage 2 of MINT is put to test, as article alignments are given.","In the NEAR-IDEAL data environment, every article in the comparable corpora is known to have exactly one conjugate article in the other language though the pairing itself is not known in advance. In such a setting, MINT needs to discover the article pairing before mining NETEs and therefore, both stages of MINT are put to test. The best performance possible in this environment should ideally be the same as that of IDEAL, and any degradation points to the shortcoming of the Stage 1 of MINT. These two environments quantify the stage-wise performance of the MINT method.","Finally, in the data environment REAL, we test MINT on large comparable corpora, where even the existence of a conjugate article in the target side for a given article in the source side of the comparable corpora is not guaranteed, as in 802 any normal large multilingual news corpora. In this scenario both the stages of MINT are put to test. This is the toughest, and perhaps the typical setting in which MINT would be used. 4.1 Comparable Corpora In our experiments, the source language is English whereas the 4 target languages are from three different language families (Hindi from the Indo-Aryan family, Russian from the Slavic family, Kannada and Tamil from the Dravidian family). Note that none of the five languages use a common script and hence identification of cognates, spelling variations, suffix transformations, and other techniques commonly used for closely related languages that have a common script are not applicable for mining NETEs. Table 1 summarizes the 6 different comparable corpora that were used for the empirical investigation; 4 for the IDEAL and NEAR-IDEAL environments (in 4 language pairs), and 2 for the REAL environment (in 2 language pairs).

Corpora in group S are relatively small in size, and contain pairs of articles that have been judged by human annotators as similar. Corpora in group L are two orders of magnitude larger in size than those in group S and contain a large number of articles that may not have conjugates in the target side. In addition the pairings are unknown even for the articles that have conjugates. All comparable corpora had publication dates, except EH-S, which is known to have been published over the same year.","The EK-S, ET-S, EK-L and ET-L corpora are from The New Indian Express news paper, whereas the EH-S corpora are from Web Dunia and the ER-S corpora are from BBC/Lenta News Agency respectively. 4.2 Cross-language Similarity Model The cross-language document similarity model requires a bilingual dictionary in the appropriate language pair. Therefore, we generated statistical dictionaries for 3 language pairs (from parallel corpora of the following sizes: 11K sentence pairs in English-Kannada, 54K in English-Hindi, and 14K in English-Tamil) using the GIZA++ statistical alignment tool ","(Och et al., 2003), with 5 iterations each of IBM Model 1 and HMM. We did not have access to an English-Russian parallel corpus and hence could not generate a dictionary for this language pair. Hence, the NEAR-IDEAL experiments were not run for the English-Russian language pair.","Although the coverage of the dictionaries was low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for our cross-language document similarity model as it might have for topic based CLIR (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998). Unlike CLIR, where the query is typically smaller in length compared to the documents, in our case we are dealing with news articles of comparable size in both source and target languages.","When many translations were available for a source word, we considered only the top-4 translations. Further, we smoothed the document probability distributions with collection frequency as described in (Ponte and Croft, 1998). 4.3 Transliteration Similarity Model The transliteration similarity models for each of the 4 language pairs were produced by learning over a training corpus consisting of about 16,000 single word NETEs, in each pair of languages. The training corpus in English-Hindi, English-Kannada and English-Tamil were hand-crafted by professionals, the English-Russian name pairs were culled from Wikipedia interwiki links and were cleaned heuristically. Equal number of negative samples was used for training the models. To produce the negative samples, we paired each source language NE with a random nonmatching target language NE. No language specific features were used and the same feature set was used in each of the 4 language pairs making MINT language neutral.","In all the experiments, our source side language is English, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005) was used to extract NEs from the source side article. It should be noted here that while the precision of the NER 803 used was consistently high, its recall was low, (~40%) especially in the New Indian Express corpus, perhaps due to the differences in the data used for training the NER and the data on which we used it. 4.4 Performance Measures Our intention is to measure the effectiveness of MINT by comparing its performance with the oracular (human annotator) performance. As transliteration equivalents must exist in the paired articles to be found by MINT, we focus only on those NEs that actually have at least one transliteration equivalent in the conjugate article.","Three performance measures are of interest to us: the fraction of distinct NEs from source language for which we found at least one transliteration in the target side (Recall on distinct NEs), the fraction of distinct NETEs (Recall on distinct NETEs) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of the NETEs mined. Since we are interested in mining not only the highly frequent but also the infrequent NETEs, recall metrics measure how effective our method is in mining NETEs exhaustively. The MRR score indicates how effective our method is in preferring the correct ones among candidates.","To measure the performance of MINT, we created a test bed for each of the language pairs. The test beds are summarized in Table 2.","The test beds consist of pairs of similar articles in each of the language pairs. It should be noted here that as transliteration equivalents must exist in the paired articles to be found by MINT, we focus only on those NEs that actually have at least one transliteration equivalent in the conjugate article."]},{"title":"5 Results & Analysis","paragraphs":["In this section, we present qualitative and quantitative performance of the MINT algorithm, in mining NETEs from comparable news corpora.

As in previous experiments, we ran our experiments on test beds described in Section 4.4.  Results in the NEAR-IDEAL Environment: There are two parts to this set of experiments. In the first part, we investigated the effectiveness of the cross-language document similarity model described in Section 3.1.

It is interesting to compare the results of MINT in NEAR-IDEAL data environment (Table 6) with MINT’s results in IDEAL environment (Table 4). The drop in MRR@1 is small: ~2% for EK-ST and ~3% for ET-ST. For EH-ST the drop is relatively more (~12%) as may be expected since the time window (3 days) could not be applied for this test bed. 5.3 REAL Environment The third set of experiments investigated the effectiveness of MINT on large comparable corpora. We ran the experiments on test beds created from group L corpora.  Test-beds for the REAL Environment: The test beds for the REAL environment (Table 7) consisted of only English articles since we do not know in advance whether these articles have any similar articles in the target languages.  Results in the REAL Environment: In real environment, we examined the top 2 articles of returned by Stage 1 of MINT, and mined NETEs from them. We used a date window of 3 in Stage 1. Table 8 summarizes the results for the REAL environment.  We observe that the performance of MINT is impressive, considering the fact that the comparable corpora used in the REAL environment is two orders of magnitude larger than those used in IDEAL and NEAR-IDEAL environments. This implies that MINT is able to effectively mine NETEs whenever the Stage 1 algorithm was able to find a good conjugate for each of the source language articles.","5.4 Generative Transliteration Similarity Model We employed the extended W-HMM transliteration similarity model in MINT and used it in the IDEAL data environment.

The limited coverage of dictionaries has been recognized as a problem in CLIR and MT (Demner-Fushman & Oard, 2002; Mandl & Womser-hacker, 2005; Xu &Weischedel, 2005).","In order to address this problem, different kinds of approaches have been taken, from learning transformation rules from dictionaries and applying the rules to find cross-lingual spelling variants (Pirkola et al., 2003), to learning translation lexicon from monolingual and/or comparable corpora (Fung, 1995; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1996). While these works have focused on finding translation equivalents of all class of words, we focus specifically on transliteration equivalents of NEs. (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; Quirk et al., 2007) addresses mining of parallel sentences and fragments from nearly parallel sentences. In contrast, our approach mines NETEs from article pairs that may not even have any parallel or nearly parallel sentences.","NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), and extended for NETE mining for several languages in (Saravanan and Kumaran, 2007). However, such methods miss vast majority of the NETEs due to their dependency on frequency signatures. In addition, (Klementiev and Roth, 2006) may not scale for large corpora, as they examine every word in the target side as a potential transliteration equivalent. NETE mining from comparable corpora using phonetic mappings was proposed in (Tao et al., 2006), but the need for language specific knowledge restricts its applicability across languages. We proposed the idea of mining NETEs from multilingual articles with similar content in (Udupa, et al., 2008). In this work, we extend the approach and provide a detailed description of the empirical studies."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we showed that MINT, a simple and intuitive technique employing cross-language document similarity and transliteration similarity models, is capable of mining NETEs effectively from large comparable news corpora. Our three stage empirical investigation showed that MINT performed close to optimal on comparable corpora consisting of pairs of similar articles when the pairings are known in advance. MINT induced fairly good pairings and performs exceedingly well even when the pairings are not known in advance. Further, MINT outperformed a state-of-the-art baseline and scaled to large comparable corpora. Finally, we demonstrated the language neutrality of MINT, by mining NETEs from 4 language pairs (between English and one of Russian, Hindi, Kannada or Tamil) from 3 vastly different linguistic families.","As a future work, we plan to use the extended W-HMM model to get features for the discriminative transliteration similarity model. We also want to use a combination of the cross-language document similarity score and the transliteration similarity score for scoring the NETEs. Finally, we would like to use the mined NETEs to improve the performance of the first stage of MINT."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Abhijit Bhole for his help and Chris","Quirk for valuable comments.
