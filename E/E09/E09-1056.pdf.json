However, current Machine Translation (MT) systems do not yet propose anything proactive upon tools which assist in managing terminological databases. In this work, we in-vestigate several enhancements to analogical learning and test our implementation on translating medical terms. We show that the analogical engine works equally well when translating from and into a morphologically rich language, or when deal-ing with language pairs written in different scripts. Combining it with a phrase-based statistical engine leads to significant improvements."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["If machine translation is to meet commercial needs, it must offer a sensible approach to translating terms. Currently, MT systems offer at best database management tools which allow a human (typically a translator, a terminologist or even the vendor of the system) to specify bilingual terminological entries. More advanced tools are meant to identify inconsistencies in terminological translations and might prove useful in controlled-language situations (Itagaki et al., 2007).","One approach to translate terms consists in using a domain-specific parallel corpus with standard alignment techniques (Brown et al., 1993) to mine new translations. Massive amounts of parallel data are certainly available in several pairs of languages for domains such as parliament debates or the like. However, having at our disposal a domain-specific (e.g. computer science) bitext with an adequate coverage is another issue. One might argue that domain-specific comparable (or perhaps unrelated) corpora are easier to acquire, in which case context-vector techniques (Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) can be used to identify the translation of terms. We certainly agree with that point of view to a certain extent, but as discussed by Morin et al. (2007), for many specific domains and pairs of languages, such resources simply do not exist. Furthermore, the task of translation identification is more difficult and error-prone.","Analogical learning has recently regained some interest in the NLP community. Lepage and Denoual (2005) proposed a machine translation system entirely based on the concept of formal analogy, that is, analogy on forms. Stroppa and Yvon (2005) applied analogical learning to several morphological tasks also involving analogies on words. Langlais and Patry (2007) applied it to the task of translating unknown words in several European languages, an idea investigated as well by Denoual (2007) for a Japanese to English translation task.","In this study, we improve the state-of-the-art of analogical learning by (i) proposing a simple yet effective implementation of an analogical solver; (ii) proposing an efficient solution to the search is-sue embedded in analogical learning, (iii) investigating whether a classifier can be trained to recognize bad candidates produced by analogical learning. We evaluate our analogical engine on the task of translating terms of the medical domain; a domain well-known for its tendency to create new words, many of which being complex lexical constructions. Our experiments involve five language pairs, including languages with very different morphological systems. 487","In the remainder of this paper, we first present in Section 2 the principle of analogical learning. Practical issues in analogical learning are discussed in Section 3 along with our solutions. In Section 4, we report on experiments we conducted with our analogical device. We conclude this study and discuss future work in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Analogical Learning 2.1 Definitions","paragraphs":["A proportional analogy, or analogy for short, is a relation between four items noted [x : y = z : t ] which reads as “ x is to y as z is to t ”. Among proportional analogies, we distinguish formal analogies, that is, those we can identify at a graphemic level, such as [adrenergic beta-agonists, adrenergic beta-antagonists, adrenergic alpha-agonists, adrenergic alpha-antagonists].","Formal analogies can be defined in terms of factorizations1",". Let x be a string over an alphabet Σ, a factorization of x, noted fx, is a sequence of n factors fx = (f 1","x, . . . , f n","x ), such that x = f 1","x ⊙ f 2","x ⊙ . . . ⊙ f n","x , where ⊙ denotes the concatenation operator. After (Stroppa and Yvon, 2005) we thus define a formal analogy as: Definition 1 ∀(x, y, z, t) ∈ Σ⋆4",", [x : y = z : t] iff there exist factorizations (fx, fy, fz, ft) ∈ (Σ⋆d )4","of (x, y, z, t) such that, ∀i ∈ [1, d], (f i y, f i","z) ∈","{","(f i","x, f i","t ), (f i","t , f i","x) } . The smallest d for which this","definition holds is called the degree of the analogy.","Intuitively, this definition states that (x, y, z, t) are made up of a common set of alternating sub-strings. It is routine to check that it captures the exemplar analogy introduced above, based on the following set of factorizations: fx ≡ (adrenergic bet, a-agonists) fy ≡ (adrenergic bet, a-antagonists) fz ≡ (adrenergic alph, a-agonists) ft ≡ (adrenergic alph, a-antagonists) As no smaller factorization can be found, the degree of this analogy is 2. In the sequel, we call an analogical equation an analogy where one item (usually the fourth) is missing and we note it [x : y = z : ? ].","1","Factorizations of strings correspond to segmentations. We keep the former term, to emphasize the genericity of the definition, which remains valid for other algebraic structures, for which factorization and segmentation are no longer synomymous. 2.2 Analogical Inference Let L = {(i, o) | i ∈ I, o ∈ O} be a learning set of observations, where I (O) is the set of possible forms of the input (output) linguistic system under study. We denote I(u) (O(u)) the projection of u into the input (output) space; that is, if u = (i, o), then I(u) ≡ i and O(u) ≡ o. For an incomplete observation u = (i, ?), the inference procedure is:","1. building EI (u) = {(x, y, z) ∈ L3","| [I(x) : I(y) = I(z) : I(u) ]}, the set of input triplets that define an analogy withI(u) .","2. building EO(u) = {o ∈ O | ∃(x, y, z) ∈ EI (u) s.t. [O(x) : O(y) = O(z) : o]} the set of solutions to the equations obtained by projecting the triplets of EI (u) into the output space.","3. selecting candidates among EO(u).","In the sequel, we distinguish the generator which implements the first two steps, from these-lector which implements step 3.","To give an example, assume L contains the following entries: (beeta-agonistit, adrenergic beta-agonists), (beetasalpaajat, adrenergic beta-antagonists) and (alfa-agonistit, adrenergic alpha-agonists). We might translate the Finnish term alfasalpaajat into the English term adrenergic alpha-antagonists by 1) identifying the input triplet: (beeta-agonistit, beetasalpaajat, alfa-agonistit) ; 2) projecting it into the equation [adrenergic beta-agonists : adrenergic betaantagonists = adrenergic alpha-agonists : ? ]; and solving it: adrenergic alpha-antagonists is one of its solutions.","During inference, analogies are recognized in-dependently in the input and the output space, and nothing pre-establishes which subpart of one input form corresponds to which subpart of the output one. This “knowledge” is passively captured thanks to the inductive bias of the learning strategy (an analogy in the input space corresponds to one in the output space). Also worth mentioning, this procedure does not rely on any pre-defined no-tion of word. This might come at an advantage for languages that are hard to segment (Lepage and Lardilleux, 2007)."]},{"title":"3 Practical issues","paragraphs":["Each step of analogical learning, that is, searching for input triplets, solving output equations and 488 selecting good candidates involves some practical issues. Since searching for input triplets might involve the need for solving (input) equations, we discuss the solver first. 3.1 The solver Lepage (1998) proposed an algorithm for solving an analogical equation [x : y = z : ? ]. An alignment between x and y and between x and z is first computed (by edit-distance) as illustrated in Figure 1. Then, the three strings are synchronized using x as a backbone of the synchronization. The algorithm can be seen as a deterministic finite-state machine where a state is defined by the two edit-operations being visited in the two tables. This is schematized by the two cursors in the figure. Two actions are allowed: copy one symbol from y or z into the solution and move one or both cursors. x: r e a d e r x: r e a d e r y: r e a d a b l e z: d o e r","△ △ Figure 1: Illustration of the synchronization done by the solver described in (Lepage, 1998).","There are two things to realize with this algorithm. First, since several (minimal-cost) alignments can be found between two strings, several synchronizations are typically carried out while solving an equation, leading to (possibly many) different solutions. Indeed, in adverse situations, an exponential number of synchronizations will have to be computed. Second, the algorithm fails to deliver an expected form in a rather frequent situation where two identical symbols align fortuitously in two strings. This is for instance the case in our running example where the symbol d in doer aligns to the one in reader, which puzzles the synchronization. Indeed, dabloe is the only form proposed to [reader : readable = doer : ? ], while the expected one is doable. The algorithm would have no problem, however, to produce the form writable out of the equation [reader : readable = writer : ? ].","Yvon et al. (2004) proposed an analogical solver which is not exposed to the latter problem. It consists in building a finite state transducer which generates the solutions to [x : y = z : ? ] while recognizing the form x. Theorem 1 t is a solution to [x : y = z : ?] iff t belongs to {y ◦ z}\\x.","shuffle and complement are two rational operations. The shuffle of two strings w and v, noted w ◦ v, is the regular language containing the strings obtained by selecting (with-out replacement) alternatively in w and v, sequences of characters in a left-to-right manner. For instance, spondyondontilalgiatis and ondspondonylaltitisgia are two strings belonging to spondylalgia ◦ ondontitis). The complementary set of w with respect to v, noted w\\v, is the set of strings formed by removing from w, in a left-to-right manner, the symbols in v. For instance, spondylitis and spydoniltis are belonging to spondyondontilalgiatis \\ ondontalgia. Our implementation of the two rational operations are sketched in Algorithm 1.","Because the shuffle of two strings may contain an exponential number of elements with respect to the length of those strings, building such an automaton may face combinatorial problems. Our solution simply consists in randomly sampling strings in the shuffle set. Our solver, depicted in Algorithm 2, is thus controlled by a sampling size s, the impact of which is illustrated in Table 1. By increasing s, the solver generates more (mostly spurious) solutions, but also increases the relative frequency with which the expected output is generated. In practice, provided a large enough sampling size,2","the expected form very often appears among the most frequent ones. s nb (solution,frequency) 10 11 (doable,7) (dabloe,3) (adbloe,3) 102","22 (doable,28) (dabloe,21) (abldoe,21) 103","29 (doable,333) (dabloe,196) (abldoe,164) Table 1: The 3-most frequent solutions generated by our solver, for different sampling sizes s, for the equation [reader : readable = doer : ? ]. nb indicates the number of (different) solutions generated. According to our definition, there are 32 distinct solutions to this equation. Note that our solver has no problem producing doable. 3.2 Searching for input triplets A brute-force approach to identifying the input triplets that define an analogy with the incomplete observation u = (t, ?) consists in enumerat-ing triplets in the input space and checking for an","2","We used s = 2 000 in this study. 489","function shuffle(y,z) Input: ⟨y, z⟩ two forms Output: a random word in y ◦ z if y = ε then","return z else","n ← rand(1,|y|)","return y[1:n] . shuffle( z,y[n+1:])","function complementary(m,x,r,s) Input: m ∈ y ◦ z, x Output: the set m \\ x if (m = ε) then","if (x = ε) then","s ← s ∪ r","else complementary(m[2:],x,r.m[1],s) if m[1] = x[1] then","complementary(m[2:],x[2:],r,s) Algorithm 1: Simulation of the two rational operations required by the solver. x[a:b] denotes the sequence of symbols x starting from index a to index b inclusive. x[a:] denotes the suffix of x starting at index a. analogical relation with t. This amounts to check o(|I|3",") analogies, which is manageable for toy problems only. Instead, Langlais and Patry (2007) proposed to solve analogical equations [y : x = t : ? ] for some pairs ⟨x, y⟩ belonging to the neighborhood3","of I(u), denoted N (t). Those solutions that belong to the input space are the z-forms retained;","EI (u) = { ⟨x, y, z⟩ : x ∈ N (t) , y ∈ N (x), z ∈ [y : x = t : ? ] ∩ I }","This strategy (hereafter named LP) directly follows from a symmetrical property of an analogy ([x : y = z : t ] ⇔ [y : x = t : z]), and reduces the search procedure to the resolution of a number of analogical equations which is quadratic with the number of pairs ⟨x, y⟩ sampled.","We found this strategy to be of little use for input spaces larger than a few tens of thousands forms. To solve this problem, we exploit a property on symbol counts that an analogical relation must fulfill (Lepage, 1998): [x : y = z : t ] ⇒ |x|c + |t|c = |y|c + |z|c ∀c ∈ A 3 The authors proposed to sample x and y among the clos-","est forms in terms of edit-distance to I(u).","function solver(⟨x, y, z⟩, s) Input: ⟨x, y, z⟩, a triplet, s the sampling size Output: a set of solutions to [x : y = z : ? ] sol ← φ for i ← 1 to s do","⟨a, b ⟩ ← odd(rand(0, 1))? ⟨z, y⟩ : ⟨y, z⟩","m ← shuffle(a,b )","c ← complementary(m,x,ε,{})","sol ← sol ∪ c return sol","Algorithm 2: A Stroppa&Yvon flavored solver.","rand(a, b) returns a random integer between a","and b (included).

This enforces a set of necessary constraints on the counts of characters that any two forms y and z must satisfy for [x : y = z : t ] to be true. By considering all forms x in turn,4","we collect a set of candidate triplets for t. A verification of those that define with t an analogy must then be carried out. For-mally, we built:","EI (u) = { ⟨x, y, z⟩ : x ∈ I, ⟨y, z⟩ ∈ C(⟨x, t ⟩), [x : y = z : t ] } where C(⟨x, t ⟩) denotes the set of pairs ⟨y, z⟩ which satisfy the count property.","This strategy will only work if (i) the number of quadruplets to check is much smaller than the number of triplets we can form in the input space (which happens to be the case in practice), and if (ii) we can efficiently identify the pairs ⟨y, z⟩ that satisfy a set of constraints on character counts. To this end, we proposed in (Langlais and Yvon, 2008) to organize the input space into a data structure which supports efficient runtime retrieval. 3.3 The selector Step 3 of analogical learning consists in selecting one or several solutions from the set of candidate forms produced by the generator. We trained in a supervised manner a binary classifier to distinguish good translation candidates (as defined by","4","Anagram forms do not have to be considered separately. 490 a reference) from spurious ones. We applied to this end the voted-perceptron algorithm described by Freund and Schapire (1999). Online votedperceptrons have been reported to work well in a number of NLP tasks (Collins, 2002; Liang et al., 2006). Training such a classifier is mainly a matter of feature engineering. An example e is a pair of source-target analogical relations (r, r̂) identified by the generator, and which elects t̂ as a translation for the term t: e ≡ (r, r̂) ≡ ([x : y = z : t], [x̂ : ŷ = ẑ : t̂]) where x̂, ŷ, and ẑ are respectively the projections of the source terms x, y and z. We investigated many features including (i) the degree of r and r̂, (ii) the frequency with which a form is generated,5 (iii) length ratios between t and t̂, (iv) likelihoods scores (min, max, avg.) computed by a character-based n-gram model trained on a large general corpus (without overlap to DEV or TRAIN), etc."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Calibrating the engine","paragraphs":["We compared the two aforementioned searching strategies on a task of identifying triplets in an input space of French words for 1 000 randomly selected test words. We considered input spaces of various sizes. The results are reported in Table 2. TC clearly outperforms LP by systematically identifying more triplets in much less time. For the largest input space of 84 000 forms, TC could identify an average of 746 triplets for 946 test words in 1.2 seconds, while the best compromise we could settle with LP allows the identification of 56 triplets on average for 889 words in 6.3 seconds on average. Note that in this experiment, LP was calibrated for each input space so that the best compromise between recall (%s) and speed could be found. Reducing the size of the neighborhood in LP improves computation time, but significantly affects recall. In the following, we only consider the TC search strategy. 4.2 Experimental Protocol Datasets The data we used in this study comes from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus.

The characteristics of this material are reported in Table 3. For the Finnish-English and Swedish-English language pairs, the ratio of uni-terms in the Foreign language (uf %) is twice the ratio of uni-terms in the English counterpart. This is simply due to the agglutinative nature of these two languages. For instance, according to MeSH, the English multi-term speech articulation tests corresponds to the Finnish uni-term ääntämiskokeet and to the Swedish one artikulationstester. The ratio of out-of-vocabulary forms (space-separated words unseen in TRAIN) in the TEST material is rather high: between 36% and 68% for all Foreign-to-English translation directions, but Finnish-to-English, where surprisingly, only 6% of the word forms are unknown.

Depending on the number of output translations k that one is willing to examine, a correct translation will be output for Nk input words. Precision at rank k is thus defined asPk = Nk/Nt. Recall is the proportion of the N input words for which a correct translation is output. Recall at rank k is defined asRk = Nk/N .","In all our experiments, candidate translations are sorted in decreasing order of frequency with which they were generated. 4.3 The generator The performances of the generator on the 10 translation sessions are reported in Table 4. The coverage of the generator varies between 38.5% (French-to-English) and 47.1% (English-to-Finnish), which is rather low. In most cases, the silence of the generator is due to a failure to identify analogies in the input space (step 1). The last column of Table 4 reports the maximum recall we can obtain if we consider all the candidates output by the generator. The relative accuracy of the generator, expressed by the ratio of R∞ to cov, ranges from 64.3% (English-French) to 79.1% (Spanish-to-English), for an average value of 73.8% over all translation directions. This roughly means that one fourth of the test terms with at least one solution do not contain the reference.","Overall, we conclude that analogical learning offers comparable performances for all translation directions, although some fluctuations are observed.

Clearly, for analogical learning to work efficiently, enough linguistic phenomena must be attested in the TRAIN material. To illustrate this, we collected for the Spanish-English language pair a set of medical terms from the Medical Drug Regulatory Activities thesaurus (MedDRA) which contains roughly three times more terms than the Spanish-English material used in this study. This extra material allows to raise the coverage to 73.4% (Spanish to English) and 79.7% (English to Spanish), an absolute improvement of more than 30%. 4.4 The selector We trained our classifiers on the several millions of examples generated while translating the development material.

We measure precision as the percentage of forms selected by the classifier that are sanctioned by the reference lexicon, and recall as the percentage of forms selected by the classifier over the to-tal number of sanctioned forms that the classifier could possibly select. (Recall that the generator often fails to produce oracle forms.)","The performance measured on the TEST material of the best classifier we monitored on DEV are reported in Table 5 for the Foreign-to-English translation directions (we made consistent observations on the reverse directions). For comparison purposes, we implemented a baseline classifier (lines argmax-f1) which selects the most-frequent candidate form. This is the selector used as a default in several studies on analogical learning (Lepage and Denoual, 2005; Stroppa and Yvon, 2005). The baseline identifies between 56.7% to 65.6% of the sanctioned forms, at precision rates ranging from 41.3% to 49.2%. We observe for all translation directions that the best classifier we trained systematically outperforms this baseline, both in terms of precision and recall. 4.4.1 The overall system Table 6 shows the overall performance of the analogical translation device in terms of precision, recall and coverage rates as defined in Section 4.2. Overall, our best configuration (the one embedding the s-best classifier) translates between 19.3% and 22.5% of the test material, with a precision ranging from 50.4% to 63.2%. This is better than the variant which always proposes the most frequent generated form (argmax-f1). Allowing more answers increases both precision and recall. If we allow up to 10 candidates per source term, the analogical translator translates one fourth of the terms (26.1%) with a precision of 70.9%, averaged over all translation directions. The oracle variant, which looks at the reference for selecting the good candidates produced by the generator, gives an upper bound of the performance that could be obtained with our approach: less than a third of the source terms can be translated correctly. Recall however that increasing the TRAIN material leads to drastic improvements in coverage. 4.5 Comparison with a PB-SMT engine To put these figures in perspective, we measured the performance of a phrase-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) engine trained to handle the same translation task. We trained a phrase table on TRAIN, using the standard approach.9","However, because of the small training size, and the rather huge OOV rate of the translation tasks we address, we did not train translation models on word-tokens, but at the character level. Therefore a phrase is indeed a sequence of characters. This idea has been successively investigated in a Catalan-to-Spanish translation task by Vilar et al. (2007). We tuned the 8 coefficients of the so-called log-linear combination maximized at decoding time on the first 200 pairs of terms of the DEV corpora. On the DEV set, BLEU scores10","range from 67.2 (English-to-Finnish) to 77.0 (Russian-to-English).","Table 7 reports the precision and recall of both translation engines. Note that because the SMT engine always propose a translation, its precision equals its recall. First, we observe that the precision of the SMT engine is not high (between 17% and 31%), which demonstrates the difficulty of the task. The analogical device does better for all translation directions (see Table 6), but at a much lower recall, remaining silent more than half of the time. This suggests that combining both systems could be advantageous. To verify this, we ran a straightforward combination: whenever the analogical device produces a translation, we pick it; otherwise, the statistical output is considered. The gains of the resulting system over the SMT alone are reported in column ∆B.

For instance, the Spanish term instituciones de atención ambulatoria is translated word for word by Pharaoh into institutions, atention ambulatory while analogical learning produces ambulatory care facilities. We also noticed that analogical learning sometimes produces wrong translations based on morphological regularities that are applied blindly. This is, for instance, the case in a Russian/English example where mouthal manifestations is produced, in-stead of oral manifestations."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and future work","paragraphs":["In this study, we proposed solutions to practical issues involved in analogical learning. A simple yet effective implementation of a solver is described. A search strategy is proposed which outperforms the one described in (Langlais and Patry, 2007). Also, we showed that a classifier trained to select good candidate translations outperforms the most-frequently-generated heuristic used in several works on analogical learning.","Our analogical device was used to translate medical terms in different language pairs. The approach rates comparably across the 10 translation directions we considered. In particular, we do not see a drop in performance when translating into a morphology rich language (such as Finnish), or when translating into languages with different scripts. Averaged over all translation directions, the best variant could translate in first position 21% of the terms with a precision of 57%, while at best, one could translate 30% of the terms with a perfect precision. We show that the analogical translations are of better quality than those produced by a phrase-based engine trained at the character level, albeit with much lower recall. A straightforward combination of both approaches led an improvement of 5.3 BLEU points over the SMT alone. Better SMT performance could be obtained with a system based on morphemes, see for instance (Toutanova et al., 2008). However, since lists of morphemes specific to the medical domain do not exist for all the languages pairs we considered here, unsupervised methods for acquir-ing morphemes would be necessary, which is left as a future work. In any case, this comparison is meaningful, since both the SMT and the analogical device work at the character level.","This work opens up several avenues. First, we will test our approach on terminologies from different domains, varying the size of the training material. Second, analyzing the segmentation in-duced by analogical learning would be interesting. Third, we need to address the problem of combining the translations produced by analogy into a front-end statistical translation engine. Last, there is no reason to constrain ourselves to translating terminology only. We targeted this task in the first place, because terminology typically plugs translation systems, but we think that analogical learning could be useful for translating infrequent entities. 494"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P.
