The rules underlying these phenomena appear to be remarkably similar. Thus, the software module ELLEIPO, which was originally developed to generate clausal coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch, works for Estonian as well. In order to extend ELLEIPO’s coverage to Estonian, we only had to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination. We describe the language-independent rules for coordinate ellipsis that ELLEIPO applies to non-elliptical syntactic structures in both target languages."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In written German newspaper text, clausal coordination occurs in about 14% of the sentences, and coordinate ellipsis (e.g. (1)) in about 7% (see a corpus study by Harbusch and Kempen, 2007). Studies of ellipsis in Estonian are hardly available (cf. Erelt, 2003). (1) Monopole sollen geknackt werden und Monopolies should shattered be and Märkte sollen getrennt werden markets should split be 'Monopolies should be shattered and markets split’","In order to deal with these relatively frequent phenomena, we develop an Estonian coordinate-ellipsis generator based on ELLEIPO, the software module written in JAVA that generates clausal coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch (Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). Given the fact that the two target languages belong to two rather different language families (German is an Indo-European, Estonian a Finno-Ugric language) we expected the two target languages to differ considerably with respect to the rules for generating coordinate elisions; however, this expectation was falsified. As we will detail below, a pairwise comparison of a heterogeneous set of elliptical constructions in the target languages reveals that the German rules we had implemented in ELLEIPO also generate the Estonian structures. We only needed to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination. The core algorithm worked language-independently for both languages.","The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we first define the four main groups of clausal coordinate ellipsis phenomena, and show that the elisions in the two target languages obey basically the same rules. This implies that the Estonian version of the software system ELLEIPO can use the same core algorithm as the German and Dutch version. In section 3, we discuss other linguistic theories for clausal coordinate ellipsis, especially focussing on implementations for generation. In final section 4, we draw some conclusions and address options for future work."]},{"title":"2 Clause-level coordinate ellipsis in Estonian and German","paragraphs":["In the literature, one often distinguishes four major types of clause-level coordinate ellipsis (which can become combined; cf. example (1)). 1"," • GAPPING, with three special variants called","LONG DISTANCE GAPPING (LDG), SUB-","GAPPING, and STRIPPING, • FORWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (FCR), • BACKWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (BCR;  1 We will not deal with the elliptical constructions known as VP Ellipsis, VP Anaphora and Pseudogapping because they involve the generation of pro-forms instead of, or in addi-tion to, the ellipsis proper. For example, John laughed, and Mary did, too—a case of VP Ellipsis—includes the pro-form did. Nor do we deal with recasts of clausal coordinations as coordinate NPs (e.g., John likes skating and Peter likes skiing becoming John and Peter like skating and skiing, respectively). Presumably, such conversions involve a logical rather than syntactic mechanism. 25","also called Right Node Raising), and • SUBJECT GAP IN CLAUSES WITH FINITE/","FRONTED VERBS (SGF). They are illustrated in the English sentences (2) through (8). The subscripts denote the elliptical mechanism at work: g stands for Gapping, Subgapping, and Stripping, respectively; g(g) +","is recursively added for LDG; f = FCR; s = SGF; b = BCR.

Thus, the rules apply to assembled non-elliptical (unreduced) tree structures in the final stage of generation. Due to this feature, ELLEIPO can be combined, at least in principle, with various lexicalized-grammar formalisms. However, this advantage does not come entirely for free: The module needs a formalismdependent interface that converts generator output to a canonical form consisting of “flat” syntactic trees where all major clause constituents 2 Coordinate structures consist of two or more conjuncts connected by a coordinating conjunction (in our examples: and). Rules of coordinate ellipsis license elision of some consituent in one conjunct under “identity” with a constituent in another conjunct. We distinguish between lemma identity, where only the word-stems of the constituents have to be identical, and wordform identity, which requires not only identity of the stems but also of their morphological features.","Gapping only requires lemma identity (cf. examples (2) and (4)). In FCR, word-form identity is checked, i.e. the identical word string referring to the same referent (cf. *The boy loves dogs and [the boys]f hate cats). are represented at the same hierarchical level (see Harbusch and Kempen 2006; 2007).","In the following, we introduce ELLEIPO’s elision rules only in an informal manner (for the pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). The rules described in the following can be applied in any order to unreduced syntactic structures in canonical form. In case of a successful rule application, the elidable constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indicating the ellipsis type (as illustrated in (2) through (8)). ELLEIPO’s final step executes all possible elliptical combinations (e.g., for example (1), it also realizes a version with Subgapping and LDG, respectively, i.e.: Monopole sollen geknackt werden und Märkte solleng getrennt werdengg).","In Gapping (see examples (9) and (10)), lemma-identical verbs can be elided from the second conjunct, if and only if a contrast is expressed, i.e. each remaining constituent in this conjunct has a counterpart with the same grammatical function in the first conjunct (cf. (11)). 3"," (9) Mari loeb artikleid ja tema pojad _g pakse raa-","matuid Mari liest Artikel und ihre Söhne _g dicke Bücher Mari reads articles and her sons thick books (10) Jüri elab Tartus ja Tallinnas _g tema pojad Jüri lebt in Tartu und in Tallinn _g seine Söhne Jüri lives in Tartu and in Tallinn his sons (11) *Mari ostab pirne ja Jüri _g turul *Mari kauft Birnen und Jüri _g auf dem Markt Mari buys pears and Jüri on the market","In Long-Distance Gapping (LDG), the remnants, i.e. the non-elided constituents in the posterior conjunct, include constituents whose anterior counterparts belong to different clauses. My wife in (12) (translation of (3)) belongs to the main clause whereas a car is part of the infinitival complement clause. Notice that LDG does not require adjacency of the elided verbs (cf. the German example in (12)).

For the same reason, we only discuss examples with two conjuncts (although, ELLEIPO analyses n-ary coordinations as well), and cannot pay attention to coordinate structures that include negation. 26 clause (“VP”; severely wounded in (13); translation of (4)).

This remnant is not a verb, and it is often supplemented by a modifier (such too in (14), the translation of (5)). (14) Mu õde elab Narvas ja mu vend _g samuti/ka. Meine Schwester lebt in Narva und mein Bruder _g ebenso/ auch","In Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR), a left-peripheral string of major constituents in the right conjunct is elided under wordform-identity with its counterpart in the right conjunct. In FCR example (15), the left-peripheral string comprising complementizer, subject and direct object are elided from the right-hand conjunct. If modifiers that are neither lemma- nor wordform-identical, are placed in between subject and object—as in (16)—, then elision of the object is blocked. (Actually, example (16) is not ill-formed but its right-hand conjunct cannot be interpreted as cleaning the bike.) In main-clause variant (17), elision of the direct object is blocked for similar reasons. (15) ... et Jan oma jalgratta asjatundlikult parandas ... dass Jan sein Fahrrad fachkundig reparierte ... that Jan his bike expertly repaired ja [et Jan oma jalgratta]f hoolikalt puhastas und [dass Jan sein Fahrrad]f eifrig putzte","and that Jan his bike diligently cleaned (16) *... et Jan asjatundlikult oma jalgratta parandas ... dass Jan fachkundig sein Fahrrad reparierte ja [et Jan]f hoolikalt [oma jalgratta]f puhastas und [dass Jan]f eifrig [sein Fahrrad]f putzte (17) * Jan parandas oma jalgratta asjatundlikult * Jan reparierte sein Fahrrad fachkundig ja Janf puhastas [oma jalgratta]f hoolikalt und Janf putzte [sein Fahrrad]f eifrig","Backward-Conjunction Reduction (BCR) licenses elision of a right-peripheral string in the left-hand conjunct under lemma-identity 4","with its counterpart in the right conjunct. However, unlike FCR’s mirror image, BCR may cut into major constituents of the clause. In BCR example (18), the direct object can be elided in the first conjunct whereas in word-order variant (19), the verb blocks this elision. Example (20) illustrates that BCR, unlike the three other ellipsis types, may cut into major clausal constituents and only  4 ELLEIPO also checks case-identity to rule out ?Hilf _","b[DAT] und reanimier [den Mann]ACC ‘Help and reanimate the man’ checks lemma-identity. Varying the objects to ‘new bike’/‘old bikes’, and the second subject ‘Peter’ to ‘his brothers’ does not rule out ellipsis as long as peripheral access is guaranteed. (18) Jan parandas [oma jalgratta]b Jan reparierte [sein Fahrrad]b Jan repaired his bike ja Peeter puhastas oma jalgratta und Peter putzte sein Fahrrad and Peter cleaned his bike (19) *... et Jan [oma jalgratta]b parandas * ... dass Jan [sein Fahrrad]b reparierte ja et Peeter oma jalgratta puhastas und dass Peter sein Fahrrad putzte (20) Jan parandas oma uue jalgrattab Jan reparierte sein neues Fahrradb ja tema vennad puhastasid oma vanad jalgrattad und seine Brüder putzten ihre alten Fahrräder","Examples (21)-(23) embody word-order variants within two simple coordinated clauses. The (il)licit elision patterns verify that in BCR the ellipsis should be right-peripheral in the left-hand conjunct, whereas in FCR the ellipsis is located left-peripherally in the right-hand conjunct.

In particular, it should be the subject of this clause (as in (24), translation of (8)) or a modifier (25), but not an argument other than the subject, e.g. neither complement nor (in)direct object (26). Additionally, if FCR is also possible, it should actually be realized in order to license SGF (for additional discussion of these restrictions, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2009).

ELLEIPO’s language-independent core algorithm generates Estonian ellipsis as well, as shown by the demonstrator. For the sake of completeness, we should add here that we have not been able to find types of clausal coordinate ellipsis in Estonian that go beyond the above four types; hence, as far as we can tell, Estonian does not require additional rules over and above those we needed for German and Dutch."]},{"title":"3 State of the art in ellipsis generation","paragraphs":["All major grammar formalisms provide rules for clausal coordinate ellipsis—rules that tend to be intertwined with rules for nonelliptical coordination (e.g. Sarkar and Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory Categorial Grammar; Frank (2002) for Functional Grammar; Crysman (2003) and Beavers and Sag (2004) for HPSG; and te Velde (2006) for the Minimalist Program). This also applies to many NLG systems (cf. Reiter and Dale, 2000). Generators that do include an autonomous component for coordinate ellipsis— that is, a component that takes unreduced coordinations expressed in the system’s grammar for-malism as input and return elliptical versions as output (Shaw, 1998; Dalianis, 1999; Hielkema, 2005)—use incomplete rule sets, thus risking over- or undergeneration, and incorrect or un-natural output."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Finally, we do not expect that the four types of clausal coordinate ellipsis presented here are “universal” in the sense that all natural languages exhibit all four of them and no language has additional types (see Harbusch and Kempen 2009 for some discussion based on language-typological work by Haspelmath, 2007).
