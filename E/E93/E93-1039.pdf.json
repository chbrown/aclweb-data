It is a tribute both to the resilience of human language understanding and to the in-genuity of the inventors of these algorithms that the results are as intelligible as they are. However, the result is very frequently unnatural, and may on occasion mislead the hearer. This paper extends earlier work on the relation between syntax and intonation in language understanding in Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). A generator with a simple and domain-independent discourse model can be used to direct synthesis of intonation contours for responses to data-base queries, to convey distinctions of contrast and emphasis determined by the discourse model. 1 The Problem Consider the exchange shown in example (1). Capitals indicate stress, and brackets informally indicate the intonational phrasing.

The other annotations indicate that the intonational tunes L+H* LH% and H* LL% convey two distinct kinds of discourse information. First, both pitch accents mark any word that they occur on (or rather, its interpretation) for \"focus\", which in the context of such simple queries as example (1) usually implies contrast of some kind. Second, the tunes as a whole mark the constituent that bears them (or rather, its interpretation) as having a particular function in the discourse. We have argued at length elsewhere that, at least in this same restricted class of dialogues, the function of the L+H* LH% tune is to mark the \"theme\" - that is, \"what the participants have agreed to talk about\". The H* LL% tune (and its relative the H* L tune) mark the \"theme\" - that is, \"what the speaker has to say\" about the theme. This phenomenon is a strong one: the same intonation contour sounds quite anomalous in the context of a question that does not establish the correct open proposition as the theme, such as Which device has the fast processor?. One further point is worth noting: the unit that we are calling the theme is not in this example a traditional syntactic constituent. Many problems in the analysis and synthesis of spoken language result from the partial independence of syntactic and intonational phrase boundaries.","The architecture of our system (shown in Figure 1) is for the most part self-explanatory, but we note that we follow a long tradition in separating the process of generation itself into two phases.

[12], [13], and [15]). We assign to all constituents an autonomous prosodic category, expressing their potential for combination with other prosodic categories. Then we lock these two structural systems together via the following principle, which says that syntactic and prosodic constituency must be isomorphic:","(S) PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine via a prosodic combinatory rule.","One way to do this is to make the boundaries arguments and the pitch accents functions over them. The boundaries are as follows: 4","(9) L :- b : 1 LL% :- b : il LH% := b : lh As in CCG, categories consist of a structural type, here b for boundary, and an interpretation, associated via a colon. The pitch accents have the following functional types: 5","(10) L+H* := p : lheme/b : lh H* := p:rheme/b:l, P:rheme/b:ll We further assume, following Bird [2], that the presence of a pitch accent causes some element(s) in the translation of the category to be marked as focussed, a matter which we will for simplicity assume occurs at the level of the lexicon. For example, when includes bears a pitch accent, its category will be as follows: (11) (S:(*include')xYkNP:y)/NP:x The categories that result from the combination of a pitch accent and a boundary may or may not constitute entire prosodic phrases, since there may be a prenuclear null tone. There may also be a null tone separating the pitch accent(s) from the boundary. aA similar argument in a related categorial framework","is made by Moortgat [6]. 4These categories slightly depart from Pierrehumbert. 5 Here we are ignoring the possibility of multiple pitch","accents in the same prosodic phrase, but cf. [13]. (Both possibilities are illustrated in (1)). We therefore assign the following category to the null tone, which can thereby apply to the right to any non-functional category of the form X : Y, and compose to their right with any function into such a category, including another null tone, to yield the same category: (12) 0 := X:Y/X:Y It is this omnivorous category that allows intonational tunes to be spread over arbitrarily large constituents, since it allows the pitch accent's desire for a boundary to propagate via composition into the null tone category (see the earlier papers).","In order to allow the derivation to proceed above the level of complete prosodic phrases identifying themes and rhemes, we need two unary category-changing rules to mark the interpretation a of the corresponding grammatical category with that discourse function and change the phonological category, thus: 6","(13) ~ ::~ p : X p/p","(14) ~, => P:X p These rules change the prosodic category either to p, or to an endocentric function over p. (These types capture the fact that the LL% boundary can only occur at the end of a sentence, thereby correcting an overgeneration in the version of this theory in Steedman [13], noted by Bird [2]). The fact that p is an atom rather than a term of the form X : Y is important, since it means that it can combine only with another p. This is vital to the preservation of the intonation structure/","The application of the above two rules to a complete intonational phrase should be thought of as precipitating a side-effect whereby a copy of the category E is associated with the clause as its theme or rheme.

Our computational model (shown in Figure 1) starts with a prosodically annotated wh-question given as a string of words with associated Pierrehumbert-style pitch accent and boundary markings. We employ a simple bottom-up shift-reduce parser of the kind presented in [14], making direct use of the CCG-Prosody theory described above, to identify the semantics of the question. The","9See the next section concerning the nondeterminism inherent in this rule. inclusion of prosodic categories in the grammar allows the parser to identify the information structure (theme and theme) within the question as well.

The complete specification of the semantic and information structures provided by the parser is used by the generator to determine the intelligible and prosodically natural response. For","1°The alert reader will note that the notation for constants, variables, and functional application is slightly changed in these sections, to correspond to the Prolog implementation.","11This is a simplification, but a harmless one for the simplified query domains that we are dealing with here. 335 a wh-question, the semantic representation corresponds to a lambda expression in one or more variables ranging over individuals in the database, and has the structure of a Prolog query which we can evaluate to determine the possible instantiations of the open proposition. The instantiated proposition determines the semantic proposition to be conveyed in the response. For the example above, this is part(sprockets)&include( .wodgets, .sprockets) - \"Wodgets include sprockets\".","Note that the derived semantics includes the necessary occurrences of the focus predicate *, determined as follows. All terms that are focused in the question semantics are focused in the response semantics. Intuitively, the instantiated variable in the response semantics must also be focused since it represents the information which is new in the response. For more complex rhemes such as quantified NPs with modifiers, we focus those elements of the semantic representation that are new in the current context. (That is, ones which did not figure in the interpretation of the original query). Thus, given a question such as (1), we choose to focus the modifier \"fast\" rather than the noun \"processor\" in the rheme. Similary, in the exchange below, we focus \"processor\" instead of \"fast\" because of its newness in the context.","(20) Q: What fast component does the widget include? A: The widget includes a fast PROCES-SOR.","To determine an appropriate intonation contour for the utterance, we must further determine the appropriate information structure. Fortunately, for the simple question-answering task, the information structure of the response can be assumed to be completely determined by the original query. The theme of a question corresponds to \"what the question is about\" - in this case, \"parts\". The theme of a question corresponds to \"what the speaker wants to know about the theme\" - here, \"What wodgets include\". It follows that we expect the theme of the question to determine the theme of the response. For example (18), the theme of the response should be S : include(.wodgets, x)/NP : x, as in (21) below. Note that we simplify the strategic generation problem by including the syntactic category in our represention of the theme (as determined by the syntactic category of the theme of the original question)) 2 Given the syntactic and semantic representation of the theme of the response, the CCG combination rules can easily be invoked to determine the theme of the response. The rheme is simply the complement","12Here we are cutting another corner: the theme, and hence the rheme, are fully specified syntactically, as well as semantically, as a result of the analysis of the question: in a more general system, we would presumably need to specify syntactic type from scratch, starting from pure semantics. of the theme with respect to the overall semantics of the response, as in (21) below, obtained by instantiating the result and one input of the appropriate combinatory rule (cf.

In constructing a tactical generation schema, several design options are available, including bottom-up, top-down and semantic head-driven models ([3], [10]). We adopt a hybrid approach, employing a basic top-down strategy that takes advantage of the CCG notion of \"functional head\" to avoid fruitless search. While this technique exhibits some inefficiencies characteristic of a depth-first search, it has several significant advantages. First, it does not rely on a specific semantic representation, and requires only that the semantics be compositional and representable in Prolog. Thus the generating procedure is independent of the particular grammar. This modular character of the system has been very useful in developing the competence grammar proposed in the preceding section, and offers a basis for proving the completeness of the implementation with respect to the competence theory.","The tactical generation program is written in Prolog, and works as follows. Starting with a syntactic constituent (initially s) and a semantic formula, we utilize the CCG reduction rules to determine possible subconstituents that can combine to yield the original constituent, invoking the generator recursively to generate the proposed subconstituents. The base case of the recursion occurs when a category we wish to generate unifies with a category in the lexicon. For example, suppose we wish to generate an utterance corresponding to the category s:walks'(mary'). Since the given category does not unify with any category in the lexicon, the program proposes possible subconstituents by checking the CCG combination rules in some pre-determined order. By the backward function application rule, we might hypothesize that the categories x and s:walks'(mary')\\z are the subconstituents of s:walks'(mary'), where x is","13Again the example is simplified by the use of a non-raised category for the object. 336","(22) gen(s:def(x, ((engine(x)~new(x))&shiny(x))~","def(y, ((gear(y)&rotating(y))&largest(y))~contains(x,y)))).

For this reason, our generator always chooses to recursively generate the subconstituent that acts as the functional head before the subconstituent that acts as the argument under the CCG combinatory rules. By strictly observing this principle, we ensure that as much semantic information as possible is deployed, thereby constraining the search space by prohibiting spurious unifications with incorrect items in the lexicon. For this reason, we refer to our generation scheme as a \"functional head\"-driven, top-down approach.","One disadvantage of the top-down generation technique is its susceptibility to the non-termination problem. If a given path through the search space does not lead to unification with an item in the lexicon, some condition which aborts the path in question at some search depth must be imposed. Note that whenever the CCG function application rules are used to propose possible subconstituents to be recursively generated, the subconstituent acting as the functional head has one more curried argument than its parent. Since we know that in English there is a limit to the number of arguments that a functional category can take, we can abort fruitless search paths by imposing a limit on the number of curried arguments that a CCG category can possess.
