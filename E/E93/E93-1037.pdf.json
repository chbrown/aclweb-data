We see that the discourse segment reduces the domain of antecedents for zero anaphora and thus leads to their efficient resolution. Also we make crucial use of functional no-tions such as empathy hierarchy and minimal semantics thesis to resolve reference for zero anaphora [Kuno, 1987]. Our al)proach differs from the Centering analysis [Walker et al., 1990] in that the resolution works by matching one empathy hierarchy against another, which makes it possible to deal with discourses with no explicit topic and those with cataphora [Halliday and Hassan, 1990]. The theory is formalized through the definite clause grammar(DCG) formalism [Pereira and Warren, 1980],[Gazdar and Mellish, 1989; Longacre, 1979]. Finally, we show that graphology i.e., quotation mark, spacing, has an important effect on the interpretation of zero anaphora in Japanese discourse. 1 Introduction Over the past years, schemes like Focusing and Centering have dominated computational approaches to resolving anaphora [Sidner, 1983; Walker et al., 1990]. Their success derives from the utility they have in identifying salient discourse entities such as topic and thereby locating the antecedent for an anaphor. But they all suffer from the problem of directionality; they process the text (the list of sentences) from left to right, picking out focus along the way and see if a anaphor corefers with a focus already encountered. With the one-way processing, forward-looking pronouns (cataphora) are not possible to resolve. Since Japanese has great tolerance with forward reference, a proper theory of zero pronouns should meet the problem of directionality.","In what follows, we discuss some points about discourse segment and zero pronoun in Japanese. We begin by introducing the idea of discourse segment. Consider the pair:"]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["Taro-go sara<i>-wo dasi, Hanako","nora plate ace prepare-and -go 02<i> ryori -wo morituketa. nora food acc arranged Taro prepared the plates, Hanako arranged food on them.","(2) Taro -ga sara<~> -wo dasi, Hanako<i> -wa top 01<i> 02<k> ryori-wo morituketa. Taro prepared the plates, Hanako arranged food. Here, 02 represents a suppressed expression. It acts as an indirect object of the verb moritsuketa. 1 1 and 2 are morphologically identical except that 1 has ga (nominative marker) where 2 has wa (topic marker). But they differ widely in meaning:l implies that Hanako arranged food on the plates that Taro prepared, the reading 2 does not imply; in 2,","1Here and throughout, we intend the term 01 to represent a zero pronoun for the subject, 02 for the indirect object, and 03 for the direct object. 315 Hanako could have arranged food on plates some-body other than Taro prepared. Now locating the difference will involve the notion of discourse segment. A discourse segment is defined as a set of sentences which appear in some region of text and which is delimited by a topic-particle wa. Thus 2 breaks up into two segments, a clause with Taro-ga and one with Hanako-wa;1, containing no wa-marked element, forms a segment by itself. Section 2.1 provides syntactic definitions for the discourse segment.","Another important feature of discourse segment is that of complying with the Minimal Semantics Thesis (MST) [Nomoto, 1992], a functional property that makes a segment cohere. The MST says, 'Assume as identical any pair of zero pronouns if it is part of some segment and does not occur as arguments for the segment's predicate.' Thus any pair of zero pronouns that fall into the domain of discourse segment are taken to be coreferential, unless they occur for the same predicate. 2 Significantly, the MST is amenable to syntactic treatment.","In addition, we make use of ~he empathy hierarchy to choose between coreference relationships admitted by the MST. We specify a predicate for the empathy hierarchy and resolve zero anaphora by unifying one predicate's empathy hierarchy with another which occurs in the same segment. Since unification is a non-directional operation, we are able to treat forward as well as backward reference."]},{"title":"2 Theory","paragraphs":["2.1 General A discourse segment (DS) is a two-part structure consisting of head and body; a head is a nominal with a wa marking; a body is a set of sentences, which end with a period. Note that an adjunctive clause is not a sentence here, since it ends with connectives like .node because, .kara because/after, .to and-then, etc. Formally, we assume sentence has the following analyses, which are given in the DCG formalism. (3) S -> C+, N(pp:1~a).","S -> C*, N(pp:~a) ,C+.","S -> C+. c+ denotes one or more occurrences of clause, C* zero or more occurrences of clause, and N (pp : wa) denotes a wa-marked nominal;pp:wa specifies that the at-tribute pp (for postposition) has wa for the value.3Let us define discourse segment by:","2 [Hobbs, to appear] talks about the cognitive economy in understanding discourse: it says in effect that coherence is the result of minimizing the number of entities in discourse."]},{"title":"3We","paragraphs":["take a wa-marked nominal to be a sentence adverbial.

A head attribute, once instantiated to some value, will never unify with another. Unification, therefore, acts to limit each segment in the discourse to a single head. Note also that an non-headed discourse, that is, discourse with no headed segments, has a legitimate DS analysis, for unification is possible between empty heads.

It appears, however, that a discourse segment always comes out headed except when there is no head avail-able in the text.

Then put in salt. Add meat after 5 rain. We see that 14 constitutes a single discourse segment. According to the minimal semantics thesis, all of the zeros in the segment are interpreted as coreferential, which is consistent with the reading we have for the example. Here is a more complex discourse. 317","(15) Taro-wa 01<i> machi-niitte, 01<i> huku","top town to go cloth -wokatta.

Masako got it for her birthday present and she was very happy. The first two zeros refer to Taro and the last two refer to Masako. But this is exactly what the MST predicts; 15 breaks up into two discourse segments, one that starts with Taro-wa and the other that starts with Masako-wa, so zeros for each segment become coreferential. 2.4 Empathy Hierarchy It appears to be a fact about Japanese that the speaker of an utterance empathizes or identifies more with the subject than with the indirect object; and more with the indirect object than with the direct object [Kuno, 1987; Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977]. In fact, there are predicates in Japanese which are lexitally specified to take an empathy-loaded argument; yaru give and kureru receive are two such. For yaru, the speaker empathizes with the subject, hut with the indirect object, in the case of kureru.","The relevance of the speaker's empathy to the resolution problem is that an empathized entity becomes more salient than other elements in the discourse and thus more likely to act as the antecedent for an anaphor.","(16) Taro-ga Masako<j> -ni hon -wo katte nom to book acc buy -kureta.

A major departure from the traditional analyses of zero anaphora lies in the reduction of the space of antecedents for zero anaphora. This has been made possible by adopting ideas like Discourse Segment, Minimal Semantics Thesis and Empathy Hierarchy. In particular, we have shown that the Minimal Semantics Thesis leads to reducing the number of antecedents for a segment to at most three. Also shown in the paper is that the resolution of zero anaphora is part of parsing text, so no additional mechanism is","9 We may note that a recursive embedding of discourse of the sort we have discussed above is effected through the explicit use of quotation marks; their absence would lead to the outright nngrammaticality. needed. Furthermore, the present theory compares favorably with the previous schemes like Focusing and Centering in that it is able to deal with forward-and backward-looking anaphora by virtue of the way unification operates on the empathy hierarchy.","Part of our discussion has touched on the effect of graphology on the semantics of discourse. To date, no significant research has been done on that area of academic interests.

Thus a discourse segment might qualify for the texthood since it has the property that zero pronouns are resolved internally. Its indicator is, of course, the topic particle wa. But for the T-structure, it is far from clear whether it is anyway cohesive, and if it is, what its indicators are. (Quotation mark and paragraph break are possible candidates.)","Some of the technical as well as linguistic details are yet to be worked out; we have not talked about how the topic comes to be associated with one or more zero pronouns in the segment.
