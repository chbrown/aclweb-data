(1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). Certain phenomena, in particular the head-switching of adverbs and verbs, seem to be problematic for that approach. In this paper we suggest that these difficulties are more properly considered as the result of defective monolingual analyses. We propose a new description-language operator, restriction, to permit a succinct formal encoding of the informal intuition that semantic units sometimes correspond to subsets of functional information. This operator, in conjunction with an additional recursion provided by a description-by-analysis rule, is the basis of a more adequate account of head-switching that preserves the advantages of correspondence-based translation."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Kaplan et al. (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). LFG formulates the syntactic dependencies and generalizations of natural languages in terms of the properties of formal structures of different types: ordinary phrase-structure trees represent the surface constituency of sentences while hierarchical finite functions represent their underlying grammatical relations. The structures for a particular sentence are those that satisfy descriptions produced from annotated phrase-structure rules and lexical entries. The description of the more abstract functional structure is determined by the dominance and precedence relations of the superficial constituent structure, given the assumption that there is a piecewise correspondence function that maps the nodes in the c-structure tree into the units of the f-structure. Kaplan (1987) and Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988) extend this structure/description/correspondence architecture to provide modular and declarative characterizations of the relationships between syntactic structures and other levels of linguistic representation. Kaplan et al. (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. In particular, the approach permits features from different linguistic levels to affect translation without requiring that reflexes of those disparate features appear together in an otherwise unmotivated transfer or interlingual representation.","Kaplan et al. (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. These examples involve changes in grammatical functions from source to target, differences in control, and differences in embedding (or head-switching). The Kaplan et al. solutions depend on monolingual representations of phrasal, functional, and semantic information related by the correspondences ~p and a, with translation 193 correspondences • and ~' mapping source to target structures, as shown in the configuration in (1):"]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["Source \" \" Target • ' semantic structure O --------.-~ O °/ ~' ~° f_structur e o ~_..__.._..-------~ o di) 0 / ~ ~: c-structure These solutions utilize the formal device of codescription to specify the target structure constraints in terms of simple compositions of the","and z' mappings with the monolingual source correspondences. For instance, the fact that the object of the German beantworten corresponds to the AOBJ of the French r~pondre is indicated by associating the following transfer equations with the normal monolingual lexical entry for beantworten:","(2) (~ ~ PRED FN) = rdpondre (1; T SUBJ)= 1;( ~ SUB J) (~ ~ AOBJ)= ~( ~' OBJ) The last line asserts that the AOBJ in the target f-structure is the translation of the source OBJ. The metavariable ~ in LFG is an abbreviation for (1)(M(*)) and thus denotes the f-structure that corresponds to the mother of the beantworten lexical node in the German c-structure (indicated by *). The expression • ~ can then be seen as ~(~(M(*))) = ~ o ~b(M(*)) and thus as incorporating the composition ~odp. Significantly, the M(*) term is also present, which means that the target constraints are determined in the same recursive analysis of the source c-structure that is used to derive the source f-structure description. The codescription device crucially involves both a composition of correspondences and a single recursive analysis of common ancestor structures. This contrasts with description-by-analysis, another technique mentioned by Kaplan and Halvorsen (1988) and Kaplan et aL (1989) for deriving descriptions of abstract structures."]},{"title":"2. Difficulties with the correspondence approach","paragraphs":["This proposal for correspondence-based translation has been scrutinized by a number of researchers (e.g. Sadler et al., 1989, Sadler et al., 1990, Sadler and Thompson, 1991), and several difficulties have been pointed out. These difficulties arise particularly in cases where the independently motivated source and target structures are not very closely aligned, where single units in a source structure map to multiple units in the target (so-called splitting) or where hierarchical relationships are interchanged in mapping from source to target (switching). If such discrepancies are both locally bounded and predictable, then they can in principle be handled by means of codescription statements involving the ordinary monolingual description-language constructs of function-application and equality. But even if possible, such conservative treatments may not permit obvious generalizations about the translation relation to be naturally expressed. Sadler et al. (1990) demonstrate this point by examples in which the translation of a lexical head differs according to its dependents in the source sentence (English commit suicide translates to French (se) suicider whereas commit a crime translates to commettre une crime). They suggest refining the basic correspondence approach by separating such idiosyncratic source-target interactions into a separate transfer lexicon whose stipulations will override (perhaps via the priority union operator) the generic transfer specifications that might still be associated with the source-language predicates.","Sadler et al. (1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) focus on another case of structural misalignment in translation, as illustrated in (3):","(3) (a) The baby just fell. (b) Le b~b~ vient de tomber. The syntactic head of the English sentence (fell) corresponds to the head of the French embedded complement (tomber), while the English adjunct just corresponds to the head of the French matrix. Other well-known contrasts show syntactic embeddings in English corresponding to sentential adjuncts in Dutch (and German): 194","(4) (a) John likes to swim. (b) Janzwemt graag. Kaplan et al. (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. On one account, head-switching is accomplished by mapping the source S node to an f-structure that contains information about the central clausal relations but excludes adjunct information. The ADV node maps to an f-structure that has the adverb as its main predicate with the central clausal f-structure appearing in argument position. The 'just' f-structure, though not accessible from the S node, maps through t to the outermost target f-structure. This complex interchange is specified in the lexical entry and rule in (5) and is diagrammed in Figure 1 (ignoring such details as person, number, case, and tense).

(1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) point out a significant inadequacy of both these arrangements.

This shows up as a problem when such examples are embedded as complements in larger sentences:","(7) (a) I think that the baby just fell. (b) Je pense que le bdbd vient de tomber.

Head-switching with integrated f-structure The z constraints thus leave unspecified the relative scopes of the penser and venir predicates. As Sadler et al. (1989) observe, the problem is even worse when several adverbs appear together: there is no obvious way to modify either of the rules (hb) or (6) to account for the scope interactions among the adverbs, let alone their relations to higher predicates.","Sadler et al. (1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) consider several ways in which the translation constraints might be modified to circumvent these difficulties yet remain faithful to the spirit of the correspondence-based approach. While each of their proposals is carefully worked out, they conclude (and we agree) that none of them is completely satisfactory or particularly compelling. The reason, we believe, is that the head-switching with adverbial modifiers that shows up as a problem in correspondence-based translation is actually a symptom of a more fundamental error in the syntactic and semantic analysis of the source language. In sentences with adverbial modifiers, the syntactic head (which controls subcategorization and enters into agreement relations) is not the same as the semantic head (the predicate with widest scope). Moreover, normal linguistic arguments would assign a flat f-structure to sentences with several adverbs while meaning relations would be represented in a hierarchical semantic structure. Thus on this view, if translation codescriptions map from the proper hierarchical semantic structures via ~' instead of from flat f-structures via ~, adverbial head-switching disappears as a special problem for correspondence-based translation.","Sadler and Thompson (1991, footnote I) mention the arrangement we are proposing, and observe that the translation codescription problems may then merely be displaced to equivalent difficulties in characterizing the monolingual o instead of z: the problems may be moved around and renamed, but not solved. This may be so, but any conceptual clarification in such a murky domain must be regarded as an advance, if only because it helps to spotlight the issues that are relevant to a solution and to connect them to other related phenomena. Indeed, we now suggest that adverbial head-switching is a special case of the general problem of mapping flat syntactic structures to hierarchical semantic ones. So-called \"light verbs\", complex-predicates, and clause-union phenomena in many languages are similarly difficult to handle in LFG using only codescription, attribute-value function-application, and equality constraints (or using the analogous formal devices of other theories, such as attribute-value unification over signs or categories). In the next section of this paper, we extend LFG's f-structure description language by introducing a new formal operator, called restriction. We illustrate its properties by applying it to a simple light-predicate sentence in Urdu. In Section 4 we combine restriction with description-by-analysis to characterize the appropriate hierarchical semantic structures for English sentential adverbs. At the end, we return to the head-switching problem of correspondence-based translation, providing a simple solution in terms of the ~' correspondence."]},{"title":"3. The restriction operator and structural misalignments","paragraphs":["A simple kind of syntax/semantics misalignment is exemplified by constructions involving light-verbs or complex predicates. These are 196 constructions formed by two or more verbs involving two or more semantic relations, but with the notable peculiarity that the complex behaves as a single, monoclausal syntactic unit according to standard tests of subcategorization and agreement. Butt et al. (1990) have argued persuasively that Urdu complex predicates are syntactically monoclausal and further, that the complex predicate cannot be formed in the lexicon. The details of the argument do not matter for present purposes, and we will simply accept their analysis of sentence (10a) whose English translation is given in (10b). The c-, f-, and semantic-structures, according to their analysis, are shown in Figure 3.","(I0) (a) Anjum-ne diyaa Saddaf-koxat likhne. (b) Anjum let Saddafwrite a letter. The crucial feature of this analysis is that there is a single set of governed grammatical functions in the f-structure, and these are derived systematically from the normal subcategorization of the main predicate likhne 'write'. The governable functions of diyaa when it stands as an independent predicate (usually glossed as the ditransitive predicate 'give') are not represented in the f-structure. The second obvious feature is that the flat f-structure maps to the hierarchical semantic structure, where the outer predicate has the permissive reading conveyed by diyaa in its light-verb sense and the inner proposition contains the main predicate and its arguments. This analysis cannot be formulated using standard codescription, function-application, and equality because there is no separate level in the f-structure that the inner semantic proposition can correspond to and thus no way to describe its properties.","While there may be a technical problem in finding a structure that the inner proposition can correspond to, there is a very clear intuition about what parts of the f-structure carry the information that constrains that piece of the semantic structure, namely, the sub-f-structure obtained by eliminating the SUBJ attribute and value.

The ARG3 hierarchy in the semantic structure is not the image of an attribute embedding in the f-structure as is usually the case; rather, the semantic hierarchy here corresponds to a subsumption relation in the f-structure lattice. This organization of informational dependencies can be expressed by means of the restriction operator.","Restriction is a new operator in the f-structure description language notated by \\ and with the following (partial) definition: Figure 3.

Thus, restriction and function-application can be used to impose complementary constraints on f-structure values. We note that restriction is associative and commutative in its second (attribute) argument, so that [f\\a] \\b = [f\\b] \\a = f\\(ab}, and that for any f-structure f and attribute a it is always the case that f\\a subsumes f (f\\a V- f).","Returning now to the Urdu example, we see that if the top-level f-structure (the one corresponding to the S node) is denoted by f, the subsidiary f-structure to which corresponds the inner proposition in (11) is the restriction off by SUBJ and can be referred to by the expression f\\SUBJ. The restriction operator can be used in codescription statements so that exactly the configuration in (11) is assigned to the Urdu sentence. A lexical redundancy rule can be introduced to systematically modify the lexical entries for normal verbs like likhne to make them suitable for combination with a light-verb:","(15) ( ~ SUBJ) --* ( T OBJ2) o 1' --* o[ 1' \\SUBJ] This rule replaces all references to the grammatical function SUBJ with OBJ2, thus avoiding conflict with the SUBJ introduced by the light verb, and it replaces all occurrences of the term o 1' with the term o[ 1' kSUBJ]. This indicates that the main predicate provides constraints on the semantic structure corresponding to the subject-free f-structure. As a result of this rule, the usual equations for likhne in (16a) would give rise to the alternatives in (16b):","(16) (a) (o 1' ARG1) ---- o( ~ SUBJ) (o1' ARG2) ---- o( ~ OBJ)","(b) (o[ 1'~SUBJ] ARG1)=o( ~ OBJ2) (o[ 1' ~SUBJ] ARG2)---- o( T OBJ) The lexical rule would also make other minor adjustments to fill out the entry; the details do not concern us here."]},{"title":"4.

Constraints of this general form cannot be produced by the normal recursive analysis of the c-structure because the c-structure itself, by linguistic argumentation, does not have the degree of embedding that these constraints would require.
