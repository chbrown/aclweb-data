The Constraint Grammar parser of English is a sequential modular system that assigns a shallow surface-true dependency-oriented functional analysis on running text, annotating each word with morphological and syntactic tags. The finite-state parser assigns a similar type of analysis, but it operates on all levels of ambiguity 2 in parallel rather than sequentially, enabling the grammarian to refer to all levels of structural description in a single uniform rule component.","ENGCG, a wide-coverage English Constraint Grammar and lexicon, was written 1989-1992, and the system is currently available 3. The Constraint Grammar framework was proposed by Fred Karlsson, and the English Constraint Grammar was developed by Afro Voutilainen (lexicon, morphological disambiguation), Juha Heikkil~i (lexicon) and Arto Anttila (syntax). There are a few implementations","lit consists of a base form, a morphological reading - part-of-speech, inflectional and other morphosyntactic features - and a syntactic-functional tag, flanked by '@'.","~Morphological, clause boundary, and syntactic ambiguities","3The ENGCG parser can currently be tested automatically via E-mail by sending texts of up to 300 words to engcg@ling.Helsinki.FI. The reply will contain the analysis as well as information on usage and availability. Questions can also be directly sent to avoutila@ling.Helsinki.FI or to pt apanai@ling.Helsinki.FI. 394 of the parser, and the latest, written in C by Pasi Tapanainen, analyses more than 1000 words per second on a Sun SparcStationl0, using a disambiguation grammar of some 1300 constraints.","Intensive work within the finite-state framework was started by Tapanainen [1991] in 1990, and an operational parser was in existence the year after. The first nontrivial finite-state descriptions [Koskenniemi etal., 1992] were written by Voutilainen 1991-1992, and currently he is working on a comprehensive English grammar which is expected to reach a considerable degree of maturity by the end of 1994. Much of this emerging work is based on the ENGCG description, (e.g. the ENGTWOL lexicon is used as such); however, the design of the grammar has changed considerably, as will be seen below.","We have two main theses. Firstly, knowledge-based reductionistic grammatical analysis will be facilitated rather than hindered by the introduction of (new) linguistically motivated and structurally resolvable distinctions into the parsing scheme, although this policy will increase the amount of ambiguity in the parser's input. Secondly, the amount of ambiguity in the input does not predict the speed of analysis, so introduction of new ambiguities in the input is not necessarily something to be avoided.","Next, we present some observations about the ENGCG parser: the linguistic description would become more economic and accurate if all levels of structural description were available at the outset of reductionistic parsing (or disambiguation of alternative readings). In Section 3 we report on some early experiments with finite-state parsing. In Section 4 we sketch a more satisfactory functional dependency-oriented description. A more expressive representation implies more ambiguity in the input; in Section 5 it is shown, however, that even massive ambiguity need be no major problem for the parser."]},{"title":"2 Constraint Grammar of English","paragraphs":["A large-scale description has been written within the Constraint Grammar (CG) framework.

For each word, a base form, a part of speech as well as inflectional and also derivational tags are provided, e.g.","(\"<*i>\" (\"i\" <*> ABBR NOM SG) (\"i\" <*> <NonMod> PRON PERS NOM SGI))","(\"<see>\" (\"see\" <SVO> V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN) (\"see\" <SVO> V IMP VFIN) (\"see\" <SVO> Y INF) (\"see\" <SVO> V PRES -SG3 VFIN))","(,,<~>,, (\"a\" <Indef> DET CENTRAL ART SG))","(\"<bird>\" (\"bird\" <SV> V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN) (\"bird\" <SV> V IMP VFIN) (\"bird\" <SV> V INF) (\"bird\" <SV> V PRES -SG3 VFIN) (\"bird\" S NOM SG))"]},{"title":"(,,<$.>,')","paragraphs":["Ambiguities due to part of speech and minor categories are common in English - on an average, the ENGTWOL analyser furnishes each word with two readings. The task of the morphological disambiguev tor is certainly a nontrivial one.","The disambiguator uses a hand-written constraint grammar. Here, we will not go into the technicalities of the CG rule formalism; suffice it to say that each constraint - presently some 1,300 in all - expresses a partial paraphrase of some thirty more general grammar statements, typically in the form of negative restrictions. - For instance, a constraint might reject verb readings in an ambiguous morphological analysis as contextually illegitimate if the immediately preceding word is an unambiguous determiner. This can be regarded as a roundabout partial statement about the form of a noun phrase: a determiner is followed by a premodifier or a noun phrase head, so all morphological readings that cannot act as nominal heads or premodifiers are to be discarded.","Here is the disambiguated representation of the sentence: (\"<*i>\" (\"i\" <*> <NonMod> PRON PERS NOM SGI)) (\"<see>\"","(\"see\" <SVO> V PRES -SG3 VFIN)) (\"<a>\" (\"a\" <Indef> DET CENTRAL ART SG)) ( *'<bird>\"","(\"bird\" N NOM SG))"]},{"title":"(,,<$.>,,)","paragraphs":["Overall, the morphological disambiguator has a very attractive performance. While the best known competitors - typically based on statistical methods (see e.g. [Garside etal., 1987; Church, 1988]) - make a misprediction about part of speech in up to 5% of all words, the ENGCG disambiguator makes a false prediction only in up to 0.3% of all cases [Voutilainen, 1993].

In other words, the generalisations underlying the disambiguation constraints pertain to a higher level of description than is explicitly coded in the input representation.","The high number and also the complexity of most of the constraints mainly results from the fact that direct reference to functional categories is not possible in the constraint grammar because syntactic functions are systematically introduced only after morphological disambiguation has become disactivated. Also explicit information about sentence-internal clause boundaries is missing, so a constraint, usually about clause-internal relations, has to ascertain that the words and features referred to are in the same clause - again in a roundabout and usually partial fashion.","Indeed, it is argued in [Voutilainen, 1993] that if direct reference to all appropriate categories were possible, most or all of part-of-speech disambiguation would be a mere side-effect of genuine functional-syntactic analysis. In other words, it seems that the availability of a more expressive grammatical representation would make part-of-speech analysis easier, even though the amount of ambiguity would increase at the outset.","The ENGCG disambiguator avoids risky predictions; some 3-6~ of all words remain partly ambiguous after part-of-speech disambiguation. Also most of these remaining ambiguities appear structurally resolvable. The reason why these ambiguities are not resolved by the ENGCG disambiguator is that the expression of the pertinent grammar rules as constraints, without direct reference to syntactic-function labels and clause boundaries, becomes prohibitively difficult. Our hypothesis is that also most of the remaining part-of-speech ambiguities could be resolved if also clause boundary and syntactic descriptors were present in the input, even though this would imply more ambiguity at the outset of parsing.","3 First experiences with Finite-State syntax Finite-state syntax, as originally proposed by Koskenniemi, is an emerging framework that has been used in lexicon-based reductionistic parsing. Some nontrivial English grammars of some 150-200 rules have been written recently. The main improvements are the following.","• All three types of structural ambiguity- morphological, clause boundary, and syntactic - are presented in parallel. No separate, potentially sequentially applied subgrammars for morphological disambiguation, clause boundary determination, or syntax proper, are needed - one uniform rule component will suffice for expressing the various aspects of the grammar. In this setting, therefore, a genuine test of the justification of three separate types of grammar is feasible: for instance, it is possible to test, whether morphological disambiguation is reducible to essentially syntactic-functional grammar.","• The internal representation of the sentence is more distinctive. The FS parser represents each sentence reading separately, whereas the CG parser only distinguishes between alternative word readings. Therefore the FS rules need not concern them-selves with more than one unambiguous, though potentially unacceptable, sentence reading at a time, and this improves parsing accuracy.","• The rule formalism is more expressive and flexible than in CG; for instance, the full power of regular expressions is available. The most useful kind of rule appears to be the implication rule; consider the following (somewhat simplified) rule about the distribution of the subject in a finite clause: Subject =>","_ .. FinVerbChain, FinAux ..... NonFinMainVerb ... qUESTION;","It reads: 'A finite clause subject (a constant defined as a regular expression elsewhere in the grammar) occurs before a finite verb chain in the same clause ('..'), or it occurs between a finite auxiliary and a nonfinite main verb in the same clause, and the sentence ends in a question mark.' - If a sentence reading contains a sequence of tags that is accepted by the regular expression"]},{"title":"Subject","paragraphs":["and that is not legitimated by the contexts, the sentence reading is discarded; otherwise it survives the evaluation, perhaps to be discarded by some other grammar rule.","hnplication rules express distributions in a straightforward, positive fashion, and usually they are very compact: several dozens of CG rules that express bits and pieces of the same grammatical phenomenon can usually be expressed with one or two transparent finite-state rules.","• The CG syntax was somewhat shallow. The difference between finite and non-finite clauses was mostly left implicit, and the functional description was not extended to clausal constructions, which also can serve e.g. as subjects and objects. In contrast, even the earlier FS grammars did distinguish between finite and non-finite constructions, although the functional description of these categories was still lacking in several respects. Still, even this modest enrichment of the grammatical representation made it easier to state distributional generalisations, al-396 though much still remained hard to express, e.g. coordination of formally different but functionally similar categories. 3.1 A pilot experiment To test whether the addition of clause boundary and functional-syntactic information made morphological disambiguation easier, a finite-state grammar consisting of some 200 syntactic rules [Koskenniemi et al., 1992] was written, and a test text 4 was selected. The objective was to see, whether those morphological ambiguities that are too hard for the ENGCG disambiguator to resolve can be resolved if a more expressive grammatical description (and a more powerful parsing formalism) is used.","Writing a text-generic comprehensive parsing grammar of a maturity comparable to the ENGCG description would have taken too much time to be practical for this pilot test. While most of the grammar rules were about relatively frequently occur-ring constructions, e.g. about the structure of the finite verb chain or of prepositional phrases, some of the rules were obviously 'inspired' by the test text: the test grammar is more comprehensive on the structural phenomena of the test text than on texts in general. However, all proposed rules were carefully tested against various corpora, e.g. a manually tagged collection of some 2,000 sentences taken from [Quirk et al., 1985], as well as large untagged corpora, in order to ascertain the generality of the proposed rules.","Thus the resulting grammar was 'optimised' in the sense that all syntactic structures of the text were described in the grammar, but not in the sense that the rules would have been true of the test text only.","The test data was first analysed with the ENGCG disambiguator. Out of the 1,400 words, 43 remained ambiguous due to morphological category, and no misanalyses were made. Then the analysed data was enriched with the more' expressive finite-state syntactic description, i.e. with new ambiguities, and this data was then analysed with the finite-state parser. After finite-state parsing, only 3 words remained morphologically ambiguous, with no misanalyses. Thus the introduction of more descriptive elements into the sentence representations made it possible to safely resolve almost all of the remaining 43 morphological ambiguities.","This experiment suggests the usefulness of hav-ing available as much structural information as possible, although undoubtedly some of the additional precision resulted from a more optimal internal representation of the input sentence and from a more expressive rule formalism. Overall, these results seem to contradict certain doubts voiced [Sampson, 1987; Church, 1992] about the usefulness of syntactic knowledge in e.g. part-of-speech disambiguation.","4An article from The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia, consisting of some 1,400 words Part-of-speech disambiguation is essentially syntactic in nature; at least current methods based on lexical probabilities provide a less reliable approximation of correct part-of-speech tagging. 4 A new tagging scheme The above observations suggest that grammar-based analysis of running text is a viable enterprise - not only academically, but even for practical applications. A description that on the one hand avoids introducing systematic structurally unresolvable ambiguities, and, on the other, provides an expressive structural description, will, together with a careful and detailed lexicography and grammar-writing, make for a robust and very accurate parsing system.","The main remaining problem is the shortcomings in the expressiveness of the grammatical representation. The descriptions were somewhat too shallow for conveniently making functional generalisations at higher levels of abstraction; this holds especially for the functional description of non-finite and finite clauses.","This became clear also in connection with the experiment reported in the previous section: although the number of remaining morphological ambiguities was only three, the number of remaining"]},{"title":"syntactic","paragraphs":["ambiguities was considerably higher: of the 64 sentences, 48 (75%) received a single syntactic analysis, 13 sentences (20%) received two analyses, one sentence received three analyses, and two sentences received four analyses.","Here, we sketch a more satisfying notation that has already been manually applied on some 20,000 words of running text from various genres as well as on some 2,000 test sentences from a large grammar [Quirk et al., 1985]. Together, these test corpora serve as a first approximation of the inventory of syntactic structures in written English, and they can be conveniently used in the validation of the new grammar under development. 4.1 Tags in outline The following is a schematic representation of the syntactic tags: SUBJ Subject F-SUBJ Formal subject 0BJ Object F-0BJ Formal object I-OBJ Indirect object SC Subject complement OC Object complement P<< Preposition complement >>P Complement of deferred","preposition APP Apposition @>A QA< AD-A, head follows AD-A, head precedes 397 @>N @>P N< ADVL ADVL/M< Determiner or premodifier Modifier of a PP Postdeterminer or postmodifier Adverbial Adverbial or postmodifier @CC Coordinator @CS Subordinator AUX Auxiliary MV Main verb MAINC mainc Main clause Non-finite verbal fragment n-head Nominal fragment a-head Adverbial fragment","This list represents the tags in a somewhat abstract fashion.

As shown above, non-finiteness is expressed with lower case tags, and finite (and other) constructions are expressed with upper case tags. This kind of splitup makes the grammarian's task easier. For instance, the grammarian might wish to state that a finite clause contains maximally one potentially coordinated subject. Now if potential subjects in non-finite clauses could not be treated separately, it would be more difficult to express the grammar statement as a rule because extra checks for the existence of subjects of non-finite constructions would have to be incorp6rated in the rule as well, at a considerable cost to transparency and perhaps also to generality.

Another problem is that even acquiring collocation matrices based on e.g. four-grams or five-grams requires tagged corpora much larger than the current manually validated tagged ones are. Also, mispredictions, which are a very common problem for statistical analysers, tend to bring in the accumulation effect: more mispredictions are likely to occur at later stages of analysis. Therefore we do not have any reason to use unsure probabilistic information as long as we can use our more reliable linguistic knowledge.","Our rules can be considered as constraints that discard some illegitimate readings. When we apply 401 rules one by one, the number of these readings decreases, and, if possible, in the end we have only one reading left. In addition to the ordinary 'absolute' rules, the grammar can also contain separate 'heuristic' rules, which can be used for ranking remaining multiple readings.","We represent sentences as finite state automata. This makes it possible to store all relevant sentence readings in a compact way. We also compile each grammar rule into a finite state automaton. Each rule automaton can be regarded as a constraint that accepts some readings and rejects some.","For example, consider the subject rule presented in Section 3. We can apply a rule like that on the sentence and, as a result, get an automaton that accepts all the sentence readings that are correct according to the rule. After this, our 1065-ways ambiguous sentence has, say, only some 1045 readings left. This means that in some fractions of a second/\" the number of readings is reduced into a 1/10000000000000000000O0th part. All of these remaining readings are accepted by the applied rule. Next, we can apply another rule, and so on. The following rules will not probably reduce as many ambiguities as the first one, but they will reduce the ambiguity to some 'acceptable' level quite fast. This means that we cannot consider some sentences as unparsable just because they may initially contain a lot of ambiguity (say, 101°° sentence readings).","The real method we use is not as trivial as this, actually. The method presented above can rather be regarded as a declarative approach to applying the rules than as a description of a practical parser. A recent version of the parser combines several methods. First, it decreases the amount of ambiguity with some groups of carefully selected rules, as we described above. Then all other rules are applied together. This method seems [Tapanainen, 1992] to provide a faster parser than more straightforward methods.","Let us consider the different methods. In the first one we intersect a rule automaton with a sentence automaton and then we take another rule automaton that we intersect with the previous intermediate result, and so, on until all (relevant) rules have been applied. This method takes much time as we can see in the following table. The second method is like the first one but the rule automata have been ordered before processing: the most efficient rules are applied first. This ordering seems to make parsing faster. In the third method we process all rules together and the fourth method is the one that is suggested above. The last method is like the fourth one but also extra information is used to direct the parsing. It seems to be quite sufficient for parsing.","Before parsing commences, we can also use two methods for reducing the number of rule automata. Firstly, because the rules are represented as automata, a set of them can be easily combined using intersection of automata during the rule compilation phase. Secondly, typically not all rules are needed in parsing because the rule may be about some category that is not even present in the sentence. We have a quick method for selecting rules in run-time. These optimization techniques improve parsing times considerably. Figure 1: Execution times of parsing methods (sec.).

They were parsed on a Sun SparcSta-tion 2.","The whole parsing scheme can be roughly presented as • Preprocessing (text normalising and sentence boundary detection). • Morphological analysis and enrichment with syntactic and clause boundary ambiguities. • Transform each sentence into a finite state au-","tomaton. • Select the relevant rules for the sentence.","• Intersect a couple of rule groups with the sentence automaton. * Apply all remaining rules in parallel.","• Rank the resulting multiple analyses according to heuristic rules and select the best one if a totally unambiguous result is wanted."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["It seems to us that it is the nature of the grammar rules, rather than the amount of the ambiguity itself, that determines the hardness of ambiguity resolution. It is quite easy to write a grammar that is extremely hard to apply even for simple sentence with a small amount of ambiguity. Therefore parsing problems that come up from using more or less in-complete grammars do not necessarily tell us about parsing text with a comprehensive grammar. Pars-ing problems due to ambiguity seem to dissolve if we have access to a more expressive grammatical representation; witness our experiences with morphological disambiguation using the two approaches discussed above.","We do not need to hesitate to use features that we consider useful in our grammatical description. The amount of ambiguity itself is not what enables or disables parsing. More important is that we have an effective grammar and parser that interact with each other in a sensible way, i.e. we should not try to kill mosquitos with artillery or to move mountains 402"]},{"title":"with a spoon. The ambiguity that is introduced has Lo be relevant for the grammar, not unmotivaLed or structurally unresolvable ambiguity, but ambiguity that provides us with information we need to resolve other ambiguities.
