The input to most of these systems is entered by hand, but some of them, especially those with commonsense domains involving spatial and temporal knowledge, are amenable to interaction by means of a natural language interface. Linguistic access to knowledge about properties such as durations, rates of change, distances, the sizes of the symmetry axes of objects, and so on, is provided by dimensional adjectives (e.g."]},{"title":"long-short","paragraphs":["in the spatial and temporal senses,"]},{"title":"fast-slow, near-far, tall-short).","paragraphs":["In this paper, I will investigate two aspects of their semantics that have an impact on the quality of a KR system with an NL interface. One aspect is the complexity of reasoning entailed by their semantic interpretations. As an example, suppose that we have a text about the in-stallation of new kitchen appliances that contains the following sentences:","(1) a. The refridgerator is about 60 cm wide. b. The cupboard is about as deep as the","refridgerator is wide. c. The kitchen table is about 5 cm longer","than the cupboard is deep. d. The oven is about twice as high as","the table is long.","We may view the relations expressed by these sentences as constraints on the measurements of the object axes (the width of the fridge, the depth of the cupboard, and so on), which are represented as parameters in a constraint system. Then constraint propagation, along with some knowledge about the 348 sizes that are typical for object categories, should allow us to derive the following sentences (among others) from (1):","(2) a. The cupboard is about 60 cm deep. b. The kitchen table is longer than","the refridgerator is wide. c. The kitchen table is short","(for a kitchen table). d. The oven is about 70 cm higher than","the cupboard is deep. e. The oven is high (for an oven).","The inferences from (1) to (2) are rather simple, but reasoning can become very complicated if a large number of parameters and constraints must be accounted for. As we will see below, the computational properties of this kind of reasoning are dependent on the types of relations that appear in the knowledge base. Thus in the present paper, I investigate the kinds of relations that appear in formal theories of the meanings of the following morphosyntactic constructions of dimensional adjectives:","(3) a. Positive The board is long/short.","b. Comparative The board is (6 cm) longer/shorter than the table is wide.","c. Equative The board is (three times) as long as the table is wide.","d. Measurement The board is 50 cm long.","This brings us to the second issue: the compositionality of meaning representations proposed for the sentences in (3). It is appealing from the view-point of theoretical linguistics to regard each of the morphosyntactic categories (positive, etc.) as lexical items with their own semantics, and to assume that the semantics of each sentence in (3) is a compositional function of the semantics of the morphosyntactic category and the semantics Of the adjective stem. Compositional meaning representations may also be computationally more advantageous, since they can be computed very efficiently from syntactic representations (e.g. in unification-based formalisms).","Most formal theories of the meanings of adjectives attempt to fulfill this criterion of compositionality, but as we will see, they differ on a more far-reaching criterion: whether the meaning of the differential comparative (6 cm shorter than) and the equative with factor term (three times as long as) is a compositional function of the meanings the difference and factor terms (6 cm and three times) and the meanings of the simple comparative and equative, respectively. Although compositionality is generally regarded as a virtue in and of itself, some authors ([Pinkal, 1990], [Klein, 1991]) have objected to compositional treat-ments of difference and factor terms on the grounds that they introduce an excessive amount of mathematical structure into our linguistic models.","In section 3, I will compare semantic representations that do and do not foresee a compositional treatment of difference and factor terms by analyzing the complexity of reasoning that they entail. In particular, I will investigate the complexity of constraint propagation in a system where the meaning representations appear as constraints. In this paradigm, uncertain quantitative knowledge is accounted for with real-valued intervals, a popular choice in KR systems, and constraint propagation is performed by the Waltz algorithm (which gets its name from David Waltz [1975]). Ernest Davis [1987] shows in his detailed analysis that the Waltz algorithm is one of the best choices for this task, for reasons that I will explain in section 3.1","It turns out that the constraint propagation with the Waltz algorithm under the compositional approach is more complex; thus, we apparently face a tradeoff between compositionality and complexity. I argue in section 4 that this is indeed a tradeoff, since the non-compositional formation of meaning representations may be expensive, and the increased complexity of the compositional approach may be manageable, especially if certain assumptions can be made about the domain of physical properties being represented."]},{"title":"2 Compositionality in the Semantics of Adjectives","paragraphs":["There is a vast amount of linguistic data on which a formal semantics of adjectives can be evaluated, such as the interaction of comparative and equative complements with scope-bearing operators: quantitiers, logical connectives, modal operators and negative polarity items (e.g. John is taller than I will ever be). A good theory must also account for the phenomenon of markedness, i.e. the semantic asymmetry of the antonyms (see [Lyons, 1977, Sect. 9.1]). However, I will ignore these issues in order to focus on the matter of compositionality. Thus I classify the existing theories of adjective meaning very coarsely as 'compositional' or 'non-compositional'. Note that these labels indicate only whether or not the treatment of difference and factor terms is compositional (in other respects, all of the theories mentioned be-low are compositional).","To begin with, I presuppose a component of dimensional designation that determines which property of an object is described by an adjective, thus","1I have only recently become acquainted with Eero Hyv5nen's \"tolerance propagation\" (TP) approach to constraint propagation over intervals (see [Hyv6nen, 1992]), which in some circumstances can compute solutions that are superior to those of the Waltz algorithm, but at the price of increased complexity.

Moreover, it is not clear whether this approach can capture the duality of 350","For the computational analysis, we will need to classify the relations shown in Tables 1 and 2, since these relations form the input to a knowledge base. But to do so, we must first decide what sorts of entities the difference and factor terms denote. I assume that they do not denote constants, since we may be just as uncertain of their magnitudes as we are of the other magnitudes mentioned in the sentences. Thus it should be possible to treat each of the mini-discourses in (4)-(6) in a similar fashion:","(4) a. The board is 90 to 100 cm long. b. In fact, it is about 95 cm long.","(5) a. The board is longer than the table is wide. b. In fact, it is about 6 cm longer.","(6) a. The board is five to ten times as long as","the table is wide. b. In fact, it is about seven times as long.","The information given in (b) in (4)-(6) can be accounted for by simply modifying the terms introduced in (a). Hence, the difference and factor terms, like the 'amount' terms in Tables 1 and 2, denote uncertain quantities whose magnitude may be constrained by sets of sentences. I will refer to these terms generally as 'parameters'.","With this assumption, we can classify the relations in Tables 1 and 2 as follows:","(7) Non-compositional a. Ordering relations (Positive, Comparative, Equative) b. Linear relations of the form amount(x) + D ~ amount(y) (Differential Comparative) c. Product relations of the form n x amount(x) ~_ amount(y) (Equative with factor term)","(8) Compositional a. Linear relations (Positive, Comparative, Differential Comparative) b. Product relations (Equative with & without factor term) In both approaches, measurements simply serve to identify the degree to which an object exhibits the property in question.","Under the compositional approach, it is possible to assume a single semantic representation in the lexicon for each adjective stem and each morphosyntactic category such that the formulas in Table 2 are generated from those lexical entries. Bierwisch [1989], for example, proposes lexical entries of the following form for each dimensional adjective: ~c~x[amount(p(x) ) = (v :t: c)] comparatives and equatives: Fritz is taller than Hans should be semantically equivalent to Hans is not as tall as Fritz. However, Bierwisch does assume a representation like this for equatives with realized factor terms. where c is a difference value and v is a comparison value (see [nierwisch, 1989] for details).","But the elegance of the compositional approach comes at the price of lexicM semantic representations that include addition and multiplication operators~ which is precisely what Pinkal [1990] and Klein [1991] have criticized: they find the assumption of mathematical operations as basic constituents of lexical meaning uncomfortably strong. This is one of the reasons why Pinkal proposes separate lexical entries for each morphosyntactic form of an adjective.","3 The Complexity of Constraint Propagation The objection to the complexity of the lexical meaning representations required for the compositional approach appeals to intuitions of parsimony, and is in part a matter of philosophical opinion that may be difficult to resolve. Perhaps a decision could be made on the basis of psycholinguistic experimentation, but I will pose a more utilitarian question in this section by examining whether the increase in representational complexity in the transition from Table 1 to Table 2 entails an increase in the computational complexity of reasoning for a knowledge base containing those representations. The reasoning paradigm to be investigated is constraint propagation (sometimes called constraint satisfaction) over real-valued intervals.","Intervals are intended to account for uncertainty in quantitative knowledge. For example, the measurement of a parameter at 20 units on some scale with a possible measurement error of +0.5 units is represented as [19.5, 20.5], to be interpreted as meaning that the unknown measurement value in question lies somewhere in the set {x119.5 <_ x <_ 20.5}. Additional knowledge about the relations that hold between parameters constrains their possible values to smaller sets (hence the term 'constraints' for the propositions in a knowledge base expressing such relations).","Constraint propagation over intervals has been applied in spatial reasoning ([McDermott and Davis, 1984; Davis, 1986; Brooks, 1981; Simmons, 1992]), temporal reasoning (e.g. [Dean, 1987; Allen and Kautz, 1985]) and in systems of qualitative physics (see [Weld and deKleer, 1990; Bobrow, 1985]). Intervals have a very obvious weakness in that the highly precise choice of endpoints can rarely be wellmotivated in natural domains such as these. In particular, the reasoner may draw very different inferences, e.g. about whether two intervals overlap, if the endpoint of some interval is changed by what seems to be an insignificant amount. Thus, as Me.- Dermott and Davis[1984] note, such a system must not only be able to report whether they overlap, but also \"how close\" they come to overlapping. If they do come close ..., then ...[the 351 reasoner] must decide whether to act on the suspect information or work to gather more, which is really the only interesting decision in a case like this. Eventually, when all possible information has been gathered, if things are still close to the borderline then a decision maker must just use some arbitrary criterion to make a decision. We don't see how anyone can escape this. [McDermott and Davis, 1984, p. 114]","A formalism such as fuzzy logic attempts to alleviate the problem of sharp borderlines by using infinitely many intermediate truth values for vague predicates. I happen to have reservations about the adequacy of fuzzy logic for this task 6, but I have chosen to study constraint propagation mainly because its computational properties are well-researched and are attractive for applications in which the potential overprecision of endpoints can be tolerated. Thus it provides a sound basis for comparing the semantic analyses presented in section 2. 3.1 Syntax and Semantics In the following, I briefly review some definitions from [Davis, 1987, Appendix B] (with slight modifications)","Syntax","Assume a set of symbols X = {XI,...,"]},{"title":"X v}","paragraphs":["called parameters.

Constraint propagation separates a stage of assimilation, during which intervals are tightened, from querying, during which the tightened values are reported. It is also possible to infer previously unknown relations between the parameters in the querying stage by in-specting the tightened intervals.

He is not clear on what he means by \"having been through the queue z times\", but I interpret him as meaning that we should stop if any constraint has been taken off the queue more often than p times.

But we can seek empirical evidence by running the algorithm on mixed systems of constraints to see if the time to termination is significantlY greater than the complexity expected for systems containing just the most complex type of relation in the system. If this does not happen for a number of representa-tive systems, we may conjecture that the combina-tion of constraints has not made the problem more complex. The second question can only be answered empirically, by testing whether the heuristic tends to terminate the algorithm too soon (i.e. whether it terminates refinement of systems that might have terminated normally in a short time).","Empirical investigations of these questions are reported in [Simmons, 1993], and described briefly here. To investigate the first question, the algorithm was run on a number of large, consistent constraint systems with admissible solutions in which the three types of constraints shown in Table 3 appeared in approximately equal numbers. On each run, the constraints in the initial queue were permuted randomly to suppress the possible effects of ordering.

If the limit is increased by a constant factor, e.g. if assimilation is stopped after some constraint is processed 2p times, then the risk of early termination is greatly reduced.","In all, the empirical results on the open questions mentioned above have been encouraging. It is an admitted weakness of these tests, however, that they were performed on systems built by hand, not on constraint systems that occur \"naturally\" as part of an NL interface to a KR system. 4 Conclusions The results of the previous section yield Tables 4 and 5 as the complexity of reasoning with the Waltz algorithm under the non-compositional and compositional approaches, respectively. These results de-pend in part on the fact that there is a maximum number of parameters in each constraint in the linguistic application. Measurements are modelled as predicate constraints, i.e. they simply impose interval bounds on some parameter. Intervals are also assumed to model the range of measurement values for the physical property that is typical for members of a category (e.g. the typical width of refridgeratots), thus accounting for the norm used in the interpretation of positives. An important property of such \"norm intervals\" is that they may not be refined, at least not too much. This may be achieved by adding constraints imposing absolute upper and lower bounds on their ranges (cf. [Simmons, 1992]).","Although the worst-case time complexity in all cases turns out to be the same, the compositional approach is more complex for two reasons. First, the system is prone to enter infinite loops under the compositional approach if the starting state is inconsistent, or if the solution is inadmissible.

Second, reasoning under the compositional approach is incomplete in all but the trivial case of measurements, whereas the non-compositional approach guarantees at least assimilation completeness for a subset of the parameters in the system. This means that under the compositional approach, the reasoner does not refine some intervals as tightly as it could have under the non-compositional approach.","These results may be taken as grounds for reject-ing the compositional approach to the semantics of dimensional adjectives in the design of an NL interface to a KR system for quantitative knowledge. However, I do not believe that the compositional approach is contraindicated for all conceivable systems. In addition to the general theoretical appeal of compositional semantics, the compositional formation of meaning representations may be computationally more attractive in some cases (e.g. in unification-based formalisms). Thus if the non-compositional formation of semantic representations turns out to be too expensive, it may defeat the computational advantage gained in the reasoning process.","This is especially true if the weaknesses of the compositional approach do not turn out to be highly relevant in the specific application. For example, if the domain of physical properties being represented is such that a set of constraints requiring some parameter to be set to [0, 0] or [c~, co] is unlikely to be encountered, and hence the solution is likely to be admissible, then the risk of infinite loops is reduced. Moreover, if Davis' heuristic for terminating infinite loops turns out to be reliable (which might be determinable by experimentation within the specific application), then inconsistencies need not be very damaging.","The incompleteness of reasoning under the compositional approach is unacceptable for an application if it is crucial that the inferred intervals contain"]},{"title":"precisely","paragraphs":["those values that are warranted by the constraints and the initial labelling. If a superset of those values can be accepted, however, then the compositional approach can be taken. Both approaches suffer a lack of what Davis calls query completeness: if the value of a term T is to be determined during the querying stage (i.e. after assimilation), 355 the system may return a superset of the values for T that are warranted by the constraints.","Thus an engineer building an NL interface to a system for reasoning about uncertain quantitative knowledge of physical properties must make a number of design decisions:","• How important are difference and factor terms in the linguistic material to be processed? If difference and factor terms are so marginal that they may not occur at all, then the non-compositional approach is probably the better choice, due to its guarantee of termination and assimilation completeness.","• Does the compositional generation of lexical semantic representations have a significant advantage (computational or otherwise) over the non-compositional approach?","• Is it possible or likely for the measurement of some physical property to be exactly zero? While there is probably no natural application in which the magnitude of some property can be infinitely large, there are different philosophies about the treatment of zero. In a system of temporal reasoning, for example, saying that some event has zero duration may be a way of saying that the event does not exist. But another policy might be to insist that no physical property is represented if it is not exhibited to a positive degree. If this assumption can be made, then the intervals [0, 0] and [c¢, oo] are truly inadmissible, and hence one weakness of the compositional approach is diminished.","• Is it important that the precise range of permissible measurement values be inferred for each parameter, or can a superset of those values be useful? If a superset of the possible values is acceptable, then the compositional approach can be chosen. Otherwise, the non-compositional approach must be taken.","By weighing the various answers to these questions, an engineer can stake out a position on the tradeoff and design a system with the power and efficiency most appropriate to his or her needs.
