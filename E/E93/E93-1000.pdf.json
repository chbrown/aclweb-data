The Programme Committee received a large number of submissions (5 page extended abstracts) from all over the world. The general quality of the submissions was high. Out of a total of 229 submissions, 47 were accepted, including 7 reserve papers. Every abstract submitted was reviewed by one member of the Programme Committee and three referees (see pages v and vi). Electronic submission and reviewing procedures helped to speed up this process and turned out not to cause an unreasonable work load at our centre. We trust that the resulting programme offers an inspiring cross-section of excellent work in the field. The programme features invited talks and thematic sessions around two prominent themes in contemporary research: the relations between logic and computational linguistics, and the use of data-oriented methods in CL. The thematic orientation is further developed in the tutorial sessions which are scheduled the days preceding the conference (19-20 April 1993). New elements compared to the predecessors of this conference are a separate student session and a poster and demo session; the reader will find the selected student papers and the poster/demo abstracts at the end of the Proceedings. The programme further includes an information session on infrastructural initiatives in the area of computational linguistics, and the general ACL Meeting. The temporal organisation of the programme is designed to maximize coherence within and diversity across the two parallel sessions. Many people contributed to the preparations of this meeting, and we are happy to thank them: Don and Betty Walker, who promptly replied to our frequent (21366 words) appeals for advice, without which the organisation would have been extremely difficult; Jan van Eijck for organising the tutorials; the 11 members of the Programme Committee and the 93 referees; Johan van Benthem, Ken Church and Ivan Sag for the invited talks; Jeroen Groenendijk and Martin Stokhof, Mark Liberman and Yves Schabes, Leen Torenvliet, and Hans Uszkoreit for giving tutorials; Anne-Marie Mineur and Yvon Wijnen for organising the student sessions (see separate preface); Toon Cohen, Sieb Nooteboom and Peter Schelleman for helpful advice; Erik Aarts, Henny Bekker, Laura Bloksma, Nadine Buenen, Crist-Jan Doedens, Joke Dorrepaal, Maria Florenza, Tertius Groenman, Dirk Heylen, Heleen Hoekstra, Anne-Marie Mineur, Ren6e Pohlmann, Herbert Ruessink, Andr6 Schenk, Koen Versmissen and Jules van Weerden for assistance with local organisation.","Steven Krauwer, Michael Moortgat, Louis des Tombe Conference Chair °.. 111"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The Sixth European Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics was generously supported by Commission of the European Communities (Brussels, Luxemburg) ~ Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (University of","Amsterdam) KNAW, Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences OTS, Research Institute for Language and Speech (Utrecht)","@ SU~I~ Sun Mierosystems Nederland BV, Computerweg 1, Amersfoort (tel 033-501234) TEMPOS (Universities of Amsterdam, Groningen and Utrecht) Utrecht University"]},{"title":"ACL European Chapter Officials","paragraphs":["Chair: Secretary: Treasurer:","Advisory Commitee: Nominating Committee: Ewan Klein, University of Edinburgh Susan Armstrong-Warwick, ISSCO University of Geneva Michael Rosner, n~SIA, Lugano Igor M.

This part of the conference was organized by the Dutch Student Association for Computational Linguistics. The student session differs from the main conference in its emphasis on promising work in progress. For this Student Session we received 34 submissions, 6 of which were accepted. We would like to thank the authors for their submissions. An equally important contribution was made by the Student Programme Committee. Every paper was read by 3 of the 18 student referees, whom we recruited from all over Europe. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to make a well-informed decision about which papers to select. Also we would like to thank the organizers of the main conference, who supported us with their advice and guidance throughout the preparations of the session. We hope future EACL Conferences will continue this initiative for we believe it is of great value for young researchers to get an opportunity to present their work to a large and knowledgeable audience and to exchange ideas with fellow students as well as senior researchers.
