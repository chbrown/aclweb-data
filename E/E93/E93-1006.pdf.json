In this paper we compare DOP with other stochastic grammars in the context of Formal Language Theory.

Since most of these analyses are not perceived as plausible by a human language user, there is a need for distinguishing the plausible parse(s) of an input string from the implausible ones. In stochastic language processing, it is assumed that the most plausible parse of an input string is its most probable parse. Most instantiations of this idea estimate the probability of a parse by assigning application probabilities to context free rewrite roles (Jelinek, 1990), or by assigning combination probabilities to elementary structures (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992). There is some agreement now that context free rewrite rules are not adequate for estimating the probability of a parse, since they cannot capture syntactie/lexical context, and hence cannot describe how the probability of syntactic structures or lexical items depends on that context. In stochastic tree-adjoining grammar (Schabes, 1992), this lack of context-sensitivity is overcome by assigning probabilities to larger structural units. However, it is not always evident which structures should be considered as elementary structures. In (Schabes, 1992) it is proposed to infer a stochastic TAG from a large training corpus using an inside-outside-like iterative algorithm. Data Oriented Parsing fDOP) (Scha, 1990; Bod, 1992a), distinguishes itself from other statistical approaches in that it omits the step of inferring a grammar from a corpus. Instead, an annotated corpus is directly used as a stochastic grammar. An input string is parsed by combining subtrees from the corpus. In this view, every subtree can be considered as an elementary structure. As a consequence, one parse tree can usually be generated by several derivations that involve different subtrees. This leads to a statistics where the probability of a parse is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all its derivations. It is hoped that this approach can accommodate all statistical properties of a language corpus. 37 Let us illustrate DOP with an extremely simple example.

These derivations have different probabilities. Using the corpus as our stochastic grammar, we estimate the probabifity of substituting a certain subtree on a specific node as the probability of selecting this subtree among all subtrees in the corpus that could be substituted on that node. The probability of a derivation can be computed as the product of the probabilities of the subtre~ that are combined. For the example derivations above, this yields: P(Ist example) = 1/20 • 1/4 • 1/4 P(2nd example) = 1/20 • 1/4 • 1/2 P(3rd example) = 2/20 • 1/4 • 1/8 • 1/4 = 1/320 = 1/160 = 1/1280 This example illustrates that a stntigtical language model which defines probabilities over parses by taking into ac~unt only one ,derivation, does not accommodate all statistical properties of a language corpus. Instead, we will defme the probability of a parse as the sum of the probabilities of all its derivations. Finally, the probability of a string is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all its parses. We will show ,hat conventional parsing techniques can be applied to DOP, but that this becomes very inefficient, since the number of derivations of a parse grows exponentially with the length of the input suing. However, we will show that DOP can be parsed in polynomial time by using Monte Carlo techniques. An important advantage of using a corpus for probability calculation, is that no tr0jning of parameters is needed, as is the case for other stochastic grammars (Jelinek et al., 1990; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Schabes, 1992).

In order to discuss this question, we introduce the notion of superstrong equivalence. Two stochastic grammars are called superstrongly equivalent, if they are strongly equivalent (i.e. they generate the same strings with the same trees) and they generate the same probability distribution over the trees. The question as to whether for every DOP-model there exists a strongly equivalent stochastic CFG, is rather trivial, since every subtree can be decomposed into rewrite rules describing exactly every level of constituent structure of that subtree. The question as to whether for every DOP-model there exists a supets¢ongly equivalent stochastic CFG, can also be answered without too much difficulty. We shall give a counter-example, showing that there exists a DOP-model for which there is no superstrongly equivalent stochastic CFG. Proposition It is not the case that/'or every DOP-model there exists a superstrongly equivalent stochastic CFG. Proof Consider the following DOP-model, consisting of a corpus with just one tree.

Thus, Z, i P(t=ti fi'oot(t)=S) = 1 holds. The language generated by this model is {ab*}. Let us consider the probabilities of the parses of the strings a and ab. The parse of siring a can be generated by exactly one derivation: by applying subtree t3. The probability of this parse is hence equal to 1/3. The parse of ab can be generated by two derivations: by applying subtree tl, or by combining subUees t2 and t3. The probability of this parse is equal to the sum of the probabilities of its two derivations, which is equal to P(t=--tl~OOt(t)=S) + P(~t2~oot(t)=S) * P(t=t31root(t)=S)= 1/3 + 1/3,1/3 =4/9. If we now want to construct a superstrongly equivalent stochastic CFG, it should assign the same probabilities to these parses. We will show that this is impossible. A CFG which is strongly equivalent with the DOP-model above, should contain the following rewrite rules. S ~ Sb (1) S --, a (2) There may be other rules as well, but they should not modify the language or slructures generated by the CFG above. Thus, the rewrite rule S --~ A may be 40 added to the rules, as well as A --~ B, whereas the rewrite rule S -o ab may not be added. Our problem is now whether we can assign probabilities to these rules such that the probability of the parse of a equals 1/3, and the probability of the parse of ab equals 4/9. The parse of a can exhaustively be generated by applying rule (2), while the parse of ab can exhaustively be generated by applying rules (1) and (2). Thus the following should hold: P(2) = 1/3 P(1)*P(2) = 4/9 This implies that t)(I),1/3 = 4/9, thus P(1) = 4/9 • 3 = 4/3. This means that the probability of rule (1) should be larger than I, which is not allowed. Thus, we have proved that not for every DOP-model there exists a superstrongly equivalent stochastic CFG. In (Bod, 1992b) superstrong equivalence relations between other stochastic grammars are studied."]},{"title":"4 Monte Carlo Parsing","paragraphs":["It is easy to show that an input string can be parsed with conventional parsing techniques, by applying subtrees instead of rules to the input string (Bod, 1992a). Every subtree t can be seen as a production rule toot(O --, ~ where the non-terminals of the yield of the right hand side constitute the symbols to which new rules/subtrees are applied. Given a polynomial time parsing algoritiun, a derivation of the input string, and hence a parse, can be calculated in polynomial time. But if we calculate the probability of a parse by exhaustively calculating all its derivations, the time complexity becomes exponential, since the number of derivations of a parse of an input string grows exponentially with the length of the input string. Nevertheless, by applying Monte Carlo techniques Crlammersley and Handscomb, 1964), we can estimate the probability of a parse and make its error arbitrarily small in polynomial time. The essence of Monte Carlo is very simple: it estimates a probability distribution of events by taking random samples. The larger the samples we take, the higher the reliability. For DOP this means that, instead of exhaustively calculating all parses with all their derivations, we randomly calculate N parses of an input string (by taking random samples from the subtrees that can be substituted on a specific node in the parsing process). The estimated probability of a certain parse given the input string, is then equal to the number of times that parse occurred normalized with respect to N. We can estimate a probability as accurately as we want by choosing Nas large as we want, since according to the Strong Law of Large Numbers the estimated probability converges to the actual probability. From a classical result of probability theory (Chebyshev's inequality) it follows that the time complexity of achieving a maximum error e is given by O(e'2). Thus the error of probability estimation can be made arbitrarily small in polynomial time - provided that the parsing algorithm is not worse than polynomial. Obviously, probable parses of an input string are more likely to be generated than improbable ones. Thus, in order to estimate the maximum probability parse, it suffices to sample until stability in the top of the parse distribution occurs. The parse which is generated most often is then the maximum probability parse. We now show that the probability that a certain parse is generated by Monte Carlo, is exactly the probability of that parse according to the DOP-model. First, the probability that a subtree t e C is sampled at a certain point in the parsing process (where a non-terminal X is to be substituted) is equal to P( t I root(t) = X ). Secondly, the probability that a certain sequence tl ..... tn of subtrees that constitutes a derivation of a parse T, is sampled, is equal to the product of the conditional probabilities of these subtrees. Finally, the probability that any sequence of subtrees that constitutes a derivation of a certain parse T, is sampled, is equal to the sum of the probabilities that these derivations are sampled. This is the probability that a certain parse T is sampled, which is equivalent to the probability of T according to the DOP-model. We shall call a parser which applies this Monte Carlo technique, a Monte Carlo parser.

Though we cannot make a direct c¢~parison, our pilot experiment suggests that our model may have better performance than a stochastic CFG. However, there is still an error rate of 4%. Although there is no reason to expect 100% accuracy in the absence of any semantic or pragmatic analysis, it seems that the accuracy might be further improved. Three limitations of the current experiments are worth mentioning, Fn~t, the Treebank annotations are not rich enough. Although the Treebank uses a relatively rich part-of-speech system (48 terminal symbols), there are only 15 non-terwinal symbols. Especially the internal su~cmre of noun phrases is very poor. Semantic annotations are completely absent. 42 Secondly, it could be that subtrees which occur only once in the corpus, give bad estimations of their actual probabilities. The question as to whether reestimation techniques would further improve the accuracy, must be considered in future research. Thirdly, it could be that our corpus is not large enough. This brings us to the question as to how much parsing accuracy depends on the size of the corpus. For studying this question, we performed additional experiments with different corpus sizes. Starting with a corpus of only 50 parse trees (randomly chosen from the initial DOP-corpus of 675 trees), we increased its size with intervals of 50. As our test set, we took the same 75 p-o-s sequences as used in the previous experiments.

We restricted ourselves to substitution as the only combination operation between corpus subtrees. A statistical parsing theory was developed, where one parse can be generated by different derivations, and where the probability of a parse is computed as the sum of the probabilities of all its derivations. It was shown that our model cannot always be described by a stochastic CFG. It turned out that the maximum probability parse can be estimated as accurately as desired in polynomial time by using Monte Carlo techniques. The method has been succesfully tested on a set of part-of-speech sequences derived from the ATIS corpus. It turned out that parsing accuracy improved if larger subtrees were used. We would like to extend our experiments to larger corpora, like the Wall Street Journal corpus. This might raise computational problems, since the number of subtrees becomes extremely large. Furthermore, in order to tackle the problem of data sparseness, the possibility of abstracting from corpus data should be included, but statistical models of abstractions of features and categories are not yet available."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The author is very much indebted to Remko Scha for many valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.
