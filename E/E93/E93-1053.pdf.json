A variety of systems have been designed in view of a correspondence as direct as possible with linguistic theory ([Johnson, 1989], [Pollard and Sag, 1991], [Kroch, 1989]). These approaches can be classified by their method of handling global constraints. Global constraints are syntactic in nature: They cover more than one projection. In contrast, local constraints can be checked inside a projection and, thus, lend themselves to a treatment in the lexicon. Conditions on features have been the subject of intensive study and viable logics have been proposed for them (see e.g. the CUF formalism [Dhrre and Eisele, 1991], [Dorna, 1992]). In this paper, we assume such a unification-based mechanism to take care of local conditions and focus on global constraints. One class of approaches to principlebased parsing (see [Pollard and Sag, 1991] for HPSG, [Kroch, 1989] for TAG) attempts to reduce global conditions to local constraints and thus to make them accessible to treatment in a feature framework. This strategy has been pursued only at the expense of sacrificing the precise formulation of the theory and the definitory power stemming from it. The result has been a shift from the structural perspective assumed by GB theory to the object-oriented view taken by unification formalisms. The other class of approaches ([Johnson, 1989]) has allowed the full range of possible restrictions on trees and has in-curred potential undecidability for its parsers. We take up a middle stance on the matter in that we propose a separate logic for global constraints and posit that global constraints only work on ancestor lines (see 7). We assume \"movement\" to be encoded by the kind of gap-threading technique familiar from HPSG, LFG. In order to integrate global constraints a \"state\" (information that serves to express barrier configurations in the part of the tree which has already been built up) is associated with each \"chain\" (information about a moved element). Following H PSG, LFG, we have in mind a rule-based parser. Thus, states are manipulated when rules are chained. We need a calculus that is able to derive global constraints working on a local basis. We begin by developing this calculus hand in hand with an analysis of Chomsky's frame-","*I wish to thank Robin Cooper, Mark Johnson and Esther KSnig-Baumer for comments on earlier versions of this paper. work. We then go on to show that many approaches to barriers theory and a variety of diverse phenomena can be moulded into our format and conclude with an indication of ways to use the system on-line during parsing."]},{"title":"2 Dependencies Between Nodes","paragraphs":["We take a tree T to be a structure (N,>), where N is a set of nodes and > stands for dominance, a binary relation on N.

Thus, adjunction rules imply a distinction between projections and segment nodes that correspond to graph-theoretical nodes. We shall use Greek letters to refer to projection nodes and Latin letters for segment nodes. The only way to create projections covering more than one segment is through adjunction. Since adjunction rules have equivalent mother and daughter nodes, projections are coherent in the sense that: Va ~ fl Vbi, b2 • f~ : a > bi --* a > b2 Chomsky [1986] defines projection dominance so that","dominates ~ only if every segment of a dominates (every segment of) f/.

We understand 7 in (25) and (26) to be a maximal projection, and we understand \"immediately dominate\" in (26a) to be a relation between maximal projections (so that 7 immediately dominates 5 in this sense even if a nonmaximal projection intervenes). Formulation of these definitions in first order logic yields (13--15). In order to obtain an open-ended definition scheme the equivalence of the above definitions is held implicit: Barrier concepts are true iff they comply with a manifest definition (see also 22 and 23).","(13) blocking category(c,b) ¢:: maximal projection(c) A 444 -, L-marked(c) A minimal segment(c) A c>b.","(14) barrier(c,b) maximal projection(c) A minimal segment(c) A 3d : blocking category(d,b) A","c>dA","Ve:c>e>d--+","-, ( maximal projection(e) A","minimal segment(e) ).","(15) barrier(c,b) ¢= blocking category(c,b) A -,IP(c).

CP is no barrier anymore for LF-amalgamated elements since they become wh-movable. We might model amalgamation with the \"nonphantom\" clause of (21).

When search-ing, ancestor lines are either ascended or descended. Accordingly we have to make a distinction between the upward and downward state of dependency information. 446 4.1 Upward States Upward states supply information about barrier nodes encountered on the ancestor line below. They are constructed when the second argument b of a relation R has been found and the tree is being searched for the first argument a. Formally, upward states are sets (standing for conjunctions) associated with some node c and some dependency coming from b. {B,L) e UState(c,b) ~ I(c,b,B,L) Any inheritance clause that can be derived at c on the basis of the lower upward state and the rule schemes (27--28) is included in c's upward state. If a clause is not in the state, it cannot be inferred by (16--18). Consequently, the negation of a missing clause must hold. We assume a counter for c and b to be increased and checked as defined by the theory (computing the number n of passed barriers, see 4). IncreaseCounter(c,b) ~ B(c,b) We use the upward state to break off search as soon as we can infer from the theory that an element a cannot possibly be found in the rest of the tree.

They are computed when the second argument b of a relation tt is being expected because a first argument a has been discovered. Formally, downward states are first order formulae associated with some node c, some ancestor node ct of c, and some dependency leading to b. Atomic formulae of DState(c,cl,b) are inheritance clauses I with respect to c and b. formula E DState(c,ct,b) formula(c,b) ~ IncreaseCounter(cl ,b) The rule schemes (27--28) supply all sufficient and necessary conditions for transfer of inheritance clauses between nodes. Accordingly an atomic formula in the upper downward state can be transformed into a formula holding for the lower node c. False formulae are discarded, while true formulae in-crease the counter. We use downward states to restrict the search space. By (24) we can sometimes infer that search into a subtree will be pointless. Negative inheritance clauses, however, can only be checked when a can-didate for b has been encountered. When the parser descends paths while searching, it always assumes that the current path will dominate b. For upward states, in contrast, the ancestor line of b is fixed. Only downward states scan trees. (26) shows that a state will not change for brother nodes. So we only have to store one downward state per rule (e.g. under its mother node). 4.3 Example Consider the chain of \"how\" in the following example how do [zp. you"]},{"title":"[vP, t [vP","paragraphs":["remember [cp t/*why lip Bill t behaved t ]]]]] In a left-to-right top-down parse, the first barrier to be encountered would be IP* if it dominated either a blocking category (BC) or no other tensed IP. VP* is no BC or barrier since it does not dominate the intermediate trace (it is not the minimal segment of the VP node). CP is L-marked and hence a barrier only if it dominates a BC. If \"why\" excludes a trace in SpecCP, the BC IP occurs between CP and the next trace. Due to the d-role of \"how\", government is violated leading to an ungrammatical sentence. If an intermediate trace is allowed, a new chain is started and no BC occurs. IP refutes the hypothesis that IP* is the deepest embedded tensed IP, and it turns out to be this IP as soon as the variable is found. So only one subjacency barrier occurs: The sentence is grammatical. 5 Conclusion We have described a mechanism that handles global constraints on long movement from a local basis. The device has been derived from a logical formulation of Chomsky's [1986] theory so that equivalence to this theory is easily proved. We have sketched methods to use the logic for early determination of ungrammatical readings in a parser. In my thesis ([Schiehlen, 1992]) the technique has been implemented in an Earley parser that generates all readings in parallel. In this system local conditions are couched into feature terms. Feature clashes lead to creation and abolition of dependencies modelling the GB notion of failed feature assignment and last resource. The barriers logic restricts rule choice for the predictor (descending ancestor lines) and discards analyses in the completer (ascending ancestor lines). Ongoing work is centred around an application of the barriers framework to the generation of semantic structure (Discourse Representation Structure). Kraeht's [1992] approach to analysing barriers theory is related to the one presented here. However, Kracht's emphasis is not so much on parsing. 447"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["Proofs Proof of (6) is trivial. The theorem (7) is symmetric for al and a2. Suppose alRb A \"~a2Rb. a2 and b are unconnected. So there exist kl barriers not dominating al (kl < n) and k2 barriers not dominating a2 (k2 > n). Suppose c is a barrier not dominating a2 but dominating al (there are at least k2-kl > 1 such barriers), c>b and y>b, hence c and y are connected. But y>_c entails y>al. Ifc>y then either x>c>y or c>x. But c>x implies c > a2. To prove (9) note that all barriers for y dominate y by (5). Hence they also dominate a e [y]. We now turn to (10). Take al E [x] and a2 E [y]. a2 and y are not connected. We show that if --c > a2 and c > b then -~c > al. Assume c > b and c > ax. Then x and c are connected both dominating b. We know that -~x _> c > ax. Hence c > x > y. Suppose y! is y's father. Then c > x >_ y! ~.- y and equally c> x > y! ~- a2. We obtain that {c I B(c,b) A -~c> el} D {c I B(c,b) ̂-~c>a2}. Hence -~[x]Rb. We prove (24). Suppose c is a barrier for x. Then by (23) there is a sequence of nodes xl = c and xn > xn+l = x. But xn > x > b, so c is a barrier for b as well. a and y are unconnected. Suppose c is a barrier for y but not x. Then xl = c and xn>x~+l = y. xn and x are connected both dominating y. We know that -~x > xn > y and ~xn > x else c would be a barrier for x. Hence Xn = x and we get x, = x > b. There are at least as many barriers for b as there are for y, so -~aRb. To prove (25) we adopt the argumentation of the foregoing proof and infer that x is a barrier for y. bILz shows that b, x are unconnected, hence -~x > b and -~bRy. (26) follows if we prove B(c, bl) ~ B(c, b2) by induction. The theorem is symmetric. Assume a c such that B(c, bl). Then either scheme (16) holds: L(c) A c>bx hence c>b2. Or (17) and L(c) A 3d : B(d, bl) A c> d A Ve : c> e > d ---* ~L(e). By induction B(d, b2) as well. For the negative scheme (18) we use symmetry to extend the implication I(c, bx, B, L) ---, I(c, b2, B, L) to an equivalence. For (28) we give a proof by cases. Either B(y, b) --. I(z, b, B, L). y is the barrier node d referred to in the consequent. Or I(y, b, B, L) A -~L(y) --* I(x, b, B, L). We set the barrier node d of the first inheritance clause equal to the one of the second. Does a node e between x and d satisfy L? y does not, nor do the nodes between y and d, and there is no node between x and y. But y and e must be connected, both dominating d. We show I(x, b, B, L) --* B(y, b) V I(y, b, B, L). The barrier node d of the antecedent clause and y are connected, both dominating b (see 5). d cannot sit between x and y. If d - y the first disjunct holds. If y > d we set d equal to the barrier node of the second disjunct. No e between y and d satisfies L. We reduce (29) to (10). If a > y > b we make use of (6).
