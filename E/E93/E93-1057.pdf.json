The checker recognizes a word-form if a correct morphological breakdown is allowed. The morphological analysis is based on two-level morphology. The correction method distinguishes between orthographic errors and typographical errors. • Typographical errors (or misstypings) are uncogni-","tive errors which do not follow linguistic criteria. • Orthographic errors are cognitive errors which occur","when the writer does not know or has forgotten the","correct spelling for a word. They are more persistent","because of their cognitive nature, they leave worse","impression and, finally, its treatment is an interest-","ing application for language standardization purposes."]},{"title":"2 Correction Method in Xuxen","paragraphs":["The main problems found in designing the checking/correction strategy were: • Due to the high level of inflection of Basque, it is impossible to store every word-form in a dictionary; therefore, the mainstream checking/correction methods were not suitable. • Because of the recent standardization and widespread dialectal use of Basque, orthographic errors are more likely and therefore their treatment becomes critical. • The word-forms which are generated without linguistic knowledge must be fed into the spelling checker to check whether they are correct or not. In order to face these issues the strategy used is basically the following (see also Figure 1)."]},{"title":"Handling orthographic","paragraphs":["errors The treatment of orthographic errors is based on the parallel use of a two-level subsystem designed to detect misspellings previously typified. This subsystem has two main components: • Additional two-level rules describing the most likely changes that are produced in the orthographic errors.
