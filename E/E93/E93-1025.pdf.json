The treatment does not suffer from problems inherent in identity-of-relations analyses. Furthermore, in contrast to the approach of Dalrymple et al. [1991], the treatment directly encodes the intuitive distinction between full NPs and the referential elements that corefer with them through what we term role linking. The correct predictions for several problematic examples of ellipsis naturally result. Finally, the analysis extends directly to other discourse copying phenomena."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A simple example of verb phrase (VP) ellipsis is given in sentence (1):","(1) John likes his mother, and Bill does too. The stranded auxiliary in the second clause indicates the deletion of a verb phrase, the meaning of which is to be determined from another clause, in this case, the first clause. Following Dalrymple, et al. [1991], we term the clause that the VP is copied from the source clause, and the clause which contains the elided VP the target clause. As is well established in the literature, referential elements 1 in the source clause VP may give rise to strict/sloppy ambiguities","1 For present purposes, we will use the term referential elements as synonymous with pronouns. In Section 5 we discuss how this class may be extended to include implicit arguments as well. in the target clause; for example in sentence (1) the target clause may receive one of two readings, namely one in which Bill likes John's mother (the strict reading), and one in which Bill likes his own mother (the sloppy reading).","In this paper we address the distribution of strict and sloppy readings in VP-ellipsis and other anaphoric phenomena. In Section 2 we discuss problems with past approaches, as well as support our decision to treat ellipsis resolution as a primarily semantic process. In Section 3 we give a representation for events that exhibits what we term role linking between referential elements and their referents, and describe an algorithm for ellipsis resolution that uses this representation. Section 4 demonstrates how use of this representation and algorithm results in the correct analysis of several problematic cases of ellipsis without appeal to additional constraints. In Section 5 we argue that the strict/sloppy distinction is not a property of ellipsis alone, but is instead inherent in what we term the discourse copying process. Several discourse copying phenomena at the event and NP level are shown to be accounted for by our algorithm. We conclude in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Past Approaches","paragraphs":["Much attention has been paid to the ellipsis problem in linguistics (e.g., [Dahl, 1972; Dahl, 1974; Fiengo and May, 1990; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Ha'lk, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Klein, 1987; Lappin, 1992; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977]), as well as in natural language processing (e.g., [Dalrymple et al., 1991; Hardt, 1992; Lappin and McCord, 1990; Priist et al., 1991]). We begin by briefly pointing out several problems with some of these approaches.",".Syntactic accounts of ellipsis (e.g., [Fiengo and May, 1990; Ha'/k, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Lappin, 1992; 203 Lappin and McCord, 1990]) posit the copying of syntactic structure from the source clause representation to the target clause representation. 2 Such accounts fail to explain certain empirical facts. First, an active voice target clause can obtain its representation from a passive voice source clause (and vice versa), but in these cases there is no surface syntactic VP constituent to copy:","(2) A lot of this material can be presented","in a fairly informal fashion, and often I","do. (from text of [Chomsky, 1982])","(3) This problem was to have been looked","into, but obviously nobody did.","(Vincent Della Pietra, in conversation) Second, an elliptical clause can obtain its referent from an event representation evoked into the discourse world by a nominalization:","(4) Meanwhile, they sense a drop in visitors","to the city. Those who do, they say, axe","not taking cabs. (Chicago Tribune,","courtesy Gregory Ward) Third, an elliptical clause may have multiple antecedents:","(5) Mary wants to go to Spain and Fred","wants to go to Peru, but because of limited","resources, only one of them can.","([Webber, 1978])","Several semantic accounts of ellipsis utilizing logical forms have been proposed. Following Dalrymple et at. [1991], we distinguish between identity-of-relations analyses (e.g., [Gawron and Peters, 1990; Klein, 1987; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977]) and nonidentity analyses [Dalrymple et al., 1991]. Identity-of-relations analyses treat source clauses as having ambiguous derivations, with target clauses receiving one such derivation. For example, the source clause in example (1) would have derivations that (at some level) lead to the following two interpretations: John has the property P where:","(6) P = likes John's mother","(7) P = likes his own mother These two properties lead to the same reading for the source clause. However, under an identity-of-relations analysis, if the target receives a strict interpretation, then necessarily (6) is the correct interpretation for the source, whereas if the target receives a sloppy reading, then (7) is necessarily the correct interpretation.","The following example, from Dalai [1972], is termed as n case of cascaded ellipsis in Dalrymple, et al. [1991], and is problematic for identity-of-relations analyses:","2Fiengo and May [Fiengo and May, 1990] actually posit copying of LF representations, but their analysis shares the problems of the syntactic accounts. (8) John realizes that he is a fool, but Billi","does not, even though hisi wife does. An acceptable, and perhaps preferred, reading for (8) is:","(9) John realizes that John is a fool, but","Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool,","even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool.","Example (8) contains two cases of ellipsis; the reading in (9) results from the second clause receiving a sloppy interpretation from the first and the third clause receiving a strict interpretation from the second. An identity-of-relations analysis, however, specifically predicts that the reading given in (9) does not exist. Because the second clause will have the sloppy derivation received from the first, the strict derivation that the third clause requires from the second will not be present.","Dalrymple, et at. [1991] (henceforth DSP) give an account of ellipsis resolution based on an equational analysis utilizing higher-order unification. Unlike identity-of-relations accounts, no unmotivated ambiguity is predicated to exist for VPs with pronouns, instead the ambiguity exists in the resolution process. As a result, reading (9) for sentence (8) is correctly predicted to exist.","We step through DSP's analysis of example (1) to acquaint the reader with their system.

First, they claim that their analysis covers cases of stripping as well as ellipsis. Consider the case of stripping in example (16):","3Strictly speaking, there are four solutions to equation (11). DSP employ a notion of primary occurrence to constrain property derivation to only these two solutions. This point is tangential to our purposes; the interested reader should consult Daltymple et at. [1991].","4The DSP analysis separates the processes of parallel element determination and ellipsis resolution.

The following sections describe the event representation and the resolution algorithm that embody our analysis. 3.1 Event Representation To highlight the general mechanism of our approach we will utilize a simple, Davidsonian-style data structure where events are reified as variables [Davidson, 1967].

Copy remaining empty role fillers from the","source: (a) Identify"]},{"title":"parallel elements,","paragraphs":["i.e., the objects in the source representation corresponding 205 to the empty roles in the target, s","(b) All role fillers may be (i) referred to, where the appropriate function is used to link the role filler to the corresponding object in the source representation. In the case that the role filler is a function with a link to the source event, it may also be (ii) copied, where a new instantiation of the function is created and the source event variable is replaced with its corresponding parallel target event variable.","As with the DSP analysis, this discourse copying method does not assume any ambiguity in the source clause. Ambiguities are generated by the choice given in Step 3b; referring will result in a strict reading and copying will result in a sloppy reading. 4 Treatment of Phenomena We show how our algorithm accounts for a variety of ellipsis phenomena. Section 4:1 illustrates that a basic case of strict and sloppy ambiguity is correctly analyzed. Section 4.2 shows that the algorithm accounts for the cascaded ellipsis case, thereby retaining the advantages of the DSP approach over identity-of-relations anMyses. The remaining subsections show how our algorithm accounts for the cases cited as problematic for DSP in Section 2. Section 5 will then move beyond VP-ellipsis to discuss how related non-elliptical phenomena are accounted for.","4.1 Ellipsis","We consider example (1) again, renumbered as (27): (27) John likes his mother and Bill does too.","The representation for the source clause in (27) is: (28) el: [ predicate: like","agent: John","theme: [obj: mother"]},{"title":"poss: agent(el) ]]","paragraphs":["The parallel event for the target is constructed","(Step 1), and Bill is added as the agent (Step 2): (29) e2: [ predicate:","agent: Bill","theme:] Step 3b can only refer to the value of the predi-","cate role. 7 Since the theme of the source event con-","tains a referential link to the source event itself, Step","eWe follow the DSP analysis in distinguishing the process of determining paxallel elements from the process of performing resolution. For all of the examples considered in this paper, one can assume that parallel elements share the same thematic role in their respective events. The reader is advised to consult Dalrymple et al. [1991] for arguments on why this constraint should be broadened.","7Step 3a of the algorithm as stated requires that a function be used when referring, i.e., technically we should fill the predicate role of e2 with the function predicate(el). To improve readability, when the object 3b allows the theme to either be referred to with a function or copied by creating a new instantiation of the function occupying thetheme and replacing the event variable el with its parallel event variable e2. Referring to the theme role of el yields the strict reading in (30):","(30) e2: [predicate: like agent: Bill theme: theme(el) ] Reading: Bill likes John's mother Conversely, copying the theme role of el yields the","sloppy reading in (31):","(31) eu: [ predicate: like agent: Bill theme: [obj: mother","poss: agent(e2) ] ] Reading: Bill likes Bill's mother Note that if the his in sentence (27) refers to the mother of someone in external discourse, say agent(co), then Step 3b must leave this intact since the link is not to the source event. This correctly yields the only available reading for the target clause in this case. 4.2 Cascaded Ellipsis We show how our analysis accounts for the cascaded ellipsis case discussed in Section 2, repeated below:","(32) John realizes that he is a fool, but Billi does not, even though hisi wife does.","In particular, we work though the derivation of example (32) that leads to reading (33), the reading that is problematic for identity-of-relations analyses:","(33) John realizes that John is a fool, but Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool.","The representation for the first clause in (32) is given in (34):","(34) el: [ predicate: realize agent: John theme: e2: [ predicate: be","agent: agent(el)","be_pred: fool ] ]","The clause represented by (34) is the source for the elided second clause. To obtain the desired reading, Step 3b chooses the copy option to yield the sloppy reading. A new function is instantiated from the function in the agent role of e2, and the event variable el is replaced with its parallel event variable ca: being referred to contains no links to any event, we will opt to reproduce the value in the role of the target representation rather than use a function. 206","(35) es: [predicate: realize polarity: negative agent: Bill theme: e4: [predicate: be","agent: agent(el)","be_pred: fool ] ] Reading: Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool","The clause represented by (35) is the source for the elided third clause.

The representation for the source clause in example (37) is:","(39) el: [predicate: like agent: John theme: [obj: mother","poss: agent(el)]]","To derive a representation for the target clause, we create a parallel event structure (Step 1) and fill in the parallel element representation for Mary (Step 2). The remaining empty role fillers are that for the predicate and agent roles. Since neither contains a link to the source event, Step 3b only has the option of referring to it:","(40) e2: [predicate: like agent: John theme: [obj: mother","poss: Mary"]},{"title":"] ]","paragraphs":["Reading: John likes Mary's mother","SWe omit the feature for polarity when it is positive, as in representation (36).","This yields the correct interpretation for the target clause. Because Mary is parallel to the only element in the source clause that contains a role link in example (37), Step 3b(ii) of the algorithm is never entered. As a result, no ambiguity exists and therefore (40) is the only derivable reading.","4.4 Missing Readings","One might expect that for source VPs which contain","N referring elements, 2 N readings would be possi-","ble. However, Dahl [1974] noticed that the following","example has only three readings, not four: (41) Bill believed that he loved his wife, and","Harry did too.","Out of the expected readings (42a)-(42d), reading","(42d) is missing: (42a) Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's wife. (42b) Harry believed that Harry loved Harry's","wife. (42c) Harry believed that Harry loved Bill's wife. (42d) # Harry believed that Bill loved Harry's","wife. Because he c-commands his in sentence (41), by","rule (26) the pronoun his is linked to the pronoun he","instead of directly to Bill. The event structure for","the source clause in (41) is therefore: (43) el: [ predicate: believe","agent: Bill","theme: e2: [ predicate: love","agent: agent(el)"]},{"title":"theme:","paragraphs":["[obj: wife","poss: agent(e2)]]] We show that the reading in (42d) is correctly predicted not to exist by applying the algorithm to derive all possible readings for the target clause. Step 3b will have two options for each of the role links occupying the agent role of e~ and the poss role of the theme role of e2, resulting in a total of four possibilities. In the first case both objects are referred to, yielding the all-strict reading given in (42a):","(44) el: [predicate: believe","agent: Harry","theme: el: [predicate: love","agent: agent(e2)","theme: theme(e~) ] ]","Reading: Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's wife","In the second case both functions are copied, yielding","the all-sloppy reading given in (42b):","(45) e3: [ predicate: believe","agent: Harry","theme: e4: [predicate: love","agent: agent(e3)","theme: [obj: wife"]},{"title":"po : agent(e4)]]]","paragraphs":["207","Reading: Harry believed that Harry loved","Harry's wife","In the third case the function occupying the agent","role of e2 is copied and the structure occupying the","theme role of eg. is referred to, yielding reading (42c):","(46) ca: [predicate: believe","agent: Harry","theme: e4: [predicate: love","agent: agent(ca)","theme: theme(e~) ] Reading: Harry believed that Harry loved","Bill's wife","These three readings are the acceptable ones for the","target clause in (41). The algorithm also allows for","a fourth possibility in which the function occupying","the agent role of eg. is referred to, and the function","occupying the theme role of e2 is copied: (47) ca: [predicate: believe","agent: Harry","theme: e4: [ predicate: love","agent: agent(e2)","theme: [obj: wife","poss:"]},{"title":"agent(e4)]]]","paragraphs":["Reading: Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's","wife In this case the function agent(e4) returns the value of agent(e2), namely Bill, which again yields the all-strict reading in (42a). Thus, the non-existent reading given in (42d) is not derivable by the algorithm.","This behavior is a result of our choosing to link referential elements to their referents via their roles in the event structures. During the derivation of the representation given in (47), we chose the sloppy option for the second referential element. Instead of replacing the element itself with its parallel element in the event structure as other accounts do, we replaced it with a link to its parallel role in its parallel event. This process was \"sloppy\" in th~ the resulting link is to the agent of e4 instead of to the agent of ez; however, the resulting effect is \"strict\" because the agent of e4 is the same as e2 in this case.","The use of c-command as the linking criterion explains why m~ny speakers get all four expected readings in (48) and (49), which ~re otherwise very similar to (41):","(48) Bill believed that his wife loved him,","and Harry did too.","(49) Bill believed that his wife loved his","brother, and Harry did too. Since neither pronoun c-commands the other in these cases, the event structure for the source clause would have both directly linked to Bill, and the algorithm would derive all four readings for the target clause. Sag [1976] however notes that example (50) only has three readings: (50) Edith said that finding her husband","nude had upset her, and Martha did too. Out of the four possibilities for the target, reading","(51) is missing:","(51) # Martha said that finding Martha's","husband nude had upset Edith.","The algorithm derives only the three correct readings if the first instance of her in sentence (50) is linked to the second. Since neither pronoun c-commands the other, this violates the linking rule. However, as noted by Reinhart [1983] (pp. 179-180), \"experiencing\" verbs such as upset often pose problems for linguistic analyses utilizing c-command. What is required for the linking rule is a notion of a reflexive context that applies to pronouns of all cases (for which c-command is an imperfect approxima-tion). For instance, the NP her husband in sentence (50) is in a reflexive context, i.e., replacing 'her husband' with an accusative pronoun referring to Edith requires the reflexive form: (52) ... finding herselfi/*heri nude had upset her/. Because the her in her husband in sentence (50) is in the reflexive context of the second her, the corresponding role link is required in the event structure. Thus, the algorithm works correctly for example (50); the flaw arises from using c-command in the linking rule to model reflexive contexts. In the future we expect to revise the linking rule by adopting rules superseding c-command for predicting reflexivization. The question of whether our analysis can be considered purely semantic rests on the question of whether reflexivization is syntactically or semantically controlled. 4.5 5-Reading Example DSP discuss the following example (from Gawron and Peters [1990]) as a point of departure among previous analyses:","(53) John revised his paper before the teacher","did, and Bill did too. DSP claim that this sentence has five readings; we agree. The DSP analysis as presented derives six readings. To obtain only the correct five readings, they appeal to the constraint on abstracting over generalized antecedents mentioned in Section 2; however, a precise method for linking elements to generalized antecedents is not given. Our algorithm generates only the correct five readings without appeal to any additional constraints or processes.","The notably absent reading for the third clause in this case is given in (54):","(54) Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper.","We step through the derivation of some of the readings to show that no representation for reading 208 • ?. (54) is derived. 9 We first derive the possible readings for the first ellipsis. The representation for the source clause is:","(55) el: [predicate: revise agent: John theme: [ obj: paper","poss: agent(el) ] ]","We add the temporal modifier, parallel event structure, and role fillers for the representation of the first elided clause:","(56) ex: [predicate: revise","agent: John","theme: [obj: paper","poss: agent(el) ]","time: [relation: before","obj: e2: [predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme:] ] ]","The filler of the theme role in the representation for the source event contains a link to that, so there are two options. First, the theme may be referred to, yielding the strict reading:","(57) el: [ predicate: revise","agent: John","theme: [obj: paper","poss: agent(el) ]","time: [ relation: before","obj: e2: [predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: theme(et)]]] Reading: The teacher revised John's paper","Alternatively, the theme may be copied, yielding the sloppy reading:","(58) el: [predicate: revise","agent: John","theme: [obj: paper poss: agent(el) ]","time: [relation: before obj: e2: [ predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: [ obj: paper","poss: agent(e2)]]] Reading: The teacher revised the teacher's paper","We now consider the readings for the second ellipsis. Unlike the case of cascaded ellipsis, in this example the second ellipsis has the entire conjoined clause as its source. We first consider the readings derived from the strict reading represented in (5?).","9We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out a flaw with a slightly different manifestation of this account in predicting the correct readings for this example. In each of the following derivations event ea is parallel to event el, and event e4 is parallel to e2. After the event and non-referential role information is copied, there are four options. Referring to both of the roles containing links to a source event results in the all-strict reading:"]},{"title":"(59)","paragraphs":["ca: [ predicate: revise agent: Bill theme: theme(et) time: [relation: before","obj: e4: [predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: theme(e~)]]]","Reading: Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised John's paper","In the second possibility, both roles can be copied,","resulting in the all-sloppy reading:","(60) ca: [ predicate: revise agent: Bill theme: [ obj: paper","poss: agent(ca) ] time: [ relation: before","obj: e4: [ predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: theme(ca) ]]]","Reading: Bill revised Bill's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper","Third, the poss role of the theme role of el may be","copied and the theme role of e2 may be referred to:","(61) ca: [ predicate: revise agent: Bill theme: [obj: paper","poss: agent(ez) ] time: [ relation: before","obj: e4: [ predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: theme(e2) ]]]","Reading: Bill revised Bill's paper before the teacher revised John's paper","Finally, the poss role of the theme role of el may","be referred to and the theme role of e2 may be copied:","(62) ca: [ predicate: revise agent: Bill theme: theme(el) time: [ relation: before","obj: e4: [predicate: revise","agent: teacher","theme: theme(ea) ]]] Reading: Bill revised John's paper before the","teacher revised John's paper Note that the reading (62) is the same as the","strict/strict reading in (59). Thus, the algorithm so 209 far has generated three readings and has not generated the non-existent reading (54). We leave it to the reader to determine that when using representation (58) as the source for the final ellipsis, the following two readings are generated:","(63) Bill revised John's paper before","the teacher revised the teacher's paper","(64) Bill revised Bill's paper before","the teacher revised the teacher's paper","The algorithm therefore derives all and only the correct five readings for example (53). Recall that the algorithm's ability to avoid the non-existent reading in the missing reading cases in Section 4.4 was due to our choosing to link referential elements to their referents through their roles in the event structures. In that case, the critical point that implicitly eliminated the missing reading occurred during a derivation where the sloppy option was chosen. The ability of the algorithm to avoid generating the missing reading given in sentence (54) is also due to our role linking scheme, but in this case the crucial step was in choosing the strict option in the derivation of the first ellipsis (which resulted in representation (57)). Because the algorithm referred to the theme of el through its role instead of replicating it, the representation for the non-existent reading could not be derived during the resolution of the second ellipsis. In either case, accounts that rely on parallel elements cannot avoid these readings without appeal to additional constraints. Our analysis requires no such constraints; the correct readings naturally result from the mechanism itself. 5"]},{"title":"Beyond Ellipsis","paragraphs":["The hallmark of the discourse copying process is the need not only to refer to a previously mentioned entity or event, but to create a new instantiation of it. VP-ellipsis is one such process; the meaning of the source clause serves as both the referent and the object from which a new, more general instantiation is created. Here we claim that the strict/sloppy distinction is an inherent property of the discourse copying process, and therefore not of VP-ellipsis resolution alone. Our algorithm is directly applicable to a wide variety of discourse copying phenomena at both the VP and NP levels.","All of the following reference phenomena require discourse copying, and therefore exhibit strict/sloppy ambiguities:","• VP-ellipsis: John likes his mother, and Bill does","too.","• Pronominal Event Anaphora: John got shot by","his father.

Most men forget this important date.","• 'Lazy' Pronouns: The man who gives his paycheck to his wife is wiser than the man who spends it. ([Karttunen, 1969])","We make a distinction between the processes of determining when discourse copying applies and performing the resolution. We show how the representations of some of these examples are resolved by our algorithm.","The pronouns it and that can be used to refer to events. Usage such as that in example (65) requires discourse copying since a new instantiation of an existing event needs to be applied to the target representation:","(65) John got shot by his father. That happened to Bill too. That is, both (66) and (67) are possible readings for"]},{"title":"(65):","paragraphs":["(66) Bill was shot by John's father.

The representation for the source clause is:","(68) el: [ predicate: shot agent: [ obj: father","poss: theme(el) ] theme: John ]","Assuming that Bill is the theme of the target event, referring to the agent role yields the representation for the strict reading in (69), and copying it yields the representation for the sloppy reading in (70):","(69) e2: [ predicate: shot agent: agent(el) theme: Bill ] Reading: Bill was shot by John's father","(70) e2: [ predicate: shot agent: [ obj: father","poss: theme(e~) ] theme: Bill ] Reading: Bill was shot by Bill's father","Dalai [1972] gives similar examples involving a form of definite event reference: 210","(71) John thinks he is smart, and Bill suffers from the same delusion.","(72) John kissed his wife.

The cases involving definite NPs and lazy pro-","nouns can be handled in an analogous fashion to","'one'-anaphora. However, whereas 'one'-anaphora by","its nature involves discourse copying, the contexts in","which definite NPs and pronouns can copy as well","1°Obtaining the sloppy reading may be aided by considering a relevant context, such as one where John's and Bill's families are on vacation together. as refer are more limited. Therefore, the challenge in handling these latter cases is in determining when discourse copying is licensed.","As a final note, we point out that the class of what we have termed referential elements can be extended to include implicit arguments as well as pronouns. For instance, consider examples (78) and (79), adapted from Partee [1989]:","(78) John went to a local bar to watch","the Superbowl, and Bob did too.","(79) George drove to the nearest hospital,","and Fred did too.","In sentence (78), local has an implicit argument that is linked to John, likewise for nearest and George in sentence (79). In each case there are strict and sloppy readings for the target clause; e.g., the target in example (78) can mean that Bob went to the bar local to John, or a bar local to himself. As is the case with pronouns, if the implicit argument is instead linked to external discourse (e.g., \"local\" interpreted as being to the speaker instead of to John in sentence (78)), then there is only one reading for the target; no sloppy reading exists.","Nominalizations can also contain implicit arguments that give rise to strict and sloppy readings, as in example (80):","(80) The CS500 final exam is tomorrow.","John fears failure and his brother does too. Assuming that John fears his own failure, then John's brother may either fear John's failure or his own failure. Our algorithm readily handles these cases with the appropriate role linking of implicit arguments.","Not included in the class of referential elements are empty pronouns within infinitival clauses; these do not give rise to strict readings. For example, in (81)","(81) John wants to leave, and Bill does too. there is only a sloppy reading for the target; it cannot be taken to mean that Bill wants John to leave. In our algorithm, the representation for empty pronouns will always have to be copied. 6 Summary We have given an analysis of ellipsis resolution in terms of a straightforward discourse copying algorithm that correctly predicts a wide range of phenomena. The treatment does not suffer from problems inherent in identity-of-relations analyses. Furthermore, in contrast to the approach of Dalrymple et al. [1991], the treatment directly encodes the intuitive distinction between full NPs and the referential elements that eorefer with them, thus allowing the correct analysis of the stripping example. Furthermore, we establish this distinction via the role linking scheme we have defined, which also allows 211 the correct predictions in the missing readings and 5-readings cases to come as a natural result. Finally, the analysis extends directly to other discourse copying phenomena. Future work includes extending the analysis to interact with quantificational phenomena.
