Box 4079, 1009 AB Amsterdam, The Netherlands Abstract","paragraphs":["The dynamic interpretation of a formula as a binary relation (inducing transitions) on states is extended by alternative treatments of implication, universal quantification, negation and disjunction that are more \"dynamic\" (in a precise sense) than the usual reductions to tests from quantified dynamic logic (which, nonetheless, can be recovered from the new connectives). An analysis of the \"donkey\" sentence followed by the assertion \"It will kick back\" is provided. 1 Introduction The line If a farmer owns a donkey he beats it (1) from Geach [6] is often cited as one of the success stories of the so-called \"dynamic\" approach to natural language semantics (by which is meant Kamp [12], Heim [9], Sarwise [1], and Groenendijk and Stokhof [7], among others). But add the note It will kick back (2) and the picture turns sour: processing (1) may leave no beaten donkey active. Accordingly, providing a referent for the pronoun it in (2) would appear to call for some non-compositional surgery (that may upset many a squeamish linguist). The present paper offers, as a preventive, a \"dynamic\" form of implication =~ applied to (1). Based on a \"constructive\" conception of discourse analysis, an overhaul of Groenendijk and Stokhof [7]'s Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPI.) is suggested, although :=~ can also be introduced less destructively so as to extend DPL conservatively. Thus, the reader who prefers the old \"static\" interpretation of (1) can still make that choice, and declare the continuation (2) to be \"semantically ill-formed.\" On the other hand, Groenendijk and Stokhof [7] themselves concede that \"at least in certain contexts, we need alternative externally dynamic interpretations of universal quantification, implication and negation; a both internally and externally dynamic treatment of disjunction.\" A proposal for such connectives is made below, extending the dynamic interpretation in a manner analogous to the extension of classical logic by constructive logic (with its richer collection of primitive connectives), through a certain conjunctive notion of parallelism.","To put the problem in a somewhat general perspective, let us step back a bit and note that in assigning a natural language utterance a meaning, it is convenient to isolate an intermediate notion of (say) a formula. By taking for granted a translation of the utterance to a formula, certain complexities in natural language can be abstracted away, and semantics can be understood rigorously as a map from formulas to meanings. Characteristic of the dynamic approach mentioned above is the identification of the meaning of a formula A with a binary relation on states (or contexts) describing transitions A induces, rather than with a set of states validating A. In the present paper, formulas are given by first-order formulas, and the target binary relations given by programs.

Now, part of the computational intuition underlying dynamic logic is that at any point in time, a state (i.e., valuation) embodies all that is relevant about the past to what can happen in the future.

Furthermore, for applications to natural language discourse, forgetfulness would appear quite innocuous if the information content of a state increases in the course of interpreting discourse (so that all past states have no more information content than has the current state). And it is quite natural in discourse analysis to assume that information does grow.","Consider the following claim in an early paper","(Karttunen [13]) pre-occupied with a problem (viz.,","that of presuppositions) that may appear peripheral","to (1) or (2), but is nonetheless fundamental to the","\"constructive\" outlook on which =¢, is based There are definitions of pragmatic presupposition ... which suggest that there is something amiss in a discourse that does not proceed in [an] ideal orderly fashion .... All things considered, this is an unreasonable view .... People do make leaps and shortcuts by using sentences whose presuppositions are not satisfied in the conversational context. This is the rule rather than the exception, and we should not base our notion of presupposition on the false premiss that it does not or should not happen. But granting that ordinary discourse is not always fully explicit in the above sense, I think we can maintain that a sentence is always taken to be an increment to a conte~:t that satisfies its presuppositions. [p. 191, italics added] To bring out an important dimension of \"increment to a context\", and at the same time get around the destruction of information in DPL by a random assignment, we will modify the translation .DPI. (mapping first-order formulas into programs) slightly into a translation .~, over which (P2) will be worked out (though the reader should afterwards have no difficulty carrying out the similar extension to DPI.). The modification is based (following Fernando [4], and, further back, Barwise [1]) on (i) a switch from valuations defined on all variables to valuations defined on only finitely many variables, and on (ii) the use of guarded assignments x := * (in place of random assignments), given by =z? + -~(z=z?); ~:=?, which has the effect of assigning a value to x precisely when initially z is unbound (in which ease the test z = z? fails).

But if reduc-ing dynamic semantics to static truth conditions is to complete that circle, then formulas must first be translated to programs. And that step ought not to be taken completely for granted (or else why bother talking about \"dynamic semantics\"). Understanding a computer program in a precise (say \"mathematical\") sense is, in principle, to be expected insofar as the states through which the computer program evolves can be examined. If a program can be implemented in a machine, then it has a well-defined operational semantics that, moreover, is subject (in some sense or another) to Church's thesis.

Strong negation ,~ is, from this standpoint, a mild improvement, but it would appear that the situation for implication has only been made more complicated. This complication can be seen, how-ever, as only a first step towards getting a handle on the computational character of the programs used in interpreting formulas dynamically. Whether more effective forms of realizability (incorporating, as was 136 originally conceived, some notion of construction or proof into the witnessing by functions) can shed any helpful light on the idea of dynamic semantics is an open question. That realizability should, crazily enough, have anything to say whatsoever about a linguistic problem might hearten those of us inclined to investigate the matter. (Of course, one might take the easy way out, and simply restrict =~ to finite models.)","Making certain features explicit that are typically buried in classical logic (such as the witness to the V3-clause in ::~) is a characteristic practice of constructive mathematics that just might prove fruitful in natural language semantics. A feature that would seem particularly relevant to the intuition that discourse interpretation amounts to the construction of a context is information growth. 9 The extension of the domain of a finite valuation is an important aspect of that growth (as shown in Fernando [4], appealing to Henkin witnesses, back-and-forth constructions, ...). The custom in dynamic logic of reducing a finite valuation to the set of its total extensions (relative to which a static notion of truth is then defined) would appear to run roughshod over this feature -- a feature carefully employed above to draw a distinction between establishing and testing a formula (mentioned back at the end of section 3).","But returning to the dynamic implication ::~ introduced above, observe that beyond the loss of structure (and information) in the step from (P1) to (P2), it is possible within (P2) (or, for that matter, within (P1)) to approximate =~ by more modest extensions. There is, for instance, the translation -,~,,~ • (not to be confused with -----) which (in general) abstracts away structure with each application. The interpretation of implication can be simplified further by not-ing that --Tr can be recovered as ~r =V .1_, and thus the static implication D of DPI. can be derived from ::~. Reflecting on these simplifications, it is natural to ask what structure can dynamic semantics afford to forget?"]},{"title":"Is there more structure lurking behind construction than concerns truth?","paragraphs":["With the benefit of the discussion above about the dual (establishing/testing) nature of asserting a proposition -- or perhaps even without being subjected to all that babble --, surely we can agree that"]},{"title":"Story-telling requires","paragraphs":["more"]},{"title":"imagination than verifying facts.","paragraphs":["9The idea that information grows during the run of a typical computer program is, by comparison, not so clear.
