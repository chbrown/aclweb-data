First, a family of algebras corresponding to different versions of grid and bracketed grid theory is introduced. It is subsequently shown in what way bracketed grid theory differs from metrical theories using trees. Finally, we show that there are no significant differences between the formalism of bracketed grids (for metrical structure) and the representation used in the work of [Kaye, et al., 1985], [1990] for subsyllabic structure."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The most well-known characteristic of Non-linear Phonology is that it shifted its attention from the theory of rules (like in [Chomsky and Halle, 1968]) to the theory of representations. During the last decade phonologists have developed a theory of representations that is sufficiently rich and adequate to describe a wide range of facts from the phonologies of various languages.","It is a fairly recent development that these representations are being studied also from a purely formal point of view. There has been done some work on autosegmental structure (for instance [Coleman and Local, 1991; Bird, 1990; Bird and Klein, 1990]) and also some work on metrical trees (like [Coleman, 1990; Coleman, 1992] in unification phonology and [Wheeler, 1981; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991] in categorial logics). As far as I know, apart from the pioneering work by [Halle and Vergnaud, 1987], hitherto no attention has been paid to the formal aspects of the most popular framework of metrical phonolog~y nowadays, the bracketed grids framework.","Yet a lot of questions have to be answered with regard to bracketed grids. First of all, some authors (for instance [Van der Hulst, 1991]) have expressed the intuition that bracketed grids and tree structures (e.g. the [sw] labeled trees of [Hayes, 1981] and related work) are equivalent. In this paper, I study this intuition in some formal detail and show that it is wrong.","Secondly, one can wonder what the exact relation is between higher-order metrical structure (foot, word) and subsyllabic structure. In this paper I will show that apart from a fewempirically unimportant details, bracketed grids are equivalent to the kind of subsyllabic structure that is advocated by [Kaye, et al., 1985], [1990] t."]},{"title":"2 The definition of a bracketed grid","paragraphs":["Below I give a formal definition of the bracketed grid, as it is introduced by HV and subsequently elaborated and revised by these authors and others, most notably [Hayes, 1991]. HV have a major part of their book devoted to the formalism themselves, but there are numerous problems with this formalization. I will mention two of them.","First, their formalization is not flexible enough to capture all instances of (bracketed) grid theory as it is actually used in the literature of the last few years. They merely give a sketch of the specific implementation of bracketed grid theory as it is used in the rest of their book. Modern work like [Kager, 1989] or [Hayes, 1991] cannot be described within","1In this paper, I will use HV as an abbreviation for [Halle and Vergnaud, 1987] and KLV as an abbreviation for [Kaye, et al., 19851, [1990]. 322 this framework.","Secondly, their way of formalizing bracketing grids has very much a 'derivational' flavour. They are more interested in how grids can be built than in what they look like. Although looking at the derivational aspects is an interesting and worthwile enterprise in itself, it makes their formalism less suitable for a comparison with metrical trees. A grid in the linguistic literature is a set of lines, each line defining a certain subgroup of the stress bearing elements. Thus, in 1 (HV's (85)), the as-terisks ('stars') on line 0 represent the syllables of the word formaldehyde, the stars on line 1 secondary stress and line 2 represents the syllable with primary stress:","(1) (. *) line 2 (*) (* .) (*) line 1 for mal de hyde We can formalize the underlying notion of a line as follows: Definition 1 (Line) A line Liis a pair < At, -'4i> where Ai = {a~,...,a?}, where a~,...,a n are constants, n a fixed number -~i is a total ordering on Ai such that the following axioms hold. a. Vot, 13, 7 ELi : ot ~i 13 A 13 ~i 7 ~\" ot -41 7 (transitivity) b. Vow,"]},{"title":"13 ELi","paragraphs":[": a -4i"]},{"title":"13 ::~ -'(13","paragraphs":["\"~i a) (asymmetry) c. Va G Li : ~(a -41 a) Orreflezivity) We say that Li C Lj if Ai C A#, a ELi if a E At. Other set theoretic expressions are extended in a like-wise fashion. Yet this formalisation is not complete for bracketed grids. It has to be supplemented by a theory about the brackets that appear on each line, i.e. by a theory of constituency and by a theory of what exactly counts as a star on a given line.","We have exactly one dot on top of each column of stars2.Moreover, each constituent on a line has one star in it plus zero, one or more dots. The stars are heads. HV say that these heads govern their complements. This government relation can only be a relation which is defined in terms of precedence. Suppose we make this government relation into the primitive notion instead of the constituent. A metrical line is defined as a line plus a government relation on that line: Definition 2 (Metrical line) A metrical line MLi is a pair <Li,P~>, where Li is a line Ri is a relation on Li and an element of {-~i,>-i,--,i , ~-'i, '~i}","ZThat is, if we follow the current tradition rather than HV. With the following definitions holding3: Definition 3 (Precedence Relations) a Ni 13 ¢~ We assume that something like Government Requirement 1 holds, just as it is assumed in HV that every element is in a constituent, modulo extrametricality (which we will ignore here). Government Requirement 1 (to be revised below) A line Limeets the government requirement iff all dots on Li are governed, i.e. a star is in relation Ri to them. Now a constituent can be defined as the domain that includes a star, plus all the dots that are governed by this star. We have to be a little bit careful here, because we want to make sure that there is only one star in each constituent.","In a structure like the following we do not want to say that the appointed dot is governed by the first star. It is governed by the second star, which is nearer to it:"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["*...*..."]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["In order to ensure this, we adopt an idea from modern GB syntax, viz. Minimality, which informally says that an element is only governed by another element if there is no closer governor. The definition of Phonological Minimality could look as follows: Definition 4 (phonological government) aGi# (a governs 13 on line i) iff a is a star and art13 A -~37, 7 a star : [7R/13 A aR/7] We will give the formal definition of a star later on in this chapter. The government requirement is now to be slightly modified. Government Requirement 2 to be revised below A line Limeets the government requirement iff all dots on Li are governed, i.e. a star in Liis in relation Gi to them. We can now formally define the notion of a constituent 4.","aActually, HV also use a fifth kind of constituent in their book, viz. one of the form (. * .). Because there has been a lot of criticism in the literature against this type of government, I will not not discuss it here.","4The reviewer of the abstract for EACL notices that under the present definitions it is not possible to express the kind of ambiguity that is current in (parts of) bracketed grid literature, where it is not sharply defined whether a dot is governed by the star to its left or by the star to its right. This is correct. It is my present purpose to define a version of bracketed grids that comes closest to trees because only in this way we can see which are the really essential differences between the two formalisms. 323 Definition 5 (Constituent) A constituent on a line Li is a set, consisting of exactly one star S in Li plus all elements that are not stars but that are governed by S.","We now have a satisfying definition of a metrical line. We can define a grid as a collection of metrical lines, plus an ordering relation on them: Definition 6 (Grid) A grid G is a pair < £, 1>, where £ = {L1 .... , Ln}, where LI, ..., L, are metrical lines I is a total ordering on £, such that VLi, Lj • £ : Li I L1 ¢~ [Li C Lj A Va,~3 • Li fl Lj : [a -~i Z ¢~","8]] where C is intended to denote the proper subset relation, so Li C L 1 ~ \",(Li = Li). It is relatively easy to see that I by this definition is transitive, asymmetric and irreflexive. We also define the inverse operator T such that Li T L 1 iff Lj ILi.","The most interesting part of definition 6 is of course the 1 ('above')-relation. Look at the grid in (3) (= HV's (77), p. 262):","(3) line 3 (. .) line 2 (. .) (.) line 1 Ten ne see Each of the lines in this grid is shorter than the one immediately below it, in that it has fewer elements. This follows from elementary pretheoretical reasoning. Every stressed syllable is a syllable, every syllable with primary stress also has secondary stress. We expressed this in definition 6 by stating that every line is a subset of the lines below it. By this statement we also expressed the idea that the elements represented on the higher line are in fact the same things as those represented on the lower lines, not just features connected of these. The second part of the definition says that the relative ordering of the elements in each line is the same as that on the other lines.","Our present definition of a metrical grid already has some nice properties. For example, the Continuous Column Constraint, which plays a crucial role as an independent stipulation in [Hayes, 1991] can be derived from definition 6 as a theorem:","(4) Continuous Column Constraint (CCC): A grid containing a column with a mark on layer (=our metrical line) n+l and no mark on layer n is ill-formed. Phonological rules are blocked when they would create such a configuration. The CCC excludes grids like (5), where b is present on the third line, but not on the second.","(5) a b a c d abed We can formalize the CCC as a theorem in our system:","Theorem 1 (CCC)VaVLiLj : (a E Li ALi ]. e Proof of theorem 1 Suppose a E Li, suppose Li I Lj.

We want to introduce an extra requirement on grids. Nothing in our present definition excludes grids consisting of infinitely many lines. However, in our linguistic analyses we only consider finite construetions. We need to express this. First, we define the notions of a top line and a bottom line. Then we say that a finite grid always has one of each. Definition 8 (Top line and bottom line) For a certain grid G, VLi E G (LToP, G = Li)d--efVLj E G : [(Li = Lj) V (Li ~ Lj)]","(LBoTTOM,G -\" LI)~'~fVLj • G : [(ni = Lj)V(Lj 1","Li)] Definition 9 (Finite grid) A grid G is called a finite grid if 3Li • G: [Li= LTOP, G] A 3Lj • G : [L i = LBoTTOM,e] Note that we have to say something special with regard to the government relation in LTOP, G. By definition, this line has only dots in it, so it always looks as something like (6). (6) ....... There can be no star on this level. A star by definition has to be present at some higher line and there is no higher line above LTOP, G. This means that the LTOP, G can never be meeting the government 324 requirement and that in turn means that no linguistic grid can ever meet the government requirement. In order to avoid this rather unfortunate situation, we have to slightly revise the definition of meeting the government requirement for linguistic grids. Government P~quirement 5 (for grids) -- final version A grid G meets the government relation iff all the lines Li E G - {LTop, a} meet the government requirement. Definition 10 (Linguistic grid) A linguistic grid is a finite grid which meets the government relation A last definition may be needed here. If we look at the grids that axe actually used in linguistic theory, it seems that there is always one line in which there is just one element. Furthermore, this line is the top line (the only line that could be above it would be an empty line, but that one doesn't seem to have any linguistic significance).","This observation is phrased in [Hayes, 1991] as follows: if prominence relations are obligatorily defined on all levels, then no matter how many grid levels there are, there will be a topmost level with just one grid mark.","We can formalize this ~s follows: Definition 11 (Complete linguistic grids) A linguistic grid G is called a complete linguistic grid iff [LToP, G] = 1, i.e. 3a : [a E LTOP, G A Vfl : L 8 e LTOP, G ::~ # ---- O~]] We call this type of grid complete because we can easily construct a complete linguistic grid out of every linguistic grid.","If LTOP, G is non-empty, we construct a complete grid by projecting the rightmost (or alternatively the leftmost) element to a new line L/and by adding the government requirement ~- (or -4) to LTOP, G. Finally we add the relation Lil LTOP, G to the grid, i.e. we make Lito the new LTOP, G.","If the top line of the grid is empty, we remove this line from the grid and proceed as above. Most linguistic grids that are known from the literature, are complete.","Some authors impose even more restrictions on their grids. I believe most of those claims can be expressed in the formal language developed in this section. One example is [Kager, 1989], who claims that all phonological constituents are binary. This Binary Constituency Hypothesis can be formulated by replacing definition 2: Definition 12 A metrical line MLI is a pair < Li,Ri>, where Li is a line Ri is a relation on Li and an element of {~i, ~i}"]},{"title":"3 Grids and trees","paragraphs":["In this section, we will try to see in how much bracketed grids and trees are really different formal systerns, i.e. to what extent one can say things in one formalism that are impossible to state in the other.","First recall the standard definition of a tree (we cite from [Partee et al., 1990])5: Definition 13 (Tree) A (constituent structure) tree is a mathematical configuration < N, Q, D, P, L >, where N is a finite set, the set of nodes Q is a finite set, the set of labels D is a weak partial order in N × N, the dominance relation P is a strict partial order in N x N, the precedence relation L is a function from N into Q, the labeling function and such that the following conditions hold: (a) 3a E N : V/~ G N : [<a,/~>E O] (Single root","condition)"]},{"title":"(b) W,a ~ N : [(<~,~>~ PV <a,~>E P)","paragraphs":["¢* (< a,/~ >¢ D̂</~, a >¢ D)] (Exclusivity condition)","(c) Va,~,7,6 : [(< ot,/~ >E PA < a,7 >E DA < 8, 6 >E D) ~< 7, 6 >E P] (Nontangling condition) It is clear that bracketed grids and trees have structures which cannot be compared immediately. Bracketed grids are pairs consisting of a set of complex objects (the lines) and one total ordering relation defined on those objects (the above relation). Trees on the other hand are sets of simple objects (the nodes) with two relations defined on them (dominance and precedence). These simply appear to be two different algebra's where no isomorphism can be defined.","Yet if we decompose the algebraic structure of the lines, we see that there we have sets of simple objects (the elements of the line) plus two relations defined on them. One of those relations ('~i) is a strict partial order, just like P. The other relation, Gi, vaguely reminds us of dominance.","Yet a line clearly is not a tree. Although -4i has the right properties, it is not so sure that Gi does.

Interestingly, [Ewen, 1986] analyses English stress shift, one of the main empirical motivations behind the grid formalism, with subjunction. In [Van Oostendorp, 1992b] I argue that using subjunction Ewen's way actually means an introduction of lines into Dependency Phonology."]},{"title":"5 Government Phonology","paragraphs":["Now let us turn over to a well-known phonological theory that also employs the notion of government as well as 'autosegmental representations'. I refer of course to the syllable theory of KLV and [Charette, 1991].","This theory of the syllable in fact does not have a syllable constituent at all. In stead of such a constituent, KLV postulate a line of x-slots and paralelly, a tier of representation which conforms to the pattern (0 R)* - that is an arbitrary number of repetitions of the pattern OR.(KLV [1990]) The term 'tier' suggests an autosegmental rather than a metrical (bracketed grid) approach to syllable structure, but KLV are never explicit on this point.","The fact that O and R appear in a strictly regular pattern can be explained either by invoking the (metrical) Perfect Grid requirement or, alternatively, the 328 (autosegmental) OCP. The same applies to the 'labels' O and R: we can define them autosegmentally as the two values of a type 'syllabic constituent' or in-directly as notational conventions for stars and dots on a 'syllable line', i.e. we could have the following representations for KLV's (O R)* line:","(14) a. tier:. [type: syll.const; vMue: O;...] [type: syll. coast; v~lue: R;... ], etc.","b. line: *, etc.","For (14b), we would have to show that the rhymes or nuclei project to some higher line. We will return to this below.","We still cannot really decide between an autosegmental and a metrical approach. If we look at more than one single line, this situation changes.","At first sight, it then seems very clear that KLV's syllables act as ARs, not as grids. For instance, we can have representations like (15) (from [Charette, 1991]), with a floating Onset constituent:","(15) Ort O R"]},{"title":"I I I","paragraphs":["X X X"]},{"title":"I I I","paragraphs":["a m 1","This is a possible autosegmental chart, but not a possible grid (because the Complex Column Constraint is violated by the word initial onset). However, empirical motivation for (15) is hard to find. As far as I know, the structure of (15) is motivated only by the assumption that on the syllabic line we should find (OR)* sequences rather than, say, (R)(OR)*.","The same state of poor motivation does not hold, however, to the representation [Charette, 1991] as-signs to words with an 'h aspir6'7:","(16) O R"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["X X X"]},{"title":"I I a §","paragraphs":["As is well known, the two types of words behave very differently, for example with regard to the definite article. While words with a lexical representation as in (16) behave like words starting with a 'real', overt, onset, words with a representation like (15) behave markedly different:","(17) a. le tapis- *l' tapis b. la hache - *l' hache c. *la amie - l' amie","It seems that, while the empty onset of (15) is invisible for all phonological processes, the same is not true for the empty onset of (16).","rI disregard the (irrelevant) syllabic status of the final [§] consonant.","So there are two different 'empty onsets' in KLV's theory s. Notice that the type of empty onset for which there is some empirical evidence is exactly the one where the (0 R) - x slot chart does behave like a grid (i.e. where it does not violate the CCC).","So whereas we have here a formal difference between KLV's theory and grid theory, this has no real empirical repercussions.","Another similarity is of course the notion 'government'. For KLV, government only plays a role on the line of x-slots. [Charette, 1991J(p. 27) gives the following summary:","Governing relations must have the following properties:","(i) Constituent government: the head is initial and government is strictly local.","(it) Interconstituent government: the head is final and government is strictly local. Government is subject to the following properties: (i) Only the head of a constituent may govern.","(il) Only the nuclear head may govern a constituent head.","The most important government relation is constituent government: this is the relation that defines the phonological constituent. Moreover, the 'principles' given by Charette are only introduced into the theory to constrain interconstituent government. By definition, constituent government remains unaffected by these. (As for (i), the definition of the notion constituent implies that it is only the head that governs and (it) does not apply because we never find two constituent heads within one constituent).","The two conditions on constituent government (that the head be initial and the governee adjacent to it) can be expressed in our formalisation of the grid in a very simple way: Definition 21 Rx-stot =~'-\"","According to KLV, *-- is the only possible constituent government relation.

Because of the restrictions in (15), KLV notice that this type of government only concerns the following contexts.

The basic ideas underlying each of these frameworks are government/dependency on the one hand and the division of a structure into lines on the other.","The similarity between the frameworks is obscured mainly by the immense differences in notation; but we have shown that the algebraic systems underlying these formalisms is basically the same.","In [Maxwell, 1992] it is shown that the differences between Dependency Graphs and X-bar structures as used in generative syntax are minimal. It remains to be shown whether there are any major formal differences between the bracketed grids that are presented in this paper and the 'X-bar-structures-cure-lines' as they are represented in [Levin, 1985] and [Hermans, 1990].
