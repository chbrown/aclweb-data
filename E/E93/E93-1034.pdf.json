A 'tuple' operation introduced in [Solias, 1992] is defined as a mode of prosodic combination which has associated projection functions, and consequently can support a property of unique prosodic decomposability. Discontinuity operators are defined model-theoretically by a residuation scheme which is particularly arnmenable proof-theoretically. This enables a formulation which both improves on the logic for wrapping and infixing of [Moortgat, 1988] which is only partial, and resolves some problems of determinacy of insertion point in the application of these proposals to in-sits binding phenomena. A discontinuons product is also defined by the residuation scheme, enabling formulation of rules of both use and proof for a 'substring' product that would have been similarly doomed to partial logic. We show how the apparatus enables characterisation of discontinous functors such as particle verbs and phrasal idioms, and binding phenomena such as quantifier rais-ing and pied piping. We conclude by showing how the apparatus enables a simple categorial analysis of (SVO) gapping using the discontinuity product and the wrapping operator.","*The work by Glyn Morrill was for the most part carried out under the support of the Ministerio de Edu. caciJn V Ciencia, Madrid, in the form of visting scholarship grant SB90 P413308C."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In [Lambek, 1958] the suggestive recursive fractional categorial notations of [Ajdukiewicz, 1935] and [Bar-Hillel, 1953] were provided with a foundational set-ting in mathematical logic. This takes the form of a model theory interpreting category formulas in algebraic structures. A Gentzen style sequent proof theory for which there is a Cut-elimination result means that a decision procedure is provided on the basis of sequent calculus.","The category formulas are freely generated from atomic category formulas (e.g. N for referring nominals, S for sentences, CN for common nouns, ...) by binary operators \\ ('under'), / ('over') and • ('product'). The interpretation is in semigroups, i.e. algebras (L, +) where + is a binary operation satisfying the associativity axiom sl + (s~ + s3) = (sl + s2) + s3. (In the non-associative formulation of [Lambek, 1961], this condition is withdrawn.) We may in particular consider the algebra obtained by taking the set V* of strings over a vocabulary V; then L is V* - {t} where t is the empty string. Each category formula A is interpreted as a subset D(A) of L. Given such a mapping for atomic category formulas it is extended to the compound category formulas thus: D(A\\B) = {sirs' ~ D(A),s' + s E D(B)} (1) D(B/A) -- {slVd E D(A),s + s' E D(B)} D(A*B) = {sl + s213Sl e D(A),s2 e D(B)} In general we may define L in terms of a semigroup algebra (L*, +, t) where f E L is an identity element, i.e. an element such that s + t = t + s -- s; then L is L* - {t}. In the sequent calculus of [Lambek, 1958] a sequent is of the form A1,..., An =~ A where n > 0,1 and is read as asserting that for any elements 1The requirement n > 0 blocks the inference from 287 sl,..., Sn in A1,. • •, An respectively, sl + ... + Sn is in A. Thus the relevant prosodic operations are en-coded by the linear ordering of antecedents in the sequent, and structural rules of permutation, contraction, and weakening are not valid. The calculus is as follows. The notation P(A) represents an antecedent containing a subpart A.","a. ~.id r =~ A A(A) =~ B (2) A =~ A Cut"]},{"title":"a(r) B","paragraphs":["b. r =~ A A(B) =~ C A, r ==~ B","\\L ~R aft, A\\B) :=~ C r ::~ A\\B","C. r =~ A A(B) ==~ C r, A =~ B • /L B/A/R A(B/A, r) =~ C r","d.

Cut-free backward chaining proof search is terminating since in every proof step going from conclusion to premises, the total number of operator occurrences is reduced by one.","The original development of categorial grammar grew from semantic concerns, and as is well known, the formalism embraces compositional type-logical semantics. In particular, division categories A\\B and B/A can be seen as Fregean functors: incomplete Bs the meanings of which are abstracted over A argument meanings. Complete (or: saturated) expressions bearing primary meanings belong to atomic categories. Given some basic semantic domains (e.g. truth values {0, 1}, a set of entities E, ...) a hierarchy of spaces for a type-logicai semantics may be generated by such operations as function formation (r[2: the set of all functions from r2 into rl) and pair formation (rl x r~: the set of all ordered pairs comprising a rl followed by a r2). Each category formula A is associated with a semantic do-main T(A). Such a type map T for atomic category formulas (e.g. T(N) = E,T(S) = {0, 1},T(CN) = {0, 1} E) is extended to compound category formulas by T(A\\B) = T(B/A) = T(B) T(A) and T(A*B) = T(A) x T(B). Each category formula A is now interpreted as a set of two dimensional 'signs': a subset D(A) of L x T(A). Such an interpretation for atomic category formulas is extended to one for compound A =~ A to =~ A/A which as a theorem would assert that the identity element t is a member of each category of the form A/A (similarly for A\\A). Since we have defined categories to be interpreted as subsets of a set L which does not necessarily contain an identity element, such a theorem would not be valid, and it is prevented by defining sequents as having at least one antecedent formula. category formulas by: 2 D(A\\B) D(B/A) D(A.B) = {(s,m)IV(s',m') e"]},{"title":"D(A),","paragraphs":["(3) (s' +"]},{"title":"m(m')) e D(B)}","paragraphs":["--"]},{"title":"{(s,m)lV(s',m') e D(A), (, + e, m(m')) e O(B)} = (st, ml) • D(A), (s2, ms) • D(B)}","paragraphs":["Proofs can be annotated to associate typed semantic lambda terms with each theorem [Moortgat, 1988].

Amongst the various enrichments that have been proposed (see e.g. [van Benthem, 1989; Morrill et al., 1990; Barry et al., 1991; Morrill, 1990a; Morrill, 1990b; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991; Morrill, 1992a; Morrill, 1992b]), [Moortgat, 1988] advanced earlier discussion of discontinuity in e.g. [Bach, 1981; Bach, 1984] with a proposal for infixing and wrapping operators. The operators not only provide scope over these particular phenomena but also, as indicated in e.g. [Moortgat, 1990], seem to provide an underlying basis in terms of which operators for binding phenomena such as quantification and reflexivisa-tion should be definable. The coverage of pied piping in [Morrill, 1992b] would also be definable in terms of these primitives, but all this depends on the resolution of certain technical issues which have been to date outstanding.","Amongst the examples we shall be able to treat by means of our present proposals are the following. a. Mary rang John up. (8) b. Mary gave John the cold shoulder. c. John likes everything. d. for whom John works. e. John studies logic, and Charles, phonetics. In the particle-verb construction (8a) and discontinuous idiom (8b), the object 'John' infixes in discontinuous expressions with unitary meanings. In (8c) the quantifier must receive sentential semantic scope, and in (Sd) the pied piping must be generated, with the semantics of 'whom John works for'. In (Be), the semantics of the verb gapped in the second conjunct must be recovered from the first conjunct.","Binary operators T and ~ are proposed in [Moortgat, 1988] such that BTA signifies functors that wrap around their A arguments to form Bs, and BIA signifies functors that infix themselves in their A arguments to form Bs. Assuming the semigroup algebra of associative Lambek calculus, there are two possibilities in each case, depending on whether we are free to insert anywhere (universal), or whether the relevant insertion points are fixed (existential). We leave semantics aside for the moment.

(Evidently Tv would permit incorrect word order such as *'Mary gave the John cold shoulder'.) The problem with ordered sequents is that the implicit encoding of prosodic operations is of limited expressivity. Accordingly, [Moortgat, 1991b] seeks to improve the situation by means of explicit prosodic labelling. This does enable both rules for e.g. ~v but still does not enable the useful TjL: the remaining problem is, as noted by [Versmissen, 1991], that we need to have an insertion point somehow de-terminate from the prosodic label for an existential wrapper in order to perform a left inference.","In [Moortgat, 1991a] a discontinuity product is proposed, again implicitly assuming just a semigroup algebra: 5","D(A ® B) = {sl + s2 +dl ]Sl + st e D(A), (12) s2 E D(B)} As for the discontinuity divisions, ordered sequent presentation cannot express rules of both use and proof: only ®R can be represented:","rl, F2 ::~ A A =~ B (13) '®R F1,A,F2 =~ A®B Even using labelling, the problem for ®L remains and is the same as that above: there is no proper management of separation points.","In [Moortgat, 1991a] it is observed how the quantifying-in of infix binders such as quantifier","SThe version given is actually just the existential case of two possibilities, existential and universal, as before.

Thus the algebra satisfies the conditions: l(sl, s2) = sx 2(sl, 82) = 82 (14) (Is, 2s) -\" s We may in particular think of the algebra of elements V* obtained from disjoint sets V and {[, ;, ]} by clos-ing V under two binary operations: concatenation +, and pairing [.; .] where pairing can be defined as concatenation with delimitation and marking of insertion point.","The proposal can be related to [Moortgat and Morrill, 1991] which also considers algebras with more than one adjunction operation (each either associative or non-associative), and defines divisions and products with respect to each by residuation. Note however that firstly, our tuple prosodic operation is not simply that of non-associative Lambek calculus which is characterised by the absence of any axiom (associative or otherwise), since the projection axioms entail specific conditions not imposed in the non-associative case: we might describe the tuple system as unassociative. Tupling is bijective and a prosodic object s formed by tupling records a separation point between two objects ls and 2s whereas a prosodic object formed by non-associative adjunction has no such recoverable separation point. Secondly, we are not primarily interested here in divisions and products based on tupling but in the combined use of the associative and unassociative operations to define discontinuity operators. (Note however that residuation with respect to tupling, as proposed in [Solias, 1992], would define operators suitable for verbs regarded as head-wrappers such as 'persuade'.) This brings us to the essence of the present proposals with respect to wrapping and infixing. The prosodic interpretation for the discontinuity operators is to be as follows: D(BTA) ={s[Vs' e D(A), ls + s' + 2s e D(B)} (15) D(BIA) = {siVa' e D(A), ls' + s + 28' G D(B)} D(A ® B) = {181 + 82 + 282[81 • D(A),82 • D(B)} It can be seen that the operators are the residuation divisions with respect to a binary prosodic operation I defined by szIs2 = 181 + s2 + 281 just as the Lambek operators are the residuation divisions with respect to +. Use of the tuple operation collapses the former distinction between existential and universal in (9) and (10). Because pairing is bijective and tuples express a unique insertion point, there is a unique decomposition of tupled elements. Existential and universal wrappers collapse into a single wrapper and existential and universal infixers collapse into a single infixer.","Turning to include the semantics, the type map is as is to be expected for functors and for product: T(BTA) = T(BIA) = T(B) T(A) and T(A @ B) = T(A) x T(B), and as usual a category formula A is interpreted as a subset of L x T(A).","D(BTA) = {(s,m)[V(s',m') • D(A), (16)","(ls + 8' + 2s, m(m')) • D(S)}","D(B~A) = {(s, rn)]V(s',rn') • D(A),","(Is' + s + 28', m(m')) • D(B)}","D(A®B) = {(lSl+S2+2sl,(ml,m2))[","(sl, rnl) • D(A), (s2, m2) • D(B)} The full prosodically and semantically labelled logic is given in Figure 1.

The meaning of the particle verb and the phrasal idiom resides with its elements together, which wrap around their object.

Consequently, there is no need to check for the data type of prosodic objects such as by patternmatching on antecedent terms (see comment above on transparency of rules). It may be possible to develop the present proposals by adding sort structure to the prosodic algebra in a manner analogous to the typing of the semantic algebra. Such sorting could be essential to defining a model theory with respect to which the calculus can be shown to be complete. Recursive nesting of infixation points does not appear to be motivated linguistically, and the present calculus does not support it. A sorted model theory which excludes the recursion might provide an interpretation with respect to which the present calculus is both sound and complete. 6.2 Quantifier Raising In Montague grammar quantifying-in is motivated by the necessity to achieve sentential scope for all quantifiers and quantifier-scope ambiguities. Quantifying-in allows a quantifier phrase to apply as a semantic functor to its sentential context. Quantifying-in at different sentence levels enables a quantifier to take scope accordingly, and alternative orderings of quantifying-in enable quantifiers to take different scopings relative to one another. In [Moortgat, 1990] a binary operator ~ is defined for which the rule of use is essentially quantifying-in, so that a Montagovian treatment of quantifier-scoping is achieved by assignment of a quantifier phrase like 'something' to N~S, and assignment of determiners like 'every' to (N~S)/CN. In [Moortgat, 1991a] he suggests that a category such as A ~ B might be definable as B~(BTA), but notes that this definability does not hold for his definitions, for which, furthermore, the logic is problematic. On the present formulation however, these intuitions are realised. The category S~(STN) is a suitable category for a quantifier phrase such as 'everything' or 'some man', achiev-ing sentential quantifier scope, and quantificational ambiguity.","Assume the lexical entry (22). everything - XzVy(x y) := SI(SI\"N) (22) For 'John likes everything' there is the derivation in Figure 3. In this derivation, and in general, lines are included showing explicit label manipulations under equality in the prosodic algebra, in such a way that all rule instances match the rule presentations. Substitution of the lexical prosodies and semantics as-sociates John + likes + everything with (23) which simplifies as shown. (AzVy(x y) Ac((like c) john)) --* (23) Vy((like y) john) In this example the' quantifier is peripheral in the sentence and a category (S/N)\\S could have been used in associative Lambek calculus. However, another category S/(N\\S) would be needed to allow the quantifier phrase to appear in subject position, and further assignments still would be required for post-verbal position in a ditransitive verb phrase, and so on. Some generality can be achieved by assuming second-order polymorphie categories (see [Emms, 1990]), but note that the single assignment we have given allows appearance in all N positions without further ado, and allows all the relative quantifier scopings at S nodes. 6.3 Pied Piping In [Moortgat, 1991a] and and [Morrill, 19925] a three-place operator is considered which is like A B, except that quantifying-in changes the category of the context expression..

But an example where the relative pronoun is not peripheral in the pied piped material, such as 'a man a brother of whom from Brazil appeared on television' would be problematic for the same reasons as quantification. The solution, in terms of infixing and wrapping, is the same in the two cases, but pied piping has been a more conspicuous problem for categorial grammar because while the scoping of quantifiers can be played down, the syntactic realisation of pied piping is only too evident. In the phrase structure tradition, pied piping has been taken as strong motivation for feature percolation (see [Pollard, 1988]). We have seen here how discontinuity operators challenge this construal.","Categorial grammar is well-known to provide OSSibilities for 'non-constituent' coordination (see","teedman, 1985; Dowty, 1988J) less accessible in the phrase structure/feature percolation approach.

This involves special treatment of both the right and the left conjunct. We present our discussion in the context of the present minimal example of gapping a transitive verb TV.","With respect to the right hand conjunct, the initial problem is to give a categorisation at all.

The blocking is necessary because 'and Charles, phonetics' is clearly not of category TV\\S: 'Studies and Charles, phonetics' is not a sentence. Now, with respect to the left hand conjunct, Steedman invokes a special decomposition of 'John studies logic' analysed as S, into TV and TV\\S. There is then constituent coordination between TV\\S and TV\\S. Finally the coordinate structure of category TV\\S combines with TV on the left to give S.","Although this treatment addresses the two problems that any account of gapping must solve, categorisation of the right hand conjunct and access of the verbal semantics in the left hand conjunct, it at-tempts to do so within a narrow conception of categorial grammar (only division operators) that necessiates invocation of distinctly contrived mechanisms. We believe that the radical reconstruals of grammar implicated by this analysis are not necessary given the general framework including discontinuity operators we have set out. We address for the moment just our minimal example.","Within the context of categorial grammar we have established, the right hand conjunct is characterisable as STTV. It remains to access the understood verbal semantics from the sentence that is the left hand conjunct. In order to recover from the left hand side the information we miss on the right hand side, we would like to say that this information, the category and semantics of the verb, is made available to the coordinator when it combines with the left conjunct. In accordance with the spirit of Steedman, we can observe that the left hand conjunct contains a part with the category SI\"TV of the right hand constituent, but it is discontinuous, be-ing interpolated by TV. But this is precisely what is expressed by the discontinuous product category (STTV)®TV. Furthermore, an element of such a category has as its semantics a pair the second projection of which is the semantics of the TV. Consequently gapping is generated by assignment of 'and' to the category (((STTV)®TV)\\S)/(STTV) with semantics"]},{"title":"~x~y[(rly","paragraphs":["lr2y) A (x 7r2y)].","The complete derivation for (27) is as in Figure 5, where TV abbreviates (N\\S)/N.

In [Moortgat, 1991b] the LDS formalism was invoked, but as we have seen, the LDS format alone is not enough. The present paper has argued that a different view is required on the model theory of discontinuity than that suggested by interpretation in just a semigroup algebra. This view is provided by adding to the algebra of interpretation the tuple operation of [Solias, 1992]. Not only does this clear up some vagueness with respect to existential and universal formulations, it also admits of a full labelled logic. This has brought us to a stage where it is appropriate to address such issues as completeness and Cut-elimination."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank the following for comment on an earlier abstract: Juan Barba, Alain Lecomte, Michael Moortgut, Koen Versmissen, and three anonymous EACL reviewers.
