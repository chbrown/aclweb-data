This approach works well when the structural discrepancies between form and meaning representations are finitely bounded, but there are some phenomena in natural language, e.g. adverbs in English, where this restriction does not hold. In this paper, we describe rule-based type-driven interpretation algorithms which cover cases of such a structural misalignment by exploiting a new descriptive device, the \"restriction operator\". The algorithms are set up in such a way that recursive rules can be derived for the interpretation of adjunct sets within a codescripiion approach (see [Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993] for details). 1"]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["In [Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982] Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) was introduced as a grammatical formalism that assigns to a sentence entities of two different levels of representation: a c-structure representing information on the structure of the phrases of a sentence and an f-structure which represents its underlying predicate-argument structure. The structures are set in correspondence by a function from the c-structure nodes (constituents) into the sub-structures of the f-structure. The f-structure is identified with the smallest structure that satisfies the f-description, a description of the f-structure which is built up by instantiation of the annotations of the context-free rules and projected off the c-structure by the correspondence mapping.","This architecture was then extended by Kaplan [1987] and Halvorsen [1987] to structures representing information on other levels of linguistic representation. These structures (called projections) are codescribed by the annotations of the context-free grammar and set in correspondence by additional projectors. Furthermore, Kaplan et ai. [1989] applied the general correspondence architecture to the problem of translation by projecting from the f-structure of a sentence of a given source language an additional f-structure of its translation into some target language.","Within the domain of semantic interpretation, which is the topic here, the semantic structures are the range of the a-projector which maps substruc-tures of the f-structure into corresponding substruc-tures of the semantic structure.

On the other hand, it becomes clear by examples with more than one adjunct that in addition a new source for recursion is needed, since it must in principle be possible to construct a multiple nesting for adjunct sets whose size is not bounded by any fixed finite upper bound. 2","In order to identify this additional recursive device and to test our extended description language for adequacy, we picked out Montague semantics as a well-known semantic theory and tried to specify the syntax-semantics interface by a rule-based semantic interpretation mechanism. Our goal is to derive the semantic representation by analyzing the f-structure recursively. We assume an interpretation mechanism that operates on f-structures (possibly extended by information on the linear precedence of the predicates) and can be stated by very general compositionality principles without relying on any kind of transformations. This is because an f-structure of a sentence represents its deep structure in terms of predicate-argument relations where all information relevant for the interpretation is locally available. Furthermore, we want to ensure the \"completeness\" of the interpretation and to specify conditions which allow us to control the \"conservativity\" of the extension (for those who require that a theory of grammar such as LFG be strong enough to ensure the (semantic) well-formedness of the strings accepted by a particular grammar). On the other hand, we want the semantic structure to be accessible from the f-structure by an explicit interpretation function (a-projector) in order to be able to formulate constraints, e.g. binding and scoping principles, which constrain the interpretation of the f-structures.","In this paper, we give three different type-driven interpretation mechanisms which fulfill the requirements given above. The first one is a rather simple top-down algorithm that can be described by our extended description language but cannot be used for all type systems. The second algorithm is a more powerful bottom-up algorithm which can be used for all type systems but not formulated in our description language. The third one, finally, is a top-down simulation of the second algorithm which is again describable in our description language. The fact that the third algorithm can be described by our extended description language seems to confirm the adequacy of our extension by the restriction operator. Further-more, this investigation indicates that an additional description-by-analysis mechanism is needed within a codescription approach in order to handle cases","2This situation, where the recursion given by the context-free rule system turns out not to be the adequate or at least desirable carrier for specific (recursive) description purposes, is not unusual. Functional uncertainty was e.g. introduced as a new recursive device operating on f-structures, since unbounded dependencies could be more adequately handled by this new mechanism than by exploiting the recursive phrase structure rule system alone. 405 where the interpretation recursion is completely independent of the recursion given by the context-free grammar (cf.

For an interpreted structure g containing an immediate substructure or a set element h, principle (A2) drops the interpretation downwards if g and h are of the same type.

The algorithm fails in cases where the type of the substructure representing the main functor indicates that more than one argument is needed by the main functor in order to yield a meaning of the type of the entire f-structure. If we choose e.g. the '3times' modifier in the structure of figure 7 as the main functor (having widest scope), then we need a first argument of type (e,t) and a second argument of type e to get a meaning of type t. So, the rest of the structure corresponds in the general case to a list or set of arguments.","In order to overcome this difficulty, we assign to 408 the rest structure now a separate semantic structure. This structure is a set that contains typed variables for all those arguments which are still needed to saturate previously processed (complex) functors.

As is well-known, the attractiveness of this principle gets lost to some degree if we have to handle phenomena which can only be described by assuming transformations on the constituent structures.","In LFG, the f-structures describe explicitly the underlying predicate-argument structures of well-formed expressions, and the components of an expression are taken to be the sets of string elements that are mapped via ¢ (the structural correspondence between c- and f-structure) to the units of its type-driven decomposed f-structure. On this view, the meaning of an expression remains a function of the meaning of its components. Thus, the reading of sentence (5) given in figure 6, e.g., is composed of the meanings of the components {(1, John), (2, arrived), (4, today)} and {(3,1ate)} as-sociated with f \\ (ADJ a) and a by ¢, respectively.
