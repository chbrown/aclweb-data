The parser computes the intersection of the sentence automaton and all rule automata; the intersection is the parse of the sentence.","The grammar also contains a heuristic section that can be used to rank multiple analyses."]},{"title":"3 Sample analysis","paragraphs":["The sentence Its leadership was insulted"]},{"title":"by","paragraphs":["editors gets two analyses, when no heuristics are applied:","@@ it <lionMod> PROM GEM SG3 @>I @ leadership li liOM S@ be V PAST SGI.OR.3 VFIli insult <SVO> PCP2 by PREP editor li liON PL","FULLSTOP @SUBJ @ @AUX @ @HV MAINC@ @ @ADVL @ @P< @","@@ @@ @ @ it <lionNod> PRON {]Eli SG3 @>li leadership li liOM SG @SUBJ be <SV> <SVC/N> <SVC/A>","V PAST SGI.0R.3 VFIli @MV NAIl[C@ @ insult PCP2 @SC @ by PREP @ADVL/N< @ editor I liOM PL @P< @","FULLSTOP @@","Syntactic tags @>li determiner or premodifier @SUBJ subject of a finite clause @AUX auxiliary in a finite clause @MV main verb in a finite clause MAIliC@ finite main clause @AD'~ adverbial @P< preposition complement @SC subject complement %ADVL/N< adverbial or a postmodifier","of a nominal"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Voutilainen and Tapanalnen, 1993] Atro Voutilaihen and Pasi Tapanainen.
