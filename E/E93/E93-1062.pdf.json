This can only be attained currently by keeping the human in the translation loop, in our case via a software module called the AUO~R. The main measure of progress in the development of the Pangloss system will therefore be the gradual decrease in need for user assistance, as the level of automation increases.","The analyzer used in the first version of PANGLOSS, PANGLOSS MARK I, is a version of the ULTRA Spanish analyzer from NMSU [Farwell 1990], while generation is carried out by the PENMAN generator from ISI [Mann 1983]. The Translator's Workstation (TWS) provides the user interface and the integration platform [Nirenburg 1992]. This paper focuses on this use of TWS as a substrate for PANGLOSS.","PANOLOSS operates in the following mode: a) a fully-automated translation of each full sentence is attempted; if it fails, then b) a fully-automated translation of smaller chunks of text is attempted (in the first PANGLOSS configuration, PANGLOSS MARK I, these were noun phrases); c) the material that does not get covered by noun phrases is treated in \"word-for-word\" mode, whereby translation suggestions for each word (or phrase) are sought in the system's MT lexicons, a machine-readable dictionary, and a set of user glossaries; d) The resulting list of translated noun phrases and translation suggestions for words and phrases is displayed in a special editor window of TWS, where the human user finalizes the translation. At stages a) and b) there is an option of the user being presented by the system with disambiguation questions via the AUGMENTOR. We provide an intelligent environment, the CMAT (Constituent Machine-Aided Translation) editor, for postediting. It allows the user to select, move, and delete words and phrases"]},{"title":"(constituents)","paragraphs":["quickly and easily, using dynamically-changing menus.","As can be seen in Figure 1, each constituent in the target window is surrounded by \"<<\" and \">>\" characters. If the user clicks with the mouse anywhere within a constituent (between the \"<<\" and \">>\" symbols), a CMAT menu for that constituent appears. It contains the word or phrase in the source text if available, the functions Move and Delete, and alternative translations of the word or phrase from the source text if any. Using these popup menus, the user moves, replaces, or deletes a constituent with a single mouse action, rapidly turning the list of translated words","1PANOLOSS is a joint project of the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the Cornpuling Research Laboratory of New Mexico State University (NMSU), and the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (IS1).

Many minor improvements of the tool itself are planned that should together result in a significant increase in the human translator's comfort and efficiency."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Farwell, D., Y.
