The initial grammar for the inference process makes no ,assumption of the kinds of structures and their distributions. The inferred grammar is evaluated by its predicting power and by comparing the bracketing of held out sentences imposed by the inferred grammar with the partial bracketings of these sentences given in the corpus. Using part-of-speech tags as the only source of lexical information, high bracketing accuracy is achieved even with a small subset of the available training material (1045 sentences): 94.4% for test sentences shorter than 10 words and 90.2% for sentences shorter than 15 words."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Most broad coverage natural language parsers have been designed by incorporating hand-crafted rules. These rules are also very often further refined by statistical training. Furthermore, it is widely believed that high performance can only be achieved by disambiguating lexically sensitive phenomena such as prepositional attachment ambiguity, coordination or subcategorizadon.","So far, grammar inference has not been shown to be effective for designing wide coverage parsers.","Baker (1979) describes a training algorithm for stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG) which can be used for grammar reestimation (Fujisaki et al. 1989, Sharrnan et al. 1990, Black et al. 1992, Briscoe and Waegner 1992) or grammar inference from scratch (Lari and Young 1990). However, the application of SCFGs and the original inside-outside algorithm for grammar inference has been inconclusive for two reasons. First, each iteration of the algorithm on a gr,-unmar with n nonterminals requires"]},{"title":"O(n31wl 3)","paragraphs":["time per t~ning sentence w. Second, the inferred grammar imposes bracketings which do not agree with linguistic judgments of sentence structure.","Pereira and Schabes (1992) extended the inside-out-side algorithm for inferring the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar to take advantage of constituent bracketing information in the training text. Although they report encouraging experiments (90% bracketing accuracy) on h'mguage transcriptions in the Texas Instrument subset of the Air Travel Information System (ATIS), the small size of the corpus (770 bracketed sentences containing a total of 7812 words), its linguistic simplicity, and the computation time required to vain the grammar were reasons to believe that these results may not scale up to a larger and more diverse corpus.","We report grammar inference experiments with this algorithm from the parsed Wall Street Journal corpus. 341 The experiments prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the inside-outside algorithm on a htrge corpus.","Such experiments are made possible by assumi'ng a right br~mching structure whenever the parsed corpus leaves portions of the parsed tree unspecified. This preprocessing of the corpus makes it fully bracketed. By taking adv~mtage of this fact in the implementation of the inside-outside ~dgorithm, its complexity becomes line~tr with respect to the input length (as noted by Pereira and Schabes, 1992) ,and therefore tractable for large corpora.","We report experiments using several kinds of initial gr~unmars ~md a variety of subsets of the corpus as training data. When the entire Wall Street Journal corpus was used as training material, the time required for training has been further reduced by using a par~dlel implementation of the inside-outside ~dgorithm.","The inferred grammar is evaluated by measuring the percentage of compatible brackets of the bracketing imposed by the inferred grammar with the partial bracketing of held out sentences. Surprisingly high bracketing accuracy is achieved with only 1042 sentences as train- • ing materi,'d: 94.4% for test sentences shorter th,-m 10 words ~md 90.2% for sentences shorter than 15 words. Furthermore, the bracketing accuracy does not drop drastic~dly as longer sentences ,are considered. These results ,are surprising since the training uses part-of-speech tags as the only source of lexical information. This raises questions about the statistical distribution of sentence structures observed in naturally occurring text.","After having described the training material used, we report experiments using several subsets of the available training material ,and evaluate the effect of the training size on the bracketing perform,'mce. Then, we describe a method for reducing the number of parameters in the inferred gr~unmars. Finally, we suggest a stochastic model for inferring labels on the produced binary br~mching trees."]},{"title":"2 Training Corpus","paragraphs":["The experiments use texts from the Wall Street Journ~d Corpus ,and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank (Brill et al., 1990).

We experimented with several subsets (350, 1095, 8000 ,and 34500 sentences) of the available training materi~d.","For practiced purposes, the part of the tree bank used for training is preprocessed before being used. First, fiat portions of parse trees found in the tree b,'mk are turned into a right linear binary br~mching structure. This enables us to take full adv~mtage of the fact that the extended inside-outside ~dgorithm (as described in Pereira and Schabes, 1992) behaves in linear time when the text is fully bracketed. Then, the syntactic labels are ignored. This allows the reestimation algorithm to distribute its own set of labels based on their actual distribution.

This constraint is important for smoothing. It implies that no rule ever disappears at a reestimation step.","However, once the final grammar is found, for practi-cal purposes, one can reduce the number of parameters being used. For example, the size of the grammar can be reduced by eliminating the rules whose probabilities are below some threshold or by keeping for each non-terminal only the top rules rewriting it.","However, one runs into the risk of not being able to parse sentences given as input. We used the following smoothing heuristics.","Lexieal rule smoothing. In the case no rule in the gnunmar introduces a terminal symbol found in the input string, we assigned a lexical rule (X i ~ tin) with very low • probability for all non-terminal symbols. This case will not happen if the training is representative of the lexical items.","Syntactic rule smoothing. When the sentence is not recognized from the starting symbol, we considered ,all possible non-terminal symbols as starting symbols ,and considered as starting symbol the one that yields the most likely ,'malysis. Although this procedure may not guarantee that ,all sentences will be recognized, we found it is very useful in practice.","When none of the above procedures enable parsing of the sentence, we used the entire set of parameters of the inferred gr,~mar (this was never the case on the test sentences we considered).","For example, the grammar whose performance is depicted in Table 2 defines 4095 parameters.

Implementation","paragraphs":["Pereira and Schabes (1992) note that the training ,algorithm behaves in linear time (with respect to the sentence length) when the training material consists of fully bracketed sentences. By taking advantage of this fact, the experiments using a small number of initial rules and a small subset of the available training materials do not require a lot of computation time and can be performed on a single workstation. However, the experiments using larger initial grammars or using more material require more computation.","The training algorithm can be parallelized by dividing the training corpus into fixed size blocks of sentences ,and by having multiple workstations processing each one of them independently. When ,all blocks have been computed, the counts are merged and the parameters are reestimated.

Stochastic Model of Labeling for Binary Branching Trees","paragraphs":["The stochastic grmnmars inferred by the training procedures produce unlabeled parse trees. We are currently evaluating the following stochastic model for labeling a binary branching tree. In this approach, we make the simplifying assumption that the label of a node only depends on the labels of its children.
