Sentences containing temporal connectives are presuppositional: the temporal clause introduces an eventuality that must be presupposed to have occurred, for the sentence as a whole to have a truth-value (cf. Hein~imgki 1972; Kartunnen 1973). If the presupposed eventuality is not already in the reader's model of the discourse context, she must add it: a process known as accommodation (cf. Lewis 1979). Our view is that the discourse behaviour of temporal connectives is to be explained as follows. In the discourse context where we are describing El, and have uttered (1), the way presuppositions are accommodated depends on the reader's background knowledge; our inappropriate discourses are precisely those where accommodation ultimately leads to discourse incoherence. In particular, the presupposed eventuality from they were pacified cannot be accommodated in the previous context provided by (1), and must therefore be given further treatment.","A presuppositional explanation stands in contrast to the classical accounts of temporal structure built upon Kamp's (1981) Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (cf. Partee 1984; Hinrichs 1986). On both these accounts, subordinate clauses, such as those introduced by temporal connectives, update the current reference time, and the main clause is then interpreted with respect to that reference time. However, no constraint is placed on the relationship between the current reference time, and the new reference time supplied by the subordinate clause. And so no anomaly will be detected in (2b): a relation of temporal progression between (1)'s reference time and the new reference time for they were pacified will be added to the DRS. Thus, the incoherence of (2b) in the discourse context supplied by (1) remains unexplained. This is only to be expected, since the construction of discourse representation structures is syntax-driven, and does not attempt to capture the interactions with world knowledge which seem relevant here.","So, although it promises to go further, the basic presuppositional explanation raises deeper ques-tions. Why can't they were pacified be accommodated into the discourse context provided by (1)? What knowledge is it that leads to failure in this case, but success when we try to accommodate Major launched a charm offensive? Intuitively, the reader's background knowledge affects accommodation: world knowledge (WK) and pragmatic maxims can make accommodation impossible. 1 So to make 1 Background knowledge is also essential to the expla-the basic explanation precise, we need a formal theory of how such knowledge constrains accommodation.","Van der Sandt and Geurts (1991) provide a formal mechanism for presupposition accommodation in DRT, but they provide only informal heuristics that stipulate how background knowledge might affect the process. We extend their ideas, by providing a formal specification of those heuristics. We embed their account of accommodation in DICE (Discourse and C_ommousense Entailment) (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993; Lascarides et al 1992). DICE permits us to model the interactions between linguistic knowledge (LK) and WK which lead to the assignment of discourse coherence relations between propositions introduced by text segments, and temporal-causal relations between the eventualities they denote. The primary proposal is that the accommodation of presuppositions from temporal subordinate clauses be modelled as discourse attachment, so that accommodation is properly constrained by the reader's background knowledge. Let us call this basic idea accommodation by discourse attachment (ADA).","Although we contrasted presuppositional accounts with classical DRT approaches, there are clear instances where a temporal subordinate clause has no special rhetorical role in a discourse, but acts instead as a temporal adverb. Such instances are less problematic for classical approaches than cases like (1,2b), but at the same time would pose problems for an account of temporal connectives that relied exclusively on ADA. Consider texts (3,4a) and (3,4b), modified from Hamann (1989:83-84): (3) I'm not a useless driver.","(4) a. I could drive before you were born. b. ?You were born after I could drive. (3,4a) and (3,4b) are temporally equivalent, but only the former is discourse coherent. If ADA were the whole story, then (3,4a) would be analysed as incoherent, since no rhetorical connection can be located between the speaker's driving ability and the hearer's birth. But (3,4a) is coherent, because the reference to birth is simply functioning as an adverbial, locat-ing the starting point of driving in the distant past.","We will therefore suggest that the primary proposal, where accommodation involves discourse attachment, must leave room for the possibility that presupposed eventualities can be directly added to a discourse context, without any discourse relations being involved. Let us call this latter idea accommodation by temporal addition (ATA). Our treatment of temporal connectives combines ADA and ATA; it thus effectively deals with temporal subordinate clauses by bringing together the presuppositional account nation of the presuppositions of the counterfactual uses of before, first observed by Heingtm~ki (1972:139). We have no space to discuss these here, unfortunately. 261 and the classical DRT account. We now briefly review the two basic ingredients of the account: A mechanism for presupposition accommodation, and a theory of discourse attachment. 4 A mechanism for presupposition"]},{"title":"accommodation","paragraphs":["Van der Sandt and Geurts (1991) assume that presuppositions are anaphora with semantic content.

First, binding may be successful, but the resultant constituents of the discourse may fail to attach together (as in (3,4b)). Secondly, binding may fail, while ADA is successful, and then the resultant constituents of the discourse may fail to attach together (as in (1,2b)). Thirdly, binding and ADA may fail, while ATA is successful--as in (3,4a)--but then, in contrast to (3,4a), the resultant constituents may fail to attach together.

But the Revolt Law entails the opposite. So a Nixon Diamond crystallises and the discourse is incoherent.","~,From examining (1,2b) and (1,2d), it should be apparent that managing to accommodate a presupposition by discourse attaching it to its matrix is not in itself sufficient for discourse coherence. The SDRS formed must still be attached within the preceding discourse context. It is this second attachment that fails to occur in these cases. Both Conceptual Immediacy and No Cause can yield discourse incoherence. In (2d), for example, if it weren't for No Cause, the Charm Law would have won during accommodation instead of States Overlap. This would have changed the set of laws which apply when attaching e to a, leading to different inferences about the discourse. 8.3 Temporal addition with coherence Now consider text (3,4a): (3) I'm not a useless driver.

This indicates that success in the early stages of processing doesn't guarantee coherence; nor does failure in the first attempt to accommodate guarantee incoherence. 8.4 Binding with incoherence We finally provide an example where the presupposition is bound, and the resultant discourse is incoherent: (3) I'm not a useless driver.

The way in which accommodation is handled depends on the content of the presupposed clause, and we pointed to some interesting behaviour in this connection.","On the one hand, when accommodation by discourse attachment fails, accommodation by temporal addition can still succeed. In such cases, a purely temporal reading of the subordinate clause is forced, and this leads to very weak coherence constraints for the discourse as a whole. These weak constraints are akin to those in classical treatments of temporal connectives in DRT; however, our analysis still differs somewhat, eschewing as it does reference times. On the other hand, even when accommodation by discourse attachment succeeds, there is no guarantee that the text is coherent; presupposition accommodation is a necessary, but insufficient, part of the process of discourse structure retreival."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Asher, 1993] Nicholas Asher."]},{"title":"Reference to Abstract Objects in English: A Philosophical Semantics for Natural Language Metaphysics.","paragraphs":["Kluwer Academic Publishers.","[Asher and Morreau, 1991] Nicholas Asher and Michael Morreau.
