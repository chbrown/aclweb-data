The scope of marker Ys is defined by the PDILS, instead of the main DRS, which allows that Nancy and Betty do not necessarily like the same cat. But this same feature introduces a problem for pronoun resolution. This problem occurs when pronouns refer to indefinite NPs which are in the universe of a PDRS and therefore inaccessible.

The desirable antecedent y2 in P1 is blockedJ A solution to the problem of the indefinite descriptions appearing in PDRSs, is to make them accessible in the main DRS. This paper shows, by slightly modifying Klein's PDRSs, how that can be done, without losing their desirable characteristics. Firstly, we outline informally how indefinite descriptions in PDRSs are made accessible. Then we show how this idea relates to aspects like negation, disjunction, quantification and the strict/sloppy identity of VP Ellipsis. Finally, we report about the implementation under development.","1Notice, that proper names and definite descriptions do not give rise to this problem.

So, the difference here to Klein's approach is that, besides the referent for the individual which is applied to the PDRS, all indefinite descriptions in the universe of the PDRS are associated with corresponding arguments as well. 2 A lambda expression for P1 in (6) is: (7) A Yl A Y2 (cat(y2) A like(yl,y2)) (xl) (x2) This treatment allows that we can refer to the indefinite cat, as is done in P2 of (6). An added advantage is that we maintain the original properties ofa PDtLS outlined previously. Note, that the number of arguments applied to a PDRS directly depends on the number of indefinite descriptions in the VP. Consequently, a VP with a ditransitive verb could yield two indefinite descriptions, as in (8). Optional relative clauses can raise this number even higher (9).

To represent the sloppy reading, the anaphoric material in (23) that holds the presupposition must not be resolved at the stage of DRS-merging, but left there to provide accommodation another time (with other constraints, that depend on the antecedent of the possessor). In this way both the strict and sloppy reading are obtainable in case of VP Ellipsis. We show this proposal with our example (22), corresponding with DRS (25). Similar to (24), the presupposition causes an antecedent to be created (i.e. Nancy possesses a cat), with this difference, that the anaphoric material is not resolved. The VP-anaphor finds as an antecedent PI: strokes her cat. The presuppositional material in the dashed DRS can now be accommodated to two different antecedents: Firstly, Nancy, where no antecedent has to be created for the possessive construction, resulting in the strict reading.

The emphasis of the implementation lies on anaphora resolution (like do-anaphora and pronouns) in a domain of a small fragment of English. A parse of a typical discourse is: > Mary likes a cat. > She does not beat it. > John does not either.","drs : [ xl x3 x6 p2 p5 ]","[ x l = mary p2(xl,x3):[ y x4 ]","[ cat (x4)","like(y,x4) ]","not £ 3 £ pS(xl):£ y ]","[ beat(y,x3) ] ] x6 = john not [ ]","£ pS(x~) ] ] This implementation differs from other PROLOG-implementations of DRT (e.g. the threading account of [Johnson and Klein, 1986]) in the way it constructs DRSs. Following lasher, 1990], DRSs are constructed in a bottom-up fashion, using A-conversion. Each lexical entry is associated with a SubDRS, representing the meaning of that entry. For instance, the lexical entries for a, man, and runs are:","lex(ap","det : [agr=sing,","def=ind,","drsffi (X'P) \"(X'Q) \"drs( [2, [P ,Q] )3 ).","lex (mSll m","noun: [agr=sing, ~s=X'~s ( [X], [man(X) 3 ), gender--male, refffiX] ).","lex (runs,","iv: [agrfsing,","drsfX'drs ( D, [do(P ,X) :drs ( [y], [run(y)] )] ),","reffP] ). As these entries make clear, a DtLS is constructed of a PROLOG term containing two lists, where the first one contains the discourse markers (i.e. the domain) and the second one the constraints (these are represented as PROLOG terms). Furthermore, the lambda abstractor is constructed as the PROLOG operator ''̂ (this idea is taken from [Pereira and Shieber, 1987]). While parsing a sentence, the DtLS for that sentence is processed by A-conversion and merging, using syntax rules of the following form 5 (as in [Alshawl, 1992]):","np:[drs=Drs,agr=Agr .... ] ---> [det:[drs=A2\"Drs .... ], noun:[drs=Al,agr=Agr .... ], optrel:[drs=Al'A2,...]]. The output of a sentence parse is a constructed DRS for that sentence, but with referring expressions (if any) still unresolved. This sentence-DRS then is merged with the ingoing DRS, representing the computed discourse so far. During this merge, the following computing actions take place: • Computing of arguments for PDRSs; • Resolving of Pronouns and'VP Ellipsis;","• Accommodation of Proper Names, Definite Descriptions, and Possessive Constructions. An aid to these computations is a historylist computed during the sentence parse. This historylist contains all the items that are represented in the discourse, extended with information that is not purely semantic, such as type and gender of certain subjects, but necessary for the computations mentioned above. This results in a new DRS, capturing the entire discourse, which will be the ingoing DtLS for the merge after the next sentence is parsed. 7 Conclusion By slightly changing Klein's treatment of Predicate-DRSs, that is making indefinite descriptions occurring in the scope of the VP accessible to the top level of the main DRS, we obtain a much better mechanism for handling VP Ellipsis in DRT without losing any old characteristics in the theory. Furthermore, we proposed to use Van der Sandt's theory on presuppositions in a different way in our framework to","SFor reasons of clarity, some information in these rules is omitted. 429 derive both strict and sloppy readings where possible. This presentation is informal.
