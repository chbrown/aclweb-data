We are happy that despite strong competition from other Computational Linguistics events and economic turmoil in many European countries, this EACL is comparable to the successful previous ones, both in terms of the number of papers submitted and in terms of attendance. We have a strong scientific program, including ten workshops, four tutorials, a demos session and a student research workshop. I am convinced that you will appreciate our program. What does a General Chair at EACL have to do? Not much, it turns out. My job was to act as a liaison between the local organizing team, the scientific committees, and the EACL board, and to give advice when needed. Looking back at the thousands of e-mails I was copied on reminded me of the Jerome K. Jerome quote: ”I like work. I can sit and look at it for hours”. It has been an enjoyable experience to cooperate with the many people who made this conference happen, and to see them work. I have learned a lot from them. The Program Committee at an ACL conference is a trained army of Area Chairs, Program Committee members, and additional reviewers. Mirella Lapata and Lluı́s Màrquez commanded this particular one. It is thanks to the voluntary peer reviewing work, year after year, of this large group of people, formed by the top researchers in our field, that you will find a high-quality program. It is thanks to Mirella and Llu ı́s that you will not only find the quality we expect from EACL, but also innovation, coherence, breadth, and depth. I can’t thank them enough for their work on all aspects of the scientific program and for their advice on virtually any other aspect of the organization. Many thanks also to Regina Barzilay, Raymond Mooney, and Martin Cooke for accepting to present an invited lecture and thereby increase the appeal of this event even more. As in previous years, the selection of the workshops of all ACL conferences in the same year is coordinated in a single committee. For EACL, Kristiina Jokinen and Alessandro Moschitti collaborated with the NAACL and ACL chairs in reviewing and selecting the workshops. As EACL is the first conference of the three, they had to initiate the call for proposals and activate their colleagues long before they were planning to. Thanks to their professionalism and efficiency, the process went very smoothly, and the resulting workshops program reflects the diversity and maturity of the field. For even more variation during the first two days of the conference, we also have a strong tutorial program. Tutorial Chairs Lieve Macken and Eneko Agirre managed to attract an impressive list of high-quality submissions and performed a thorough and thoughtful review and selection. It is truly a pity only four could be accommodated in the program, but their quality and timeliness is inspiring. Many thanks to Kristiina, Alessandro, Lieve, and Eneko for making this important part of the scientific program such a success. As is previous editions of EACL, the Student Research Workshop was organized by the student members of the EACL board: Pierre Lison, Mattias Nilsson, and Marta Recasens, with help from faculty advisor Laurence Danlos. Their task was a huge one: to organize a mini-conference within the conference. This included finding reviewers, selecting papers, setting up a program for the student session, finding mentors for the accepted papers, selecting a best paper award, . . . The amount of work they did cannot be overestimated, and the result is brilliant. Thank you! To round of the scientific program, we have stimulating demonstration sessions, selected and coordinated by Demonstrations Chair Frédérique Segond. Thank you for showing so clearly the rapid progress application-oriented computational linguistics is making. Thanks also to Gertjan van Noord and Caroline Sporleder for accepting the role of coordinators of the mentoring service. In the end, they didn’t have to assign mentors, but it is important that such a service is available when needed. iii For EACL 2012 we decided to switch to digital proceedings only. They were available before the conference from the website, during the conference on the memory stick you received with your registration material, and afterwards from the website and the ACL Anthology. An exception was made for the tutorial notes, which are available to participants on paper as well. I warned the Publications Chairs, Adrià de Gispert and Fabrice Lefèvre, beforehand that theirs was probably the most demanding and stressful task of the conference: making sure that huge volumes of material from so many sources are available in time and in the right format, incorporating last minute corrections, and handling unavoidable glitches in the publications software. It is a formidable task, but they completed it without flinching. We all owe them our gratitude. EACL seems to follow economical crises, let us hope it does not become a habit. Both the previous conference in 2009 and the current one happened in grim economical times. Being a Sponsorship Chair is not a happy occasion in such times. Nevertheless, both the international ACL Sponsorship Committee (with Massimiliano Ciaramita as EACL member) and the local Sponsorship Chairs (Eric SanJuan and Stéphane Huet) left no stone unturned looking for sponsors. We would have ended up in a much worse financial situation if it hadn’t been for their efforts. Thank you! And of course also many thanks to our sponsors who, despite the economic situation, decided to help us financially with the conference. I am convinced their investment will be rewarded. Organizing large conferences like this is a complex undertaking, even with the help of extensive material (the ACL conference handbook). Whenever in doubt, I have had the opportunity to interact with the EACL Board, and occasionally with the ACL Board and with Priscilla Rasmussen. This has always been a pleasure. I have learned that the people running our associations are dedicated, know everything, and never sleep. Last but not least, the local organizing team has had to carry the largest burden in the organization. The sheer number of tasks and actions the local organizers of a conference like EACL have to assume is astonishing. Marc El-Beze has been a wonderful chair and his team (Frederic Bechet, Yann Fernandez, Stéphane Huet, Tania Jimenez, Fabrice Lefevre, Georges Linares, Alexis Nasr, Eric SanJuan, and Iria Da Cunha) has done outstanding work. There is no beginning in mentioning the many tasks they had to fulfill for making this a top conference. I am very grateful for all the work they put in the event and for the stress-free and friendly cooperation. I am also grateful for the support of the University of Avignon. I hope you will have many fond memories of EACL 2012, organized in these stunning surroundings in Avignon, both about the exciting scientific program and about the superb social program and local arrangements.

EACL 2012 received 326 submissions. We were able to accept 85 papers in total (an acceptance rate of 26%). 48 of the papers (14.7%) were accepted for oral presentation, and 34 (10.4%) for poster presentation. One oral paper was subsequently withdrawn after acceptance. The papers were selected by a program committee of 28 area chairs, from Asia, Europe, and North America, assisted by a panel of 471 reviewers. Each submission was reviewed by three reviewers, who were furthermore encouraged to discuss any divergences they might have, and the papers in each area were ranked by the area chairs. The final selection was made by the program co-chairs after an independent check of all reviews and discussions with the area chairs. This year EACL introduced an author response period. Authors were able to read and respond to the reviews of their paper before the program committee made a final decision. They were asked to correct factual errors in the reviews and answer questions raised in the reviewers comments. The intention was to help produce more accurate reviews. In some cases, reviewers changed their scores in view of the authors response and the area chairs read all responses carefully prior to making recommendations for acceptance. Another new feature was to allow authors to include optional supplementary material in addition to the paper itself (e.g., code, data sets, and resources). Finally, in an attempt to eliminate any bias from the reviewing process we put in place a double-blind reviewing system where the identity of the authors was not revealed to the area chairs. After the program was selected, each of the area chairs was asked to nominate the best paper from his or her area, or to explicitly decline to nominate any. This resulted in several nominations out of which three stood out and were further considered in more detail by an dedicated committee chaired by Stephen Clark. This independent committee selected the best paper of the conference, which will be also awarded with a prize sponsored by Google. The best paper and the other two finalists will be presented in plenary sessions at the conference. In addition to the main conference program, EACL 2012 will feature the now traditional Student Research Workshop, 10 workshops, 4 tutorials and a demo session with 21 presentations. We are also fortunate to have three invited speakers, Martin Cooke, Ikerbasque (Basque Foundation for Science), Regina Barzilay, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Raymond Mooney, University of Texas at Austin. Martin Cooke will speak about “Speech Communication in the Wild”, Regina Barzilay will discuss the topic of “Learning to Behave by Reading”, and Raymond Mooney will present on “Learning Language from Perceptual Context”. First and foremost, we would like to thank the authors who submitted their work to EACL. The sheer number of submissions reflects how broad and active our field is. We are deeply indebted to the area chairs and the reviewers for their hard work. They enabled us to select an exciting program and to provide valuable feedback to the authors. We are grateful to our invited speakers who graciously agreed to give talks at EACL. Additional thanks to the Publications Chairs, Adrià de Gispert and Fabrice Lefèvre who put this volume together. We are grateful to Rich Gerber and the START team who always responded to our questions quickly, and helped us manage the large number of submissions smoothly. Thanks are due to the local organizing committee chair, Marc El-Beze for his cooperation with us over many organisational issues. We are also grateful to the Student Research Workshop chairs, Pierre Lison, Mattias Nilsson, and Marta Recasens, and the NAACL-HLT (Srinivas Bangalore, Eric Fosler-Lussier and Ellen Riloff) and ACL (Chin-Yew Lin and Miles Osborne) program chairs for their smooth collaboration in the handling of double submissions. Last but not least, we are indebted to the v General Chair, Walter Daelemans, for his guidance and support throughout the whole process. We hope you enjoy the conference!
