Over the last decade, a variety of SMT algorithms have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the computational complexity of some of the fundamental problems of SMT. Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the computational complexity of those problems. We prove that while IBM Models 1-2 are conceptually and computation-ally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful) models are hard. Since it is unlikely that there exists a polynomial time solution for any of these hard problems (unless P = NP and P#P","= P), our results highlight and justify the need for developing polynomial time approximations for these computations. We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with complexity."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Statistical Machine Translation is a data driven machine translation technique which uses probabilistic models of natural language for automatic translation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999). The parameters of the models are estimated by iterative maximum-likelihood training on a large parallel corpus of natural language texts using the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993). The models are then used to decode, i.e. translate texts from the source language to the target language 1","(Tillman, 2001), (Wang, 1997), (Germann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004). The models are independent of the language pair and therefore, can be used to build a translation system for any language pair as long as a parallel corpus of texts is available for training. Increasingly, parallel corpora are becoming available for many language pairs and SMT systems have been built for French-English, German-English, Arabic-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English and other language pairs (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999), (Udupa, 2004).","In SMT, every English sentence e is considered as a translation of a given French sentence f with probability P r (f |e). Therefore, the problem of translating f can be viewed as a problem of finding the most probable translation of f : e∗","= argmax","e","P r(e|f ) = argmax e P r(f |e)P (e).","(1)","The probability distributions P r(f |e) and P r(e) are known as translation model and language model respectively. In the classic work on SMT, Brown and his colleagues at IBM introduced the notion of alignment between a sentence f and its translation e and used it in the development of translation models (Brown et al., 1993). An alignment between f = f1 . . . fm and e = e1 . . . el is a many-to-one mapping a : {1, . . . , m} → {0, . . . , l}. Thus, an alignment a between f and e associates the french word fj to the English word eaj 2",". The number of words of f mapped to ei by a is called the fertility of ei and is denoted by φi. Since P r(f |e) =","∑","a P r(f , a|e), equation 1 can 1 In this paper, we use French and English as the prototyp-","ical examples of source and target languages respectively. 2 e0 is a special word called the null word and is used to","account for those words in f that are not connected by a to","any of the words of e. 25 be rewritten as follows:","e∗ = argmax","e ∑ a P r(f , a|e)P r(e). (2)","Brown and his colleagues developed a series of 5 translation models which have become to be known in the field of machine translation as IBM models. For a detailed introduction to IBM translation models, please see (Brown et al., 1993). In practice, models 3-5 are known to give good results and models 1-2 are used to seed the EM iterations of the higher models. IBM model 3 is the prototypical translation model and it models P r(f , a|e) as follows: P (f , a|e) ≡ n ( φ0|","∑l i=1 φi",") ∏l i=1 n (φi|ei) φi! ×","∏m j=1 t ( fj|eaj ) ×","∏ j: aj̸=0 d (j|i, m, l) Table 1: IBM Model 3","Here, n(φ|e) is the fertility model, t(f |e) is the lexicon model and d(j|i, m, l) is the distortion model.","The computational tasks involving IBM Models are the following:","• Viterbi Alignment Given the model parameters and a sentence pair (f , e), determine the most probable alignment between f and e.","a∗ = argmax","a P (f , a|e)","• Expectation Evaluation This forms the core of model training via the EM algorithm.

Expectation Evaluation is the soul of parameter estimation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999). Conditional Probability computation is important in experimentally studying the concentration of the probability mass around the Viterbi alignment, i.e. in determining the goodness of the Viterbi alignment in comparison to the rest of the alignments. Decoding is an integral component of all SMT systems (Wang, 1997), (Tillman, 2000), (Och et al., 2001), (Germann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004). Exact Decoding is the original decoding problem as defined in (Brown et al., 1993) and Relaxed Decoding is the relaxation of the decoding problem typically used in practice.","While several heuristics have been developed by practitioners of SMT for the computational tasks involving IBM models, not much is known about the computational complexity of these tasks. In their seminal paper on SMT, Brown and his colleagues highlighted the problems we face as we go from IBM Models 1-2 to 3-5(Brown et al., 1993) 3 :","“As we progress from Model 1 to Model 5, evaluating the expectations that gives us counts becomes increasingly difficult. In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models. In practice, we are never sure that we have found the Viterbi alignment”.","However, neither their work nor the subsequent research in SMT studied the computational complexity of these fundamental problems with the exception of the Decoding problem. In (Knight, 1999) it was proved that the Exact Decoding problem is NP-Hard when the language model is a bigram model.","Our results may be summarized as follows: 3 The emphasis is ours. 26","1. Viterbi Alignment computation is NP-Hard for IBM Models 3, 4, and 5.","2. Expectation Evaluation in EM Iterations is #P-Complete for IBM Models 3, 4, and 5.","3.

We formally define all the problems discussed in the paper (Section 2). Next, we take up each of the problems discussed in this section and derive the stated result for them (Section 3).

Thus, given an alignment we can compute its encoding and given the encoding we can compute the corresponding alignment in time polynomial in l and m. Similarly, given an encoding we can compute P (f , a|e) in time polynomial in l and m. Now, if p(.) is a polynomial, then function f (f , e) = ∑","w∈{0,1}∗ |w|≤p(|⟨f, e⟩|) P (f , a|e) is in #P.

The evaluation of expectations becomes increasingly difficult as we go from IBM Models 1-2 to Models 3-5 exactly because the problem is #P-Complete for the latter models. There cannot be any trick for IBM Models 3-5 that would help us carry out the sums over all possible alignments exactly. There cannot exist a closed form expression (whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e) and the counts in the EM iterations for Models 3-5.","It should be noted that the computation of Viterbi Alignment and Expectation Evaluation is easy for Models 1-2. What makes these computations hard for Models 3-5? To answer this question, we observe that Models 1-2 lack explicit fertility model unlike Models 3-5. In the former models, fertility probabilities are determined by the lexicon and alignment models. Whereas, in Models 3-5, the fertility model is independent of the lexicon and alignment models. It is precisely this freedom that makes computations on Models 3-5 harder than the computations on Models 1-2.","There are three different ways of dealing with the computational barrier posed by our problems. The first of these is to develop a restricted fertility model that permits polynomial time computations. It remains to be found what kind of parameterized distributions are suitable for this purpose. The second approach is to develop provably good approximation algorithms for these problems as is done with many NP-Hard and #P-Hard problems. Provably good approximation algorithms exist for several covering problems including Set Cover and Vertex Cover. Viterbi Alignment is itself a special type of covering problem and it remains to be seen whether some of the techniques developed for covering algorithms are useful for finding good approximations to Viterbi Alignment. Similarly, there exist several techniques for approximating the permanent of a matrix. It needs to be explored if some of these ideas can be adapted for Expectation Evaluation.","As the third approach to deal with complexity, we can approximate the space of all possible (l + 1)m","alignments by an exponentially large subspace. To be useful such large subspaces should also admit optimal polynomial time algorithms for the problems we have discussed in this paper. This is exactly the approach taken by (Udupa, 2005) for solving the decoding and Viterbi alignment problems. They show that very efficient polynomial time algorithms can be developed for both Decoding and Viterbi Alignment problems. Not only the algorithms are provably superior in a computational complexity sense, (Udupa, 2005) are also able to get substantial improvements in BLEU and NIST scores over the Greedy decoder."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["IBM models 3-5 are widely used in SMT.
