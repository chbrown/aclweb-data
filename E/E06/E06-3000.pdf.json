Following the tradition of providing a forum for student researchers and the success of the previous workshops held in Bergen (1999), Toulouse (2001) and Budapest (2003), a panel of senior researchers will take part in the presentation of the papers, providing detailed comments on the work of the authors.","The Student Workshop will run as three parallel sessions, during which 9 papers will be presented. These high standard papers were carefully chosen from a total of 33 submissions coming from about 15 countries.","We would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people that have contributed in various ways to the success of the Student Workshop: the members of the Programme Committee for their evaluation of the submissions and for taking the time to provide useful detailed comments and suggestions for the improvement of papers; the panelists for providing detailed feedback directly; and the students for their hard work in preparing their submissions.","We are also very grateful to the EACL for providing sponsorship for students who would otherwise be unable to attend the workshop and present their work. And finally, thanks to those who have given us advice and assistance in planning this workshop (especially Chris Callison-Burch, Anette Frank, Alberto Lavelli, Diana McCarthy, Gertjan van Noord and Stephen Wan).","We hope you enjoy the Student Research Workshop.
