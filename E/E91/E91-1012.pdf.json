Box 80.000, 5600 JA Eindhoven, The Netherlands E-mail:leermake@rosetta.prl.philips.nl ABSTRACT A purely functional implementation of LR-parsers is given, together with a simple correctness proof. It is presented as a generalization of the recursive descent parser. For non-LR grammars the time-complexity of our parser is cubic if the functions that constitute the parser are implemented as memo-functions, i.e. functions that memorize the results of previous invocations. Memo-functions also facilitate a simple way to construct a very compact representation of the parse forest. For LR(0) grammars, our algorithm is closely related to the recursive ascent parsers recently discovered by Kruseman Aretz [1] and Roberts [2]. Extended CF grammars (grammars with regular expressions at the right hand side) can be parsed with a simple modification of the LR-parser for normal CF grammars."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we give a purely functional implementation of LR-parsers, applicable to general CF grammars. It will be obtained as a generalization of the well-known recursive descent parsing technique. For LR(0) grammars, our result implies a deterministic parser that is closely related to the recursive ascent parsers discovered by Kruseman Aretz [1] and Roberts [2]. In the general non-deterministic case, the parser has cubic time complexity if the parse functions are implemented as memo-functions [3], which are functions that memorize and re-use the results of previous invocations. Memo-functions are easily implemented in most programming languages. The notion of memo-functions is also used to define an algorithm that constructs a cubic representation for the parse forest, i.e. the collection of parse trees.","It has been claimed by Tomita that non-deterministic LR-parsers are useful for natural language processing. In [4] he presented a discussion about how to do non-deterministic LR-parsing, with a device called a graphstructured stack. With our parser we show that no explicit stack manipulations are needed; they can be expressed implicitly with the use of appropriate programming language concepts.","Most textbooks on parsing do not include proper correctness proofs for LR-parsers, mainly because such proofs tend to be rather involved. The theory of LR-parsing should still be considered underdeveloped, for this reason. Our presentation, however, contains a surprisingly simple correctness proof. In fact, this proof is this paper's major contribution to parsing theory. One of its lessons is that the CF grammar class is often the natural one to proof parsers for, even if these parsers are devoted to some special class of grammars. If the grammarlis restricted in some way, a parser for general CF grammars may have properties that enable smart implementation tricks to enhance efficiency. As we show be-low, the relation between LR-parsers and LR-grammars is of this kind.","Especially in natural language processing, standard CF grammars are often too limited in their strong generative power. The extended CF grammar formalism, allowing rules to have regular expressions at the right hand side, is a useful extension, for that reason. It is not difficult to generalize our parser to cope with extended grammars, although the application of LR-parsing to extended CF grammars is well-known to be problematic"]},{"title":"[5].","paragraphs":["We first present the recursive descent recognizer in a way that allows the desired generalization. Then we obtain the recursive ascent recognizer and its proof. If the grammar is LR(0) a few implementation tricks lead to the recursive ascent recognizer of ref. [1]. Subsequently, the time and space complexities of the recognizer are analysed, and the algorithm for constructing a cubic representation for parse forests is given. The paper ends with a discussion of extended CF grammars."]},{"title":"2 Recursive descent","paragraphs":["Consider CF grammar G, with terminals VT and non-terminals V/v. Let V = VN U VT.

We use the unorthodox embracing operator [.] to map each item to its function: (we use greek letters for arbitrary elements of V*) [A -~ a.~] : N --. 2 N where N is the set of integers, or a subset (0...nm~x), with nma= the maximum seutence length.

Also the arguments of the functions are superfluous now. The rble of argument i can be played by the global variable with the same na__.rne, and lhs(R)can be used instead of argument B of [q].

The same is true of the ascent recognizer for LR(0) grammars.

Memo-functions memorize for which arguments they have been called. If a function is called with the same arguments as before, the function returns the previous result without recomputing it. In conventional programming languages memo-functions are not available, but they can easily be implemented.

There are non-cyclic grammars that suffer from such a cycle (e.g."]},{"title":"S --* SSb,","paragraphs":["S --* e). Hence, the ascent parser does not terminate if the grammar is cyclic or if it leads to a cycle of transitions labeled b_.~ non-terminals that derive e. Otherwise, execution of [q](B, i) can only lead to calls of [p](i) with p ~ q and to calls of [q](C,k), such that either k > i or C--** BAC ~ B. As there are only finitely many such p, C, the parser terminates. Note that both the recursive descent and ascent recognizer terminate for any grammar, if the recognizer functions are implemented as memo-functions with the property that a call of a function with some arguments yields $ while it is under execution. For instance, if execution of [q](i) leads to a call of itself, the second call is to yield ~. A remark of this kind, for the recursive descent parser, was first made in ref. [8]. The recursive descent parser then becomes virtually equivalent to a version of the standard Earley algorithm [9] that stores items A ---* a./~ in parse matrix entry Ti i if/~ ---,* xi+l...xi, instead of storing it if a --*° x~+l...xj.","The space required for a parser that also calculates a parse forest, is dominated by this forest. We show in the next section that it may be compressed into a cubic amount of space. In the complexity domain our ascent parser beats its rival, Tomita's parsing method [4], which is non-polynomial: for each integer k there exists a grammar such that the complexity of the Tomita parser is worse than n k.","In addition to the complexity as a function of sentence length, one may also consider the complexity as a function of grammar size. It is clear that both time and space complexity are proportional to the number of parsing procedures. The number of procedures of the recursive descent parser is proportional to the number of items, and hence a linear function of the grammar size. The recursive ascent parser, however, contains two functions for each LR-state and is hence proportional to the size of the canonical collection of LR(0) states. In the worst case, this size is an exponential function of grammar size, but in the average natural language case there seems to be a linear, or even sublinear, dependence [4]."]},{"title":"6 Parse forest","paragraphs":["Usually, the recognition process is followed by the construction of parse trees.

In the deterministic case, the analysis of section 4 can be repeated with one exception: extended grammar items can not be represented by a non-terminal and an integer that equals the number of symbols before thc dot, as this notion is irrelevant in the case of regular expressions. In standard presentations of deterministic LR-parsing this leads to almost unsurmountable problems [5]."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We established a very simple and elegant implementation of LR(0) parsing. It is easily extended to LALR(k) parsing by letting the functions [q] produce pairs with final items only after inspection of the next k input symbols.","The functional LR-parser provides a high-level view of LR-parsing, compared to conventional implementations. A case in point is the ubiquitous stack, that simply corresponds to the procedure stack in the functional case. As the proof of a functional LR-parser is not hindered by unnecessary implementation details, it can be very compact. Nevertheless, the functional implementation is as efficient as conventional ones. Also, the notion of memo-functions is an important primitive for present-ing algorithms at a level of abstraction that can not be achieved without them, as is exemplified by this paper's presentation of both the recognizers and the parse forests.","For non-LR grammars, there is no reason to use the complicated Tomita algorithm. If indeed non-deterministic LR-parsers beat the Earley algorithm for some natural language grammars, as claimed in [4], this is because the number of LR(0) states may be smaller than the size of IG for such grammars. Evidently, for the grammars examined in [4] this advantage compensates the loss of efficiency caused by the non-polynomiality of Tomita's algorithm. The present algorithm seems to have the possible advantage of Tomita's parser, while being polynomial.
