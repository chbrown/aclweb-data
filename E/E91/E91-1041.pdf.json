The proposed approach uses a dialogue manager as the overall control mechanism. The dialogue manager accesses domain independent resources for interpretation, generation and background system access. It also uses information from domain dependent knowledge sources, which are customized for various applications.","Instead of using complex plan-based reasoning, the dialogue manager uses information about possible interaction structures and information from the specific dialogue situation to manage the dialogue. This is motivated from the analysis of a series of experiments where users interacted with a simulated natural language interface. The dialogue manager integrates information about segment types and moves into a hierarchical dialogue tree. The dialogue tree is accessed through a scoreboard which uses exchangeable access functions. The control is distributed and the dialogue is directed from action plans in the nodes in the dialogue tree."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["To achieve true cooperation a natural language interface must be able to participate in a coherent dialogue with the user. A common, generally applicable'approach is to use plan-inference as a basis for reasoning:about intentions of the user as proposed by, for instance, Allen & Perrault (1980), Litman (1986), Carberry (1989) and Pollack (1986). However, computationally these approaches are not so efficient.","Reichman (1985) describes a discourse grammar based on the assumption that a conversation can be described using conventionalized discourse rules. Gilbert, Buckland, Frolich, Jirotka & Luff (1990) uses interaction rules in their menu-based advisory system. Our approach is similar to Reichman and Gilbert el al. In a series of experiments (Dahlb~lck & JOnsson, 1989, J0nsson & Dahib/tck, 1988) we studied dialogue behaviour in an information-seeking interaction between a human and a computer using a simulated natural language interface (NLI). One important result was that the users followed a rather straightforward information searching strategy which could be well described using conventionalized rules.","Reichman uses surface linguistic phenomena for recognizing how the speaker's structure the discourse. We found, however, very little use of surface linguistic cues in our dialogues. In our corpus users normally initiate a request for information, which is followed by an answer from the system. Sometimes the request needs clarifica, tion before the answer can be given as a response to the initial question (this is illustrated in section 4 and 5). Op. tionally the user can interrupt the original question and start a new initiative-response unit, but this also follows the goals of information-seeking. Thus, we adopt a strat, egy in which we employ the notion of adjacency pairs (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973, see also Levinson, 1983: 3030. In our approach the dialogue is planned and utterances are interpreted in terms of speech acts. The speech acts are determined on the basis of structural information in the utterance and in the immediate context.","Further, we found, in our experiments, that different configurations of the background system (e.g. data base, consultation) and task to solve (e.g. information retrieval, configuration) require different mechanisms for handling dialogue in an NLI (JOnsson, 1990). Therefore, one major design criterion is that the system should be easy to adapt (customiZe) to a new application.","The natural language interface described in this paper is constructed on the assumption that different applications have different sublanguages (Grishman & Kittredge, 1987), i.e. subsets of a natural language. A sub-language is not only defined by a grammar and lexicon, but also by interaction behaviour, i.e factors such as how the user and system handle clarifications, who takes the initiative, what is cooperative in a certain application, what are the user categories and so on.","The dialogue manager operates as the central control. ler in the NLI (Ahrenberg, Dahlb/tck & J6nsson, 1990). It passes information encoded in directed acyclic graphs (dags) between different modules for parsing, generation, etc. This paper, however, only describes the dialogue manager's role in the control of the dialogue. I assume that the dag's correctly describe the full meaning of the user's input. For a discussion of interpretation of user input in this system see Ahrenberg (1988). The dialogue manager is implemented in CommonLisp but is currently not completely integrated with the other modules of the system. - 233 -"]},{"title":")","paragraphs":["Figure 1. Overview of the architecture"]},{"title":"2 The dialogue manager","paragraphs":["The dialogue manager (DM) is the kernel in the natural language interface, see figure 1. It directs the dialogue, assists the instantiator and deep generator and communicates with the background system. DM can be viewed as a controller of resources and knowledge sources.","The resources in our system are a chart parser (Wir6n, 1988), an instantiator which links the linguistic object descriptions to objects in the universe of discourse (Ahrenberg, 1989), a translator which translates the instantiated structures in|o a form suitable for accessing the background system\" and finally a deep and a surface generator for generating a system utterance. These resources are domain independent processes accessing various knowledge sources.","The knowledge sources are domain dependent and implemented in the same knowledge base system and can be modified for each new application. We use a lexicon for general and domain-specific\" vocabulary and a grammar with knowledge of syntactic constructions and their semantic impact. Furthermore, we use descriptions of dialogue objects, i.e. segments and moves and their associated information (section 3) and domain object descriptions which contain relations between the concepts used to describe objects in the background system and constraints on them.","The need for domain object information in a natural language database interface has been argued for by for instance Copestake & Sparck Jones (1990) and McCoy & Cheng (1988). The domain objects are primarily used by the instantiator and deep generator, but the translator, parser and surface generator can also use this information. For a discussion on domain objects in this system see Ahrenberg, J6nsson & Dahlb~ick (1990).","Each input or output from the resources passes via the dialogue manager (DM). A typical segment begins with an input from the user that is sent to the DM which l. Initially we use only a relational database system. passes it to the parser. The parser sends its result to the DM which passes it to the instantiator where it is enhanced with referential information. This is sent to the translator which accesses the background system and if the access succeeds, informs the DM. The DM forwards the information to the deep generator where an enhanced description is created which is sent to the surface generator and finally a. response is given from the DM to the user. This has the advantage that the DM always has control over what happens in the system. Thus, if one module does not succeed with its task, the DM directs the recovery. For instance, if the translator cannot access the data base due to lack of information from the user, the DM receives information from the translator that there is information missing and then in turn calls the deep and surfac.~ generators to produce a suitable message to the user. The DM then waits for input to provide to the parser and: instantiator. Finally, the DM tries to integrate the new information with the previous information.","Internally the dialogue manager maintains three dynamic structures for monitoring the dialogue: the dialogue tree (section 4) where the dialogue history is kept, action plans (section 5) for controlling the dialogue and finally a scoreboard (section 6) which constitutes the interface between the dialogue tree and other modules of the system."]},{"title":"3 Dialogue objects","paragraphs":["Dialogue objects play a central role in this architecture. The dialogue objects consist of two components, one is a process :description of a prototypicaf use of the dialogue object. This is described below. The other conrains static reformation about speaker, hearer, type, topic, context and different types of descriptors to describe salient objects, e.g. the focused object, potential focused objects and optionally the current set. The current set records which subset of the data base that is currently used. We found in our data base dialogues that the user often restricts the possible candidates in a database - 234 - search.

For instance, in a travel data base the user may be interested in a trip to Greek islands which restricts the search in the database to Greek islands for a large part of the ensuing dialogue.","The communication is hierarchically structured using three different categories of dialogue objects. There are various proposals as to the number of levels needed. The system developed by Polanyi & Scha (1984) uses five different levels to hierarchically structure a dialogue and LOKI (Wachtel, 1986) uses four. In LOKI the levels are: conversation, dialogue, exchange and move. When analysing our dialogues we found no certain criteria concerning how to divide a dialogue into'a set of exchanges. Therefore we only use three different dialogue object types: dialogue, initiative-response-unit (IR) and move. Dialogue, in our notation, is similar to conversation in LOKI, while IR-units resemble exchanges. IR-units are recursive and, unlike LOKI, we allow arbitrary embedding of IR-units.","The smallest unit handled by our dialogue manager is the move. An utterance can consist of more than one move and is thus regarded as a sequence of moves. A move object is used for describing information about a move. Moves are categorized according to the type of il-Iocutionary act and topic. Some typical move types are: Question (Q), Assertion (AS), Answer (A) and Directive (DI). Topic describes which knowledge source to consuit: the background system, i.e. solving a task (T), the ongoing dialogue (D) or the organisation of the back-I. The dialogue is an English translation of a dialogue from our corpus of Swedish dialogues collected in Wizard-of-Oz simulations. It is continued in section 4. ground system (S). For brevity when we refer to a move with its associated topic, the move type is subscribed with topic, e.g. Qr.","• Normally an exchange of information begins with an initiative followed by a response (IR). The initiative can come from the system or the user. A typical IR-unit in a question-answer database application is a task-related question followed by a successful answer Qr/A-r. Other typical IR-units are: Qs/As for a clarification request from the user, Qr/ASs when the requested information is not in the database, Q~/A o for questions about the ongoing dialogue.","• The dialogue:manager uses a dialogue tree (section 4) as: control structure. The root node is of type Dialogue (the D-node) and controls the overall interaction. When an IR-unit is finished it returns control to the D-node. The D-node creates an instance of a new IR-unit with information about initiator and responder. It also copies relevant information about salient objects and attributes from the previous IR-unit to the new one. Our simula. ti0ns show that users prefer coherence in the dialogue. Thus, we use the heuristic that no information explicitly changed is duplicated from one IR-unit to the next.","As stated above, an instance of a dialogue object has one component describing static information about initiator, responder, salient objects etc., and another describing the process, i.e. the actions performed when executing the object. We call this a plan, although if we were to follow Pollack (1990) we could call it recipe-for-actions. Figure 2 shows a template description for an IR-unit used in a database information-seeking application."]},{"title":"\"Class: IR Topic: Tv D v S Context:","paragraphs":["link to father"]},{"title":"Initiator:","paragraphs":["System v User"]},{"title":"Responder:","paragraphs":["System v User"]},{"title":"Type:","paragraphs":["type of/R-unit e.g. Q/A"]},{"title":"Initiative type: e.g. O Response type:","paragraphs":["e.g. A"]},{"title":"Turns:","paragraphs":["list of daughter nodes CurrentObject:"]},{"title":"CurrentAttribute: CurrentSet: CurrentRequest: I[nitiator = User~ ---> ll~ocess: ((create-move user) \"7 | (access) | / (create-move system) I L_ (up)) Enitiator = System~-> P~ocess: ((create-move system)i | (create-move user) L (up))","paragraphs":["-- ,-= Figure 2. A template description for IR-units","The static component forms the context in which the processes are executed. The attributes are updated with new values during the execution of the action plan. For instance, a user IR-unit, i.e. an IR-unit which waits for a user initiative to be interpreted, has no value for the Initiative and Response slots until the initiative has been interpreted. This is discussed further in section 4.","The process component of the IR-unit is divided into two different plan descriptions, one if the system initiate d the segment and another for a user-initiated segment. - 235 - However, as can be seen in figure 2, they use the same general actions for creating moves, acting and traversing the tree (up). The actions behave differently depending on the static description, for instance the action (access) uses the value of the slot Topic to determine which knowledge source to consult. Information about values of attributes describing the request for information is found in the dag structure delivered by the instantiator which is passed to the translator by the dialogue manager. The slot CurrontRequost contains the request formed by the translator and is used for clarifications.","In database applications the system behaves as a user-directed interface. It initiates an IR-unit only for clarification requests, either because 1) difficulties arise when interpreting the utterance, or 2) difficulties arise when accessing the data base, e.g. when the user needs to provide a parameter for correct access, see S17> in example 2 below, or finally 3) if difficulties arise in the presentation of the result from the data base access. The action to take after a clarification request is first to check the validity of the response and then to propagate the information to the node which initiated the clarification.","In other applications, e.g. tutoring or consultation systems, the behaviour need not be user-directed. Instead it may be system-directed or mixed initiative. In our approach this is achieved by customizing the dialogue objects, section 7.","For move-units there are two different process descriptions, one for user moves and one for system moves. The user move has the plan ((parse) (instantiate) (up)) and the system move has the plan ((deep-generate)"]},{"title":"(surface-generate) (up)). 4 The dialogue tree","paragraphs":["The dialogue tree represents the dialogue as it develops in the interaction. Information about salient objects is represented in the dialogue tree and is used by the instantiator and deep generator. The dialogue manager updates the dialogue tree for each new move.","An important feature of the dialogue manager is distributed control. Every node in the tree is responsible for its own correctness. For instance, the plan for a task related question-answer, Or/AT, contains no reparation strategies for missing information to the background system. If the interpreter fails to access the data base due to lack of information, the translator signals this to the DM which creates an instance of an IR-unit for a clarification request and inserts it into the Or/AT. The plan for clarificauon request then generates a move explaining the missing information and creates a user move waiting for the user input. This has the advantage that theplans are very simple, as they only have local scope, cf. sections 3 and 6. Furthermore, the plans are more generally applicable.

This is illustrated in the dialogue in example 2, which will generate a dialogue tree with clarifications on two levels.

The dialogue manager then updates the action plan of the current node with an action for creating an instance of a,clarification request dialogue object and another action'to integrate - 236 - new information.

For instance the lexicon for an SQL data base interface needs to be updated with data base content-specific terms but large parts of it are re-usable. Furthermore, we believe this to be possible not only for the lexicon and grammar, but also for the dialogue objects. The plans for a data base system will be much the same regardless of the domain.

The initiative-response category is recursive. Use of an initiative-response structure can be criticised in the same way as adjacency pairs for not adequately describing a naturally occurring discourse. However, for a restricted sublanguage, such as natural language communication with computers, we believe that this is a very efficient way of managing the dialogue (cf. Levinson 1981:114).","The dialogue history is represented in a dialogue tree consisting of instantiated dialogue objects. The resources access the dialogue tree through a scoreboard and thus need no mechanisms for traversing the tree.","We have conducted experiments which show that in an information-seeking human-computer dialogue the proposed mechanisms can correctly handle the dialogue.
