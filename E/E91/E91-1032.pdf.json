This entails that each module within the LCS apply concurrently.","The performance model is taken to be directly compatible with the modular, language universal, principle-based theory of current transformational grammar [3]. We further suggest a highly modular organisation of the sentence processor wherein modules are determined by the syntactic representations they recover.

With these two notions defined, the representation can be viewed as some recursive instance of its particular schema over a collection of nodes.","The representation of phrase structure (PS), as determined principally by ~'-theory, encodes the local, sister-hood relations and defines constituency.

The final rule (d) above, is simply the rule for lexical insertion. In addition to the canonical structures defined by ~--theory, we require additional rules to permit Chomsky-adjunction of phrases to maximal projections, via Move-~, and the rules for inserting traces (or more generally, empty categories) -- a consequence of the Projection Principle -- for moved heads and maximal projections.","Given the rules above, we can see that possible phrase structures are limited to some combination of binary (non-terminal) and unary (terminal) branches. As discussed above, we can characterise the representational framework in terms of nodes and schemas: 186 - Phrase Structure Schema","Node: N-Node: {Cat,Level, ID,Ftrs} T-Node: {Cat,Phon,ID,Ftrs}","Schema: Branch: N-N ode/IN-Node,N-Node] Branch: N-Node/T-Node","Structure: Tree: N-Node/[Treer.,TreeR] Tree: N-Node/T-Node","We allow two types of nodes: 1) non-terminals (N-Nodes), which are the nodes projected by X-theory, consisting of category, bar level, a unique ID, and the features projected from the head, and 2) terminals (T-Nodes), which are either lexical items or empty categories, which lack bar level, but posses phonological features (although these may be 'nil' for some empty categories). The schema, defines the unit of structure, using the '/' to represent immediate dominance, and square brackets '[... ]' to encode sister-hood and linear precedence. Using this notation we define the two possible types of branches, binary and unary, where the latter is applicable just in case the daughter is a terminal node. The full PS representation (or Tree) is defined by allowing non-terminal daughters to dominate a recursive instance of the schema. It is interesting to note that, for phrase structure at least, the relevant principles of grammar can be stated purely as conditions on branches, rather that trees. More generally, We will assume the schema of a particular representation provides a formal characterisation of locality.","Just as phrase structure is defined in terms of branches, we can define Chains as a sequence of links. More specifically, each position contained by the chain 'is a node, which represents its category and level (a phrase or a head), the status of that position (either A or A--), its ID (or location), and relevant features (such as L-marking, Case, and 0). If we adhere to the representational paradigm used above, we can define Chains in the following manner: Chain S chevaa Node: C-Node: {Cat,Level,Pos,ID,Ftrs} Schema: Link: <C-Nodei oo C-Nodej>","Structure: Chain: [ C-Node I Chain ] (where,","<C-Node oo head(Chain)> ) Chain: [ ]","If we let 'co' denote the linking of two C-Nodes, then we can define a Chain to be an ordered fist of C-Nodes, such that successive C-Nodes satisfy the link relation. In the above definition we have used the '1' operator and list notation in the standard Prolog sense. The 'head' function returns the first C-Node in a (sub) Chain (possibly [ ]), for purposes of satisfying the link relation. Furthermore, <C-Node co [ ]> is a well-formed link denoting the tail, Deep-Structure position, of a Chain. Indeed, if this is the only link in the Chain we refer to it as a 'unit' Chain, representing an unmoved element.","We noted above that each representation's schema provides a natural locality constraint. That is, we should be able to state relevant principles and constraints locally, in terms of the schematic unit. This clearly holds for Subjacency, a well-formedness condi-tion which holds between two nodes of a link:","(4) <C-Nodei co C-Nodej> ---, subjacent(C-Nodei,C-Nodej)","Other Chain conditions include the Case filter and 0-Criterion. The former stipulates that each NP Chain receive Case at the 'highest' A-position, while the latter entails that each argument Chain receive exactly one 0-role, assigned to the uniquely identifiable < C-Node# co [ ] > link in a Chain. It is therefore possible to enforce both of these conditions on locally identifiable links of a Chain:","(5) In an argument (NP) Chain, i) <C-Node- A- co C-NodeA>","case-mark(C-Nodea) or, ii) C-NodeA - head(Chain) --*","ease-mark(C-Nodea) In an argument Chain, <C-Nodes co []> --, theta-mark(C-Node0)","In describing the representation of a Chain, we have drawn upon Prolog's list notation. To carry this further, we can consider the link operator 'co' to be equivalent to the ',' separator in a list, such that for all [... C-Nodei,C-Nodej ... ], C-Nodei co C-NOdej holds. In this way, we ensure that each node is well-formed with respect to adjacent nodes (i.e. in accordance with principles such as those identified in (4) & (5)). 4 The Computational Model In the same manner that linguistic theory makes the distinction between competence (the grammar) and performance (the parser), logic programming distinguishes the declarative specification of a program from its execution. A program specification consists of a set of axioms from which solution(s) can be proved as derived theorems. Within this paradigm, the nature of computation is determined by the inferencing strategy employed by the theorem prover. This aspect of logic programming has often been exploited for parsing; the so called Parsing as Deduction hypothesis. In particular it has been shown that meta.interpreters or program transformations can be used to affect the manner in which a logic grammar is parsed [10] [1i],","Recently, there has been an attempt to extend .the PAD hypothesis beyond its application to simple logic grammars [14], [13] and [8]. In particular, Johnson has developed a prototype parser for a fragment of a GB grammar [9]. The system consists of a declarative specification of the GB model, which incorporates - 187-the various principles of grammar and multiple levels of representation. Johnson then illustrates how the fold/unfold transformation and goal"]},{"title":"freezing,","paragraphs":["when applied to various components of the grammar, can be used to render more or less efficient implementations. Unsurprisingly, this deductive approach to parsing in-herits a number of problems with automated deduc-tion in general. Real (implemented) theorem provers are, at least in the general case, incomplete. Indeed, we can imagine that a true, deductive implementation of GB would present a problem. Unlike traditional, homogeneous phrase structure grammars, GB makes use of abstract, modular principles, each of which may be relevant to only a particular type or level of representation. This modular, heterogeneous organisation therefore makes the task of deriving some single, specialised interpreter with adequate coverage and efficiency, a very difficult one."]},{"title":"4.1 Deduction in a Modular System","paragraphs":["In contrast with the single processor model employed by Johnson, the system we propose consists of a number of processors over subsets of the grammar. Central to the model is a declarative specification of the principles of grammar, defined in terms of the representations listed in (2), as described in §3. If we take this specification of the grammar to be the \"competence component\", then the \"performance component\" can be stated as a parse relation which maps the input string to a well-formed \"State\", where State = { PS,TS,ChS,CiS }, the 4-tuple constituting all aspects of syntactic analysis. The highest level of the parser specifies how each module may communicate with the others. Specifically, the PS processor acts as input to the other processors which construct their representations based on the PS representations and their own \"representation specific\" knowledge. In a weaker model, it may be possible for processors to in-spect the current State (i.e. the other representations) but crucially, no processor ever actually \"constructs\" another processor's representation. The communica-tion between modules is made explicit by the Prolog specification shown below: (6) parse(Lexlnput,State) :-","State = {PS,TS,ChS,CiS},","ts.module(PS,TS),","chs.xnodule(PS,ChS),","cis_module(PS,CiS),","ps_module(Lexlnput,PS).","The parse relation defines the organisation of the processors as shown in Figure 1.

Firstly, we posit several processors which logically exploit the grammar, and it is these processors which are coroutined, not the principles of grammar themselves. Each interpreter is responsible for recovering only one, homogeneous representation, with respect to one input representation. This makes reasoning about the computational behaviour of individual processors much easier. At each stage of processing, the individual procensors increment their representations if and only if, for :the current input, there is a \"theorem\" provable from the grammar, which permits the new structure to be added. This me[a-level \"parsing as deduction\" approach permits more finely tuned control of the parser as a whole, and allows us to specify distinct inferencing strategies for each interpreter, tailoring it to the particular representation. - 188-4.2 The PS-Module Specification Lexical ~ [ Interpreter for ~ PS-Tree Input Phrase Structure Output","!","PS-Vlew: Mother/[Left, Right] [ Mother/Terminal"]},{"title":"I X-Bar Theory","paragraphs":["XP\"~ Specifwr, X' X' ~ Modifuer, X ° X' \"~ Complemenzs, X X \"~Lexeme Move-alpha XP ~ Adjunct, XP XP ~ trace X \"~trace Figure 3: The Phrase Structure Module","We have illustrated in §3 that the various representations and grammatical principles may be defined in terms of their respective schematic units. Given this, the task of recovering representations (roughly parsing) is simply a matter of proving well-formed representations, as recursive instances of 'schematic axioms', i.e. those instantiations of a schema which are considered well-formed by the grammar. The form of the PS-Module can be depicted as in Figure 3. The PS interpreter incorporates lexical input into the phrase structure tree based on possible structures allowed by the grammar. Possible structures are determined by the ps_view relation, which returns those possible instantiations of the PS schema (as described in §3) which are well-formed with respect to the relevant principles of grammar. In general, ps_view will return any possible branch structure licensed by the grammar, but is usually constrained by partial instantiation of the query. In cases where multiple analyses are possible, the ps_view predicate may use some selection rule to choose between them 3. The following is a specification of the PS interpreter:","(9) ps_module(X-X0,Node/[L/LD,R/RD]) : - non_lexical(Node), ps.view(Node/[L,R]), ps_module(X-X1,L/LD), ps_module(Xl-X0,R/RD).","ps.module(X-X0,Node/Daughters) :- ps_ec.eval(X-X0,Node/Daughters).","ps.module(X-X0,Node/Daughters) :- psAex_e val( X- X O,N ode/ Daughters).","As we have discussed above, the ps..module is frozen on lexical input represented here as as difference-list. This is one way in which we might implement attachment principles to account for human preferences, see Crocker [4] for discussion. The top-level of the PS interpreter is broken down into three possible cases. The first handles non-lexicai nodes, i.e. those of category C or I, since phrase structure for these categories is not lexically determined, and can be derived 'top-down', strictly from the grammar. We can, for example, automatically hypothesize a Subject specifier and VP complement for Intl. The second clause deals with the postulation of empty categories, while the third can be considered the 'base' case which simply attaches lexical material. Roughly, ps.ec_eval attempts to derive a leaf which is a trace. This action is then verified by the concurrent Chain processor, which determines whether or not the trace is licensed (see the following section). This implements an approximation of the filler-driven strategy for identifying traces, a strategy widely accepted in the psycholinguistic literature 4. 4.3 The Chain-Module Specification Just as the phrase structure processor is delayed on lexical input, the chain processor is frozen with respect to phrase structure. The organisation of the Chain Module is shown in Figure 4, and is virtually identical to that of the PS Module (in Figure 3). However rather than recovering branches of phrase structure, it recovers links of chains, determining their well-formedness with respect to the relevant grammatical axioms.

At the highest level, we have a simple specification of the models organisation, in addition we have employed a 'freeze' control strategy which permits us to coroutine the individual processors, permitting maximal incremental interpretation. The individual processors consist of specialised interpreters which are in turn designed to perform incrementally. The interpreters construct their representations, by incrementally adding units of structure which are locally well-formed with respect to the principles of the module. The implementation is intended to allow some flexibility in specifying the grammatical principles, and varying the control strategies of various modules. It is possible that some instantiations of the syntactic theory will prove more or less compatible with the processing model. It is hoped that such results may point the way to a more unified theory of grammar and processing or will at least shed greater light on the nature of their relationship."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["I would like to thank Elisabet Engdahl and Robin Cooper for their comments on various aspects of this work.
