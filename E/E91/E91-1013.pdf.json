Mathews, Urbana, IL 61801, USA","tsuneko@grice.cogsci.uiuc.edu ABSTRACT","This paper proposes an LR parsing algorithm modified for grammars with feature-based categories. The proposed algorithm does not instantiate categories during preprocessing of a grammar as proposed elsewhere. As a result, it constructs a minimal size of GOTO/ACTION table and eliminates the necessity of search for GOTO table entries during parsing. 1 Introduction","The LR method is known to be a very efficient parsing algorithm that involves no searching or backtracking. However, recent formalisms for syntactic analyses of natural language make maximal use of complex feature-value systems, rather than atomic categories that have been presupposed in the LR method. This paper is an attempt to incorporate feature-based categories into Tomita's extended LR parsing algorithm (Tomita 1986).","A straightforwmd adaptation of feature-based categories into the algorithm introduces the necessity of partial instantiation of categories during preprocessing, of a grammar as well as a nontenmnat~on problem. Furthermore, the parser is forced to search through instantiated categories for desired GOTO table entries during parsing. The major innovations of the proposed algorithm include the construction of a minimal size of GOTO table that does not require any preliminary instantiation of categories or a search for them, and a reduce action which pe,forms instanliation tit)ring parsing.","Some details of the LR parsing algorithm are assumed from Aho and Ullman (1987) and Aho and Johnson (1974), and more formal definitions and notations of a feature-based grammar formalism from Pollard and Sag (1987) and Shieber (1986). 2 The LR Parsing Algorithm","The LR parser is an efficient shift-reduce parser with optional lookahead. Parse u'ees for input strings are built bottom-up, while predictions are made top-down prior to parsing. The ACTION/GOTO table is constructed during preprocessing of a grammar and deterministically guides the parser at each step during parsing. The ACFION table determines whether the parser should take a shift o1\" a reduce action next. The GOTO table determines the state the parser should be in after each action.","Henceforth, entries for the ACTION/ GOTO table are referred to as the values of functions, ACTION and GOTO. The ACTION function takes a current state and an input string to return a next action, and GOTO takes a previous state and a syntactic category to return a next state.","States of the LR parser are sets of dotted productions called items. The state, i.e. dotted productions, stored on top of the stack is called current state and the dot positions on the right hand side (rhs) of the productions indicate how much of the rhs the parser has found. Previous states are stored in the stack until the entire rhs, or the left hand side (lhs), of a production is found, at which time a reduce action pops previous states and pushes a new state in, i.e. the set of items - 69 - with a new dot position to the right, reflecting the discovery of the lhs of the production.","If a grammar contains two productions VP~V NP and NP~Det N, for example, then the state sl in Fig.l(i) (the state numbers are arbiu'ary) should contain the items <VP-oV. NP> and <NP-~.Det N> among others, after shifting an input string \"saw\" onto the stack. The latter item predicts strings that may follow in a top-down manner. sl"]},{"title":"v(saw) (i) s4 I I","paragraphs":["N(dog) ]"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["s13 I NP(d,et(a)N(dog)) I Pet(a)"]},{"title":"v(saw) v(saw)","paragraphs":["• o (ii) (iii) Figure 1: Stacks","After two morestrings are shifted, say \"a dog\", and the parser encounters the end-of-a-sentence symbol \"$\" (Fig.l(ii)), the next action, ACTION(s4,$), should be \"reduce by NP-~Det N\". The reduce action pops two states off the stack, and builds a constituent whose root is NP (Fig.l (iii)). At this point, GOTO(sI,NP) should be a next state that includes the item <vP~v NP. >.","The ACTION/GOTO table used in the above example can be constructed using the procedures given in Fig.2 (adapted flom Aho and Uliman (1987)). The procedure CLOSURE coml~utes all items in each state, and the procedure NEXT-S, given a state and a syntactic category, calculates the next state the parser should be in.","procedure CLOSURE(I);","begin repeat for each item <A~w.Bx> in I, and each production B-oy such that <B-o.y> is not m I do","add <B~.y>to I; until no more items can be added to I; return 1","end; procedure NEXT-S(I,B) ;for each category B in grammar begin","let J be the set of items <A-,wB.x>","such that <A~w.Bx> is in I;","return CLOSURE(J) end; Figure 2. CLOSURE/NEXT-S Procedures for Atomic Categories","It should be clear from the preceding example that upon the completion of all the constituents on the rhs of a production, the GOTO table entry for the lhs is consulted. Whether a category appears on the lhs or the rhs of productions is a trivial question, however, since in a grammar with atomic categories, every category that appears on the lhs also appears on the rhs and vice versa. On the other hand, in a grammar with feature-based categories, as proposed by most recent syntactic theories, it is no longer the case.","3 Construction of the GOTO Table for Feature-Based Categories: A Preliminary Modification","Fig.3 is an example production using feature-based syntactic categories. The notations are adapted from Pollard and Sag (1987) and Shieber (1986).

Items Created flom the Same Production in Figure 3","As can be seen in Fig.7, the procedure will add an infinite number of different instantiations of the same production to the state. The list of items in Fig.7 is not complete: each execution of the repeat-loop adds a new item from which a new prediction is made during the next execution. That is, instantiation of productions introduces the nontermination problem of left-recursive productions to the procedure, as well as to the Predictor Step of Earley's algorithm. To overcome this problem, Shieber (1985) proposes \"restrictor\", which specifies a maximum depth of feature-based categories. When the depth of a category in a predicted item exceeds the limit imposed by a restrictor, further instantiation of the category in new items is prohibited. The Predictor Step eventually halts when it starts creating a new item whose feature specification within the depth allowed by the resu'ictor is identical to, or subsumed by, a previous one.","In addition to the halting problem, the incorporation of feature-based syntactic categories to grammars poses a new problem unique to the LR parser. After the parser assigns a constituent structure in Fig.4 during parsing, it would consult the GOTO table for the next state with the root category of the constituent, i.e. vise [FST NP, RST NIL], TNS PAST]. There is no entry in the table under the root category, however, since the category is distinct from any categories that appear in the items partially intstantiated by the CLOSURE procedure.","The problem stems fi'om the fact that the categories which are partially instantiated by the preliminary CLOSURE procedure and consequently constitute the domain of the GOTO function may be still underspecified as com.pared with those that arise during parsing.

Furthermore, there may be more than one such category in the domain, giving rise to nondeterminism to the algorithm.","4 Construction of the GOTO Table for Feature-Based Categories: A Final Modification","The final version of CLOSURE/NEXT-S procedures in Fig.8 circumvents the described problems. While the CLOSURE procedure makes top-down predictions in the same way as before, new items are added without instantiation. Since only original productions in a grammar appear as items, productions are added as new items only once and the nontermination problem does not occur, as is the case of the LR parsing algorithm with atomic categories. The NEXT-S procedure constructs next states for the lhs category of each production, rather than the categories to the right of a dot. Consequently, from the lhs category of the production used for a reduce action, the parser can uniquely determine the GOTO table entry for a next state, while constructing a constituent structure by instantiating it. No search for unifiable categories is involved during parsing.","procedure CLOSURE(I);","begin repeat for each item <A-~w.Bx> in 1, and each production C~y such that C is unifiable with B and <C-~.y> is not in I do","add <C-~.y> to I; until no more items can be added to I; return 1","end;","procedure NEXT-S(I,C)",";for each category C on the lhs of productions","begin","let J be the set of items <A~wB.x> such","that <A-,w.Bx> is in I and B is unifiable","with C;","return CLOSURE(J)","end; Figure 8. Final CLOSURE/NEXT-S procedures","Note, furthermore, the size of GOTO table produced by the final CLOSURE/NEXT-S procedures is usually smaller than the table produced by the preliminary procedures for the same grammar. It is because the preliminary CLOSURE procedure creates one or more instantiations out of a single category, each of which the preliminary NEXT-S procedure applies to, creating separate GOTO table entries. Although a smaller GOTO table does not necessarily imply less parsing time, since there ale entry reu'ieval algorithms that do not depend on a table size, it does mean fewer operations to construct such tables during preprocessing. 5: Further Comparisons and Conclusion","The LR parsing algorithm for grammars with atomic categories involves no category matching during parsing. In Fig.l, catego~;ies are pushed onto the stack only for the purpose of constructing a paa'se tree, and reduce actions are completely independent of categories in the stack. In parsing with feature-based categories, on the other hand, the parser must perform unification operations between the roots of constituents and categories on the rhs of productions during a reduce action. In addition to en'or entries in the ACTION t~Dble, unification failure should result in an error also. Since categories cannot be completely instantiated in every possible way during preprocessing, unification operations during parsing cannot be eliminated. : What motivates partial instantiation of pJ'oductions during preprocessing as is done by the preliminary CLOSURE procedure, then? It can sometimes prevent wrong items from being predicted and consequently incorrect reduce actions from entering into an ACTION table.

The choice between two approaches depends upon particular grammars and is an empirical question. In general, however, a clear tendency among grammars written in recent linguistic theories is that productions tend to be more general and permissive and lexical specifications more specific and restrictive. That is, information that regulates possible configurations of parse trees for particular input strings comes from the bottom of trees, and not from the top, making top-down instantiation useless.","With the recent linguistic trend of lexiconoriented grammars, partial instantiation of categories while making predictions top-down gives little to gain for added costs.
