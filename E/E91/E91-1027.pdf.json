Introduction","paragraphs":["Parsing is a process by which an input sentence is not only recognized as belonging to the language, but is also assigned a structure. As [l]erwick/Wcinbcrg 84] commcnt, recognition per se (i.e. a weak generative capacity analysis) is not of much value for a theory of language understanding, but it can be useful \"as a diagnostic\". We claim that if an cfficient recognition procedure is availat~le, it can be tnost valuable as a prc-parsing reducer of lcxical ambiguity (especially, as [Milne 86] points out, for detcnninistic parsers), and cvcn more useful in applications where full parsing is not absolutely required - e.g. identification of iU-formed inputs in a text critique program. Still weaker than recognition procedures are 'methods which approximate the recognition capacity. This is the kind of methods that we discuss in this paper. More specifically, we analyze the recognition capacity of automata based on local (short context) considerations. In [Herz/Rimon 91] we prescnted our approach to the acquisition and usage of local syntactic constraints, focusing on its use for reduction of word-level ambiguity. After briefly reviewing this method in section 2 below, we examine in more detail various characteristics of the approximating automata, and suggest several applications."]},{"title":"2.

We use the term"]},{"title":"path","paragraphs":["to refer to a sequence of M tags (M~ N) which is a tag-image corresponding to the words W,..., WN of a given sentence S. This is motivated by a view of lexical mnbiguity as a graph problem: we try to reduce the number of tentative paths in ambiguous cases by removing arcs from the Sentence Graph (SG) - a directed graph with vertices for all tags in all cohorts of the words in the given sentence, and arcs connecting each tag to ~dl tags in the cohort which follows it. The removal of arcs and the testing of paths for validity as complete sentence interpretations are done using local constraints. A local constraint of length k on a given tag t is a rule allowing or disaUowing a sequence of k tags from being in its right (or left) neighborhood in any tag image of a sentence. In our approach, the local constraints are extractcd from the grammar (and this is the major aspect distinguishing it from some other short context methods such as [Beale 881, [DeRose 88], [Karlsson 90], [Katz 851, [Marcus 80], [Marshall 831, and [Milnc 861). For technical convenience we add the symbol \"$ <\" at the beginning of tag images and \"> $~ at the etad. Given a grammar G (wlfich for the time being we assume to be an unrestricted context-free phrase structure grammar), with a:set T of terminal symbols (tag set), a set V of variables (non-terminals, among which S is the root vailable for derivations), and a set P of production rules of the form A --. a, where A is in V and a is in (VUT)* , we define the Right Short Context of length k of a terminal t (tag): SCr (t,k) for t in T and for k = 0,1,2,3...","tz I z ~ T*, Izl=k or Izl < k if","\"> $' is the last tag in z, and there exists a derivation S = > atz// (a,//~ (V U T)* ) The l.eft Short Context of length k of a tag t relative to the grammar G is denoted by SCI (t,k) and defined in; a similar way. It is sometimes useful to define"]},{"title":"Positional","paragraphs":["Short Contexts. The definition is similar to the above, with a restriction that t may start only in a given position in a tag image of a sentence. The basis for the automaton Which checks a tag stream (path) for validity as a tag-image relative to the local constraints, is the function next(t), which for any t in T defines a set, as follows: : next (t) = { z I tz E SCr (t,l) } In [Ilerz/Rimon 911 we gave a procedure for computing next(t) from a given context free grammar, using standard practices of parsing of formal languages (see [Aho/Ulhnan 72]). 3. Local Constraints Automata We denote by LCA(I) the simple finite state automaton which uses the pre-processed {next(t)} sets to check if a given tag stream (path) satisfies the SCr(t,l) constraints. In a similar: manner it is possible to define LCA(k), relative to the short context of length k. We denote by L the language generated by the","3 Our studies of modern written ! lebrew suggest that about 60% of the word-forms in running texts are ambiguous with respect to a basic tag set, and the :average number of possible readings of such word-forms is 2.4. Even when counting only \"natural readings', i.e. interpretations which are likely to occur in typical corpora, this number is quite large, around 1.8 (it is somewhat larger for the small subset of the most common words). 156 - underlying grammar, and by L(k) the language accepted by the automaton LCA(k). The following relations hold for the family of automata (LCA(i)}: L(I) _~ L(2) _~ ... ~ L \"llfis guarantees a security feature: If for some i, I.CA(i) does not recognize (accept) a string of tags, then this string is sure to be illegM (i.e. not in 1.). On the other hand, any LCA(k) may recognize sentences not in L (or, from a dual point of view, will reject only part of the illegal tag images). The important question is how tight are the inclusion relations above - i.e. how well LCA(k) approximates the language I.. in particular we are interestcd in LCA(I). There is no simple analytic answer to tiffs question. Contradictory forces play here: the nature of the language -- c.g a rigid word order and constituent order yield stronger constraints; the grain of the tag set -- better refined tags (different languages may require different tag sets) help express refined syntactic claims, hence more specific constraints, but they \"also create a greater level of tagging ambiguity; the size of the grammar -- a larger grammar offers more information, but, covering a richer set of structures, it • allows more tag-pairs to co-occur; etc. It is interesting to note that for l lebrew, short context methods are most needed because of the considerable ambiguity at the lexical level, but their cll~:ctiveness suffers from the rather free word/constituent order. Finally, a comment about the computational efficiency of the LCA(k) automaton. The time complexity of checking a tag string of length n using I,CA(k) is at most O(n x k x loglTI), while a non-deterministic parser for a context free grmntnar may require O(n3x IGI2). (IT] is the size of the tag set, IGI is the size of the grammar). The space complexity of l,CA(k) is proportionM to ]7] k÷~ ; this is why otfly truly short contexts should be used. Note that for a sentence of length k, the power of LCA(k) is idcnticM to the weak generative capacity of the full underlying grammar. But since the size of sentences (tag sequences) in L is unbounded, there is no fixed k which suffices."]},{"title":"4. A Sample Grammar","paragraphs":["To illustrate claims made in the sections below, we will use the following toy grammar of a small fragment of English. Statements about the correctness of sentences etc., are of course relative to this toy grammar. The tag set T includes: n (noun), v (verb), det (determiner), adj ( adjective ) and prep (preposition). The context free grammar G is: S --> $< NP VP >$ NP--> (det) (adj) n NP --> NP PP PP --> prep NP VP --> v NP VP --> VP PP To extract the local constraints from this grammar, we first compute the function next(t) for every tag t in T, and from the resulting sets we obtain the graph below, showing valid pairs in the short context of length 1 (again, validity is relative to the given toy grammar): >$ This graph, or more conveniently the table of \"valid neighbors\" below, define the LCA(I) automaton. The table is actually the union of the SCr(t,l) sets for all t in T, and it is derived directly from the graph: $< det adj n prep adj $< adj v det prep n $< n v adj n prep det adj v n n v det n prep det n >$ - 157 -"]},{"title":"5. A \"Lucky Bag\" Experiment","paragraphs":["Consider the following sentence, which is in the language gcncratcd by grammar G of section 4: (1) Thc channing princess kissed a frog. The unique tag image corresponding to this sentence is: [ $ <, dot, adi, n, v, det, n, > $ ]. Now let us look at the 720 \"random inputs\" generated by permutations of the six words in (i), and the set of corresponding tag images. Applying I.CA(I), only two tag images are rccog~.ed as valid: [ $ <, det, adj, n, v, det, n, >$ ], and [ $<, dct, n, v, dot, adj, n, >$ ]. These are exactly the images corresponding to the eight syntactically correct sentences (relative to G), (la-b) The/a charming princess kissed a/the frog. (lc-d) The/a chamfing frog kissed a/the princess. (lc-t') The/a princess kissed a/the charming frog. (lg-h) The/a frog kissed a/the charming princess. This result is not surprising, given the simple scntence and toy grammar. (In general, a grammar with a small number of rules relative to the size of the tag set cannot produce too many valid short contexts). It is therefore interesting to examine another example, where each word is associated with a cohort of several interpretations. We borrow from [llcrz/Rimon 9.1]: (2) All old people like books about fish. Assuming the word tagging shown in section 6, there are 256 (2 x 2 x 2 x 4 x 2 x 2 x 2) tentative tag hnages (paths) for this sentence and for each of its 5040 permutations. This generates a very htrge number of rather random tag images. Applying LCA(I), only a small number of hnages are rccogtfizcd as potentially valid. Among them are syntactically correct sentences such as: (2a) Fish like old books about all people. ,and only less than 0.1% sentences which are locally valid but globally incorrect, such as: (2b) * Old tish all about books like people. (tagged as [$ <, n, v, n, prep, n, v, n, > $]). These two examples do not suggest any kind of proof, but they well illustrate the recognition power of even the least powerful automaton in the {LeA(i)} family.

Use of LeA in Conjunction with a Parser","paragraphs":["The number of potentially valid tag images (paths) for a given sentence can be exponential in the length of the sentence if all words are ambiguous. It is therefore desirable to filter out invalid tag images before (or during) parsing. To examine the power of LCAs as a pre-parsing fdter, we use example (2) again, demonstrating lexical ambiguities as shown in the chart below. The chart shows the Reduced Sentence Graph (RSG) - the original SG from which invalid arcs (relative to the SCr(t,l) table) were removed. ALL OLD PEOPLE LIKE BOOKS ABOUT FISH det--~adj--~n ~v - ~ n---~prep--->n n n ) v__prepj --e v >$ n We are left with four valid paths through the sentence, out of the 256 tentative paths in SG. Two paths represent legal syntactic interpretations (of which one is \"the intended\" meaning). The other two are locally valid but globally incorrect, having either two verbs or no verb at - 158 - all, in contrast to the grammar. SCr(t,2) would have rejected one of the wrong two. Note that in this particular example the method was quite effective in reducing sentence-wide interpretations (leaving an easy job even for a deterministic parser), but it was not very good in individual word tagging disambiguation. These two sub-goals of raging disambiguation reducing the number of paths and reducing word-level possibilities - are not identical. It is possible to construct sentences in which all words are two-way ambiguous and only two disjoint paths out of the 2 N possible paths are legal, thus preserving all word-level ambiguity. We demonstrated the potential of efficient path reduction for a pre-parsing filter. But short-context techniques can also be integrated into the parsing process itself. In this mode, when the parser hypothesizes the existence of a constituent, it will first check if local constraints do not rule out that hypothesis. In the example above, a more sophisticated method could have used the fact that our grammar does not allow verbs in constituents other than VP, or that it requires one and only one verb in the whole sentence. The motiwttion for this method, and its principles of operation, are similar to those behind different tecimiques combining top-down and bottom-up considerations. The performance gains depend on the parsing technique; in general, allowing early decisions regarding inconsistent tag assignments, based on information Which may be only implicit in the grammar, offers considerable savings."]},{"title":"7. Educated Guess of Unknown Words","paragraphs":["Another interesting aid Which local syntactic constraints can provide for practical parsers is \"an oracle\" which makes \"educated guesses ~ about unknown words. It is typical for language analysis systems to assume a noun whenever an unknown word is encountered. There is sense in tiffs strategy, but the use of LCA, even LCA(I), can do much better. To illustrate this feature, we go back to the princess and the frog. Suppose that an adjective unknown to the system, say 'q'ransylvanian\" was used rather than \"charming\" in example (1), yielding the input sentence: (3) The Transylvanian princess kissed a frog.
