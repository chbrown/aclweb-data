The strategies discussed have been implemented. 0. Introduction","Recent work in LFG uses the notion of projection to refer to linguistically relevant mappings or convspondences between levels, whether these mappings are direct or involve function composition (I-lalvorsen & Kaplan (1988), Kaplan (1987), Kaplan et al (1989)). Mapping functions such as V (from c to f structure) and o (from c to semantic structure) are familiar from the LFO literhture. Kaplan et al (1989) extend this approach to Machine Translation by defining two translation functions \"~ (between f-structures) and \"~' (between semantic structures). By means of these functions, one can 'co-describe' elements of source and target f-structures and s-structures respectively. Achieving translation can be thought of in terms of specifying and resolving a set of constraints on target structures, constraints which are expressed by means of the \"~ and \"c' functions.","The formalism permits a wide variety of sourco-target correspondences to be expressed: T and V can be composed, as can -c' and o. The approach allows for equations specifying translations to be added to lexical entries and (source language) c-structure rules. For example:"]},{"title":"(1) (~ (? SUB.0) = ((~ 1) SUBJ)","paragraphs":["composes \"~ and ap, equating the ~ of the SUBJ f-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the \"c of the mother's f-structure. Thus (1) says that the translation of the value of the SUBJ slot in a source f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the f-structure which is the translation of that source f-structure. What results is an interesting, and apparently extremely attractive approach to MT, which finds echoes in a good deal of recent work in MT and Computational Linguistics generally (van Noord et al (1990), Zajac (1990)). Among the apparent advantages are:","(i) that it avoids the problems that arise in traditional stratificational transfer systems where a variety of (often incompatible) kinds of information must be expressed in a single structure.","(ii) that, because it uses the formal apparatus of LFG, it is at least compatible with a large body of well worked out linguistic analyses.","Perhaps most important, however, the examples that Kaplan et al give suggest that the notation is both natural and expressive: natural, in the sense that adequate -c relations can be stated on the basis of reasonable intuitive and well-motivated linguistic analyses; expressive, in the sense that it is powerful enough to describe some difficult translation problems in a straightforward way.","In this paper we show that the notation is not as natural and expressive as it at first seems. We first show that the most natural analysis proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the range of data for the translational phenomenon in question. These eases are important because these constructions represent a pervasive structural difference between languages Which one wants to be able to deal with in a natural way. We then go on to discuss alternatives which depart from or extend the formalism - 293 - proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) in various respects, pointing out some directions for further research. Section 1","The discussion here concerns the translational data of head-switching or splitting/fusing discussed in Kaplan et al (1989) as cases of differences of embedding:","(2a) John just arrived.","Jean vient d'arriver.","(b) Jan zwemt graag/toevallig.","John likes to/happens to swim.","(c) I think that John just arrived.","Je pense que Jean vient d'arriver.","(d) Ik denk dat Jan graag zwemt.","I think that John likes to swim.","(e) Ich glaube dass Peter gem schwimmt.","I believe that Peter likes to swim.","Kaplan et al (1989) sketch two alternative approaches to head-switching. The first assumes that the adverb is essentially an f-structure head subeategorising for a sentential ARG. This has the effect of making the source and target f-structures rather similar to each other but faces a number of serious problems. Firstly, it violates the LFG assumption that the f-structure of the highest c-structure node contains the f-structures of all other nodes. Secondly, while such an analysis might well be correct for semantic structure, it cannot be justified on monolingual grounds as a surface syntactic feature structure (an f-structure). For example, it is the verb, not the adverb, which is the syntactic head of the construction, carrying tense and participating in agreement phenomena. This proposal therefore lacks monolingual motivation and thus is not attractive as an approach to translation. Thirdly, the approach cannot be extended to the case discussed here.","In this paper we focus on the alternative proposal, in which head-switching (or alternatively, splitting) is a x operation. 1 Adverbs \"are taken to be f-structure SADJs. The z annotation to ADVP states that the x of the mother f-structure is the XCOMP of the \"~ of the SADJ","I Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Kaplan el al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treating the adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simply means that the mapping problem we describe below arises in the monolinsual mapping between f-structure and s-structure. slot (Kaplan et al's fig. 26): 2"]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["S ~ NP ADVP VP (t SUB°3 = ~ (t SADJ)=~","(~ (t SADr) XCOMP) = (~ t) This has the effect of subordinating the translation of the f-structure which contains the SADJ to the translation of the SADJ itself.

This proposal raises a number of interesting questions for further research about whether functional uncertainty can be used here while still guaranteeing some determinate set of output structures to be validated (or not) by the target grammar. Notice however that for the case in hand, the uncertainty equation can be quite specific - all that is required is the source functional uncertainty: ('~ (f COMP SAD J)) = (('t t ) COMP) 3. Conclusion.","Our starting point in this paper was the observation that a treatment proposed for cases such as (2) in Kaplan et al (1989) is unworkable. We have then discussed alternative approaches available within the general model assumed by Kaplan et al (1989). We have shown that the problem is to achieve simple general statements of the correspondence mapping which cover exceptional eases without spreading the effect of exceptionality throughout the grammar. The discussion in section 2 raises intricate technical issues about the formalism itself, but also relates to wider issues concerning the modularity of the approach to translation proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) as well as the suitability and expressivity of the formalism, raising serious questions about the feasibility of a large MT system along these lines.","We also noted that these eases are unproblematic in the \"fusing\" direction, for then we do not run into problems with the functionality of the x correspondence.

For a given set of correspondences and a partially determined Set of structures, three possibilities exist: • no solution can be found; - 297 - • a finite number of solutions can be found;","• an indeterminate and/or infinite number of solutions can be found.","We might expect therefore that a solution may be found even if we state correspondences in the French -> English direction but supply the partial determination from the English side (that is, when English is source). The system for translating in either direction would then be a pair of monolingual grammars with a set of x equations stated in the \"fusing\" direction (i.e. in the French grammar). This is currently under investigation.","Preliminary results suggest that this approach will in fact cleanly overcome the specific problem at hand. It has proved possible to translate sentences (2b) and (2d) above from Dutch to English using grammars and lexicons in which ~ only appears in the English rules and entries. But this work has in turned raised a number of fundamental issues, some of which apply not only to LFG but to any other attempt at theory-based translation:","• Exactly what does the formal definition of the 'translates' relation look like, in LFG or any other theory-based approach to translation?","• Can this formal definition actually be implemented? Existing approaches to generation from f/s-structure in LFG are too restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and our current implementation over-compensates.","• Is the functional nature of correspondences appropriate to the z family, or would a relation be more appropriate? If so, what would the theoretical and practical consequences be?","• What is the relation between strict theory-based 'translation' and translation in the ordinary sense of the word? Is it not likely that its applicability will in practice be limited to closely related language pairs?","• Is there a substantive difference between the structures and - correspondences approach of LFG and the single - structured - sign approach of I-IPSG or UCG? Translation seems a strenuous test. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","We thank an anonymous EACL reviewer for helpful comments and constructive criti-Cisms, and Doug Arnold and Pete Whitelock for useful discussion.
