There appear to be two main reasons for this: the notations most commonly used can sometimes obscure the structure of proofs and fail to clearly convey linguistic structure, and the cMculus as it stands is apparently not powerful enough to describe many phenomena encountered in natural language.","In this paper we suggest ways of dealing with both these deficiencies. Firstly, we reformulate Lambek's system using proof figures based on the 'natural deduction' notation commonly used for derivations in logic, and discuss some of the related proof-theory. Natural deduction is generally regarded as the most economical and comprehensible system for working on proofs by hand, and we suggest that the same advantages hold for a similar presentation of categorial derivations. Secondly, we introduce devices called structural modalities, based on the structural rules found in logic, for the characterization of commutation, iteration and optionality. This permits the description of linguistic phenomena which Lambek's system does not capture with the desired sensitivity and gencrallty."]},{"title":"LAMBEK CATEGORIAL GRAMMAR","paragraphs":["PRELIMINARIES Categorial grammar is an approach to language description in which the combination of expressions is governed not by specific linguistic rules but by general logical inference mechanisms. The point of departure can be seen as Frege's position that there are certain 'complete expressions' which are the primary bearers of meaning, and that the meanings of 'incomplete expressions' (including words) are derivative, being","* We would like to thank Robin Cooper, Martin Picker-ing and Pete Whitelock for comments and discussion relat-ing to this work.

We s.uppese that linguistic objects have (at least) two components, form (syntactic) and meaning (semantic). We refer to sets of such objects as categories, which axe indexed by types, and stipulate that all complete expressions belong to categories indexed by primitive types. We then recursively classify incomplete expressions according to the meems by which they combine (syntactically and semantically) with other expressions.","In the 'syntactic calculus' of Lambek (1958) (variously known as Lambek categoriai grammar, Lambek calculus, or L), expressions are classified by means of a set of bidirectional types as defined in (1). (1) a. If X is a primitive type then X is a type.","b. If X and Y are types then X/Y and Y\\X","are types. X/Y (resp. Y\\X) is the type of incomplete expressions that syntactically combine with a following (resp. preceding) expression of type Y to form an expression of type X, and semantically are functions from meanings of type Y to meanings of type X.","Let us assume complete expressions to be sentences (indexed by the primitive type S), noun phrases (NP), common nouns (N), and non-finite verb phrases (VP).

The rule is said to discharge the assumption. The conclusion is said to depend on the undischarged assumptions, which are called the by. potheses of the proof.","A proof is usually represented as a tree: with the assumptions as leaves and the conclusion at:the root. Finding a proof is then seen as the task of filling this tree in, and the inference rules as operations on the partially completed tree. One can write the inference rules out as such operations, but as these are rather unwieldy it is more usual to present the rules in a more compact form as operations from a set of subproofs (the premises) to a conclusion, as follows (where m >_ I and n >_ 0): (3) . : [Y.l] d , [y.n] d .R' Z This states that a proof of Z can be obtained from proofs of X1 .... , Xm by discharging appropriate occurrences of assumptions Y, ..... I/,. The use of square brackets around an assumption indicates its discharge. R is the name of the rule, and the index i is included to disambiguate proofs, since there may be an uncertainty as to which rule has discharged which assumption.","As propositions are represented by formulas in logic, so linguistic categories are represented by type formulas in L. The left-to-right order of types indicates tim order in which the forms of subexpressions are to be concatenated to give a composite expression derived by the proof.

Hepple mad Morrill 1989).","We first define the notions of contraction and re.due. tion. A contraction schema R D C consists of a particular pattern R within proofs or terms (the redez) and an equal and simpler pattern C (the contractum).

Therefore the corresponding weak contraction preserves the semantic functional interpretation of the proof; in addition it preserves the syntactic string interpretation since the redex and contractum contain the same leaves in the same order. For example, the proof in (14) weakly contracts to theproof in (7), and correspondingly the term in (15) //-contracts to the term in (8). The results of these contractions cannot be further contracted and so ~re the respective results of reduction to weak normal form and//.normal form.","Weak contraction in L strictly decreases the size of proofs (e.g. the number of symbols in a contractum is always less than that in a redex), and//-contraction in. the single-bind lambda-calculus strictly decreases the size of terms. Thus there is strong normalization with respect to these reductions: every proof (term) reduces to a weak normal form (//-normal form) in a finite number of steps. This has as a corollary (normalization) that every proof (term) has a normad form, so that normal forms are fully representative: every proof (term) is equal to one in normal form. Since reductions preserve interpretations, an interpretation of a normal form will always be the - 200 - same as that of the original proof (term).

The higl,est of these is (the implicational fragment of) the logistic calculus LJ introduced in Gentzen (1936). Gentzen formulated this calculus ia terms of sequences of propositions, and then provided explicit structural rules to show the permitted ways to manipulate these sequences. The structural rules are permutation, which allows the order of the assumptions to be changed; contraction, which allows an assumption to be used more than once; and toeakening, which allows an assumption to be ignored. For a discussion of the logics generated by dropping some or all of these structural rules see e.g. van Benthem (1987).","Although freely applying structural rules 'are clearly not appropriate in categorial grammars for linguistic description, commutable, iterable and optional eleme,ts do occur in natural language.
