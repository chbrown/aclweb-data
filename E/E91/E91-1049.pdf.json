ABSTRACT This paper presents an experimental preference tool des!gned, implemented and tested m the Eurotra pro)ect. The mechanism is based on preference rules which can either compare subtrees pairwise or single out a subtree on the basis of some specified constraints. Scoring permits combining the effects of various preference rules. THE PROBLEM The aim of a translation system is to produce the correct translation of a given text. In Eurotra, where translation is split up into a series of mappings among intermediate levels of representation, provisional overgeneration is a necessary evil [Raw et al. 1989]: the closer to surface structure a level of representation is, the harder it becomes for the parser to produce an unambiguous result. In the Eurotra framework, the E-framework [Bech et al. 1989], overgeneration can be partially controlled by filters which describe parse trees that are to be discarded as not obeying some specified constraints. Thus, filters apply to individual objects and are meant to delete inherently wrong representations. But there are cases where the grammar produces multiple analyses of a given input because the input is ambiguous with respect to a given level. All of these analyses are in some sense correct, although further processing might discard some of them. Our aim was to design a preference mechanism able to choose the best among a set of acceptable candidates. OUR VIEW OF PREFERENCE Preference has been defined in a number of ways, e.g. as a gradual fulfilment of semantic constraints [Fass andWilks 1983], as a lexically induced syn~ctic bias [Ford et al. 1982], as a parsm[[ strategy in~- pendent of linguistic criteria [Frazler and Fodor 1978, Pereira 1985], and as a system based on multiple judgements reflecting the complexity of psychological processes [Jackendoff 1985]. Our approach, which is greatly indebted to Jackendoffs theory of preference rule systems, is based on the following assumptions:","- Preference is a method which, on the basis of some preference criteria, chooses the best one among a set of possible interpretations which are all correct according to the grammar.","- Each preference criterion is expressed as a set of statements, where a statement is either a binary relation between competing interpretations or the description of a subtree which satisfies some defined criteria.","- There is no unique preference criterion according to which the best interpretation can be chosen: preference criteria are multiple, and possibly contradictory. A preference mechanism must be able to accommodate such multi- ~eCferYence criteria are heuristic principles which may vary according to the language and the text type: therefore, they are not hardwired m the system.","In the previous Eurotra preference mechanism [Petitpierre et al. 1987], preference statements were only defined as binary relations between subtrees. Since comparing subtrees is a rather expensive operation from the computational point of view, and since a number of preference cnteria - e.g. the principle of right-low attachment - cannot be expressed in binary terms, we have allowed both binary and non-binary preference rules. The applicaaon algorithm of p-rules and the way in which various preference criteria are combined are also new w~th respect to the previous system. THE MECHANISM PROPOSED","The mechanism proposed is an independent module which is activated on the results output by the parser. The module consists of pre~r.ence rules of two possible kinds, which we call tnnary and unary rules.","A binary rule establishes a preference relation between two correspondin~ (sub)trees (from here on, (sub)tree will be used m the sense of a representation of an interpretation or a part ot m~s representation). A unary rule picks up a (sub)tree on the basis of i~s own properties, thus implicitly establishing a preference relation between this (sub)tree and all its competitors. Each preference rule - be it binary or unary - is associated with a score, which is assigned to the preferred (sub)tree as a result of the application of the rule. - 281 - Correspondences: The notion of correspondence between (sub)trees is central topreference rules of the binary type. A number of def'mitions of this concept can be envisaged:","i. The correspondence between two (sub)trees is established by the user, who states that some specified contraints hold between parts of them.","ii. A correspondence is only assumed to exist between full parse trees, and the correspondence between two subtrees is defined by specifying their derivation paths from the top node.","iii. The system proauces a parse graph which will be a synthesis of the various parse trees, where parts common to several trees are shared; two subtrees correspond if they share a given part. The most challenging solution is (iii): we have not adopted it because of computational problems connected with the introduction of structure-sharing into .the E-framework. The easiest solution to implement","(ii): this is the approach chosen in the earlier urotra preterence tool. The solution we have adopted ts (i), which unlike (ii) allows the user to state constraints on subtrees, regardless of their position in the complete parse tree. In other words, our system allows for very local and modular statements. Preference Rules: The user expresses preference statements through a set of binary or unary preference rules (p-rules). The syntax for a binary rule is","RuleName ( Score ) = LHS >= RHS where","Annotations.","where: RuleName is a unique identifier used for trace purposes; Score is a positive integer which indicates how strong the relation of preference is; LHS and RHS (the left-hand side and the righthand side of the rule) are the descriptions of the two (sub)trees to be compared;","- >= is a preference sign that indicates which of the two (sub)trees is to ~e preferred; An.notations is a (possibly empty) set of constraints wmcn must hold between the constituents of the two (sub)trees to be compared. The syntax for a unary rule is","RuleName ( Score ) = LHS where","Annotations. where: - LHS is the description of the (sub)tree to be","singled out (which we call the left-hand side to","stress the parallelism with binary rules); - the other parts are as defined for binary rules. LttS and RHS are (sub)tree descriptions of any de.l~h and relevant parts of them may be labelled wtm r'rotog variables, called indexes. These labels are used to express simple or complex correspondence constraints in the annotation part of the rule. A simple constraint states for instance that two indexed subtrees must or must not have the same structure. Simple constraints may be combined with the operators 'and\" and 'or' to form complex constraints. Scores, which have the function of driving p-rule interaction, are positive integers. They may be either assigned by the user or generated automaucally on statistical grounds, as explained below. Examples of both rule types are given in the appendix.","General Algorithm: All theparse trees have an initial null score before preference rules are applied. For each pair of trees, if they contain two subtrees respectively matching the LHS and the RHS of a binary p-rule, while the constraints in the annotation part of the rule hold, the rule applies. Similarly, for each parse tree, if a subtree matching the LHS of a unary b-rule can be extracted, and all the constraints expressed in the rule are satisfied, the rule applies. In both eases, as a result of p-rule applicatton, the score of the object that contains the preferred subtree is incremented by the score of the rule.","When all binary rules have been tried out on all the possible pairs of trees in all the possible ways, and all unary rules have been fired on all the single trees, results are collected. All parse trees are partitioned into equivalence classes according to their score. Note that trees to which no preference rule has applied will belong to the lowest-ranking class: this is motivated by the assumption that unary rules prefer single trees over all the other members of the set of compeling trees.","After this partial order has been established, all the trees but those belonging to the highestranking class are discarded.","A possible enhancement to the expressive power of p-rules would be the introduction of negative scores, for cases where a p-rule describes an acceptable but not totally correct subtree. AN EXAMPLE","The following set of p-rules are based on some of the criteria for the treatment of PP attachment described in [Hirst 1987]. Note that p-rule scores have been assigned manually, due to the small number of rules.","pmod (8) = {cat=pp, sf-=mod} [PI: {cat=p}, NPI: {cat=np}]",">= {cat=pp, sf=mod} [P2:{cat,---p}, NP2: {cat=np}] where PI=P2, NPI=NP2.","In the rule above, 0 delimit a node in the tree, which in the E-framework is a set of attribute value pairs, [] following a given node enclose its daughters, = means equal to and ~= means different from. The rule prefers a valency-bound PP to a PP modifier. This is a very strong criterion, which can only be overridden by semantic principles: therefore, the rule has a high score. - 282 - plow (2)= {cat=nptt,[__, {cat=n], ## {cat=pp],"]},{"title":"*{} ].","paragraphs":["The rule gives 2 points to an attachment where a PP is placed under an NP node. Note that *0 means any number of (sub)trees, without any restriction, and ~ in front of a subtree means that this subtree is weakly dominated by the top node. Assuming the following two structures a) NP I","N NP pp b) NP I","N NP","I N pp 'plow' will only apply once to (a), but it would fire twice on (b), which will in the end collect the highest score.

The rule above assigns 5 points to a coordinated structure where the two conjuncts have the same number of terminals. Note that constraints are stated between nodes of two com~ting (sub)trees and not, as it was the case in pmod', between nodes belonging to the same (sub)tree.

Thus, note that for all the PPs in sentence (1), the system has been able to find valency-bound syntactic functions (either subject or prepositional objec0.","pobj/pmod","PP i","p comp~","om np/plow","I","n Dobj mod","losning pp/ImllOd ap","I i p compT adj af np effektiv","I","n","problem - 283 - Obj2:","V deltage O~3:","V kontrollere 8 I","subj np I n","virksomhed","pobj PP","eompl np/plow I","n handlingsprogram P for mod PP I compl cardp","t card 1990 8 I subj np I","Konuniaaionen conjunct","np/plow","I obJlp~oo~'d np I conjunct np/plow .","n finansiering pp n p~bj/pm~d samarbeJde / \\ / \\ af virksomheder PP / \\ / \\ med industri Consequently, modifier interpretations have been dispreferred. In the case of sentence (2) instead, the final PP has been analysed as a modifier, and the correct attachment has been found by the principle of right-low attachment. Note also that, still in (2), the verb \"deltage\" requires an obligatory prepositional object, and therefore this syntactic function has not been established by preference. Finally, in (3) the correct attachment of the two PPs has been found due to the combined effect of all three rules. SCORING Scoring is an important novelty proposed in our","Stem to replace the rule ordering strategy in use in","previous Eurotra preference tool. Whereas arbitrary decisions were made in the earlier tool in cases of contradictory preference criteria and mul.tiple matches between a rule and two (sub)trees, scoring permits us to control the interaction of preference rules in a declarative way. However, there is a Iradeoff between the declarativeness permitted by a scoring system and the difficulty of finding the right sco~es for a p-rule set of nontrivial coverage. In this section we show how optimum p-rule scores can be derived automatically. Starting from a set of p-rules and an initial set of objects ordered by the user, the system tries to compute optimum values for the p-rules in the set, on the assumption that they will hold for different sets of objects. If Pi (i=l,...n) stands for the score of the i-th p-rule, then the j-th object is assigned a score Sj given by the following expression: (1) Sj = Plalj + p2a~ + ... + p,a~ (j=I,...N) where n is the number of existing p-rules, aij is a constant equal to the number of times p-rule i has applied to object j and N is the number of exmting objects. In other words, Sj stands for the final score totalled by a given object after all possible p-rules have applied to it as many times as possible.","To compute optimum scores, an. arbi .W.ary high score is assigned to the best object(s) m me initial training corpus and a much lower one m the rest. The set of equations (1) is transtormea then into an overdetermined system of N equations with n unknowns - the p-rule scores - where N can be greater than n. The set of equations (1) can be further decomposed and reformulatea as follows: Find x~ (i--1,...n÷l) such that, (2) xtav + x2a2, + ... + XnSnj \" Xn+lSj = 0 ,","By comparing the set of equations (2) against the set (1), the following relation between me values of x i and p-rule scores is deduced: (3) Pi = x/xt~l)","Therefore, we claim that problems (1) and (2) are equivalent. Now, problem (.2) hasno exact solution whenever N is greater man n. rtowever, it can be solved by converting it into a constraint optimization problem whereby optimum scores for p-rules will emerge. Thus the set of equations (2) is rearranged by introducing, the erro~ ej (i=l,...N) and by imposing mat me sum ol ml these errors is minimum. More precisely problem (2) takes now the following form: Find x~ (i=l,...n+l) such that ca2 + e= + ... +em ---> minimum - 284 - subject to the constraints (4) e i = xtali + x~%j + ... + x.~ - x~÷iS i (j=I,...N) xt2 + x, +... x(,, m = 1 In the literature (cf. [Key & Marple 1981] and [Kunmr~an & Tufts 1982]), one of the most efficient techniques offered to the solution of the constraint optimization problem (4) is called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD provides an optimum set of x~ (i=l,...n+l) which guarantees minimum accumulated squared error. Thus the values of the scores p~ (i=l,...n) are computed in a straightforward way from the x~ (i=l,...n+l) using equation (3). Note that SVD is a non-linear optimization technique which provides the best set of parameters for a given training corpus. Therefore, it is \" portant to apply it to a linguistically balanced corpus. More-over, for the produced result to be reliable, the existing number of equations N should be at least five to ten times bigger than the existing number of p-rules n. Although SVD provides an optimum set of p-rule scores, there is no guarantee that these scores are all positive. However, since p-rules express positive selection criteria, p-rnle scores must always be positive: the following paragraph proposes an lterative algorithm which computes p-rule scores guaranteeing their positiveness at the same time. The idea is that the set of SVD parameters xl (i=l,...n+l) and the N sets of parameters in the training corpus are uncorrelated sets, i.e. they do not belong to the same space section. If the SVD solution set x~ (i=l,...n+l) is also included in the training set, the new SVD solution yi (i=l,...n+l) of the augmented training corpus willbe tmcorrelated to all the sets in the corpus. Consequently, Yi (i=l,...n+l) will also be uncorrelated to x L (i=l,...n+l). This means that not all the signs ofyi (i=l,...n+l) will be identical to the signs of x~ (i=l,...n+l). If the y components are all positive or all negative, the algorithm ends successfully and positive p-rule scores are computed via equation (3). In all other cases, the set of y~ (i=l,...n+l) is also incorporated in the training corpus and a new SVD solution z~ (i=l,...n+l) is computed which is uncorrelated to both x~ and Yi (i=l,...n+l). The algorithm continues in a similar way by checking whether the signs of z~ (i=l,...n+l) are all the same or not: in the first case the algorithm ends successfully; in the second case the set of z~ (i=l,...n+l) is included in the corpus and a new SVD solution is computed. The algorithm will eventually come up with the desirable set of parameters when all alternatives have been exhausted throughout the precedin~ iterations. The time of convergence varies relattve to the number of parameters or, equivalently, to the number of p-rules, as well as the size of the training corpus. More precisely, the larger the number of p-rules, the longer it takes for the algorithm to converge, on the other hand, the larger the training corpus, the faster the time of convergence. The obtained solution is optimum given .the maposed constraint thai all p-rule scores are posinve. CONCLUSION","It seems to us that two basic tendencies can be observed in the literature with respect to the treatment of preference. On the one hand, preference is conceived of as an essentially lingutstic or psycholinguistic principle or sum of principles (of. the LFG approach m [Ford et at. 1982]); although it has important consequences for the parser, preference ts not directly connected to a specific parsing method, on the other nano, preference has been studied in the context of parsing: in such Ireatments (el. [Pereira 1985]), preference amounts to a deterministic procedure, which is not necessarily motivated by linguistic evidence. In our approach preference is established on the basis of rules defined by the user and applied by a post-processor. We have in fact focussed on a method to express linguistically meaningful, preference statements rather than on a particular parsing strategy. . we are aware of the fact that, in a system where parsing is seen as a constraint satisfaction problem, preference criteria of the type we are interested in can be treated on the same level as other linguistic constraints and used to resolve ambiguity at parse time (of. [Van Henteryck 1989]). However, such an approach would have meant too radical a change to the underlying Eurotra formalism.","In accordance with the general practice in Eurotra, our preference mechanism does not plead allegiance to any specific linguistic theory. We have, however, been influenced by a theoretical framework, namely the theory of preference rule systems described in [Jackendoff 1985]. According to this framework, preference can only been decided on the basis of a number of criteria, and a preference mechanism is not based on a dichotomy between correct and wrong results, but on a scale of degrees of acceptability. One of_our main concerns m designing the system, in tact, has been allowing various and even contradictory criteria to be combined in a declarative fashion. The use of scoring is in this sense crucial.","The system has been implemented and successfully tested on real input which showed overgeneration due to PP and adverbial attachment, coordination, pronominal resolution and lexical ambiguity. Some testing results are given in the appendix.
