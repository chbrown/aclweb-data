In this paper, we will explore the adequacy of the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism for dealing with long-distance scrambling I in German. We will show that TAGs cannot capture the full range of constructions derived by scrambling. I[owever, Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAG), an extension of TAGs introduced earlier [Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988] and utilized for linguistic purposes (e.g. for extraposition [Kroch and Joshi 1986]), can indeed capture the full range of constructions derived by scrambling. We will also present an ID/LP variant of TAG to capture the same constructions, and then comment on the relationship between the two systems."]},{"title":"2 Some Linguistic Data","paragraphs":["A striking feature of scrambling is its freedom: there appear to be no systematic syntactic restrictions on the number of verbal arguments that undergo \"movement,\" nor on the distances over which they may move 3. Thus, any ordering of the arguments from all clauses is possible. To illustrate this freedom we will present two additional examples in which scrambling of a more complex nature occurs. 1. More than one constituent may undergo movement into higher clauses. The scrambled constituents need not retain their original relative order to each other after scrambling. In sentence (2b), two NPs are scrambled out of the embedded clause into the top-level clause. 2. Constituents may be moved over an unbounded number of clauses. In sentence (3b), NP die Witwen has been moved into its immediately dominating clause, while NP der Opfer has been moved from the most deeply embedded clause into the top-level clause, beyond the intermediate clause. In German (and in many other SOV languages, such as Korean, Ilindi and Japanese), a constituent of an embedded clause may be moved from that clause into the matrix clause. Consider, for example, sentences (1) in Figure 1. In German, the object of the embedded clause can be \"moved \"2 to any position in the matrix clause, as in sentences (lb) and (lc).","\"This work was partially supported by NSF grants DCR-84-10413, ARO grant DAAL03-89-O031, and DARPA-ONR grant N0014-85-K0018.

This extended domain of locality, provided by the elementary trees of TAG, allows us to \"lexicalize\" a TAG grammar: we can associate each tree in a grammar with a lexical item [Schabes et al 1988, Schabes 1990] 4. The tree will contain the lexical item, and all of its syntac-","3Some verbs allow scrambling out of their Complements more freely than others. It appears that all subject-control verbs and most object-control verbs governing the dative allow scrambling fairly f~ely, while scrambling with object-control verbs governing the accusative is more restricted (cir.

As has been shown previously, certain long-distance phenomena such as topicalization and wh-movement can be handled naturally within TAG [Kroch and Joshi 1985]. Ilere, \"naturally\" means that dependencies are stated within the larger domain of locality (the elementary tree), i.e., each clausal tree still contains a verb and all of its arguments. Thus, in a lexicalized TAG, the effects of long-distance movement are achieved by adjunction. The word order freedom possible in the context of unconstrained scrambling, however, eludes the scope of TAGs. In this section, we will informally argue this formal result. By an argument very similar to Shieber's argument for Swiss German [Shieber 1985], it can b'e shown that the string language of scrambled High German is not a context-free language. However, the linguistic facts of German do not allow an extension of the argument: we cannot show that the string language is not a Tree Adjoining Language.

We are really only interested in linguistically motivated grammars, namely those that exploit the extended domain of locality and whose trees obey tile constraint of containing a lexical item and all of its syntactic dependents (and nothing else). We will refer to such restrictions as \"co-occurrence constraints\". We can show that no TAG meeting the co-occurrence constraints can generate the sentences of German scrambling. We will argue this point in two complementary ways. First, we will consider the ease of clauses with two overt nominal arguments. Then, we will consider the case of clauses with one overt nominal argument. In the first case, the verb of the embedded clause subcategorizes for three NPs, one of which is an empty subject (PRO). There is no verb in German that subcategorizes for three NPs and an S, so in this case a recursively embedded structure is impossible, and we have only one level of embedding.

In the case of the embedded two-argument clauses, examples are readily available, as in sentences (2a) and (2b). In the case of the embedded one-argument sentences, it is more difficult (but not impossible) to construct an adequate example because of the great depth of embedding. However, one might argue that there is a limit on the number of clauses over which a scrambled NP may move. If this were true, the number of resulting structures would be finite, so that they could be handled trivially by simple formalisms. Sentences (3a) and (3b) show scrambled NPs can move over two clauses, and we know of no evidence that convincingly establishes such a limit for higher numbers. The reluctance that some native speakers show to accept the more complex sentences is due mainly to processing difficulties, rather than to tim ungrammaticality of the sentences. A similar phenomenon occurs when native speakers reject multiply center-embedded sentences as \"ungrammatical\". In summary, long-distance scrambling provides linguistic evidence that shows that scrambling is beyond the formal generative capacity of TAGs. In the next two sections, we will investigate two ways of extending the TAG formalism in order to achieve the necessary power. In the first approach, we will relax the immediate dominance relation of the elementary trees. In the second approach, we will relax the linear precedence relations of the elementary trees. In both cases, our concern will be to preserve the key properties of 'FAGs, namely their extended domain of locality, and the factoring of recurs,on from dependencies."]},{"title":"4 A Multi-Component TAG (MC-TAG) Approach: Relaxed ID","paragraphs":["One approach is to relax the ID (Immediate Dominance) relation within one elementary tree.

It is not possible to adjoin trees from the same set into each other. Thus, we can interpret TAGs with relaxed dominance as MC-TAGs, by identifying subtrees containing only ID relations with trees in an MC-TAG tree set.

With the restricted definition of adjunction (called \"local MC-TAG\"), MC-TAG has been shown to have a slightly greater generative power than TAG; however, local MC-TAGs still be-long to the class of Mildly Context Sensitive Grammar formalisms (MCSG). Weir [Weir 1988] has also shown that MC-TAGs are equivalent to the Linear Context Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), which are the best known characterization of the MCSG formalism (though they are not an exhaustive characterization of MCSG). In particular, we know that local MC-TAGs are polynomially parsabie. However, it can be shown that local MC-TAGs are not adequate for deriving all possible scrambled sentences in German (for a detailed discussion, see [Becker and Rainbow 1990]). In fact, no LCFILS is powerful enough to capture scrambling. It is obvious that MC-TAG with the more liberal definition of adjunction (called \"nonlocal MC-TAG\") can produce all the possible versions of scrambled embedded sentences for any level of embedding. However, nonlocal MC-TAG has not yet been studied in detail, and it is currently not known whether nonlocal MC-TAGs are polynomially parsable.","7This particular example can be derived with a weaker for-msdism; the point of tile examp..ie is merely to illustrate the proposed formalism.

As does an LD/LP-TAG grammar, a FO-TAG grammar consists of a set of elementary structures. Each elementary structure is a pair consisting of one linear dominance (LD) structure (i.e., an unordered tree) and corresponding LP rules. The LD structure (which will, imprecisely, be referred to as a \"tree\" in this paper) is either an initial or an auxiliary structure. The LP rules may relate any two nodes of the tree unless one linearly dominates the other, ttowever, these precedence rules can only be stated with respect to the nodes of an elementary tree; it is impossible to relate nodes in different trees. When an auxiliary tree fl is adjoined into an initial tree et, the nodes of fl are not ordered with respect to the nodes of a. However, even in languages with relatively free word order there are restrictions on movement. In order to capture these, we introduce two linguistically motivated constraints, the integrity constraint and the inheritance constraint. The integrity constraint, written A, allows us to express the fact that German does not allow scrambling into or out of certain constituents, such as NPs and CPs (tensed clauses). If we have AX for some node X, then any node which is not in the subtree rooted at X and which does not dominate X must either precede or follow every node in the subtree rooted in X. The inheritance constraint, written $, forces inheritance and allows us to capture the clause-final position of the verb in German. If we have $X for a node X, then when the tree of which X is a node is adjoined into another tree at node A, X inherits all LP rules specified for A. As an example, consider sentences (2a) and (2b) given in Section 2. The initial trees along with the LP rules and constraints are shown in Figure 5. Adjunction yields the structure shown in Figure 6. Note that only one of the possible orderings of the nodes, corresponding to sentence (2b), is shown.

We are currently investigating these issues. From a linguistic point of view, it is interesting that the same linguistic phenomenon can be handled by two very different formalisms. Scrambling is currently attracting much attention from syntacticians working in the GB framework. One question as yet unresolved is whether clause-internal scrambling is the same type of syntactic movement as long-distance scrambling. In FO-TAG, both types of movement are created by the same formal device, namely the underspecification of LP rules. In the case of MC-TAG, only long-distance scrambling can be simulated by multicomponent adjunction; clause-internal scrambling must be handled by some other means (such as metarules, which func-tion as an abbreviatory device for listing a finite set of elementary trees), since it is impossible to adjoin one tree into another tree of the same tree set.

In particular, the verb and its arguments are no longer contained within the same domain of locality, a key requirement of the TAG formalism. Their approach is essentially motivated by linguistic considerations; however, it is easy to show that their analysis can be expressed in our proposed variant of MC-TAG, thus supporting our purely formal analysis, and also showing that the locality of TAGs can be preserved. The proposed FO-TAG formalism is close in spirit to GPSG, in that ID and LP relations are stated separately.

We have proposed two more powerful extensions of TAG: a variant of the well-studied MC-TAG, and a TAG formalism with free node order, FO-TAG. We have shown that both are descriptively adequate. The linguistic descriptions that these formalisms give rise to, however, are quite different, and they make different predictions about the nature of long-distance scrambling. Some key formal properties of the two formalisms are still under investigation, in particular the issues of polynomial parsability and generative power. We conjecture that FO-TAG and MC-TAG with dominance links (or some slight definitional variants of the two systems) are weakly equivalent to each other."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Bayer and Kornfllt 1989] Bayer, Josef and Kornfilt, Jaklin, 1989.
