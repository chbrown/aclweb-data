A system is portable in the sense intended here, if it is not geared to a single subject domain, but can be ported with a reasonable effort to a vailely of subjccl domains. It is common understanding that there cxisls a t:t:llhal [i'aglnt'.tlt of a language which I. is required for dealing with virtually any subject d(~main, anti 2. is invariant with respect to meaning and use accross subject donmins, it is of course a non-trivial empirical question whether such a cen{ral fragment really exists, and if so, to say what it is, but a number of researchers scenl tO share the asstllnption that it does (ef. e.g. Alshawi ct al. (19R8)). Any robust and portablc system would then have to handle this core fi'agmcnl.","in this paper I am concerned with a second - related - assumption, namely that there exists a core vocabulary which is needed for handling any subject domain. 'llfis assumpti(m is also shared by many researchers, and it tmdcrlies the production of basic vocabularies for language learning such as Ochlcr (1980). l.Jsually the attthors claim that their word lists are I)ased on statistical investigations, but they also emphasize that. they did not slavishly stick to the statistics but used additional crilcria such as \"usage value\", \"availability\", \"familiarity\", or \"lcamability\" without ever saying how these are eslablished.2 I will address the following questions:","I. llow can the intuilivc notion of core vocabulary be properly dciincd?","2. llow can statistical methods be employed to define a core vocabtdaD, and how do they relate to semantic criteria?","3. What semantic criteria can be found to define a core vocabulary?"]},{"title":"Definitions of a core vocabulary","paragraphs":["\"l:here are several ways to define core vocab,lary, I can think of the following three:","1. The core vocabulary consists of the n most frequent words of a hmguage.","2. The core w~cabulary is that vocabulary which is common to all nativc speakers of a language.","3. The sema,tic core vocabulary consists of lhose words which suffice to dcfinc all of the remaining vocabuh~ry of a language.","The first two definitions call Re\" statistical methods which shall be discussed in the next gcction, and the third onc obviously requires a .~cmanlic approach which shall bc discusscd in ~cclion \"Soma,tic crilcria\"."]},{"title":"Statistical methods","paragraphs":["l:rcqucncy counts have well established the basic propcrtics of the frequency distribution for text corpora.

Since specific subject matters and communicative functions vary in importance for different speakers of a language, it will be difficult if not inapossible to eliminate arbitrariness.
