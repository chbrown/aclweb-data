In this paper, we illustrate what the lexical semantics of reporting verbs must incorporate in order to contribute to the reconstruction of story and context. The lexical structures proposed are derived from the analysis of semantic collocations over large text corpora."]},{"title":"I Motivation","paragraphs":["We can distinguish two levels in newspaper articles: the pure information, here called primary informalion, and the meta-informati0n , which embeds the primary information within a perspective, a belief context, or a modality, which we call circumstan.- tim information. The distinction is not limited to, but is best illustrated by, reported speech sentences. Here the matrix clause or reporting clause corresponds to the circumstantial:information, while the complement (whether realized as a full clause or as a noun phrase) corresponds t'o primary information. For tasks such as knowledge extraction it is the primary information that is of interest. For example in the text of Figure 1 the matrix clauses (italicized) give the circumstantial information of the who, when and how of the reporting event, while what is reported (the primary information) is givel~ in tile complements.","The particular reporting verb also adds important information about the manner of the original utterance, the preciseness of tile quote, the temporal rela-I, iolJship between ,uatrix clause and e(mq~h:me,l,, aml more. In addition, the source of tile original information provides information about the reliability or credibility of the primary information. Because the individual reporting verbs differ slightly but importantly in this respect, it is the lexicai semantics that must account for such knowledge.","US Advising Third Parties on","Hostages","(R1) The Bush administration continued to insist ~esterday that (CI) it is not involved in negotiations over the Western hostages in Lebanon, (R2) but acknowledged that (C2) US olliciais have provided advice to and have been kept informed by \"people at all levels\" who are holding such talks.","(C3) \"There's a lot happening, and I don't want to be discouraging,\" (R3) Marlin Fitzwalet, the president's spokesman, told reporters.

The most unmarked reporting verb is say. The only presupposition for say is that there was an original utterance, the assumption being that this utterance is represented as closely as possible. In this sense say is even less marked than re. porl, which in addition specifies an a(Iressee (usually implicit from the context.)","The other members in the semantic fieM are set apart through their semantic collocations. Let us consider in depth the case of insist.

In a careful analysis of a 250,000 word text base of TIME magazine articles from 1963 (TIMEcorpus) [Berglerg0a] we confirmed that in every sentence containing insist some kind of opposition could be recovered and was supported by some other means (such as emphasis through word order etc.). Tire most common form of expressing the opposition was through negation, as in (1) above.","In an automatic analysis of the 7 million word corpus containing Wall Street Journal documents (WSJC) [Berglerg0b], we found the distribution of patterns of opposition reported in Figure 2. This analysis shows that of 586 occurrences of insist throughout tim VVSJC, 10O were instances of the idiom insisted on which does not subcategorize for a clausal complement.

They argue for a flexible lexicon design that can accomodate both single word eutries and collocational patterns of different strength and rigidity. But the collocations considered in their proposal are all based on word cooccurrences, not taking advantage of the even richer layer of semantic collocations made use of in this proposal. Semantic collocations are harder to extract than cooccurrence patterns--the state of the art does not enable us to find semantic collocations automatically t. This paper however argues that if we take advantage of lexicai paradigmatic behavior underlying the lexicon, we can at least achieve semi-automatic extraction of semantic collocations (see also Calzolari and Bindi (1990)","I But note the important work by Hindle [HindlegO] on extracting semantically similar nouns based on their substitutability in certain verb contexts.
