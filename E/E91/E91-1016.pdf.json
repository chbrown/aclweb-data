This approach breaks down for languages where the phonological shape of a morpheme can be heavily dependent on the phonological shape of another, as is the case in Arabic. In this paper we show how the tense logical approach investigated by Blackburn (1989) can be used to encode hierarchical and temporal phonological information of the kind explored by Bird (1990). Then we show how some Arabic morphemes may be represented and combined t . INTRODUCTION","There is an increasingly widespread view that linguistic behaviour results from the complex interaction of multiple sources of partial information. This is exemplified by the rapidly growing body of work on natural language syntax and semantics such as the Unification-Based Grammar Formalisms. Similarly, in phonology there is a popular view of phonological representations as having the same topology as a spiral-bound notebook, where segments (or slots) axe strung out along the spine and each page gives a structural description of that suing according to some descriptive vocabulary. Crucially only those segmental strings which are licensed by all of the independent descriptions are acceptable.","The practical difficulty is tO come up with a model of grammatical organization which allows the right information to be brought to bear at the right stage. One model which looks particularly attractive in this regard considers the traditional modules of grammar (i.e. syntax, semantics and phonology) not in series where the output of one feeds into the input of the next, but rather in parallel, where each module exerts independent constraints. For example, a morpheme may be represented as a complex consisting of a semantic expression, a constraint on (morpho)syntactic distribution, and a phonological description. The combination of morphemes is then subject to three independent calculi, one per domain. The result is a compositional account of the relationship between form and meaning, as evidenced in the work of Bach (1983), Hoeksema & Janda (1988) and Wheeler (1988). However, all these proposals have as-sumed that phonological representations are merely linear","I We are indebted to Mike Reape, Ewan Klein and members of the Edinburgh Applied Logic group for discussions of the material presented here. We are grateful for the support of ESPRIT Basic Research Action 3175 (DYANA) and SERC post-doctoral fellowship B/ITF/255. sequences of segments. Such a restriction renders a theory incapable of expressing the observations which have been made in the non-linear phonology literature (e.g. Goldsmith 1990). Bird & Klein (1990) and Bird (1990) have endeavoured m show how the compositional approach can be liberated from a purely linear segmental view of phonology. This paper exemplifies and extends those proposals.","The first section presents a logical language for phonological description. The second section shows how it has sufficient expressive power to encompass a variety of observations about syllable structure. The final section discusses further observations which can be made about Arabic syllable structure, and provides an illustrative treatment of so-called non-concatenative morphology in the perfect tense 'verb paradigm. LOGICAL FRAMEWORK","Interval based tense logics are calculi of temporal reasoning in which propositions are assigned truth values over extended periods of time s. Three operators F (future), P (past) and O (overlaps) are introduced: F~b means \"q~ will be the case (at least once)\", P~b means \"~b was the case (at least once)\" and O~b means \"~b is the case at some overlapping interval (at least once)\". O corresponds to what phonologists call 'association'. Typically sentences are true at some intervals and not at others. (This is obviously the case, for example, if ~b encodes the proposition \"the sun is shining\".) Blackburn (1989) has explored the effects of adding of a new type of symbol, called nominals, to tense logic. Unlike ordinary propositions, nominals are only ever true once. In a sense, a nominal is a 'name' (or a 'temporal indexical') for that unique period of time at which it is true. Certain observations about time can only be expressed in a theory which employs nominals. For example, i ~ -~Fi picks out precisely the irreflexive time flows, whereas no formula containing only propositional variables can do this. Nominals have been employed in the analysis of temporal reference in linguistic semantics. The present paper illustrates an application of nominals to a very different domain, namely phonology. In addition to F, P and O, we shall employ the modality O to represent phonological dominance a.","2 See van Benthem 1983 for an introduction to this field and a survey of a variety of possible formulations of temporal structure.","3 The notion of dominance as eanployed in phonology corresponds closely to the use of the term in feature logics. However. we treat dominance as a relation rather than as a collection of partial functions, for two reasons. First. in phonological structures, it is the nodes and not the arcs which are labelled. Second, there can be multiple arcs emanating from a node. - 89 - Syntax. Let X = {p, q, r,...} be the propositional variables and let N = {i, j, k,...} be the nominals of L. Then L is the smallest set such that all of the following hold, where ¢, ~P E L. T,_k E L X,N C L <>~b,F¢,P¢,O¢ E L ~b v ¢,-~¢ E L We define ---., ,---, and A as usual. We also define the duals of our modal operators in the usual fashion: G~b - ~F~¢ (~b is always going to be the case), H~b = -~P--,¢ (~b always has been the case), C~b ~. ~O--,q~ (~b holds at all overlapping intervals) and El~b ~ ~O~b (~b is true at all 'daughter' intervals). Two additional defined operators will play an important role in what follows: Me = P~b V O~b V F~b, and its dual L¢ ~_ ~M~¢. It follows from the semi-linear time semantics adopted below that M~b means '~b holds at some time' and L~b means '~b holds at all times'. We will often abbreviate <>(p A ~b) using the expression (p)~b and abbreviate a sequence of such applications (Pl)'\" (p,,)~b using the expression {pl\"\" \"p,)¢. We adopt a similar practice for the dual forms: [p]$ is shorthand for r3(p :... ¢) and [Pl \" \"P,,]$ is shorthand for [Pa]'\" [P,,]¢. We also write <)n (or t3\") to stand for a length n sequence of 0s (or 13s). Semantics. Let T be a set of intervals (which we will think of as nodes), and let ~, < and e be binary relations on T. As < models temporal precedence, it must be irreflexive and transitive, o models temporal overlap (phonological association), and so it is reflexive and symmetric. < and o interact as follows: (i) they are disjoint, (ii) for any tl, t2, t3, t4 G T, tl < t2 o t3 < t4 implies tl < t4 (that is, precedence is transitive through overlap), and (iii) for any t~, t2 E T, tl < t2 orhot2 orb > t2 (thatis, our conception of time is semi-linear). Note that the triple (T, <, o) is what temporal logicians call an interval structure.","The remaining relation ~ encodes the hierarchical organization of phonological structures. As a phonological unit overlaps all of its constituents (cf. Hayes 1990:44), we demand that the transitive closure of 8 be contained within o. Furthermore, phonological structures are never cyclic and so we require that for any h , . . . , t, ~ T, if h tt~ ..... tn-l~tn then it is not the case that t,,btl. By a phonological frame F we mean a quadruple (T, <, o, B}:of the type just described.","It merely remains to link L with such structures. A valuation V is a function (X t3 N) --* 2 T that obeys three constraints. First, it must assign a singleton set to each nominal. Second, for each t E T, there is an i 6 N such that V(i) = {t}. Third, fib,t2 ~ V(p) wherep ~ X then tl o tu ---* t~ = t2. In short, valuations are functions which ensure nominals act as: names, where all intervals are named, and valuations capture the idea that phonological 'tiers' are linearly ordered. A model for L is a pair (F, V). Satisfaction. Let M = (F, V):, t E T, a ~ X O N.

As we shall see, the hierarchical prosodic structures of phonology are highly constrained. For example, syllables dominate moras and not the other way around, and so a structure where there is a mora dominating a syllable is ill-formed. Following (Bird 1990), we express these restrictions on dominance by augmenting the sort lattice with a binary' 'appropriateness' relation A, represented graphically using arrows. We can express in L the constraints captured by such appropriateness graphs. For example, L(p --, -~Oq) expresses the fact that a node with sort p cannot dominate a node with sort q. We can also use L to express stronger ¢o~traints. For example, L(p -. Oq) expresses the fact that a node of sort p must dominate at least one node of sort q.

CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["In this article we have presented an application of interval based tense logic to 'non-linear' phonology (specifically, 'autosegmental' phonology, Goldsmith 1990), and exemplified it using data from Arabic (McCarthy 1981). The chief difference between this view of phonology and its purely segmental predecessors is its use of overlapping intervals of time.","As argued in (Bh'd 1990), the three primitives: dominance, precedence and overlap are sufficient to represent hierarchically and temporally organized phonological structure. Here we have taken a standard language of interval based tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator <> to express phonological dominance, and employed nominals to enable us to label nodes. A universal theory of syllable structure was expressed in L, to which further generalizations were added for Arabic. We then showed how so-called 'non-concatenative' morphology might be treated, and in-dicated how the phonological notions of extramela'icality and licensing were cashed out. The analysis of Arabic did not require recourse to separate consonant and vowel tiers (following Hudson 1986). Rather, consonantisms (and vocalisms) are simply partially specified phonological structures which may be combined using logical conjunction. Even so, the exemplification given was for but a tiny fragment of Arabic phonology and much work is still to be done. For example, nothing was said about the vocalisms.","The move from linear to non-linear phonology parallels the move from a purely Priorean tense logic in F and P to interval based systems in F, P and O. The view of phonology emerging from the present study is significantly more formal than many of its contemporaries (eL Bird & Ladd 1991), and suggests that enhanced modal formalisms may provide a natural foundation for rigorous phonological theorizing.","Finally, there would seem to be good reasons for being confident that complex phonological descriptions can now be fully incorporated into feature structure based grammar frameworks. Reape's (1991) logical foundation for these frameworks and the phonological arguments in favour of adopting feature structures (Hayes 1990, Bird 1991) are but two parts of the one story. 10Note that the exhaustiveness condition"]},{"title":"L(a ~ i V j)","paragraphs":["and the sequencing constraints in the earlier version of (I1) must be expressed here also.
