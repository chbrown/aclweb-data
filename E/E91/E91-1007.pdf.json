We also have been forced to omit much detail from the description and verification of our algorithm. A full report on this work will be available in the near fu-ture.","2. UNIFICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF CONSTRAINTS 2.1 Constraints on feature structures Not every feature structure is a possibility as the ultimate output of the parsing mechanism. Typically, there are constraints which must be observed. One way of ensuring this sort of consistency is to build the checks right into the grammar, so that the feature structures generated are always legitimate substructures of tile final output. The CLG formalism (Dumas and Vatlie, 1989) is an example of such a philosophy. |n many ways, this is an attractive option~ because it provides a - 33 - unified context for expressing all aspects of the grammar. liowever, this approach has the disadvantage that it limits the use of independent parsing subalgorithms whose results are subsequently unified, since the consistency checks nmst be performed before the feature structures are presented to the unifier. There-fore, to maintain such independence, it would be a distinct advantage if some of the constraint checking could be relegated to the unification process.","To establish a formal framework in which this is possible, we must start by extending our notion of a feature structure. Following the ideas of Moshier and Rounds (1987) and Langholm (1989), we define an extended fcature structure to be a pair (N, K:) in which /C is a set of feature structures and N is the least element of/C under the ordering _. (Titus, by definition, K: has a least element, and K: determines N.) Think of N a.s the \"current\" feature structure, and/C as the set of all structures into which N is allowed to grow. We define (N~,K:t) C:~ (N~,/C~) to mean precisely that K~ C_ /C~. In other words, the set of all structures which N~ can grow into is a subset of those which N~ can grow into. (It follows necessarily that N~ ~_ N2 in this case.) Note that if we identify the ordinary feature structure N with the pair (N,"]},{"title":"IM I N ~ M}),","paragraphs":["we precisely recapture ordinary subsumption. Finally, the notion of unification associated with _~ is given by","(Mr,/Ct) LI= (M~,/C:~) = (M,/~ 17/C2) if/C~ n/c2","has a least element M; undefined oOmrwise. 2.2 Logical feature structures with constraints To operate on pairs of the form (N~/C) algorithmically, we must have in place an appropriate representation for the set g:. There are many possible choices; ours is to let it be the set of all structures satisfying a set of sentences iu a particular logic. The logic which we use is a simple modification of the language of Rounds and Ka.sper (1986) (see also (Kasper and Rounds, 1990)) admitting negation but only binary path equivalences. Specifically, an atomic feature term is one of the following. FormltJa T ± (~: a)"]},{"title":"(,~","paragraphs":["×"]},{"title":"f~)","paragraphs":["Semantics The identically true term. The identically false term. The path (nesting of attributes) cz exists","and terminates with label a. The paths cr and /? have a common end","point (coalesced end points). In (a : a), the label a may be T, denoting a missing value. The notation (a ~ /~) is borrowed from (Langholm, 1989), and has the same semantics as {,,B} of(Rounds and Kasper, 1986). A (general)featur~ term is b.ilt up from atomic feature terms using the connectives ,̂ v, and -., with the usual semantics. In particular, the negation we use is the classical notion; a structure satisfes (-,~0) if and only if it does not satisfy ~. For any set • of feature terms, Mod(&) denotes the set of all feature structures for which each","E r~ is true. For a formal definition of satisfaction, we refer the reader to the above-cited references. In-tuitively, any set of terms which defines a consistent rooted, directed graph is satisfiable. Ilowever, let us specifically remark that only nodes with no outgoing edges may have labels other than T, that labels other than T may occur at at most one end point, that no two outgoing edges from the same node may have the same label, and that any term of the form (a : .L) is equivalent to _L, and so inconsistent.","Now we define a logical extended feature structure (LoXF) to be an extended feature structure iN, K:) in which K: = Mod(¢) for some consistent finite set ~ of feature terms. In particular, Mod(~) must have a least model. We also denote this pair by Y(~) = (g.,Mod(~b)). Now Y(~b,) E_, ~'(~2) reduces to Mod(~) C_ Mod(4,a), and"]},{"title":"{ ~(~","paragraphs":["u"]},{"title":"¢2)","paragraphs":["undefined if Mod(&a U q~) has a least element under E; otherwise. 2.3 Remark on negation A full discussign of the nature of negation in LoXF's is complex, and will be the focus of a separate paper. IIowever, because this topic has received a great deal of attention (Moshier and Rounds, 1987), (Langholm, 1989), (Dawar and Vijay-Shanker, 1990), we feel it essential to remark here that ~'(¢~) does not have the \"classical\" negation semantics which can be determined by looking solely at the least element. Indeed, the appropriate definition is that .~'(~) satisfies -'7' precisely when no member of Mod(&) satisfies ¢; in other words, the structure N. is not allowed to be extended to satisfy ~o. 2.4 Unification algorithms for logical extended feature structures In view of the definition immediately above, it is easy to see that that any unification algorithm for LoXF's must solve the following two problems in the course of attempting to unify ~'(~i) and ~'(~2).","(ul) It must decide whether or not ~i U q~2 is consistent; i.e., whether or not there is a feature structure satisfying all sentences of both ~i and cb2.","(u2) In case that 4~I U~2 is satisfiable, it must also determine if there is a least model, and if so, identify it.","Now it is well known that (ul) is an NP-complete problem, even if we disallow negation and path equivalence (Rounds and Kasper, 1986, Thin. 4). Therefore, barring the eventuality that P = NP, we cannot expect to allow ~I and ~2 to be arbitrary finite sets of feature terms and still have a tractable algorithm for unification. One solution, which has been taken by a number of authors, such as Kasper (1989) and Eisele and D6rre (1988), is to devise clever algorithms which apply to the general case and appear empirically to work well on \"typical\" inputs, but still are provably - 34 - exponential in the worst case. While such work is undeniably of great value, we here propose a companion strategy; namely, we restrict attention to pairs {N, ~) such that the very nature of • guarantees a tractable algorithm. 3. HORN FEATURE LOGIC","In the field of mathematicM logic in general, and in the computational logic relevant to computer science in particular, Horn clauses play a very special r61e (Makowsky, 1987). Indeed, they form the basis for the programming language Prolog (Sterling and Shapiro, 1986) and the database language Datalog (Ceri et ai., 1989). This is due to the fact that while they possess substantial representational power, tractable inference algorithms are well known. It is perhaps the main the-sis of this work that the utility of llorn clauses carries over to computational linguistics as well. 3.1 Horn feature clauses A feature literal is either an atomic feature term (e.g., (~: a), (~ ~-. /~), or _L) or its negation. A feature clause is a finite disjunction £lvt~v...vl,n of feature literals. A feature clause is florn if at most one of the ti's is not negated. A Horn extended feature structure ( lloXF) is a LoXF ~'(4,) such that • is a finite set of llorn feature clauses. 3.2 A taxonomy of Horn feature clauses Before moving on to a presentation of algorithms on tIoXF's, it is appropriate to provide a brief sketch of thc utility and limits of restricting our attention: to collections of lIorn clauses, hnplication here is classical;","in the case of ordinary propositional logic, we use the notation et~̂r~.̂.. âm =~ p to denote the clause ~O'l v-~0r2v... V'~O'rnVp. Horn feature clauses may then be thought of as falling into one of the following four categories.","(lIl) A clause of the form a, consisting of a single positive literal, is just a fact.","(lI2) A clause of the form -~e, consisting of a single negative literal, is a negated fact. In terms of lloXF's, if -~a E ¢, this means that within ~'(&), no extension of N¢ in which a is true is permitted. As a concrete example, a constraint stating that a subject may not have an attribute named \"tense\" would be of this form.","(H3) A clause of the form ai *̂2 ... am =~ p is called a rule or an implication. Numerous examples of the utility of implication in linguistics are identified in (Wedekind, 1990, Sec. 1.3). Kasper's conditional descriptions (Kasper, 1988) are also a form of implication. More concretely, the requirement that a transitive verb requires a direct object is easily expressed in this form.","(114) A clause of the form alâ2.̂..âm =~ 1 is","called a compound negation. The formalization","of the constraint that a verb cannot be both in-","transitive and take a direct object is an example","of the use of such a clause,","The type of knowledge which is not recapturable using","llorn feature logic is positive disjunction; i.e., formu-","las of tim form ~rlva2, with both a.l and aa feature terms. Of course, this has nothing in particular to do with feature-term logic, but is well-known limita-tion of Itorn clauses in general. However, in accepting this limitation, we also obtain many key properties, including tractable inference and the following important property of genericity. 3.3 Totally generic LoXF'a Let now • be any finite set of feature terms. We say that • is totally generic if, for any set q of facts (see (H1) above), if Mod(O 0 #) is nonempty then it contains a least element under E. Intuitively, if we use • to define the LoXF ~(~), total genericity says that however we extend the base feature structure N¢ (consistently with O), we will continue to have a LoXF. Remarkably, we have the following. 3.4 Theorem A set of feature terms ~p is totally generic if and only if it is equivalent to a set of Horn feature clauses. Proof outline: This result is essentially a translation of (Makowsky, 1987, Thm. 1.9) to the logic Of feature structures. In words, it says that if (and only if) we work with lloXF's, condition (u2) on page 4 becomes superfluous (except for explicitly identifying the least model.) t3","4. THE EXTENDED UNIFICATION ALGORITHM","It has been shown by Dowling and Gallier (1984) that satisfiability for finite sets of propositional IIorn formulas can be tested in time linear in the length of the formulas. Their algorithms can easily be modified to deliver the least model as well. Since unification of HoXF's is essentially testing for satisfiability plus identifying the least model (see (ul)-u(2) on the previous page), a natural approach would be to adapt one of their algorithms. Essentially, this is what we do. Like theirs, our algorithm is ]orward chaininff, we start with the facts and \"fire\" rules until no more can be fired, or until a contradiction appears. However, the adaptation is not trivial, because feature-term logic is more expressive than propositional logic. In particular, feature-term logic contains countably many tautologies which have no correlates in ordinary propositional logic. The main contribution of our algorithm is to implicitly recapture the full semantics of these tautologies while keeping the time complexity within reasonable bounds. Due to space limitations, we cannot present tile full formality of the rather complex data structures. Rather, to highlight tile key features, we step through an annotated example. We focus only upon the special problems inherent in the extension to feature-term logic, and assume familiarity with the forward-chaining algorithm in (Dowling and Gallier, 1984) and the graph unification algorithm in (Colban, 1990). 4.1 An example theory and extended feature graplm The set E contains the following eight llorn feature clauses.

Note that rule ~s never fires, and that there are virtual edges and nodes left at the conclusion of the process. 4.3 A taxonomy of implicit rules for sets of Horn feature clauses As we remarked in the in-troduction to this section, to correctly adapt forward chaining to the context of IIoXF's, we must implicitly iticlude the semantics of countably many tautologies. These fall into three classes. (il) Whenever an atomic term of the form (or// : a)","is determined to be true (ap denotes the concate- ,nation of a and fl), and another term of the form - 36 - (c, : T) occurs as au antecedent of a ilorn feature clause, (with either fl not the empty string or else a :fl T), we must be able to automatically make the deduction of the tautology (oq~ : a) =~ (~ : T) to conclude that (c~ : T) is now true. We call this node and path subsumption. In computing the least model of =, the deductions (AA: a) =~ CA: T) and (B : a) =~ (B : T) are examples of such rules.","(i2) Whenever we deduce two terms of the form (a : a) and (fl : a) to be true, with a ~ T, we must implicitly realize the semantics of the rule (a : a)(̂fl : a) ~ (a x fl), due to tile constraint that non-T labels are unique. We call this label matching. In computing the least model of E, tile deduction (AA : a)A(B : a) ::*. (AA X B) is a specific example.","(i3) Whenever we coalesce two paths, we must perform local unification on the subgraph rooted at the point of coalescence. More precisely, if we coalesce the paths cY and fl, and the atom (~7 : a) is true, we re,st deduce that both (cr7 x [/7) and (f17 : a) are true; i.e., we must implicitly realize the compound rule (c¢ y. fl)(̂c*7 : a) =~ (a'r x f17)(̂f17 : a). This is just a logical representation of local unification. In computing the least model of E, a specific example is the deduction (CCD ~ ABD)(̂CCDDG : t) (CCDDG .~ ABDDG)(̂ABDDG : t). 4.4 Data structures To support these inferences, several specific data structures are supported. They are sketched below.","(dl) There is tile list of clauses. Each clause has a counter associated with it, indicating the number of literals which remain to be fired before its left-hand side is satisfied. When this count drops to zero, the clause fires and its consequent becomes true.","(d2) There is a list of atoms which occur in the an-tecedents of clauses. With each literal is associated a set of pointers, one to each clause of which it is an antecedeut literal. When an atom becomes true, the appropriate clauses are notified, so they may decrement their counters.","(d3) Tile working extended fealure structure, as illustrated in Figures 1-4, is maintained throughout.","(d4) For each node in the working extended feature structure, a list of atoms is maintained. If the node label is a, then each such atom in the list is of the form (c~ : a), with c, a path from the root node to the node under consideration. When that node becomes actual, that atom is notified that is is now satisfied.","(d5) For each non-T node label a which occurs in some atom, a list of all virtual nodes with that label is maintained. When one such node becomes actual, the other are checked to see if an inference of the form (i2) should be made.","(dr) For each atom of the form (or x fl) occurring as an antecedent in some clause, the nodes at the ends of tl,ese paths in the working extended feature structure are endowed with a common tag. Whenever nodes are coalesced, a check for such common tags is made, so the appropriate atom may be notified that it is now true. 4.5 Independent processes and unification The algorithm also maintains a ready queue of available processes. These processes are of three types. A process of the form Actual(or : a), when executed, makes the identified path and label actual in the extended feature graph. A process of the form Coalesce(hi,ha) coalesces the end points of the two nodes nl and n2 in the extended feature graph. A process of the form Unify(n) performs a local unification at the subgraph rooted at node n, using an algorithm such as identified in (Colban, 1990). All processes in the ready queue commute; they may be executed in any order.","To unify two distinct sets of terms (perhaps generated by independent parts of a parser), we join their two extended feature graphs at the root, merge the corresponding data structures, and add the command Unify(root) to the merged process queue. In other words, we perform a unification to match common information, and then continue with the inference process. 4.6 The complexity of the unification algorithm Define the length of a literal to be the number of attribute name and attribute value occurrences in it. Thus, for example, length((AB ~ CD)) = 4 and length((ABCD : a)) = 5. For a set cb of tlorn feature clauses, we further define the following quantities. L = The length of ~I,; i.e., the sum of the lengths of all literals occurring in 4~. P = The number of distinct terms of the form (or fl) which occur as the right-hand side of a rule in &. (Facts are not considered to be rules here.) m = The number of distinct attributes in the input. (If we collect all of the literMs occurring in tile clauses of • and discard any negation to yield a large pool of facts, then m is tile number of edges in the graph representing the associated feature structure. If ~ is a set of positive iiterals to begin with, and hence represents an ordinary feature structure, then m represents the size of this feature structure.) We then have the following theorem. 4.7 Theorem The worst.case time complexity of our IloXF unification algorithm is O(L + (P + 1). m. w(m)), where a~(m) is an inverse Ackermann/unction (which grows more slowly than than any primitive recursive function - for all practical purposes w(n) <_ 5). 121","This may be compared to tile worst-case complexity of the usual algorithm for unifying ordinary feature structures, which is O(m.w(m)). The increase in complexity over this simpler case is due to two factors.","(cl) We must read the entire input; since iiterals may be repeated, it is possible that L > m; hence tile L term.","(c2) Each time that we deduce that two nodes must be coalesced, we must perform a unification. This can occur at most P times - the number of times that a rule can assert a distinct coalescing of nodes. -37-4.8 Further remarks on the algorithm Note in particular that there are no restrictions on where path equivalences"]},{"title":"(e.g., (or ~. ~))","paragraphs":["may occur in Horn feature clauses.

CONCLUSIONS, FURTHER DIItEC-TIONS~ AND PROJECT STATUS 5.1 Conclusions and further directions We have identified lloXF's as an attractive compromise between ordinary feature structures (in which there is no way to express constraints on growth) and full logical feature theories (for which the unification problem is NP-complete). We view lloXF's not as the \"best\" apl~roach, but rather as a tool to be used to buihl better overall unification-based grammar formalisms. The obvious next step is to develop an integrated framework in which IloXF's are employed to handle negation and the disjunction arising from implication, while other techniques handle more general disjunction and term subsumption (Smolka, 1988). Such an optimized approach could lead to much faster overall handling of negation and disjunction, but further work is clearly needed to bear this out. 5.2 Status of the project While the algorithm has been spelled out in considerable detail, we have just begun to build an actual implementation of the IIoXF unifier in the programming language Scheme. We expect to complete the implementation by the summer of 1991.
