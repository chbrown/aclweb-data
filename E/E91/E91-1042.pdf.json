The: need for a methodology is obvious. First steps have been made in expert system research, where both domain andtask are for the most part clearly specifiable.

This requires a transfer of insights from linguistic research into knowledge engineering. In the ideal case, structures of the model will be strongly influenced by natural language analyses.","Linguistic knowledge is relevant in various respects: Word orientation, for example, implies close hxterrelationships with research on lexical knowledge: afrdiated generic terms, discriminating features, idiosyncratic aspects of use, etc. However, you may run into difficulties by relating syntactic categories (like word classes) with conceptual structures. So thematic roles cannot be directly trmtsformed into ontological roles as a part of the background knowledge.

Text understanding phenomena like annphora resolution can only be accounted by accessing background knowledge concerning interconceptual relation. The tourists went for a boat trip. They took the seats on the sundeck, s In order to capture the meaning of these sentences, three:steps have to be inferred: A boat trip is usually undertaken with a boat; a boat often has a sundeck; and a sundeck mostly of-fers seats. 3.2 Demands Resulting from the Domain In the LEU/2 context, we have to deal with the comprehensive task of text understanding mtd a relatively narrow domain.

This leads us to the requlremcnt of both all object-oriented and all event-oriented part of the eoncephlal hierarchy. Consequently, one of our basic design decisions is due to J. Hobbs (cf. [llobbs et al., 1987]) and results ill a reification of predicates. So in our model all events, states etc. have concept status on their own. This technique enables us to model the case frames for verbs in all analogical manner to the lexical entrie~ of the analyzing component as well as to incorporate tile structures for events etc. within the categories alike the definitions for objects 121 It makes sense to think about objects as wcU as about events in terms of their spatial mad temporal environment, although these knowleklge specifications will obviously be quite different. An example taken from the event cluster may serve as an illustration of several consequences of the criteria mentioned above. As to the breadth of the model, the relevance of the event part of the ontology appears intuitively plausible with respect to our domain, namely a scenario of cities, with modifying events. We have to deal with sights of the city like facades of important.buildings, and the events of modification related to them show a considerable resemblance of ilnportant features of meaning - although the verbs are no real synonyms in the linguistic sense. Figure 2 shows a screen dump witll the relevant part of' the concept hierarchy. The picture illustrates the effect of bundling that the introduction!: of adequate superconcepts has, and which allows for structured inferencing in terms of system efficiency, hi this part of our concept llicr~chy the boarderlinc between Upper Structure attd Lower Structure is clearly identifiable. When descending the hierarchy, the sort KONSTRUKTIVSIT falls out into several domain-dependent subsorts. The figure is followed by the respective sort expressions written in the bt.xLoo list structure(the sort KONSTRUKTIVSIT in the figur© corresponds to CONSTRUC~PION in the English list of sort expressions), expanded by roles and features which do not appear in tile graphic representatimt.

This kind of structured modelling allows to dispense with writing similar axioms for a number of resembling events. In order to demonstrate task orientation, it would be necessary to consider a broader part of the ontology, because aspects like intention, causality or culmination have been modeUed separately. In addition, one would have to take a closer look at the ensemble of connected components in the system. The limitation of the depth of the model can be seen from the fact that the event concepts discussed do not have more differentiated subconcepts mid, of course, from the fact that not nil possible roles and features have been integrated into the model. In a scenario \"protection of historical monuments\", for example, the instruments of renovation might be central and would induce a partly different granularity in the model.

During the conceptian and implementation of the modules in our prototype, this discussion was reflected by a considerable flexibility in the division Of functions between semantic analysis and inferential processes. During the integration, descriptive parts of linguistic theories had to be completed with procedural or functional aspects. Typical tats fits appeared eadl time it was clear what should be ezpre~sed within certMn modules (like morphology or syntax), but it was unclear how to proceed from one module to the next. In the ideal case, this allowed for conclusions:on in-compatibilities between the levels of linguistic analysis corresponding to the respective, modules. One of these phenomena is the identification of adjectival passive constructions versus regular verb: The museum will be opened at 11 a.ln. 14 . The illuSelllU is open from 9 to 15 t'. According to Vendler's classifies,toni open should be categorized as an event in the first sentence and, combined with to be in the second case, as a state. The integration I of the modules showed that none of the system components was able to deliver this differentiation - in this case, the reason was the incompatibility between unsorted unification grauunars and the necessity to overwrite default vMues. l.n the fold of Knowledge Engineering, the question how to make contents of one lu~owl. edge base available to n second one (n6rmally with quite another kind of task setting) has been receiving growi.g attention. One of the most interesting parts of this problem ~:onsists in the iuterrelationship between cotluuon sense - and domain specific knowledge. We hope to contribute some important steps towards handling this problenx by making explicit a nunxbet of common sense oriented modelling decisions within the LILOG context. It is obvious, though, that both background knowledge for natural language processing and the adequate implementation of metainfornmtion for knowledge base contents will be an ongoing affair for the next years.
