INTRODUCTION In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the limited size of existing computational lexicons and the poverty of the semantic information they contain represents one of the primary bottlenecks in the development of realistic natural language processing (NLP) systems. The need for extensive lexical and semantic databases is evident in the recent initiation of a number of projects to construct massive generic lexicons for NLP (project GENELEX in Europe or EDR in Japan). The manual coustruction of large lexical-semantic databases demands enormous human resources, and there is a growing body of research into the possibility of automatically extracting at least a part of the required lexical and semantic informati'on from everyday dictionaries. Everyday dictionaries are obviously not structured in a way that enables their immediate use in NLP systems, but several Studies have shown that relatively simple procedures can be used to extract taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for example, Amsler, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Cbodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens, 1986; Byrd"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1987; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988; Vtronis and Ide, 1990~ Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1990). However, it remains to be seen whether information automatically extracted from dictionaries is sufficiently complete and coherent to be actually usable in NLP systems. Although there is concern over the quality of automatically extracted lexical information, very few empirical studies have attempted to assess it systematically, and those that have done so have been restricted to consideration of the quality of grammatical information (e.g., Akkerman, Masereeuw, and Meijs, 1985). No evaluation of automatically extracted semantic information has been published. The authors would like to thank Lisa Lassck and Anne Gilman for their contribution to this work. In this paper, we report the results of a quantitative evaluation of automatically extracted sernanuc data. Our results show that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the extracted information is garbled in some way. These results at first call into doubt the validity of automatic extraction from dictionaries. However, in section 4 we show that these results can be dramatically reduced to about 6% by several means--most significantly, by combining the information extracted from five dictionaries. It therefore appears that even if individual dictionaries are an unreliable source of semantic information, multiple dictionaries can play an important role in building large lexical-semantic databases. 2. METHODOLOGY Our strategy involves automatically extracting hypernyms from five English dictionaries for a limited corpus.

We deal with words within a domain which poses few modelling problems, and we focus on hyperonymy, which is probably the least arguable semantic relation and has been shown to be the easiest to extract. If the results are poor under such favorable constraints, we can foresee that they will be poorer for more complex (abstract) domains and less clearly cut relations. An ideal hicrarchy probably does not exist for the entire dictionary; however, a fair degree of consensus seems possible for carefully chosen terms within a very restricted domain. We have therefore selected a corpus of one hundred kitchen utensil terms, each representing a concrete, individual object--for example,"]},{"title":"cup, fork, saucepan, decanter,","paragraphs":["etc. All of the terms are count nouns.

This makes it easy to apply simple tests for hyperonymy, which, for instance, enable us to say that Y is a hypcmym of X if \"this is an X\" entails but is not entailed by \"this is a Y\" (Lyons, 1963). Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn (1985) proposed a heuristic for extracting hypernyms which exploits the fact that definitions for nouns typically give a hypemym - 227 - term as the head of the defining noun phrase. Consider the following examples: dipper a ladle used for dipping... ICEDi ladle a long-handled spoon... ICED] spoon a metal, wooden, or plastic utensil... ICED] In very general terms, the heuristic consists of extracting the word which precedes the first preposition, relative pronoun, or participle encountered in the definition text. When this word Is \"empty\" (e.g. one, any, kind, class) the true hyperuym is the head of the noun phrase following the preposition of'. slice any of various utensils... [CEDI Automatically extracted hierarchies are necessarily tangled (Amsler, 1980) because many words are polysemous. For example, in the CED, the word pan has the following senses (among others): pan ! l.a a wide metal vessel... ICEDI pan 2 1 the leaf of the betel tree.., iCED] The CED also gives pan as the hypemym for saucepan, which taken together yields the hierarchy in figure l.a. The tangled hierarchy is problematic because, following the path upwards from saucepan, we find that saucepan can be a kind of leaf. This is clearly erroneous. A hierarchy utilizing senses rather than words would not be tangled, as shown in figure 1.b. In our study, the hierarchy waS disambiguated by hand. Sense disambiguation in dictionary definitions is a difficult problem, and we will not address it here; this problem is the focus of much current research and is considered in depth elsewhere (e.g., Byrd et al., 1987; Byrd, 1989; Vtronis and Ide, 1990; Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990). vessel leaf vessel I leaf l"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["saucepan saucepan I a) v,,ord hitrarchy b) sense hierarchy Figure I : Sense-tangled\" hierarchy 3. EVALUATION Hierarchies constructed with methods such as those outlined in section 2 show, upon close inspection, several serious problems. In this section, we describe thc most pervasive problems and give their frequency in our five dictionaries. The problems fall into two general types: those which arise because information in the dictionary is incomplete, and those which are the result of a lack of distinction among terms and the lack of a one-to-one mapping between terms and concepts, especially at the highest levels of the hierarchy. 3.1. Incomplete information The information in dictionaries is incomplete for two main reasons. First, since a dictionary is typically the product of several lexicographers' efforts and is constructed, revised, and updated over many years, there exist inconsistencies in the criteria by which the hypernyms given in definition texts are chosen. In addition, space and readability restrictions, on the one hand, and syntactic restrictions on phrasing, on the other, may dictate that certain information is unspecified in definition texts or left to be implied by other parts of the definition. 3.1.1. Attachment too high : 21-34% The most pervasive problem in automatically extracted hierarchies is the attachment of terms too high in the hierarchy. It occurs in 21-349'0 of the definitions in our sample from the five dictionaries (figure 8). For example, while pan and bottle are vessels in the CED, cup and bowl are simply containers, the hypemym of vessel. Obviously, \"this is a cup\" and \"this is a bowl\" both entail (and are not entailed by) \"this is a vessel\". Further, other dictionaries give vessel as the hypemym for cup and bowl. Therefore, the attachment of cup and bowl to the higher-level term container seems to be an inconsistency within the CED. The problem of attachment too high in the hierarchy occurs relatively randomly within a given dictionary. In dictionaries with a controlled definition vocabulary (such as the LDOCE), the problem of attachment at high levels of thehierarchy results also from a lack of terms from which to choose. For example, ladle and dipper are both attached to spoon in the LDOCE, although \"this is a dipper\" entails and is not entailed by \"this is a ladle\". There is no way that dipper could be defined as a ladle (as, for instance, in the CED), since ladle is not in the defining vocabulary. As a result, hierarchies extracted from the LDOCE are consistently flat (figure 7). 3.1.2. Absent hypernyms : 0-3% In some cases, strategies likc that of Chodorow, Byrd and Hcidorn yield incorrect hypernyms, as in the following definitions: g r ill A grill is a part of a cooker... [COBUILD] corkscrew a pointed spiral piece of metal... [W9I dinner service a ecm~plete set of plates and dishes... [LDOCE,","not included in our corpus] The words part, piece, set, are clearly not hypernyms of the defined concepts: it is virtually meaningless to say that grill is a kind of part, or that corkscrew is a kind of piece. In these cases, the head of the noun phrase serves to mark another relation: part-whole, member-class, etc. It is easy to reject these and similar words (member, :series, etc.) as hypemyms, since they form a closed list (Kiavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990). However, excluding these words leaves us with no hypernym. We call these \"absent hypernyms\"; they occur in 0-3% of the definitions in our sample corpus (figure 8). The absence of a hypernym in a given definition text does not necessarily imply that no hypernym exists. For example, \"this is a corkscrew\" clearly entails (and is not entailed by) \"this is a device\" (the hypemym given by the COBUILD and the CED). In many eases, the lack of a hypernym seems to be the result of concern over space and/or readability. We can imagine, for example, that the definition for corkscrew could be more fully specified as \"a device consisting of a pointed spiral piece of metal...\" In such cases, lexicographers rely on the reader's ability to deduce that something made of metal, with a handle, used for pulling corks, can be called a device. However, for some terms, such as cutlery or dinner service, it is not clear that a hypernym exists. Note that we have voluntarily excluded problematic terms of this kind from our corpus, in order to restrict our evaluation to the best Case. 3.1.3. Missing overlaps : 8-14% Another problem results from the necessary choices that lexicographers must make in an attempt to specify a - 228 - single superordinate, when concepts in the real world overlap freely. For instance, a saucepan can be said to be a pot as well as a pan. \"This is a saucepan\" entails both \"this is a pot\" (the hypernym given by the CED and W9) as well as \"this is a pan\" (the hypernym given by the LDOCE, OALD, and COBUILD). On the other hand, \"this is a pot\" does not entail and is not entailed by \"this is a pan\", which is to say thatpot andpan are not synonyms, nor is one the hypernym of the other. In terms of classes, pan and pot are distinct but overlapping, and saucepan is a subset of their intersection (figure 2.a). This is no longer a strict hierarchy since it includes merging branches (figure 2.b). We will call it an \"overlapping hierarchy\". Although a tree representation of such a hierarchy is impossible, it presents no problems on either logical or computational grounds. b) saucepan","Figure 2. Overlapping hierarchy Assuming the above relations, it would be more logically correct to phrase the definition of saucepan as \"a pan AND a pot...\". However, lexicographers never use \"and\" in this way, but usually give only one of the alternatives. For example, each of the five dictionaries in our study chooses eitherpot orpan as the genus term for saucepan. When this occurs, one of the hypemyms is missing. This problem arises in our sample corpus relatively frequently, 8-14% of the time depending on the dictionary (figure 8). 3.2. Difficulties at higher levels At the higher levels of the hierarchy, terms necessarily become more general, and they often become less clearly defined. For example, most people wilt agree on whether some object falls imo the category fork or spoon, but there is much less agreement on what objects are implements or utensils. In addition, at the higher levels some concepts simply lack a term to designate them exactly. As a result~ there is confusion at the higher levels of hierarchies implicit in dictionary definitions. 3.2.1. OR-conjoined heads : 7-10% For 7-10% of the terms in our corpus, definitions give a list of head nouns separated by the conjunction or, as in the following: utensil an implement, tool or container... [CEDI In this case, none of the three alternatives is a hypemym of utensil. First, it is clearly not true that \"this is a utensil\" entails \"this is a container\". For the other two, it is not clear whether or not \"this is a utensil\" entails \"this is a tool\" and \"this is an implement\", and it is even less clear that the reverse entailments do not apply. Regarding the three terms as hypernyms of utensil would produce the hierarchy in figure 3. However, by enumerating the paths upwards from spatula (defined as a utensil), we see that spatula is a kind of container, which is obviously incorrect. This solution amounts to regarding the class of utensils as the intersection of the classes of implements, tools, and containers. Regarding the conjunction or as denoting the union of these classes would be more correct on logical grounds, since if X is included in A or X is included in B, then X is included in A u B. This relation cannot be fitted into a tree, but it can be pictured as in figure 4. However, this does not help to determine whether spatula is an implement, tool, or container, or some subset of the three. In any case, lexicographers do not use or with a consistent, mathematical meaning. Or-conjoined heads appear not to be usable in constructing hierarchical trees without considerable manipulation and addition of information.","implement tool container W~ONG/","spatula Figure 3 : problematic hierarchy Figure 4. OR as class union 3.2.2. Circularity : 7-11% It is well known that circularity exists in dictionary definitions, especially when concepts are high up in the hierarchy. For instance, consider the definitions below: tool an implement, such as a hammer... ICED] Implement a piece of equipment; tool or utensil. ICED] ute nsl I ar~ implement, tool or container... [CED] Circular definitions yield hierarchies containing loops (figure 5.a). Unlike merging branches, loops have no interpretation in terms of classes. A loop asserts both that A is a sub-class of B and B is a sub-class of A, which yields A := B. This is why Amsler (1980) suggests merging circularly-defined concepts and regarding them as synonyms (figure 5.b). container Implement ~~ut!/nunnu~ tool container","a) spatula b) spatula","Figure 5. Taxonomy with loops However, in most cases this solution leads to erroneous results; it is clear, for example, that many implements, tools, and utensils (e.g., spatula) are not containers. This problem is similar to the one cited above in section 3.2.1. If dictionary definitions are to be interpreted in terms of set theoretical relations, a more complex mathematical treatment is required. The definitions above can be represented by the following relations:","tool ~ implement","Implement c (equipment u tool u utensil)","utensil c (Implement u tool u container) which, once solved, do not equate tool, implement, and utensil, but instead define the overlapping classes in figure 6. This representation is clearly more sound on logical grounds. It still does not indicate exactly - 229 - whcrc spatula should appear (since wc have no indication that it is not a conlainer), but at least it shows that there may be some utensils which arc not containers. Although this representation is more intuitively accurate than the representation in figure 5.b, ultimately it goes • too far in delineating the relations among terms. In actual use, the distinctions among terms are much less clear-cut than figure 6 implies, For instance, the figure indicates that all tools that are containers are also implements, but it is certainly not clear that humans would agree to this or use the terms in a manner consistent with this specification. Dictionaries themselves do not agree, and when taken formally they yield very different diagrams for higher level concepts. object container \" gl!ss bow~e~l","plate tureen pressure, coffee- bottle pan cooker pot frying-pan saucepan container","Figure 6.

Summary Altogether, the problems described in the sections above yield a 55-70% error rate in automatically extracted hierarchies. Given that we have attempted to consider the most favorable case, it appears that any single dictionary, taken in isolation, is a poor source of automatically extracted semanlic information. This is made more cvidcm in figure 7, which demonstrates the marked differences in hierarchies extracted from the CED and LDOCE for a small subset of our corpus. A summary of our results appears in figure 8. COLliNS I.DOCE OALD W9 COMBINED Figure 8. (~uantitative evaluation 4. REFINING We have concluded that hierarchies extracted using strategies such as that of Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom are seriously flawed, and are therefore likely to be unusable in NLP systems. However, in this section we discuss various means to refine automatically extracted hierarchies, most of which can be pcrformcd automatically. 230 - WORD COIIUILD COLLINS LDocE 'OALD W9 ladle spoon spoon spoon h a s i n container container container ewer jug jug OR pitcher container saucepan pot pan pot grill (absent) devioe (absent) fork tool . implement instrument","Figure 9. Mer 4.1. Merging dictionaries It is possible to use information provided in the differentiae of definition texts to refine hierarchies; for example, in the definition vessel any object USI.:D AS a container... ICED] the automatically extracted hypernym is object. However, some additional processing of the definition text enables the extraction of container following the phrase \"used as\". It is also possible to use other definitions. For example, the CED does not specify that knife and spoon are implements, but this information is provided in the definition of cutlery: cutlery implements used for eating SUCII AS knives,","forks, and spoons. ICED] The extraction of information from differentiae demands some extra parsing, which may be difficult for complex definitions. Also, further research is required to determine which phrases function as markers for which kind of information, and to determine how consistent their use is. More importantly, such information is sporadic, and its extraction may require more effort than the results warrant. We therefore seek more \"brute force\" methods to improve automatically ex tracted hierarchies. One of the most promising strategies for refining extracted information is the Use of information from several dictionaries. Hierarchies derived from individual dictionaries suffer from incompleteness, but it is extremely unlikely that the same information is consistently missing from all dictionaries. For instance, the CED attaches cup to container, which is too high in the hierarchy, while the W9 attaches it lower, to vessel. It is therefore possible to use taxonomic information from several dictionaries to fill in absent hypemyms, missing links, and to rectify cases of too high attachment. To investigate this possibility, we merged the information extracted from the five English dictionaries in our database. The individual data for the five dictionaries was organized in a table, as in figure 9. Merging these hierarchies into a single hierarchy was accomplished automatically by applying a simple algorithm, which scans the table line-by-line, as follows:","1) regard cells containing multiple heads conjoined","by or as null, since, as we saw in section 3.2.1, they","do not reliably provide a hypemym. 2) if all the cells agree (as for ladle), keep that term as the hypernym. Otherwise: a) if a term is a hypernym of another term in the","line, ignore it. b) take the remaining cell or cells as the","hypernym(s).","This algorithm must be applied recursively, since, for","example, it may not yet be known when evaluating","bct~in that container is a hypernym of vessel, and vessel","is a hypemym of bowl, until those terms are themselves","• Combined spoon spoon spoon bowl vessel bowl pitcher pitcher OR jug ; pitcher pot ,, pan pot AND pan device utensil device AND utensil implement implement tool, implement AND instrument","ing hierarchies processed. Therefore, several passes through the tab!e are required. Note that if after applying the algorithm several terms are left as hypernyms for a given word, we effectively create an overlap in the hierarchy. For example, saucepen is attached to both pot and pan, and fork is attached to tool, implement, and instrument. We evaluate the quality of the resulting combined hierarchy using the same strategy applied in section 3. It is interesting to note that in the merged hierarchy, all the absent hypernym problems (including absence due to or-heads) have been eliminated, since in every case at least one of the five dictionaries gives a valid hypemym. In addition, almost all of the attachments too high in the hierarchy and missing overlaps have disappeared, although a few cases remain (5% and 1%, respectively). None of the dictionaries, for instance, gives pot as the hypemym of teapot, although three of the five dictionaries give pot as the hypernym of coffeepot. A larger dictionary database would enable the elimination of many of these remaining imperfections (for example, New Penguin English Dictionary, not included in our database, gives pot as a hypemym of teapot). Merging dictionaries on a large scale assumes that it is possible to automatically map senses across them. For our small sample, we mapped senses among dictionaries by hand. We describe elsewhere a promising method to automatically accomplish sense mapping, using a spreading activation algorithm (lde and Vtronis, 1990). 4.2. Covert categories There remain a number of circularly-defined hypemyms in the combined taxonomy, which demand additional consideration on theoretical grounds. Circularly-def'med terms tend to appear when lexicographers lack terms to designate certain concepts. The fact that \"it is not impossible for what is intuitively recognized as a conceptual category to be without a label\" has already been noted (Cruse, 1986, p. 147). The lack of a specific term for a recognizable concept tends to occur more frequently at the higher levels of the hierarchy (and at the very lowest and most specific levels as well--e.g., there is no term to designate forks with two prongs). This is probably because any language includes the most terms at the generic level (Brown, 1958), that is, the level of everyday, ordinary terms for objects and living things (dog, pencil, house, etc.). Circularity, as well as the use of or-conjoined terms at the high levels of the hierarchy, results largely from the lexicographers' efforts to approximate the terms they lack. For example, there is no clear term to denote that category of objects which fall under any of the terms utensil, tool, implement, instrument, although this concept seems to exist. Clearly, these terms are not strictly synonymous--there are, for example, utensils that one would not call tools (e.g., a colander). If a term, let us say X, for the concept existed, then the definitions for utensil, tool, implement, and instrument - 231 - could simply read \"an X that...\". Since this is not the case, lexicographers define each term with a list including the others, which enables the delineation of a concept which encompasses all of them. One way to resolve difficultieslat the higher levels of extracted hierarchies is to introduce \"covert categories\", that is, concepts which do not correspond to any particular word. We therefore do not merge circular terms into a single concept, but instead create a common \"covert\" hypcrnym for all of them. In this way,"]},{"title":"tool, utensil, implement;","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"instrument","paragraphs":["each appear in the hierarchy as kinds: of INSTRUMENTAL-OBJECT (covert categories names are capitalized).

Even if it is relatively easy to automatically detect circularities, the final determination of which covert categories to create and the terms that are involved in them must be done manually. However, this task is not as daunting as it may first appear, since it involves only the higher levels of the hierarchy, and likely involves a relatively small number of covert categories. 4.3. Summary By merging five dictionar!es, all but 6% of the problems found in individual dictionaries were eliminated (figure 8). This result is made clear in figure 10, which includes the same small subset of the sample corpus as in rite individual hierarchies given in figure 7. Although there remain a few imperfections, the combined hierarchy is much more accurate and complete, and therefore more useful, than the hierarchy derived from any one of the d~tionaries alone. 5. CONCLUSION The results of our study show that dictionaries can be a reliable source of automatically extracted semantic information. Merging information from several dictionaries improved the quality of extracted information to an acceptable level. However, these results were obtained for a selected corpus representing a best case situation. It is likely that different results will be obtained for larger, less restricted cases. Our results suggest that this is an encouraging line of research to pursuefor refining automatically extracted information.","REFERENCES","AKKERMAN, E., MASEREEUW, P. C., MEIJS. W. J. (1985).
