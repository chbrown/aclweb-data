These approaches all aim at controlling the combinatorial explosion of readings of sentences with multiple ambiguities. The common idea is to delay the enumeration of all readings for as long as possible. Instead, they work with a compact underspecified representation for as long as possible, only enumerating readings from this representation by need.","At first glance, many of these formalisms seem to be very similar to each other. Now the question arises how deep this similarity is — are all underspecification formalisms basically the same? This paper answers this question for Hole Semantics and normal dominance constraints, two logical formalisms used in scope underspecification, by defining a back-and-forth translation between the two. Due to fundamental differences in the way the two formalisms interpret underspecified descriptions, this encoding is only correct in a nonstandard sense. However, we identify a class of chain-connected underspecified representations for which these differences disappear, and the encoding becomes correct. We conjecture that all linguistically useful descriptions are chain-connected. To support this claim, we prove that all descriptions generated by a nontrivial grammar we define are indeed chain-connected.","Our results are interesting because it is the first time in the literature that two practically relevant underspecification formalisms are formally related to each other. In addition, the satisfi ability problems of Hole Semantics and normal dominance constraints coincide on their chain-connected fragments. This means that satisfiability of Hole Semantics, which is NP-complete in general (Althaus et al., 2003), becomes polynomial in practice, and can be checked using the efficient algorithms available for normal dominance constraints (Erk et al., 2002). Enumeration of readings becomes much more efficient accordingly."]},{"title":"2 Some Intuitions","paragraphs":["The similarity of Hole Semantics and dominance constraints is illustrated in Fig. 1. The pictures graphically represent the underspecified representations of all five readings of the sentence \"Every researcher of a company saw a sample\" in Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) and as a dominance constraint (Egg et al., 2001). The underspecified representations specify the material that every reading is made up of and constraints on the way in which they can be combined in obviously similar ways.","However, the interpretations of these underspecified representations differ. In Hole Semantics, the interpretation is given by means of pluggings, where holes (the hi ) and labels (/k) are identified. In contrast, dominance constraints are interpreted by embedding descriptions into trees that may contain more material. This difference comes 195 EA\" comp >h0< • :du.

It has no plugging in Hole Semantics, as two different things would have to be plugged into one hole, but it is satisfiable as a dominance constraint. It is this fundamental difference that restricts our result in §5, and that we avoid by using chain-connected descriptions. f a\\tb. 4 Figure 2: A description on which Hole Semantics and dominance constraints disagree. 3 Dominance Constraints Dominance constraints are a general framework for the partial description of trees. They have been used in various areas of computational linguistics (Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 1994; Gardent and Webber, 1998). For underspecified semantics, we consider semantic representations like higher-order formulas as trees.","Dominance constraints can be extended to CLLS (Egg et al., 2001), which adds parallelism constraints to model ellipsis and binding constraints to account for variable binding without using variable names. We do not use these extensions here, for simplicity, but all results remain true if we allow binding constraints. 3.1 Syntax and Semantics We assume a signature E of function symbols ranged over by f ,g, each of which is equipped with an arity ar(f) > 0, and an infinite set Vars of variables ranged over by X, Y, Z. A dominance constraint c is a conjunction of dominance, inequality, and labeling literals of the following form: ::= X < * Y XY X:f (Xi, • • • ,X01 (I) AC' where ar(f) = n.","Dominance constraints are interpreted over finite constructor trees, and their variables denote nodes of a tree. We define an unlabeled tree to be a finite directed acyclic graph (V, E), where V is the set of nodes and ECVxV the set of edges. The indegree of each node is at most 1. Each tree has exactly one node (the root) with indegree 0. Nodes with outdegree 0 are called the leaves of the tree.","A finite constructor tree T is a triple (T,Lv , LE) consisting of an unlabeled tree T = (V, E), a node labeling Lv :V —> E„ and an edge labeling LE : E N, s. t. for each node u E V there is an edge (u, v) E E with LE((U,V)) = k 1 < k < ar(Lv (u)).","Now we are ready to define tree structures, the models of dominance constraints: Definition 1 (Tree Structure).

However, Althaus et al. (2003) show that satisfiability becomes polynomial if the constraint (p is normal, i.e. satisfies the following very natural conditions:","(Ni) Every variable occurs in a labeling constraint.","(N2) Every variable occurs at most once on the right-hand side and at most once on the left-hand side of a labeling constraint. Variables that don't occur on a left-hand side are called holes; variables that don't occur on a right-hand side are called roots.","(N3) If X <1*Y occurs in (p, X is a hole and Y is a root.","(N4) If X and Y are different variables that are not holes, there is a constraint X Y in (p.","The graph of a normal constraint (e.g. the one in in Fig. 1) consists of solid tree fragments (Ni, N2) that are connected by dominance edges (N3); these fragments may not overlap in a solution (N4).","Because every satisfiable dominance constraint (p has an infinite number of solutions, algorithms typically enumerate its solved forms instead (Erk et al., 2002). A solved form is a constraint that differs from (p only in its dominance literals. Its graph must be a tree, and the reachability relation on the graph must include the reachability in the graph of (p. Every solved form of (p has a solution, and every solution of (p satisfies one of its solved forms; so we can see solved forms as representing classes of solutions that only differ in irrelevant details (e.g. unnecessary extra material).","Another way to avoid infinite solutions sets is to consider constructive solutions only. A solution PI, a) of a constraint (p is constructive if every node in M is denoted by a variable in Var((p) on the left-hand side of a labeling constraint. Intuitively, this means that the solution consists only of the material mentioned in the labeling constraints. Not all solutions are constructive; for example, Fig. 2 is a solved form but has no constructive solutions. The problem of deciding whether a normal dominance constraint does have constructive solutions is again NP-complete (Althaus et al., 2003). 4 Hole Semantics Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) is a framework that defines underspecified representations over arbitrary object languages. We use the version of (B Os, 2002) because it repairs some severe flaws in the original definition of admissible pluggings.","Hole Semantics configures formulas of an object language (such as FOL or DRT) with holes, into which other formulas can be plugged. For-mally, a formula with n holes is a complex function symbol of arity n as above. The equivalent of a dominance constraint is an underspecified representations (USR). An USR U consists of a finite set Lu of labeled formulas 1:F (h i ,... ,h0 ), where 1 is a label and F is an object-language formula with holes ,hn, and a finite set Cu of constraints. Constraints are of the form I< h, where / is a label and h a hole; this constraint means that h outscopes 1. Like for dominance constraints, there is a natural way of writing USRs as graphs (Fig. 1).","An USR U is called proper if it has the following properties: (P1) U has a unique top element, from which all","other nodes in the graph can be reached. (P2) The graph of U is acyclic. (P3) Every label and every hole except for the top","hole occurs exactly once in Lu . 1 For example, the USR shown in Fig. 1 is proper; its top element is 110 .","The solutions of underspecified representations are called admissible pluggings. A plugging is a bijection from the holes to the labels of an USR. Intuitively, we \"plug\" every hole with a formula (named by its label), and a plugging is admissible if it respects the constraints on the order of holes and labels. Definition 2 (P-domination). Let k, k' be holes or labels of some underspecified representation U, and P a plugging on U. Then k P-dominates k' iff one of the following conditions holds: 1. k : F E Lu and k' occurs in F, or 2. P(k)\\tI(' if k is a hole, or 3. There is a hole or label k\" such that k P-","dominates k\" and k\" P-dominates k'.","1 The restriction on hole occurrences is missing in (Bos, 2002), but is necessary to rule out counterintuitive USRs. 197 Definition 3 (Admissible Plugging). A plugging P is admissible for a proper USR U iff k < E Cu implies that lc' P-dominates k."]},{"title":"5 Hole Semantics as Dominance Constraints","paragraphs":["Now we have the formal machinery to make the intuitive similarity between Hole Semantics and dominance constraints described in Section 2 precise. We shall define encodings from Hole Semantics to normal dominance constraints and back, and show that this preserves models in a certain sense.","To keep things simple, the results in this sec-tions will only speak about compact normal dominance constraints. A dominance constraint is compact if no variable occurs in two different labeling constraints. A very nice property (which we need below) of compact normal constraints is that every variable is either a root or a hole. However, any normal constraint can be made compact by an operation called compactification, which compresses conjunctions of labeling constraints into single labeling constraints with more complex labels. So the encodings and results are more more generally correct for arbitrary normal dominance constraints (with acyclic graphs).","From Hole Semantics to Dominance Constraints. Assume U = (L u ,Cu ) is a proper USR. To obtain a compact dominance constraint (p u that encodes the same information, we first encode every labeled formula 1:F (hi, ... ,h) as the labeling constraint 1:F (h i , ,h,). We encode every constraint / < h in Cu as a dominance constraint h<* 1 — except if h is the unique top hole and does not occur as a hole in a labeled formula. Finally, we add a constraint / 1' for every label 1.","This encoding maps labels and holes to variables; labels end up as roots, and holes become holes. This means (p u satisfies axiom (N3). (N2) follows from (P3). (Ni) and (N4) are obvious from the construction. Hence (p u is normal.","From Dominance Constraints to Hole Semantics. Assume (p is a compact normal dominance constraint whose graph is acyclic. To obtain a proper USR UT encoding the same information, we first split the variables Var((p) into holes and labels: roots become labels, and holes become holes. Then we encode every labeling constraint X:f(Xi,...,X,i ) as the labeled formula X: f (Xi , ,X,1 ), and we encode every dominance constraint X <I' as the constraint Y < X. Finally, we add a top hole ho and a constraint / < ho for every label 1 in U.","UT is a well-defined USR because of (N3). (P1) is obvious: ho is the unique top element. The graph is acyclic because the graph of (p is acyclic, so (P2) holds. (P3) holds because every label names at least one formula by construction, and no more than one by (N2).","This back-and-forth encoding has the following property: Theorem 4.

We obtain an admissible plugging by mapping each hole h to the label P(h ) in the USR, and mapping the new top hole 1/0 to the label denoting the root of the tree."]},{"title":"6 From Solved Forms to Constructive Solutions","paragraphs":["Theorem 4 establishes a very strong connec-tion between Hole Semantics and normal dominance constraints. But it is not quite what we want: Normal dominance constraints are almost 198 always considered with respect to arbitrary solutions (or solved forms), and not constructive solutions. Constraints such as Fig. 2 are solved forms, but have no constructive solutions. The efficient algorithms available for normal constraints check for solved forms, and aren't necessarily correct for constructive satisfiability.","In this section, we establish that for normal dominance constraints which are chain-connected and leaf-labeled (to be defined below), satisfiability and constructive satisfiability are equivalent; i.e. such a constraint has a constructive solution if only it is satisfiable. The proof proceeds in three steps: First we show that all solved forms of a normal constraint are simple iff the constraint branches constructively. Then we show that if a constraint is chain-connected, it branches constructively. Finally, every simple solved form of a leaf-labeled constraint has a constructive solution. 6.1 Constructive Branching We call a solved form simple if its graph has no node with two outgoing dominance edges (i.e. Fig. 2 is not simple). This means that we can decide for any two variables how they will be situated in a solution of the solved form. They can either dominate each other in either direction, or they can be disjoint. But if they are disjoint, we also know the lowest node that dominates them both, and this branching point is necessarily also denoted by a variable on the left-hand side of a labeling constraint.","This motivates the following definition. We locally allow disjunctions of constraints and use an auxiliary constraint, the disjointness constraint X I Y at 0, where 0 is a set of variables. It is satisfied if X and Y denote disjoint nodes whose branching point is denoted by a member of 0. Definition 5. A normal dominance constraint (p branches constructively if for any two variables X ,Y E Var((p), X<*Y V Y<*X V X _L Y at L((p), where L((p) is the set of variables that occur on the left-hand side of a labeling constraint in (p. Lemma 6. Let (p be a normal dominance constraint. (p branches constructively if all solved forms of y are simple. Proof Assume first that all solved forms of (p are simple; let {(pi, , (pd- be the set of all solved forms. Now because they are simple solved forms, each (pi entails the right-hand side of Def. 5. But (p entails the disjunction of all of its solved forms, and hence branches constructively.","Conversely, assume that (p has a non-simple solved form (V. Then (p' must contain a variable X with two outgoing dominance edges (to Y and Z). But this means that (p' has a solution in which Y and Z are different children of X, and hence their lowest common ancestor is not in L((p). 6.2 Chain-Connectedness Constructive branching is a semantic property that can't conveniently be proved for a grammar. We shall now relate it to a more easily checkable property called chain-connectedness. We will first define chains, then chain-connectedness, and then prove the relation of the two concepts. Definition 7 (Fragments). A fragment in (p is a nonempty subset F C Va r((p) that is connected by labeling constraints in (p. We call the fragment maximal if it has no proper superset that is also a fragment of (p. Exactly one variable in every fragment is a root; we write R(F) for this root. Definition 8 (Chains). Let (p be a normal dominance constraint, and let F1 , , Fn (n > 1) be disjoint fragments of (p. C = (F1, ,F) is called a chain of (p iff there is a disjoint partition 0 U U = {F1 , , F„} with the following properties: 1. 0 is nonempty. 2. For each 1 < < n, either","(a) Fi E 0 and Ft+ i E U, and there is a hole","of Fi s.t.\\tXj,,,:i*R(Fi+i); or","(b) F, E U and Fi+ E 0, and there is a hole","Xi+ 1,1 of Ji s.t.\\tX,+1,/<*R(Fi). 3. For 1 < i < n s.t. Fi E 0, the holes X1,1 and","are different. 0 is called the set of upper fragments of the chain, and QI is the set of lower fragments. We call all the Xj,1 and Xi,","r connecting holes of C, and all other holes in any of its fragments open holes.","A schematic picture of a chain is shown in Fig. 3. Note that although the definition of a chain involves the rather abstract condition that dominance between to variables is entailed by the con-199 Figure 3: A schematic picture of a chain. straint, this condition can often be established syntactically — for example in Fig. 3 by the explicit dominance edges. Chains were originally introduced by Koller et al. (2000) because they have very useful structural properties. A particularly useful one is the following. Lemma 9 (Structural Properties of Chains). Let (p be a normal dominance constraint, and let C be a chain that contains all variables of (p. Let be the set of all variables in upper fragments of C that are not holes. Then if X,Y are variables in different fragments of C, the following structural property holds: X <*Y V Y <*X V X I Y at 1̀20","Using this lemma, it is easy to show that whenever a constraint is chain-connected, it also branches constructively. Definition 10. Two variables X, Y of a normal dominance constraint (p are chain-connected in (p if there is a chain C in ç that contains both X and Y. A constraint is chain-connected iff every pair of variables is chain-connected. Proposition 11. Every chain-connected dominance constraint (p branches constructively. Proof Let X, Y be two arbitrary variables in (p. If X and Y belong to the same fragment, there is obviously a connecting chain containing just this fragment. Otherwise, constructive branching for X and Y follows from Lemma 9.","For the last step of the proof, we define that a normal dominance constraint is leaf-labeled if every variable occurs on the left-hand side of a labeling or dominance literal. Such constraints have the following property: Lemma 12. Every simple solved form of a leaf-labeled constraint has a constructive solution.","Putting it all together, we obtain the intended result: Theorem 13. Every solved form of a chain-connected, leaf-labeled normal dominance constraint has a constructive solution.","We can transfer the notions of chain-connectedness and leaf-labeledness to USRs either by a direct definition or by defining that U is chain-connected or leaf-labeled iff y u is. Then we can state the following theorem: Corollary 14 (Processing of Hole Semantics). The problem whether a chain-connected, leaf-labeled proper USR has a plugging is polynomial. Proof Simply check the corresponding dominance constraint for satisfiability. Althaus et al. (2003) give a quadratic satisfiability algorithm; Thiel (2002) improves this to linear."]},{"title":"7 Connectedness in a Grammar","paragraphs":["Finally, we claim that chain-connectedness and leaf-labeledness are very weak assumptions to make about a normal dominance constraint, and conjecture that all linguistically useful constraints satisfy them. We define a nontrivial grammar for a fragment of English and show that it only generates dominance constraints with these proper-ties. The argument we use to establish chain-connectedness (the less obvious property) is fairly general, and should be applicable to other grammar fragments as well.","The grammar we use is a variant of the one presented in (Egg et al., 2001). Its syntax-semantics interface produces dominance constraints describ-ing formulas of higher-order logic; the symbol @ stands for functional application, and abstraction and variables are written as 'lam,' and v̀ar x '. We use dominance constraints because this gives us the logical tools we need in the proof; but by Theorem 4, we can translate all results back into proper USRs, and those USRs will also be chain-connected. 7.1 The Grammar The syntactic component of the grammar consists of the following phrase structure rules. 200 • [v:Np Det N] V (b9) [v:N N] Varx (bit) [v:Rc RPi S] [vs] N RC] (T) Varx Xvr„ • vary e X,;\" vary w e x; where (W, a) E Lex (b I) (b2) (b3) (b4) (b5) (b7) [vs NP VP] [v:vp IV] [v:vp TV NP] [v:vp RV NP VP] [v:vp SV S] [v:Np PN] v' @ '\"v'e• Xvr„ vf\"","@"]},{"title":"Ĉ","paragraphs":["xvr„ varx e; )q.,` Figure 4: The syntax-semantics interface (al) S\\tNP VP\\t(a8) NP Det N (a2) VP —*IV\\t(a9) N N (a3) VP TV NP\\t(a10) N —*N RC (a4) VP RV NP VP (all) RC —> RP S (a5) VP\\tSV S\\t(a13)\\tW (a7) NP\\tPN\\tif (W, oc) E Lex Most category labels are self-explanatory, perhaps except for SV, which refers to verbs taking sentence complements such as say, and RV, which refers to (object) raising verbs such as expect.","The lexicon is defined by a relation Lex relating words and lexical categories.

This resource-sensitivity was the crucial difference between the two formalisms. In the future, it will be interesting to see how our results extend to other resource-sensitive underspecification formalisms — for example, to MRS (Copestake et al., 1999), whose naive encoding into dominance constraints is less obviously normal, and which adds a more powerful outscopes relation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["H.
