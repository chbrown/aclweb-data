In addition, based on the demands of users of the automated scoring technology, tools have been developed that perform more detailed evaluations of student writing. One such application is Critique Writing Analysis Tools. Critique and erater are embedded in a broader writing instruction application, Criterion sm Online Essay Evaluation (see http://www.etstechnologies.com). Critique performs a number of evaluations on a student essay related to errors in grammar (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000), usage, and mechanics, comments on style, and analysis of essay-based discourse (organization and development) (Burstein et al, 2001 and Burstein and Marcu, 2003, and Burstein, Marcu and Knight, forthcoming).","Many of these capabilities use machine-learning approaches to model each particular kind of analysis. To develop such tools requires large sets of human annotated data, where judges have annotated information required to train a system to evaluate a particular kind of essay characteristic. For example, to build a capability to identify sentence fragments, a corpus of essay data needs to be annotated for this kind of ungrammatical sentence. A capability exists that identifies essay-based discourse elements in essays, for example, thesis statements, and conclusions. To do this, human judges annotated a corpus of essays for these particular kinds of discourse elements. Abstract Automated essay scoring is now an established capability used from elementary school through graduate school for purposes of instruction and assessment. Newer applications provide automated diagnostic feedback about student writing. Feedback includes errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics, comments about writing style, and evaluation of discourse structure. This paper reports on a system that evaluates a characteristic of lower quality essay writing style: repetitious word use. This capability is embedded in a commercial writing assessment application, Criterion sm The system uses a machine-learning approach with word-based features to model repetitious word use in an essay. System performance well exceeds several baseline algorithms. Agreement between the system and a single human judge exceeds agreement between two human judges."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Automated evaluation of student essay writing is a rapidly growing field. Over the past few years, at least four commercially automated 35 The judges' annotations were used to build an essay-based discourse analysis system.","Annotation protocols are required for each task. For identification of sentence fragments, this is reasonably straightforward. In terms of essay-based discourse analysis, it is fairly clear-cut. Though there is a certain amount of debate, annotators can be trained to have a reasonable amount of agreement in classifying essay-based discourse elements. Style, in contrast to grammar usage and discourse strategy, is tricky in terms of getting people to agree. It is a strongly subjective measure.","We discuss a system that identifies a specific characteristic of undesirable writing style --- overly repetitious word usage. Unlike identification of sentence fragments, and essay-based discourse strategy, there are no hard-and-fast rules that tell us how often a word must be used in an essay to be considered overly repetitious. The results reported in this paper indicate that even for a subjective style measure, human judges annotations can be modeled. The system can label repetitive words with precision, recall, and F-measures upwards of 0.90. It clearly outperforms all baseline methods described in the paper.","In earlier work with the writing instruction application, \"Writer's Workbench,\" some features associated with style were evaluated, including: average word length, the distribution of sentence lengths, grammatical types of sentences (e g, simple and complex), the percentage of passive voice verbs, and the percentage of nouns that are nominalizations (see MacDonald et al, 1982 for a complete description of the Writer's Workbench). In contrast to a subjective measure such as, repetitive word usage, the stylistic features in the Writer's Workbench are not subjective."]},{"title":"2 Approach","paragraphs":["essays.

With regard to word overuse in an essay, what one person may find irritating may not really bother someone else. Our goal in developing this tool was to indicate to students the cases in which word overuse might affect the rating of the paper with regard to its overall quality.","In the annotation protocol, the central guideline for the two human judges was to label as repetitious only those cases where the repetition of a word interfered with the overall quality of the essay. Both annotators were expert essay graders. They used a PC-based graphical user interface to label occurrences of repetitious words in a corpus containing 296 essays2 . These essay data were randomly selected from a larger set of 5,000 essays. The final set contained essays from across several populations (6th grade through college freshman), and 11 test question topics."]},{"title":"2.2 Decision-Based Approach","paragraphs":["We hypothesized, a priori, a number of features that could reasonably be associated with word overuse, such that the overuse interfered with a smooth reading of the essay. Our hypotheses were based on general discussions with the annotators before the annotation process began. The annotators are part of a team of experts who are critical in the decision-making process with regard to what kinds of feedback are helpful to students. We have on-going discussions with them that provide us with information about the kinds of Since we want this system to model human judgements about overly repetitious word use, two human annotators labeled a corpus of For details about this software, see http://www.ruleauest.com . 2 Practical constraints (e.g., time and costs) did not allow for additional annotation. 36 issues that they are concerned about in student essay writing. Based on our hypotheses, we found that 7 features could be used in combination to reliably predict the word(s) in a student's essay that should be labeled as repetitious. These features are described below in Figure 1.","For each lemmatized word token in an essay, a vector was generated that contained the values for the 7 features. A stoplist is used, so that function words were excluded. A decision-based machine learning algorithm, C5.0, was used to model repetitious word use, based on human judge annotations.","1) Absolute Count: Total number of occurrences.","2) Essay Ratio: Proportional occurrence of the word in the essay (based on the total number of words in the essay).","3) Paragraph Ratio: Average proportional occurrence of the word in a paragraph (based on the average number of words in all paragraphs in the essay).","4) Highest Paragraph Ratio: Proportional occurrence of the word in the paragraph where it appears with the highest frequency (based on the number of words in the paragraph where it occurs most frequently).","5) Word Length: Total number of characters in a word.","6) Is Pronoun: Is the word a pronoun?","7) Previous Occurrence Distance: The distance between the word and its previous occurrence (based on number of words.)

In Table la, \"Jl with J2\" agreement indicates that Judge 2 annotations were the basis for comparison; and, \"J2 with J1\" agreement indicates that Judge 1 annotations were the basis for comparison. The Kappa between the two judges was 0.5 based on annotations for all words (i.e., repeated + non-repeated). Kappa indicates the agreement between judges with regard to chance agreement (Uebersax, 1982). Research in content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980) suggests that Kappa values higher than 0.8 reflect very high agreement, between 0.6 and 0.8 indicate good agreement, and values between 0.4 and 0.6 show lower agreement, but still greater than chance.","Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix show annotated essays by each judge.

How can we build a system to reliably identify overly repetitious words if judges cannot agree? If we look in the total set of essays identified by either judge as having some repetition, we find an overlapping set of 40 essays where both judges annotated the essay as having some sort of repetition. We call this the agreement subset.","Of the essays that Judge I annotated as having repetition, approximately 57% (40/70) agreed with Judge 2 as having some sort of repetition; of the essays that Judge 2 annotated with repetitious word use, about 54% (40/74) agreed with Judge 1. If we look at the total number of \"Repeated words\" labeled by each judge for all essays in Table la, we find that these 40 essays contain the majority of \"Repeated words\" for each judge: 64% (838/1315) for Judge 2, and 60% (767/1292) for Judge 1.","It is possible that even for the essays where judges both agree that there is some kind of repetitive word use, they do not agree on what the repetition is. Therefore, we want to answer the following question: On the subset of essays where judges agree that there is repetition, do they agree on the same words as being repetitious?","The core agreement with regard to \"Repeated words\" appears to be in these 40 essays. Table lb shows high agreement between the two judges for \"Repeated words\" in the agreement subset.

Each baseline system uses one of the 7 word-based features used to select repetitious words (see Figure 1). Baseline systems label all occurrences of a word as repetitious if the criterion value for the algorithm is met. After several iterations using different values, the final criterion value (V) is the one that yielded the highest performance. The final criterion value is shown in Table 2. Precision, Recall, and F-measures are based on comparisons with the same sets of essays and words from Table la. Comparisons between Judge 1 with each baseline algorithm are based on the 74 essays where Judge 1 annotated repetitious words, and likewise, for Judge 2, on this judge's 70 essays annotated for repetitious words.","Using the baseline algorithms in Table 2, the F-measures for non-repeated words range from 0.96 to 0.97, and from 0.93 to 0.94 for all words (i.e., repeated + non-repeated words). The exceptional case is for Highest Paragraph Ratio Algorithm with Judge 2, where the F-measure for non- repeated words is 0.89, and for all words is 0.82. 38","To evaluate the system in comparison to each of the human judges, for each feature combination algorithm, a 10-fold cross-validation was run on each set of annotations for both judges. For each cross-validation run, a unique nine-tenths of the data were used for training, and the remaining one-tenth was used for cross-validating that model. Based on this evaluation, Table 3, shows agreement at the word level between each judge and a system that uses a different combination of features. Agreement refers to the mean agreement across the 10-fold cross-validation runs.","All systems clearly exceed the performance of the 7 baseline algorithms in Table 2. The best system is All Features, in which all 7 features are used. These results are indicated in italicized boldface in Table 3. It also indicates that building a model using the annotated sample from human judges 1 or 2 yielded indistinguishable results.

It seems that the machine learning algorithm is capturing the patterns of repetitious word use in that set of 40 essays. Perhaps, an additional explanation as to why each judge has high agreement with the system, is that each judge is internally consistent. 4 Discussion and Conclusions Teachers would generally prefer that students try to use synonyms in their writing, instead of the same word, repeatedly. Feedback about word overuse is helpful in terms of getting students to refine the use of vocabulary in their writing. Therefore, writing teachers would agree that it is an important capability in an automated essay evaluation system.","The evaluations presented in this paper show that a reliable repetitive word detection system can be built to model human annotations, even though this is a highly subjective writing style measure. An evaluation of our system indicates that it outperforms all baseline systems. It also has agreement with a single judge upward of 0.90 with regard to Precision, Recall and F-measures.","As research continues in automated essay scoring, it is standard to try to incorporate in a scoring system, any new features of writing that can be captured automatically. This new capability to identify repetitious word usage is currently being evaluated in terms of how it can contribute to better accuracy in an automated scoring system. Preliminary results indicate that the ability to detect if a writer is overusing certain vocabulary can contribute to the overall accuracy of the score from an automated essay scoring system. We are experimenting with the information about repetitious word usage in different discourse elements in an essay, e.g., thesis statements. In this case, the detection of repetitious words in these elements could contribute to a method for rating the overall quality of a particular element.","The repetitious word detection system was trained on annotated data across 11 test question topics; however, informal evaluations indicate that the system makes reasonable decisions on any topic. Though more systematic testing still needs to be done, the system appears to be topicindependent. 5 Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Claudia Leacock for advice on earlier versions of this paper.

Figure 3: Sample Annotated Essay from Judge 2 Which Judge 1 Did Not Identify One major SCHOOL issue that we students face daily is the subject of SCHOOL safety. Many SCHOOLS across the country have encountered SCHOOL VIOLENCE. I think that most SCHOOL VIOLENCE starts with the SCHOOL and the community. Students who engage in SCHOOL VIOLENCE are usually made fun of or are insecure about themselves. Some ways that I think that we can stop SCHOOL follow. I think that in order to stop SCHOOL VIOLENCE in and around our communities we have to get the community involved in sharing and making it aware to other cities and towns that SCHOOL VIOLENCE is very real, and we face it everyday. One way I think that we can cut down on SCHOOL VIOLENCE is to have striter disapline policies. When students in a SCHOOL joke around or threaten other students about killing them, or bringing weapons to SCHOOL, the staff of that SCHOOL needs to take action. When a student has thought out a plan to kill others, they obviously need to be talked to. I hope that by reading these ways to stop SCHOOL VIOLENCE we can all take action to make our SCHOOLS safer. We can not stop SCHOOL VIOLENCE until we stop blaming others, and see that we too have overlooked SCHOOL VIOLENCE. SCHOOL VIOLENCE is a major SCHOOL issue that everyone can stop, if we all try to help. Figure 4: Sample Essay Where Both Judges Agree On Repeated Words 42"]}]}
