It has been in development at the University of Sheffield since 1995, and has been used for many R&D projects, including Information Extraction in multiple languages and media, and for multiple tasks and clients. GATE is available freely, as an open source system, under the GNU library licence, and has been downloaded by around 2500 sites worldwide. The core architecture and some applications developed within GATE have been previously demonstrated (Cunningham et al., 2002); however, this demonstration will focus on the multilingual aspects of GATE, and adaptations of its IE system for different languages.","Version 2 of GATE has a large number of added features from the previous version, such as:","• comprehensive multilingual support via Unicode","'This work has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grants GR/K25267 and GR/M31699, and by several smaller grants. • tools for performance evaluation • support for manual annotation • reusable visualisation components • database support (Oracle, PostgresQL)","• support for distributed resources from the Web","• comprehensive document format support (SGML, XML, HTML, RDF, email, plain text) Figure 1: Unicode text in Gate2"]},{"title":"2 Processing Resources","paragraphs":["GATE provides a baseline set of reusable and extendable language processing components for common NLP tasks, known collectively as ANNIE (A Nearly New Information Extraction System).

A Unicode enabled graphical user interface (GUI) needs to address two main issues: the capability to display text and the ability to enter text in other languages than the default one.","It also provides a means of entering text in a variety of languages and scripts, using virtual keyboards where the language is not supported by the underlying operating platform (Java it-self does not support input in many languages covered by Unicode, although it supports Unicode representation). Figure 1 depicts text in various scripts displayed in GATE. The facilities have been developed as part of the EMILLE project (Baker et al., 2002), designed to construct a 63 million word corpus of South Asian languages. There are currently 28 languages supported in GATE, and more are planned for the future. Since GATE is an open architecture, new virtual keyboards can easily be defined by users and added to the system.","Apart from the input methods, GUK also provides a simple Unicode-aware text editor which is important because not all platforms provide one by default or the users may not know which one of the already installed editors is Unicode-aware. Besides providing text visualisation and editing facilities, the GUK editor also performs encoding conversion operations. The editor has proved a useful tool during the development and testing of GATE in a cross-platform environment, while the ability to handle Unicode enables applications developed within GATE to be easily ported to new languages."]},{"title":"4 The future isn't English","paragraphs":["Robust tools for multilingual information extraction are becoming increasingly sought after now that we have capabilities for processing texts in different languages and scripts. While the default IE system is English-specific, some of the modules can be reused directly (e.g. the Unicode-based tokeniser can handle Indo-European languages), and/or easily customised for new languages (Pastra et al., 2002). So far, ANNIE has been adapted to do IE in Bulgarian, Romanian, Bengali, Greek, Spanish, Swedish, German, Italian, and French, and we are currently porting it to Arabic, Chinese and Russian, as part of the MUSE project 2 . Figure 3: Romanian news text annotated in GATE 4.1 NE in Slavonic languages The Bulgarian NE recogniser (Paskaleva et al., 2(02) was built using three main processing resources: a tokeniser, a gazetteer and a semantic grammar built using JAPE. There was no POS tagger available in Bulgarian, and consequently we had no need of a sentence splitter either. The main changes to the system were in terms 2http://www.des.shefac.uk/research/groups/n1p/muse/ 220","al Gate","17-1111 Applications - ej, BG system","CI.\\t Language Resources = A Text EiG Processing Resources BG Names t\" . ■ Unicode Tokeniser =\\t BG Gazetteer","g Data stores Messages I di BO system\\tText BO"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["Emol-apgslee aerompe 8 METO4HEI EBFIOna AHM,I9 e H8 crepes reproahuln m chpaagnn ca e Sanagaa Espana.","tR-","I'M K IHNHI",".","X8M 30 Mavr 2000\\t — Dr M Cunningham Dr."]},{"title":"M","paragraphs":["Cunningham D-rAHrenoaa Type •","Set Stag End","Features Lookup ,Default, 71 78 trninorType=country, majorType=location} Lookup ,Default> 60 68","trninorType=country, majorType=location} Lookup ,Default> 37 43","trninorType=country, majorType=location} Lookup ,Default> 0 8 trninorType=country, majorType=location} Person ,Default> 210 216 tkInd=personName, rule=KallnaPersonl Person ,Default> 173 179 tkInd=personName, rule=HamishPerson} Person ,Default> 148 154","tkInd=personName, rule=HamishPerson} Person ,Default> 108 113","tkind=personName, rule.HamishPersonBet Person ,Default> 266 270 tkind=personName, rule=GaliaPersont Person ,Default> 248 253 tkind=personName, rule=GaliaPersont Person ,Default> 230 236 tkind=personName, rule=KalinaPersonl","E <Default> 1—T7 Lookup F SpaceToken DA Gate 2.0alphal File Edit Tools Help Figure 2: Bulgarian named entities in GATE of the gazetteer lists (e.g. lists of first names, days of the week, locations etc. were tailored for Bulgarian), and in terms of some of the pattern matching rules in the grammar. For example, Bulgarian makes far more use of morphology than English does, e.g. 91% of Bulgarian surnames could be directly recognised using morphological information. The lack of a POS tagger meant that many rules had to be specified in terms of orthographic features rather than parts of speech. Figure 2 shows some Bulgarian text annotated in GATE.","Since the structure of the Bulgarian and Russian languages is quite similar, we anticipate that converting the Bulgarian system to Russian will be fairly straightforward, and will involve mostly replacing and/or updating gazetteer lists at least to obtain comparable results. 4.2 NE in Romanian The Romanian NE recogniser (Hamza et al. ; 2002) was developed from ANNIE in a similar way to the Bulgarian one, using a tokeniser, gazetteer and a JAPE semantic grammar. Figure 3 shows some Romanian text annotated in GATE.","Romanian is a more flexible language than English in terms of word order; it is also agglutinative e.g. definite articles attach to nouns, making a definite and indefinite form of both common and proper nouns.","As with Bulgarian, the tokeniser did not need to be modified, while the gazetteer lists and grammar rules needed some changes ;","most of which were fairly minor. For both Bulgarian and Romanian, the modifications necessary were easily implemented by a native speaker who did not require any other specialist skills beyond a basic grasp of the JAPE language and the GATE architecture. No Java skills or other programming knowledge was necessary. The Gate Unicode kit was invaluable in enabling the preservation of the diacritics in Romanian, by saving them with UTF-8 encoding. 4.3 NE in other languages ANNIE has also been adapted to perform NE recognition on English, French and German dialogues in the AMITIES project 3 , a screenshot of which is shown in Figure 4. Since French and German are more similar to English in many ways than e.g. Slavonic languages, it was very easy to adapt the gazetteers and grammars accordingly. 3 http://www.dcs.shcf.ac.uk/nlp/amitics 221","M ArruChat","\\t","7EIEF","File AMITIES: Amities, how can I help, je vous ecoute, was lcann ich ftir Sie tun?

Figure 4: AMITIES multilingual dialogue 4.4 Surprise languages We are currently investigating methods of adapting ANNIE to new languages with the minimum of resources and time. Our previous experiments with languages other than English have demonstrated that we can get reasonable results in around 2 person months using a native speaker and hand-coded semantic tagging rules, without requiring resources such as dictionaries or POS taggers for that language. We are also planning participation in the TIDES-based \"surprise language experiment\", which requires various NLP tasks such as IE, IR, summarisation and MT to be carried out in a month on a surprise language, the nature of which will not be known in advance. The open and flexible architecture of GATE, and the separation of linguistic data from processing makes it an ideal environment within which to perform such a task. Any available linguistic resources such as dictionaries and POS taggers can be simply plugged into the model, but if these are not available we can simply modify other components as necessary."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this demo we have shown how an existing set of IE tools has been modified to a diverse set of languages with minimum overhead. The advantage of having such low-overhead portability is that it enables quick deployment of IE tools with acceptable performance, which, even if not developed in end-used applications ;","can be used to bootstrap the creation of IE-annotated corpora and/or facilitate the training of learning tools for adaptive IE. In addition, some adaptive IE tools are now using the ANNIE cornponents to provide them with richer linguistic information (Ciravegna et al., 2002)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P.
