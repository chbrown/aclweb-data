This research was done within the framework of a European ESPRIT project (LTR 20237, \"lLP2\"), where first studies were based on the so-called TELRI corpus (Erjavec et al., 1998). Since the corpus annotation had several deficiencies and its size proved to be small for further research, a national project has been or-ganized with the main goal to create a suitably large training corpus for machine learning applications, primarily for POS (Part-of-speech) tagging.","PUS tagging plays a central role in NLP (natural language processing). Hungarian words — similarly to other languages — may have more than one part-of-speech labels (e.g. the word"]},{"title":"eg","paragraphs":["may be a noun or a verb)! In many natural language processing software systems, including web-based dictionaries and optical character recognition programs, determining the part-of-kg is an ambiguous word in Hungarian, it corresponds either to sky (noun) or to burn (verb) in English."]},{"title":"Abstract","paragraphs":["Current paper presents the results of a two-year project during which a consortium of the University of Szeged and the MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest developed a morpho-syntactically parsed and annotated (disambiguated) corpus for Hungarian. For morpho-syntactic encoding, the Hungarian version of MSD (Morpho-Syntactic Description) has been used. The corpus contains texts of five different topic areas: schoolchildren's compositions, fiction, computer-related texts, news, and legal texts. During annotation, linguists have checked the morpho-syntactic parsing of each word. Finding part-of-speech tagging (disambiguation) rules by machine learning algorithms was also studied by the researchers of the consortium. Due to the fact that the size of the corpus reaches up to 1 million text words without punctuation characters, it may serve as a reference source for numerous future research applications. The corpus can be obtained freely via Internet for research and educational purposes. 53 speech tag of a particular word in a given context is significant. Syntactic and semantic parsing of natural language sentences are greatly influenced by adequate part-of-speech tagging. In their preliminary studies, the consortium members found that ambiguous words are very frequent in Hungarian language. Hence, developing an annotation (disambiguation) technology proved to be a real necessity.","When choosing the form of representation of the corpus it was taken into consideration that it should comply with international standards. Therefore, the tag encoding system of the annotated Hungarian corpus was based on a technology (MSD) that has already been applied to other — mainly European — languages. 2 Preliminaries Collecting special text corpora in Hungary has already begun in the eighties. These texts have been thematically grouped, but were not analyzed morpho-syntactically. The development of the morphological parser Humor (High-speed Unification Morphology) began in the early nineties (PrOszeky and Kis, 1999). In the framework of the Copernicus project 106 \"MULTEXT-EAST\" between 1995 and 1997, the participants created an augmented morpho-syntactic coding scheme, called MSD (Erjavec et al., 1997) to be applicable to Central and East European languages. To demonstrate the behavior of this coding technique, a parallel annotated corpus was developed based on Orwell's novel, \"1984\". Part-of-speech tagging of this corpus was completed manually by linguists. It is widely known as TELRI corpus and published on a CD-ROM (Erjavec et al., 1998). For automatic generation of morpho-syntactic labels for the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus the above-mentioned Humor system was used.","Unfortunately, the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus did not implement the whole encoding scheme; more precisely, it did not classify the pronouns, numerals, adverbs, and conjunctions. For example, all pronouns got the same [P] tag, without any attributes encoded. Other at-tempts for making a Hungarian annotated corpus was not known before the presently described project was started in 2000. A comparison of the manually annotated Hungarian corpus and the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus can be seen in Table 1.

Comparing the main features of the","manually annotated Hungarian corpus and","the TELRI corpus","Using the TELRI corpus Horvath, Alexin, GyimOthy, and Wrobel, (1999) investigated the applicability of several machine learning algorithms for learning part-of-speech tagging rules for Hungarian. The manually annotated Hungarian corpus can significantly enlarge the learning database for applying similar methods.","In section 3 the main feature of the corpus is presented, in section 4 more statistical data and two connecting projects is presented. Section 5 summarizes the main achievements of the work. 3 Manually Annotated Hungarian Corpus Participants of the project aimed not only to in-crease the amount of corpus text up to 1 million text words, but to improve the quality of the annotation as well. By quality we mean both full conformity to the MSD coding scheme and accurate manual morpho-syntactic parsing and tagging. The parts of the 1-million-word corpus were selected and put together by the project partners. Naturally, a corpus of this size could not cover the whole written language, but the consortium tried to mainly include most recent texts, well representing the major types available through the Internet, including the special language used by the youth — the primary users of the Internet. Based on this idea, the consortium decided to gather texts belonging to five different topic areas listed below. Parts of the corpus belonging to 54 each topic area contains roughly 200 000 words respectively.","• Schoolchildren's compositions. This material was collected from pupils of the age 16 (grade 10). They were asked to write two one-pagelong compositions with the titles The most in-teresting day of my life and Why do/don't I like school? This type of text caused lot of headaches for the consortium, because it contained many misspelled, mistyped or incorrectly written words — a phenomenon that occurs frequently in Internet texts as well.","• Fiction. Three novels were included in the corpus, one of which was the Hungarian transla-tion of Orwell's 1984 and two more Hungarian novels. The first has been completely re-parsed and re-annotated.","• Computer-related texts. Some issues of ComputerWorld SzcimItcistechnika magazine and three chapters from a book about Windows 2000 were selected.","• News. One complete issue each from 1999 of four well-known Hungarian newspapers (Magyar Hirlap, Nepszabadscig, Nepszava and HVG)","• Legal texts. Two complete Acts (Act on economic companies, Act on authors' rights) were included in the corpus.","The developed corpus is available in XML 2 format. The inner structure of the files is described in TEIXLITE DTD (Document Type Definition). 3 This \"light\" version of the TEI XML DTD is widely used for corpus representations.","The text of the corpus has been divided into divisions between <div> and </div> tags), where one division comprised a single composition, a newspaper article, etc.; paragraphs (marked by <p> and </p> tags); and sentences (between <s> and </s> tags). Each structural element is uniquely identified by an id attribute. Text words are marked by <w> and </w>, punctuation characters marked by <c> and </c> tags. Some statistical data can be seen in Table 2.","The next step of processing was morpho-syntactic parsing. Preliminary steps were executed by a segmenting tool and the HuMor mor-2 http://wvixiii.xml.org .3 The TE1 consortium http://www.tei-c.org is an international organization that elaborates guidelines for computer text representations. pho-syntactic parser. A lexicon has been built that contained all of the 163 000 different word-forms and a 15 000-word-long list of named entities, mainly proper nouns occurring in the corpus. Either since HuMor could not produce some of the attributes needed for MSD encoding or because the results of this automatic tool were sometimes incorrect, linguists had to manually check the lexicon and create a relatively large list of exceptions. Most of this work was based on the Hungarian Explanatory Dictionary (Juhasz, SzOke, Nagy, and Kovalovszky, 1972), however annotators had to rely on their intuition in a large number of neologies. Finally, the whole text was re-parsed using the created exception dictionary. Tags Number of tags <div> 3365","<p> 17 144","<s> 68 932 <w> words 1 009 024","<c> punctuations 203 005","Table 2.

Annotators worked on 400-500-sentence-long pieces of the corpus. Senior linguists and computer programs checked the quality of their work. Producing a POS tagger prototype was among the final goals of the project."]},{"title":"4 Discussion","paragraphs":["The development of the first version of the corpus was finished in summer of 2002. Since then two major projects have been started using the described corpus. Each of which aims to add new features to the existing material.","The goal of the first project is to create an in-formation extraction system from short business news. To accomplish this, participants augment the manually annotated Hungarian corpus with a 200 000-word-long part containing short business news. Moreover, a newer version of the corpus is created containing partial syntactic parsing namely, hierarchic NP annotations. During this project, the participants extensively use tools for determining syntax rules and machine learning techniques. The goal of the second project is to 55 create a complete treebank for Hungarian by the end of 2004.","The distribution of words' main categories occurring in the manually annotated Hungarian corpus is shown in Table 3.","Category Number of words","count % Adjectives 130727 10.79% Conjunctions 86531 7.14% Interjection 1856 0.15% Numerals 29802 2.46% Nouns 281811 23.25% Pronouns 60833 5.02% Adverbs 116410 9.60% Suffixes 16096 1.33% Articles 129680 10.70% Verbs 141231 11.65% Unknown 9605 0.79% Abbreviation 1370 0.11% Mistyped 3071 0.25% All text words 1009023 83.25% Punctuations 203006 16.75% All tokens 1212029 100.00%","Table 3.
