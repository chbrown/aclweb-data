We introduce a family of feature ranking functions for feature selection in the multinomial event model that take account of the word frequency information. We present evaluation results on two publicly available corpora of legitimate and spam E-mails.

Text categorization plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) applications. One particular application of text categorization is anti-spam E-mail filtering, where the goal is to block unsolicited messages with commercial or pornographic content (UCE, spam) from a user's E-mail stream, while letting other (legitimate) messages pass. Here, the task is to assign a message to one of two categories, legitimate and spam, based on the message's content.","In recent years, a growing body of research has applied machine learning techniques to text categorization and (anti-spam) E-mail filtering, in-cluding rule learning (Cohen, 1996), Naive Bayes (Sahami et al., 1998; Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b; Rennie, 2000), memory based learning (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b), decision trees (Carreras and Marquez, 2001), support vector machines (Drucker et al., 1999) or combinations of different learners (Sakkis et al., 2001). In these approaches a classifier is learned from training data rather than constructed by hand, which results in better and more robust classifiers.","The Naive Bayes classifier has been found particularly attractive for the task of text categorization because it performs surprisingly well in many application areas despite its simplicity (Lewis, 1998). Bayesian classifiers are based on a probabilistic model of text generation. A text is generated by first choosing a class according to some prior probability and then generating a text according to a class-specific distribution. The model parameters are estimated from training examples that have been annotated with their correct class. Given a new document, the classifier outputs the class which is most likely to have generated the document.","From a linguistic point of view, a document is made up of words, and the semantics of the document is determined by the meaning of the words and the linguistic structure of the document. The Naive Bayesian classifier makes the simplifying assumption that the probability that a document is generated in some class depends only on the probabilities of the words given the context of the class, and that the words in a document are independent of each other. This is called the Naive Bayes assumption.","The generative model underlying the Naive Bayes classifier can be characterized with respect to the amount of information it captures about the 307 words in a document. In information retrieval and text categorization, two types of models have been used (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). Both assume that there is a fixed vocabulary. In the first model, a document is generated by first choosing a subset of the vocabulary and then using the selected words any number of times, at least once, in any order. This model is called multi-variate Bernoulli model. It captures the information of which words are used in a document, but not the number of times each words is used, nor the order of the words in the document.","In the second model, a document is generated by choosing a set of word occurrences and arrang-ing them in any order. This model is called multinomial model. In addition to the multi-variate Bernoulli model, it also captures the information about how many times a word is used in a document. Note that in both models, a document can contain additional words that are not in the vocabulary, which are considered noise and are not used for classification.","Despite the fact that the multi-variate Bernoulli model captures less information about a document (compared to the multinomial model), it performs quite well in text categorization tasks, particularly when the set of words used for classification is small. However, McCallum and Nigam (1998) have shown that the multinomial model outperforms the multi-variate Bernoulli model on larger vocabulary sizes or when the vocabulary size is chosen optimal for both models.","Most text categorization approaches to anti-spam E-mail filtering have used the multi-variate Bernoulli model (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b). Rennie (2000) used a multinomial model but did not compare it to the multi-variate model. Mladenia and Grobelnik (1999) used a multinomial model in a different context. In this paper we present results of experiments in which we evalu-ated the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier on two publicly available E-mail corpora, using both the multi-variate Bernoulli and the multinomial model.","The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the Naive Bayes classifier and the two generative models in more detail. In Sect. 3 we introduce feature selection methods that take into account the extra information contained in the multinomial model. In Sect. 4 we describe our experiments and discuss the results. Finally, in Sect. 5 we draw some conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Naive Bayes Classifier","paragraphs":["We follow the description of the Naive Bayes classifier given in McCallum and Nigam (1998). A Bayesian classifier assumes that a document is generated by a mixture model with parameters 0, consisting of components C = {ci, cm } that correspond to the classes. A document is generated by first selecting a component c3 E C according to the prior distribution P(c3 18) and then choosing a document di according to the parameters of c3 with distribution P(di lc3 ; 0).

Following McCallum and Nigam (1998) and Androutsopoulos et al. (2000b), we ranked the words according to their average mutual information with the class variable and selected the N highest ranked words. Average mutual information between a word wt and the class variable, denoted by M/(C; W1 ), is the difference between the entropy of the class variable, H(C), and the entropy of the class variable given the information about the word, H(CI Wt ) (Cover and Thomas, 1991). Intuitively, M/(C: VV) measures how much bandwidth can be saved in the transmission of a class value when the information about the word is known.","In the multi-variate Bernoulli model, Wt is a random variable that takes on values ft E {0, 1}, indicating whether word w t occurs in a document or not.

For example, the token Subject : appears in every document in the two corpora we used in our experiments exactly once, and thus is completely uninformative. mv-M/ assigns 0 to this token, but mn-MI yields a positive value because the average document length in the classes is different, and thus the class-conditional probabilities of the token are different across classes in the multinomial model. On the other hand, assume that some token occurs once in every document in el and twice in every document in e2, and that the average document length in c2 is twice the average document length in e l . Then both mv-M/ and mn-MI will assign 0 to the token, although it is clearly highly informative in the multinomial model.

Following (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b), we used 10-fold crossvalidation in all experiments, using nine parts for training and the remaining part for testing, with a different test set in each trial. The evaluation measures were then averaged across the 10 iterations.","We performed experiments on each of the corpora, using the multi-variate Bernoulli model with my-MI, as well as the multinomial model with my-MI and the feature ranking functions in Table 1, and varying the number of selected words from 50 to 5000 by 50. 4.2 Results For each event model and feature ranking function, we determined the minimum number of words with highest recall for which recall equaled precision (breakeven point). Tables 2 and 3 present the breakeven points with the number of selected words, recall in each class, and accuracy. In some cases, precision and recall were different over the entire range of the number of selected words. In these cases we give the recall and accuracy for the minimum number of words for which accuracy was highest.","Figures 1 and 2 show recall curves for the multi-variate Bernoulli model and three feature ranking functions in the multinomial model for Ling-Spam, and Figures 3 and 4 for PU I .","Some observations can be made from these results. First, the multi-variate Bernoulli model favors the Ling resp. Legit classes over the Spam classes, whereas the multinomial model is more balanced in conjunction with mv-MI, tf-MI and tftf-MI. This may be due to the relatively specific vocabulary used especially in the Ling-Spam corpus, and to the uneven distribution of the documents in the classes. Second, the multinomial model achieves higher accuracy than the multi-variate Bernoulli model. tf-MI even achieves high accuracy at a comparatively small vocabulary size (1200 and 2400 words, respectively). In general, PU1 seems to be more difficult to classify.","Androutsopoulos et al. (2000b) used cost-sensitive evaluation metrics to account for the fact that it may be more serious an error when a legitimate message is classified as spam than vice versa. However, such cost-sensitive measures are problematic with a Naive Bayes classifier because the probabilities computed by Naive Bayes are not reliable, due to the independence assumptions it makes. Therefore we did not use cost-sensitive measures. 4"]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We performed experiments with two different statistical event models (a multi-variate Bernoulli","4Despite this, Naive Bayes can be an optimal classifier because it uses only the ranking implied by the probabilities, not the probabilities themselves (Dorningos and Pazzani, 1997). 311","- 1 \\t","tftf-MI \\t \\t Multi-variate B ernoulli\\t\\t I\"I / \\t- / Name Vocabulary size Ling Spain Accuracy Bernoulli 3900 99.88 88.57 98.00 mv-MI 1050 99.34 96.47 98.86 mn-MI 200 98.92 93.76 98.06 dmn-MI 500 99.21 16.84 85.52 if-MI 1200 99.34 96.05 98.79 dtf-MI 200 99.09 95.43 98.48 W-1141 4550 99.30 96.26 98.79 Table 2: Precision/recall breakeven points for Ling-Spam.

We used several feature ranking functions for feature selection in the multinomial model that explicitly take into account the word frequency information contained in the multinomial document representation. The main conclusion we draw from these experiments is that the multinomial model is less biased towards one class and can achieve higher accuracy than the multi-variate Bernoulli model, in particular when frequency information is taken into account also in the feature selection process.","Our plans for future work are to evaluate the feature selection functions for the multinomial model introduced in this paper on other corpora, and to provide a better theoretical foundation for these functions. Most studies on feature selection have concentrated on the multi-variate Bernoulli model (Yang and Pedersen, 1997). We believe that the information contained in the multinomial document representation has been neglected in previous studies, and that the development of feature selection functions especially for the multinomial model could improve its performance."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ion Androutsopoulos, John Koutsias, Konstantinos V.
