Our studies suggest that summarization is a communicative task that requires data analysis techniques for determining the content of the summary. We describe a prototype system that summarizes physiological time series."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Time series data is ubiquitous — any measurement humans make over a period of time produces a time series. We are building a system to summarize physiological times series data such as heart rate, and blood pressure measured in neonatal intensive care units."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["The SumTimE project aims to develop generic techniques to produce textual summaries of time series data (Sripada et al, 2001). We initially worked in two domains, meteorology and gas turbines. In meteorology we generate textual weather forecasts from weather data such as wind speed, wind direction, and wave heights. In gas turbines we generate textual summaries of unexpected patterns in sensor data such as exhaust temperature, liquid fuel flow, and turbine speed. In each of these domains we are working with industrial collaborators and have built prototype systems.","Using the experience from both these domains we have now started working on physiological time series data in collaboration with NEONATE (Ewing et al, 2002) project. The main objective of NEONATE has been to produce a decision support system for the medical personnel working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).","In the NEONATE project, a research nurse has been employed to collect data from the neonatal intensive care unit at Simpson Maternity Hospital, Edinburgh using a software tool, BabyWatch (Ewing et al, 2002). Physiological parameters such as heart rate, mean blood pressure and temperature are recorded at one-second frequency using various probes attached to the baby.","In order to monitor the health of babies, medical personnel (doctors and nurses) working in the neonatal unit are required to inspect such data continually. Currently they use visual displays of the data. Our system"]},{"title":"will","paragraphs":["generate textual summaries of these data as an aid to the medical personnel. We believe that interpreting textual summaries is lot quicker and does not require much mathematical (statistical) knowledge when compared to interpreting graphical displays."]},{"title":"3 Knowledge Acquisition","paragraphs":["We have carried out a variety of knowledge acquisition (KA) activities using multiple techniques developed in the expert system community (Scott, Clayton, and Gibson, 1991) to understand how humans perform data summarization. 167 20.0 60.0 BM(RD) 27 Feb 96 03:00\\t03 10\\t03 20\\t0333\\t3343\\t03:50\\t04:00\\t04:10\\t04:20\\t04:30\\t04:40\\t04:50\\t05 00\\t0510\\t3520\\t3530\\t05:40\\t05:50 Figure 1. Plot of mean blood pressure","Figure 1 shows a time series plot of mean blood pressure sampled every second for three hours. Figure 2 shows its summary extracted from a small corpus of human written summaries we analyzed. The summary text in Figure 2 has the doctor's interpretation of the data (for in-stance, .... this is an inadequate blood pressure ....' and .̀. and I suspect that dopamine has been started ...') interwoven with pure data description (for instance, '...BP is fairly stable at round about 30kpa '). On the BP trace the BP is fairly stable at round about 30kpa until 04:20 with the exception of the blood sampling artifact at just about 04:08. This is an inadequate blood pressure and has fallen further at 04:20 and I suspect that dopamine has been started at this point because from about 04:23 there is a steady increase in the BP until 04:50 when the BP is now 40. This is much more adequate. There are in some oscillations presumably as the infusion rate of dopamine has been turned down until the BP settles down to round about 34. Figure 2. Human written summary for the data shown in Figure 1.","Based on our KA studies we have made a number of observations about neonatal data summarization. A few of them are:","• Raw data contains a number of artifacts due to external events such as baby handling and blood sampling. These artifacts need to be separated from the input data before summarizing. The example data shown in Figure 1, contains one blood sampling artifact at 4:08.","• Summaries should report rises and falls in the data.","• Summaries should report actual numerical values of the parameter being summarized.","Artifact separation was not required in the other two domains; it was unique to neonatal data. One of the experts, with whom we did KA explained that physiological data without artifacts reflect the true physiology of the underlying baby. He explained further that artifact data could be interesting in its own right if summarized separately because such summaries show how the underlying baby is reacting to the external ac-tions.","Interestingly, we have made some general observations about data summarization across all the three domains.","• Summarization needs some domain knowledge reflecting how data will be used. In the domain of neonatal care it is in the form of knowledge about artifacts. In the domain of meteorology it is in the form of knowledge of what is important. For example, changes in wind speeds and direc-tions are important in marine forecasts but not in public forecasts unless gales are predicted. Finally in the domain of gas turbine it is in the form of important patterns. For instance, damped oscillations and steps are significant for monitoring turbines.","• This knowledge, however, can be integrated into standard data analysis algo-168 Artefact Separation Doe.- planning Micro-planning Inp Data rithms. In the domain of meteorology user thresholds have been used for determining stopping criterion for segmentation. In the domain of gas turbines domain knowledge has been used for classifying patterns."]},{"title":"4 System Architecture","paragraphs":["Our system follows the pipeline architecture for text generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000) as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Architecture of our summarization system","The first module, artifact separation is responsible for detecting and removing artifacts due to external activities such as blood sampling and baby handling. Artifact detection in a signal deserves a separate study in its own right. However, in SumTimE we are initially using a median filter and an impossible value filter developed in our collaborator project NEONATE.","Document planning is responsible for selecting the 'important' data points from the input data and to organize them into a paragraph. We describe this module in greater detail in 4.1. The third module, micro planning is responsible for lexical selection and aggregation. Finally the fourth module, realization is responsible for generating the grammatical output. We have used the small corpus we collected from NEONATE, to build the micro planner and realizer."]},{"title":"4.1 Content Selection and Segmentation","paragraphs":["The most important question in summarization is 'what data points from the input should be in-cluded in the summary 9 ' Any model of summarization needs to find ways to reduce the size of the input data set (or improve its accessibility) without significantly altering its content (or informativeness). This process is sensitive to the domain constraints such as limits on parameter values. It is clear from our own studies on data summarization and also from the earlier studies by others (Shahar, 1997; Boyd, 1998; Kulkich, 1983) that data summarization needs data analysis to determine the trends and patterns present in the data set. RESUME (Shahar, 1997) uses knowledge based temporal abstraction for producing abstractions of clinical data. TREND (Boyd, 1998) uses wavelets to analyze archives of weather data to produce weather summaries. ANA (Kulkich, 1983) uses a combination of arithmetic computa-tions and pattern matching techniques to analyse raw data from the Dow Jones News service data-base. SUMTIME-MOUSAM (Sripada et al, 2002) used segmentation of input weather data to determine intervals with similar trends.","Upon manual inspection of corpus texts we felt that segmentation should work with neonatal data. Segmentation is the process of fitting linear segments to an input data series keeping the maximum error introduced in segments to be lower than the user defined value. There are many algorithms for segmentation developed in the KDD community. These algorithms differ from each other in the control information they use and the way they process data (such as top-down and bottom-up).","We have selected one of them known as the bottom-up algorithm. This algorithm has been explained in great detail in (Keogh et al, 2001) and will not be described here. According to Keogh's description, the number of segments produced (which determines the detail to which the data is summarized) depends upon a user-specified limit. In our case, this limit cannot be the same for all segments. Segments joining smaller values might have different error limit compared to those that join larger values. These user-defined limits (thresholds) control the segmentation process in a way suited for summarization. In general, data analysis algorithms such as segmentation need to be adapted to suit the summarization requirements (Sripada et al, 2002). For the initial prototype we have assumed a variety of control values and produced output summaries for each. We intend to obtain feedback on this from the doctors.","Given an input time series, data analysis such as segmentation produces what we call a 'summary series'. In our case, summary series contains intervals with similar trend. In some cases, content for the summary could be derived from all the intervals in the summary series. However, Realization"]},{"title":"-4)","paragraphs":["utput Text 169 as we have observed in the domain of meteorology, we have to include information related to only 'significant' intervals in the summary. In the neonatal domain we need to obtain domain specific knowledge for identifying significant segments (intervals). Initially BP is stable around 30 kpa until 4:23:14. In the next 28 minutes it gradually rises to 41 kpa. It gradually falls to 34 kpa by 5:59:59. Figure 4. Output of our system with limit = 10 BP is stable around 30 kpa until 5:59:59. Figure 5. Output of our system with limit = 30","Figures 4 and 5 show example output of our system running with different limit values. In this paper we are interested in producing purely descriptive textual summaries of neonatal data. Human written summary shown in Figure 2 in-cludes interpretative parts interwoven with the descriptive parts. Producing interpretative summaries of data requires lot of expert domain knowledge. In the current work we do not want to get into building specialist domain knowledge."]},{"title":"5 Planned Experiments","paragraphs":["We plan to conduct small pilot tests with our software, to get general feedback on how useful the summaries are. These would be performed off-ward, and would involve a small number of doctors looking at generated summaries and suggesting improvements (revisions), and perhaps making general comments as well."]},{"title":"5.1 Experimental Evaluation","paragraphs":["When our system is fully developed, we would like to do a proper experimental evaluation. For example, we could set up some kind of diagnosis task, where doctors examine data from a particular baby and diagnose what is wrong with the baby (or say whether the baby has or does not have a particular problem?). Then we could ask a group of doctors to do this task with (a) just graphic visualizations and (b) graphic visualizations and text summaries, and see if there was any significant difference in accuracy, time to make diagnosis, or confidence in decision."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have described our work on summarizing physiological data from a neonatal intensive care. Content selection used segmentation (an existing data analysis technique) controlled by domain knowledge in a similar way to other prototypes. This suggests that perhaps this is a generic approach that could be applied to summarizing many types of time series data."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Sarah Boyd. 1998.
