These models can process local syntactic ambiguity efficiently. However, because the formalism of Finite-State Intersection Grammar (Koskenniemi, 1990; Koskenniemi et al., 1992) allows full regular expressions, its parsing is sometimes inefficient (Tapanainen, 1997); many FSIG constraint automata can reduce ambiguity only after they have scanned the whole sentence.","Regular expressions in FSIG can be viewed as a grammar-writing tool that should be as flexible as possible. This viewpoint has led to introduction of new features into the formalism (Koskenniemi et al., 1992). It is, however, very difficult to make any a priori generalizations of the structural properties of automata as long as we allow unrestricted use of regular expressions.","A complementary view is to analyze the properties of languages described by FSIG regular expressions. We can carry out the analysis by checking whether the languages can be described with a restricted class of regular expressions. For many such classes of expressions, there also exists a group-theoretic characterization (Pin, 1986). Moreover, if the analyzed regular language has favorable properties, some problems, e.g. the string membership problem, can be solved faster by means of specialized algorithms.","A language can be described with a star-free regular expression if it can be constructed from alphabet symbols by application of union (A U B), complementation (A) and finite concatenation (AB), that is, without the Kleene closure (A*). The theoretical importance of this class of languages is supported by its characterization in terms of finite aperiodic syntactic monoids (Schtitzenberger, 1965) and by its definability in first-order logic over strings (McNaughton and Papert, 1971). The class has also a lot of practical importance, because many languages in it admit extremely simple implementations (ibid.).","The question of the star-freeness restriction on FSIG constraints has not been studied before, possibly because of the following observations:","(i) An acyclic automaton representing readings of the sentence has a central role in FSIG parsing (Tapanainen, 1997). Star-freeness of the constraints is a minor restriction when compared to the finiteness of this language. 379","(ii) If automata states are encoded as \"traces\" into strings, any regular language can be represented as a homomorphic image of a (local) star-free language (Medvedev, 1964). Such an encoding is possible in a two-level view of the FSIG framework (Koskenniemi, 1997), where the morphological reading of the sentence is a homomorphic image of a level representing syntactically annotated readings.","(iii) Given a finite automaton or a regular expression, checking star-freeness of the described language is an intractable (see 2.2) problem.","(iv) Automatical methods to derive star-free regular expressions from another representations procuce long and unintuitive expressions (Matz et al., 1995).","From my point of view, these observations miss some important perspectives: Firstly (i), it is important to understand that a finite-state intersection grammar is also a description of a language with a structure of its own, independent of the acyclic sentence automaton. Secondly (ii), a realistic FSIG description is linguistically motivated and leaves little room for encoding of traces that could technically make the grammar star-free. Thirdly (iii), heuristic methods can be used to solve many large star-freeness problems in practice. Fourthly (iv), it is often possible to find star-free regular expressions that are short and illustrative, as it turns out in this paper.","Any automaton recognizing a non-star-free language has a factor that induces a nontrivial permutation of the state space. For example, the parity language 0* (10*10*)* contains strings with an even number of occurrences of the factor \"1\". In-tuitively, it seems improbable that similar counting constraints occur in natural language grammars However, many regular expressions in Voutilainen's ENGFSIG (1994) involve the Kleene star. If we can explain why this does not affect the star-freeness of the language, we probably know more about the grammar itself.","A significant contribution of this paper is the human-readable construction that rephrases ENGFSIG (Voutilainen, 1994) constraints without the Kleene star. To make the construction more systematic I first outline the framework of FSIG and define its star-freeness problem. After this I explore stars in the ENGFSIG description and reduce regular expressions in the description into their star-free equivalents. This approach extends to a closure property of the star-free regular languages under the restriction operator (of FSIG)."]},{"title":"2 Finite-State Intersection Grammar","paragraphs":["In this section I define a class of finite-state intersection grammars and explain the star-freeness problem specific to them.

It is, given a grammar G, to determine whether the language L(G) is star-free i.e. whether it can be constructed from alphabet symbols by application of the boolean operators (U, and concatenation. Proposition 1. For a regular language L, the following properties are equivalent:","• the language L is star-free,","• there is a starfree regular expression, based on concatenation and the boolean operators, that describes the language L,","• the syntactic monoid (McNaughton and Papert, 1968) that is canonically assigned to the language L is aperiodic (Schiitzenberger, 1965),","• the language L is definable in propositional linear temporal logic (Kamp, 1968), and,","• the language L is definable in a first-order logic that is interpreted over finite strings (McNaughton and Papert, 1971).","Sometimes star-freeness of a language can be shown by means of closure properties of star-free languages. To start with, finite regular languages are star-free (especially 0, 6, a, and F, where 0 denotes the empty set of strings, a C E, and F C E) The Kleene closure of any subset F C E is also star-free, because I' = 0[E — F10. If A and B are star-free languages, then we know that at least the following languages are star-free (McNaughton and Papert, 1971): AB A $A AuB AnB A- B","It is also possible that the language of a regular expression is star-free although the expression contains the Kleene star operator.

Each iterated subexpression seems to have two components: (i) a domain of iteration which specifies what kind of unit is iterated, and (ii) a condition which specifies the necessary property for each unit. By unifying every leftoriented domain of iteration (e.g. H @) with the corresponding right-oriented domain (e.g. @ H ), I identified four variants of domains (Table 3). Domain Freq.

In the star-free form of a starred expression, the domain of iteration and the associated condition are defined separately and then combined under the intersection operator. In the following, I give some examples of possible conditions and how they are represented in separation from the domain:","• The phrase \"every @>N 6, 000 @>N miles N @ADVL\" satisfies the constraint \"N H @ADVL","every IE @>N @ [IE @>NIE @]x E 9.

Such a condition translates as follows: — [E* e/ ${@/,mv}] n --$[@/ $mv @/].","• Sometimes the iterated clause Rclause is not allowed to contain center-embeddings.

In addition to these, there are 2657 more complicated constraints. The schematic equivalences presented in Sections 3.3 — 3.4 can transform 1554 of these into a star-free form. However, there still remain 1103 constraints that use the restriction operator To complete the proof of the star-freeness of ENGFSIG, I show that star-free languages are closed under the restriction operation (as in FSIG).","Compilation of the restriction operator (as in Two-Level Morphology) has been solved by means of marker symbols and transducers (Karttunen et al., 1987; Kaplan and Kay, 1994). To compile the restriction as in FSIG, Tapanainen (1992) used also a method that is perhaps most easily described with transducers.

At a later stage, I developed a regular expression preprocessor that automated many tasks. The results were compared across different formulas in order to find possible differences.","The preprocessor could output a script where operands for each restriction operator were defined (and compiled into automata) before the operator was applied. Every bunch of operand definitions was followed by a formula that implemented the restriction operator with a required number of contexts. In order to reduce the number of contexts, I gathered unilateral contexts with the preprocessor.","I developed and tested the presented equivalences using the Xerox Finite-State Tool (v.7.4.0). My new formula for the restriction operator produced automata that were equivalent to the output of Tapanainen's rule compiler (Koskenniemi et al., 1992), which was actually used during the development of ENGFSIG.","I also compared these automata to the ones that would result from using Kaplan and Kay's (1994) method and some variants of it. Some differences in the results suggest that they use another interpretation for the (compound) restriction operator. According to that interpretation, overlapping centers are not restricted conjunctively, sometimes resulting in a bigger language.","Simple optimizations in the formula for an n-context restriction made a notable difference in compilation time. When I compiled a 7-context restriction (this was a striking exception in ENGFSIG), an unoptimized version of my formula was very slow (9 min.) compared to a transducer-based method (34.8 sec.), while an optimized version was roughly as efficient (35.5 sec.). In this example, the number of (outer) conjuncts in my formula was quite high (2 7). The new formula is at its best in the typical case when the number of contexts is smaller than seven.","I did not make experiments with starry subexpressions because they are relatively small and fast to compile anyway. 1= 1 where S = {1 ; 2, ... n} and {E* if i c .F; 0 otherwise; 384"]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["The schematic equivalences presented suggest alternative ways to compile some special cases of Kleene star. The compilation of Kleene closures into deterministic automata involves determinization that is based on the subset construction. On the basis of the equivalences presented here it may be possible to identify more cases for which we can find specialized determinization algorithms (Mohri, 1995).","The new formula for the restriction operator has one extra advantage over compilation methods that are based on marker symbols and transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1994). In these methods, the markers have to be eliminated from the final language. Usually this requires determinization using the costly subset construction. The new formula does not involve markers and it there-fore only needs to apply determinization at smaller sub-formulas.","Methods that reduce the size of constraint automata can contribute to an efficient solution for the FSIG parsing problem (Koskenniemi, 1997) by producing a smaller representation for the grammar. Tapanainen (1992) has developed special optimizations that apply to automata during their construction. The current paper suggests manipulation of FSIG regular expressions before they are compiled into deterministic automata. The value of this approach is based on the fact that the construction of a deterministic automaton from a regular expression is, in the worst-case, exponential.","The current paper provides the FSIG framework with a grammar semantics that is completely based on regular languages and a one-level representation. Our new formula for an n-context restriction operator does not make use of transducers (Tapanainen, 1992) nor markers. In the absence of such complications, axioms for regular expressions (Antimirov and Mosses, 1994) be-come much more usable and may lead to essential simplifications in the individual constraints (see Section 4) and in the grammar altogether.","The new formula for the restriction operator enables us to split an n-context restriction into 2\" separate constraints (under intersection), each of which can be simplified, compiled and applied separately. It is also possible to compile the FSIG regular expressions directly into a single alternating finite automaton where intersection and complementation can occur inside the grammar automaton. Manipulation of alternating automata (Vardi, 1995) may help us to avoid the state explosion that is the main problem with deterministic automata in FSIG parsing (Tapanainen, 1997).","Finally, the main contribution of this paper is to show that ENGFSIG describes a star-free set of strings. It seems probable that this narrowing could be added to the FSIG framework in general.","The computational complexity of many important decision problems for the FSIG grammars remains intractable in spite of the star-freeness property (Sistla and Clarke, 1985). Nevertheless, the improved descriptive complexity allows us to simplify some algorithms; we can, for example, implement the grammar with the class of loop-free alternating automata (Salomaa and Yu, 2000). Moreover, the restriction also means that the grammar is definable in a first-order logic that is interpreted over finite strings (McNaughton and Papert, 1971). This simplification is relevant to reconstruction of FSIG and similar finite-state models with logical specifications (Vaillette, 2001; Lager and Nivre, 2001)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, the ENGFSIG description as a whole is shown to be a regular expression that reduces to a combination of union, complementation and finite concatenation.
