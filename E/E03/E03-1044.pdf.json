(2) Peter goB Wasser auf die Blumen. (3) Peter fiillte den Tank (mit Wasser).","Peter.N filled the tank.A (with water)","\"Peter filled the tank (with water)\". (4) Peter fiillte Wasser in den Tank.","(1)-(4) are examples of German predicates which participate in the so-called Locative alternation phenomena (see among others Dowty (1991), Rappaport and Levin (1988), Levin and Rap apport Hovav (1991)). Alternations in German with the locative verbs fallen (fill) and giefien (pour) are of the general form presented in Section (1). The main features of these verbs in German (English, Modern Greek, and some other languages) is that they are morphologically identical and that they involve two arguments: one denoting a location and one denoting the locatum (die Blumen (flowers)Iden Tank (tank) and Wasser (water), respectively, in (1)-(4) above). 2.2 Removal Predicates The removal predicates in German also take locaturn and location arguments and they are distinguished in the following groups:","1. Predicates (like leeren/entleeren (empty)) which imply a change of state of the location argument when it is realized as the direct object of the verb:","(5) Peter leerte den Tank. Peter.N emptied the tank.A \"Peter emptied the tank\".","(6) Peter leerte das Wasser aus dem Tank. Peter emptied the water.A from the tank \"Peter emptied the water from the tank\". 111","2. Predicates which denote a contact with the location, as well as a change of location. These predicates may also specify the manner or the instrument related to the action of moving (wischen (wipe)). wischen does not admit a von-PP (of/from-PP) complement when its location argument is realized as the direct object (example (7)). In this case wischen does not entail the existence of a locatum argument. For instance, the act of wiping a board does not necessarily result in wiping something off it.","(7) *Peter wischte die Tafel\\tvon Kreide. Peter.N wiped the board.A from chalk","Peter wiped the board of chalk\".","(8) Peter wischte die Kreide von der Tafel. Peter.N wiped the chalk.A from the board \"Peter wiped the chalk from the board\".","3. saubern (trim) is different than wischen (wipe), though, in the sense that \"trimming an object\" necessarily means \"trimming something off this object\":","(9) Peter sauberte den Busch von trockenen Peter.N trimmed the bush.A of dry Asten. branches \"Peter trimmed the bush of dry branches\". 2.3 Impingement Predicates A typical impingement verb in German is schlagen (hit). According to Dowty (1991), the verb hit (in English) does not imply any change of state for any of its arguments which may surface syntactically as direct object. The same semantic entailments also hold for the German verb schlagen. schlagen is an assymetric predicate in that when the location argument is realized as the direct object of the predicate the locatum argument is optional, but when the locatum argument is realized as the direct object all arguments are obligatory.","(10) Peter schlagt den Gong (mit dem KlOppel). Peter.N hits\\tthe gong.A (with the clapper) \"Peter hits the gong with the clapper\".","(11) Peter schlagt den KlOppel gegen den Gong. Peter.N hits\\tthe clapper.A against the gong \"Peter hits the clapper against the gong\". (12) *Peter schlagt den KlOppel.","For verbs in the schlagen (hit) subclass of German, the mit (with) alternant (example (10)) entails that one of the arguments (i.e., the locatum) is understood as the instrument (\"means\") which is used by the actor in order to perform the action denoted by the verb. The \"gegen\" (against) alternant (see example (11)), on the other hand, entails that the locatum undergoes directed motion."]},{"title":"3 Locative Alternation in German: The Analysis","paragraphs":["The account we suggest here for locative alternation in German (see examples in Section (2) above) follows the proposal of Koenig and Davis (2000) for valence alternations, including locative alternation in English. Their analysis is based on a minimal recursion approach to semantic representation and is formalized using the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) framework of Copestake et al. (1999). In brief, Minimal Recursion Semantics is a framework for computational semantics, in which the meaning of expressions is represented as a flat bag of Elementary Predications (or EPs) encoded as values of a LISZT attribute. The denotation of this bag is equivalent to the logical conjunction of its members. Scope relations between EPs are represented as explicit relations among EPs. Such scope relations can also be underspecified. The assumption of current MRS is that each lexical item (other than those with empty EP bags) has a single distinguished main EP, which is referred to as the KEY EP. All other EPs share a label with the KEY EP. According to Koenig and Davis (2000), for situation-denoting EPs, which are also most interesting for our purposes here, the following generalizations hold: (i) EPs do not encode recursively embedded state-of-affairs (SOAs); (ii) EPs can have one, two, or three arguments; (iii) if an EP has three arguments, then one of them is a state-of-affairs, and another is an undergoer coindexed with an argument of the embedded state-of-affairs. Finally, as far as direct arguments are concerned, in Koenig and Davis (2000) these are predicted to link off the value of the KEY attribute. 3.1 The verbs giefien and fallen Following the lexical list hypothesis of Koenig and Davis (2000), according to which lexical items in-112 SOA"]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["ch-oploc-rel FIG CI SOA [ch-of-loc-rel FIG CI SOA [ch-of-st-rel] UND fri [ mit-rdl ACT UND SOA CI II elude more than one EPs in their semantic content, but lexically they select only one of these EPs as their KEY, we propose that the semantic properties of the arguments of the verb giefien (water) in example (1) of Section (2.1) above are captured by the following semantic type:","(13) CONTENT value of giefienmit - giefien-ch-ofst-rel - ACT A (Peter) UND p (die Blumen) SOA [ch-of-st-rel UND ACT LISZT ( II CI (13) above captures that the mit (with) alternant of the German locative verb giefien (example (1)) denotes situations that must be both changes of state and changes of location.","The locative alternant of the verb giefien (example (2) of Section (2.1)) denotes only a simple change of location. This is captured by the following semantic type:","(14) CONTENT value of gie.fienio, - giefien-ch-of-loc-rel -","- ACT II (Peter)","KEY El UND (Wasser) LISZT ( The analysis presented above holds also for both alternants of the verb fallen (fill; examples (3) and (4) in Section (2.1)). One clarification is due here concerning the mit (with) alternant of the verb fiillen (example (3) of Section (2.1)), where the PP (mit Wasser) appears to be optional: we assume that the PP carries existential import, even when it is not syntactically overt. 3.2 Removal Predicates In the spirit of the MRS-based analysis for the German verbs gieflen and fi,illen that we have presented above, we propose that the semantic properties of the arguments of one of the most representative verbs of the removal predicates class in German, the verb wischen (wipe), which denotes a change of location, when a locatum argument is realized as its direct object (see example (8) in Section (2.2)), are captured by the following type:","(15) CONTENT value of wischenioc wischen-ch-of-loc-rel ACT U (Peter) UND El (die Kreide)","LISZT El)- saubern (trim; see example (9) in Section (2.2)","and (16) below) is different than wischen:","(16) CONTENT value of stiubernvon sdubem-ch-of-st-rel - ACT U (Peter) UND (den Busch) - sattbem-ch-of-loc-rer ACT LISZT ( SOA [ch-of-loc-rel FIG El","That is, as (16) above captures, in German trimming necessarily results in trimming something off something else; in the case of example (9) above trimming the bush results in trimming the dry branches off the bush. And this is what the semantic type in (16) captures. 3.3 Impingement Predicates In order to capture the semantic properties of the arguments of the most representative verb of the impingement predicates class in German, the verb schlagen (hit) in examples (10)-(12) above, we propose the semantic types in (17) and (18), which are in the spirit of the MRS-based analysis that we have presented for the verbs giefien and fiillen and for the removal predicates in German.","(17) and (18) capture that the German impingement verb schlagen (hit) is an assymetric predicate in that when the location argument is realized as the direct object of the predicate the locatum argument might be optional (see SOA (El) in (18)), but when the locatum argument is realized as the direct object all arguments are obligatory KEY El SOA [ch-of-loc-rel"]},{"title":"F","paragraphs":["IG UND (Wasser) KEY El KEY 11 11 ' [ von-rdl ACT SOAUND ElCI UND El (Asten) 113 ElSOA","El El El LISZT ( [ gegen rel ACT UND S OA El - schl-dmtc-rel ACT UND ACT II (Peter) UND El (den Kliippel)","(18) CONTENT value of schlagehmit [ schlagen-rel ACT"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["(Peter) UND gi (den Gong) ElKEY ElKEY II (Kliippel) [ contact-rdl ACT UND SOA (El) _","ACT CIUND ElLISZT CI ElSOA II [ directedinotion_to_contact-rel","CIFIG GRND (den Gong) SOA"]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["dmtc-rel FIG GRNDEl (see (17)).

Here we focussed on (some of) the theoretical assumptions upon which the achievement of such a goal can be based realistically. A presentation of the technical details of the LKB implementation of the grammar frag-ment that we have described above, which practically does not differ much from what we have presented in the types of Section (3), is not included here due to lack of space, but is available for the presentation of the paper."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions and Outlook","paragraphs":["As a final general comment we need to underline that the MRS-based analysis we have presented in Section (3) above allows for a linguistically motivated account of the syntactic properties of apparent semantic doublets (i.e., what we have called \"valence alternants\"), which avoids the processing load problems that are inseparable from (directional or even bi-directional a la Flickinger (1987)) lexical rule approaches to verbal alternations in particular and to development of (the lexicon of) large-scale computational grammars of natural language based on HPSG in general.
