As they get more familiar with the web, users soon realize that their portal covers only a tiny fraction of the web, and move to keyword search engines. But as their information needs and sophistication grow, so does their frustration with simple keyword search. As a result seemingly obscure features, such as boolean searches, wildcards, and topic classification become increasingly relevant to them. To most users, the ideal system would be one that combines the ease of navigation provided e.g. by Yahoo with the near-exhaustive coverage provided e.g. by Google. But topic classification the Yahoo way, by professional editors, is expensive, and the results of using amateur editors, as in dmoz, are often highly questionable.","One way to address the problem of low editorial bandwidth is to automate the topic classification process. Section 1 of this paper describes [origo.hu], a Hungarian portal that uses both manual and automatic topic classification, and gives a brief overview of the keyword search and autoclassification technology developed by Northern Light Technology (NLT, now part of divine Inc) that is deployed on the Hungarian web, which currently has about 20 million unique pages. As we shall see, this is a very successful system, both in terms of standard performance measures and in terms of end-user satisfaction.","In Section 2 we turn to the main question of the paper: why is this algorithm, which is in many ways closer to classic TF-IDF than modern TRECstyle topic detection systems, performing so well? We present a formal analysis of what we take to be the essential part of the topic classification problem, and argue that the characteristics revealed by this analysis justify the use of methods that are simpler than generally thought acceptable.

The page rank-ing algorithm, which uses links as one of many factors, has been discussed elsewhere (Krellenstein, 2002). Here we concentrate on the topic classification engine, which differs from its TREC counterparts in several relevant respects. First, the number of topics considered is very large (22,000 for the English hierarchy developed at NLT), as opposed to the few dozen to a few hundred topics considered e.g. in the Reuters work. Second, the assumption is that the typical document has only one dominant topic (or none, as we will discuss later). Two-topic documents are rare, three or more topics for a single document occur seldom enough to be negligible in the sense that we see no practical need for returning more than two topics per document (though the engine of course has the facilities for doing so, should the need arise in some non-web application). Finally, we assume that training data is available only in very small quantities, only a handful of documents per category, as opposed to the hundreds of training documents per category used in TREC.","Axelero's katalagus system is a mature, highly coherent work of knowledge engineering, 2 with a keyword-spotting hook into the search query system. As such, it provided an excellent basis for the NLT autoclassification system, which was trained on the basis of the high quality exemplary documents already manually classified to it. Translating the large NLT topic hierarchy from English to Hungarian was not feasible in the deployment timeframe, but even if it were, we would have been faced with the formidable challenge of finding Hungarian exemplaries for many thousands of highly detailed NLT topics. Using the katakigus also made sense because it was cul-","2The internal coherence of the system no doubt owes a great deal to the fact that originally it was developed by one person, Rudolf Ungvary, Hungarian National Library. 204 turally more appropriate (e.g. in the selection of sports it has a section for table tennis but not for American football) so the chances of finding more Hungarian webpages on the topic are higher. Besides using a native Hungarian topic hierarchy, the system also relies on a morphological analysis (stemming) component developed specifically for Hungarian by Gabor PrOszeky and his associates at Morphologic Inc. We keep both the original (inflected) and the stemmed version available for keyword match and topic classification, since this produces superior results to using either of them alone.","Other than these two instances of necessary localization, there is nothing in our system that is specifically geared toward Hungarian, and therefore we believe that the conclusions we draw about this particular algorithm apply to all topic classification systems with the same broad characteristics:","1. monolingual input 2. small amount of training data available 3. large number of topic categories 4. few documents with multiple topics In what follows we illustrate some of our points on a version of the old Reuters corpus, keeping the standard (Lewis) test/train split, but removing all articles that have more than one topic, and all topics that have less than three training examples. Needless to say, removal of the multitopic documents and the topics with extremely limited training makes the task easier: Bow TF-IDF (McCallum, 1996) obtains 92.51% correct classification on this set with the default settings. But our in-tention is not to \"report results\" on a corpus with 21578 (or, after removal, 8998) documents: our results are on the Hungarian web, a corpus over three orders of magnitude larger, and displaying all the difficulties of real language data, such as lack of consistent style, large numbers of typos, search engine spamming, etc. that are largely absent from Reuters."]},{"title":"2 The bag of words model","paragraphs":["We assume a collection of documents D and a system of topics T such that T partitions D into largely disjoint subsets DI c D(t E T). We will use a finite set of words wi , w2. , wN arranged on order of decreasing frequency. N is generally in the range 10 5 — 10 6 — for words not in this set we introduce a catchall unknown word wo. By general language we mean a probability distribution GL that assigns the appropriate frequencies to the w, either in some large collection of topicless texts, or in a corpus that is appropriately representative of all topics. By the (word unigram) probability model of a topic t we mean a probability distribution Gt that assigns the appropriate frequencies gt (wz ) to the wi in a large collection of documents about t. Given a collection C we call the number of documents that contain w the document frequency of the word, denoted DF(D,C), and we call the total number of w tokens its term frequency in C, denoted TF(w,C).","Assume that the set of topics T = {t 1 ,tk,... ,tk} is arranged in order of decreasing probability Q(T) = ql.q2,... qk. Let","qz = T <1, so that a document is topicless with probability qo = 1 —T. The general language probability of a word w can therefore be computed on topicless documents to be p ip = GL (w) or as","g,g,(w). In practice, it is next to impossible to collect a large set of truly topicless documents, so we estimate pw based on a collection D that we assume to be representative of the distribution Q of topics. It should be noted that this procedure, while workable, is fraught with difficulties, since in general the q3 are not known, and even for very large collections it can't always be assumed that the proportion of documents falling in topic j estimates q3 well.","As we shall see shortly, within a given topic t only a few dozen, or perhaps a few hundred, words are truly characteristic (have gt (w) significantly higher than the background probability gaw)) and our goal will be to find these. To this end, we need to first estimate GL: the trivial method is to use the uncorrected observed frequency gL(w) = TF(w,C)IL(C) where L(C) is the length of the corpus C (total number of word tokens in it). While this is obviously very at-tractive, the numerical values so obtained tend to be highly unstable. For example, the word with makes up about 4.44% of a 55m word sample of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) but 5.00% of a"]},{"title":"205","paragraphs":["46m word sample of the San Jose Mercury News (Mere). For medium frequency words, the effect is even more marked: for example uniform appears 7.65 times per million word in the WSJ and 18.7 times per million in the Merc sample. And for low frequency words, the straightforward estimate very often comes out as 0, which tends to introduce singularities in models based on the estimates.","The same uncorrected estimate, gt (w) = T F (w, Dt ) I L(Dt ) is of course available for Gt , but the problems discussed above are made worse by the fact that any topic-specific collection of documents is likely to be orders of magnitude smaller than our overall corpus. Further, if Gt is a Bernoulli source, the probability P(d1 t) that a document d containing l instances of wi, 12 instances of w2, etc. is produced by the source for topic t will be given by the multinomial formula (io + /1 + • • • + /N) which will be zero as long as any of the gt (wz ) are zero. Therefore, we will smooth the probabilities in the topic model by the (uncorrected) probabilities that we obtained for general language, since the latter are of necessity positive. Instead of gt (w) we will therefore use agaw) + (1 — a)gt (w) (2) where is a small but non-negligible constant, usually between .1 and .3. In the recent literature, e.g. (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001), this is generally called Jelinek-Mercer smoothing. 3 There are two ways to justify this method: the trivial one is to say that documents are not fully topical, but can be expected to contain a small a portion of general language. A more interesting justification is to treat the general language probability as a Bayesian prior, the topic-specific frequency as the maximum likelihood estimate based on the observations, so that (2) will be the posterior mean of the unknown probability. For the Reuters experiment, we used the 46m Merc wordcount as our general (background) language model.","3Actually the first to apply this technique to topic detection was Gish (1993-1994 Switchboard tasks, see (Colbath, 1998)).","What words, if any, are specific to a few topics in the sense that P(d E Dt lw E d) >> P(d"]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["Di )? This is well measured by the number of documents containing the word: for example Fourier appears in only about 200k documents in a large collection containing over 200m English documents (see www. . northernlight . corn), while see occurs in 42m and book in 29m.

In general, words with low DF values, or what is the same, high IDF (inverse document frequency) values are good candidates for being topic-specific, though this criterion has to be used with care: it is quite possible that a word has high IDF because of deficiencies in the corpus, not because it is inherently very specific. For example, the word alternately has even higher IDF than Fourier, yet it is hard to imagine any topic that would call for its use more often than others.","Recall that topics are modeled by Bernoulli (word unigram) sources: given a document with word counts 1, and total length 71, if we make the naive Bayesian assumption that the l are independent, the probability that topic t emitted this document will be obtained by substituting (2) in (1): (/0 /N)"]},{"title":"ri","paragraphs":["•","(","cygL (","wi )","+ (1— ci)gt (wi )) 1'","10, • • • ,IN i=0","(3) For the 0th topic, general language, (1) and (3) are the same.

As the above reasoning makes clear, linearity is to some extent a matter of choice: certainly the underlying bag of words assumption, that the words are chosen independent of one another, is quite dubious. However, it is a good first approximation, and one can extend it from Bernoulli (0 order Markov) to first, second, third order, etc. Once the probabilities of word pairs, word triples, etc are explicitly modeled, much of the criticism directed at the bag of words approach loses its grip. 4","A relevance-based linear classifier containing for all topics all the words that appeared in its training set gives 91.13% correct classification: this has 2154 words in the average topic model.

NLT's proprietary word selection algorithm gets to the 80% level with 30 words per model. Reducing the model size even more drastically would take us out of the realm of practically acceptable classifiers, but as an illustration of our main point it should be noted that keeping the 5 best words in each model would give 46.8% correct classification, and keeping just one word, the one with the greatest relevance for each topic, already gives 28.5% correct classification (on this set, random choice would give less than 3%)."]},{"title":"3 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In Section 2 we argued that for topic classification only positive evidence, i.e. words with significantly higher than background probability, will ever matter. Though we illustrated this point on a standard corpus, we wish to emphasize that it is not this toy example, but rather the objectively measurable user satisfaction with the large-scale system described in Section 1, that provides the empirical underpinnings of our theoretical argument.","If only the best (positive) evidence is used, the models can be sparse, in the sense of having nonzero coefficients r(u,",", t) only for a few dozen, or perhaps a few hundred words u) for a given topic t, even though the number of words considered, N, is typically in the hundred thousands to millions (Kornai and Richards, 2002). An important side effect of this approach is that many documents, not containing a sufficient number of keywords for any topic, will be treated as topicless (part of the general language) i.e. they are rejected from classification. Given the nature and quality of many web documents, this is a desirable out-come.","Not knowing that the parameter space is sparse, for k = 104 topics and N = 106 words we 208 would need to estimate kN = 10 10 parameters even for the simplest (unigram) model. This may be (barely) within the limits of our supercomput-ing ability, but it is definitely beyond the reliabil-ity and representativeness of our data. Over the years, this led to a considerable body of research on feature selection, which tries to address the is-sue by reducing N, and on hierarchical classification, which addresses it by reducing k.","We can't discuss here in detail the problems in-herent in hierarchical classification, but we note that for a practical topic detection system higher nodes e.g. film director are often next to impossible to train, even though lower nodes e.g. Spielberg, Fellini, ... will perform well. As for feature selection, we find that much of the literature suffers from what we will call the once a feature, always a feature (OAFAAF) fallacy: if a word w is found distinctive for topic t, an attempt is made to estimate g8 (w) for the whole range of s, rather than the one value gt(w) that we really care about.","The fact that high quality working classifiers such as vi z sla can be built using only sparse subsets of the whole potential feature set reflects a deep, structural property of the data: at least for the purpose of comparing log emission probabilities across topic models, the GI can be approximated by sparse distributions S. In fact, this structural property is so strong that it is possible to build classifiers that ignore the differences between the numerical values of g8 (w) and gt (w) entirely, replacing both by a uniform estimate g(w) based on the IDF of w. Traditionally, the it multipliers in (7) are known as the term frequency (TF) factor. Such systems, where the classification load is carried entirely by the zero-one decision of using a particular word as a keyword for a topic, are the simplest TF-IDF classifiers, and the estimation method used in Section 2 fits in the broad tradi-tion of deriving IDF-like weights (Robertson and Walker, 1997) from language modeling considerations (?; Hiemstra and Kraaij, 2002; Miller et al., 1999).","What he have done in the body of the paper was to create a new rationale for a classical TF-IDF system, not just for vi z s la but for any system along the same lines. The notion of good keywords is often used, though not always defined, in information retrieval. We believe that this is an entirely valid notion, and offered a simple operational definition, has significantly higher than background probability, to capture it. Our basic claim was that only the good keywords (positive evidence) matter, and the overall performance of our classification system largely supports this assertion."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["A large system such as vizsla is always the work of many people.
