While tagging with morphosyntactic categories has become a standard for almost all corpora, more and more of them are nowadays annotated with refined syntactic information. Examples are the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) for American English annotated at the University of Pennsylvania, the French treebank (AbelIle and Clement, 1999) developed in Paris, the NEGRA Corpus (Brants et al., 1999) for German annotated at the University of Saarbriicken, and the Tubingen Treebanks (Hinrichs et al., 2000) for Japanese, German and English from the University of Tithingen. To make these rich syntactic an-notations accessible for linguists the development of powerful query tools is an obvious need and has become an important task in computational linguistics.","In this paper, we present finite"]},{"title":"structure query","paragraphs":["(fsq), a query tool for syntactically annotated corpora. Special emphasis in the development of fsq is layed on providing users a very powerful query language. Therefore full first-order logic was chosen as query language which allows arbitrary quantifications over nodes in a tree. This choice is to the authors' knowledge unique, no other query tool offers such an expressive power. It is on the other hand not arbitrary, we will show that there are interesting linguistic queries that require such an expressive power. The tool is developed for treebanks in NEGRA export format (Brants, 1997), but can be adopted to other corpus formats as well. The linguistic examples that follow are from the Tubingen Treebanks 1.1 The Tiibingen Treebanks The Tiibingen Treebanks, annotated at the University of Tiibingen, comprise a German, an English and a Japanese treebank consisting of spoken dialogs restricted to the domain of arranging business appointments. In this paper, we focus on the German treebank (TiiBa-D) (Stegmann et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000) that contains approximately 38.000 trees.","The treebank is part-of-speech tagged using the Stuttgart-TUbingen tag set (STTS) developed by Schiller et al. (1995). One of the design decisions for the development of the treebank was the commitment to reusability. As a consequence, the choice of the syntactic annotation scheme should not reflect a particular syntactic theory but rather be as theory-neutral as possible. Therefore a surface-oriented scheme was adopted to structure German sentences that uses the notion of topological fields in a sense similar to that of Mile (1985).

The syntactic categories follow traditional phrase structure and the theory of topological fields. An example of a tree can be found in Figure 1. To cope with the characteristics of spontaneous speech, the data structures in the Tiibingen Treebanks are of a more general form than trees. For example, an entry may consist of several tree structures. It also may contain completely disconnected nodes. In contrast to NEGRA or the Penn Treebank, there are neither crossing branches nor empty categories.","The design goal of fsq has been to make this rich annotation queryable for linguists."]},{"title":"2 The Query Language of fsq 2.1","paragraphs":["Syntax In order to provide a high expressive power, full first-order logic is chosen as the query language for fsq. Atomic formulae express the syntactic annotation of a node in a tree or the relationships between nodes such as dominance or precedence. Hence, variables, words made of letters and dig-its, are supposed to range over nodes in a tree. The formula (or query) syntax is LISP-like. Let x and y be variables and let T be a token, C a category,","a morphological tag, and F a function from the annotation scheme. The atomic formulae are as follows: • (= x y)\\t\"x equals y\" • (> x y)\\t\"x is the mother of y\" • (>> x y)\\t\"x dominates y\" • ( . x y)\\t\"x immediately precedes y\" • (\\tx y) \"x precedes y\" • (tok x T) \"x has token T\" • (cat x C) \"x is of category C\" • (mar x M) \"x has morphological tag ivi\" • (fct x F) \"x is of function F\" • (refl x y) \"there is a ref 1-secondary edge","from x to y\" Trees in the treebank may have secondary edges. An example is the ref1 edge from the TUBa-D, which expresses a reference relation between infinitival verbs in a verb complex. Complex formulae are constructed in a way normal for first-order logic.

Then the following are well-formed formulae: • (\\t(p)\\t (negation) • ( & (pi • \\t(conjunction)","• (\\t(pi • • • (pn)\\t (disjunction) • (—>\\t)\\t (implication) • (E x"]},{"title":"(p) \\t","paragraphs":["(existential quantification) • (A x"]},{"title":"(p) \\t","paragraphs":["(universal quantification)","A query is a closed formula, i.e., a formula where each variable is bound by some quantifier."]},{"title":"2.2","paragraphs":["Semantics One central idea of fsq is to regard a tree or tree-like structure as a finite first-order structure. The reason behind this decision is that a finite structure is the common denominator for existing treebanks and corpus formats. A closer look not only at the Tiibingen Treebanks reveals that most of these corpora do not only contain proper trees in the mathematical sense. Some of these extensions of trees may be harmless. But some of them, like secondary relations, can, if used extensively, transcend the tree structure completely. A query approach that is designed to cope with all of these extensions therefore needs to opt for a general data structure. And the one data structure that fits"]},{"title":"180","paragraphs":["most easily with all treebank formats is that of a finite first-order structure.","One big advantage of the approach of regarding a \"tree\" as a finite first-order structure is that we are immediately given a very natural and widely understood semantics for queries, namely classical first-order logic semantics. The universe of a structure is a finite set of nodes. Relations like (immediate) dominance and precedence as well as secondary edges are interpreted as binary predicates over nodes. Relations like token, category, morphology, or function each introduce a finite family of unary predicates. Each such predicate stands for a particular token (or category or function) value like, e.g., the German word Hannover.","More formally, the signature for a treebank consists of the two binary relation symbols Id, Ip (for immediate dominance and immediate precedence), up to 8 binary relation symbols Sec, for secondary relations, and finite families (I', )i<i<k, (C,)] ‹,</, (M1)1<1‹,0 , and (F1 ) 1< ,<,,, of unary predicate symbols (for tokens, categories, morphological tags, and functions). A tree is a finite first-order interpretation of this signature, and a treebank is a finite sequence of trees.","Let T = (N , (Id . I p, See ,\\t, Secs, (Ti) , (Ci), (M,),(F,))) be a tree, and X be a set of variables. A variable assignment a : X N is a function that assigns a node from N to each variable.

As a result, a query or closed formula is true or false of a tree. Thus, a tree is an answer to a query, if it is a model for the query. And the result of a query on a treebank is the set of all trees which are models of the query. 2.3 Expressive Power The primary idea behind fsq is to provide a query system with a powerful language and clear and well-established semantics. We therefore opted to use full first-order logic as a query language. In this section, we will show the expressive power of this query language with linguistically motivated examples.","When so-called fuzzy tree fragments (see (Wallis and Nelson, 2000)) were first introduced, they provided a significant progress over simple string matching languages. Nowadays they are standard, every sensitive query tool for syntactically annotated corpora offers this type of underspecification, and fsq is no exception to this rule. We will therefore bypass them completely. Due to space restrictions, we will neither show how to query unconnected sub-parts of a tree. The reader interested in this issue is referred to the article by Kallmeyer and Steiner (2003). Everything discussed there for the query tool VIQTORYA can be queried by fsq, too. Rather we focus on the use of quantification, something that fsq offers, but no other query tool does in a similar way.","Suppose we are looking for trees where a clause lacks the subject. We can pose the following query to do so: 1 ]x SIMPX (x) A"]},{"title":"Vy((x>>","paragraphs":["y) —iON(y) ) The formula reads \"There is a clause node (node of category SIMPX) such that no node below it is a subject node (node of function ON (Object in the Nominative)).\" An example result is the tree in Figure 1. Another result from the same corpus would be \"aber gut, wir kOnnen ja malfragen, was gegeben wird.\" (All right, we can ask, what's on play.) where there is no subject in the German subordinate clause. If one is interested in finding only those trees where the subject is lacking in a","'For better readability, we use classical first-order logic syntax and not fsq syntax. 181 subordinate clause, the above query has to be extended to","]x]y SIMPX(x) A SIMPX(y) A (x >> y) A (x y) A (Vz ((y >> z) A ON(z))) \"There are two different clause nodes, one dominating the other, and no node below the lower clause node is a subject node.\" This is a query of quantifier depth 3 (number of deepest nestings of quantifiers). On second thought one can see that this query is still too simple to find all subordinate clauses without subject. It does not reflect the possibility to have a subordinate clause with subject as a subclause of a subordinate clause without subject. Here is a query that does: (Query 1)","]x]y SIMPX(x) A SIMPX(y) A (x >> y) A (x y) A (Vz ON(z)\\t(y >> z) V","]14; SIMPX(w) A (y >> w) A","(y w) A (w >> z))) \"There are two different clause nodes, one dominating the other, and every subject node is either not dominated by the lower clause node or there is a further clause node intervening.\" This query is even of quantifier depth 4.","Another complicated query must be used if we want to find all trees in which the main clause lacks the subject, but subordinate clauses may have one. The query looks like this:","Ax SIMPX(x) A (Vy SIMPX(y) (x >> y A x y)) A (Vy((x > > y) A ON(y)))","Az (SIMPX(z) A (x >> z) A","(xy)A(z>>y))) \"There is a highest clause node such that for every subject node dominated by it there is a second clause node intervening.\"","Suppose now, we want to find trees with no Vorfeld. We can do this by querying: (ay SIMPX (x)) A (Vy —iVF(y)) \"There is a clause node but no Vorfeld node.\" A look at the result trees shows that many of them, e.g., \"kein Problem, geht auf die Spesenrechnung\" (no problem, will be put on the travel expenses bill) have unconnected subparts. If we find that undesirable, we conjoin the above query with the simple AxVy(x >> y) demanding a proper root node, and then get nicer results like \"machen wir den Juli\" (Let's take July).","Many more interesting examples for involved queries could be provided, but space does not per-mit to do so. When a linguist actually starts extracting instances of more complicated syntactic phenomena, he will quickly develop a desire to have access to arbitrary quantification in the query language. That's why we chose to provide this in the query language of fsq. 2.4 Complexity Issues One of the fundamental insights of database theory is that there is a price to pay for providing a powerful query language, and this price is that the evaluation of a query can become quite expensive. On the theoretical side it is the so-called data complexity that is relevant for us. This notion, in-troduced by Vardi (1982), describes the complexity of evaluating a query in terms of the size of the database or treebank. It is common knownledge that the problem of evaluating a first-order sentence on a finite structure is in the complexity class LOGSPACE and therefore in PTIME in terms of the size of the structure (see, e.g., (Vardi, 1982)). But it is currently unknown, whether the problem fits into a proper subclass of PTIME in the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., whether there is a fixed exponent — independent of the structure and the query — such that the evaluation time is in the order of the size of the structure to the power of that exponent (see, e.g., the work by Stolboushkin and Taitslin (1994), which suggests a negative answer to the question).","The algorithm implemented in fsq, although simple, has a data complexity of PTIME. More precisely, if n is the number of nodes in a tree and k is the quantifier depth of the query, then the algorithm evaluates the query on the tree in time 0(nk). As stated above, it is not known whether algorithms with a better complexity do exist at all.","Practically, this result is of course not unproblematic, and the question arises at what quantifier depth the evaluation time of a query becomes so long that it exceeds user sustainable response time. Our tests indicate that a strict quantifier bound can not really be given for fsq. Queries 182 of quantifier depth up to and including 3 pose no problem, they are almost instantaneously answered. Queries of depth 4 can take more time to answer: Some of them, like Query 1 in the previous section are answered in 2-3 seconds, others like Query 2 below require an evaluation time of half an hour. (All: wall clock time on a Pentium IV, 1.6GHz system.) Response times therefore depend on the individual query and the corpus.","A solution to the problem of longer response times can sometimes be found in a reformulation of the query. The same content can be logically formulated in different ways with formulas hav-ing quite different quantifier depth. Let us high-light this fact by an example. Suppose a user looks for the four words (tokens) heute, Treffen, in, and Hannover to appear together in a tree. This could be formulated as follows: (Query 2)","(E x (E y (E z (E w (& (tok x heute) (tok y Treffen)","(tok z in) (tok w Hannover) ) )) ) ) with quantifier depth 4. But it could also be formulated as","(& (E x (tok x heute) ) (E x (tok x in) ) (E x (tok x Treffen) ) (E x (tok x Hannover))) with quantifier depth just 1!"]},{"title":"3 The Architecture of fsq fsq","paragraphs":["consists of three main parts: A treebank initialiser, the query engine, and a graphical user interface to the query engine. All components of fsq are implemented in Java JDK 1.3. No propriatory or special libraries are used, so fsq can be run on any standard Java runtime environment (JRE 1.3) independent of the platform and operating system chosen. 3.1 Initialising a Treebank The input format of treebanks fsq can cope with is the NEGRA export format (Brants, 1997). This format is designed for data exchange and to be readable by humans. It is not very well suited as a format to be queried, because relations between nodes are implicitely instead of explicitely represented. Therefore we need an initialisation step that transforms the NEGRA format into one that can be queried a lot faster. The query format is a compact binary representation of the relations of the trees. Each tree has its own representation, independent of the others. The binary relations (dominance, precedence, etc.) are represented as a twodimensional quadratic array indexed by the nodes of the particular tree. Each cell of the array states for all relations if the two nodes addressing the cell stand in the relations or do not. The unary relations (token, category, morphology, and function) are represented by a onedimensional array indexed again by the nodes of the tree. Each cell codes the category and function of the addressing node. Needless to say that the initialisation step has to be performed only once per treebank. On a 1.5MB treebank of TiiBa-D, it typically takes 2-4 minutes (wall clock time, Pentium IV, 1.6GHz), so it's rather fast for a precompilation step. 3.2 The Query Engine The query engine parses a submitted query and successively evaluates it on each finite structure. Due to the clarity of the query syntax, the parsing step is simple and quickly performed. A query is a first order formula and therefore inductively defined. It is evaluated on a tree by a structural recursion on its form. During this recursion, a variable assignment, which is initially empty, is constructed stepwise. The evaluation of an existential quantification is achieved by extending the current variable assignment by supplying a value for the existentially quantified variable and then recursing on the body of the quantification with the extended variable assignment. For completeness reasons it is clear that each node of the structure under evaluation has to be at some time the value of the quantified variable. This is achieved by a loop. The first recursion returning true renders the formula true. If the body is evaluated to false under any assignment of a node to the quantified variable, the formula is false. Universally quantified formulae are evaluated similarly. The evaluation of a boolean connective is a straightforward recursion. In the case of a conjunction, e.g., each conjunct is evaluated separately with the current variable assignment. Only if each conjunct evaluates to true, the evaluation value of the conjunction is true, too. Of course, we stop the evalu-183 File Form Atomic Complex info Corpus I/opt/corpora/TueBaD/cd15 .dat\\t I CI refine (E x (E y (E z (E w (& (tok x heute) (tok y Treffen) (tok z In) (tok w Hannover)))))) E y (E z (E w (& (tok x heute)(tok y Treffen)(tok z in) (tok w Hannover))))) E z (E\\t(& (tok x heute)(tok y Treffen)(tok z in) (tok w Hannover)))) E w (& (tok x heute) (tok y Treffen) (tok z in) (tok w Hannover))) & (tok x heute) (tok y Treffen)(tok z in) (tok w Hannover)) tok x heute) tok y Treffen) tok z in) tok a Hannover)","I Submit I I Result I\\t Quit I Figure 2: Graphical user interface of fsq ation of the conjuncts the moment we receive the first conjunct being evaluated to false and return false as value of the conjunction. For atomic formulae, the evaluation is a mere look-up to check if the nodes of the structure as given by the variable assignment do stand in the relation that is expressed by the formula. All in all, the evaluation process follows the definition of the semantics rather closely. Each tree is checked separately, and those trees for which the query evaluates to true are returned as answers to the query. 3.3 The Graphical User Interface The graphical user interface is designed to assist the user in formulating a query by supporting him to compose formulae in a bottom-up fashion.","The centre of the interface (see Figure 2) consists of a list of formulae that the user can manipulate. To pose a query, the user selects one of these formulae and clicks the Submit button. Thereafter, the result set in the form of the numbers of those trees for which the query is true can be browsed by pressing the Result button. It is in-tended that the user feeds this result set into tools like Annotate (Plaehn and Brants, 2000) that allow a detailed inspection of the results.","When composing a query most users think in a bottom-up fashion focusing first on the atomic constituents. This approach is systematically supported by the user interface in the following way. The Atomic menu lets the user compose atomic formulae. He picks the relation of his choice, say, e.g., the dominance relation. He is successively asked for names of the variables one dominating the other, say, e.g., x and y. Thereafter, the syntactically correct formula ( >> x y) is added to the list of formulae as the topmost element. The other atomic formulae can be constructed in a similar fashion.","In order to get more complex formulae, the user can choose operations from the Complex menu. It contains menu options for the boolean connectives and quantifiers. To compose, e.g., a conjunction, the user first chooses the formulae he wishes to conjoin by clicking on them in the list of formulae. Thereafter he just picks the Conjunction menu item and the conjunction of the formulae he chose is added to the list of formulae as the topmost element. In case of an existential or universal quantification, the user selects a formula from the list, say, e.g., ( >> x y) and, e.g., the Existential Quantification menu item. He will be asked for the name of the variable to quantify over, say x, and the existentially quantified formula, (E x (» x y) ), is added to the list of formulae as the topmost element.","The Form menu offers additional operations on formulae. The user can edit a formula by hand, or enter a new one by hand He can duplicate or delete a formula from the list. Or he can swap the order of two formulae on the list.","The File menu offers the ability to save the current list of formulae for further use or to load a list of formulae saved as a file.","The user also has to choose a corpus, not just compose a query. This step is supported by a file chooser that starts when clicking the word Cotpus and offers only corpora precompiled for fsq.","The refinement checkbox to the right of the chosen corpus field helps the user in narrowing in search results. If checked, the next query will not be executed on the whole corpus chosen but rather on the previous search result for that corpus. Thus the user can first pose an approximat-ing query, inspect the result and then formulate a more fine grained query to be executed only on the result of the first query to get a smaller answer set. Of course these steps can be iterated."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["In recent times, a number of query tools for syntactically annotated corpora have been proposed.

The query language allows to query these structures using full first-order quantification. Hence, fsq seems one of the most powerful query system for annotated corpora currently existing. fsq is publicly available, see http: //t cl . sfs .urn -","tuebingen. de/ fsq. 185","The two main directions of extensions are the query language and the corpus input formats fsq can cope with. Although first-order logic is quite an expressive language, there are well-known restrictions. It may therefore be worthwhile to consider (fragments of) second-order logic as query language. Second order quantification allows to define new relations not contained in the signature such as transitive closure of a relation. Another extension of the query language can be a simplified syntax for simple queries without complex quantification to make the tool easier usable for linguists with less experience in formal logics.","The extension to other corpus input formats is of course an important step to increase usability of the tool. We therefore intend to extend fsq to cope with corpora in the Penn Treebank format and certain formats in XML. The main work for such an extension lies in extending the initialisation component.
