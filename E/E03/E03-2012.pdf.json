The system assists in the retrieval of English and German medical scientific abstracts relevant to a German query document (electronic patient record). The modularity of the system allows for deployment in other domains, given appropriate linguistic and semantic resources."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The task of a cross-language information retrieval (CUR) system is to match user queries specified in one language against documents written in a different language. In recent years, three approaches to the CUR problem have been investigated: query translation, document transla-tion and the use of an interlingua as specified in thesauri and similar semantic resources. The system 2","we describe here (MuchMore*) approaches the CUR task by automatically mapping both the queries and documents into an intermediary 1 The Unified Medical Language System (http://umls.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) integrates information from multiple machine-readable biomedical information sources. 2 The system described here emerged in the context of the MuchMore project in close cooperation between two project partners. It is an integral part of the MuchMore prototype, which integrates additional CUR approaches by other partners. XML-based representation by means of a multilingual medical thesaurus. The controlled vocabulary used, the Metathesaurus (or rather the MeSH3 part of this), is one of the three knowledge sources developed within the UMLS containing semantic information about biomedical concepts, their various names and the specific relationships among them (i.e. broader_term, narrower_term, etc.). In addition we used the UMLS Semantic Network as a further knowledge source, which provides a categorization of the Metathesaurus concepts in semantic types and provides links between these types through relationships that are important for the biomedical domain (i.e. location_of, leads_to, etc.)."]},{"title":"2 The MuchMore* Platform","paragraphs":["At its core, MuchMore* is a multitier application configured as a client tier to provide a user interface, a middle tier annotation module that gener-Figure 1. System Architecture 3 MeSH: Medical Subject Headings (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) 231 ates the intermediary data representation, and a back-end tier consisting of a search engine system to provide the retrieval technology (see Figure 1.)."]},{"title":"2.1 Query and Document Annotation","paragraphs":["The middle tier annotation module consists of more subtiers representing an advanced annotation system that automatically identifies a number of relevant linguistic and semantic features. Components for part-of-speech tagging (Brants, 2000), morphological analysis (Petitpierre and Russell., 1995), phrase tagging (chunking) (Skut and Brants., 1998), concept and semantic relations annotation are being loosely integrated, through input-output markup interfaces, and generate an intermediary XML representation (Vintar et al., 2001) of the input data (see Figure 2.).","Semantic annotation represents the primary information that the retrieval system is using. Crossing the language barrier from a query in one language to the document collection in another language is done via concept codes as an interlingua representation. The multilingual entries for UMLS concepts make possible the mapping of lexical items to an intermediate representation (concept codes) to bridge the gap between different languages. For example, the German word 'Herzinfarkt' in a query will be mapped to the same UMLS code as the English word 'myocardial infarction in the documents.","The loose integration of the abovementioned components, through their ability to both produce and consume XML data, is an extremely flexible way for reuse. Through substitution or further chaining of such components the annotation can be extended to embrace a diverse set of domains beside the medical one."]},{"title":"2.2 Query Processing","paragraphs":["The entry point to the MuchMore* system is a query-processing interface that provides a user interface for completing or refining query construction (see Figure 3).

Furthermore, on clicking the frequency number associated with a concept, all its instances in the query are highlighted. Thereby the user is not only presented with a normalized medical terminology, according to the controlled vocabulary, but he can also inspect which terms in the query document are instances of which concepts.

It allows to index any linguistic or semantic feature from the intermediary XML document representation. All content words of the documents are indexed as word forms and as base forms (lemmas), whereby, for compounds, base forms are being computed by segmenting them into single words (e.g. Nociceptilspiegel"]},{"title":"4","paragraphs":["Nociceptin, Spiegel). In addition all semantic codes (MeSH and UMLS codes as well as semantic relations) are indexed in separate classes. Information relevant to a user query is being retrieved through a vector space similarity match between words, concepts and semantic relations on the query and document side. Evidence from multiple indexing features are automatically combined into the computation of the relevancy value for each document.","The result page displays a list of relevant documents in a descending order and a list of concepts and semantic relations that the query consists of. For viewing the content of any retrieved document, a user interface similar to the query processing's view has been implemented, whereby the matched concepts and relations are being highlighted.","As one of the goals of the project is to compare the performance of different document retrieval methods, the system allows for switching between the semantic retrieval engine presented above and other retrieval engines developed in the context of the project by other partners. Furthermore, a meta-search option allows the end user to query a combination of the available retrieval engines by merging different scoring schemes in one unified result list with the most relevant documents ranked topmost."]},{"title":"3 Future Work","paragraphs":["A next release of the system will add functionality with respect to the following topics: • Sense Disambiguation and • Relation Filtering Sense Disambiguation Ambiguity is one of the inherent problems to deal with in the context of semantic annotation. The problem is that a word or even a complex term may have different meanings, i.e. concepts to be annotated with. The system will therefore be extended with a sense disambiguation component in the middle tier to tackle this problem. This component will choose, the most appropriate UMLS concept for a term according to the context. Relation Filtering Given the UMLS Semantic Network, relations can also be ambiguous. That is, two concepts can be related in several ways as illustrated by the following example: Diagnostic Procedure analyzes Antibiotic Diagnostic Procedure measures Antibiotic Diagnostic Procedure uses Antibiotic For this purpose, a relation-filtering component will be added that selects the correct relation by means of lexical markers, such as verbs, and by a measure of context relevancy."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Brants, Thorsten. 2000.
