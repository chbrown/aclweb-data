Fragments include, for instance, subtrees of depth 1 (corresponding to context-free rules) as well as entire trees.","To appreciate these innovations, it should be noted that the model was radically different from all other statistical parsing models at the time. Other models started off with a predefined grammar and used a corpus only for estimating the rule probabilities (as e.g. in Fujisaki et al. 1989; Black et al. 1992, 1993; Briscoe and I Thanks to Ivan Sag for this pun. Waegner 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992). The DOP model, on the other hand, was the first model (to the best of our knowledge) that proposed not to train a predefined grammar on a corpus, but to directly use corpus fragments as a grammar. This approach has now gained wide usage, as exemplified by the work of Collins (1996, 1999), Charniak (1996, 1997), Johnson (1998), Chiang (2000), and many others.","The other innovation of DOP was to take (in principle) all corpus fragments, of any size, rather than a small subset. This innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with local trees, i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation, or with restricted fragments, as in Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes 1992; Chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments. However, during the last few years we can observe a shift towards using more and larger corpus fragments with fewer restrictions. While the models of Collins (1996) and Eisner (1996) restricted the fragments to the locality of head-words, later models showed the importance of including context from higher nodes in the tree (Charniak 1997; Johnson 1998a). The importance of including nonhead-words has become uncontroversial (e.g. Collins 1999; Charniak 2000; Goodman 1998). And Collins (2000) argues for \"keeping track of counts of arbitrary fragments within parse trees\", which has indeed been carried out in Collins and Duffy (2002) who use exactly the same set of (all) tree fragments as proposed in Bod (1992).","Thus the major innovations of DOP are:","1. the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, 19","2. the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones Both have gained or are gaining wide usage, and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics (see Bod et al. 2003a)."]},{"title":"1.2 DOP1 in Retrospective","paragraphs":["One instantiation of DOP which has received considerable interest is the model known as DOP1 2 (Bod 1992). DOP1 combines subtrees from a treebank by means of node-substitution and computes the probability of a tree from the normalized frequencies of the subtrees (see Section 2 for a full definition). Bod (1993) showed how standard parsing techniques can be applied to DOP1 by converting subtrees into rules. However, the problem of computing the most probable parse turns out to be NP-hard (Sima'an 1996), mainly because the same parse tree can be generated by exponentially many derivations. Many implementations of DOP1 therefore estimate the most probable parse by Monte Carlo techniques (Bod 1998; Chappelier & Rajman 2000), or by Viterbi n-best search (Bod 2001), or by restricting the set of subtrees (Sima'an 1999; Chappelier et al. 2002). Sima'an (1995) gave an efficient algorithm for computing the parse tree generated by the most probable derivation, which in some cases is a reasonable approximation of the most probable parse.","Goodman (1996, 1998) developed a polynomial time PCFG-reduction of DOP1 whose size is linear in the size of the training set, thus converting the exponential number of subtrees to a compact grammar. While Goodman's method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse in DOP1, it does efficiently compute the \"maximum constituents parse\", i.e. the parse tree which is most likely to have the largest number of correct constituents.","Johnson (1998b, 2002) showed that DOP1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent. Bod (2000a) solved this problem by training the subtree probabilities by a 2 See Bod et al. (2003b) for an overview and history of other DOP models. maximum likelihood procedure based on Expectation-Maximization. This resulted in a statistically consistent model dubbed ML-DOP. However, ML-DOP suffers from overlearning if the subtrees are trained on the same treebank trees as they are derived from. Cross-validation is needed to avoid this problem. But even with cross-validation, ML-DOP is outperformed by the much simpler DOP1 model on both the ATIS and OVIS treebanks (Bod 2000b).","Bonnema et al. (1999) observed that another problem with DOP1's subtree-estimation method is that it provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees, and therefore more probability to larger subtrees. As an alternative, Bonnema et al. (1999) propose a subtree estimator which reduces the probability of a tree by a factor of two for each non-root non-terminal it contains. Bod (2001) used an alternative technique which samples a fixed number of subtrees of each depth and which has the effect of assigning roughly equal weight to each node in the training data. Although Bod's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task, the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (Bod 2003).","Collins & Duffy (2002) showed how the perceptron algorithm can be used to efficiently compute the best parse with DOP1's subtrees, reporting a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model in Collins (1999) on the WSJ. Goodman (2002) furthermore showed how Bonnema et al.'s (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators can be incorporated in his PCFG-reduction, but did not report any experiments with these reductions.","This paper presents the first published results with Goodman's PCFG-reductions of both Bonnema et al.'s (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators on the WSJ. We show that these PCFG-reductions result in a 60 times speedup in processing time w.r.t. Bod (2001, 2003). But while Bod's estimator obtains state-of-the-art results on the WSJ, comparable to Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000), Bonnema et al.'s estimator performs worse and is comparable to Collins (1996).","In the second part of this paper, we extend our experiments with a new notion of the best parse tree. Most previous notions of best parse tree in 20 DOP1 were based on a probabilistic metric, with Bod (2000b) as a notable exception, who used a simplicity metric based on the shortest derivation. We show that a combination of a probabilistic and a simplicity metric, which chooses the simplest parse from the n likeliest parses, outperforms the use of these metrics alone. Compared to Bod (2001), our results show an 11% improvement in terms of relative error reduction and a speedup which reduces the processing time from 220 to 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence."]},{"title":"2 PCFG-Reductions of DOP 2.1 Formal Specification of DOP1","paragraphs":["DOP1 parses new input by combining treebank-subtrees by means of a leftmost node-subsitution operation, indicated as 0.

A disadvantage of this model is that an extremely large number of subtrees (and derivations) must be taken into account. Fortunately, there exists a compact PCFG-reduction of DOP1 that generates the same trees with the same probabilities, as shown by Goodman (1996, 2002). Here we will only sketch this PCFG-reduction, which is heavily based on Goodman (2002).","Goodman assigns every node in every tree a unique number which is called its address. The notation A@k denotes the node at address k where A is the nonterminal labeling that node. A new nonterminal is created for each node in the training data. This nonterminal is called A k. Nonterminals of this form are called \"interior\" nonterminals, while the original nonterminals in the parse trees are called \"exterior\" nontermimals. Let aj represent the number of subtrees headed by the node A@j . Let a represent the number of subtrees headed by nodes with nonterminal A, that is a =Ej aj.","Goodman (1996, 2002) further illustrates this by a node A @j of the following form: A@j B@k C@1 Figure 1. A node A @j To see how many subtrees it has, Goodman first considers the possibilities of the left branch. There are bk non-trivial subtrees headed by B@k, and there is also the trivial case where the left node is simply B. Thus there are bk + 1 different possibilities on the left branch. Similarly, there are ci + 1 possibilities on the right branch. We can create a subtree by choosing any possible left subtree and any possible right subtree. Thus, there are aj= (bk+ 1)(ci + 1) possible subtrees headed by A @j.","Goodman then gives a simple small PCFG with the following property: for every subtree in the training corpus headed by A, the grammar will generate an isomorphic subderivation with probability 1/a. Thus, rather than using the large, explicit DOP1 model, one can also use this small PCFG that generates isomorphic derivations, with identical probabilities. Goodman's construction is — 21 as follows. For the node in figure 1, the following eight PCFG rules are generated, where the number in parentheses following a rule is its probability. A1 —BC Mad A\\tBC (11a) Aj\\tBkC (bklaj) A —> BkC (bkla) Aj\\tBC1 (cilaj) A\\tBC1 (cila) Aj\\tBkCi (bkcilaj) A\\tBkCi (bkcila) Figure 2.

And subderivations headed by A1 with external nonterminals only at the leaves, internal nonterminals elsewhere, have probability"]},{"title":"1/a1","paragraphs":["(Goodman 1996). Goodman's main theorem is that this construction produces PCFG derivations isomorphic to DOP derivations with equal probability. This means that summing up over derivations of a tree in DOP yields the same probability as summing over all the isomorphic derivations in the PCFG.","Note that Goodman's reduction method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse tree of a sentence: there may still be exponentially many derivations generating the same tree. But Goodman shows that with his PCFG-reduction he can efficiently compute the aforementioned maximum constituents parse. Moreover, Goodman's PCFG reduction may also be used to estimate the most probable parse by Viterbi n-best search which computes the n most likely derivations and then sums up the probabilities of the derivations producing the same tree. While Bod (2001) needed to use a very large sample from the WSJ subtrees to do this, Goodman's method can do the same job with a more compact grammar."]},{"title":"2.2 PCFG-Reductions of Bod (2001) and Bonnema et al. (1999)","paragraphs":["DOP1 has a serious bias: its subtree estimator provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees (Bonnema et al. 1999). The amount of probability given to two different training nodes depends on how many subtrees they have, and, given that the number of subtrees is an exponential function, this means that some training nodes could easily get hundreds or thousands of times the weight of others, even if both occur exactly once. Bonnema et al. (1999) show that as a consequence too much weight is given to larger subtrees, and that the parse accuracy of DOP1 deteriorates if (very) large subtrees are included. Although this property may not be very harmful for small corpora with relatively small trees, such as the ATIS, Bonnema et al. give evidence that it leads to severe biases for larger corpora such as the WSJ. There are several ways to fix this problem. For example, Bod (2001) samples a fixed number of subtrees of each depth, which has the effect of assigning roughly equal weight to each node in the training data, and roughly exponentially less probability for larger trees (see Goodman 2002: 12). Bod reports state-of-the-art results with this method, and observes no decrease in parse accuracy when larger subtrees are included (using subtrees up to depth 14). Yet, his grammar contains more than 5 million subtrees and processing times of over 200 seconds per WSJ sentence are reported (Bod 2003).","In this paper, we will test a simple extension of Goodman's compact PCFG-reduction of DOP which has the same property as the normalization proposed in Bod (2001) in that it assigns roughly equal weight to each node in the training data.

We will refer to this model as Simplicity-","DOP. In case the shortest derivation is not unique, Bod (2000b) proposes to back off to a frequency ordering of the subtrees. That is, all subtrees of each root label are assigned a rank according to their frequency in the treebank: the most frequent subtree (or subtrees) of each root label gets rank 1, the second most frequent subtree gets rank 2, etc. Next, the rank of each (shortest) derivation is computed as the sum of the ranks of the subtrees involved. The derivation with the smallest sum, or highest rank, is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in Simplicity-DOP. 3","Although Bod (2000b) reports that Simplicity - DOP is outperformed by Likelihood-DOP, its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model.

As usual, all trees were stripped off their semantic tags, co-reference information and quotation marks. Without loss of generality, all trees were converted to binary branching (and were reconverted to n-ary trees after parsing). We employed the same unknown (category) word model as in Bod (2001), based on statistics on word-endings, hyphenation and capitalization in combination with Good-Turing (Bod 1998: 85 - 87). We used \"evalb\" 4 to compute the standard PARSEVAL scores for our results (Manning & Schiitze 1999).
