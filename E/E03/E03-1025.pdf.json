In this paper, we use GRs to provide a common basis for comparing full and shallow parsers, and Penn Treebank and Susanne structures. To carry out this comparison, we implemented a GR extraction mechanism for Penn Treebank","This work was supported by UK EPSRC project GR/N36462/93 'Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing'. parses. Evaluating parsers using GRs as opposed to crossing brackets or labelled precision/recall metrics can be argued to give a more robust measure of performance (Carroll et al., 1998), (Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002). The main novelty of this paper is the use of the Carroll et al's GR evaluation method to compare the Collins model 1 and model 2, and Charniak parsers.","An initial evaluation is provided by comparing the extracted GRs to a gold standard GR annotation of 500 Susanne sentences due to Carroll et al. To gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the different parsers, we present a breakdown of the results for each type of GR. It is not clear whether the ranking produced from the gold standard evaluation is representative: there may be corpus effects for parsers not trained on Susanne, and real life applications may not reflect this ranking. We therefore perform an experiment using the extracted GRs as input to the Lappin and Leass (1994) anaphora resolution algorithm. This produces a second ranking of the parsers, and we investigate the number of errors that are caused by incorrect GRs.","We describe the parsers and the GR finder in Section 2. We introduce GRs in Section 3 and briefly describe our GR extraction software for Penn Treebank style parses. The evaluation, including a description of the evaluation corpus and performance results, is presented in Section 4.

This work was extended by Carroll et al. (1998), and it is this specification called grammatical relations which we employ in our work. An example, for the sentence John gave Mary the book, can be seen in Figure 1.","Both the Briscoe and Carroll parser and 292 Sentence: John gave Mary the book. Grammatical relations: (ncsubj gave John) (dobj gave Mary) (obj2 gave book) (detmod book the) Figure 1: Sample GR output Buchholz's GR finder already output GRs in the desired format. Although Buchholz's work has focused mainly on extracting relations involving verbs, some non-verb relations (e.g. detmod) are also produced by the chunker she employs (Veenstra and van den Bosch, 2000).","Therefore, to carry out a GR comparison, we need to extract GRs from Penn Treebank style parses. We manually created rules which find the relevant heads and their dependants by traversing the parse tree (for example, the NP in a S NP VP rule gives an instance of the ncsubj relation). In cases where a distinction is difficult/impossible to make from a Penn Treebank tree (e.g. xcomp vs xmod), we sacrificed recall for precision and only encoded rules which cause as few misclassifications as possible. 2","Similar work has been carried out by Blaheta and Charniak (2000) who used statistical methods to add function tags to Penn Treebank I style parses; however, as well as converting the tags into a Carroll et al. for-mat, we would need to add extra rules to extract other GRs needed for our application described in Section 6. E.g. the direct object is not immediately apparent from Penn Treebank II tags.","We restrict the GRs we extract from the Penn Treebank to those that are necessary for the anaphora resolution application (the object relations, the complement relations and the ncmod relation), and those that are a simple by-product of extracting the necessary relations (e.g. aux).","2 These kind of errors caused by the GR extraction rules may be responsible for degraded performance. 4"]},{"title":"Evaluation","paragraphs":["As part of the development of their parser, Carroll et al. have manually annotated 500 sentences with their GRs. 3 The sentences were selected at random from the Susanne corpus subject to the constraint that they are within the coverage of the Briscoe and Carroll parser. 4 We used our own evaluation software which only scores correct an exact match of the output with the gold standard. This has caused some differences in performance with previously published results, for example the Briscoe and Carroll GRs do not produce the expected conjunction in the conj relation, causing the system to score zero.","The results of all systems are presented in Table 3. For each system, we present two figures: precision (the number of instances of this GR the system correctly annotated divided by the number of instances labelled as this GR by the system), and recall (the number of instances of this GR the system correctly annotated divided by the number of instances of this GR in the corpus). In the #occs column of the table, we also present the number of occurrences of each GR in the 500 sentence corpus. A dash (—) indicates that a certain GR annotation was not present in the answer corpus at al1. 5 We also show the mean it precision and recall for each system, and the weighted mean itw, where precision and recall values are weighted by the number of occurrences of each GR.","To obtain a ranking of the parsers, we compare F1 using the t-test. The 500 sentence corpus is split into 10 segments and an F-measure is computed for each algorithm on all segments. These are then compared using the t-test. The results are presented in Table 4, which is to be interpreted as follows:","3 Available from http: //www. cogs. susx. ac .uk/ lab/nlp/carroll/greval .html","4 The parser has a coverage of about 74% on Susanne.","5 Note that we currently do not extract cmod, conj, csubj, mod, subj, xmod or xsubj from Penn Treebank parses.

The number of times that only one antecedent exists in the suggested answers is strikingly high. However, this may be slightly misleading, as a chosen pronominal antecedent (e.g. in Mary... She i . She2 , She 2 will resolve to She') counts as identical whether or not it refers to the same entity. In scoring the anaphora resolution, if Shei was previously wrongly resolved, She2 is also treated as an error.

This is an interesting result, which shows that accurate GRs can be obtained without the expense of constructing a full parse. The ranking between the Penn Treebank parsers obtained from the GR evaluation reflects the ranking obtained from a direct parser comparison (from Table 1).","In the task-based evaluation, the performance gap between the anaphora resolution algorithm using the various parsers narrowed. This may be due to the anaphora resolution algorithm making use of only certain instances of GRs which are 'equally difficult' for all parsers to extract.","We expect the results of the anaphora res-297 olution experiment to be typical of parser applications that make use of a large number of types of GRs.
