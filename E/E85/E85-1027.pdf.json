Pnstejovsky","Department of Computer and Information Science University of M~,=.~chnsetts at Amherst 1. Abstract","In this paper we report on initial research we have conducted on a computational theory of prose style. Our theory speaks to the following major points:","1. Where in the generation process style is taken into account.","2. How a particular prose style is represented; what \"stylistic rules\" look like;","3. What modifications to a generation algorithm are needed; what the deci~'on is that evaluates stylistic alternatives;","4. What elaborations to the normal description of surface structure are necessary to make it usable as a plan for the text and a referenco for these decicions;","5. What kinds of information decisions about style have access to.","Our theory emerged out of design experiments we have made over the past year with our natural language generation system, the Zetalisp program MUMBLE. In the process we have extended MUMBLE through the addition of an additional process that now mediates between content planning and linguistic realization. This new process, which we call \"attachment\", provides the further si~,nificant benefit that text structure is no longer dictated by the structure of the message: the sequential order and dominance relationships of concepts in the memage no longer force one form onto the words and ph~ in the text. Instead, rhetorical and intentional directives can be interpreted flexibly in the context of the ongoing discour~ and stylistic preferences. The text is built up through compos/tion under the direction of Linguistic organly/nS principles, rather than having to follow conceptual principles in Iockstep.","We will begin by describing what we mean by prose style and then introducing the generation task that lead us to this theory, the reproduction of short encyclopedia articles on African tribes. We will then use that task to outline the parts of our theory and the operations of the attachment process. Finally we will compare our techniques to the related work of Davey, McKeown and Derr, and Gabriel, and consider some of the possible psychollnguistic hypotheses that it may lead to. 2. Prose Style","Style is an intuitive notion involving the manner in which something is said. It has been more often the professional domain of literary critics and English teachers than linguists, which is entirely reasonable given that it involves optional, often conscious decb/ons and preferences rather than the unconscious, inviolable rules that linguists term Universal Grammar.","To illustrate what we mean by style, cons/der the three paragraphs in Figure 1. As we see it, the first two of these have the same style, and the third has a different one. The Ibibio are a group of six related peoples riving in southeastern Nigeria. They have a population estimated at 1,500,1300, and speak a language in the Benue-Niger subfamily of the Niger-Congo languages. Most Ibibio are subsistence farmers, but two subgroups are fishermen. The Ashanti are an AKAN-speaking people of central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast, numbering more than 900,000. They subsist primarily by farming cacao, a major cash crop. The Ashanti are an African people. They live in central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast. Their population is more than 9(}0,000. They speak the language Akan. They subsist primarily by farming cacao. Thb is a major cash crop. 1 ~ paragraphs, two styles 187","The first two of these paragraphs are extracted from the Academic American Encyclopedia; they are the lead paragraphs from the two articles on those respective tribes. The third paragraph was written by taking the same information that we have posited underlies the Ashanti paragraph and regenerating from it with an impoverished set of stylistic rules.","We began looking at texts like these during the summer of 1983, as part of the work on the \"Knoesphere Project\" at Atari Research (Borning et al [1983]). Our goal in that project was to develop a representation for the kind of information appearing in encyclopedias which would not be tied to the way in which it would be presented. The same knowledge base objects were to be used whether one WaS recreating an article llke the or/giuaJ, or wakin~g a simpler version to give to children, or answering isolated questions about the material, or giving an interactive multi-media presentation coordinated with maps and icons, and so on.","With the demise of Atari Research, this ambitious goal has had to be put on the shelf; we have, however, continued to work with the articles on our own. Research on these articles lead us to begin work on p~o.~ style. This remains an interesting domain in which to explore style since we are working with a body of texts whose organization is not totally dictated by its internal form.","These paragraphs are representative of all the African tribe articles in the Academic American, which is not surprising since all of the articles were written by the same person and under tight editorial control. What was most striking to us when we first looked at these articles was their similarity to each other, both in the information they contained and the way they were muctured as a text. We will assume that for such texts, ~encyclopedia style\" involves at least the following two generalizations: (1) be consistent ia the reformation that you provide about each tribe; and (2) adopt a complex, \"information loaded\" sentence structure in your presentation. This sentence t~ructure is typified by a rich set of syntactic constructions, including the use of conjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, coordination, secondary adjunction, and prenominal modification whenever possible.","A contrasting style might be, for example, one that was aimed at children; we have rewritten the information on the Ashanti tribe as it might look in such a style. We have not yet tried implementing this ~'71e qince it will call for doing lexicalization under stylistic control, which we have not yet designed. \"The Ashanti are an African people. They live in West Africa in a country called Ghana and in parts of Togo and the"]},{"title":"Ivory","paragraphs":["Coast. There are about 900DO0 people in this tribe, and they speak a language named AKAN. Most of the Ashanti are cacao farmers.\" Figure 2 The style of the Academic American paragraphs, on the other hand, is much tighter, with more compact sentence structure, and a more sophisticated choice of phrasing. Such differences are the son of thing that rules of prose style must capture. 3. Our Theory of Generation","Looking at the generation process as a whole, we have always presumed that it involved three different stages, with our own research concentrating on the last. (1) Deter,-,,,i,.e what goals to (attempt to) accomplish with the utteraaes. This initiates the other activities and posts a set of criteria they are to meet, typically information to be conveyed (e.g. pointers to frames in the knowledge base) and speech acts to be carried out. (2) Deriding which qx.dfle propositions to express and which to leave for the audlcnge to Infer on their own. This cannot be separated from working out what rhetorical constructions to employ in expressing the specified speech ace; or from selecting the key lexical items for communicating the propositions. The result of this activity is a teat plan, which has a principally conceptual vocabulary with rhetorical and lexical annotations. The text plan is seen by the next stage as an executable %-pecification\" that is to be incrementally converted into a text. The specification is given in layers, Le. not all of the details are planned at once. Later, once the linguistic context of the uni~ within the s]~t'ication has been determined, this planner will be recunively invoked, unit by unit, until the planning has been done in enough detail that only linguistic problems remain. (3) ]~fnintJ.lnlna_ • rt~u of the ~ ~tl\"u~ or the uttermuz, traverdng und interpreting thts structure to preduce tim words of tim text and constrain further dee/stun~ This stage is responsible for the grammaticality of the text and its fluency as a discourse (e.g. insuring that the correct terms are pronominalized, the conect focus maintained, etc.). The central representation is an explicit model of the suryace structure of the text being produced, which is used both to determine control flow and to constrain the activities of the other ~ (see discussion in McDonald [1984]). The surface structure is defined in terms of a stream of phrasal nodes, constituent positions, words, and embedded information units (which will eventually have to Le sent back to the planner and then realized linguistically, extending the surface structure in the process). The entities in the stream and their relative order is indelible (i.e. once selected it cannot be changed); however more material can be spficed into the stream at specified points. 3.1 WHERE IS STYLE CONSIDERED?","According to our theory, prose style Is a consequence of what decisions are made darhllg the U'ans/t/ou from the ceueeptmd representationsl level to the linguistic level. The conceptual representation of what is to be mid--the text"]},{"title":"188","paragraphs":["plan--is modeled as a stream of information units selected by the content planning component. The a:tachmera process takes units from this stream and positions them in the surface structure somewhere ahead of the point of speech.","The prose style one adopts dictates what choice the attachment process makes when faced with alternatives in where to position a unit: should one extend a sentence with a nonrestrictive relative clause or start a new one; express modification with an prenominal adjective or a postnominal prepositional phrase. The collective pattern of such decisions is the compotational manifestation of one's style. 3.2 EXTENSIONS TO THE SURFACE STRUCTURE REPRESENTATION","The information units from the text plan are pos/tioned at one or another of the predefmed \"attachment points\" in the surface structure. These points are defined on structural grounds by a grammar, and annotated according to the rhetorical uses they can be put to (see later example in Figure 8). They define the grammatically legitimate ways that the surface structure might be extended: another adjective added to a certain noun phrase, a temporal adjunct added to a clause, another sentence add,~cl tO a paragraph, and so on.","Which attachment points exist at any moment is a function of the surface structure's configuration at that moment and where the point of speech is. Since the configuration changes as units are added to the surface structure or already positioned units are realized, the set of available attachment points changes as well This is accomplished by including the points in the definitions of the phrasal elements from which the mrface structure is built. We have since argued that this addition of attachment point specifications to elementary trees is very similar to the grammatical formalism used in Tree Adjoining Grammars [Joshi 1983] and are actively exploring the relationships between the two theories (cf. McDonald & Pustejovsky [1985a].) 3.3 A DECISION PROCEDURE","The job of the attachment process is to decide which of the available attachment points it should use in positioning a text plan unit in the s~'face structure. This decision is a function of three kinds of things:","1. The different ways that the unit can be realized in English, e.g. most adjectives can also be couched as relative clauses, not all full clauses can be reduced to participial adjectives.","2. The characteristics of the available attachment points, especiafly the grammatical constraints that they would impose on the realization of any unit using them. The \"new sentence\" attachment will require that the unit be expressible as a clause and rule out one that could only be re.afized as a aoua phrase; attachment as the head of a noun phrase would impose just the opposite constraint.","3. What stylistic rules have been def'med and the predicates they apply to determine their applicability.","The algorithm goes as follows. The units in the stream from the text plan are considered one at a time in the order that they appear. There is no buffeting of unpce/tioned units and no Iookahead down the stream to look for patterns among the units; any patterns that might be ~gnificant are supposed to already have been seen by the text planner and indicated by passing down composite units, t Each unit is thus considered on its own, on the basis of how it can be realized.","The total set of alternative phrasings for an information unit are prccomputed and stored within the linguistic component (i.e the third stage of the process) as a \"real/z~tion class ~. Different choices of syntactic arrangement, optional arguments, idiomatic wordings, etc. are anticipated before hand (by the linguist, not the program) and grouped together along with characteri~ics that describe the uses to which the different choices can be put: which choice focuses which argument; which one presumes that the audience will already understand a certain relationship, which one not. (Realization classes are discussed at greater length in McDonald & Pustejovsky"]},{"title":"[19ssbV.","paragraphs":["The tint step in the attachment algorithm is to compote all legitimate pairings of attachment points and choices in the unit's realization dam, e,g. a unit might be attached at a NP premodifier point using its adjective realization; or as postmodifier using its participial realization; or as the next sentence in the paragraph using any of its several realizations as a root clause. This particular case is the one in our example in Section 4.","The characteristics on each of the active attachment points will be compared with the characteristics on each of the choices in the unit's realization class. Any choice that is compatible with a given attachment point is grouped with it in a set; if that attachment point is selected, a later decision will be made among the choices in that set.","Once the attachment point/choice set pairs have been computed, the next step is to order them according to which is most consistent with the present prose style. This is where the stylistic rules are employed. Once the pairs are ordered, we select the pair judged to be the best and use it. The unit is spliced into the surface structure at the selected attachment point, and the choices consistent with","1 Assumi~ that the critcrial division between conccptuaVrhctorical plsaaias sad fin~,~c realization is that only the linguistic ~dc t//]~a '4. gl'smmsg, ¢~. the opporttm~tJcs god COIISU'&IOLq impfic~t the surface structurc at • give~ moment (we th~nk that both sides should be dcsipcd to appreciate the lexicon), then this restriction implim that therc will be no opportunistic reconflg~g of the text plan by tl~ lingui~c component, no condensing parallel predicat~ into conjunctions or grouping of modifiers etc. unkm there is a specifically pbnncd rhetorical motive for doing ~ dictated by the planner."]},{"title":"189","paragraphs":["that point set up for later seloction (realization of the unit) once that point it reached by the linguistic component in its traversal."]},{"title":"3.4 STYLISTIC RULES","paragraphs":["As we have just said, the computational job of a stylistic rule it to identify preferences among attachment points. 2 This means that the rides themselves can have a very simple structure. Each rule has the following three parts:","I. A name. This symbol is for the conven/ence of the human designer; it does not take part in the computation. 2. An ordered list of attachment points.","3. A predicate that can be evaluated in the environment accesdble within the attachment process. If the predicate it satisfied, the rule it applicable.","Each stylistic rule states a preference between specific attachment points, as given by the ordering it defines. To perform the sorting then, one performs a fairly simple calculation (n.b. it it simple but lengthy; see footnote).","(1) For each candidate attachment point, collect all of the stylistic rules that mention it in their ordered lists; discard any rules that do not mention at least one of the other candidate points as well.","(2) Evaluate the applicability predicates of the collected rules and discard any that fail.","(3) Using the rule, that remain, sort the list of candidate attachment point, so that its order matches the partial orders defined by the individual stylistic rule,..","'~:. have now looked at our treatment of four of the five points which we said at the onset of this paper had to b,~ considered by any theory of prose style.

The point here, however, is to examine a simple planning domain in order to isolate those decisions that axe purely stylistic in nature. 4.2 Attaehmellg","TO illustrate what attachment adds, let us tint look what the usual alternative procedure, direct trandat/on, 4 would do with the information plan we use for these paragraphs. It would realize the items in the script one by one, maintaining the given order, and the resulting text would look like this (assuming the system had a reasonable command of pronominalization):","The Ashanti are an African people.

Figure 5 Paragraph II by Direct Replacement","Although true to th© information in the script, this method does not refiet.t the complex stylistic variations and enrichments that make up the original paragraph. There must be something above the level of a single information unit to coordinate the flow of text, while not altering the intentions or goals of the planner. With this in mind, we have built a stylistic controller which has the following properties:","o It allows information to be \"folded in\" to already planned text. Items in the script do not necessarily appear in the same order in the text.","o The decision about when to fold things in is made on the barn of style; i.e. if the style had been different, the text would have been different as well.","o The points where new material may be added to planned text are defined on structural grounds.","For example, notice that in paragraph 1I from Figure I the language-field is realized as as a compound adjectival phrase, modifying the prototype; viz. \"Akan-speaking.\" For the first article, however, the language-field is realized differently. The attachment-point that allows this \"fold-in\" (i.e. attach-as-adjective) is introduced by the realization class for the prototype field. The decision to select this phrase over the sentential form in Figure 5 is made by a styllst/e rule. This rule (cf. Figure 6) states that the adjectival form is preferred if the language name has its own encyclopedia entry. 5 We see that this stylistic rule is no* satisfied in Paragraph I, hence another avenue must be taken (namely, clausal). The other attachment points used by the stylistic rules determine whether to use a reduced relative clause, a new sentence, or perhaps an ellipsed phrase. The stylistic rule allowing this structure is given below in Figure 6.","(deflne-styCstJc-nJe PRE FER-NO UN-ADJ-COMPOUND-TO- POSTNOM o~n-atlachrnent-polnts","( attach-as-ad~ctJve attach-as-~prr~se ) a,opllcabUJty-co ndP, Jon","(encyCopeda-emry't Noun) )","(deflne-sty~stlc-n~ PREFER-ADJECTIVES-TO-NEW-SENTENCE o~n-aP.achment-polnts","(aUa~as-~jectlve attach.as-new-sentence ) appll~lblUly-~n(~Jon Of (Ir~____rP~_ at~.,hment.polnt \"attach-as-adlec~e","(not (or (wUl-be.complex-adjec~e..phrase (mable-cmJces \"aua~as-acr~e)) (too-h~w-wlth-adjectlvus (r~-be~-attac,~,~--to \"eeam-aa-ezr~-~e)))))) Figure 6 StTllst/¢ Rules","Condder now the derivation of the first sentence of Paragraph I, and how the stylistic rules constrain the attachment process.

Use of a restrictive relative, on the other hand, is not a matter of style, but of interpretation; \"the man who owns a donkey\" is not a stylistic variant of the proposition \"The man owns a donkey.\" In other words, the stylLqic component has no reference to intentions, goals, focus, etc. 192 These are the concerns of the planner, and are expressed in its choices of information units and their description (cf.
