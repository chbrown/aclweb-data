For other purposes, such as that of full natural language comprehension, it is necessary to go as far as the semantic (truth- -conditional) i~terpretation, using a notation that includes variables, operators, parentheses and similar means.","The topic-focus articulation (TFA) is understood as one of the hierarchies of the level of meaning, whose other two hierarchies are that of dependency syntax (close to case grammar) and that of coordination (and apposition) relations. The basic task of a description of TPA is to handle the differences between such sentences as John gave Mary a BOOK. John ~ave a book to ~t%RY. It was ~RY John nave a book.

It has been found (HajiEov~ and Sgall, 1980 and the writings quoted there) that the scale of CD coincides to a great part with Chomsky (1971) calls \"the range of permissible focus\".","With the elements belonging to the focus the scale of CD is determined by the kinds of complementation (deep cases~ the order always being in accordance with what we call systemic ordering; for the main participan%s of the verb in 264 English this ordering is Time - Actor - - Addressee - Objective - Origin - Effect - Manner - Instrument - Locative (see Seidlov~, 1983). The scale of CD differs from this ordering only if at least one of the elements in question belongs to the topic (this is true about the Addressee in (10)(b),about the Origin in (11)(b), and about the Effect in 412) (b) below):","(10)(a) I gave several children a few","APPLES.","(b) I gave a few apples to several","CHILDREN.","(11)(a) John made a canoe out of","a LOG.","(b) John made a CANOE out of","a log.","(12)(a) John made a log into a CANOE.","(b) It was a LOG John made into","a canoe.","Thus, in the (b) sentences a few apples, ~ and a canoe are contextually bound, standing close to a few of those","one of the lo~s, the canoe we","bout, respectively. In the (a) examples the rightmost complementations belong to the focus (they carry the intonation center), while the complementations standing between them and the verb are ambiguous in this respect: in some meanings of the sentence they are contextually bound and belong to the focus; a similar ambiguity concerns also the verbs in all the examples.","Systemic ordering is language specific; Czech differs from English e.g. in that it has Time after Actor and Object after Instrument; for more details, see Sgall, Haji~ov~ and Panevov~ (in press, Chapter 3).","3.1 Pot an automatic recognition of topic, focus and the degrees of CD, two points are crucial:","(A) Either the input is spoken discourse (and the recognition procedure in-cl~des an acoustic analysis), or written (printed) texts are analyzed.","(B) Either the input language has (a considerable degree of the so-called free word order (as in Czech, Russian), or its word order is determined ma~n!y by the grammatical relations (as in English, Prench).","Since written texts do not indicate the position of the intonation center and since the \"free\" word order is determined first of all by the scale of CD, it is",",! ,, evident that the either cases in (A) and (B) do not present so many difficulties for the recognition procedure as the \"or\" cases do.","A written \"sentence\" corresponds, in general, to several spoken sentences which differ in the placement of their intonation center. Thus, I/ an adverbial of time or of place stands at the end of the sentence, as in (13), then at least two sentences may be present, see (14)(a) and (b), where the intonation center is marked by the capitals;the TFA clearly differs:","(13) We were swimming in the pool in","the afternoon.","(14)(a) We were swimming in the pool","in the AFTERNOON.","(b) We were swimming in the POOL","in the afternoon.","In languages with the so-called free word order this fact does not bring about serious complications with technical texts, since there is a strong tendency to arrA-ge the words so that the i~tona-tion center falls on the last word of the sentence (if this is not enclitical).","3.2 A procedure for the identification of topic and focus in Czech written (first of all technical) texts can then","I be formulated as follows:","(i)(a) If the verb is the last word","of the surface shape of the","sentence (SS), it always be-","longs to the focus.","(b) If the verb is not the last","word of the SS, it belongs","either to the topic, or to the","fOCUS. Note: The ambiguity accounted for by the rule (i)(b) can be partially resolved (asp. f?r the purposes of practical systems) on the basis of the features of the preceding sentence: if the verb ¥ of the analyzed sentence is identical with the verb of the preceding sentence, or if a relation of synonymy or inclusion holds between the two verbs, then V belongs to the topic. Also, a semantically weak, general verb, such as to be, to become, to carry out, can-Y~derstood","as belonging to the topic. In other cases the primary position of the verb is in the focus.","(ii) The complementations preceding","the verb are included in the","topic.","(iii) As for the complementations fol-","lowing the verb, the boundary","IThe term oomplementation (sentence part) is used in the sense of a subtree occupying the position of a deep case or an adverbial. - We disregard the so-call-ed subjective order here, since Gin contrast to English) in a Czech written technical text such sentences as The SWITCH was off are extremely rare. 265","between topic (to the left) and","focus (to the right) may be","drawn between any two complemen-","rations, provided that those be-","longing to the focus are arrang-","ed in the surface word order in","accordance with the systemic","order~.","(iv) If the sentence contains","a rhematizer (such as even,","also, only), then in tHeprimary","~-~ the ~omplementation follow-","ing the rhematizer belongs to the","focus and the rest of the sent-","ence belongs to the topic. 2","3.22 Similar regularities hold for the","analysis of spoken sentences with normal","intonation. However, if a non-flnal","complementation carries the intonation","center (IC), then","(a) the bearer of the IC belongs to the focus and all the complementations standing after IC belong to the topic;","(b) rules (ii) and (iii) apply for the elements stand~-g before the bearer of the intonation center~","(c) the rule (i)(b) is applied to the verb (if it does not carry the IC). 3","3.31 As for the identification of","topic and focus in an English written","sentence, the situation is more complic-","ated due to the fact that the surface","word order is to a great extent determin-","ed by rules of grammar, so that intona-","tion plays a more substantial role and","the written form of the sentence displays","much richer ambiguity. Por English texts","from polytecbn~cal and scientific domains","the rules stated for Czech in 3.21 should","be modified in the following ways:","(i)(a) holds the surface subject","of the sentence is a definite","NP; if the subject noun has |","2This concerns such sentences as Here even a device of the first type can e~ used; in a secondary case the rhematizer may occur in the topic, e.g. if the sentence part in its scope is repeated from the preceding co-text.","3However, an analysis of spoken discourse should pay due respect not only to the preceding co-text, but also to the situation of the utterance, i.e. to its context in the broader sense.","an indefinite article, then","the subject mostly belongs te","the focus, and the verb to the r","topic; however, marginal cases","with both subject and verb in","the focus, or with subject","(though indefinite) in the","topic and the verb in the","focus are not excluded} (i)(b) holds, including the rules of","thumb contained in the note) (ii) holds, only the surface sub-","~ect and a temporal adverbial","can belong to the focus, if","they do not.have the form of","definite NP s~ (iii) holds, with the following","modifications: (a) If the rlghtmost complementation","is a local or temporal adverbial, then","it should be checked whether its lexical","meaning is specific (its bein~","a proper name, a narrower term,or a term","not a belongin~ to the sub~ect domain of","the given text)or general (a pronoun,","a broader term); in the former case it is","probable that the adverbial bears IC and","belongs to the focus, as in (15) and (16)","while in the latter case it rather be-","longs to the topic, as in (17) or (18),","where the word method probably carries","the IC~ (15) Several teams carried out","experiments with this method","during a single week.

(b) If the verb is followed by more","than one complementation and if the","sentence final position is occupied by","a definite NP or a pronoun, this right-","most complementation probably is not the","bearer of IC and it thus belongs to the","topic. (c) If (a) or (b) apply, then it is","also checked which pair of complement-","ations disagreeing in their word order","with their places under systemic order-","ing is closest (from the left) to IC i.e. to the end of the focus)i the","boundary between the (left-hand part of","the) topic and the focus can then be","drawn between any two complementations","beginning with the given pair. 3.32 If a spoken sentence of English","is analyzed, the position of IC can be","determined more safely, so that it is","easier to identify the end of the focus","than with written sentences and the 266 modifications to rule (lii) are no longer necessary. The procedure can be based on the regularities stated in 3.22.","4. Whenever the preceding context can be taken into account in the analysis, the salient (activated) items (see HaJi~ov~ and Vrbov~, 1982) should be registered. A \"pushdown\" principle can be used: the item mentioned as the (last part of the) focus of the last utterance is the most salient in the given time- -point of the discourse, while the elements that were mentioned in other positions of this utterance get a lower status in the activated part of the stock of shared knowledge, and those that have not been mentioned in one or several subsequent utterances may fade away (if they do not have a specific position of a \"hypertopic\", which concerns e.g. those mentioned in a heading). Thus it can be decided in some of the unclear cases (e.g. with temporal adverbials, see point (iii) in 3.31) whether a complementation belongs to the topic or to the focus. This method has its limits: the set of activated items should include not only items mentioned in the text, but also their parts, counterparts and other items connected with them by associative relations; on the other side, if a specific kind of contrast is involv-ed, it is possible that also an item included in this set is mentioned as a part of the focus of the next utterance.","5. A procedure of automatic identification of topic and focus has been in-corporated, to a certain degree, in the parser for Czech implemented in Colmerauer s Q-language on EC-I040 (compatible with IBM 360) and briefly described by Panevov~ and Sgall (1980), Panevov~ and Oliva (1982). The prototypical cases of topic-focus articulation are also cover-ed by the English parser designed and implemented (using the same programming to-ols and hardware) by Kirschner (1982) as a part of the Engllsh-to-Czech machine translation project.","Both parsers account also for more complex sentences than the examples quoted in this summary~ in some such cases there are embedded sentence parts that have (partial) topics and loci of their owD~","Both in translation and comprehension the topic-focus articulation should be paid due respect to, since - as we have seen in Sect. I - it is relevant not only for an appropriate use of a sentence in different contexts, but also for truth- -conditional interpretation, especially of sentences with certain kinds of quantification and with negation.","REFERENCES","Chomsky, N.
