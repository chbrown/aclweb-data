Even such a restricted language analysis is fraught with difficulties because of the well-known problems in the analysis of compound nominals, and the hazards and cost of constructing word synonym classes valid for large text samples.","In this study an extended (soft) Boolean logic is used for the formulation of information retrieval queries which is capable of representing both the use of compound noun phrases as well as the inclusion of synonym constructions in the query statements. The operations of the extended Boolean logic are described, and evaluation output is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended logic compared with that of ordinary text retrieval systems. I. Linguistic Approaches in Information Retrieval","It is possible to classify the various automatic text processing systems by the depth and type of linguistic analysis needed for their operations. Sophisticated language understanding components are believed to be essential to carry out automatic text transformations such as text abstracting and text translation. [I,14,24] Complete language understanding systems are also needed in automatic question-answering where direct responses to user queries are automatically generated by the system. [11] On the other hand, relatively less sophisticated language analysis systems may be adequate for bibliographic information retrieval, where references as opposed to direct answers are retrieved in response to user queries. [21]","In bibllographic retrieval, the content of individual documents is normally represented by sets of key words, or key phrases, and only a few specified term relationships are recognized using Department ot Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853. This study was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant 1ST 83-16166. preconstructed dictionaries or thesauruses. Even in this relatively simplified environment one does not normally undertake a linguistic analysis of any scope. In fact, syntactic and semantic analysis have been used in bibliographic information retrieval only under special circumstances to analyze query phrases [22], to process structured text samples of a certain kind, [7,15], or finally to process texts in severely restricted topic areas."]},{"title":"[2]","paragraphs":["Where special conditions do not obtain, the preferred approach in information retrieval has been to use statistical or probabilistic criteria for the generation of the content identifiers assigned to documents and search queries.

The use of Boolean logic in retrieval is discussed in more detail in the remainder of this note."]},{"title":"116","paragraphs":["2. Extended Boolean Logic in Information Retrieval","It is customary to express information search requests by using Boolean formulas that include the operators and, or, and no~. Of particular interest in a linguistic context are the and and or operators:"]},{"title":"a) b)","paragraphs":["The and-operator is a device for specifying a compulsory phrase where all terms in the and-clause must be present to affect the retrieval operation. Thus a query state-ment such as \"information and retrieval\" is used to represent the compound nominals \"information retrieval\", or \"retrieval of information\". The and-operator is used as a refining device since a broad term such as \"information\" is made more speclflc when it is incorporated in an and-clause. The or-operator, on the other hand, is a device for specifying a group of synonymous terms, or alternatively, a thesaurus class of terms in which all terms are treated as coequal. That is, any one term in an or-clause will cause retrieval of the corresponding document, and each term is assumed to be as good as any other term. The or-operator is a broadening device because each or-clause has a broader scope than any individual clause component.","While the logical operators ,nd and or are used universally in retrieval environments, the assomptions of Boolean logic are not verified in normal text processing enviror..ents. Strict synonyms occur relatively rarely in query formulations or in the texts of documents, so that the nOrmal or-clause does not reflect a practical situation. In fact, it should be possible to make distinctions between more or less important terms in an or-clause; furthermore, or-clauses should be usable to represent collections of loosely related terms instead of only strict synonyms, Analogously, it should be possible to relax the compulsory nature of the phrase components included in an ~&~-clause, and distinctions ought to be introducable between phrase components of greater or lesser importance.","In summary, the uncertain (fuzzy) nature of the term relationships which obtain in the natural language are not reflected by the rules of ordinary Boolean logic. [25] Instead a relaxed type of logic is needed which is capable of broadening or narrowing the term units, while also providing for distinctions in term importance and for the specification of fuzzy or soft term relationships. Such an extended logical system was introduced recently with the following main properties: [17-18]"]},{"title":"a)","paragraphs":["The extended logic system distinguishes among more or less important terms in both gueries and documents by using weights, or importance indicators attached to the terms. Thus instead of terms A and B, the system processes terms (A.a) and"]},{"title":"(B,b)","paragraphs":["respectively, where a and b designate the weights of terms A and B."]},{"title":"b) c) d)","paragraphs":["The extended system simulates the llnguistic characteristics of more or less strict synonyms, by attaching a ~-value to each or-operator that specifies the degree of strictness of the corresponding operator. The higher the p-value attached to an operator, the closer is the interpretation of that operator in accordance with the rules of ordinary Boolean logic. On the other hand, the smaller the p-value, the more relaxed is the interpretation of the or-operator. The extended system also simulates the linguistic characteristics of more or less strict phrase attachment, by usin E a p-value for each and-operator. The higher the p-value, the more similar • the corresponding operator will be to the compulsory Boolean and. Correspondingly, the smaller the p-value, the more relaxed is the interpretation of the and operator. The extended system (unlike the ordinary Boolean system) provides ranked output of the stored documents in presumed decreasing order of importance of a given item with respect to a query. In addition, the extended system provides much better retrieval output, than systems based on conventional Boolean logic. Experimentally, improvements of 100 to 200 percent in retrieval effectiveness have been noted for the extended logic over the conventional Boolean system. [17,18]","It is not possible in the present context to furnish the details of the operation of the extended logic system. The following results are, however, relatively easy to prove: [17]"]},{"title":"a)","paragraphs":["When p-values equal to infinity are used, the extended system produces results identical to that of the conventional Boolean logic systems;"]},{"title":"b)","paragraphs":["When the p-values are reduced from infinity, the distinctions between phrase components (and) and synonym specification (or) become more and more blurred;","c) When p reaches its lower limit of 1, the distinction between and and or operators is completely lost. and the system reduces the queries (A and B) and (A or B) to a system with terms (A,B), without any relationship specification between terms A and B.","Using linguistic analogues, the following examples illustrate the operations of the extended logic system. The p-value attached to operators is shown in each case as an exponent:"]},{"title":"117","paragraphs":["i) (A andco B) interpreted as ALL OF (A,B) (strict phrase) iii (A and 3 B) interpreted as MOST OF (A,B) (fuzzy phrase)","iii) (A and I B) interpreted as SET (A,B) (more matching terms are worth more than fewer matching terms) iv) (A fl~ I B) identical to (A ~nd I B) interpreted as SET (A,B) v) (A ~ 3 B) interpreted as SOME OF (A,B) (fuzzy synonym) vi) (A ~ B) interpreted as ONE OF (A,B) (strict synonym) 3. Experimental Results","The operations of the extended logic system are illustrated by using a collection of 3204 computer science articles (titles and abstracts) originally published in the C~unications of the ACM (the CACM collection), and a collection of 1460 articles in library science obtained from the Institute for Scientific Infomation (the CISI collection). Table 1 shows average performance figures for 7 selected queries used with CACM, and 4 selected queries for CISI. The performance in Table 1 is stated in terms of the search Dreclslon at various ~ points averaged over the set of search requests in use. [19]","The data of Table 1 indicate that the conventional Boolean searches (p = co, Boolean) produce by far the worst performance for both collections. Performance improvements between 100 and 200 percent are obtained by relaxing the interpretation of the Boolean operators (that is, by using lower p-values). A distinction must be made between taking into account only single term matches (p-values are equal to 1), and giving extra weight to term phrase matches (A and B .rid ...), and to synonym set matches (A or B or ...), when p-values higher than 1 must be used. The results of Table I show that for the CACM queries the best overall policy is a complete softening of the Boolean operators down to p = 1. Evidently not many of the quasi-Boolean phrases included in the CACM queries were also present in the document abstracts. For the ISI queries, on the other hand, 154 percent improvement is produced when p = 1; when the phrase combinations are given extra weight, the improvement in performance jumps to 164 percent for p = 2, and to 182 percent when and- and or-operatocs are given different values (p and = 2.5 and p or = 1.5, respectively).","These phenomena are further illustrated in the output of Tables 2 and 3. The comparison between query CACM Q5 and Document 756 is outlined in Table 2. No abstract was available for document 756; hence only the title words could be used in the query-document comparison. As the example shows. only the term \"editing\" was present in both document title and query. This explains why the single term match (p = l) produces the best output rank of 5 for this document. Obviously, the sample document is not retrievable by the pure Boolean search (p = co) as demonstrated by the simulated retrieval rank of 1667 out of 3204 CACM documents.","Table 3 shows an example where matching phrases make a substantial difference in the retrieval results. The matched phrases in Document 1410 are given a double underline in Table 3, whereas matched single terms have a single underline. The output of Table 3 shows that when the single terms alone are considered, document 1410 is retrieved with a rank of 53 in response to query ISI Q33. When the phrase matches are given extra weight (p = 2. or p and = 5, p or = 2), the retrieval rank improves to 2 and 7, respectively.","These results demonstrate that the conventional Boolean logic does not adequately reflect the tentative and uncertain nature of the relations between terms in the language. When a relaxed interpretation of Boolean logic is used, the correspondence with the fuzzy nature of linguistic relations is much greater and dramatic improvements in term matching and hence retrieval effectiveness are obtained.","4. Relationship of Extended Boolean Model with Other Retrieval Developments","The extended Boolean system is based on the use of certain term relationships--notably term phrases and synonymous constructions. These relations are. however, interpreted flexibly, reflect-ing the uncertain nature of term relations in the language. Tn the extended system, soft Boolean queries are easy to formulate, and methods exist for a completely automatic formulation of the soft queries, given only some basic information about user needs. [20] Analogously, initial queries may be automatically reformulated, following an initial search operation, based on information obtained from the user about the relevance of previously retrieved documents. [183","The current development may then be related to other retrieval models that incorporate term relations, and to systems with advanced user interfaces. Term relations of a statistical, or probabilistic nature are included in the probabilistic retrieval model; more general linguistic relations are used in systems that include a natural language analyzer. In the probabilistic retrieval system, the documents are ranked in decreasing order of the probabilistic expression p(x[rel)/P(xlnonrel) where P(x~rel) and P(x[nonrel) represent the occurrence probabilities of an item x in the relevant and nonrelevant document subsetso respectively.

[3]","When linguistic analysis methods are used to analyze query and document content, it is in theory possible to provide a precise representation of query and document content by including a great variety ot term relations in the search and retrieval Operations. In particular, complex indexing units such as noun and prepositional phrases might then be assigned to the information items for content representation, Unfortunately, a complete treatment of noun phrases by automatic means remains elusive in view of the multiplicity of different term relations that are expressible by noun and prepositional phrases.

The operational retrieval system that actually performs the searches is normally not modified by the interface system.
