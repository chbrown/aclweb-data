This problem can be solved by specifying a collection of rules concerning the obligatory coreference and obligatory noncoreference. The exact format of these rules is beyond the scope of this paper. For inflexional languages they depend on the type of considered sentence, the sentence- -level functions of considered phrases and their syntactic shape. As a simple example of such a rule let us consider the basic criterion of excluding coreference: If the object is expressed by means of a reflexive pronoum, then it is coreferential with the subject; in other cases the referential identily of the subject and object is excluded.","This criterion can be applied both for deterrninig coreferents of objects - blocking the subject, and in tesf/n~ the possible antecedents of the subject - blocking the objects. This is exactly the case we have in (5). THE RULE OF' RESTRICTED CHOICE","A conclusive criterion of being a prototype results from analysing a given sentence it% isolation.
