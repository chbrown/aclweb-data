The program uses an especially single and uniform control structure with a well defined separation of the different knowledge sources used during ge~,eration. Furthermore, the majority of t/le syst~n's knowledge is expressed in a declarative form, so in priciple the generator ' s knowledge bases could be used for purposes other than gex,eration. The ge~erator uses a two-pass control structure, the first translating from the s~nantically orientated case-labelled dependency structures into surface syntactic trees and the second translating from these trees into English str i~/s. The generator is very flexible: it can be run in such a way as to produce all the possible syntactically legitimate variations on a giveJ, utterance, and has built in facilities to do some synon~s substitution. It has been used in a nu, ber of application domains: notably as a part of a free text retrieval system and as part of a natural language front end to a relational database system. i. Introduction This pa[~er describes a progrmn which has been constructed to translate from Boguraev ' s case-labelled depe~idency representations (Boguraev, 1979: see also 8oguraev and Sparck Jones, 1982) to English strings. Although the principles on which the program has been constructed are primarily a new mix of established idea~, the generator incorporates a number of novel features. In particular, it caLlbines an especially simple a,~ uniform control structure with a well defined separatlon of t/le differe~,t ka,owledge sources used du~ing generation. It operates in two passes, the f~rst translating from the semantically orientated case-labelled dependency structures into surface syntactic trees a~,d the secona translating fran these trees into English strings. The translation fran de[~_ndency structures to surface syntactic trees is the more c~mplex of the two passes unaertaken by the generator a~ will be described here. The other, translation from instantiated surface trees to text strings is relatively straightforward and will not be dealt with in this paper. It is fundamentally a tree flattening process, and is described in detail in Tait and Sparck Jones (1983). 2. The Generator's Knowledge Structures The generator's Knowledge is separated into four sections, as follows.","i) a set of bare templates of phrasal and clausal structures which restrict the surface trees other parts of the system may produce by defining the branching factor at a giv~_n node type. For example, the patterns record that English has intransitive, transitive and ditransitive, but not tritraneitive, verb phrases. The bare template for noun phrases is illustrated in Figure i.","2 ) a lexicon and an associated morphological process~.","3) a set of productzon rules which fill out partially instantiated syntactic trees produced from the phrasal ~,~ clausal patterns.

Tra,,slation frr, n Dependency Structures to Surface Syntactic Trees The pranary work of conversion frQm the dependency representations to the surface syntactic trees is ~Luertaken by a set of production rules, each rule being associated with ane of the case labels used ~, 8oguraev's representation scheme. These rules are applied by a suite of programs which exploit information about the structure of Bcguraev ' s dependency structures. For example they know where in a nominal aependency structure to find the word sense name of the head noun ('oscillatorl' in Figure 2) and where to find its case list (to which the production rules should be applied).","(n (oscillatorl THING ( @@ det ( thel ONE) ) (## nmod","((((trace (clause v agent))"]},{"title":"(clause","paragraphs":["(v (be2 BE ( @@ agent","(n (frequencyl SIGN)) ) (@@ state","(st (n (n~,eless NIL))","(val ( high3 KISD ) ) ) )","))) ))) ))1","Figure 2 Boguraev Representation used for \"the high frequency oscillator\" It must be emphasize~ that Bcguraev's use of the teon case is much wider than is cxma,on in i inguistics. Not only is it used to cover prepositior~al attac~L~nt to nouns as ~ell as verbs; it is also used to cover sane other forms of attac~nent to, and modification of, nouns, for example by determiners ( like \"a\" ) and even for plural or singular number. In the pi~:ase \"the high frequ~,cy oscillator\", whose representation is illustrated by Figure 2, the link between ' oscillatorl ' ( standing for \"oscillator\" ), and the determiner ( ' (thel ONE) ', representing \"the\") is the so-called case-label de__~t. Similarly the prenominal modifier \"high frequent-y\" (represented by ti~e c~nplex structure to the lower right of the flgure) is linked to 'oscillatorl' by nmod. Each ca~e-associated production rule takes four inputs, as follows:","11 the depea]dent iten attacheu to tI~ case link, for example ' (thel ONE)' i,i the case o~ det given below;","2) an environment which is used to pass information from the processing of higher levels of the representation down to lower levels: for example tense fran the sentential level into an embedde~ relative clause; the enviroament is also used to allow various kinds of control over the generation process: for example to determine how many paraphrases of a sentence are produced;","3 ) a partially instantiated phrase or clause template, which will ultimately form part of the surface syntactic tree output by the first pass of the generator;","4 ) the dictionary entry for the daminant itam of tI~ current case list: in Figure 2 this is the entry for ' oscillatorl ', presented in Figure 3.","(oscillatorl","( oscillatorl-#1","(root oscillator )","(syntax-patterns Noun-phrase-pattern ) ) )","Figure 3 Dictionary entry for 'oscillatorl' The rules vary greatly in cx~nplexity: the structure illustrated in Figure 2 requires the use of both the simplest and most complex form of rule. The det production rule may be described in pseudo-English as: If the partially inst~,itiated template is for a noun ptu:ase then look up the lexical items (potentially synon~nl~) as~.~ciated with the word sense name 'thel', and insert each in the determiner slot in a new copy o~ r/le syntactic node. (Of course for English there is only one lexical item associated with 'thel': \"the\".) At the other extreme is the production rule for the nmod case. The nmcd case in Bcguraev's dependency structures is used to associate the pre-ncminal modifiers in a ccni~und nominal with tI~e ~ead notu~. The pre-~cminal modifiers are represented as a list of simple nQninal representations.","(Noun-Phrase (NIL the NIL NIL NIL ((Noun-Phrase NIL NIL NIL NIL","(high) NIL frequ~icy NIL)) oscillator NIL) )","Figure 4 Surface Structure Tree for","\"the high frequency oscillator\" In English the nmod production rule might be"]},{"title":"195","paragraphs":["expres~eu a~: If the partially instantiated template is for a noun phrase, apply the processor which, given an existing ,~3minal representation, instantiates a corresponding phrasal ~Iplate, to each nominal repr~ztati~z in the dependent item list: form the results into a set of lists, one for each combination of possible results for expressing each nominal: insert each result list ~zto a copy of the partially instantiated t~nplate Originally passed to the rule. The surface structure tree prc~L_~fed after these rules have been applied to the representation of Figure 2 is given in Figure 4. Note that the tree contains syntactic category names, and that unfilled slots in the tree are filled with NIL. Thus if the phrase to be generated was \"all the high frequency oscillators\", the flrst NIL in the surface syntactic tree (representing the unfilled quantifier slot of the dominant noun phrase node) would be replaced by \"all\". The order of the words in the surface syntactic tree represents the order in which they will be produced in the output sentence. These two production rules, for the det and case labels, are fairly typical o-f-those used el~ewhere in the system. There is, however, an {,nportant feature tt~y fail to illustrate. In c<xztrast with more ccnve~tional cases, ~ and det do not require the identification of a lexical ~tem associated with the case-label itself. This is of course necessary when expressing prepositional plzases. 4. Distinctive Feauures of this Translation Process The two most noteworthy features of the generation phase which produces surface structure trees are tl~e control structure employed and distribution of the syst~ language knowledge between its dl ~ferent components. NO mention Of the system's c~trol structure was made in the previous section. The structure used zs sufficiently powerful and elegant tlmt it could be ignored entirely when building up the systems ~zowledge of Bcguraev's representation language an~ of English. However, the efficiency of the generator described here is largely a result of the control structure used. It is rare for this system to take more than a few fracti~,s of a sec~ to generate a sentex,ce: a sharp contrast with approaches based on unification, like Appelt's (1983) TELk~RAM. First the current representational structure is classified as clausal, sL~ple nominal, Or complex (typically relativised) nominal. Second, a suitable structure dismantling function is applied to the structure which identifies the head lexical token from the structure and separates out its case-list. Third the dictionary entry for the head lexical item is obtained, and. after checkinu the syntactic ~arKers in the dictionary ~,try anu phrasal or clause templates suitable for the environ~,t are ic~ztified. Fourth, appropriate production rules are applied to each ele, ent of the structure's case list in order to instantiate the templates. Frequently this whole process is applied recursively to some dependent representation level. So, for example, the representation for \"high frequency\" is prccessed by a second call of the noun phrase processor from within the call dealing with the dominant noninal, 'oscillatorl'. When the case list has been completely processed, the di~rsntling function applies any necessary morphological processing to the head lexical item ( for example to reflect subject/verb and person/nu~ agre~Rent). This simple fra~nework covers all the processing done by the generator. The split ~etween the syntactic ~lowledge represented in the p|u:asal and clausal templates a~ in the production rules is also unusual. The templates define the shape of t/~e surface syntactic trees which the system can produce. It places no restrictions on the form of the fillers for any slot in a gran~ node. The production rules ~,force categorial and order~,~ restrictions. So, for example, the templates reflect the fact that English possesses hztransitive, transitive and ditransitive verbs, whilst the production rules ensure that the subject of a clause is of a suitable syntactic category, and that the subject precedes the verb in simple declarative sentences. The surface structure trees prcduce~ contain all the words in the sentence to be produced in the order and form in which they are to be output. Thus it is a straightforward matter to generate English strings fran them. 5. C~iclusion The generator presented here is in essence a development of the Micro-Mumble generator descriheu in Mee|~ (1981). But in the process of extending Meehan's framework for a wide coverage system, his original design has been radically transformed. Most notably, the system described here has its syntactic knowledge largely separated fran its knowledge of the input representation language. It has, however, retained the eleg~It control structure of Meehan's original. This distinguishes it from the early generators in the same style, like Goldman's (1975) BABEL. At the san~ thne the generator described here is very flexible: it can be run in such a way as to produce all the possible syntactically legitimate variations on a given utterance, and has built in facilities to do same synonym substitution. The envircnn%~-nt mechanism is very ( perhaps too) powerful, and could be used to dynastically select possible ways of expressing a given structure in almost any way required. The system's knowledge of ,~tural language and of"]},{"title":"196","paragraphs":["t~ representation language is expressed in a fundmn~itally r%/le-like way, most notably without the use o£ an assignment ~necl~Lnism. In principle such rules could be used backwards, that is they could be used to parse incoming English. H~ver no work has been done to develop a parser which uses t/~ generators rules, so this possibility remains pure speculation at present. The generator described here, it must be e,pbasized, covers Only part of the task of generation. Unlike, for example, McKecwn's (1980) system, it deals not with what to say, but only with how to say it. Boguraev ' s representation identifies sentence bot~K~aries and the majority of content word~ to be used in the utterance being produceu (see Figure i), making the task of the generator relatively straightforward. However, the techniques used could deal with a representation which was much less closely related to the surface text provided this representation retained a fairly straightforward relationship between propositional units of the meaning representation ~u~ the clausal structure of the language. For example, a representat ion language which represented ally states and times, but not the events which linked different states and times would probably require a more puwerful framework than ti~t provided by the generator described here. Hc~ver, another case-labelled dependency language, like Schank's ( 1975 ) Conceptual Dependency (CD) Representation, could be handled by providing the ge~lerator with a new set of syntactico-semant£c production rules, a new lexicon ~ and t/~ replaca~ent of the functions for dismantling Boguraev's dependency representation with functions for dismantling CD structures. The fr~ork of ti~ g~lerator has been completely implemented and tested with a lexicon of a few hundred words and a grammar covering much of the E,~lish noun plu:ase and a number of the more straightforward sentence types. It has bee__n used in a number of applications, most notably document retrieval (Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984a and 1984b) and relational database access (Bcguraev and Sparck Jales, 1983). The program described here is efficient (rarely taking more than a few fractions of second to generate a seJ,tence) in c~,trast with approaches based On complex pattern matching (like Appelt (1983), and Jacohs (1983)). On the other |round, the esse~itial simplicity and uniformity of the approach adopted here has meant that the generator is no ,sore difficult to maintain and extend than i~re linguistically motivated approaches, for example Appelt's. Thus it has demonstrated its usefulness as a practical tool for computational linguistic research. ~CKNOWLE[~S~2~TS This work was supported by the British Library Research and Development Department and was undertaken in the University of C;,nbridge Ccmguter Laboratory.
