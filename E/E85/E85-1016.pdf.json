Our work on the processin~ of a special kind of linguistic information, namely temporal information ,has led us to advocate the use of a language with the following characteristic features: -","high level of abstraction; - capacity for inference; - modularity.","A high level of abstraction is needed to deal with complex lin£uistic notions which are not easily reducible to elementary data structures.","A capacity for inference is required, as most criteria or tests in linguistics make use of particular kinds of deductions, at different levels of the linguistic analysis.","As for modularity, a typical situation in linguistics has to do with a hierarchy of concepts or units, and the relations between those units at different levels.","This paper discusses the relevance of the choice of parametrized abstract"]},{"title":"objects","paragraphs":["as tools for linguistic information processing and exemplifies the use of such objects for temporal information. INTRODUCTION","In computational linguistics, more than often there is a tendency to directly implement a model without really ~oing through a specification step which would provide a correct abstraction of the implementation. This attitude has at least two drawbacks: Firstly, there is no formal way of comparing two models; this can lead to some pointless discussions between different approaches which, at an abstract level, can be shown to be equivalent; secondly, any extension or modification of the implemented model requires a different program instead of a mere adjustment at the abstract level which should facilitate the modular updatin~ of the implementation and allow a formal comparison between the old and the new model.","Our work on tense -and time has convinced us that, especially in linguistic domains where models are either loose or controversial, a systematic approach to linguistic information processin~ allowing compatible constructions at all levels is highly desirable. We therefore advocate the use of a language with the following features:","-","high level of abstraction;","- capacity for inference;","- modularity.","This paper is in two parts. In the first part, we try to justify our choice of abstract parametrized objects as adequate tools for lin~uistic information processing; in the second part we exemplify our approach by ~ivin~ a detailed account of the way we define and construct temporal objects. PARAMETRIZED ABSTRACT OBJECTS","One of the basic difficulties in natural language processing arises from the fact that modularity is both a desirable and hardly attainable property of the systems. At first it seems quite reasonable to break the programs into manageable, modular sub-programs0 especially as the linguistic data, at least at first approximation,lend themselves to a clear-cut classification in terms of morphology, syntax, semantics and pra~matics. Moreover, comparatively sophisticated techniques and methods are already available in eachsubfield. Unfortunately, it has now become"]},{"title":"107","paragraphs":["commonplace knowledge that this strategy of developing separate modules for each sub-problem and integratin~ them smoothly is not satisfactory: the operations of parsing sentences, producing internal representations, reasoning about them, answerin~ questions, generatin~ text, and so on, are strongly interdependent. The degree, order and location of the interactions between different parts may vary significantly, according to individual situations.","A consequence of the realization of this fact has been the development of strongly integrated, usually procedural systems, where the individual sub-programs operate simultaneously on several deeply intricated linguistic levels . The price one has to pay for a relative success of this approach is in terms of understandability and ~eneralization: many systems are strongly dependent on the particular type of problem they have been programmed to solve, and possible extensions or transpouitions would require fundamental modifications.","Uhat kind of software tools would allow at the same time modularity and multi-faceted, polymorphic and concurrent interactions between processes ? Modularity and complex interactions are characteristic features of the object oriented paradigm . Modularity iS provided by the structuration in terms of objects. Complex interaction is a consequence of the distribution of the control between t~e different objects and of the (possibly multiple) inheritance facilities between hierarchically dependent objects. The possibility of using different points of views fOr the same objects is a consequence of this structuration.","This approach leads to focussing on the basic process of abstraction. In this context, abstraction is a process which, starting from a description of the data, yields an abstract specification. This involves three steps.","- define the relevant objects for the problem under study;","- define the possible functions and relations on the objects;","-give explicitly the constraints between the functions and relations.","The object-oriented approach is usually equated with the Smalltalk \"vision\" ( Goldberg and Robson, 1983 ), while other views of objects are rejected as being irrelevant or even self contradictory.","Smalltalk objects can be characterized by the following properties: - Each object is an instance of a class (a generic object). -","Each object has a local memory which can only be updated by functions (or procedures) local to the object. -","Objects are orsanlzed into a tree-llke hierarchy implyin~ tree-like inheritance. -","Communication between objects is organized through message passing.","However ,it has been argued that the object oriented approach can be fruitfully carried over into applicative language contexts (Steels ,198Z) or into particular systems based on lo~ic where the fundamental mechanism is data abstraction (Goguen et al. 1983).","As regards Smalltalk, it does not provide systematic facilities for deflnin~ abstract data types; all computations are highly dependent on side effects (assi£nment is systematically used in local operations) and there is no explicit typing.","ge favour the approach exemplified by such lan£uaaes as OBJ and their possible extensions (Goguen and Meseguer, 1984), as we think that they will allow ,in the lon~ range, a more efficient programming style and make the systematic proof of programs possible.","The OBJ languaQe is based upon data abstraction: an object is a type (i.e. a domain of values with functions accessing those values); objects are organized into a hierarchy ( an acyclic ~raph) representin~ the dependencies among types. Computations are performed by using equatlonal axioms as oriented rewrite rules.","Therefore , granted the availability of a theorem prover , the consistency of the specifications given in the abstract data type can be formally checked. More-over , since the objects have a clear mathematical definition, all the techniques of abstract algebra are also available.","More generally, axioms could be given not only as equations . but also as formulas in a logical theory (such as first order predicate calculus or temporal logics) assuming those theories satisfy some given restrictions ( Goguen and Bursta11, 1984).","As we have no access yet to any version of OBJ, we have decided , in a first stage, to restrict the object structure to its free component, i.e. only the signatures, not the axioms are defined. Therefore~ the computations have to be explicitely coded. As a consequence,, no checking of consistency"]},{"title":"108","paragraphs":["is possible for the time being.","The actual implementation is done in the ML language (Gordon et al., 1979). ML is a functional language which is fully higher-order. \"It has a polymorphic type discipline which combines the flexibility of programming in a typeless language with the security of compile-time type checking\". Moreover, one can define one's own types , which may be abstract and/or recursive.","To give a flavour of the ML programming style, consider a possible definition of the abstract recursive type of binary trees, with tip values of an arbitrary type (denoted by *) and non tip nodes of some other arbitrary type (denoted by **). (This exemple is taken from Gordon et al., 1979):","absrectype (*,**) tree = * + ** # (*,**)tree # (*,**)tree with tiptree x = abs_tree (inl x) and comptree (y,tl,t2) =","abs_tr(~u (inr (y,tl,t2)) and istip t =isl(rep_tree t) and tipof t= outl(reptree t) and labelof t = fSt(OUtr (reptree t)) and sonof t =snd(outr(reptree t))","This type is defined as recursive and abstract. The symbols \"+\" and \"#\" respectively, denote the two type constructors \"disjoint sum\" and \"cartesian product\" The functions \"abs_tree\" and \"rep_tree\" ,both of them of type (ty -> ty), are only available inside the definition of the abstract type \"tree\" : abs_tree maps the concrete representation of a tree unto its abstraction; rep_tree has the converse effect. Finally, isl, inl, inr, outl, outr are functions or predicates on the disjoint sum. They are defined as follows:","isl: (* + **) -> bool","tests membership of left summand;","inl: * -> (* + **)","injects into left summand;","inr: * -> (** + *)","injects into right summand;","outl: (* + **) -> *","projects out left summand;","outr: (* + **) -> **","projects out right summand.","The signature of this type is the set of operators: tiptree=-: * -> (**,*)tree comptree=-: • # (**,*)tree # (**,*)tree ->(*,**)tree istip=-: (*,**)tree ->bool tipof=-: (*,**)tree ->** l~belof=-:(*,**) tree -> * sonof=-: (*,**)tree ->((**,*)tree # (**,*) tree))","The version of ML we use (INRIA ,1984) is written in Lisp with access to the lisp system. So our object environment is constructed as a collection of abstract data types. The hierarchy between types results from the combination and enrichment of more basic types. This hierarchy creates multiple inheritance relations between types. Some examples will be given in the context of temporal objects. Clearly, the management of the object level must be done on top of ML The explicit coding mixes Lisp and ML.","As we work in a functional environment there is no \"local memory\".However, this is , to our viewpoint, a minor drawback compared to the advantage of the abstraction facilities. In a next stage, we intend to introduce the necessary axioms and perform the computations in a deductive style.","This approach can be used for the formal representation of natural language, or as a grammar formalism . In particular the syntactical and semantical analysis can be done in terms of objects. (De Boissieu and Forest , 1985). PROCESSING TEHPORAL INFORMATION Tense and time representation in natural languages is generally studied under one of the three main disciplines : logics, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. A brief overview of these","4 different vlewpolnts is given in (Bestougeff an Ligozat, 1984).","The main problem is to choose the relevant objects in order to get an adequate abstraction. It must be strongly emphasized that we deny ourselves the right to assume any particular physical representation of time from the outset. The concrete properties result from the specifications.","The choice of the basic objects is somehow arbitrary, but it should nevertheless comply to the following rules :the objects must be","- close to linguistic intuit{on.","-","general enough to be reusable as","such in different contexts, or give rise","to new objects by enrichment or","inheritance.

To achieve these goals it may be necessary to define primitive objects, which do not have any lingustic interpretation but are merely buildinE blocks whose use enhances modularity In this case ,the lower level objects can be hidden to the user","Keeping this in mind ,we can now proceed to the description of the linguistic motivations which are behind the construction of temporal objects The idea is to ~ive a systematic way of representing temporal information by defining abstract structures based upon the concepts and the hypotheses of a particular linguistic theory.","The linguistic theory we rely on is that of A. Culioli (Culioli, 1980), suitably adapted to computational purposes.","Temporal information can be informally characterized as information pertaining to the location and \"shape\" of the states and events described by natural language. In particular, this includes what is commonly referred to as aspect.","Furthermore, temporal information in natural language has both a descriptive and an operative structure: it describes and allows the users to make systematic inferences. Among these inferences are those concerned with the ordering of events, but such inferences are only part o~ a whole set of inferences on the factuality, the degree of completion, the type of occurrence, of the situations considered. In fact, it can be argued that the ordering relations are not necessarily of a primary nature.","Some examples will illustrate the kind of data and inferences we have in mind.","Consider the following simple sentences: (i) John is ill. (2) John repairs cars. (33 John is repairing my car. (4) John repaired my car. (5) John has repaired my car. (6) John was repairing my car. (7) My car has been repaired. (83 My car is repaired now. (9) John was singing. (i0) John sang. (Ii) John has been singing. (12) Cats are smart.","We wish to account for some basic information imparted by the use of such sentences. For example: - Sentence (2) does not imply (3), neither does sentence (3) imply sentence"]},{"title":"(2).","paragraphs":["- Sentence (4) implies sentence (7), not (8). - Sentence (5) implies sentence (8). - Sentence (6) implies neither sentence (7) nor, a fortiori, (8), whereas sentence (9) implies sentences (i0),(ii).","The different uses of the simple present tense in (I) and (Z) are related to a difference between the semantic types of the verbs t_So bee ili and to repair. We will account for this difference by adapting a classification (essentially due to Vendler (1967)) into four semantic types ( state, activity, accomplishement, achievement ) . The usefulness of such a classification is further illustrated by comparing the behaviour Of the verb to repair in sentences (6, 7, 8) with that of the verb t So sin~ in (9, 10, 11).","The comparison between (4) and (6) in relation with (7) shows the necessity of suitably representing the difference between the simple and the progressive past, at least for verbs of the type to repair a car , which are classified as accomplishments.","To represent the difference between (4) (simple past) and (5) (present perfect), we have to express what makes (8), but not (4), derivable from (5). Reichenbach's system of temporal indexes (point of speech, point of event, point of reference ) can be used to handle this phenomenon (Reichenbach, 1957 ). It provides a way of describin~ the notion of \"present relevance\", which is present in (5) , but not in (4).","The contrast between (1 , 2) and (12.) points to another kind of distinction one has to make: (i) expresses a state, (2) a habit, which hold at the moment of speech. On the contrary, (12) states a general fact which is basically undetermined with respect to the moment of speech. Dependence on the time of speech is a fact of temporal deixis. Ue shall refer to it as enunsiativit Z , (following A. Culioli) . By opposition situations such as (12) will be termed aoristic.","The preceding examples give sume idea of the type of information that has to be represented. We have deliberately played down the purely sequential type of information, which is the only type of temporal information most systems are concerned with.","Moreover, the purely sequential type of information is mostly incomplete"]},{"title":"110","paragraphs":["(this is stressed in particular by Smith (1978)). Consider the followina examples: (13) John saw his doctor this morning: he is ill. (14) John saw his doctor this morning: now he is ill.","Contrastin~ (13) and (14) shows a potential indeterminacy in the relation between the two sentences. Smith (1978) claims that sentences like (I), where no explicit \"reference time\" is provided (e.g. by a time adverbial such as now) are temporally incomplete. Ue will be content at this point of our discussion with notin~ the need for a convenient notation for such a phenomenon. TEMPORAL OBJECTS Ue assume that temporal information","in a text can be represented by","proceedin~ in three steps of increasin~","difficulty: -","Tense in main clauses. -","Tense in subordinate clauses. -","Tense in texts.","This hierarchy follows that Of Ejerhed","and Janlert ( 1981).","To summarize the discussion of the previous paragraph, the followina elements of temporal information have to be abstracted: -","temporal deixis (enunciative vs.","aoristic situations) . Followin~ Comrie","(1976), we use the term \"situation\" as a","generic term coverin~ states, events or","processes . - inception and termination of a","situation. - information relative to the","completion of the situation. -","local inferences on situations. -","mass/count properties of situations.","In our system, these elements are reconstructed from the followin~ linguistic data:","- tenses in the finite forms of verbs.","temporal specifiers (temporal adverbials).","-semantic types of situations (computed from the semantic type of the verbs & la Vendler, and the syntactic structure of the proposition).","At this point, most existin~ systems of representation make a choice, since a notion of duration has to be included in the model as well. Either one conceives of the basic elements as points, and the notion of an interval has to be introduced; or an interval is a basic element, and a second relation (of overlapplna or inclusion ) is introduced. In fact, in most existina models of time, the basic elements of time are conceived as elements or subsets of (a subset o£) the real line (or some ramified structure built from it).","The choice of either \"points\" or \"intervals\" as basic elements leads to definite advantages and particular difficulties. The point model is basically simpler, but in some way harder to justify semantically. However, as shown by Kamp (1979) and Van Benthem ( 1980 ), both points of views are essentially equivalent.","Our claim in the matter follows the ~eneral philosophy of abstraction: Instead o£ the nature of the basic elements, consider their intended properties and combination rules for buildin~ derived elements. This combinatorial point of view is implicit, for example, in Allen's model (Allen 83), where a set of \"intervals\" is abstractly characterized by the relations holdin~ between its elements. It can be shown (Bestou~eff and Li~ozat ,1984) that any set theoritic model of Allen's axioms is equivalent to (a subset) of the intervals (that is, couples of points) on a totally ordered set.","In our model,the basic elements are typed boundaries, with a (partial) order defined on them. As shown in (Bestougeff and Li~ozat, 1984) an alternative way of considerin~ the same abstraction would be in terms of \"intervals\", where an interval is a couple (bl, b2) of boundaries with bl <b2 . In other words, the term \"interval\" has only the notions of a be~innina and an end associated with it, and it is immaterial whether one or the other terminology is used. No topolowical p~operties are implied , only combinatorial properties (in terms of the types of boundaries ) are retained in the abstraction. Boundary types are introduced in the model in order to represent aspectual properties of the data.","As an example, consider again sentences (1) to (12).","The state be ill in (i) holds upon an interval whose left and right boundaries are \"closing\" and \"opening\", respectively. This is a general situation for states in an enunciative setting.","The event John repair my ca.._~ in (5), conversely, holds upon an interval with resp. \"opening\" and \"closina\" left and right boundaries.

The eventual relations between different simple sentences are a result of a computation makin~ use of the temporal structure of those sentences and the order of discourse.","This fact is captured as follows: The structure representin~ a text is constructed stepwise. At each step of the construction, the exlstin~ structure provides a context, in which the order of discourse, in particular, is represented. In technical terms, the corresponding object is called \"temporal site\". It is composed of a sequence of PTS's together with a set of relations on the boundaries of the constituent PTS's.So the next sentence to be examined, taken in isolation, is represented by a possibly incomplete structure (a polytyped string) with a total order on it, but with possible indeterminacies (for example, in the assignment of time indexes). This new structure is inserted into the old one, (already constructed temporal site ) thereby creatin~ new constraints resulting in the evaluation of some undetermined parameters in both structures.","Here a~ain, the precise combination rules are lanKua~e specific, as they depend on the semantic properties of the time relations in the lan~uaae.","It is beyond the scope of this paper ¢o give the rules used for French.
