The computational model, called Augmented Dependency Grammar (ADG), formulates not only the linguistic dependency structure of sentences but also the semantic dependency structure using the extended deep case grammar and fleld-oriented fact-knowledge based inferences. Fact knowledge base and ADG model clarify the qualitative difference between what we call semantics and logical meaning. From a practrical view point, it provides clear image of syntactic/semantic computation for language processing in analysis and synthesis. It also explains the gap in semantics and logical meaning, and gives a clear computaional image of what we call conceptual analysis.","This grammar is used for analysis of Japanese and synthesis of English, in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system called VEN~S (Vehicle for Natural Language Understanding and Synthesis) currently developed by NEC. Legato: Crescendo: Basic Idea","The VENUS analysis model consists of two components, Legato and Crescendo, as shown in Fig. I. Legato based on the ADG framework, constructs semantic dependency structure of Japanese input sentences by feature-oriented dependency grammar rules as main control information for syntactic analysis, and by semantic inference mechanism on a object fields' fact knowledge base. Legato maps syntactic dependency directly to meaningful logical dependency if possible, or maps it to language-particular semantic dependency if two kinds of dependencies do not coincide. The second component, Crescendo, extracts a conceptual structure about facts from the semantic dependency structure through logical interpretation on the language-particular semantic dependency using knowledge based inferences. 11 Input Sentence Morphological"]},{"title":"alysis i (Lexicon)","paragraphs":["Word List"]},{"title":"1P,","paragraphs":["Dependency structure L"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["Semantic Dependency / i Structure /"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["once tual~Str~ -- \" / / C p cture"]},{"title":"IJ","paragraphs":["[ Thesaurus","Analysis F ( Knowledge","Base","Conceptual Dependency Structure"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["Fi~.

Three different kinds of information sources other than the lexicon support language comprehension, and two inference functions defined on them extract the interpretation of input sentences.

It interprets the (semantic) relations between them, and must be inducible from the raw syntagmatic information.

The structure representing semantics may not be interpretable in terms of pure logic, but may be represented linguistically.","I) The ADG defines syntactic dependency structure, semantic dependency structure, and descriminates the semantic dependency from the logical structure.","2) It functions as the interface between syntactic dependency and semantic dependency.","The notion of basically binary \"dependency\" has a primary role to simplify the above interface, just in the sense that either syntactic or semantic inference recognizes interpretable binary relation. The semantics in the sense used here may not necessarily be shared among languages, while facts are shared among languages.","Legato built on the model is syntactic and semantic analysis module which construct directly semantic dependency structure from surface structure.

In this paper word meaning is represented by a logical symbol called CONCEPT SYMBOL. The symbol is a representation primitive for fact knowledge base and internal conceptual representation of sentences. Semantic structure representation is also defined on them, but it borrows syntagmatic function called dummy symbols which never appear in conceptual representation.","The above examples ~I, SEN2 share the same meaning as shown in FACT1, except pragmatic and temporal information. Ordinary analysis of SENI produces subject-predicate-object syntagmatic information, and further case interpretaion of subject-predicate,object-predicate relations. However this kind of case interpretation brings into difficulties to select case marking ambiguities such as GOAl or RESult for the above object-predicate. SEN2 analysis produces instantly REAson interpretation between two nominals in terms of \"REAson\"-marking preposition \"because-of\". This comparison supports the case even a verb must be interpreted in some case as a logical relation and clarifies the standpoint to specify the ADG.","I. Factual(conceptual) information must be independent of syntagmatic meaning as well as independent of syntax.","2.

They play a role to match syntagmatic relation with semantics in terms of syntax. These two processes analize the pragmatic, modal, and temporal information which is added into the factual structure to produce the conceptual structure.","\"Dependency\" is 2nd idea, to figure out that semantic (dependency) analysis of sentences is executable at the same time of syntactic (dependency) analysis. ADG employs dependency framework in a different way from the ordinary one. It deals with prepositions, postpositions, case inflections, grsmmstical functions, copula etc., as the functional features for relational interpretation. For example, preposition in English may not be a syntactic governor ('head' in this paper) of its object phrase, copula \"be\" in front of adjective modifies the syntactic feature of the adjective as a syntagmatic head predicate which allows it to have a dependent marked as a subject, while adjective in itself has a function of pre-nominal modifier. Namely, most of the functional words are dealt like case inflections. They add functional features to words or modify their features. The functional features map word-to-word dependency to concept-to-concept semantic dependency. The figure 3 explains the simple interface mechanism. Functional features such as SUBject, OBJect, BECAUSE-OF corresponds to REAsonl, RF_~son2, REAson respectively. The ADG syntactic dependency rules(see •s below) predict those semantic relations using the functional features and word syntax, and at the same time they trigger fact knowledge base inference to interpret Concept-to-Concept relations. A fact(concept) knowledge base is composed of such binary pieces as Ss or Cs. In this figure S and C mean semantic knowledge dependent on languages, and conceptual knowledge respectively.

The proposed dependency structure analysis engine (Legato) and the conceptual structure extraction engine (Crescendo) have been implemented. The ADG succeeded in constructively formalizing syntactic specification and semantic interpretation, using the knowledge base of a set of conceptual relations and the inference mechanism on it, defined only by simple binary operations.","Legato and Crescendo were incorporated in VENUS Japanese-to-English machine translation system. The experiments have proved its operational efficacy, fitness and Justification.","The ADG points out anomaly in usual case systems, and resolves it by introducing the concept of dummy relation which can not and must not be interpreted logically.
