We argue that expressions of the first type are comparatively rare in real world Natural Language sentences, and that the latter (articles) cannot be considered straightforward quantlfiers in the first place. However, practically all applications of Natural Language Processfng require sentences to be quantified unambiguously. We llst a few possible ( syntactical, semantical, and \"pragmatical\") sources of \"implicit\" quantiflcatlonal information in Natural Language; they combine in sometimes intricate ways to give a sentence a (more or less) unambiguous quantification.","i. THE LACK OF EXPLICIT QUANTIFICATION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE - \" I. i INTRODUCTION The subject of the present paper is not strictly one of Computational LinEuistics. Neither does it outline a working computer program, nor investigate a linguistic problem with the help of computational methods. A/though the subject may be purely linguistic in character it is particularly relevant to Computational Linguistics. Moreover it seems to have been ignored by most non-computational linguists.","Computational as well as non-computational linguists agree that we have to represent Natural Language sentences as quantified logical sentences, either in a graphical variant of logic such as semantic networks, or in some other form of logic. However, non-computational linguists do not very often use real-world examples in their investigations; they create their own example sentences to make a certain point. Everything which is not in the prhnary focus of their interest is made so explicit as to become largely self-explanatory. They tend, for instance, to create only sentences where quantification is explicit. Computational linguists, on the other hand, have to use real world texts. They have to face certain nasty facts of life which they, too, would prefer to ignore. One of them concerns the way in which Natural Language quantifies.","1.2 THE TRADITIONAL POINT OF VIEW: QUANTIFIERS ARE EXPLICIT Traditionally it has almost always been assumed that quantification is expressed in Natural Language by explicit means. The most traditional view had it that simple surface words correspond one-to-one to the two classical quantifiers: \"every\" and \"all\" stand for the universal quantifier, \"some\" for the existential quantifier: every man is mortal some gods are mortal However, it has long been known that the over-whelmlng majority of real world sentences simply don't contain any of those explicit simple quantifier words.* For this reason (among others) Barwise and Cooper (1981) suggested that the concept of simple quantiflers should be extended to the concept of- gemern]|~ed quant/fiers. They should take care of simple cases such as most men as well as of very complicated ones such as more than half of John's arrows. A generalised quantifer consists, in English, of a determiner (such as . 11 . n most or more than half of ) and a set expression in the form of a noun phrase (such as \"men\" or \"John's arrows\"). Determiners are some,"]},{"title":"e'~e~, each, all, both, no, neither, many, fev;, most, a few, one,","paragraphs":["etc. However, even now a sizeable majority of sentences in any real world text would appear to lack quantification. That's why the most obvious determiners, viz. the and a (plus zero) have to be included in this list. But that's also where a new set of problems originates. Articles have always caused problems when treated as quantifiers, and recently these problems have become increasingly' more difficult to ignore (Kamp 1981).","1.3 PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERPKETATION OF ARTICLES AS QUANTIFIERS Again we start with the most traditional view of the question how articles could be interpreted as quantifiers. It saw both definite and indefinite articles as existential quantlfiers, with some addi-Uonal information in the case of the definite article. It was primarily this \"additional information\" which caused much discussion.","* or verb phrases such as \"there is\" - quite possibly the only \"real\" existential quantifier English has.","I. 3. i Is the Definite Article an Existential Quantifier? Russell, in his classical analysis of the definite article (1905), maintained that a sentence such as 1) The President of France is bald should be interpreted as follows","EXISTS X: (president_of_frence(X) AND NOT(EXISTS Y: (presidant_of_frence(Y) AND NOT(X=Y))) AND bald(X) ) Here the \"additional information\""]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["given in the universal statement that X is the one and only President of France. Strawson (1950) pointed out that sentences such as 2 2) The king of France is bald wou/d simply be false irrespective of whether a) there was exactly one king of France but he was not bald, b) there was no king of France to begin with, or c) there were several kings of France. Our intuition tells us that in case a) sentence 2 would certainly be \"simply false\" but in cases b) and c) it would be false \"in a different way\". Strawson argued that Russell hadn't made the distinction between a sentence as such and the statement made by the use of a sentence. Sentences such as example 2, uttered at the present time, and under condition a), were non-evaluable (not Strawson's term) rather than false. They may be evaluable, and even true, at other points in time (or space, we might add). A definite noun phrase, then, does not assert the existence of some object, it only refers to it, and in doing so it presupposes its existence. In the same sense it doesn't assert the uniqueness of the object referred to, either, it only presupposes it. Unfulfliled presuppositlons don't make sentences false, they make them\" non-evaluable, i.e. the question of whether they are true or false doesn't arise. Whether the presuppositions of such a sentence are fulfilled depends on the concrete circumstances, given by the context.","Subsequently it was noticed that Strawson's analysis gave no satisfactory explanantion for cases such as 3, 4 and 5: 3) The unicorn is a mythical creature. 4) The lion is a dangerous animal. 5) The dog is barking. In 3 we certainly don't presuppose the existence of unicorns, but the sentence makes nevertheless perfect sense. 4 is actually the same case although the fact that lions do exist may obscure this fact at first. We obviously presuppose the existence of the concept of unicorns and lions in the listener's mind, but not the existence of these animals in the real world.","Example 5 shows that definite noun phrases don't presuppose uniqueness of real objects, either. 5 makes perfect sense, in the appropriate context, but nobody would presuppose that there is only one dog in the world. The suggestion that we could temporarily restrict the universe of discourse to the point that it contains only one dog, precisely the one that is barking, is hardly very convincing on intuitive grounds alone, and furthermore McCawley (1981:265) pointed out that it would make sentences 6 and 6a equivalent, which they definitely are not."]},{"title":"6) The clog likes all dogs. 6a) The dog likes itself.","paragraphs":["It might be more appropriate to talk about uniqueness in a contextual domain (McCawley 1981:265, expanding on Karttunen 1976; also Platteau 1980, Kamp 1981, Frey/l%eyla 1983) whose members are created by the context, and are not necessarily elementary real world objects (as in the universe of discourse) but can be sets of real objects, or possibly even purely notional objects such as concepts.","As the problems of definite reference are treated in-depth elsewhere in this volume (Berry-Rogghe) we will restrict ourselves to this very sketchy outline of the problem. The main point in this context is that any notion of the definite article having an existential quantifier as one of its components has evaporated along the way from Russell's analysis to contemporary views. Without additional sources o£ quantification a considerable proportion o£ real world sentences would now appear to be merely un-quantified, meanlngless, expressions, which they certainly aren't. But it gets even worse.","I. 3.9. Is the Indefinite Article an Existential Quantifier? The indefinite article seems, on the surface, to cause much less trouble than the definite article. Its interpretation as an existential quantifier always looked quite straightforward. However, it was noticed (Kamp 1981) that indefinite articles sometimes must be represented as universal quanriflers. Prominent among these cases are the so-called donkey sentences, exemplified by sentences 7 and 8. 7) If Pedro owns a donkey he is rich. 8) If Pedro owns a donkey he beats it. The trsditlonal, and most natural, representation of 7 is 7a","7a) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(pedro,X)) IMPLIES rich(pedro). where the top-most syntactic connector of the English sentence, i.e. the conjunction \"if\", corresponds to the top-most connector of the logical form, i.e. the implication. However, if we apply the same schema mechanically to example 8 it will produce the non-sentence 8a:","8a) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(pedro,X)) IMPLIES beats(pedro, X). This is not a logical sentence because the variable \"X\" in the consequent is outside the scope of the existential quantifier and remains unbound. 8 must therefore be represented as 8b","8b) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(pedro,X)) IMPLIES beats(pedro, X)) where the indefinite article is now represented as a universal quantifier. Now we are in the most unsatisfactory situation that we have to represent two s~rntactically very similar surface sentences by two radically different logical sentences, and that the same noun phrase has to be mapped into"]},{"title":"9","paragraphs":["an existential quantifier one time, into a universal quantifier another time.","If we try to consistently represent indefinite articles as universal quantfflers we get 7b as representation for 7","7b) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(pedro,X)) IMPLIES rich(pedro)). which is indeed logically equivalent to 7a, but on purely formal grounds. The scope has been artiflcially extended to span over terms without any variables, which certain/y runs very much against our intuition about the meaning of the original sentence. The conclusion cannot be avoided that even the seemingly innocuous indefinite article cannot be represented as a straightforward existential quantifier.","i. 4 COUNTEREXAMPLES: MOST QUANTIFI~.RS ARE IMPLICIT However, if articles are no longer available as explicit quantiflers we are in real trouble: Either all those Natural Language declarative sentences that do not contain any of the explicit quantifier expressions (\"most\", \"some\", \"there is\" etc.) cannot be represented as logical sentences at all for their lack of quantification, or else we have to find sources of ciuantiflcatlonal information other than explicit quantifier expressions. Now, if we look at sentences 9 to 14 we have to admit a) that they are reasonably normal sentences, b) that they contain no explicit quantifier expressions, and c) that our intuition tells us nevertheless that they are unambiguously quantified. 9) A dog is eating meat. 10) A dog eats meat. 10a) Dogs eat meat. Ii) A man who loves a woman is happy. 12) A man who loves a woman respects her. 13) A man who loves a woman will Elve her a ring. 14) A man who loves a woman will defend her","ag-ln~t an attacker. We think, therefore, and try to show in this paper, that there must be many more sources of quantificatlonal information in NL than ]ust the traditional, explicit, cases. But the information is scattered over whole sentences, or even paragraphs, and must be combined to get a (more or less) reliable quantification for a sentence.","This is a rather unattractive state of affairs: Traditionally, it was assumed that at least the form of quantifiers in hrL sentences was unproblematical, and that we could concentrate right away on the questions of their scope, monotonlcity etc., difficult enough in their own right. If our diagnosis is correct, this is not so. In the rest of the paper we will try to list some of the other possible sources of quantiflcational information in NL. None of them will be of the \"on/off\"-variety; they are all more llke interacting forces resulting in a net force tipping the balance one way mr the other. We will go through all the examples listed above, considering slightly more complex cases as we go along, and try to show how different these seemingly similar examples ~really are as far as their quantif~cati0n is concerned. • ..i"]},{"title":"2.","paragraphs":["2.1","SOURCES OF IMPLICIT QUANTIFICATION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTACTIC MEANS TO EXPRESS QUANTIFICATION 2.1. I Verbal Form The most important way to determine the quantification of a sentence by syntactic • means is through the choice of the verb form. This becomes particularly clear when we look at examples 9 to 10a. They are striking cases in that 9 is a prototypical case of an assertion about an individual event and 10 and 10a are equally prototypical universal ~ules. However, it could be argued that the mass noun used (\"meat\") unnecessarily complicates the situation.

In example 15 we say that a text editor makes modifications to a text file in general, almost by deflnltion. We might read this sentence in a system manual. In 16 to 18 we say, on the other hand, that there is, or was, a case of a text editor making modifications to a text file. These remarks might be made by a system operator, watching his screen. In 16 to 18 we express, of course, additional information about the temporal relationships involved, but we will ignore them in the present context, a Sweeping under the carpet the question of how we would have to represent the sentence predicate we could, as a very first approximation, represent the example with the verb in the present tense, 15, as 15a and the examples with verbs in either the past tense or in the perfective or progressive aspect, 16 through 18, as 16a:","15a) ALL T: (text_edltor(T)","IMPLIES makes_modlfications .... (T))","16a) EXISTS T:(text_editor(T)","AND makes_modifications .... (T)). We must qualify these statements at once.","I. In many cases the future tense is preferred over the present tense for the kind of general statements given in example 15. 19 is definitely more acceptable than 20:","19) A man who loves a woman will stroke her. 20) A man who loves a woman strokes her.","2 Here, and in all the other examples used, the indefinite singular could be replaced by the plural without any change in quantification. We will ,for reasons of simplicity, use only singu/ar examples. 10 Dynamic verbs, such as \"to stroke\", seem to call for the future tense, whereas static verbs, such as \"to respect\", seem to go better with the present tense. The reason for this seems to be that static verbs do not require the future tense to express their permanent validity, as their very meaning as verbs of disposition etc. already conveys this connotation. Many other verbs go either with the present or with the future tense: \"Oil floats on water\" is as acceptable as \"Oil will float on water\".","2. The past tense can express a universally quantified assertion, as in \"A student read books when I was young\", contrary to what we said above. However, for this universal quantification to be possible the sentence requires a spatial or temporal postmodifier, as the one printed in italics. The universal quantification is then not contributed by the verbal form but rather by the postmodifier; the present tense of the verb merely admits it.","3. The progressive aspect can express unlversa/ quantification, as in \"John is always coming late\". Again, thls is only possible it the quantification proper is contributed ,~alulte explicitly by phrases such as","ways\", \"in general\", \"regularly\" etc. The sentence is more emotional than the version in the present tense. Ignoring all these exceptions we can formulate the tentative rules i%1 and 1%2 to sum up what the examples considered so far seem to suggest.","1%1) The subject of a sentence is existentially quantified if the VP is I. in the past tense, 2. in the progressive aspect, or 3. in the reflective aspect.","1%2) Otherwise the subject Is universally quantified, in particular ff it is 1. in the present tense or 2. in the future tense.","3 See des Tombe et al., this volume, for a thorough treatment of the problems connected with the representation of temporal information. 2.1.2 Restrictive Constructions Once we have determined the quantification of the sentence subiect we have to do the same thing for all other sententlal components. Examples Ii and 12 for instance, repeated here for convenience, 11) A man who loves a woman is happy. 12) A man who loves a woman respects her. are variants of the donkey-sentences quoted above (7 and 8). There we had the problem that the object of the restrictive relative clause (\"a donkey\") had to be quantified existentially in the first case, and universally in the second, syntactically very similar, case. Analogously, we must now determine how \"a woman\" is to be quantified. Again, intuition tells us that it is to be quantified existentially in example ii but universally in example 12. However, how could we derive this fundamentally different quantification from the syntactically similar surface sentences?","It's an intriguing observation that a simple change in notation will make the problem go away. Instead of the Predicate Calculus representation lla and 12a with their different explicit quantifiers","lla) ALL M: (man(M) AND EXISTS W: (woman(W)","AND loves(M, W))","IMPLIES happy(M) )","12a) ALL M:(man(M) IMPLIES (ALL W:(woman(W) AND loves(M,W)) IMPLIES respects(M,W)) we represent 11 and 12 in Horn-Clause logic as llb and 12b: Ub) happy(M) :-man(M), woman(W), loves(M,W). 12b) respects(M,W) :- man(M), woman(W),","loves(M, W). Under the standard interpretation of Horn-clauses (as in Prolog) a variable is implicitly universally quantified if it appears on the left hand side of a clause, but existentially quantified if it appears exclusively on the right hand side. The interesting fact is that the Horn-clause representations of the surface sentences are structurally as similar to each other as the surface sentences are, and they differ exactly in the same way the sentences do. The seemingly minor change from a intransitive verb phrase (\"he is happy\") to a transitive verb phrase referring to an element of the antecedent (\"he respects her\") turns an exi- .stential quantification (\"any man is happy if there ls a woman he loves\") into a universal quantification (\"any man respects any woman he happens to love\"). And this is the quantification which virtually \"falls out\" of the Horn-clause representation of theses sentences.","It will be obvious that other restrictive constructions have to be treated the same way. Whether we say \"a man loving a woman repects her\" or \"a woman loved by a man adores him\" or \"a man respects a woman provided he loves her\" - in each case we will have to represent these restrictive expressions as right hand terms, as additional conditions on the values of the corresponding variables.

Using these straightforward translation rules, we get a representation of surface sentences where the correct quantification, in many cases, \"falls out\" of the Horn-clause representation. In these cases we can then say that an indefinite noun phrase corresponds neither to a universal nor to an existential quantifier but that its quantification is a function of its position in the sentence. We will soon see that this kind of nice one-to-one mapping is possible only in a few, simple, cases. 4","If we try to sum up what we gleaned from examples Ii and 12 we could sketch a rule i%3: 1%3) In a restrictive noun phrase those of","its arguments are universally quantified that are referred to by the main verb; otherwise they are existenti-l]y quantified.

On the other hand, a present is, by definition, something you make or buy, i.e. you virtually bring it into local (to the recipient) existence, unless, of course, you pass on a present you got, which is considered in poor taste in our societies. This last point brings us to yet another source of implicit quantificatlonal information: Pragmatic information, including world knowledge, situation and discourse context.","2.3 PRAGMATIC MEANS TO EXPRESS QUANTIFICATION Here we will look at the last remaining example of the original collection, viz. 13) A man who loves a woman will give her a ring.

A ring could be found and passed on to someone one loves, as well as been bought and given away. However, our world knowledge (rather than our language knowledge) tells us that a man doesn't normally have to wait until he finds a ring if he really wants to give one to a cherished person. He can go and buy one; there are rings affordable to just about anyone. That's why 13a would be heavily favoured over 13b.","13a) gives(M, skl(M,W),W) :- man(M), woman(W),","loves(M, W).","ring(skl(M,W)) -- man(M), woman(W),","loves(M, W).","13b) gives(M,R,W) :- man(M), woman(W), loves(M, W), ring(R). Similarly, discourse and situation context can determine the quantification in otherwise ambiguous sentences, such as 47.","47) This printer will print a bold-faced character if you hit this key here.

CONCLUSION There are quite a few sources of \"implicit\" quantification in English, most of them syntactic, some semantic, and a few pragmatic in character. Some of them fall into the category of linguistic means often considered purely stylistic, such as the toplc/comment-distlnctlon and stress/intonation.
