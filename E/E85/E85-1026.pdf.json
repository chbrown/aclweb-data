The kind of morphemic analysis z~resented here is based on a retrograde (right-to-left) analysis of words by means of morphemically unambi- ~-uous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends, which do not coincide with the etymological word-endinjs but correspond to the structure of the accidental cases of zorphemic ~.mbiguity in an inflectional language (word-endings being accountable for in a certain way by word-ends). The algorithm of analysis can thus dispense with any dictionary (of morphemic irrei-alarities and exceptions), economi-cally accounting especially for productive word-endings. The word-ends of the analysis are assigned several kinds of --.or~hemic. information, concerning morphemic categories and le~matization.

The present system, on ~he other hand, i3 based on a retrograde (right-to-left) analysis of words, which makes it possible to disDense bo~h with the dictionary of stems and the dictionary of endings; it was partly inspired hy the system ~CSAIC (Eirschner, 1982) (intended first of all for automatic indexing of technical texts), which is also based on a kind of retrograde analysis: namely, on singlingcut the four rightmost s~umbols of the word-forzs of autosemantic words, which are then matched against a list of word-endings. This kind of analysis, however, c~n.not avoid the danger of ambiguity, which is prevented by a n~mber of ad-hcc restrictions, for example reducing the universe of discourse.","The present system of morDnemxc analysis differs from the ~revious ene~ in several essential respects:","(i) The algorithm of the ~resent type of morphemic analysis can be viewed as a structured list of morp:hemically unambiguous or irresolvably ~nbiguous word-ends of Czech words (which may be accidentally identical with full word-forms) including information concerning their morphemic categories and leL~uatization.

Thus, both the user and the linguist are relieved of the work which must be usually done when a new lexical item is being incorporated into a system of morphemic analysis of an inflectional language.","(vi) The algorithm is going to be implemented in"]},{"title":"PL/1","paragraphs":["within a system of natural language understanding, namely the project of man-machine communication called TIBAQ (Text-and-Inference Based Answering of Questions, cf. (Haji~ov@ and Sgall, 1981)) with no pre-arranged data base and with the capacity of self- -enriching by information drawn from the text; the project is based on the lin~uistic theory of the Functional Generative Description.","(vii) Underlying the algorithm is","large ~aount of empirical work; it ~n~lyzes several tens of thousands of (autosemantic and synsemantic) words (dra~ from a retrograde dictionary of Czech, cf. (Slavf~kov~, 1975)), including the word-foEas of inflected words. The choice of the autosemantic lexical units to be analyzed was carried out with respect to technical texts concerning microelectronics.","2. ~ PHILCSOPHYOF THE STST~","The major novelty of the present approach consists in the conception of (morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ~nbiguous) word-ends, which do not correspond to the (etymological) word- -inflection and word-formation endings but to the cases of accidental morphemic ~nbiguity in an inflectional language, every word-ending being accountable for by at least one word-end (piece of output information). On the other hand, every word-end corresponds to (stands for) at least one lexical word, and due to the cases of morphemic ~mbi~uity, it represents ~t least one word-form. A word-end i~ usually equivalent to a part of a word-form, \"out accidentally it may be equivalent to a full word-form.","The algorit~, of analysis, embodying","conception of procedural morphemics, can be viewed as a structured list of word-ends arranged in a branching structure consisting of ~es-no answers to queries, with correspon-~ing sequences (strings) of symbols of increasing length, which is dub to the retrograde adding of symbols (we use 40 letters of the Czech alphabet, including the ones with diacritics), until morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ~nbiguous word-ends are found (morphemic ambiguity counting as a valid result of the analysis, since it can be resolved, in most cases, by means of the syntactic analysis). The word-ends are assigned the kinds of information as described in section 3.","In the present system of morphemic analysis, there is no place for the notion of (etymological) irregularity, all word-ends being equally \"regular\"; the differences between them can be accounted for e.g. in terms of their length or of their positions on the scale of absolute frequency (cf. section 5). It may even be the case that an etymologically highly irregular word-form can be analyzed by a relatively small number of symbols (of its word-end), and the other way round.","In the horizontal progress of the algorithm (which corresponds to the answer l~nes - a new symbol is added) the output","ormation concerns a single word-end, while in the vertical progress (corresponding to the answer n oo- different symbols than the one(s) in question are added) it usually concerns more than one word-end. These word-ends can be labelled as complementary word-ends with respect to the horizontal word-end(s) in question; they consist of the same sequence of symbols as the correlated horizontal word- -ends with the exception of their respect-ive leftmost symbols, which belong to the complementary set of symbols of the alphabet with respect to the leftmost symbol(s) of the horizontal word-end(s), according to the combinatorics of letters in existing Czech words (for example, the complementary word-ends to the horizontal word- -ends /m~r, dm~r, #m~r are only four: ~m~r, ~__~__j.r, omer, ~ (the symbo_ / stands for the end of the word, i.e. indicates a word-end in the form of a full word-form)). Throughout the algorithm, the notation concerning the complementary word-ends is abbreviated in that in their place only their common output information is written (cf. the three occurrences of A in Pigure 1 below).","The conception just discussed can be illustrated by a chunk of the algorithm accounting for the frequent word- -inflection ending ~ (which is an adjectival word-ending, ambiguous among nominative and accusative singular masculine- -inanimate, and nominative singular masculine-animate, thus representing the adjectival \"normal form,'), which clashes only with /pr# (adverb), being accounted for by the three occurrences of the output information A (standing for the morphemic information in question) in Y~urel.","Figure 1.

KINDS OF INFC~ATION","The word-ends (i.e. the horizontal word-ends and the complementary word-ends with respect to the given horizontal word-ends) are assigned the following kinds of information.","A. r~orphemic information.","(i) The information concerning part-of- -speech categories includes the distinction between Nouns, Verbs (these kinds of information are further subcategorized), Adjectives (A), Adverbs (B), Prepositions (C), Conjunctiuns (D) and Pronouns (Zj) (there are distinguished three kinds of pronouns, namely those which function as nouns, those which functiomae adjectives, and those which function both ways).","(ii) The information concerning grammatical categories includes the following distinctions (with respect to the part- -of-speech categories).","(a) Declension.","(aa) Case (six cases, indicated as l, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) is distinguished not only with nouns, but due to grammatical agreement, also with adjectives and pro-no Ltns.","(bb) Number (singular and plural, indicated as sg and pl, respectively) is distinguished with nouns, and due to grammatical agreement, also with adjectives, pronouns and verbs.","(cc) Gender (combined with animateness) is distinguished with nouns, and due to grammatical agreement, partly also with adjectives, pronouns and verbs (with verbs, for example, in the past and passive participles plural). ~ith nouns, four genders are distinguished: masculine- -inanimate (N), masculine-animate (~), feminine (F), and neuter (S). The care T gory of animateness is involved rather with masculine then with feminine and neuter nouns because with plural masculine nouns the difference in animateness is present, due to grammatical agreement, also with verbs and adjectives in the above mentioned way, and because in technical texts substantially more masculine- -animate than feminine-animate nouns are found.","(b) Conjugation.","With verbs, there is distingtuished person (three persons, with the exception stated in section 4), number (cf. (bb) above), tense (present, past and future), mood (indicative and imperative), and voice (active and passive). As concerns notation, usually several kinds of information are collapsed in a single abbreviation, cf. K standing for the third person singular active indicative present.","There is no need of information concerning the in/lectional types of nouns, adjectives and verbs; for example the word-ends corresponding to the class of nouns represented by the word-forms katodami (by cathodes) and vlastnostmi (by properties) (both 7 pl)are assigned the same morphemic information, though the word-forms in question belong to etymologically quite different types of inflection of (feminine) nouns (of. the difference between the word-inflection endings, ami and m i, respectively).","B. Lemm~tization information.","Lemmatizatimn, i.e. convering an inflected word-form into the normal form (i.e. 1 sg with nouns, 1 sg masculine with adjectives and pronouns, and the infinitive form with verbs) has a specific purpose, being connected with those applications of morphemic analysis which concern the terminological elements of technical texts (such as automatic indexing).","In the present system, lemmatization is carried out by a retrograde erasing of a certain number of symbols (possibly zero) and by adding a number of specific symbols (possibly zero) to what has been left after the erasing; in lemmatization (unlike in the rest of the algorithm) we work with diacritic marks as specific symbols. In this way, lemmatization can be accounted for by means of several tens of simple and highly general rules, cutting across the inflectional endings and also across the inflectional types of different part-of-speech categories. It should be pointed out that lemmatization concerns rather the concrete words (word-forms) found in a text than the word-ends themselves: though the majority of the lemmatization rules operate on word-ends (concerning usually only a part of a word-end, which is close to a word-"]},{"title":"181","paragraphs":["-ending, cf. the s~mbol y in the word-end to_/~, corres~ondi~g to the word-form .catod~;), in exceFtional cases, ~or example where the stem of a word is affected by an alternation, the erasing may reach to the left of the concrete word, i.e. behind the word-end; cf. the word-end s.te (consisting of three symbols), which, with some simplifications, unambi£uously indicates a verb (K), but which is not sufficient for the lem~matization of such verb-forms as roste (grows) to their infinitives ~--'-~o ~rcw)), where four rightmest s~ls-~-~'~-2~of-the concrete word should be considere~.","The rules of le~matization have general-ly the form [X; abc...], where X stands for the number of the symbols to be erased, and abe..., for the specific symbols tc be added.

Evrooa (Zuro~e), rraha ~Prague), etc.). On thl~ solution, oT'o'r\"~xample, the accusative form of ~raha (F), namely Prahu, would yield a case of morphemically irresolvable ambiguity with the locative form of or~h (N; t.hreshold), namely prahu.

This ambiguity in gender, however, is not present on the underlying level of Czech, where only a single lexical item (masculine-inanimate noun) is hypothesized to occur, as corresponding to the two surface normal forms (i.e. masculine-inanimate and feminine), the two surface genders accidentally yielding ambiguity in the word-end (word-form) /~dk~.","(cc) Ambiguity concerning gender in combination with animateness (and case), cf. the word-end /~len (member), which is ambiguous between masculine-inanimate and masculine-animate noun (N l, 4 sg § 1 sg).

Panevov~ s list, not bein& lexically restricted with respect to specific applications, includes also proper names, words not occurring in technical texts and forms not analyzed by the present algorithm (such as singular imperative with verbs), but on the other hand, it consists only of full word-forms, thus intersecting with the present list, where first of all ambiguous word-ends in the form of parts of words are involved.","5. QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS","The present conception of the algorithm of morphemic analysis is based on the absolute frequency of word-ends in technical texts. In the ideal case, the word- -ends should be arranged with respect to the frequency of their last (rightmost), last-but-one, etc., symbols - a task which itself would require the aid of a computer; for the time being, we must 184 work with an approximation, which makes it necessary to divide the algorithm into two Farts according to the ass~nption that the first two hundred word-ends on the scale of absolute frequency, arranged according to a statistical examination concerning the whole word-ends, could resolve about fifty ~ercent of the words of ~ ~ technical text, while the other word-ends of the algorithm (pieces of output information), arranged according to the frequency of their last sD~bols, should resolve the remaim/~ ;ortion of a technical text• We assume that out of the about twenty thousand pieces of output information of the broadly conceived preliminary version of the algorithm, only several thousands will be sufficient to cover the words which may occur in a standard tecDmical text (this will lead to a substantial reduction of the preliminary version of the algorithm)•","The words included into the analysis fall into four major semantic hyper- -categories (not used in the semantic analysiu): (i) words with the most general semantics (including the forms of cate-orial verbs, Such as b_~ (to be), v reo~sitions, such as Z (in), etc.); (ii) general terms typical of technical texts (such as metoda (method), (system), ~tc.);'-~) words specific to the Liven technical domain, e.g. microelectronics (such as katoda (cathode), obvod (circuit),---~.), and (iv) words ~pical of other (possibly affiliated) domains (such as (brick), stTecha (reef), etc.).","The conception of the most frequent two h~dred word-ends (which are ar, a~ed in a s~ecial algoritl~m) can be ~luu.,~a by a list involving ten most _requon~ word-ends; in Czech technical ...... , they belong to the first hy~er- . a.~","\"0-\"\" c~ ~..
