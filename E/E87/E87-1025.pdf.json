Noun phrases do not refer at all. they all assert existence (with the exception of \"logica~ly proper names*', whose existence Russell could never prove). Example 3 would become \"I¢ is not the case that there is a donRey and John owns it\". and would become \"For every boy there is exactly one mother such that he loves her*'. Now the truth values for these sen-fences come out right. This interpretation is, accordingly, called the \"quantiflcational theory of noun phrases\". Under ¢hls analysis pronouns correspond ¢o the variables bound by quantlflers in First Order Predicate Calculus. Until recently most linguists and logicians saw no other solution to the problems exemplified by sentences 3 and ~ than ¢o adopt Russell's theory. But the quantlflcational theory of noun phrases does not seem to help in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2. Here the traditional referential theory still seemed to have much more explanatory power. But this meant, unfortunately, that noun phrases. inclusive pronouns, must be interpreted in (at least) two fundamentally different ways: In sinEle sentences such as 3 and as quantifiers and bound variables. respectively, without any referring function, and in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2 as referring expressions. But far worse, there are certain cases where neither of these interpretations seems possible. The best-known examples are the so-called donkey-sentences: 5) If John owns a donkey he is happy 6) If John owns a donkey he beats it The most natural translation of 5 is 7) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -> happy(john) where the indefinite article can be represented as an existential quantifier. and thls is in Keeping wlth our intuition: A valid paraphrase of this sentence is \"If there is some donkey that John owns he is happy'*.

The only syntactic difference between the two sentences is the pronominal reference to the noun phrase \"a donkey\", made in 6 but misslnE in 5. The manner in which an arbitrarily (in principle) far removed pronoun in the surface sentence can turn an existential quantifier into a universal one has been puzzlinE logicians and linguists for a lone time. The referential theory of noun phrases does not help, either, in these cases. We really are at a loss ¢o explain donRey sentences. But there are yet more functions of noun phrases, and in particular of pronouns, which seem to resist any straightforward logical or \"traditional'* interpretation: The Bach-Peters sentences, where pronouns point crosswise forward and bacRward (\"The pilot who shot at i_~ hit the MIE that chased him\"), and the so-called E-type pronouns, which point from outside into quantified statements ('*Few M.P.s came to the party but the~ had a good time** (Evans 1980:338). One particular Rind of the E-type pronouns will be given a lot of attention below.","1.3 Pronominal Reference in Discourse Representation Theory Kamp*s DRT and Helm's File Change Semantics are two (very similar) attempts ¢o unify the familiarity/novelty theory and the quantlficational theory of noun phrases and, as special cases, the referential theory and the bound-varlable theory of pronouns. Both authors took up an idea of Karttunen's (e.g. Karttunen 1976). viz. that we have to dlstinEuish between \"normal\" referents, i.e. real objects in the world (or a model of it). and special discourse referents whose existence in the discourse does not in itself say anything about the existence of any objects in the world (or the model). Indefinite noun phrases and proper names introduce (i.e. assert the existence of) new discourse referents. These discourse referents constitute the universe of discourse. The remaining information conrained in the sentence defines the conditions on the discourse referents. Now the conflict between the two interpretations of noun phrases can be resolved: We can \"refer*' (by means of definite noun phrases or definite pronouns) to discourse referents (this is the reference-familiarity component) bur these entities are not real world objects but something functionally similar to the variables used in quantified statements (this is the quantification component). Thls solution works for anaphoric linRs from inside a sentence (such as 6) as well as for those from outside (e.g. 2). i.e. we have a way to treat both isolated sentences and discourses.

For this reason both types of anaphora considered so far are usually called \"denotatlonal anaphora\". This name is unfortunate as it blurs the main idea behind this type of anaphora, viz. The fact that \"denotaTional anaphora\" is an abstraction of referential (or: denotatlonal) and non-referentlal (or: bound variable) uses of pronouns and other noun phrases.

We clearly speak about two different papers (whether they be individually known, as in 17, or taken Eenerally, as in 18). In DRT in its present form, a slnEle discourse referent would be created for \"a paper\", and if we made the \"one\" point to it we would Eet the wronE loEical interpretation (namely the one we would leEitlmately Eet if the pronoun were \"it\" ). We can get the correct interpretation if we treat the indefinite pronoun as a \"macro\", i.e. as an abbreviation for part of the precedlnE sentence. Before we actually interpret the sentence, this abbreviation must be \"macro-expanded\" (Hirst's expression: Hirst 1981:31). i.e replaced by a copy of the construction it anaphorically Points to. In The simple examples above we can actually copy the surface structure from the antecedent into the place of the pronoun. This was the explanation oriEinally used in TPansformatlonal Grammar for all types of pronominal reference, but it soon became clear that this view was too simple. It is sufficient To consider cases where the antecedent contains indexical expressions such as \"my\", as in \"I tot my paper accepted by 'Nature' Peter manaEed to Eet one accepted by 'Science'\". It is not synTactic expressions which Eet copied but some kind of \"loElcal form\", and the Theory that puts this view forward is accordlnEly known as \"idenTity-of-loEical-form theory\", or \"ILFT\" for short.

But They are definite, as They use both the definite pronoun \"it\". Furthermore. both of Them are ~enerlc, and so we consider this Type of sentence first. AEain, we have To expand pronouns into newly created discourse referents, and aEain we must determine what information has to be packed into these new discourse referents. But now it is a bit clearer than with indefinite descripTional anaphora how This can be accomplished. Intuitively it is clear That in sentence 18, for instance, the two instances of \"he\" (plus one which was elliptically deleted: \"... and he will carry ...\") must be expanded into three different discourse referents, correspondinE ¢o \"any hunter who has spotted a deer\", \"any hunter who has spotted and killed a deer\", and \"any hunter who has spotted, killed and cut up a deer\", respectively. Why do we have to use these successively more complicated expressions? Because of the definiteness of the pronoun. The function of the definite pronoun, as opposed to the indefinite one, becomes clear if we compare example 16 with 18. In 18 we talked about different (at least, potentially different) papers. In 16. how-ever, we speak about one single hunter, althouEh in different sTaEes of his deer-killinE activities. In other words, definite pronouns require uniqueness of their ultimate referent in the same way that definite noun phrases do. In the case of denotaTional pronouns in non-~eneric sen-Tences the uniqueness of the constants. used in HCL to encode existential quantification, itself enforces uniqueness of The ultimate referents. But in The case of descripTional anaphora in ~enerlc sentences it is not Trivial to enforce this referential uniqueness. As each Eeneric sentence ultimately Translates into an independent rule in The loEical representation we cannot establish uniqueness of a referent named in different rules by simply usinE the same variable name. This becomes quite obvious if we remember That any implementation of a HCL prover, such as ProloE, must create a new internal representation for the same variable name, when This name is used in different clauses. We can nevertheless enforce uniqueness of reference, even across Eeneric sentences which map into separate clauses, by addinE The consequences of each precedlnE clause to The conditions of The followinE one:","kills(H.D) :- hunter(H), deer(D), spoCs(H.D).","cuts_up(H.D) :- hunter(H), deer(D), sPoCs(H.D), kills(H,D).","carries_home(H,D):- hunter(H), deer(D), spots(H,D), kills(H,D), cuts_up(H,D).

It seems ¢o be this switch of Eenerlcness which makes the pronominal reference impossible in example la, and not the fact that we point into a quantified sentence, s But it is not necessary that the sentences concerned belonE to the same Eenericness cazeEorY. The first of the followinE examples is unacceptable but the second and third examples are acceptable, despite mixed Eenerlcness:"]},{"title":"23) * Whenever a farmer spots a donke~ he abuses it.

I've seen him before.

A pronoun in such a sentehce is therefore (in almost all cases) a denotational pronoun, trylnE to find an extensional value in an antecedent which could be used as its own denotation. Hence we will have to make sure that a denotatlonal pronoun accepts only representations of individuals (of the form \"c(X)\") in the precedlnE sentence(s), and that a failure to find them must result in the entire discourse becomlnE unacceptable. Thus the \"he\" and \"it\" in the second sentence of example 23 will try to find ~epresentations of individuals in the first sentence, but there are only representations of \"stereotypes\", i.e. meta-level names for object level variables (of the form \"v(X)\"). This makes denotatlonal anaphora impossible in this case.","3. Basically the same idea was developed by Bartsch 1979. ¢houEh not in the framework of DRT. She says that pronouns such as those in 15 and 16 refer to stereotypes of objects rather than to the objects themselves. However, we think she overstretches this idea by claimlnE that ordinary donkey-sentences must be explained by means of stereotypes, also. There are, after all, perfectly non-Eenerlc donkey-sentences, SUCh as \"Every farmer who bOUEh¢ a donkey slauEhtered"]},{"title":"154","paragraphs":["The same Problem does not arise in example 2~. Here we have an explicitly descrlptlonal pronoun (\"one\"), and it will not care about the type of value ~hat its antecedent has (i.e. whether it is \"c(X)\" oP \"v(X)'), as it will only use the antecedentts intension anyway. Example 25, finally, is acceptable because Eenerlc sentences can talk about either individuals o__rr \"stemeotypes\". AlthoUEh the third sentence (\"Whenever he spots It he abuses it.\") is Eeneric, the Pmonouns in it will first try to find denotations in their antecedents. In this case, they will succeed: The first sentence of 25 is non-Eenerlc and has, of course, created repPesentatlons of individuals (i.e. \"c(X)t'). Zf there had been no suitable extensional antecedents, the Pronouns would have started looklnE for intensional ones. This was the case in examples 15 and 16. In examples 19 to 22, finally, theme were actually extensional antecedent values,"]},{"title":"but","paragraphs":["praEmatlc considerations (i.e. world knowledEe) forces the hearer in these cases to drop the (formally possible) denotatlonal anaphora in favour of (definite) descrlptional anaphora. Just flndlnE intensional antecedents of descrlptlonal pronouns is, however, not enouEh: You have then to decide how much of the intension (often scattered over several discourse referents) has to be copied in the place of the pronoun.
