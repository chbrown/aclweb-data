A treatment of locative prepositional phrases is given, thus illustrating the generation of the situation schemata and their interpretation in situation semantics. Introduction","A natural language system aims to provide an overall framework for relating the linguistic form of utterances and their semantic interpretation. And the relation between the two must be algorithmic. In this paper we pursue an approach which is based on an algorithm for converting linguistic form to a format which we call a situation schema.","A situation schema has a well-def'med formal structure, suggestive of logical form. This is a structure which is different from the standard model-theoretic one; we will argue that it is a structure better adapted for the analysis of the meaning relation in natural languages. A situation schema is effectively calculable from the linguistic form and we believe that it provides a format usefull for further processing, e.g. in the construction of a natural language interface with a data system and also in connection with mechanical translation systems.","The general structure of situation schemata","We begin by explaining the general structure of the situation schemata and how they, are rooted in the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry (Barwise and Perry 83). Situation semantics is grounded in a set of","prinutives S situations R relations L locations D individuals The format of a bas/c (located)fact is","at I: r, al,...,an; 1","at 1: r, al ..... an; 0, the first expresses that at the location 1 in L the","relation r in R holds of the individuals al ..... an in D;","the second expresses that it does not hold.","A s/mat/an s in S determines a set of facts of the form in s:at l:r, al ..... an; 1 or in s:at l:r, al ..... an; 0.","We can think of a situation s as a kind of restricted, partial model (data base) which classifies certain basic facts. The set of primitives <S,L,R,D> may come with some internal structure, e.g. the set L of locations is or represents connected regions of space time and thus could be endowed with a rich geometric structure. We shall see how this can be exploited in our analysis of locative prepositional"]},{"title":"phrases.","paragraphs":["A situaion schema is a complex feature-value structure computable from the linguistic form of the utterance and with a choise of features matching the primitives of situation semantics: \"REL ARG1 - AEEm - LOC .POL -","Here the features REL ARG1,...,ARGn, arid LOC correspond to the primitives: relation, individuals, 258 location. POL, abbreviating polarity, takes either the value 1 or 0. The values in the schemata can either be atomic or complex feature-value structures. The value of the LOC feature is always complex.","The interpretation of a situation schema is relative to an utterance situation u and a described situation s. The utterence situation decomposes into two parts","d discourse situation","c the speaker's connections","The discourse situation contains information about who the speaker is, who the addressee is, the sentence uttered, and the discourse location. The latter information is necessary to account for the tense of a sentence. The speaker's connections is a map determining the speaker's meaning of lexical items. The meaning of a sentence ~ 1 is a relation between the utterance situation u (=d,c) and a described situation s. We write this relation d,c [srr.,h] s, where SIT. t)lden°tes the situation schema of 01.","Remark. In other works, e.g. (Fenstad et. al. 87), we have developed the mathematical study of the structures <S,L,R,D>; in particular, several axiomatization theoremes have been proved, providing a complete inference mechanism for a multi-sorted logic based on a semantics of partial information. Since the model theory of these sU'uctures seems to be a natural formalism for a (relational) data base theory, it would be interesting to build a PROLOGstyle system based on the proof-theory which we have developed."]},{"title":"Oblique objects and adjuncts","paragraphs":["In the next section the general theory will be illustrated by the analysis of a couple of sentences that contain locative prepositional phrases. In this section we make some preliminary remarks. See (Colban 85) or (Fenstad eL al. 87) for more details. The PP's we consider here are all attached to a verb (not a noun phrase), and will be divided into two classes: oblique objects and adjuncts (Kaplan and Bresnan 82). An oblique object fills one of the argument slots of the verb if one considers the verb to be a relation with a fixed number of arguments. In e.g. the sentence 'Tom handed the book to Anne\" the verb handed is a ternary relation with arguments Torn, the book and, one migth say, Anne. However, we will consider the third argument to be something that has to be in the relation to to Anne. An oblique object is thus a constraint on an (unexpressed) argument of the verb. This way a verb may have several oblique objects without the number of arguments necessarely increasing. In the sentence ''Tom sent a letter from Norway to France\" both from Norway and to France are constraints on the same argument.","Adjuncts function normally by restricting or modifying the relation expressed by the verb. Examples are: \"Tom played with Anne \" and \"Tom ate in a hurry. \" Sometimes the location where the relation takes place is modified and not the relation itself. In e.g. 'Tom ran to the car\" the location will be restricted to be in the relation to to the car. This relation will hold if the location is a curve Izacing the trajectory in space-time that ends at the (location of) the car.","The situation schemata in the examples below have been produced by a parser for LFG-grammars. Usually, f-structures are produced by such a parser, but we have written a grammar that causes situation schemata to be produced instead."]},{"title":"Examples","paragraphs":["Examvle"]},{"title":"1:","paragraphs":["¢1: Peter ran to the car.

The COND feature is a set (notice the set brackets) of constraints on IND2. The first one expresses that ND2 must be anchored to a location I that temporally precedes the location that 10 gets anchored to. By convention 10 is always anchored to the discourse location I d. This constraint accounts for the past tense of ran. In the second constraint the semantics of to tells us that 1 must be a curve in space-time that ends at the location of a. The head-relation run in SIT.~ 1 asserts that the individual named Peter is in the state of running along the trajectory 1. An interesting project would be to furnish the domain L of locations with a set of \"primitive\" relations which could be used to spell out the meaning of the different prepositions. For the moment the only primitive relation on L that has been accounted for in the axiomatizatlon of the structure <S,L,R,D> is \"<\", the relation \"temporally precedes.\" A more precise interpretation of S1T.O 1 is: The relation d,c [S1T.O1 ] s holds if and only if there exists an anchor g on S1T.~ I'I'£X~, i.e. ~0): ld g(IND2) < g(1 O)","andanextensienf ofg that anchorsIND1 such thatf(IND1) is the unique individual","such that in s: c(car),f(IND1); 1 such that in s: c(to), gtlND2),f(IND1); I ins: at g(IND2 ): c(run), c(Peter); I","Note that relations between locations can easily be extended to include individuals among their arguments.
