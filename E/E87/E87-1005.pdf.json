The words are structured by concatenating a stem with an inflectional part. In certain cases, phonological rules are added to the grammar in order to capture lexical phonological phenomena. i. Intu'oduction-Ovemview","Our processor is intended to provide an analysis as well as a generation for every derived item of the greek lexicon. It covers both inflectional and derivational morphology but for the time being only inflection has been treated.","Greek is the only language tested so far. Nevertheless, we hope that our system is general enough to be of use to other languages since the formal and computational aspect of \"validation grammars\" and finite automata has already been used for French (c.f. Courtin et al. 1976, Galiotou 1983).","The system is built around the following data files: I.A \"dictionary\" holding morphemes associated to morpho-syntactic information. 2.A \"model\" file containing items which act as reference to every morphematic entry in order to determine what kind of process the entry undergoes. 3.A word grammar which governs permissible word structures. The rules that can apply to an entry are divided in a. a \"basic initial rule\" acting as a recognition process.","b. The validation Pules that determine all possible combinations of the entry with other morphemes. 4. A list of phonemes described as sets of features. The same file contains also a set of phonological rules generating lexical phonological phenomena. These rules govern permissible correspondences between the form of entries listed in the dictionary and the form they develop when they are combined in sequences of morphemes.","These files are used both for analysis and generation. The process of the present morphological analysis consists of parsing an input of inflected words with respect to the word grammar. Stems associated to the appropriate morpho-syntactic information will be the output of the parsing.","The process of generation of a given inflected word consists of","a. determining its stem by a morphological analysis.","b. Generating all or a subset of the permissible word forms.","For the needs of this presentation, lexical items have been transcribed in a semi-phonological manner. According to this transcription,all greek vowels written as double character are kept as such: (1) Gmaphemes Phonemes o~ ~ oi ~u ~ ai OH ~ oy Moreover, the sounds [i] and [o~ written in Greek as n and ~ respectively are transcribed as i: and o:. The transcription of the last two vowels reminds of their ancient greek status as long vowels.","As far as accent is concerned, we decided to exclude this aspect from the present form of the processor. Accentuation in Greek is a linguistic problem which has not been solved as yet. We are working on this matter and we hope to implement accent in the near future.","The morphological processing is controlled by a finite automaton I with the help of the dictio-T--F~r-a detailed discussion on the control automaton, c.f.Courtin et al 1969."]},{"title":"26","paragraphs":["namy and the word grammar which controls word for-marion and carries out the transmission of The linguistic information needed for the processing.

As such, they contribute to the categorial specifications of the words. Moreover, all morpho-syntactic features of inflectional affixes ape also copied to the word. In word structures built in the form of a tree, features ape percolated to the mother node according to the Percolation Principle as it was formulated by Selkirk. (i) Percolation Principle (Selkirk 1982)","a. If a head has a feature specification [aFi], a~u, its mother node must be specified [aFi] and vice versa. b. If a non head has a feature specification uSfj] and the head has the feature specification Fjj, then the mother node must have the feature specification ~Fj].

Feature values may also be inserted to certain underspecified environments. For instance, when an inflected word fails to take certain features fl~om both the stem and the ending, the rule then takes over the role of adding them. Consider the verbal form 71\"afo: \"I write\". It takes the category value from the stem (TTaf-) and the features of person and number from the affix (-o:). It is clear that at this point, 7Taro: is underspecifled because besides the values of person and number, greek verbal forms must be characterized by aspect, tense and voice. Following this, we assume that specific values of the last three attributes are inserted by the rule governing the combination of the stem ymaf- with the ending -o:.","(3) Rule generating 7mafo:","rule(vll,Stem,[],StFeat,_, Affix,[],AfFeat, AfVal, Result,[],ResFeat, AfVal):- Concat(Stem,Affix,Result), feat ins(StFeat~[non__perf,present,","-- activeJ,AfFeat,ResFeat)"]},{"title":"28","paragraphs":["IT is worth noting that a validation rule can also take into account instances of morpho-phonological phenomena. #.2.1 Morpho-phonological insertion","In Greek, in several cases, transition elements appear at a morpheme boundary between Two consti-Tuents (c.f.Ralli 1987).

Rules performing phonological changes are applied cyclically each time the appropriate lexical string is formed. Phonological rules take into account a list of phonemes described as sets of distinctive features. In our system, phonemes are listed as Prolog terms. Phonological rules are listed as Prolog clauses.","Take for example the form 6e-s-ame \"we tied\". The stem 6e- is listed in the dictionary as 6en-. The validation rule authorizing the concatenation of 6en- and -s- demands the application of a lexical phonological rule responsible for the deletion of the final Inl. ~.2.3 The augment rule","It is generally accepted that augment in Modern Greek must be considered as a phonological element introduced in the appropriate morphological environment. That is, an e- is prefixed to forms marked for past in which it is always accentuated. Given the fact that accentuation is not treated here, we decided to divide verbal stems in marked and un-marked for augment. Once a verbal item is built, the e- is added at the beginning of the form in singular and third person plural only if the stem carries the feature [aug].","In our system, the augment rule, listed also as a Prolog clause, is activated by validation rules authorizing the concatenation of a verbal stem and a verbal affix marked for past.
