An abstract for the book follows.","ABSTRACT","This study presents an original and penetrating analysis of the complex problems surrounding the automatic generaton of natural language text. Laurence Danlos provides a valuable critical review of current research in this important and increasingly active field, and goes on to describe a new theoretical model that is thoroughly grounded in linguistic principles.","The model emphasizes the semantic, syntactic and lexical constraints that must be dealt with when establishing a relationship between meaning and form, and it is consideration of such linguistic constraints that determines Danlos' generation algorithm. The book concludes with a description of a generation system based on this algorithm which produces texts in several domains and also a system for the synthesis of spoken messages from semantic representations.","The book is a significant addition to the literature on text generation~ and will be of particular interest to all computational linguists and AI researchers who have wrestled with the problem of vocabulary selection."]}]}
