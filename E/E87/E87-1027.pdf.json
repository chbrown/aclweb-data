The grammar formalism is motivated by the linguistic approach (adopted at GETA) where a multilevel interpretative structure is associated to a sentence. The topology of the multilevel structure is 'meaning' motivated, and hence its substructures may not correspond projectively to the substrings of the related sentence.","Grammar formalisms have been developed for various purposes. Generative-Transformational Grammars, General Phrase Structure Grammars, Lexical Functional Gr-mmar, etc. were designed to be explanatory models for human language performance, while others like the Definite Clause Grammars were more geared towards direct interpretability by machines. In this naper, we introduce a declarative grammar formalism for the task of establishing the relation between on one hand a set of strings of terms and on the other a set of structural representations - a structural representation being in a form amenable to processing (say for translation into another language), where all and only the relevant conten~.s or 'meaning' (in some sense adequate for the purpose) of the related string are exhibited. The grammar can also be interpreted to perform analysis (given a string of terms, to produce a structural representation capturing the 'meaning' of the string) or to perform generation (given a structural representation, to produce a string of terms whose meaning is captured by the said structural representation).","It must be emphasised here that the grammar writer is at liberty (within certain constraints)to design the structural representation for a given string of terms (because its topology is independent of the derivation tree of the grammar), as well as the nature of the correspondence between the two (for example, according to certain linguistic criteria). The grammar formalism is only a tool for expressing the structural representation, the related string, and the correspondence. The formalism is motivated by the linguistic approach (adopted at GETA) where a multilevel in~rpretative structure is associated to a sentence. The multilevel structure is 'meaning' motivated, and hence its substructures may not correspond projectively to the substrings of the related sentence The characteristic of the linguistic approach is the design of the multilevel structures, while the grammar formalism is the tool (notation) for expressing these multilevel structures, their related sentences, and the nature of the correspondence between the two. In this paper, we present only the grammar formalism ; a discussion on the linguistic approach can be found in [Vauquois 78] and [Zaharin 87].","For this grammar formalism, a structural representation is given in the form of a labeled tree, and the relation between a string of terms and a structural representation is defined as a mapping between elements of the set of substrings of the string and elements of the set of subtrees of the tree : such a relation is called a string-tree correspondence.

(Then again, this is the string-tree correspondence we wish to express for our examples - recall the remark earlier saying that the grammar writer is at liberty to define the nature of the string-tree correspondence he or she desires, and this is done in the rules, see later).

The aim of this paper is to introduce the tool, in the form of a grammar formalism, which can define such string-tree correspondence as well as be interpretable for analysis and for generation between strings of terms and structural representations.","The grammar formalism for such a purpose is called the String-Tree Correspondence Grammar (STCG). The STCG is a more formal version of the Static Grammar developed by [Chappuy 83] [Vauquois & Chappuy 85]. The Static Grammar (shortly later renamed the Structural Correspondence Specification Grammar), was designed to be a declarative grammar formalism for defining linguistic structures and their correspondence with strings of utterances in natural languages. It has been extensively used for specification and documentation,as well as a (manua$ reference for writing the linguistic programs (analysers and generators) in the machine translation system ARIANE-78 [Boitet-et-al 82]. Relatively large scale Static Grammars have been written for French in the French national machine translation project [Boitet 86] translating French intoEnglis~ and for Malay in the Malaysian national project [Tong 86] translating English to Malay ; the two projects share a common Static Grammar for English (naturally). The STCG derives its formal properties from the Static Gra~mmar, but with more formal definitions of the properties. In the passage from the Static Grammar to the STCG, the form as well as some other characteristics have undergone certain changes, and hence the change to a more appropriate name. The STCG first appeared in [Zaharin 86], where the formal definitions of the grammar are given (but under the name Of the Tree Correspondence Gran~nar).","A STCG contains a set of correspondence rules, each of which defines a correspondence between a structural representation (or rather a set or family of) and a string of terms (similarly a set or family of).

For example, it is indeed possible to change the label of node 2 to something else, or to move the node to the right of node 4, or even to exclude the node altogether. In short, the string-tree correspondence defined by a rule need not be projective.","Such elementary rules el...cz ~8 (with ul,..,u_ terms) can be generahsed to a form where each e.\"(i-l,..,n) represents a string of terms, say A..

Even if it does, one cannot be certain that it would be the string of terms one wishes to include in the rule - after all, two entirely different strings of terms may correspond to the same tree (a paraphrase) by means of two different rules.","We shall discard the alternative and adopt the first approach.The generalised rule ~l,..~n~8 (with each u. being the name of a rule) can be extended furthe~ by letting u. be a list of rule names,","•","1 where this is Interpreted as a choice for the string-tree correspondence A.'-T. to be referred to, and hence the choice for th~ist~ing of terms A. represented by u..

For these reasons, we specify each ~. as a pairI(REFERENCE, STRUCTURE) where REFERENCEIis the said list of rule names and STRUCTURE is a tree schema containing variables, such that the structure represents the tree found on the right hand side of the \"~\" in each rule referred to in the list REFERENCE. This way, the tree 8 can be defined in terms of T i by means of the variables (for example those appearing simultaneously in both u. and 8). See the example later in fig. 5 for an i illustration.

The rule RN2 describes a correspondence between two or more terms and a single tree - note the recursive REFERENCE in the first element of RN2 (for example, it gives the structural representation for \"catcher hunter\" as well as for \"dog catcher hunter\", see later in fig. 5).","The entry STRUCTURE of an element may also act as a constraint by making explicit certain nodes in the STRUCTURE instead of just a node dominating a forest (we have no examples for this in this paper, but one can easily visualise the idea).

The grammar stresses not only the fact that one can express string-tree correspondence like the ones we have discussed, but also that it can be done in a 'natural' way using the formalism - meaning the structures and correspondence are explicit in the rule, and not implicit and dependent on the combination of grammar rules applied (as in derivation trees). The inclusion of the substring-subtree correspondence is also another characteristic of the grammar formalism. One also sees that the grammar is declarative in nature, and thus it is interpretable both for analysis and for generation (for example, by ~nterpretlng the rules as tree rewriting rules with variables}.","In an effort to demonstrate the principal properties of the formalism, the STCG presented in this paper is in a simple form, ie. treating trees with each node having a single label. In its general form, the STCG deals with labels having considerable internal structure (lists of features, etc.). Furthermore, one can also express constraints on the features in the nodes - on individual nodes or between different nodes. As mentioned, the concepts of direct derivation (=>) and derlvatzon (->), as well as the derivation tree are also defined for the STCG. (Note that the rules with properties similar to the rule $2 entail a definition of direct derivation which is more complex than the classical definition). The set of rules in a grammar forms a formal grammar, ie. it defines a language, in fact two languages, one of strings and the other of trees.","At the moment, there is no large applications of the STCG, but as the STCG derives its formal properties from the Static Grammar, it would be quite a simple process to transfer applications in the Static Grammar into STCG applications. Like the Static Grammar, the STCG is basically a formalism for specification, but given its formal nature, one also aims for direct interpretability by a machine. Though still incomplete, work has begun to build such an interpreter [Zajac 86].
