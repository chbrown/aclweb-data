It is able to recognize in real time natural language sentences, composed with words from a dictionary of 6500 items, dictated by a speaker with short pauses among them. The system is speaker dependent, before using it the speaker has to perform the training stage reading a predefined text 15-20 minutes long. It runs on an architecture composed by an IBM 3090 mainframe and a PC/AT based workstation with signal processing equipments. PROBABILISTIC APPROACH","The problem of recognizing human voice is approached in a probabilistic manner. I_~t W = w 1, w 2 ..... w n be a sequence of n words, and let A be the acoustic information extracted from the speech signal, from which the system will try to identify the pronounced words. P(WI~) i...ndieates the probability that the the sequence of words W has been spoken, once we observe the acoustic string A\" produced at the end of the signal processing stage.

To find the word sequence which maximizes the third term in the preceding equation, it is sufficient to find the sequence which maximizes the numerator; P(A) is, in fact, clearly not dependent on any W. Then, the recognition task can be decomposed in these problems:","1. perform an acoustic processing able to extract from the speech signal an information A representative of its acoustic features, and, at the same time, adequate for a statistical analysis; 3. create an acoustic model which makes it possible to evaluate P(A'[ W-~_), that is the probability that the acoustic string A will be produced when the speaker pronounces the word string W; create a language model giving the prob._ability P(IV) that the speaker will wish to pronounce W; find, among all possible sequences of words, the most probable or,e. F, ven with small vocabularies it is not feasible to ~.onduct an exhaustive search; so, we need to identify an efficient search strategy. ACOUSTIC PROCESSING","Acoustic processing is performed in the acoustic front-end forrned by an acquisition stage (microphone, filter, amplifier, A~I) converter) and a processing stage. The analog to digital converter gives a numeric representation of the signal picked up by the microphone, constituted by 20000 samples/see., each of 12 bits. Every 10 milliseconds an acoustic vector of 20 parameters is computed describing, through its spectral features, the behavior of speech signal for that interval. This operation takes into account recent studies on physiology of the human ear and on psychology of sound,, perccption. The signal energy in several frequency bands is determined through a Fourier analysis 161. Width of bands is n~}l uniform; it grows with frequency. This is in accordance with the behavior of the cochlea that has a better resolution power at low frequencies. Furthermore, compulation of parameters considers other features of auditory system, as dynamic adaptation to signal level.","Each acoustic vector is then compared with a set of 200 prototype vectors and the closest prototype is chosen to represent it; the label of this prototype (a number from I to 200), will then be substituted to th__e original vector. Therefore, the acoustic information ,4 is formed by a sequence of labels al, a2,\"\" , with a considerable reduction in the amount of data needed to represent the speech signal. ACOUSI\"IC MODEl.,","The acoustic model must compute the probability P(A IW) that lhe pronunciation of word string I,V will produce the hd~el string A. To design the acoustic model it is esscnlial t- understand the relationship between words and sounds of a language. With sounds of a language we mean those particular sounds usually generated during speaking. Ph(~netics is helpful in this task. Experts in linguistics usually classify sounds in classes, called phonemex [2]. The same phoneme can be representative of many different sounds, but they are completely equivalent from a linguistic point of view. The Italian language is usually described with 31 phonemes; in our system we use an extended set composed of 56 phonetic elements, to take into account particular aspects of the process of pronunciation not considered by the usual classification: coarticulation, different behavior in stressed and non-stressed vowels, pronunciation of w~wels and fricatives by people from different regi(ms. F, ach word in the language can be phonetically described by a sequence of phonemes,"]},{"title":"80","paragraphs":["representing the sequence of basic sounds that compose it. So, it is very useful to build up the acoustic model starting from phonemes.","For each phoneme, a Markov source i\"51 is defined, which is a model representing the phenomenon of producing acoustic labels during pronunciation of the phoneme itself. Markov sources can be represented by a set of states and a set of transitions among them. Every 10 milliseconds a transition takes place and an acoustic label is generated by the source. Transitions and labels are not predetermined, but are chosen randomly on the basis of a probability distribution. Starting from phoneme models, we can build models for words, or for word strings, simply by concatenating the Markov sources of the corresponding phonemes. Figure 1 shows a typical structure for Markov model of a phonetic unit and figure 2 the structure of the Markov model for a word.","The structure of Markov models is completely defined by the number of states and by interconneetions among them. It is unique for all the phonemes and for all the speakers and has been determined on the basis of intuitive considerations and experimental results, because no algorithm is known to find the best structure to describe such a phenomenon. The different behavior in different phonemes and in the voice of different speakers is taken into account in the evaluation of the model parameters: probability of transition between pair of states and probability of emission of labels. This evaluation, executed inthe training stage, is performed, given the word sequenc~ ~_ If: of training text and collected the acoustic label string A from the front-end, accordingly to the maximum likelihood criterion [l-I, maximizing the probability P(A't W). A speaker, during training, does not have to pronounce all the words in the dictionary; on the other hand, it is necessary that the text to be read contains all the phonemes of the language, each of them well represented in a great variety of phonetic contexts.","in the recognition stage the term P(A'I W) is computed on the basis of statistical parameters determined during the training; then it is necessary to evaluate the probability that the Mar._kov source for the word string W will emit the label string A, going from its initial state to its final one. This must be done summing the probability of all the paths of this kind, but it could be eomputationally very heavy and impractical to count them all because._their number depends exponentially on the length of A. Using dynamic programming techniques, it is possible to reach this goal limiting the amount of calculation to be done. The forward pass algorithm 1\"5], is, in._ fact, computationally linearly dependent on the length of A. LANGUAGE MODEL","__The language model is used to evaluate the probability P(W) of the word sequence m.

Wl) , that is, given the beginning of a sentence Wl, w 2 .... , Wk_ 1 , to evaluate the probability of words in the vocabulary to be at place k in the sentence, or, in other terms, to estimate the probability of the word to appear in that context.","if we ignore the language model (that means considering words as equiprobable), it would be impossible to distinguish omophones, (acoustically equivalent words), and it would be very hard to recognize correctly very similar words on the basis of the acoustic information only. The estimation of probabilities could be based on grammatical and semantic information, but a practical and easy way to use this approach has not been found yet. For this reason, in our approach the language model is built up from the analysis of statistical data. They have been collected from a huge set (corpus) of Italian sentences (in all, about 6 millions of words).

It is based on a very simple idea and, for this reason, its statistics can be built very easily only counting all the sequences of three consecutive words present in the corpus. On the other band, its predictive power is very high. if the information given by the language model were not available, in every context there would be uncertainty about the next word among all the 6500 words in the dictionary. Using the trigram model, uncertainty is, on the average, reduced to the","Figure 2. Typical structure for Markov model of a word"]},{"title":"81","paragraphs":["choice of a word among 100-110. In the procedure of estimating the language model statistics, a problem comes out: the probability of trigrams never observed in the corpus must be evaluated. For a 6500-word dictionary the number of different trigrams is about 270 billions; but from a corpus of 6 millions of words, only 6 millions of trigrams can be extracted, and not all of them are different. It is clearly evident that, even with the availability of a bigger corpus, it is not possible to estimate probabilities of trigrams by their relative frequencies. Trigrams never seen in the corpus must be considered allowable, although not very probable, otherwise it could be impossible to recognize a sentence containing one of them. To overcome this problem, some techniques have been developed, giving a good estimate of probability of never observed events [3].","Sentences in the corpus are taken from economy and finance magazines, and, as a consequence, the model is capable to work well on phrases about this topic, worse on other subjects. Clearly, the availability of corpus on different topics could be very useful in order to use the language model in different contexts. Nevertheless, some studies demonstrate that language model could be still fruitfully used for a matter different to the main one, if the collected data are enriched with a small corpus (about 1-2% the dimension of the main one) related to the new subject. This technique is used to allow the recognition of sentences not on finance and economy.","Figure 3 shows the coverage of the corpus on texts of economy and finance as a function of the vocabulary size. SEARCH STRATEGY","To find the word sequence W which maximizes the term P(WIA) , it is not feasible to consider all the sequences that can be built with words in the dictionary. For this reason an efficient search strategy is used that limits the investigation to a small fraction of the allowed word strings. The sequences generable with the N words in the dictionary can be represented by a tree. N branches, corresponding to the first word in the sentence, go out From the root, one For each word in the dictionary. Each branch ends in a new node, From which other N branches are generated for the second word in the sentence, and so on. A node in the tree defines univocally a sequence of words, constituted by words corresponding to branches in the path from the root to tile node itself. During the recognition process, tree nodes are explored, and, for each of them, the probability (ac(~ustical and linguistical) that the sentence will start with the corresponding words is computed. Nodes with a low probability are discarded; among the remaining nodes, the path that seems, so Far, the more probable is extended. This choice can be modified during the process, selecting at any time the best current path. This strategy, usually called slack sequential decoding, leads, in general, to the requested solution: the most probable sentence [4].","The extension of a path from a node is done analyzing all the branches going out From it, that means all the words in the vocabulary. It is computationally not practical to determine the acoustic likelihood of each word through the forward pass algorithm. The problem of a Fast access to a great dictionary is one of the most important topics in"]},{"title":"100~ [ 9s I 90 85 8O 75 70","paragraphs":["............................. $.-. ! i ........................... / ............. !-"]},{"title":"4.000 8000 12000","paragraphs":["Figure 3.
