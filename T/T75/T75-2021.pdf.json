For example, Waltz's program [Waltz 1972] is the latest in a line of development called scene analys, which was originated by Guzman [1968], and pursued by Huff man [1970] and Clowes [1971]. The usefulness' of this appro;ich is called into question by the difficulty of extracting, from information about intensity and color, the near perfect line drawing that such programs require; and by the restricted nature of the line drawing represeniation itself~ Waltz has demonstrated\" that when a more detailed categorization of the kinds of labels is made that the number of ambiguous line drawings decreases dramatically. \"","We greatly admire Waltz's program, .but we f~l that the apprOach that it embodies is open to several criticisms. The first"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["that the knowledge that it uses is in a certain sense not explicit enough. Although it contains a great deal of. information about the appearance of line drawings, this information is essentially, in a compiled form: one reflection of this ts that the structure of Waitz's program makes it inherently unable to use either explicit information about the three-dimensional form of what is being viewed, orthe many pieces of special and general knowledge that we surely bring to bear on the process of seeing.' Essentially, the only way one.can attempt to influence the program is by adding or deleting junctions from a large table of \"legal\" labellings. There is no way in which pieces of its knowledge can be pulled out and examined while tt tries to create an interpretation of, for example, a scene in which several lines are missing. Unless such knowledge, suitably embedded in a hypothetico-deductive system, can play a large part in the operation ofa vision program, we see no prospect of such a program being able to interpret the incomplete information that is the diet of daily life.

The fundamental • principle of resolution, that (- A) and {A v B,) together imply B, is occasionally useful, But attempting to make a uniform resolution proof procedure, to mechanize deduction in a way that cannot be very sensitive to hints, hunches, and a wide variety or higher level knowledge about the particular domain in question, is a cul-de-sac. Similarly, the line and vertex labels are local, predicates that are occasionally useful, and are of •some mathematical interest in their own right: but the problem of creating a uniform procedure to label arbitrary line drawing is not a central one for vision. Hence, we believe that the kind of knowledge contained in Waltz's program is probably relatively unimportant; and that the way in which it is made available there is certainly too restricting.","The proper endeavor of vision research is to decide what k.nowledge should be used to help a vision system to see, and to discover methods that make it possible to use such knowledge.
