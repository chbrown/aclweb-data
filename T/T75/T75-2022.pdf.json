This is a remembered framework to be adapted to fit reality by changing details as necessary.","A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation like being in a certain kind of living room or going to a child's birthday party. Attached to each frame are several kinds of information. Some of this information is about how to use the frame. Some is about what one can expect to happen next. Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed.","We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations. The \"top levels\" of a frame ere fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation. The lower levels have many terminals -- \"slots\" that must be filled by specific instances or data. Each terminal can specify conditions its assignments must meet. (The assignments themselves are usually smaller \"subframes.\") Simple conditions are specified by markers that might require a terminal assignment to be a person, an object of sufficient value, or a pointer to a sub-frame of a certain type. More complex conditions can specify relations among the things assigned to several terminals.","Collections of related frames are linked together into frame-systems. The effects of important actions ere mirrored by transformations between the framesof a system. These are used to make certain kinds of calculations economical, to represent changes of emphasis and attention, and to account for the effectiveness of \"imagery.\"","For visual scene analysis, the different frames of a system describe the scene from different viewpoints, and the transformations between one frame and another represent the effects of moving from place to place. For non-visual kinds of frames, the differences between the frames of a system can represent actions, cause-effect relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint. Different frames of a system share th._~e same terminals; this is the critical point that makes it possible to coordinate information gathered from different viewpoints.","Much of the phenomenological power of the theory hinges on the inclusion of expectations and other kinds of presumptions. A frame's terminals are normally already filled with \"default\" assignments. Thus'~ frame may contain a great many details whose supposition is not specifically warranted by the situation. These have many uses in representing general information, most likely cases, techniques for by-passing \"logic,\" and ways to make useful generalizations.","The default assignments are attached loosely to their terminals, so that they can be easily displaced by new items that fit better the current situation. They thus can serve also as =variables\" or as special cases for \"reasoning by example,\" or as \"textbook cases,\" and often make the use of logical quantifiers unnecessary.","The frame-systems are linked, in turn, by an information retrieval network. When a proposed frame cannot be made to fit reality -- when we cannot find terminal assignments that suitably match its terminal marker conditions -- this network provides a replac:ement frame. These interframe structures make possible other ways to represent knowledge about facts, analogies, and other information useful in understanding.","Once a frame is proposed to represent a situation, a matching process tries to assign values to each frame's terminals, consistent with the markers at each place. The matching process is partly controlled by information associated with the frame (which includes information about how to deal with surprises) and partly by knowledge about the system's current goals. There are important uses for the information, obtained when a matching process fails; it can be used to select an alternative frame that better suits the situation."]},{"title":"LOCAL ~1~1~ ~LOS~L T1~EOK~E~ FO~ Vt~I01~","paragraphs":["When we enter a room we seem to see the entire scene at a glance.

This is a more technical question than it might seem. At the level of detecting elementary visual features, texture elements, stereoscopic and motion-parallax cues, it is obvious that parallel processing might be useful. At the level of IFouping features into objects, it is harder to see exactly how to use parallelism, but one can at least conceive of the aggregation of connected \"nuclei\" (Guzman TR-228), or the application of boundary line constraint semantics (Waltz TR-271), performed in a special parallel network.","At \"higher\" levels of cognitive processing, however, one suspects fundamental limitations in the usefulness of parsllelism.

Let us separate, at once, the two issues: is imagery symbolic? and is it based on two-dimensional fragments? The first problem is one of degree; sure!y everyone would agree that at some level vision is essentially symbolic. The quarrel would be between certain naive conceptions on one side -- in which one accepts seeing either as picture-like or as evoking imaginary solids -- against the confrontation of such experimental results of Piaget (1956) and others in which many limitations that one might fear wou!d result from symbolicrepresentations ere shown actually to exist!","As for our second question: the issue of two-vs, three-dimensions evaporates at the symbolic evel. The very concept of dimension becomes inappropriate. Each type of symbolic representation of an object serves some goals well and others poorly. If we attach the relation labels left-of~ right-o_~f and abo~'e between parts of the structure, Say, as markers on pairs of terminals, certain manipulations • will work out smoothly; for example, some properties of these relations are \"invariant\" if we rotate the cube while keeping the same face on the table.

But if we turn the cube on its side such predictions become harder to make; people • have great difficulty keeping track of the faces of a sixcolored cube if one makes them roll it around in their mind.","If one uses instead more \"intrinsic\" relations like next-to and opposite-t_o,o then turning the object on its side disturbs the \"image\" much less. In Winston's thesis we see how systematic replacements (e.g., of *left\" for \"behind,\" end \"right\" for \"in-front-of\") can deal with the effect of spatial rotation.","Visual experience seems continuous. One reason is that we move continuously. A deeper explanation is that our \"expectations\". usually interact smoothly with our perceptions. Suppose you were to leave a room, close the door, turn to reopen it, and find an entirely different room. You would be shocked, The sense of change would be hardly less striking if the world suddenly changed before your eyes. A naive theory of phenomenological continuity is that we see so quickly that our image changes as fast as'does the scene. There is an alternative theory: the changes in one's frame-structure representation proceed at their own pace; the system prefers to make small changes whenever possible; and the•illusion of continuity is due to the persistence of assignments to terminals common to th__ee different view-frames. Thus, continuity depends on the confirmation of expectations which in turn depends on rapid access to remembered knowledge about the visual world.","Just before you enter a room, you usually know enough to \"expect\" a room rather than, say, • landscape.

We do not connect ~ each town to every other; but construct main routes, connecting the centers.of larger groups. Within such an organization, each member has direct links to some other individuals at his own \"level,\" mainly to nearby, highly similar ones; but each individual has also at least a few links to \"distinguished\" members of higher level groups. The result is that there is usually a rather short sequence between any two individuals, if one can but find it.","At each level, .the aggregates usually have distinguished loci or capitols. These serve as elements for clustering at the next level of aggregation. There is no nonstop airplane service between New Haven and Sen Jose because it is more efficient overall to share the \"trunk\" route between New York and San Francisco, which are the capitols at that level of aggregation.","The non-random convergences and divergences of the similarity pointers, for each difference ~ thus tend to structure our conceptual .world around ' (l). the aggregation into d-clusters (2) the selection of d_-capitols Note that it is perfectly all right to have several capitols in a clusterj so that there need be no one attribute common to them all.

You believe that there is an electricity shortage and blame the generator.","The generator can be represented as a mechanical system: the rotor has a pulley wheel ,driven by a belt from the engine. Is the belt tight enough? Is it even there? The output, seen mechanically, is a cable to the battery or whatever. Is. it intact? Are the bolts tight? Are the brushes pressing on the commutator?","Seen electrically, the generator is described differently. The rotor is seen as a flux-linking coil, rather than as a rotating device. The brushes and commutator are seen.as electrical switches. The output is current along a pairof conductors leading from the brushes through control circuits to the battery.","The differences between the two frames are substantial. The entire mechanical chassis of the car plays the simple role, in the electrical frame, of one of the battery connections. The diagnostician has to use both representations. A failure of current to flow often means that an intended conductor is not acting like one. For this case, the basic transformation between the frames depends on the fact that electrical continuity is in general equivalent to firm mechanical attachment. Therefore, any conduction disparity revealed by electrical measurements should make us look for a corresponding disparity in the mechanical frame. In fact, since \"repair ~ in this universe is synonymous with \"mechanical repair,\" the diagnosis must end in the mechanical frame. Eventually, we might ocate a defective mechanical junction and discover a loose connection, corrosion, wear, or whatever.","One cannot expect to have e frame exactly right for any problem or expect always to be able to invent one. But we do have a good deal to work with, and it is important to remember the contribution of one's culture in assessing 'the complexity of problems people seem to solve.

Cooling, for example, is already subdivided into fluid circulation, air flow, thermostasis, etc. Most \"ordinary\" problems are presumably solved by systematic use of the analogies provided by the transformations between pairs of these structures. The huge network of knowledge, acquired from school, books, apprenticeship, or whatever is interlinked by difference and relevancy pointers. No doubt the culture imparts a good deal of this structure by its conventional use of the same words in explanations of different views of e subject.","Over the past decade, it has become widely recognized how important are the details of the representation of a \"problem space\"; but it was not so well recognized that descriptions can be useful to a program, as well as to the person writing the program Perhaps progress was actually retarded by ingenious schemes to avoid explicit manipulation of descriptions.

I I I I 1 I i | t I I i ! l I I t I","paragraphs":["The central goal of a Theory of Problem Solving is to find systematic ways to reduce the extent of the Search through the Problem Space. Sometimes a simple problem is indeed solved by trying a sequence of \"methods\" until one is found to work. Some harder problems are solved by a sequence of local improvements, by \"hill-climbing\" within the problem space. But even when this solves a particular problem, it tells us little about the problem-space; hence yielding no improved future competence. The best-developed technology of Heuristic Search is that of game-playing using tree-pruning, plausible-move generation, and terminal-evaluation methods. But even those systems that use hierarchies of symbolic goals do not improve their understanding or refine their understanding or refine their representations. But there is a more mature and powerful paradigm: The primary purpose in problem solving should be better to understand the problem.space, to find representations within which the problems are easier to solve. The purpose of search is to get information for this reformulation, not -- as is usually assumed -- to find solutions; orce the space is adequately understood, solutions to problems will more easily be found. The value of an intellectual experiment should be assessed along the dimension of success ~ partial success - failure, or in terms of \"improving the situation\" or \"reducing a difference.\" An application of a \"method,\" or a reconfiguration of a representation can be valuable if it leads to a way to improve the strategy of subsequent trials. Earlier formulations of the role of heuristic search strategies did not emphasize these possibilities, although they are implicit in discussions of \"planning.\"","Papert (1972; see also Minsky 1972) is correct in believing that the ability to diagnose and modify one's own procedures is a collection of specific and important \"skills.\" Debugging, a fundamentally important component of intelligence, has its own special techniques and procedures. Every normal person is pretty good at them. or otherwise he would not have learned to see and talk! Goldstein (AIM-305) and Sussman (TR-297) have designed systems which build new procedures to satisfy multiple requirements by such elementary but powerful techniques as:","I. Make a crude first attempt by the first order met~hod of simply putting together procedures that separately achieve the individual goals.","2. If something goes wrong, try to characterize one of the defects as a specific (and • undesirable) kind of interaction between two procedures.","3. Apply a \"debugging technique\" that, according to a record in memory, is good at repairing that specific kind of interaction.","4. Summarize the experience, to add to the \"debugging techniques library\" in memory. These might seem simple-minded, but if the new problem is not too radically different.from the old ones, then they have a good,chance to work, especially if one picks out the right first-order approximations. If the new problem is radically different, one should not expect any learning theory to work well. Without a structured cognitive map -- without the \"near misses\" of Winston, or a cultural supply of good training sequences of problems -- we should not expect radically new paradigms to appear magically whenever we need them."]},{"title":"gO~E F~EhEV~RT F~E~Dm~","paragraphs":["Abelson, R.
