These properties, which form one of the cornerstones of his current linguistic theory, are embodied in a set of constraints on language, a set of restrictions on the operation of rules of grammar.","This paper will outline two arguments presented at length in [Marcus 77] demonstrating that important sub-cases of two of these constraints, the Subjacency Principle and the Specified Subject Constraint, fall out naturally from the structure \"of a grammar interpreter called PARSIFAL, whose structure is in turn based upon the hypothesis that a natural language parser needn't simulate a nondeterministic machine. This \"Determinism Hypothesis\" claims that natural language can be parsed by a computationally simple mechanism that uses neither backtracking nor pseudoparallelism, and in which all grammatical structure created by the parser is \"indelible\" in that it must all be output as part of the structural analysis of the parser's input. Once built, no grammatical structure can be discarded or altered in the course of the parsing process.","In particular, this paper will show that the structure of the grammar interpreter constrains its operation in such a way that, by and large, grammar rules cannot parse sentences which violate either .the Specified Subject Constraint or the Subjacency. Principle. The component of the grammar interpreter upon which this result principally depends is motivated by the Determinism Hypothesis; this result thus provides indirect evidence for the hypothesis. This result also depends upon the use within a compLitational framework of the closely related notions of annotated surface structure and trace theory, which also derive from Chomsky's recent work.","(It should be noted that these constraints are far from universally accepted. They are currently the source of much controversy; for various critiques of Chomsky's position see [Postal 74; Bresnan 76]. However, what is presented below does not argue for these constraints, per se, but rather provides a different sort of explanation, based on a processing model, of why the sorts of sentences which these constraints forbid are bad. While the exact formulation of these constraints is controversial, the fact that some set of constraints is needed to account for this range of data is generally agreed upon by most generative (jrammarians. The account which I will present below is crucially linked to Chomsky's, however, in that trace theory is at the heart of this account.)","Because of space limitations, this paper deals only with those grammatical processes characterized by the competence rule \"MOVE NP\"; the constraints imposed by the grammar interl)reter upon those processes characterized by the rule \"MOVE WH-phrase\" are discussed at length in [Marcus 77] where I show that the behavior characterized by Ross's Complex NP Constraint [Ross 67] itself follows directly from the structure of the grammar interpreter for rather different reasons than the behavior considered in this section. Also because of space limitations, I will not attempt to show that the two constraints I will deal with here necessarily follow from the grammar interpreter, but rather only .that they naturally follow from the interpreter, in particular from a simple, natural formulation of a rule for passivization which itself depends heavily upon the structure of the interpreter. Again, necessity is argued for in detail in [Marcus 77].","This pal)er will first outline the structure of the grammar interpreter, then present the PASSIVE rule, and tho.n finally show how Chomsky% constraints \"fall out\" of the formulation of PASSIVE.","Before proceeding with the body of this paper, two other important properties of the parser should be mentioned which will not be discussed here. Both are discussed at lengtll in [Marcus 77]; the first is sketched as well in [Marcus 781:","1) Simple rules of grammar can by written for this interpreter which elegantly capture the significant generalizations behind not only passivization, but also such constructions as yes/no questions, imperatives, and sentences with existential there. These rules are reminiscent of the sorts of rules proposed within the framework of the theory of generative grammar, despite the fact that the rules presented here must recover underlying structure given only the terminal string of the surface form of the sentence.","2)The grammar interpreter provides a simple e×planation for the difficulty caused by \"garden path\" sentences, such as \"The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi.\" Rules can be written for this interpreter to"]},{"title":"236","paragraphs":["resolve local structural ambiguities which might seem to require nondeterministic parsing; the power of such rules, however, depends upon a parameter of the mechanism. Most structural ambiguities can be resolved, given an appropriate setting of this parameter, but those which typically cause garden paths cannot.","The Structure of PARSIFAL","PARSIFAL maintains two major data structures: a pushdown stack of incomplete donstituents called the active node stack, and a small three-place constituent buffer which contains constituents which are complete, but whose higher level grammatical function is as yet uncertain.","Figure 1 below shows a snapshot of the parser's data structures taken while parsing the sentence \"John should have scheduled -the meeting.\". Note that the active node stack in shown growing downward, so that the structure of the stack reflects the structure of the emerging parse tree. At the bottom of the stack is an auxiliary node labelled with the features modal, past, etc., which has as a daughter the modal \"should\". Above the bottom of the stack is an S node with an NP as a daughter, dominating the word \"John\". There are two words in tim buffer, the verb \"have\" in the first buffer cell and the word \"scheduled\" in the second. The two words \"the meeting\" have not yet come to the attention of the parser. (The structures of form \"(PARSE-AUX CPOOL)\" and the like will be explained below.) The Active Node Stack $1 (S DECL MAJOR S) / (PARSE-AUX CPOOL)","NP : (John) AUX1 (MODAL PAST VSPL AUX) / (BUILD-AUX)","MODAL : (should) 1 ; 2: The Buffer WORD8 (~HAVE VERB TNSLESS AUXVERB PRES","V-eS) : (have) WORD4 (\"SCHEDULE COMP-OBJ VERB INF-OBJ","V-eS ED=EN EN PART PAST ED) : (scheduled) Yet unseen words: the meeting. Figure 1 - PARSIFAL's two major data structures.","The constituent bt,ffer is the heart of the grammar interpreter; it is the central feature that distinguishes this parser from all others. The words that make up the parser's input first come to its attention when they appear at the end of this buffer after morphological analysis. Triggered by the words at the beginning of the buffer, the parser may decide to create a new grammatical constituent, create a new node at the bottom of the active node stack, and then begin to attach the constituents in the buffer to it. After this new constituent is completed, the parser will then pop the f~ew constituent from the active node stack; if the grammatical role of this larger structure is as yet undetermined, the parser will insert it into the first cell of the buffer. The parser is free to examine the constituents in the buffer, to act upon them, and to otherwise use the buffer as a workspace. While the buffer allows the parser to examine some of the context surrounding a given constituent, it does not allow arbitrary Iook-allead. The length of the buffer is strictly limited; in the version of the parser presented here, the buffer has only three cells. (The buffer must be extended to five cells to allow the parser to build NPs in a nlanner which is transparent to the \"clause level\" grammar rules which will be presented in this paper. This extended parser still has a window of only three cells, but the effective start of the buffer can be changed through an \"attention ~hifting mechanism\" whenever the parser is building an NP. In effect, this extended parser has two \"logical\" buffers of length three, one for NPs and another for clauses, witll these two buffers implemented by allowing an overlap in one larger buffer. For details, see [Marcus 77].)","Note tllat each of the three cells in the buffer can hold a grammatical consHtuent of any type, .where a constituent is any tree that the parser has constructed under a single root node. The size of the structure underneath the node is immaterial; both \"that\" and \"that the big green cookie monster's toe got stubbed\" are perfectly good constituents once the parser has constructed a subordinate clause from the latter phrase,","The constituent buffer and the active node stack are acted upon by a grammar which is made up of pattern/action rules; this grammar can be viewed as an augmented form of Newell and Simon's production systems [Newell & Simon 72]. Each rule is made up of a pattern, which is matched against some subset of the constituents of the buffer and the accessible nodes in the active node stack (about which more will be said below), and an action, a sequence of operations which acts on these constituents. Each rule is assigned a numerical priority, which the grammar interpreter uses to arbitrate simultaneous matches.","The grammar as a whole is structured into rule packets, clumps of grammar rules which can be activated and deac(ivated as a group; the grammar interpreter only attempts to match rules in packets that have been activated by the grammar. Any grammar rule can activate a packet by associating that packet with the constituent at the bottom of the active node stack. As long as that node is at the bottom of the stack, the packets associated with it are active; when that node is pushed into the stack, the packets remain associated with it, but become active again only when that node reaches the bottom of the stack. For example, in figure 1 above, the packet BUILD-AUX is associated with the bottom of the stack, and is thus active, while the packet PARSE-AUX is associated with the S node above the auxiliary.","The grammar rules themselves are written in a language called PIDGIN, an English-like formal language that is translated into LISP by a simple grammar translator based on the notion of top-down operator precedence [Pratt 73]. This use of pseudo-English is similar to tile use of pseudo-English in the grammar for Sager's STRING parser [Sager 73.]. Figure 2 below gives a schematic overview of the organization of the grammar, and exhibits some of the rules that make up the packet PARSE-AUX. A few comments on the grammar notation itself are"]},{"title":"237","paragraphs":["in order. The general form of each grammar rule is:","{Rule (name) priority: <priority) in (packet) <pattern) --> <action)} Each pattern is of tl~e form : [(description of 1st buffer constituent)] [<2nd)] [<3rd>] The symbol \"=\", used only in pattern descriptions, is to be read as \"has the feature(s)\". Features of the form \"*<word>\" mean \"has time root <word)\", e.g. \"*have\" means \"has the root \"have\"\". The tokens \"1st\", \"2nd\", \"3rd\" and \"C\" (or \"c\") refer to the constituents in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd buffer positions and the current active node (i.e. the bottom of the stack), respectively.

Figure 2","Time parser (i.e. time grammar interpreter interpreting some grammar) operates by attaching constituents which are in the buffer to the constituent at the bottom of the stack; functionally, a constituent is in the stack when the parser is attempting to find its daughters, and in the buffer when the parser is attempting to find its mother. Once a constituent in the buffer has been attached, the grammar interpreter will automatically remove it from the buffer, filling in the'gap by shifting to the left the constituents formerly to its right. When the parser has completed the constituent at the bottom of the stack, it pops that constituent from the active node stack; the constituent either remains attached to its parent, if it was attached to some larger constituent When it was created, or else it falls into the first cell of the constituent buffer, shifting time buffer to time riglmt to create a gap (and causing aim error if the buffer was already full). If the constituents in the buffer provide sufficient evidence that a constituent of a given type should be initiated, a new node of that type can be created and pushed onto time stack; this new node can also be attached to the node at the bottom of the stack before the stack is pushed, if time grammatical function of the new constituent is clear when it is created.","This structure is motivated by several prOperties which, as is argued in [Marcus 77], any \"nonnondeterministic\" grammar interpreter must embody. These principles, and their embodiment in PARSIFAL, are as follows:","1 ) A deterministic parser must be at least partially data driven. A grammar for PARSIFAL is made up of pattern/actiOn rules which are triggered when constituents which fulfill specific descriptions appear in the buffer."]},{"title":"2)","paragraphs":["A deterministic parser must be able to reflect expectations that follow from the partial structures built up during the parsing process. Packets of rules can be activated and deactivated by grammar rules to reflect the properties of the constituents in the active node stack."]},{"title":"3)","paragraphs":["A deterministic parser must have some sort of constrained look-ahead facility. PARSIFAL's buffer provides this constrained look-ahead. Because the buffer can hold several constituents, a grammar rule can examine the context that follows the first constituent in the buffer before deciding what grammatical role it fills in a higher level structure. The key idea is that the size of the buffer can be sharply constrained if each location in the buffer can hold a single complete constituent, regardless of that constituent's size. It must be stressed that this look-ahead ability must be constrained in some manner, as it is here by limiting the length of the buffer~ otherwise the \"determinism\" claim is VACUOUS.","The General Gran~matical Framework - Traces","The form of the structures that time current grammar builds is based on the notion of Annotated Surface Structure. This term has been used in two different senses by Winograd I-Winograd 71] and CImomsky [Cllomsky 7,3]; the usage of time term here can be thought of as a synthesis of the two concepts. Following Winograd, tlmis term will be used to refer to a notion of surface structure annotated by the addition of a set of features to each node in a parse tree. Following Chomsky, time term will be used to refer to a notion of surface structure annotated by the addition of aim element called trace to indicate the \"underlying position\" of \"shifted\" NPs.","In current linguistic theory, a trace is essentially a \"phonologically null\" NP in the surface structure representation of a sentence that has 11o daughters but is \"bound\" to the NP that filled that position at some level of underlying structure. In a sense, a trace can be viewed as a \"dummy\" NP that serves as a placeholder for the NP that earlier filled that position; in the same sense, the trace's 238 binding can be viewed as simply a pointer to that NP. It should be stressed at the outset, however, that a trace is indistinguishable from a normal NP in terms of normal grammatical processes; a trace"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["an NP, even though it is an NP that dominates no lexical material.","There are several reasons for choosing a properly annotated surface structure as a primary output representation for syntactic analysis. While a deeper analysis is needed to recover the predicate/argument structure of a sentence (either in terms of Fillmore case relations [Fillmore 68] or Gruber/Jackendoff \"thematic relations\" [Gruber 65; Jackendoff 72]), phenomena such as focus, theme, pronominal reference, scope of quantification, and the like can be recovered only from the surface structure of a sentence. By means of proper annotation, it is possible to encode in the surface structure the \"deep\" syntactic i.formation necessary to recover underlying predicate/argument relations, and tht,s to encode in the same formalism both deep syntactic relations and the surface order needed for pronominal reference and the other phenomena listed above.","Some examples of the use of trace are given in Figure 3 immediately below.

The position of the trace indicates that ,3.1a has an underlying structure analoqous to the overt surface structure of 3.1c.","Another use of trace is to indicate the underlying position of the surface subject of a passivized clause. For example, 8.2a will be parsed into a structure that includes a trace as shown as 8.2b; this trace indicates that the suhject of the passive has the underlying position shown in 3.2e.

In essence, then, the Specified Subject Constraint constrains the rule \"MOVE NP\" in such a way that only the subject of a clause can be moved out of that clause into a position in a higher S. Thus, if a trace in an annotated surface structure is bound to an NP Dominated by a higher S, that trace must fill the subject position of the lower clause.","In the remainder of this section I will show that the grammar interpreter constrains grammatical processes in such a way that annotated surface structures constructed by thp. grammar interpreter will have this same property, given the formulation of the PASSIVE rule presented above. In torms of the parsing process, this means that if a trace is \"lowered\" from one clause to another as a result of a \"MOVE NP\"-type operation during the parsing process, then it will be attached as the subject of the second clause. To be more precise, if a trace is attached so that it is Dominated by some S node $1', and the trace is bound to an NP Dominated by some other S node $2, then that trace will necessarily be attached so that it fills the subject position of $1.

The original point of the example, of course, was that the rather simple PASSIVE rule handles this case without the need for some mechanism to explicitly lower the NP. The PASSIVE rule captures this generalization by 242 dropping the trace it creates into the buffer (after appropriately binding the trace), thus allowing other rules written to handle normal NPs (e.g. OBJECTS and INF-S-START1) to correctly place the trace.","This statement of PASSIVE does more, however, than simply capture a generalization about a specific construction.

This means that the ordering of the operation.~ is crucially: 1) create a trace and drop it into tile buffer, 2) create a subordinate S node, 3) attach the trace to the newly created S node. Tile key point is that at tile time that the subordinate clause node is created and becomes tile current active node, tile trace must be sitting in the buffer, filling one of the three buffer positions.

If Y dominates X, and no other nodes intervene (i.e. X is a daughter of Y), then Y immediately (or directly) dominates X. [Akmajian & Heny 7,5]. One non-standard definition will prove useful: I will say that if Y dominates X, and Y is a cyclic node, i.e. an S or NP node, and there is no other cyclic node Z such that Y dominates Z and Z dominates 'X (i.e. there is no intervening cyclic node Z between Y and X) then Y Dominates X.","The principle of Subjacency, informally stated, says that no rule can involve constituents that are separated by more than one Cyclic node. Let us say that a node X is subjacent to a node Y if there is at most one cyclic node, i.e. at most one NP or S node, between the cyclic node that Dominates Y and the node X. Given this definition, the Subjacency principle says that no rule can involve constituents that are not subjacent.","The Sul)jacency principle implies that movement rules are constrained so that they can move a constituent only into positions that the constituent was subjacent to, i.e. only within the clause (or NP) in which it originates, or into the clause (or NP) that Dominates that clause (...).

Thus, to use one of Chomsky's examples, tile sentence given in figure 18a, with a deep structure analogous to 18b, must be derived as follows (assuming that '*is certain\", like \"seems\", has no subject in underlying structure): The deep structure must first undergo a movement operation that results in a structure analogous to 18c, and then another movement operation that results in 18(I, each of these movements leaving a trace as shown. That 18c is in fact an intermediate structure is supported by the existence of sentences such as 18e, which purportedly result when the V in the matrix S is replaced by the lexical item \"it\", and the embedded S is tensed rather than infinitival. The structure given in 18f is ruled out as a possible annotated surface structure, because the single trace could only be left if the NP \"John\" was moved in one fell swoop from its underlying position to its position in surface structure, which would violate Subjacency.

Specifically, I will show that there are only limited cases in which a trace generated by a \"MOVE-NP\" process can be \"lowered\" more than one clause, i.e. that a trace created and bound while any given S is current must almost always be attached either to that S or to an S which is Dominated by that S.","Let us begin by examining what it would mean to lower a trace more than one clause. Given that a trace can only be \"lowered\" by dropping it into the buffer and then creating a suhordinate S node, as discussed above, lowering a trace more than one clause necessarily implies the following sequence of events, depicted in figure 19 below: First, a trace NP1 must (a) be created with some S node, $1, as the current S, (b) bound to some NP Dominated by that S and then (c) dropped into the buffer. By rlefinition, it will be inserted into the first cell in the buffer. (This is shown in figure lga)Then a second S, $2, must be created, stq~planting $1 as the ct=rrent S, and then yet a third S, $3, must he created, becoming the current S. During all these steps, the trace NP1 remains sitting in the buffer. Finally, NP1 is attached ¢,nder $3 (fig. 19b). By the Specified Subject Constraint, NP1 must then attach to $3 as its subject. The Active Node Stack C: $1 ... / ... 1 st: The Buffer NP1 (NP TRACE) : bound to NP Dominated by $1","(a) - NP1 is dropped into the buffer while $1 is the current S.

Figl,re lg - Lowering a trace more than 1 clause","But this sequence of events is highly unlikely. The essence of the argument is this:","Nothing in tile buffer can change between tile time that $2 is created and $3 is created if NP1 remains in the buffer. NP1, like any other node that is dropped from the active node stack into the buffer, is inserted into the first buffer position. But then, by the L-to-R Constraint, nothing to the right of NP1 can be attached to a higher level constituent until NP1 is attached. (One can show that it is most unlikely that any constituents will enter to the left of NP1 after it is dropped into tile buffer, but I will suppress this detail here; tile full argument is included in [Marcus 77].) 244","But if the contents of the buffer do not change between the creation of $2 and $3, then what can possibly motivate the creation of both $2 and $3? The contents of the buffer mr,st necessarily provide clear evidence that botl] of these clauses are present, since, by the Determinism Hypothesis, the parser must be correct if it initiates a constittient. Thus, the same three constituents in tim buffer must provide convincing evidence not only for the creation of $2 hut also for $3. Furthermore, if NP1 is to become tile subject of $3, and if $2 Dominates $3, then it woL,Id seem that tile constituents that follow NP1 in the buffer nit=st also be constituents of $3, since $3 must be completed before it is dropped from the active node stack and constituents can then be attached to $2. But then $2 must be created entirely on the basis of evidence provided by the constituents of another clatise (unless Sa has less than three constituents). Thus, it would seem that the contents of the buffer cannot provide evidence for the presence of both clauses unless tile presence of $3, by itself, is enough to provide confirming evidence for the presence of $2. Tiffs would be the case only if there were, say, a clausal construction that could only appear (perhaps in a particular environment) as tile initial constituent of a higher clause. In tiffs case, if there are such constructions, a violation of Subjacency should be possible.","With the one exception just mentioned, there is no motivation for creating two clauses in such a situation, and tllus the initiation of only one such clause can be motivated. But if only one clause is initiated before NP1 is attached, then NP1 must he attached to this clause, and this clause is necessarily subjacentto the clause which Dominates the NP to which it is bound. Thus, the grammar interpreter will behave as if it enforces the Subjacency Constraint.","As a concluding point, it is worthy of note that willie the grammar interpreter appears to behave exactly as if it were consD:ained by the Subjacency principle, it is in fact constrained by a version of the Clausemate Constraint! (The Clausemate Constraint, long tacitly assumed by linguists but first explicitly stated, I believe, by Postal [Postal 64], states that a transformation can only involve constituents that are Dominated by the same cyclic node. This constraint is at the heart of Postal's attack on the constraints that are discussed above and his argument for a \"raising\" analysis.) The grammar interpreter, as was stated above, limits grammar rules from examining any node in the active node stack higher than tile current cyclic node, which is to say that it can only examine clausemates. The trick is that a trace is created and bound while it is a \"clausemate\" of the NP to which it is bound in that the current cyclic node at that time is the node to which that NP is attached. The trace is then dropped into the buffer and another S node is created, thereby destroying the clausemate relationship. The trace is then attached to this new 5 node. Thus, in a sense, the trace is lowered from one clause to another. The crucial point is that while this lowering goes on as a result of the operation of tile grammar interpreter, it is only implicitly lowered in that 1) the trace was never attached to the higher S and 2) it is not dropped into tile buffer because of any realization that it must be \"lowered\"; in fact it may end up attached as a clausemate of the NP to which it is bound - as the passive examples pre~ented earlier make clear. Tl~e trace is simply dropped into the buffer because its grammatical function is not clear, and the creation of tile second S follows from other ifldependently motivated grammatical processes. From the point of view of this processing theory, we can have our cake and eat it too; to the extent that it makes sense to map results from the realm of processing into the realm of competence, in a sense both the clausemate/\"raising\" and the Subjacency positions are correct. Evidence for the Determinism Hypothesis","In closing, I would like to show that the properties of the grammar interpreter crucial to capturing the behavior of Chomsky's constraints were originally motivated'by the Determinism Hypothesis, and thus, to some extent, the Determinism Hypotlmsis explains Chomsky's constraints.","Tile strongest form of such an argument, of course, woukl he to show that (a) either (i) the grammar interpreter accounts for all of Chomsky's constraints in a manner which is conclusively ¢miversal or (ii) the constraints that it will not account for are wrong and that (b) the properties of the grammar interpreter which were crucial for this proof were forced by the Determinism Hypothesis. If such an argument cotdd be made, it would show that tile Determinism Hypothesis provides a natural processing account of the linguistic data characterized by Chomsky's constraints, giving strong confirmation to the Determinism Hypothesis.","I have shown none Of the above, and thus' my claims must be proportionately more modest. I have argued only that important sub-cases of Chomsky's Constraints follow from the grammar interpreter, and while I can show that the Determinism Hypothesis strongly motivates the mechanisms from which these arguments follow, I cannot show necessity. The extent to which this argument provides evidence for tile Determinism Hypothesis must thus be left to the reader; no objective measure exists for such matters.","The ability to drop a trace into the buffer is at the heart of the arguments presented here for Subjacency and the 55C as consequences of the functioning of the grammar interpreter; this is the central operation upon which the above arguments are based. But the buffer itself, and the fact that a constituent can be dropped into the buffer if its grammatical function is uncertain, are directly motivated by the Determinism Hypothesis. Given tiffs, it is fair to claim that if Chomsky's constraints follow from the operation of the grammar interpreter, then they are strongly linked to the Determinism Hypothesis. If Chomsky's constraints are In fact true, then the arguments presented in this paper provide solid evidence in support of the Determinism Hypothesis.","Acknowledgments","This paper summarizes one result presented in my Ph.D. thesis; I would like to express my gratitude to the many people who Contributed to the technical content of tllat work: Jon Alien, my thesis advisor, to whom I owe a special debt of tllanks, Ira Goldstein, Seymour Papert, Bill 245 Martin, Bob Moore, Chuck Rieger, Mike Genesereth, Gerry Sussman, Mike Brady, Craig Thiersch, Beth Levin, Candy Bullwinkle, Kl,rt VanLehn, Dave McDonald, and Chuck Rich.","This paper describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
