Since the relation between referring expressions and speaker's goals is what needs explaining, it is natural to consider referring as planned action [1,4,5]. This, in turn, requires showing how the use of referring expressions is systematically related to changes in the hearer's mental state. For that purpose, we need to know the speaker's goals concerning the hearer's mental state, and therefore, a pragmatic theory of referring must first of all specify and describe the goals that typically motivate the use of referring expressions. It is with such goals that this paper is concerned.","The view that the referring act is a planned effort to achieve certain goals through linguistic means simply follows from the fact that referring is a"]},{"title":"speech act:","paragraphs":["all speech acts are attempts to achieve certain goals through linguistic means.

In performing one and the same speech act, a speaker may have many distinct goals.

But since a referring act lacks propositional content, it is not clear what its conditions of satisfaction are 2 Syntax and Semantics. In (direct) illocutionary acts, we have a fairly precise correlation between syntax and semantics on the one hand, and illocutionary point on the other. Assertions and commands, for example, have their syntactic counterparts in indicative and imperative sentences, and illocutionary points are represented by performative verbs. But while a serious utterance of an imperative sentence is almost always taken as a directive type of speech act, the serious utterance of a noun phrase - even a definite noun phrase - is not necessarily an act of referring. Similarly, one can promise, say, to pay one's debt by stating: \"I hereby promise to pay my debt,\" but merely uttering \"I hereby refer to a friend of mine\" is hardly satisfactory. Thus, the semantic and syntactic clues that enable the hearer to recognize an illocutionary act do not help much as far as referring is concerned. Compositionality. The major difference between propositional acts and illocutionary ones is that the latter are constructed out of the former and not vice versa. Referring and predicating are related to illocutionary acts as the form and meaning of NP's and VP's are related to the form and meaning of a full sentence. In pragmatics, as in syntax and semantics, it must be shown how the whole is a function of its parts.

The literal goal of a speech act and its conditions of satisfaction are usually distinct: If I tell you that I want the door closed and you understand me, the literal goal of my request is achieved. But it is still up to you whether or not to satisfy my request. 165 presuppositions that are associated with the propositional act of referring: for example, that it is mutually believed that the use of the definite article in this case signals an anaphoric link with a referring expression mentioned earlier.","To sum up, we have four problems with respect to referring acts which seem harder to resolve than their corresponding problems in a theory of illocutionary acts: 1. What is the literal goal of a referring act? 2. What are its conditions of satisfaction?","3. When is an NP a referring expression, and what role does its meaning play in the referring act? 4. How does referring contribute to the success of illocutionary acts? In this paper I concentrate on the first two questions.

The literal goals of all speech acts are to affect the bearer's propositional attitudes in a particular way. Intuitively, the point of referring is to let the hearer know what is being talked about. The literal goal of the referring act must be, therefore, to make the hearer believe that it is mutually believed by all participants that a noun phrase is being used as a referring expression, and that ~identification\" of a particular object is required. Rules for identification. What counts as \"proper identification\" changes from discourse to discourse. For example, in \"Replace this 300-ohm-resistor,\" the hearer is asked to \"identify\" the referent in the sense of locating it in his visual field. But in \"Tell me what other plays were written by the author of Hamlet,\" visual identification is clearly not required, although the hearer is still expected to identify the author of Hamlet in another way. If the point of the referring act is the establishment of mutual agreement as to which object is being talked about, then a necessary condition for successful referring is that the hearer understand the ground rules for establishing such mutual agreement. These ground rules, which change from discourse to discourse, should be arrived at by the analysis of what we call the pragmatic notion of referent identification. Identification goals. Understanding the ground rules for referent identification is not the same as following these rules. While the literal goal of a referring act is that the hearer recognize the speaker's intentions that the hearer identify an object in a particular way, the condition of satisfaction of the referring act is that the hearer actually identify the referent 166 as required. Under typical circumstances, understanding the utterance \"Replace the 300ohm resistor\" entails understanding that visual identification of the resistor is required. Another question entirely is whether actual identification eventually takes place.

One can imagine a dynamic stack of active individuating sets representing the objects under discussion.","Do we really need individuating sets? The answer is yes, for two important reasons. First, individuating sets provide elegant solutions for several problems that are raised by the Referential/Attributive distinction [10,11,12]. Second, as we have seen, a major problem for a referring model is specifying the conditions under which a hearer can be said to have identified the intended referent.

But very few objects are endowed with standard names, and it can be easily shown that a rigid designator is neither sufficient nor necessary for successful referent identification [12]. Moreover, requiring agents to know standard names or rigid designators for individuals that they refer to makes some undesirably strong predictions about what a speaker must know in order to refer to something [2]. Using individuating sets we can solve these problems. 3For a more detailed discussion of individuating sets and their terms see [3,12]. 167 Identification constraints As noted earlier, \"identification\" should be interpreted pragmatically. Referent identification does not mean knowing who (or what) the referent is, but rather knowing who or what is being talked about. In general, the requirements for referent identification can be characterized in terms of constraints that the speaker places on the activated individuating set. I call these constraints identification constraints.","Let S be the activated individuating set. The following examples illustrate different identification constraints on S: Example 1 Take this chair to my office. In Example 1, the hearer should \"identify\" the chair in the sense of locating it in his visual field. We can express this requirement as a constraint on S that it contain a new perceptual term. Example 2 Do you remember the brown desk I used to have in my office? In Example 2, the identification constraint is that the S should contain an old perceptual term, i.e. \"identification\" consists of connecting a definite description with an image in memory. Example 3 A friend of mine has just won $10,000 in a sweepstakes, but the lucky bastard will probably gamble it all away. Identification constraint: that S activated by the description \"The lucky bastard\" be augmented to include a term that has already been introduced into the discourse. \"Identification\" here is simply making an anaphoric connection. Example 4 My sister has just got married. The lucky man met her only three weeks ago. Identification constraint: the S should contain the description \"the husband of the speaker's sister\". Note the difference between this case and Example 3: the description \"my sister's husband\" was never mentioned, and had to be deduced by the hearer. The deduction, of course, is a necessary condition for successful identification. Example 5 The man whose fingerprints these are, whoever he is, must be insane. Assume that the context of Example 5 is as follows: the speaker is investigating the horrible murder of Smith, and he has just found clear fingerprints on what he believes to be the murder weapon. The speaker, of course, wishes to assert that whoever murdered poor Smith in such a terrible way must be insane. Hence the identification constraint is that the S should contain the description \"Smith's murderer\". This example illustrates why we insist that identification as the goal of the referring act is a pragmatic, rather than an epistemological concept. Neither speaker, nor hearer in this case have any idea who murdered Smith, and thus, they cannot identify him in any epistemological sense of the term. But from a pragmatic point of view, there is a clear dichotomy: if the hearer makes the connection between \"The man whose fingerprints these are,\" and \"Smith's murderer,\" he has identified who the speaker is talking about. Otherwise, he has not. 168 Example 6 I met"]},{"title":"an old friend of mine","paragraphs":["yesterday. This is the case of the null set of identification constraints. S contains a single term, and this is sufficient for pragmatic identification.","These examples show that the requirements for referent identification can be very diverse indeed. They all can be represented, however, as constraints on relations among individuating sets. The referring act. Armed with the concepts of individuating sets and identification constraints, we can characterize the act of referring as an act of conveying an ordered pair: an individuating set (which becomes the active one), and a set of identification constraints. The literal goal of the referring act is that it is mutually known by all participants which individuating set is active, and what the identification constraints are.
