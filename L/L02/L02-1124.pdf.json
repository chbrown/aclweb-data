Recently speech has featured as user interface in electronic products, computer, telecommunication, etc. As practical uses of speech technologies such as speech recognition and synthesis increase, difficulties arise in academia and industry with speech corpora and assessment. Thus Speech Information Technology & Industry Promotion Center (SITEC) was founded in 2001 under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy to help solve the common difficulties in the field and to manage creation and distribution of speech resources in Korea. As the name indicates, the Center will work as the center for systematic national coordination of industries, schools, and associations. We will introduce the SITEC and present its current activities and future plans. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Speech is the most efficient and effective means of communication between humans. Research on speech has been done in linguistics, phonetics, phonology, physiology, etc. as well as in speech engineering. Since 1970’s technologies in computer, semi-conductor, and signal processing have progressed at a rapid speed, and much effort has been made to put the results into practical use. Recently speech has featured as a user interface in electronic products, computers, telecommunications, etc. We have experienced a significant growth in various speech technologies, and more and more products and services which use the technologies are being developed for everyday life. As practical uses of speech information technologies such as speech recognition and synthesis increase, difficulties arise in academic and industrial areas with respect to speech information technology, as with speech corpora for research and development and assessment for recognition and synthesis systems. Thus, Speech Information Technology & Industry Promotion Center (SITEC) was founded as a consortium in May 30, 2001, and Wonkwang University was selected as the host for the Center. We will introduce the SITEC and present its current activities and future plans."]},{"title":"2. Introduction to SITEC","paragraphs":["Speech information technologies such as speech recognition, speech synthesis and speaker recognition/ verification stand out as one of the 10 most promising technologies in the 21st","century. The world market for the products which use these technologies are expanding at a rapid speed. In Korea there are 20 or odd companies which provide these technologies and more than 100 companies which use them to develop their products. A further rapid growth is expected in the field of developing applications since speech information technologies can be applied to various industrial fields.","However, there are three issues for speech information technology industry in Korea: (1) industrial environments, (2) technology development, and (3) marketing. Current domestic industrial environments are characterized by small sizes of the companies, lack of cooperation among the companies, institutions, academia, and insufficient governmental policies. Current states of essential and primitive technology, number of specialized persons, environments for exchange of technology and industrial information, databases for common use, objective assessment of speech information technologies and evaluation of application performance, etc. are not sufficient for technology development. SITEC was founded in this context to foster speech information technology industry in Korea."]},{"title":"2.1.

Creation of speech corpora ","paragraphs":["Clean speech corpus A speech corpus is being created for research for technological applications, based on 4,178 phonetically rich words containing various phonetic environments and syllable units. Data collection has been completed by regional affiliated sites for 500 speakers who are sampled according to sex, age, and region. The data is being labelled according to the conventions for labeling. Corpus for children’s speech A speech corpus is being created for pre-school and elementary school children. The word list consists of 1,233 words including 41 digits and command words, 340 four-digit numbers, 452 phonetically balanced words, 400 control command words. Each speaker reads 100 words. 500 children are currently being recorded. Corpus for read aloud sentences A corpus for read aloud sentences collected through PC is being created for applications such as dictation. The reading list consists of 20,833 sentences which are made up of 10,000 words with high frequency extracted from a text corpus containing 43 million words, and it is structured for OOV (out of vocabulary) test, etc. as follows: *5K set: the set of sentences composed of high frequency 5,000 words *8K set: the set of sentences which are composed of high frequency 8,000 phonological words, excluding the sentences in the 5K set from 20,833 sentences *10K set: the rest of the sentences excluding the sentences in the 5K and 8K sets from 20,833 sentences Currently 400 speakers are being recorded. Each speaker reads 100 sentences.  Corpus for prosody research and synthesis A text was constructed by the following procedure: 10 million phonological phrases were extracted from a text corpus of 43 million phonological phrases (Choi 2001), considering genre (domain), and then 4,360 phonetically rich sentences were extracted by the greedy algorism.","The 4360 sentences were each recorded by one male professional announcer and one female professional announcer, and phonological and K-ToBI prosodic labeling is currently being done. Prototype for noise and speech database in the","car noise environments Recently speech recognition in car noise environments has been recognized. Thus demands have increased for corpora of speech in car noise environments. Data in various driving environments is being collected through 8 channels as a prototype to develop methods and procedures to create a corpus of speech in car noise environments. Encouraging to share existing corpora Some proprietors have agreed to share their existing corpora. Thus those corpora are being assessed and supplemented. At present a corpus of telephone speech of 2,000 speakers, a corpus of 452 phonetically balanced words by 70 speakers for research, and a corpus of numbers by 500 speakers are being prepared for sharing."]},{"title":"3.3.
