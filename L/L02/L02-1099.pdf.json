Using the Hellenic National Corpus (HNC) (Hatzigeorgiu et al., 2000) as a reference point we estimated a number of critical statistical measures regarding feature counting in different text sizes. The results indicate that frequent linguistic features behave differently from the medium frequency and the rare ones and the text size increase do not affect them uniformly."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Most corpora, regarding the text size issue, use as a reference point the choices that were made in the design of the Brown corpus (Kucera & Frances, 1967). However it has been pointed out that significant choices in the Brown corpus design were based on the technological and socio-scientific circumstances of this era (Eagles, 1996: 3). Especially the issue of the text size (fixed in 2000+ words per text in Brown corpus) the last decade has begun to be questioned and a number of different text sizes has been adopted in recent corpora.","Although there are few empirical investigations regarding the issue of optimal sample size there is a general agreement that the occurrence of linguistic features is highly dependent from their frequency, as it is counted in a general language corpus, and the text size that is used to locate them. Previous studies (de Haan, 1992) have shown that frequent linguistic features do not correlate significantly with the text size and present stability and uniformity of occurrence across different text sizes. On the other hand, low frequency features exhibit considerable variation and need text sizes of considerable amount in order to stabilize their occurrence. Biber & Finegan (1991) examining data in English language analysed the distribution of a number of linguistic features across text sizes of 1000 words extracted from larger texts from the LOB and London - Lund corpora. They found that counts of frequent features are relative stable across 1000 words sample."]},{"title":"2. Methodology 2.1. Selection of the linguistic features","paragraphs":["In order to define the optimum text size in a corpus of Modern Greek we used the HNC as a starting point. In the HNC there are texts of different sizes regarding mainly from the medium of the text. In order to maintain uniformity of medium and at the same time a possibility to use texts that vary significantly in size we used the newspaper portion of the corpus.","The effect of the text size to the corpus design was investigated adopting a user-oriented view. The search of specific linguistic units becomes the main activity of most corpora users. The main virtue of every corpus that is used in this way is the ability to respond equally well to queries of specific features that are rare with those that are frequent. Considering this as the main criterion for validating the results of our study, we tried to test the effect of different text sizes in the presence of each linguistic feature taking into consideration its overall frequency in the general language.","In order to have a representative sample of linguistic features, which would play the role of search words in the corpus, we selected 36 linguistic units, which were further subdivided according their linguistic function (phonological, morphological, and lexical). For each feature, we included its absolute frequency of occurrence in the general Modern Greek language corpus (HNC). In order to homogenize the frequency scale we transformed the raw frequency data of each feature into a discrete variable that defined the frequency of a linguistic feature in a scale from 1 to 9 (1 was the most frequent feature while 9 was the most rare).","The selection of the lexical features was based on a frequency word list of the whole HNC. This list was divided in nine frequency areas. From each area we randomly extracted two words of different lexical category (part of speech). Following the same random procedure we extracted nine phonological and morphological features. The features selection is based on the following assumptions:","a) Uniform distribution: In order to maintain a uniform distribution of the selected features we ensure that all the features of the same frequency area were closely matched regarding their absolute frequency of occurrence in the HNC.","b) Non-correlation with the topic and genre of the text: Before selecting a feature we examined the correlation matrixes constructed between the feature and the topic or genre of the texts correspondingly","The linguistic features that correspond to the above criteria are displayed in the table 1: Table 1: Frequency classification of the selected linguistic features"]},{"title":"2.2. Construction of the test corpus","paragraphs":["In order to study the effects of text size we constructed sample frames of different text sizes. We preserved a general categorization scheme, which categorizes texts in categories that were different approximately 500 words from each other (6 size categories in total).","The distribution of the texts based on this categorization is shown in table 2:","Table2: Text distribution among text-size frames","The total corpus consists of 651.000 words in 485 texts that cover a wide spectrum of text genres and text topics","The above test corpus was used in order to investigate the following research questions:","a) How many texts of the total corpus do not contain the linguistic feature that we are looking for and how this number correlate with the text size and the frequency of the feature?","b) How two basic statistic measures of distribution homogeneity (the standard deviation and the standard error of the mean) correlate to the text size that is used and the frequency of the feature that is searched?","The investigation of the above research questions does not provide direct answers or rules of thumb in the practice of corpus design since the concept of optimum text size cannot be defined without reference to a specific design framework. However, we can define some basic quantitative trends and exploit them in the text sampling procedure. These trends can help us especially in the newspaper texts which are characterized from wide text size variation. In that case we can locate the intercept between two opposite requirements in text collection:","a) Large texts which are rarer in newspapers, but embed a significant amount of different linguistic features","b) Small texts which are more frequent in newspapers but do not contain rare linguistic features."]},{"title":"3. Results 3.1. Percentage of non-appearance of the selected linguistics features (PNA)","paragraphs":["The selected linguistic features were searched in the test corpus and their frequency of occurrence was recorded for each text file. For each one we calculated the percentage of non-appearance inside each text-size frame (as percentage of text files that do not exhibit a certain linguistic feature in relation to the number of total text files that exist in a specific text-size frame). This measure gave us an indication of the extent of the feature’s presence in the test corpus.","Investigating the percentage of non-appearance (PNA) of the selected features in relation to their overall frequency we conclude as was expected, that there is a perfect correlation between them. Enhancing our analysis we added the variable of the text size and we investigated the PNA of the features in a three-way table which combines the three main variables of our analysis: PNA of features in relation to their overall frequency and their text size frame in which they were","Frequency Area","Word Frequency of occurrence in HNC","Phoneme Frequency of occurrence in","HNC","Morpheme Frequency of occurrence in","HNC tou 14684 1 na 13787 the 13487 -ous 11885 gia 7757 2 einai 7371 sm 7069 -is 6672 tis 3413 3 ena 2537 kl 3288 -os 4945 itan 1856 4 mou 1839 sth 1849 -oume 2861 prepei 1054 5 xronia 906 xth 904 -ete 1071 iparxoun 472 6 politiki 433 lt 466 -eos 421 kivernisi 224 7 apotelei 213 nst 196 -menis 187 dosei 100 8 thalassa 100 dl 101 -simo 136 9 simiothei skepsi 50 50 sn 51 -ousas 50 Text-size frame (in words)","Number of texts","Size category 100-500 86 1 500-1000 95 2 1000-1500 154 3 1500-2000 67 4 2000-3000 58 5 3000< 25 6","searched.

The second most influential factor appears to be the size of the text files that we included in our corpus. A third factor that reaches statistical significance is the linguistic level of the searched feature. However, its influence is restricted compared to the effect of the previous mentioned variables. The following graph (Graph 1) displays the influence of the independent variables of the above regression analysis:","Graph 1: Interaction of text-size and frequency of a","linguistic feature in its PNA","By examining the above graph we can reach certain","conclusions regarding the interaction of the","independent variables of our study:","x The frequent linguistic features (from the 1st up to the 3rd","frequency area) exhibit stability in text sizes over 500 words. There is uniformity of appearance and their PNA does not correlate with the text size.","x The linguistic features that belong to the medium frequency area (from the 4th","to the 6th frequency area) exhibit strong correlation with the text size. The probability to search for them and not to find them in the corpus is","increasing linearly in relation to the size of the","text we are performing the search.","x The rare linguistic features (from the 7th","to the","9th","frequency area) exhibit similar behavior","with the frequent features. They do not","correlate with the text size, since they cannot","be found even if we are searching in very","large text (> 3000 words).","The correlational analysis shows that the linguistic features of the medium frequency area exhibit considerable sensitivity in the variation of the text size. In order to examine further the effect of the text size in the appearance of searched items in a corpus, we need to define which increase in the text size has the most decisive influence on the PNA of a linguistic feature.","We investigated the above issue by comparing the PNA of the features sequentially. We took the PNA of the first text size frame in all the features and we compared it with the PNA of the next immediate text size category. Each text size frame differs from each other approximately 500 words. Consequently, we estimate the effect of 500 words increase in the PNA of the selected linguistic features. This effect is displayed in the following graph (Graph 2):","Graph 2: Augmentation of the appearance of a","linguistic feature conditioned by the 500 word","increment in text size","The above graph shows that the greatest improvement in the representation of frequent and medium frequency features is met when the text size is incrementing from the 500 to 1000 words. On the other hand, the lowest improvement in the appearance of a feature happens when we increment the text size from 1000 -1500 to 1500 – 2000. This is an indication that text sizes from 1000 to 2000 words exhibit stability and uniformity in the quantitative representation of the linguistic features regardless their overall frequency of occurrence.","Rare features behave differently. The highest rates of improvement are exhibited in the transition from the text sizes of 1500 – 2000 to 2000 – 3000 words.

The influence of the text size in the standard deviation and standard error of the mean of the linguistic features","paragraphs":["A different way to estimate the influence of the text size in corpus design is to keep track of the evolution of two well known statistical measures of data dispersion:","a) Standard deviation (SD): A measure of the range of variation between the mean occurrences of a linguistic feature.","b) Standard error of the mean (SEM): A measure of how much the value of the mean occurrence of a linguistic feature may vary from sample to sample taken from the same distribution.","Both measures were calculated for each linguistic feature in each text size frame separately.
