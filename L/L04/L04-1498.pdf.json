In particular, this collaboration is focusing on the complex problem of meeting the language technology needs of societies with multi\\ple dominant and indigenous languages, as in the United States and Morocco, by, among other things, developing language resources for the spoken languages (Berber, Moroc\\can Arabic and Native American languages) in the two countries. We present the goal of the project, the activities undertaken so far and\\ the road ahead in this collaboration."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["By its very nature, Human Language Technology (HLT) is an interdisciplinary1","enterprise involving, at a minimum, the fields of computer science, linguistics, psychology and (special) education, hence the necessity of collaboration between teams comprised of individuals with different specialties. When taking into consideration the actual domain of information under consideration (e.g., medicine, law, chemistry, physics) additional specialization may be required. Consider the case of building an effective system for machine translation of text between languages that maximizes reader comprehension. We know that comprehension of information under ideal conditions (two native speakers of the same language, a relaxed setting) rarely, if ever, results in one to one mapping between the speaker s intent and the listener s understanding (Harris & Monaco, 1978). Two variables that affect comprehension of written information are text difficulty and skill of the reader (Wolfe, Schreiner, Rehder, Laham, Foltz, Kintsch, & Landauer, 1998). It is not surprising that, for   1 We use the term multidisciplinary to describe the fact that the field of Human Language Technology covers many disciplines; we use the term interdisciplinary to describe the activity of individuals from diverse disciplinary backgrounds working together to identify and resolve common problems. information that is translated by a computer (Machine Translation or MT) between languages or between sensory modalities, rates of comprehension drops precipitously due to characteristics of the author, accuracy of the computer program which does the translation, and, finally, characteristics of the reader (Murphy, 2000). The factors involved in end-user comprehension of machine translated text are amenable to interdisciplinary analysis of the translation scheme, itself, plus an analysis of the host of human information-processing and text-representation variables ultimately involved in human comprehension. It follows, then, that work on Human Language Technology applications, such as MT, prompts the need for the involvement of researchers with complimentary skills (computer science, linguistics, psychology, etc.). It is in this context that a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional team from the Great Plains Network2","together with a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional Moroccan   2 Initially funded by the National Science Foundation to provide advanced networking services to member institutions in the seven US states of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota, the mission of the Great Plains Network (http://www.greatplains.net, http://research.greatplains.net) includes the establishment of large-scale joint projects, which are of interest to significant portions of the higher education membership in the region. 377 team have been intensively coordinating the establishment of a collaborative, interdisciplinary research and education agenda in HLT to work on HLT applications involving Arabic (standard and Moroccan), Berber, English and Native American languages and to initiate a joint Masters degree in HLT."]},{"title":"1. Goal of the Joint Research and Education Project","paragraphs":["The goal of our joint project is to:  Identify a set of common interdisciplinary research issues and a joint research plan in Human Language Technology, relevant both to spoken and written languages (Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Berber and Native American languages), and  Initiate development of a joint program of study in HLT, which is interdisciplinary, takes advantage of developments in distance education to initially team scholars from the two countries to develop curricula and to teach together, and involves human resource sharing (students, faculty) between the Great Plains and Morocco."]},{"title":"2. Current Status of the Project","paragraphs":["The current status of the project consists in the identification and prioritization of potential:  Language resources (LRs) to be developed for the above cited languages. In this context, we plan to coordinate on this activity with :","(i) The Network of Euro-Mediterranean Language Resources (NEMLAR) project partners whose goal is to create a network of Euro-Mediterranean partners to specify and support the development of high priority LRs for Arabic and other local languages;","(ii) The Institute of Computational Linguistics (Pisa, Italy) and the Ecole Nationale de l Industrie Minerale (Rabat, Morocco) who will be working on the development of LRs and tools that support MT between Arabic and Italian within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the National Center for Scientific and Technical Research (Morocco) and the National Center for Research (Italy);","(iii) The Ecole Nationale de l Industrie Minerale (Rabat, Morocco) and a multi-institutional team who have been working on the development of Standard Arabic generation components for machine translation to Arabic. This project is supported by the National Center for Scientific and Technical Research (Morocco);","(iv) The Institut d Etudes et de Recherche sur l Arabization (Rabat, Morocco) which has a long-standing experience in Arabic Linguistics; and","(v) The Royal Institute of Tamaghizt (Rabat, Morocco) whose specific mission is the promotion of Berber. We are identifying the LRs required for the two research project proposals cited below. ","Application areas (e.g., machine translation,","information extraction, Cross-Language","Information Retrieval). Two research project","proposals are being examined:","(i) an English-Arabic MT system in the domain of finance and","(ii) Automatic Simplification of Arabic Text for Impaired Learners and Foreign Language Learners (Monaco & Smith, 1991, 1989; Soudi, 2004; Soudi & Eisele, 2004; Marsi et al., 2003; Soudi et al., 2003; Soudi et al. 2002b; Soudi et al. 2002a; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 2001). In order to reinforce the research agenda, the GPN and Moroccan partners have been exploring possibilities for initiating a joint Master's degree program in HLT. The courses as well as most of the teaching faculty have been identified. Further details on this joint education program will be available at the Ecole Nationale de l Industrie Minerale website soon. While much of the initial work on the above initial activities has been accomplished, a meeting of collaborators to define scope of research, language resources to be developed, responsibilities and timeline is planned for the third quarter of 2004."]},{"title":"3.
