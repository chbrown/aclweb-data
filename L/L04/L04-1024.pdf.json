In particular, we describe how the XML representation we have dened attempts to address issues of (i) support for different scripts, (ii) partial automation of labeling using recognition engines, (iii) planned as well as casual capture of handwriting data and (iv) semantic annotation of handwriting data at various levels such as character, word and phrase. The representation keeps the raw handwriting data (described by InkML) separate from its semantic interpretations. We also compare and contrast the XML representation with the extant UNIPEN representation for annotation of handwriting data."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Online Handwriting Recognition refers to the interpretation of handwriting captured as digital ink from a suitable pen input device. Digital ink consists of a series of pen positions and optional attributes such as pen tilt and pressure sampled at (typically) uniform intervals of time. Annotated datasets of handwriting covering a variety of writing styles are essential for the development and evaluation of modern data-driven handwriting recognition engines.","Early standards for digital ink such as ITU-T 150 (1988) and Jot (1992) focused on the representation of digital ink and did not address the issue of annotation of handwriting data for handwriting recognition research and development. The lack of a common annotation standard resulted in duplication of data collection efforts for each research effort, and made systematic evaluation and comparison of different recognition algorithms difcult. This issue was rst addressed by the UNIPEN consortium (The UNIPEN Consortium, 1994). The UNIPEN representation employed ASCII at les to store handwriting data and associated annotation. The focus of the UNIPEN effort was on the recognition of cursive English, and the members of the consortium collected and annotated large amounts of handwriting data in the UNIPEN format. However, there have been attempts at creating datasets using the same standard in other languages such as Japanese (Kanji) and Arabic. UNIPEN also made available a set of tools to create annotated datasets from captured handwriting data (Guyon et al., 1994). 1.1. Need for a new standard","While research in online handwriting recognition in the context of Roman and many Oriental scripts has continued unbroken for over three decades and resulted in several commercial engines, the same cannot be said for the majority of the world’s scripts especially in developing countries. The lack of signicant and easily available linguistic resources in the form of annotated datasets of handwriting has been one of the obstacles to research in these scripts. It is clear that many of these resources need to be created, and the creation of such handwriting databases in different scripts calls for a standard representation that is independent of script and allows semantic interpretation of the writing at various user-dened logical levels (e.g. Word, Character). The representation should capture information about script, writing style, quality of writing and truth. It should also capture information about writers and the data capture environment. It should support automatic genera-tion of annotation using recognizers, and subsequent manual validation processes. It should keep handwriting data separate from its semantic interpretations and it should support planned as well as casual data collection.","In this paper, we describe an XML representation for the annotation of handwriting data which addresses these requirements. XML is a natural choice for the representation of annotation because of its naturally hierarchical nature. The representation makes use of an underlying XML representation of the raw handwriting data called Digital Ink Markup Language, a standard being developed by the W3C for the description of digital ink (W3C, 2003). 1.2. Digital Ink Markup Language","Digital Ink Markup Language or InkML for short, has been mooted to provide a platform independent data format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or stylus. The markup is designed to support the input, storage and processing of handwriting, gestures, sketches, music and other notational languages in Web-based applications. It also provides a common format for the exchange of ink data between components such as handwriting and gesture recognizers, signature veriers, and other ink-aware modules. InkML provides means for application-specic extensions. By virtue of being an XML-based language, users may easily add application-specic information to ink les to suit the needs of the application at hand.","The current InkML specication denes a set of core primitive elements useful for any ink application. The trace is the basic element used to record the trajectory of the pen as the user writes digital ink. Details of the input device 219 (digitizer), digitizer channels, and coordinate system comprise the context in which ink is recorded and are captured in Context element. The brush element captures certain attributes of the pen during ink capture. The traceRef and traceRefGroup elements provide the basis for semantic labelling of groups of traces. One of the attributes of traceRefGroup is contentCategory, which may be used to describe at a rudimentary level the category of content that the traces represent; e.g., Text/English, Drawing, Math, Music. These elements are considered as core elements since they are useful for most pen-based applications.","The XML representation described in this paper may be thought of an application-specic extension of the core InkML for the creation of annotated datasets of handwriting data."]},{"title":"2. Representation for Annotated Handwriting Datasets","paragraphs":["Our representation for annotated datasets of handwriting is called hwDataset, and it includes several elements for detailed annotation of handwriting, some of which are derived from the traceRefGroup element of the core InkML. The hwDataset element is the root of the XML document and captures meta-data about the dataset under datasetInfo, various denitions as part of datasetDefs, and hierarchical annotation of handwriting data under hwData (Figure 1). These elements are described briey in the following subsections. Figure 1: The document root element (hwDataset) and its sub-elements 2.0.1. datasetInfo","The datasetInfo element (Figure 2) captures metadata related to the dataset as a whole. It contains the following elements: - name - name for referring to the dataset - category - type of dataset - version - version number and/or datestamp of publication - contact - contact info for dataset-related queries - source - source of collected data - setup - physical conditions in which data was collected - dataInfo - information about the data The DataInfo element in turn contains the following subelements: - script - language/script captured in dataset - quality - quality of handwriting data captured in dataset - truth - truth of what is captured - methodology - design of data and collection procedure - annotationScheme - description of annotation scheme Figure 2: Element capturing metadata about the dataset 2.0.2. datasetDefs","The datasetDefs element (Figure 3) captures information about different writers and sources of labels (annotation) represented in the dataset and provides the means for referring to them later in the document. It contains the following elements: - writerDefs - declarations of writers as a sequence of writer elements - labelSrcDefs - declarations of sources of annotation as a sequence of labelSrc elements The writer element contains the following elements: date - date when writing occurred (meant to be a coarse description as opposed to the trace timestamps in the core InkML) personal - hand - left/right handedness - gender - gender - age - age at the time of capture - skill - level of skill with script - style - predominant writing style - region - native region The labelSrcDefs element contains the following elements: - name - name of the human/automated source of labels - source - organization that this label source represents - time - date and time of annotation - contact - contact details of label source - labelTypes is an attribute and it describes the categories (e.g. truth, quality, script, style, etc) and encodings (e.g. UNICODE) of labels produced by the label source. 220 The above provides a mechanism for representing the writing of different writers in the same dataset, as well as multiple sources and categories of annotation for the same handwriting data. An algorithm for script identication might be used as a source of script labels, while a human annotator may provide labels for truth as well as script, style and quality of writing. Of course, the representation can also accommodate multiple label sources for the same category of label information, e.g. a recognition engine for truth labels and a human annotator for their validation. Figure 3: Element capturing dataset denitions 2.0.3. hwData","The hwData element allows hierarchical organization of data and annotation. It typically contains the root of the annotation hierarchy dened by the user, denoted by the element H1 (Figure 4). Each level of hierarchy H(i) contains a label element that captures annotation information at that level. H(i) also contains either one or more H(i+1) elements or hwTraces, the leaf elements of the hierarchy that refer to raw ink traces represented using InkML (Figure 5). Figure 4: Element capturing annotation Figure 5: Nested hierarchy of annotation","The H(n) elements are meant to be used to indicate the structural makeup of handwriting, and assigned meaningful names such as PARAGRAPH and WORD using the corresponding attributes of the hwData element.","The label element (Figure 6) at each level can be used to capture alternative choices of label with condence values if any, and the timestamp of annotation. Although primarily intended to describe the truth value of a particular set of ink traces, it may also be used for describing other characteristics such as writing style, quality and script. The timestamp can be used to generate the history of annotation spanning different label sources of a particular unit of writing. The alternates can be used to facilitate the process of manual validation by prompting options for human validation. Formally, the attributes of label are id - identication of label labelSrcRef - reference to label source dened earlier. This holds good for sub-levels of the current level except where explicitly overridden category - category of label (e.g. truth, quality, script, style, etc) timestamp - time of the act of annotation Figure 6: Label element with alternates 2.1. Use scenario","The hwDataset representation is meant to be used for annotation of handwriting from both planned data collection as well as casual capture from an ink application such as ink chat. Once the handwriting data has been captured as an InkML document and a suitable hierarchy for annotation dened (e.g., paragraph, word, character), a hwDataset document can be generated in which annotation is organized according to the hierarchy. In case multiple writers are involved, they can be dened in the denitions sec-tion and referred to in any H(n) element. Multiple sources of annotation can then be applied in stages. For example, one or more handwriting recognition engines may be used to generate truth labels (with multiple alternatives) at all of the different hierarchical levels, and the labels manually validated and corrected by a human. The hwDataset document will refer to the raw ink trace elements in the InkML document only in the hwTraces element at the bottom of the hierarchy. Thus annotation is separated from the raw ink, and this arrangement allows multiple hwDataset documents containing annotation to refer to the same ink data. The representation also supports multiple hwData blocks of annotation distinguished by their trialId attribute - a feature designed to support planned data collection. 2.2. Comparison with UNIPEN","The hwDataset representation is to a large extent in-spired by the UNIPEN standard. However, there are some important differences between the two. hwDataset is an XML representation (currently instantiated as a schema) unlike UNIPEN which uses a custom text format. Unlike UNIPEN, hwDataset contains only annotation and does not 221 contain any information about the raw ink data or the digitizer used. These are left to the core InkML schema. This allows the separation of ink and annotation which are combined in the same document in UNIPEN. hwDataset does not include support for evaluation of recognition engines, although it does support their use in the annotation process. As a consequence, UNIPEN elements relating to alphabet used, inline lexicons, characterization of dataset as being training, test or adaptation set and recognition results have been dropped from hwDataset. Also, the data design and wordlists used for planned data collection are meant to be described in separate documents and only referred to in the hwDataset document."]},{"title":"3. Conclusions and Future Directions","paragraphs":["In this paper, an XML representation for hierarchical annotation of online handwriting to support handwriting recognition is described. The representation also supports annotation of other aspects of handwriting such as writing style, quality and script, and accommodates multiple writers and annotation sources. The representation builds upon Digital Ink Markup Language (InkML), a draft specication of digital ink being developed by W3C.","The representation is in a preliminary stage, and we invite comments and suggestions from those engaged in handwriting recognition research and the creation of linguistic resources. We are also currently engaged in prototyping annotation tools based on the representation in the hope that their use for real-world data collection will provide valuable feedback for improving the representation further, especially when used for a variety of scripts."]},{"title":"4.
