The text is viewed as a bag-of-words and the order of words and their position relative to other words is largely ignored. We propose a new method of feature extraction which quantifies the distribution of lexical elements within the text using Kolmogorov complexity estimates. Testing carried out on blog corpora indicates that such measures outperform ratios when used as features in an SVM authorship attribution model. Moreover, by adding complexity estimates to a model using ratios, we were able to increase the F-measure by 5.2-11.8%","",""]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Determining the author of a text is an important problem in computational linguistics. It has applications to plagiarism, copyright infringement and the analysis of anonymously written texts. Normally a machine learning system for authorship attribution extracts features which represent the counts of a variety of lexical elements which are normalized over the length of the text. For example the number of nouns, verbs, common words or punctuation characters may be counted. This is done to fingerprint an author. A model is created based on these features and texts of unknown origin are classified using the model.","The problem with extracting counts of elements is that information is lost. The text is viewed as a bag-of-words and the distribution of elements within the text is ignored. It would be useful to have a method of quantifying the distribution of lexical elements within a text. For example, are most of the common words clustered in one part of the text or are they distributed in a near random fashion throughout the text? If one could quantify the distribution of lexical elements then the question still remains as to whether this is a useful feature for authorship attribution and if so is it as good as or better than using only the counts of lexical elements.","This paper proposes a method of quantifying the distribution of lexical elements by using compression. The set of tokens is represented by a binary string. The Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string is the length of the shortest program which can output the string on a universal Turing machine and then stop (Li, 1997). It can be approximated using any lossless compression algorithm. The degree of compression of the string gives an upper bound on the Kolmogorov complexity (Li, 1997).","In this paper, we use a set of blogs as a training/test corpus and a Support vector machine, or SVM, is used to develop models which predict the author. For each blog, nouns, verbs, pronouns, conjunctions, common words, unique words, internet slang words and punctuation characters were identified. Both normalized counts and complexity estimates were extracted for each lexical element. Thus we have 10 features which are based on traditional normalized counts and 10 features which are based on complexity.","We show that the complexity of lexical elements is a better indictor of style then the normalized count of such elements. In addition because ratio and complexity contain different information, both can be used in an authorship attribution model to boost performance without over fitting. "]},{"title":"2. Authorship Attribution","paragraphs":["Stylometry is concerned with analyzing the linguistic style of text to determine authorship or genre. If one assumes that an author has a consistent style, then one can assume that the author of a text can be identified by analyzing its style.","In order to analyze the style of text, various features are extracted and analyzed. The first attempts at feature extraction focused on treating text as sets of tokens arranged into sentences (Stamatatos, 2000). The extracted features included sentence count, words per sentence, and characters per word. Usually these features were also normalized to the length of the text. These features are still used for classification today.","One can also analyze syntactic features by using a Parts-of-Speech or POS tagger (Stamatatos, 2000). Then the average number of noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases etc. can then be extracted."]},{"title":"3506","paragraphs":["Measures of vocabulary richness are also very important features or style markers (Stamatatos, 2000). One can count the number of words which are very common or the number of words which occur only once or twice. It has been shown that the style of a text can be more easily defined using the presence of common features rather than uncommon features (Uzuner, 2005).","Most work done in authorship attribution and indeed text classification, treat the text as a bag-of-words, that is order does not matter. Aside from research into n-gram models, the placing of words within the text and the location of some words relative to others is ignored. Obviously this results in a loss of information as we are throwing away structure. Traditionally, this has been considered of no importance. "]},{"title":"3. Kolmogorov Complexity  3.1 Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity","paragraphs":["Kolmogorov complexity, also known as algorithmic entropy, stochastic complexity, descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity and program-size complexity, is used to describe the complexity or degree of randomness of a binary string. It was independently developed by Andrey N. Kolmogorov, Ray Solomonoff and Gregory Chaitin in the late 1960s (Li, 1997).","In computer science, all objects can be viewed as binary strings. Thus we will refer to objects and strings interchangeably in this discussion. The Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string is the length of the shortest program which can output the string on a universal Turing machine and then stop (Li, 1997).","Turing showed in his famous work on the halting problem that it is impossible to write a computer program which is able to predict if some other program will halt (Li, 1997). It follows then that even if we find a short program which outputs a particular string there are always other shorter programs and we can never know if one of those programs will halt and if so whether or not they will output the string. Thus it is impossible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string. However there have been methods developed to approximate it.","The Kolmogorov complexity of a string x, denoted as K(x), can be approximated using any lossless compression algorithm (Li, 1997). A compression algorithm is one which transforms a string A, to another shorter string, B. The associated decompression algorithm transforms B back into A or a string very close to A. A lossless compression algorithm is one in which the decompression algorithm exactly computes A from B and a lossy compression algorithm is one in which A can be approximated given B. When Kolmogorov Complexity, or K(x), is approximated, this approximation corresponds to an upper-bound of K(x) (Li, 1997). Let C be any compression algorithm and let C(x) be the results of compressing x using C. The approximate Kolmogorov complexity of x, using C as a compression algorithm, denoted Kc(x), can be defined as follows:"," q","xLength xCLength","xKC +=",")( )))((",")(","","where q is the length in bits of the program which implements C. In practice, q is usually ignored as it is not useful in comparing complexity approximations and it varies according to which programming language implements C. If C was able to compress x a great deal then Kc(x) is low and thus x has low complexity. Likewise if C could not compress x very much then Kc(x) is high and x has high complexity. "]},{"title":"3.2 Using Kolmogorov Complexity Estimates to Classify Objects","paragraphs":["Suppose an object can be viewed as an ordered collection of n items and each item belongs to a class {ci | i = 1, 2, k}. We can then map the object to a string representation which represents the distribution of item classes within the object. Kolmogorov complexity can be used to classify the object by compression this mapping then comparing the degree of compression with the expected compression of different categories of objects. This gives a quantitative measure of the complexity of the distribution if item classes within the object.","It seems intuitive that this can be used for text classification as we can tokenize a text sample and then assign classes to tokens. The Kolmogorov complexity estimate of that distribution can then be used as a feature in machine learning.","One must decide which classes will be used for the Kolmogorov complexity estimates. There is a great deal of flexibility in this but it seems clear that one should consider the meaningfulness of the class and whether or not the distribution of that class is likely to vary among object categories.","Any lossless compression algorithm will estimate Kolmogorov complexity. However, it seems intuitive that when the strings are short, simple compression algorithms will give the best estimate of the complexity. This is because if the string is short, a particular algorithm may compress it a great deal simply by chance. Larger data sets will likely benefit more from efficient compression algorithms as there is a much lower chance that the degree of compression may be an anomaly. Generally, it would not be useful to compute the Kolmogorov complexity of very short strings such as those with length less than 15.",""]},{"title":"3.3 Filtering Spam using Kolmogorov Complexity Measures","paragraphs":["This method of object classification was originally developed for use in spam filters (Seaward, 2007).

For example, a spammer might send the following message:  Buy your Rolexes here!!!!!!!!!  Mary put her purse by the door because she knew she would be leaving again. Suddenly the phone rang and she wondered if Carlos was calling.  ","A human can look at such an email and immediately discern the disparity in style and semantics and declare it spam. However, a filter which views an email as a bags-of-words can be easily fooled into thinking this is a legitimate email.","In order to use Kolmogorov complexity to classify email, we first train the filter to recognize which tokens or words are associated with spam and which are associated with non-spam or ham. Then each email to be classified is tokenized into an ordered set of tokens each of which belongs to the class spam or ham. If we represent ham as 0 and spam as 1 then we may map the email to a string of zeros and ones. The complexity measure is computed by compressing the string using run-length compression,"," ) *2 ,1min(","lengthruns Complexity =","","Each set of consecutive 1s is a run as is each consecutive set of 0s. The runs are counted to determine how much the string could be compressed if one was to encode it as runs of 0s and 1s. For example 11101000 could be encoded as a run of three 1s, followed by a run of one 0, followed by a run of one 1, followed by a run of three 0s.","The complexity of the string is compared to a threshold t and if it is greater than t then the email is classified as spam otherwise it is classified as ham. This method was used to classify email with accuracy of 81-96% (Seaward, 2007).",""]},{"title":"3.5 Attributing Authorship using Kolmogorov Complexity Measures","paragraphs":["Authorship attribution is an interesting problem for Kolmogorov Complexity measures. Tokens or words in a text sample can be divided into many different meaningful classes such as lexical type (noun, verb, preposition etc.); length (short, medium or long); common or uncommon; slang word or proper word etc. It is obvious that the distribution of such measures within the text is a meaningful measure of the style of such a text.","Indeed, Zipfs law states that in any corpus, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table (Manning, 1999). Linguists agree that most language consists of a great many common and possibly ambiguous words with a small number of relatively uncommon and unambiguous words thrown in (Manning, 1999). This is to reduce the burden on the speaker and listener to know and understand many different words and ensure the listener understands the message clearly. However, it is intuitive that this mix of words would be a good way to fingerprint an author as it seems logical that the distribution of such common/uncommon words will vary by author.","The main question that arises is whether the complexity of a features distribution is more meaningful then the count of such a feature. For example is it more meaningful to say the complexity of common words was 0.32 or to say that out of 1000 words, 700 were common. Either measure loses information. Complexity measures lose magnitude. For example, consider the following two strings and suppose 1 represents a common word and 0 represents all other words. The second string has twice as many common words but they have the same complexity."," String Complexity Ratio 00001000010000 0.714 0.143 01111011110000 0.714 0.571"," ","Likewise, if we use ratios, we lose information about how the common words were distributed. For example, the following two strings have the same ratio of 0.5 but very different distributions.  String Complexity Ratio 11111110000000 0.143 0.500 10101010101010 1.000 0.500 ","As we will see in the results section, both measures can be used without overfitting as the both contain information which is useful in fingerprinting an author. Surprisingly however, the complexity of a features distribution performs better than the ratio of that feature when performing authorship attribution. The best results are obtained when both ratio and complexity measures are used.",""]},{"title":"4.

The optimal hyperplane is one which minimizes the risk of misclassifying a data point. The data points which are closest to the maximum margin hyperplane are known as support vectors (Witten, 2005).","Thus for our problem there are 20 dimensions and 9 or 10 classes or authors thus the SVM will find a maximal margin hyperplane which separates each possible pair of classes of which there are 34 or 43.
