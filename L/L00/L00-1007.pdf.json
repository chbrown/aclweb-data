For lexicon encoding, EAGLES elaborated a set of recommendations aimed at covering multilingual requirements and therefore resulted in a large number of features and possible values. Such an encoding, used for tagging purposes, would lead to very large tagsets. For instance, our EAGLES-compliant lexicon required a set of about 1000 morpho-syntactic description codes (MSDs) which after considering some systematic syncretic phenomena, was reduced to a set of 614 MSDs. Building reliable language models (LMs) for this tagset would require unrealistically large training data (hand annotated/validated). Our solution was to design a hidden reduced tagset and use it in building various LMs. The underlying tagger uses these LMs to tag a new text in as many variants as LMs are available. The tag differences between these variants are processed by a combiner which chooses the most likely tags. In the end, the tagged text is subject to a conversion process that maps the tags from the reduced tagset onto the more informative tags from the large tagset. We describe this processing chain and provide a detailed evaluation of the results."]},{"title":"Large tagsets and tiered tagging","paragraphs":["The paper discusses experiments and results concerned with tagging highly inflectional languages, based on multiple register diversified language models (LMs). The case study language is Romanian, for the tagset of which we adopted the internationally accepted set of EAGLES guidelines for morpho-syntactic encoding of lexica. The Romanian lexicon, EAGLES compliant, was built within the MULTEXT-EAST Copernicus Joint Project and the description of its almost half a million wordforms used a set of 614 morpho-syntactic description (MSD) codes. A full description of the encoding scheme we used is given in (Erjavec & Monachini, 1995). Multilingual content analyses of the MULTEXT-EAST lexica and corpora are et al, 1998; Dimitrova et al, 1998).","In order to cope with the inherent problems raised by such a large tagset in statistical morpho-syntactical tagging, we designed a reduced tagset (Ctag-set), which is used for an intermediary tagging, hidden to the beneficiary (human or software) of the disambiguated text. The training corpora were hand annotated in terms of the large MDS tagset. The MSD annotated corpora were automatically converted into Ctag-set annotated ones. The language models that drive the disambiguation of a text were obtained from training the tagger on these Ctag-set annotated corpora. A new text is tagged in terms of the Ctag-set followed by a second processing phase, lexicon driven, which replaces the tags in the hidden tagset with the more informative tags from the large tagset. We call this process tiered tagging.","Thus, with a small price in tagging accuracy (as compared to the direct reduced tagset approach), and practically no price in computational resources, it is possible to tag a text with a large tagset by using language models built for reduced tagsets and reasonably large training data.","The Ctag-set for Romanian consists of 92 tags, plus 10 punctuation tags. The relation between the MSD-set and the Ctag-set is encoded as a mapping table that specifies for each MSD the corresponding Ctag and for each Ctag the set of MSDs that are mapped onto it. The postprocessor that deterministically replaces one Ctag by one or more MSDs, is essentially a database look-up procedure. It takes as input parameters a lexical token plus the Ctag the token was assigned to in the previous phase and returns one or more (2, rarely 3) MSDs. The operation is equivalent to computing the intersection of the ambiguity class of the lexical token and the set of all the MSDs that maps onto the tag assigned to the token in case. As the first set of this intersection depends on the lexical token, it is obvious that a Ctag is not always mapped onto the same MSD or set of MSDs. The tokens that this replacement makes ambiguous are more often than not the difficult cases in statistical disambiguation. Very simple contextual (unification) rules differentiate the interpretations of the few still ambiguous items. These rules investigate (depending on the ambiguity case) left, right or both contexts within a limited distance (in our experiment the maximum span is 4) for a disambiguating tag or wordform. The success rate of this second phase is almost 99%. Below is given such a rule, out of the 14 rules we currently use. The rule disambiguates between possessive pronouns and possessive determiners (a notoriously difficult case for statistical disambiguation): Ps|Ds{Ds.αβδ:(-1 Ncαβδy)|(-1 Af.αβδy)|(-1 Mo.αβδy)| (-2 Af.αβδn & –1 Ts)|(-2 Ncαβδn &-1 Ts)| (-2 Np and –1 Ts)|(-2 D..αβδ and -1 Ts)","Ps. αβδ: true} In the rule above, α,β and δ stand for shared feature values, taking care of agreement in gender, number and case respectively, while ‘.’ stands for the ‘any’ value of the attribute in the corresponding position. For instance, in Ds.αβδ and Ps.αβδ the dot stands for any value of the person attribute, but in Af.αβδy, the dot stands for any value of the “degree of comparison” attribute of the adjective. The (non-recursive) unification mechanism underlying the rule interpreter ensures the attribute value binding. The reading of the rule is as follows: When there exist an ambiguity between a possessive pronoun (Ps.αβδ) and a possessive determiner (Ds.αβδ) if the previous word is tagged as a definite Noun, or a definite Adjective, or a definite Numeral (ordinal), or when the previous two words are tagged as indefinite noun followed by a possessive article or proper noun followed by a possessive article determiner followed by a possessive article then choose the determiner interpretation else if none of above holds choose the pronoun interpretation."]},{"title":"Corpus tagset design","paragraphs":["The design of an Ctag-set from an MSD-tagset is based on a trial & error procedure. A key property required for the Ctag-set is what we call MSD-tagset recoverability, formally described by expression (1). We use the following notations: Wi represents a word from the lexicon (Lex), Ti represents a tag from the reduced tagset (Ctag-set) assigned to Wi, MSDk represents a tag from the MSD-tagset, AMB(Wk) represents the ambiguity class of the word Wk in terms of MSDs (as encoded in Lex), MAP is an application that maps each Ti onto a subset of MSD-set and |X| represents the number of elements of the set X. (1)∀ Ti ∈Ctag-set, MAP(Ti)= {MSD1...MSDk} ⊂ MSD-tagset, ∀Wk∈Lex & AMB(Wk)={MSDk1...MSDkn}⊂MSD-tagset ⇒","The initial phase of the Ctag-set design is described by the","following procedure:","a) extract all ambiguity classes from the lexicon","b) normalize all MSD ambiguity classes","c) for each ambiguity class ACi preserve only intra-categorical ambiguities: ICAij","d) for each ICAi repeat for each MSDij repeat for each attribute Ak in MSDij repeat if eliminating Ak would not reduce any ICA’s card","then remove Ak from all tags and update ICAs else if eliminating Ak would reduce the card for no more than 10% of ICAs then mark Ak as removable endif endif endfor endfor endfor e) for all Ak marked as removable, compute the maximal","set of attributes that minimally reduces the cardinal","of all ICAs (not unique solution) f) for each Ctag-set obtained in the step e) evaluate the","performance In the algorithm sketched above, step b) was introduced to deal with the feature values syncretism while step c) was motivated by the empirical observation that, for highly inflectional languages, inter-categorical misclassifications are much less frequent then intra-categorical ones. The following MSD ambiguity class displays only inter-categorical ambiguities, therefore no ICA will be created (LC represents the number of distinct wordforms in the lexicon that are associated with this ambiguity class): MSD-ACi=(Afpms-n Ncms-n Vmp--sm) LC =715 On the other hand, the ambiguity class MSD-ACj, containing intra-categorical ambiguities would generate two ICAs: MSD-ACj=(Ncfp-n Ncfson Vmis3s Vmm-2s Vmnp)LC=33 ICAj1=(Ncfp-n Ncfson), ICAj2=(Vmis3s Vmm-2s Vmnp).","The step d) implements the MSD-tagset recoverability property previously discussed. The last step of the algorithm transforms the annotation of the training corpus according to each candidate Ctag-set, builds the classifiers, tags the test corpora and evaluates the accuracy. For the examples above, one could eventually get: Ctag-ACi=(ASN NSN VP) and respectively Ctag-ACj = (NPN NSON V3 V2 VN).","The procedure above does not necessarily lead the designer to an “optimal” Ctag-set. The main reason is that some eliminated attributes, although fully recoverable, if preserved, might act as contextual restrictors for the ambiguity classes in the neighborhood. We figured out such cases by the introspective analysis of the confusion sets, automatically extracted in the training phase (see the credibility profile discussed in the next section) and reintroduced some previously eliminated attributes."]},{"title":"Combining multiple classifiers","paragraphs":["Before the final tagset mapping, optionally, one could use a combined classifier to improve the quality of the Ctag tagging of the text. The basic assumption in trying to combine different classifiers, even of comparable accuracy, is that they do not make identical errors (Brill & Wu, 1998; Adda et al 1998). This assumption was confirmed by all the experiments we are aware of.","To make thinks clearer, we should specify that what we call a (basic) classifier is a trained tagger, that is the tagging engine plus the learnt LM. If any of these two components is changed, we speak about another classifier. Thus, if one has at his/her disposal K tagging engines and N training corpora, he/she could construct K*N (basic) classifiers.","Given that each classifier has its own view on the processed text TX (encoded in its underlying LM), it is very unlikely for the k versions of TX to be identical. However, as compared to the truth (a human judged annotation), the probability for an arbitrary token from TX to be assigned the correct interpretation in at least one of  > = cases 10% than lessfor 1 cases 90% than morefor 1 )AMB(W )MAP(T ki the k versions of TX is very high (in general, more than 99%). Let us call the hypothetical guesser of this correct tag an oracle (as it is called in (Brill & Wu, 1998)). Implementing an oracle, i.e. automatically deciding which of the k interpretations is the correct one, is a very difficult problem. However, the oracle concept, as defined above, is very useful since its accuracy gives an estimation of the upper bound of correctness that can be achieved by a given classifier combination. The oracle’s errors are represented by those cases where no classifier came out with the correct tag.","The experiment described in (v.Halteren et al, 1998) is based on the tagged LOB corpus and uses four different taggers: a 3gram HMM tagger (Steetskamp, 1995), a memory-based tagger (Daelemans et all, 1997), a rule-based tagger (Brill, 1995) and a ME-based tagger (Radnaparkhi, 1996). The oracle’s accuracy is estimated at 99.22%. Several decision-making strategies are proposed, out of which the pair-wise voting strategy outscored all the individual classifiers (97.92%).","An almost identical point of view and similar results are reported in (Brill & Wu, 1998). Their experiment is based on the Wall Street Journal corpus and uses a HMM 3gram tagger, a rule-based tagger (Brill, 1995) and a ME-based tagger (Radnaparkhi, 1996). In that case, the estimated accuracy of the oracle is 98.59% (apparently, WSJ contains more annotation errors than LOB), and using the pick-up tagger combination method, an overall accuracy of 97.2% was obtained.","Our methodology, even though similar at first sight to the ones discussed above, is actually different: instead of using several taggers and the same training data, it uses one tagger (a 3gram-HMM) and trains it on several register-corpora. A new text is independently tagged with each classifier, in as many versions as classifiers are available. These slightly different versions are further combined into the final tagged text. We claim that our approach, which could be based on any particular tagger (ideally, the best one), is more linguistically motivated, as any differences showing up in the output of the individual classifiers are justified only by the linguistic data used in the training. This fact could be used for a rough estimation of the text type/genre/register.","We made experiments with two 3-gram HMM taggers Brants, 1998). Each tagger was separately trained on 4 distinct register-diversified corpora, constructing 4 language models for each tagger. We constructed in this way 8 basic classifiers (2 taggers * 4 training corpora). A new text (unseen, from an unknown register) was independently tagged with each individual classifier. Our combiner interpolated the results provided by the different basic classifiers, with an always better accuracy than that of any basic classifier. On average, the combined classifier made 10.95% fewer errors when compared with the best performing basic classifier and 28,96% fewer errors when compared with the worst performing individual classifier. We checked the statistical significance of the improvement (using McNemar’s test) and for all possible pairs, the combined classifier was confirmed to have a different expected behavior from any basic classifier (better).","An interesting finding was that out of the possible classifiers, the best combinations were obtained when the basic classifiers were constructed with the same tagger. The average accuracy of the combined classifier tagger was about 98.5%. We made experiments with various combiners (simple majority, weighted majority voting etc). The best performing one is called CREDIBILITY. This combiner is driven by a set of credibility profiles (one for each classifier). The kth","credibility profile is automatically constructed from evaluating the kth","classifier on the text resulted by concatenating all the training corpora. A credibility profile specifies for each tag Ti the probability estimates of recall Rk","(T","i) and precision Prk (T","i), as well as a confusion set. If HTi is the number of tags Ti used in the training corpus, MTi is the number of tags Ti assigned in the machine-tagged corpus, MTiR is the number of rightly assigned Ti tags (out of MTi) then, we define Prk","(T","i) as MTiR/MTi and Rk (T i) as MTiR/HTi. The","confusion set for a tag Ti consists of pairs <Tj Pck","(T j|Ti)>,","with Tj a tag that is confused with Ti, and Pck (T","j|Ti) the probability estimate for such a confusion.

Initially, this was a slightly modified version of O. Mason’s QTAG tagger (available, licence-based, from the author). It uses a local optimization strategy, a sliding 3-word window with the word of interest in the 1st , 2nd","and 3rd","position respectively. In order to verify that the designed Ctag-set was not over-tuned and biased by the peculiarities of QTAG, we have repeated the same experiments with another 3gram tagger, namely TnT due to T. Brants (available licence-based, from the author). TnT uses the same input/output format but, unlike QTAG, it uses global optimization in tagging (Viterbi algorithm). The evaluation showed different results for the two taggers, but, in both cases, our basic claim was confirmed: TT-CLAM methodology ensured high accuracy in tagging with a large tagset.","The Table 5 shows the results of the evaluation process for 8 single classifiers and 2 combined classifiers (CLAM), built based on the two taggers (QTAG and TnT) and four training corpora (Orwell’s “1984”, Plato’s “The Republic”, News and Global). They were run on three texts unseen before, representing chunks of approximately 20,000 words from the previously mentioned 3 test corpora (“1994”, “barnes” and “ziarNou”).","The column Text/LM specifies the chunk of the test text that was tagged by using the classifier based on the LM training corpus. The Size column specifies the number of lexical items in the chunk. The Amb1 describes the average ambiguity of the tagged text. The #unk column specifies the number of unknown items in the test text. The Accuracy and #errors columns describe, for each tagger used in building a classifier, the percentage of correct tag assignments (number of correctly assigned tags versus the number of tags) and the absolute number of errors, respectively. Accuracy was computed as 100*(1-#errors/Size). For instance, “1994_20/Republic” is a chunk, containing 20110 items, extracted from “1994” test corpus, tagged with a classifier built by training QTAG and TnT on the “Republic” corpus. The QTAG-based classifier made 425 errors while the TnT-based classifier made 427 errors, thus the accuracy of the two classifiers was 97.88% and 97.87% respectively. As one can see, the CLAM classifier was always the best performer, irrespective of the used tagger and the test text. Table 5 also shows that the classifiers based on the Global LM were almost always the second-best ones (except for the text ziarNou_20).","This supports the known fact that more training data improves the tagging performance but also sustains our conjecture: dividing a balanced training corpus into register-specific training corpora and using a combined LM classifier may increase the tagging performance.","It is worth noting that after error analysis, we found out that the non-Romanian word “qua” occurred in “barnes_20” 81 times, used as a close-class category (conjunction). Similarly, the text “ziarNou” contained 43 occurrences of the item “lu” (used, for stylistic purposes, as a slang form of the pronoun “lui”). The figures in Table 5 show a better performance for the classifiers constructed with TnT. However, when the two anomalous words were normalized (“qua” and “lu” were defined as aliases for the conjunction “ca” and the pronoun/article “lui”, respectively), besides a dramatic accuracy improvement of all classifiers (more than 1,5%), we noticed that the QTAG-based classifiers performed approximately as well as the TnT-based ones.

Table 6 displays the results of this second experiment. Without unknown items, the differences in the accuracy of tagging the same text with the same LM could be explained by the optimization technique used by the two taggers. The experiment supported the idea that global optimization is in general better than the local one, unless too many unknown words are present in the input text. In order to estimate the effect of a wrong guess on the overall tagging accuracy with respect to the global/local optimization strategy, we computed a correlation factor μ =1-NPL/ NFL. NPL represents the number of tags wrongly assigned in a text containing unknown words (partial lexicon) and NFL stands for the number of tags wrongly assigned in the same text, with no unknown words (full lexicon). One should like the value of μ as low as possible: 0 means either a perfect guesser or a strictly nonpropagating error. The table 7 shows the experimental values for the μ factor. The OK column shows, for each classifier and each optimization strategy, the number of correctly tagged tokens out of the total number of unknown ones (#unk). Although the percentage of unknown token recovery is better for the GLOBAL strategy than for LOCAL strategy with all classifiers, μGLOBAL is always greater than μLOCAL, implying that the effect of a wrong guess is reduced in local optimization approach. Put it otherwise, when using a global optimization strategy in tagging, the quality of a very good guesser is of utmost importance.","Another worth making remark concerns the accuracy of the part-of-speech-only disambiguation.

While in the first case (more difficult), the information in the hidden layer of tags is enhanced, in the second case (very simple) the unnecessary information in the hidden layer of tags is left-out by a filter."]},{"title":"Implementation ","paragraphs":["The TT-CLAM methodology, described in this paper, is underlying the implementation of a plug-in UNIX environment for tagging, called LINGUASTAT. The tagging process is implemented in a client/server architecture, with the classifiers running in parallel on various servers.","In Figure 1 there is a screen snapshot from a working session with LINGUASTAT. The Setup menu (the bottom-right corner window in Figure 1) shows the main components identified by the following tabs: mtSeg (a Multext segmenter variant), qTagger (QTAG), Tagging (TnT), recover (the module which maps the Ctags onto MSDs), ruler (the rule-based disambiguation), Long pipe (a configuration utility for defining a processing pipe), Combined... (the LM combined classifier) and statistics (several evaluation functions and tests).","LINGUASTAT has also a compare and edit facility (the upper window and the small window below it in Figure 1). The text tagged by various classifiers is displayed in separate windows. The differences among the classifiers are highlighted, so that, by stepping through them (pressing the Next button), a human post-editor may validate and correct the final tagging. This way, the extension/creation of a training corpus is sped up at least  the percentage of wrong agreements between classifiers is extremely low (0,59%-0,83%), so that inspecting only the highlighted disagreements (2,85%-3,3%) is quite safe. Figure 1: A snapshot from a LINGUASTAT session Based on the technology described in this paper we implemented a public application for highly accurate (close to 99%) automatic insertion of diacritics into  the diacritics insertion is superior to the performance of the tagging process since many intra-categorical errors done by the underlying tagger, are harmless for the right decision on inserting or not a diacritical sign.","The language resources and the software are available for research purposes and are distributed by TELRI association through TRACTOR user service."]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":["The evaluation results show several important things:"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["tiered tagging (tagging a text by a hidden tagset layer followed by the recovery of the information in the initial tagset) allows for successful use of statistical methods in the processing of highly inflectional languages (in our case Romanian);"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["the methodology we presented is not language dependent.

The human expert annotator can concentrate quite safely on the disagreement cases; with an average 3% (in our experiments) of tag disagreement, the hand validation of large training corpora is a manageable task. It is worth observing that, in our experiments, we have not observed any instance of disagreement between the 4 classifiers where the right tag was not proposed by at least one of them."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The work reported here built on the main results of the Multext-East European project (COP106/1995) and was partly funded by the Romanian Academy grant (GAR#188/1997)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Adda, G., Mariani, J., Lecompte, J., Paroubek, P., Rajman, M. “The GRACE French Part-of-Speech Tagging Evaluation Task”.In Proceedings of First International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, Granada, Spain, 1998, 433-441.","Berger, A.L., Della Pietra, S.A., Della Pietra, V.J. “A Maximum Entropy Approach to Natural Language Processing” In Computational Linguistics, vol. 22, no. 1, March 1996, 39-72.","Brants, Th. “TnT- A Statistical Part-of-Speech Tagger” Instalation and User Guide, University of Saarland, Computational Linguistics, March 1998.","Brill, E., Wu, J. “Classifier Combination for Improved Lexical Disambiguation” In Proceedings of COLING-ACL’98 Montreal, Canada, 1998, pp. 191-195.","Brill, E. “Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning and Natural Language Processing: A Case Study in Part of Speech Tagging.” Computational Linguistics, 21(4), 1995, pp. 543-565.","Daelemans, W., Zavrel, J., Berck, P., Gillis, S, “A Memory-Based Part-of-Speech Tagger Generator.
