This is achieved through comparison of the selectional preference annotation on corresponding case slots, based on the assumption that selectional preferences are preserved under alternation. Three separate extraction methods are considered, founded around: (1) simple match of selectional restrictions; (2) selectional restriction matching, with recourse to penalised backing-off; and (3) semantic density, again with recourse to backing-off."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This is an attempt to document the full range of verb alternations in Japanese from analysis of structural regularities between entries in a valency dictionary, and determine the degree of permeation of each individual alternation type. Various techniques are analysed for extracting alternations, focusing on full or partial preservation of the selectional restrictions describing each case slot, and the degree of restriction of the selectional restrictions. These methods operate around the assumption that selectional restrictions are essentially unchanged under alternation.)","Verb alternations have been the target of considerable research within linguistic circles, in terms of describing the range of alternations for a particular language (e.g. (Levin 1993) for English and (Fukui et al. 1985) for Japanese), applying alternations to model verbal semantics (e.g. (Levin 1993; Hale & Keyser 1987)), or analysing alternating potential and interpretational differences between verbs in different clause contexts (e.g. (Goldberg 1995; Wierzbicka 1988)). More recently, alternations have been the object of interest within the natural language processing community, for use in lexical selection in natural language generation (Dorr & Olsen 1996; Jing & McKeown 1998), and as a means of expanding dictionary coverage (Baldwin et al. 1999b). There has also been some work on automatically extracting verbs which undergo particular alternations from corpora (McCarthy","Korhonen 1998). Our work represents a variation on this same theme, whereby we compare the different senses 2 of a given verb within the Goi-Taikei pattern-based valency dictionary (Ikehara et al. 1997; Shirai et al. 1997), and exhaustively determine all possible mappings between each valency frame pair. Naturally, not all such mappings are going to constitute true alternations, but by scoring each mapping and combining the scores for each mapping paradigm over all dictionary entries, it is hoped that alternations will find themselves into the top-ranking analyses. One area in which this research attempts to break new ground is, therefore, the fully-unsupervised extraction of alternations.","Our purpose in extracting alternations is twofold. Firstly, we are interested in determining the possibilities for collapsing dictionary entries together through dynamic generation of regular alternations. Preliminary research on exactly this subject indicates that the use of prominent alternation types produces a reduction of almost 9% in the number of senses (Baldwin et al. 1999a), suggesting that a fuller set of alternations could produce even greater reduction. Secondly, we are interested in deriving the inventory of Japanese alternations through automatic means, for comparison against previous analyses of alternations in Japanese. The main point of reference is the work of Jacobsen (1992) in given a relatively complete coverage of \"event structure\" and particularly structural alternation in Japanese.","We test out three main methods to extract alternations, the first being based on full coincidence of selectional restrictions (method 1— (m i )), the second incorporating semantic backing-off to capture slight disagreements in selectional restrictions (method 2 — (m2 )), and the third scoring each alternation according to the quality of the match, in terms of the strength of the selectional restrictions","1 Throughout this paper, we will tend to talk exclusively of selectional restrictions, where we mean both selectional restrictions and lexical fillers. Coincidence of selectional restrictions, therefore, refers to full coincidence of the range of lexical fillers as well as agreement in the selectional restriction content. Backing-off, on the other hand, applies only to selectional restrictions.","2 A verb sense is defined as the Japanese component of a single Japanese–English transfer pattern. 3 and degree of overlap (method 3 — (m,3 )) . For each, we test the effects of exhaustive vs. highest-ranking analysis between case frames, and apply Zipf's law in weighting each case frame for expected frequency.","In the next section (Section 2), we define what we mean by alternation and outline the assumptions underlying this research. We then go on to describe the basic extraction methodology in Section 3, and detail the three proposed methods in Sections 4 to 6, describing the results obtained for each approach as we go. Section 7 concludes the paper with a discussion of the future direction of this research. 2 Definitions dgz assumptions We define alternation as: systematic inter-case frame variation operating at the case marker, (canonical) word order and/or valency levels, and also possibly involving adverbials and reflexivisation","Alternation is thus a directed binary relation, linking non-coincident case frames. We term the pair of","case frames undergoing alternation an alternating pair, from the base case frame to the target","case frame. This process can be illustrated by the following examples, with the indicated selectional","restrictions on each case slot:3","(1)\\ta.

Note that the first two of these are analysed as valency-reducing alternations, but the last as a valency-increasing alternation. Our reason in this is the general applicability of the synthetic causative and markedness of synthetic causative verb inflection. Additionally, the first two alternation types operate over a closed set of verbs, with localised selectional preferences for alternating case slots, whereas the synthetic causative is applicable for a much less well-defined set of verbs and introduces an argument of essentially fixed selectional restrictions. Predictability of affected argument type and the ability to describe an alternation by way of a generalised template are requirements on alternations.","3 The following abbreviations are used in sentence glosses: NOM = nominative, ACC = accusative, DAT = dative, # = semantically infelicitous. Any given selectional restrictions are for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the content of the Goi-Taikei valency dictionary. —4—","Example (4) provides an example of a valency-preserving case marker alternation.","We make the assumption that alternations producing modification of the argument structure will either add or delete arguments, with these two processes never occurring simultaneously within a single alternation. That is we can never have, for example, a valency-preserving, argument structure-modifying alternation. We additionally stipulate that the case frame must be modified in some way under alternation.4","By associating a direction with each alternation, we are forced into stipulating which of the two affected case frames is basic, a question which is clearly beyond the capability of an automatic extraction system. For the time being, we get around this by enforcing the constraint that alternations must be either valency-preserving (i.e. not modify the argument structure) or valency-reducing. Additionally, for valency-preserving alternations, we normalise the direction of the alternation so as to be able to combine analysis of all like alternations together. In effect, all this achieves is to remove representational multiplicity and allow us to maximally cluster like alternations together in determining the overall permeance of each alternation type, as all valency-increasing alternations are captured in reverse form as valency-decreasing alternations. Admittedly, however, this does produce misrepresentation in that the synthetic causative from (3) above, for example, is analysed as occurring in reverse to the direction claimed above.","The research in this paper relies heavily on the following Assumption of Preservation of Selectional Restrictions (\"APSR\"), originally proposed in Baldwin et al. (1999b): Selectional restrictions are essentially unchanged under alternation, with any idiosyncratic sub-preferences being defeasible given appropriate context In this, we do not seek to refute the \"Principle of No Synonymy of Grammatical Forms\" (Goldberg 1995:p 3) that different syntactic realisations necessarily produce different meanings, or in other words that the members of an alternating pair display some difference in meaning or focus/topicality. Rather, we make the claim that corresponding case slots in the two case frames will display the same basic range of case fillers.","It is relatively easy to fashion what would appear to be counter-examples to this claim.","(5) I rolled the box up the slope (6) # The box rolled up the slope (7) The anti-gravitational ball rolled up the slope","(8) The box came hurtling down the hill and rolled up the slope Despite the high acceptability of the transitive alternate of roll in (5), infelicity is produced for the unaccusative alternate in (6). However, closer observation of these sentences reveals that the issue at stake here is not whether the subject of the unaccusative roll can be instantiated with box, but that the act of rolling must be inherently facilitated. Hence, given a subject such as an anti-gravitational ball which has the innate ability to move up slopes, (7) becomes perfectly acceptable, and similarly, given a context in which we can see that the box has sufficient momentum to roll up a slope, felicity is produced as seen in (8). As such, the factor blocking the acceptability of (6) is not so much selectional restrictions as pragmatic interpretation.","A more serious threat to the validity .of the APSR is the effects of definiteness and volitionality, and the observation that the focusing of indefinite arguments over definite arguments, or involitional arguments over volitional arguments through alternation, often produces ungrammaticality. Also, overly long arguments (in terms of linear length) sometimes alternate where shorter arguments with the same basic semantic head would not, or vice versa. Here, we take the line that universal grammatical and lexical principles can overrule basic alternations, but that given the correct definiteness value, volitionality and linear length of arguments, alternating case slots will display the same range of filler types in all realisations."]},{"title":"3 Basic methodology","paragraphs":["The basic methodology employed to extract alternation candidates is to take a verb dictionary annotated with selectional restrictions, exhaustively determine correspondences between lexically related items, and look for regularities in the patterns of correspondence. By 'lexically related items' is meant that the two verbs in question must share a kanji prefix. This greatly reduces the search space and at the same time maintains a tenuous semantic link between items considered for alternation.","4 1n extraction, this final stipulation filters off intra-case frame alternations analogous to\\t[(ca-,c0)(co--,c,,)], – see below for a description of this notation."]},{"title":"3.1 The dictionary","paragraphs":["The particular dictionary targeted for extraction is the verb component of the Goi-Taikei pattern-based valency dictionary, comprising 5241 stem verb tokens and 13822 case frame instances. Each case frame contains one or more case slots, each annotated with lexical fillers and/or selectional restrictions, with the case slots listed in canonical order. One aspect of the Goi-Taikei valency dictionary which we rely on to weight case frames according to expected frequency of occurrence, is the listing of the case frames in order of sense saliency. That is, the first-ranking entry for a given verb type is the most prominent sense for that verb, the second-ranking entry the second most prominent sense, and so on.","The selectional restriction annotation is linked to the Goi-Taikei thesaurus by way of one or more nodes in the thesaurus tree structure.","As described above, this whole stream of research is founded on the assumption that alternations are characterised by preservation of selectional restrictions. In terms of the extraction process, we must have implicit faith not only in our hypothesis but also the consistency of the lexicographers who created the dictionary. We return to this point in the discussion of the various extraction techniques.","Another precondition on the success of this research is that the target valency dictionary contains a full spectrum of alternations for us to unearth. We expect more prominent alternations to get better coverage partly because of their genuine commonality, but also because of their salience in the minds of a lexicographer when adding an entry undergoing that alternation to the valency dictionary. We should therefore not be surprised to see very high frequency for core alternations, and much lesser frequency for relatively peripheral alternations.","The Goi-Taikei pattern-based valency dictionary was originally designed for use with the ALT-J/E transfer-based machine translation system (Ikehara et al. 1991). This has implications for this research in terms of the criteria used to partition off case frames (i.e. verb senses), in that polysemous verbs with a correspondingly polysemous English translation will generally be described as a single case frame. In the event that the alternates of the Japanese case frame are associated with distinct English translations, multiple alternates will be produced, with selectional restrictions tuned to differentiate usage of the alternates (Baldwin et al. 1999b). In cases such as this, therefore, selectional preferences will not be preserved under alternation, due to inter-lingual idiosyncrasies rather than a genuine clash with our APSR.","Perhaps a more immediate concern is what to do in cases of analytical ambiguity, such as when multiple case slots in one case frame agree with the selectional restrictions on one or more case slots in the other case frame. Here, how do we determine which of the analytical possibilities is correct? Below, we consider different methods for resolving such ambiguity."]},{"title":"3.2 Representing alternations","paragraphs":["Extracted alternations are represented as the tuple ( [SUFF],[ARGS], SCORE), where SUFF is the directed non-corresponding suffix component between alternates, ARGS is the directed case slot correspondence and SCORE is a numeric statement of the plausibility of the alternation, SCORE E [0, 1]. For example, we represent the alternation (2a) \\t(2b) from above as:5","( , [(NPi{ga}—q) (NP2{o}—{ga})],1) That is, the verbs for the base and target case frames coincide, the base nominative (ga) case slot is deleted, and the base accusative (o) case slot alternates with the target nominative (ga) case slot.

All case slots for the target case frame must be matched up with a corresponding case slot in the base case frame, with any unmatched case slots in the base case frame considered to have been deleted (producing a valency-decreasing alternation). By insisting that all target case slots are mapped to, we are able to maintain our excluding constraint on valency-increasing alternations.","To return to our original alternating pair examples, the following alternations would be extracted","5 A SUFF value of :̀ indicates that the verb lexicalisation is unchanged under alternation (i.e. the alternation is analytic)."]},{"title":"from the indicated case frames (verbs have been reverted to their base forms):","paragraphs":["K[meru/maru],[(NP i tgal---4) (NP 2 fol--->fgal)],"]},{"title":"1)\\t(1a)--,(1b) K [-] ,","paragraphs":["[(NPi{ga}-4) (NP2{o}-{ga})], 1)\\t (2a)--9(2b) ([_],[(NPi{ga}-0) (NP2fol---,{ga})],0.5)\\t"]},{"title":"(3b)-+(3a) [-] ,","paragraphs":["[(NP 1 {ga}) (NP2{o}-4)], 0.5)\\t"]},{"title":"(3b)-+(3a) [(NP i lnif-{ga})","paragraphs":["(NP2fgal--->{o})],"]},{"title":"1)\\t","paragraphs":["(4a)-÷(4b)"]},{"title":"With (3b) and (3a) above, we are immediately faced with the issue of analytical ambiguity and what to do in the case of multiple potential alternations existing between case frames.

Looking first to the output of the general method, with score normalisation but without applying Zipf's law, we find the causative/inchoative and unspecified object alternations to be by far the most common alternation types.

The trans-lingual nature of the valency dictionary came out in the fact that the passive alternation was ranked 9th and the synthetic causative alternation ranked 16th (i.e. we would not expect synthetic alternations to occur as separate entries in a monolingual dictionary unless there was some departure in meaning/usage between the alternates). The scarcity of alternations in data is highlighted by the alternation at rank 30 having a frequency of 5 with score normalisation activated, especially given the total number for possible verb frame combinations. We are down below a frequency of 4 beyond rank 52, at which many of the alternations are either dubious or super-alternations of other higher-ranking alternations (i.e. alternations which have contributed to the increased count of alternations above them through clustering). The relative frequency of the unspecified object alternation seems artificially inflated, suggesting that there had been analytical ambiguity between the causative/inchoative unspecified object alternations at various points. Inspection of the data with ambiguity ducking bears out this prediction to some degree, with the causative/inchoative alternation outscoring the unspecified object alternation 104 to 66, but these two alternation types still occupying the top two positions. Otherwise, the relative ordering of alternations with ambiguity ducking is identical to that with score normalisation for the top 9 ranking alternations. Evoking Zipf's law in weighting case frame pairings produces a slightly different ranking of alternations to the basic method with score normalisation, with the causative/inchoative coming out on top as for the ambiguity ducking method but the passive alternation going right down to a rank of 101. At the same time, the synthetic causative alternation is bumped up to a rank of 11 from 16 and non-analytic alternations are generally ranked higher (with 17 non-analytic alternations in the top 30). We expect lexical and compound-based alternations to be ranked higher under Zipf's law, as the scores for alternations deriving from different verbs is always going to be slightly higher than that for alternations deriving from a single verb, given that alternations will not be competing for a portion of the same single frequency count. The higher ranking for the synthetic causative alternation (where the base and target case frames share the same verb stem) is exceptional in this respect, and indicative of the affected case frames both comprising salient verb usages, unlike the passive alteration (where again the base and target case frames share the same verb stem), for which either or both case frames are relatively peripheral in general.

Given two case slots c and d, we match up the selectional restrictions by taking each node ei from the selectional restriction description of c and attempting to match it in the selectional restriction description of d. In the case of a perfect match not being attained, we search for the closest node to This is achieved by determining the lowest common supernode (\"LCS\") of c, and each di described in the selectional restrictions for d, and returning a score describing the relative effort required to coerce Ci and di to that LCS.","We define the match quality mq(s i , s2 ) in aligning selectional restrictions s 1 and s 2 as: mq(s i , s2 ) _ \\t \\t(1)depth(s i )\\tdepth(s 2 ) depth(super(s i , 82)) where super(s i , 82 ) returns the lowest common supernode of s 1 and s 2 , and depth(n) returns the depth to node n as the number of nodes in the path from the thesaurus root to rt, inclusive.

This is achieved through the notion of \"semantic density\" . 6.1 The (m3 ) extraction procedure As for (mi ) and (m2 ), we consider only case frames which share a common kanji stem, and exhaustively generate all possible alternations between them. We also allow for semantic backing-off in a manner similar to (m2 ). With (m3 ), however, we balance up the degree of backing-off against the quality of the produced match, such that matches in the lower reaches of the thesaurus structure are scored higher than those matching higher up. This is achieved by scoring matches according to the semantic density of the region described by the matched selectional restrictions.","Semantic density is an indication of the degree of specificity of a given semantic region, as determined according to the thesaurus topology. Consider Fig. 1 below. Here, region R3 is more dense than regions R2 or R1 , in the sense that concepts contained within R3 would have greater cohesion that those in the other two regions. If selectional restrictions are given this degree of specificity, it must mean that the associated case slot is highly specialised in its usage and that the lexicographer encoding the selectional restrictions is confident as to the demarkation of use of that case slot. A match at this high level of specialisation tends to have greater credibility than a match at a higher level, and point to genuine case slot correspondence. Figure 1: Semantic density","We model semantic density-based match quality according to case slot restrictiveness (CSR) (Baldwin & Tanaka 1999).

Comparing our output to the alternation types described by Jacobsen (1992), we have been able to reproduce all the main alternation types, including lexical alternations if at a lower raking than we had expected. Jacobsen gives no indication of the commonality of the different alternations he describes, however, so that we have no way of relating the relative rankings of alternations to his work.","Intuitively speaking, we would have expected lexical alternations to play a more prominent role. As mentioned above, one reason for their low profile is annotational inconsistency, as evidenced by the different rankings of lexical alternations with and without semantic backing-off. One other factor alluded to above, is that the dictionary was always intended for machine translation, making translational sufficiency the absolute evaluation criterion on dictionary quality. Thus, that hazimeru should have a single entry with English translation \"startTRANS\" but its lexical unaccusative alternate hazimaru have fully 21 separate entries each with a distinct English translation, 6 is perhaps not disturbing to the system developer, but it certainly does not help our case.","One condition observed for all methods is that ambiguity is not being resolved adequately, with high-frequency misanalyses producing noise in the data. In certain cases, heuristics such as preferring alternations where alternation of surface case is minimised, could be successful in removing such ambiguity, although this would have the unfortunate side-effect of discounting causative-inchoative alternations, for example.","It is true that the different methods were able to produce different effects, particularly in the ranking of average scores for each alternation type. The combined scores produced by (m l ) are perhaps most indicative of the true coverage of the different alternations in the dictionary, the mean score for (m2 ) the most indicative of the shakiness of certain alternations, and the mean score for (m3 ) the most indicative of true alternation quality. By complementing these methods with Zipf's law, lexical alternations seem to fall out more noticeably. One clear result to appear from all methods was that the causative/inchoative and unspecified object alternations are the two most pervasive alternation types. This is with the caveat that the high salience of the unspecified object alternation can be put down to, again, the leaning of the dictionary towards machine translation, and nonexistence of an English verb taking that same alternation.","The observant reader may have been surprised at the vast number of alternation tokens produced for (m2 ) and (m3 ) in particular. The main contributing factors here are: (a) analytical ambiguity, and the system returning all possible mappings between case frames, irrespective of plausibility; and (b) the inclusion/exclusion of middle case slots producing multiple variants of the same basic case frames. Analytical ambiguity can be ignored for the large part, due to implausible alternations being","6 Admittedly, 17 of these were targeted at the stockmarket domain, but there were still four generalised entries to hazimaru's one. — 13 — heavily penalised. Alternation clustering removes the effects of middle case slots in the cumulative frequency ranking, although we found them appearing in mean score rankings.","Looking to the future, the next step in this research will be to apply the extracted alternations in developing translation rules to fully reproduce the target case frame from the alternation compatibility-annotated base case frame. We are also interested in looking at the patterns of selectional restriction variation under alternation, to determine whether the inconsistency seen for lexical alternations, for example, is highly regular and goes against our APSR. Either way, we should be able to detect errors in selectional restrictions for use in tuning the dictionary.","A further area in which we hope to apply this research is in the identification and categorisation of both lexical and semantic correspondences in the data. For example, it should be possible to postulate alternating lexical pairs through the degree of correspondence of their various case frames. To take this process one step further, it should also be possible to identify alternating semantic pairs such as buy/sell and win I lose, by relaxing our constraint on alternates having to share a common lexical stem.
