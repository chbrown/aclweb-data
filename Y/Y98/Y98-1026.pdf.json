It is based on the information taken from semantic similarities, selectional restrictions, and some other linguistic cues. We discuss the role the information plays in resolving ambiguities that appear in coordinate constructions, describe the means of acquiring the necessary information automatically from two on-line corpora and a lexical database, and devise two algorithms for disambiguating coordinate constructions. An experiment that follows shows effectiveness of our method and its applicability to resolving ambiguities in some other syntactic structures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Syntactic ambiguity appears, among others, in coordinate constructions. It is an annoying problem in analyzing structure and meaning of a sentence. A parser, for instance, is to detect the scope of a coordinate structure and identify its inner modification relations. However, the current parsers (e.g., the Link parser) often fail to handle the problem and/or produce a large number of parses.","There are a few computational studies that have tried to resolve ambiguities in coordinate constructions (e.g., Paritong, 1992; Cooper, 1991; Bayer, 1996). For example, Kurohashi and Nagao (1994), in analyzing long Japanese sentences, proposed a syntactic analysis method for detecting conjunctive structures by using lexical similarity and structural parallelism. Mela and Fouquere (1996) used a direct process to determine the scope of a coordinate structure based on the concept of functor, argument and subcategorization. Unfortunately, neither of them has sufficiently dealt with .the syntactic structure of a coordination especially when a coordinator (such as and, or and comma) has two or possibly more preceding and succeeding constituents.","We in this paper propose a method for determining the structure of a coordinate construction using information on similarities, selectional restrictions, and oilier linguistic cues. In Section 2 we identify the problem and describe the ideas behind our method in Section 3. We give disambiguation algorithms, show an disambiguation experiment, and evaluate its results in Section 4. In Section 5 we suggest an applicability of our method to resolving other syntactic ambiguities."]},{"title":"2 Modification Relation in Coordination","paragraphs":["Resolving ambiguities in a coordinate construction is to determine the way of conjoining constituents (words, phrases, or clauses) and/or to determine the scope of coordination, i.e., immediacy relations among the constituents involved. For instance, in sweet and sour pork, the right immediacy relation is ((sweet and sour) pork) rather than (sweet and (sour pork)).","Consider other examples. (1) Tom is a ((stock and estate) keeper). (2) John is a (student and (chess player)). (3) Old men and women were left at the village.","In each of these sentences, a noun or an adjective that appears in the left hand side of coordinator(s) has two (or more) modificant candidates: it may or may not modify the head noun in the right hand side."]},{"title":"263","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 263-270 In (1), stock and estate should be conjoined to modify keeper. In (2), there is not a modification relation between student and player and its interpretation should be (student and (chess player)). We are able to make unique interpretation for (1) and (2), but we may have two interpretations for (3). (3a) Women are left at the village and old men were left at the village. (3b) Old men were left at the village and old women were left at the village.","Later in the paper, we try to resolve the ambiguities by determining the modification relation in the coordinate constructions (CCs) such as in (1) to (3)."]},{"title":"3 Identifying Modification Relation in Coordination","paragraphs":["We have found through linguistic observations that a variety of information supplies important cues for disambiguation. Some of them are computable and effectively used in a computer model of disambiguation. The ones we thought most important include: similarities in syntactic forms and/or meanings, selectional restrictions, and orthographic forms. 3.1 Linguistic Observations Similarities in Syntactic Forms and Meanings We see that similarities on forms and meanings are crucial to determine the structure of a coordinate construction.","If the modifier is not an adjective, for instance, it is likely that two constituents before and after the coordinator are conjoined when they belong to the same subcategory and match in number: (4) ((business and management) sections) (5) (businesses and (culture activities))","In the following examples, (6) ((research and development) section) (7) (researcher and (system engineer)) it is obvious that the research and development have more in common in meaning than research and section, and that researcher and engineer are semantically more similar than researcher and system. Likewise, we see:","(8) (lovely (cats and dogs)) *((lovely cats ) and dogs) Selectional Restrictions Consider the sentence: (9) Peter likes ((green vegetables) and (music)). we know in (9) that green as a color can be used to modify concrete entities like vegetables, but not abstract one like music. This means that selectional restriction (SR), a semantic restriction imposed on lexical items when forming a sentence, is an important factor to determining the structure of coordinate constructions. In this paper, we discuss SR in the context of adj+nl+and+n2 and its extension (e.g., adj n 1 ,\\tnk)2. Other Linguistic Cues Orthographic forms often play an important role in disambiguating the structures of coordinate constructions. It is likely that all nouns can be conjoined when they are in capital forms. An example: (10) ((Research and Development) Section) When the conjoined nouns in a coordinate structure are preceded by a determiner, the usual 1 In this case, the coordination of stock and estate keeper is considered to be the reduced form of stock keeper and estate keeper. 2Hereafter, and in adj+nl+and+n2 and in nl±and-f-n2+n3 represents a coordinator such as and, or, comma, and the like."]},{"title":"264","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 263-270 interpretation is that the determiner applies to the conjoins: (11) Old men and women were left to organize the community. The structure (old (men and women)) is more likely than ((old men) and women) because there is a tendency that the determiner is not repeated in the noninitial conjoins, e.g., the (man and women)(Quirk et al. 1985). 3.2 Computational Measurements of Similarities Semantic similarity has been measured in a number of ways (e.g., Resnik 1993; Kozima and Furugori, 1993; Dagan et al., 1994). Many researchers opt to investigate methods for deriving measures of semantic similarity among words based on distributional behavior observed in corpora or machine-readable dictionaries. We however employ a hybrid method for combining the quantitative method with an existing broad-coverage source of lexical knowledge.","To capture the similarity between two words in context, we consider two kinds of semantic relations useful and effective: taxonomic relation and co-occurrence relation.","Computationally, one way of measuring semantic similarity is to use the taxonomic relations in the WordNet (Miller, 1990), a widely used lexical database including four kinds of semantic relationships in a word sense network: synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and antonymy. We found that the antonymy relationship appears often in CCs (e.g., brother and sister, man and woman, and boy and girl) and shows a strong tie between two nouns in the coordinate structure like (14). (12) (cheerful (boys and girls))","Another way of measuring semantic similarity is to use the mutual information(MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990). It may be taken from the co-occurrence relations using two corpora: the EDR English Corpus and Brown Corpus'. We define the similarity between two words w 1 and w2 when appearing with an adjacent word w. In an example, (13) new books and hamburgers where w i , w2 , and w are book, hamburger and new, respectively. We can measure two similarities, the left side similarity and right side similarity. w comes to the left of w1 and w2 in the former like young in (14) and it comes to the right side of w1 and w2 in' the latter like investigation in (15). (14) young nations and superpowers (15) finance and market investigation The left side similarity and the right side similarity are defined as: simi,"]},{"title":"(W","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":"W","paragraphs":["27 W) max(I(w, wi),/(w,w2)) ming(wi , w), I(w2 , w))"]},{"title":"SiMR (W1 ' W2 ' W)","paragraphs":["max(I(wi ,w), Aw2,w)) Here, for two words x and y, I(x,y) is MI between x and y, where x is on the left side of y, and I(y,x) is MI between y and x, where x is on the right side of y.","If w appears in either side of w1 , or in either side of w 2 , we can define two-sided similarity as: SiML (W1, W2, W)"]},{"title":"SiM","paragraphs":["R("]},{"title":"wi, w","paragraphs":["2, w) sim(wi ,"]},{"title":"W","paragraphs":["27 W)\\t 2 Here, w may be a verb, a noun, an adjective, or a phrase like agree with."]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["EDR English Corpus, compiled by Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, Ltd., contains 160,000 sentences with annotated morphological, syntactic and semantic information.

This problem is known as the sparse data problem. There are a number of methods for dealing with this problem (e.g., Resnik, 1993; Dagan et al., 1995). Our solution in this paper is to use a synonym set (S) in the WordNet to substituting for the sparse word w. The above formulae in this case becomes: simL(wi, w2 , w ) = simR(wi, w2, w) = EcES min(I (c,w1 ), -4;11)2)) EcES max(I(c, w1 ),\\tw2)) EcES min(gwi ' c), i(w2 ' c)) EcEs max(I(wl ' c), 1(w2 ' c)) (4) (5) here c stands for a synonym set related to the word w.","wi and w2 may be replaced by their synonym sets S1 and S2 in the WordNet.

Each of them denotes a maximum similarity between synonyms of w 1 and synonyms of w2 with synonyms of w. 3.3 Selectional Restrictions as Constraints Selectional restrictions(SRs) are often defined on an empirical basis using AI(artificial intelligence) techniques. Recently serveral research efforts have turned to corpus-based methods to define and acquire them. Along the line, we search a new approach for finding SRs using on-line corpora and a lexical database.","We view SR as negative information, a constraint between two words. The information on Sits may be computed from corpora: for a particular adjective and a particular noun, we try to find 'similar' words and then check if they co-occur in the corpora. If no co-occurrences are observed in the corpora, we assume that there is a SR between the adjective and the noun.","A problem we encounter here is how to find 'similar' words. It has been proven by an experiment that similar words generated by corpus-based clustering methods does not work well (Grefenstette 1993). We choose to acquire similar words from a taxonomy (the WordNet).","It seems to be reasonable for a noun to use its direct hypernym (father node in IS-A hierarchy in the WordNet) and hyponyms of the hypernym (the siblings of the noun) as similar words. But it does not work for an adjective. A compromising measure for an adjective is to use synonyms rather than hypernyms as similar words, e.g., {pure,unmixed,undiluted} for pure.","Thus, if n2 or its similar words co-occur adj or its synonyms (in the WordNet) in the corpora (the EDR English corpus and the Brown corpus), we may conclude that the CC has the structure (adj (n1 and n2)). Otherwise, it would be ((adj n1) and n2) as there is a SR between adj and n2. Take (16) for an example, (16) ((Fresh air) and sunshine) bring me health and feelings of joy. We are sure that fresh air and sunshine has the structure ((fresh air) and sunshine) as no co-occurrence between the synonyms of fresh and the similar words of sunshine is found."]},{"title":"4 Disambiguation for Structure of Coordinate Constructions","paragraphs":["We have devised disambiguation algorithms based on what we have described in section 3.

Experimental Results To evaluate the performance of the disambiguation algorithm, we randomly selected two sets of 300 coordinate structures of the form adj+nl+and+n2 and nl+and+n2+n3 from on-line CNN news using the method proposed by Mela and Fouquere (1996) and ran the algorithms on a computer.","The result for disambiguating CCs of adj+nl+and+n2 is shown in Table 1 and that for nl+and+n2+n3 in Table 2.

Suppose n2 is similar to n4, we then check whether n1 co-occurs with n3 in pattern n1 n3 in the corpora, if the answer is yes, then produce (n1 (n2 and (n3 n4)) n5), otherwise produce (((n1 n2) and (n3 n4)) n5). Using this method, the analysis for CC freshman training and personal management system is (((freshmen training) and (personal menagement)) system); while for food handling and storage procedure the result turns to be ((food (handling and storage)) procedure).","The method can also be applied to analyzing structures of nominal compounds. Take the phrase novice song bird feeder kit, for instance. Selectional restriction may play an important role in judging which constituent the adjective novice refers to in the candidates song, bird, feeder, kit and their combinations. Co-occurrence relation, on the other hand, is crucial to determining the structure of a nominal compound like song bird feeder. We may collect statistics to see if song bird is observed more often than song feeder. Conclusion Resolving ambiguities in coordinate structure has a great importance for its applications to text understanding and machine translation. It is crucial to information retrieval, too (e.g., internet information retrieval). Given \"training system\" as a conjoined retrieval condition, for example, the phrase freshman training and personal management system in the target text can be retrieved using the method presented in this paper, but it can hardly be found with the retrieval techniques available so far.","The disambiguation method proposed is scalable since it does not depend on any handcrafted rules. It is strong at the data sparseness problem also as we use co-occurrences between semantic classes, rather than words, extracted from a lexical database.","The disambiguation experiment has proven that our method for disambiguating syntactic structures is valid, effective, and useful in practical applications. The performance of our method is significantly better than those of other work. We think that the performance can be improved further by using a larger corpus that contributes to the precision for estimating semantic similarities and/or selectional restrictions.
