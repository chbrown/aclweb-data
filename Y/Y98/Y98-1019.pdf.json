It is implemented by the concept of trigger pair, which is selected by average mutual information and measured by mutual information. Both the distance-independent(DI) and distance-dependent(DD) MI-Trigger-based models are constructed within a window of a size from 1 to 10. It is found that the DD MI-Trigger models have better performance than the DI MI-Trigger models for the same window size and it is better to model the preferred relationships in a distance-dependent way. It is also found that the number of the trigger pairs in an MI-Trigger model can be kept to a reasonable size without losing too much of its modeling power. Finally, it is concluded that the preferred relationships between words are useful to language disambiguation and can be modeled efficiently by the MI-Trigger-based modeling approach."]},{"title":"Keyword:","paragraphs":["MI-Trigger modeling approach, preferred relationship, long-distance context dependency, average mutual information, mutual information."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In natural language there always exist many preferred relationships between words. Lexicographers always use the concepts of collocation, co-occurrence and lexis to describe them. One classic example is \"strong\" and \"powerful\". [Halliday66] noticed that these two words were used in different language environments such as \"strong tea\" and \"powerful computer\" although they had similar syntax and semantics. Psychologists also have a similar concept: word association. Two highly associated word pairs are \"bread/butter\" and \"doctor/nurse\". Psychological experiments in [Meyer+75] indicated that the human' s reaction to a highly associated word pair was stronger and faster than that to a poorly associated word pair.","The strength of word association can be measured by mutual information. By computing mutual information between the two words in the word pair, we can get many useful preference information from the corpus, such as the semantic preference between noun and noun(e.g. \"doctor/nurse\"), the particular preference between adjective and noun(e.g. \"strong/tea\"), and solid structure(e.g. \"the more/the more\"). These information are useful for automatic sentence disambiguation. The research in [Hindle+93] showed the role of correlated statistical information in resolving the sentence","ambiguity. Consider a simple English sentence:","\"She (wanted I placed I put) the dress on the rack.\"","For different verbs, the linking directions of the preposition phrase(\" on the rack\") are different. It can modify the noun(for \"wanted\") or function as the objective complement of the verbs(for \"placed \" and \"put\"). This is the well-known preposition phrase(PP) attachment problem in the analysis of English. Their research showed that a reasonable analysis result can be chosen by comparing the mutual information of the verb-preposition pair(\"want/on\") and • the object-preposition pair(\"dress/on\"). [Magerman+90] used a computational model of mutual information to automatically segment short phrases. [Rosenfeld94] used the concept of trigger pair as the basic information bearing element to extract information from further back in the document's history. Similar research includes [Brent93] and [Kobayashi+94]."]},{"title":"195","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 195-205","In Chinese, a word is made up of one or more characters. Hence, there also exists preferred relationships between Chinese characters. [Sproat+90] employed a statistical method to group neighboring Chinese characters in a sentence into two-character words by making use of a measure of character association based on mutual information. Here, we will focus instead on the preferred relationships between words.","The preference relationships between words can expand from a short distance to a long distance. While N-gram models are simple in language modeling and have been successfully used in speech recognition and other tasks, they have obvious deficiencies. For instance, N-gram models can only capture the short-distance dependency within an N-word window where currently the largest practical N for natural language is three and many kinds of dependencies in natural language occur beyond a three-word window. While we can use conventional N-gram models to capture the short-distance dependency, the long-distance dependency should also be exploited properly.","The purpose of this paper is to study the preferred relationships between words over a short or long distance and propose a new modeling approach to capture such phenomena in the Chinese language.","The organization of this chapter is as follows: Section 2 defines the concept of trigger pair. The criteria of how to select a trigger pair are described in Section 3 while Section 4 describes a method to measure the strength of a trigger pair.

It is important that enough data should be used relative to the number of parameters in the model so that the model is not grossly over-fitted.
