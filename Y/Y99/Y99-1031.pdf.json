However, for translation of conversation, correct translation rates and quality of translation are particularly low. This is due to machine translation systems not being able to generate translation results which fit the context of the conversation . We previously proposed a method of Machine Translation Using Inductive Learning with Genetic Algorithms(GA-ILMT). We compare this system's results to two others that use rule-based translation method, and evaluate the results of experiments done with GA-ILMT, measuring it's performance when applied to travel English. As a result of the evaluation experiments, we confirmed that GA-ILMT can generate translation results which are more appropriate to the context of the conversation."]},{"title":"1 INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Recently, the internet has come to be used by many people around the world. As a result, it is necessary to communicate correctly and quickly, information that is expressed in different languages. Machine translation is a very effective method of responding this need. Therefore, substantial research has been carried out in the machine translation field, and many machine translation systems have been developed. However, their correct translation rates and quality of translation are not sufficient to date. In the translation of conversation, the correct translation rate and the quality of translation are particularly low. This is due to machine translation systems not being able to generate translation results which fit the context of the conversation. Machine translation systems must be able to translate well to generate translation results which will also fit the context of the conversation taking place..","To date, machine translation systems have been rule-based machine translation[1]. However, this method has several problems. Rule-based machine translation cannot deal adequately with various linguistic phenomena due to its use of limited rules. Moreover, it also has difficulty in dealing with words that it does not recognize due to the use of it's non-dynamic dictionary. It is difficult for the rule-based machine translation method to translate conversational sentences which have a certain context. To resolve these problems, an example-based machine translation method is being researched [2, 3, 4]. This method can improve the correct translation rate and the quality of translation by incorporating any new translation examples that it is given. It becomes possible to translate conversational sentences through having many translation examples. However, serious obstacles remain before the realization of a practical translation system, as the example-based machine translation method requires both a large base of translation examples and a lot of CPU time. As a result, it is difficult to produce a machine translation system based on this method. -285-Source Sentence Translation Process Translation Result \\t (Proofreading) - Proofread Translation Result I Feedback Process","Dictionary for Translation Rules .1 Learning Process","We previously proposed a method of Machine Translation Using Inductive Learning with Genetic Algorithms toward the realization of a practical machine translation system. We call this method GA-ILMT. In GA-ILMT, translation rules are inductively acquired from only translation examples. Thereafter, many translation rules which apply to specific fields are acquired. Translation results are then generated by using these translation rules. As a result, GA-ILMT can improve the correct translation rate and the quality of translation by incorporating new translation examples. Moreover, a greater variation of translation examples is generated from the initial small number of translation examples, by applying genetic algorithms[6] to machine translation using inductive learning.","Our research goal is to design a computer system with the same capability of language and knowledge acquisition as found in human beings [7]. We believe that GA-ILMT can imitate the learning process which human beings have. GA-ILMT can generate variety translation examples because it uses only given translation examples without any analytical knowledge. For example, the system automatically generate the translation example \"He likes tennis.\" ; Kare wa tenisu ga suki desu. 1 \" by replacing the word \"tea; ocha\" in the given translation example \"He likes tea.;Kare wa ocha ga suki desu.\" with the word \"tennis;tenisu.\" This process corresponds to the process in which a little child replaces words in sentences with other words.","hi order to show the practical effectiveness of GA-ILMT, we performed experiments that give a practical evaluation of GA-ILMT. We used translation examples of travel conversations[8]. In the experiments, we used travel conversations as data to confirm that GA-ILMT can generate translation results which fit the context of the conversation. These results showed that GA-ILMT is a more practical machine translation system than machine translation systems that are rule-based machine translations. However, consideration of the experiment's results was still not sufficient. Therefore, we performed further experiments using more data, evaluating the effectiveness of GA-ILMT in more detail. In this paper, we describe the consideration of these experiment's results in detail. Moreover, we confirm GA-ILMT can generate translation results which fit a certain context, and can adapt to various filed data through its learning capability. 1.1 Outline of the GA-ILMT Figure 1: Outline of GA-ILMT 1 Japanese words are written in italics","GA-ILMT can translate many different languages by simply changing to the language of the translation examples, as this method aims to acquire translation rules from character strings in each of the languages it is translating. Figure 1 shows the outline of GA-ILMT.","First, in the case of English-to-Japanese, the user inputs a source sentence in English. Second, in the translation process, the system generates several candidates as translation results using translation rules extracted from the learning process. Third, the user proofreads the translated sentences if they include any errors. Fourth, in the feedback process, the system determines the fitness value of translation rules used in the translation process and performs a selection process removing erroneous translation rules. In the learning process, new translation examples are automatically produced through crossover and mutation, and various translation rules are acquired from the translation examples through inductive learning. Repetition of the abovementioned process is the equivalent of generation replacement within the system, thus the system is continuously evolving to a higher-quality translation system.","In the feedback process, the system evaluates the translation results using translated sentences which have been proofread. The system determines the fitness value of the translation rules used in the translation process through the use of correct and erroneous translation frequencies. The fitness value is calculated by the fitness function as follows: Fitness value(%) = The correct translation frequency x 100\\t(1)","The number of uses The system performs the selection process using the fitness value.","(1)Selection form, giving translation examples ENGLISH\\tJAPANESE (He likes tennis .;Kare wa tenisu ga suki desu .)

Figure 2: Example of one-point crossover","In the learning process, new translation examples are automatically generated through crossover and mutation. In crossover, two translation examples which have common parts are selected, the crossover position occurring at the common part. Crossover uses the common parts from the English and Japanese sentences for translation examples. Figure 2 shows examples of a one-point crossover. In Figure 2, \"likes\" is the common part of the two English sentences, and \" wa\" and \"ga suki desu\" are the common parts of the two Japanese sentences. Therefore, \"likes\" and \"wa\" are the crossover positions. New translation examples are generated using the one-point crossover. Next, one-point crossover is performed for \"likes\" and \"ga suki desu\". However, the generated translation examples have the same character strings as the source sentences. Therefore, these translation examples are not input into the dictionary. The system extracts the common and (3)One-point crossover of Japanese sentence Kare wa Kanojyo wa -287-","Table 1: The number of source sentences and the average number of words per source sentence.

This process also uses genetic algorithm. The system substitutes words using word translation rules, for the variables in the sentence translation rules. The system can generate the Japanese sentence for the English sentence when the English sentence has the same character string as the source sentence. The Japanese sentence generated is the translation result. When there are several translation results, the system selects the correct translation result according to two criteria: the one that uses the translation rule more similar to the source sentence, and the one that uses the translation rule with a higher fitness value."]},{"title":"2 EXPERIMENTS","paragraphs":["We evaluated the performance of GA-ILMT using translation examples from travel conversations in four different scenes \"on the plane\", \"at the airport\", \"on the check-in\" and \"on the telephone\". We call \"on the plane\" Scene 1, \"at the airport\" Scene 2, \"on the check-in\" Scene 3 and \"on the telephone\" Scene 4, respectively. 2.1 Data","Table 1 shows the number of source sentences and the average number of words in each source sentence. These source sentences were taken from 10 English travel books written for Japanese people. These books are [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. We call these books No.1, No.2, \\t, No.10, respectively. 2.2 Procedure","We used two other machine translation systems, comparing them with the GA-ILMT. We call these two machine translation systems A and 13, respectively. We performed four experiments for data of Scenel, Scene 2, Scene 3 and Scene 4. The initial dictionary of GA-ILMT was empty for each experiment. In the learning process, one-point crossover and two-point crossover were used, and the translation examples were randomly changed by mutation at a rate of 2.0%. In the selection process, the number of uses would be over five and the fitness value would be under 25.0%. The thresholds were determined by a preliminary experiment. The experiment's procedure is shown in Figure 1.","In GA-ILMT, the correct translation rate and the quality of translation may change when the sequence of text books because GA-ILMT is a machine translation method which has learning capability.

However, the changes in correct translation rates are different as shown in Figure 3. The reason for this is that GA-ILMT is a machine translation method based on learning capability. GA-ILMT needs a number of translation examples to acquire translation rules in order to begin learning. Therefore, correct translation rates at the beginning of the learning process are low. In Figure 3, the correct translation rates for GA-ILMT in the first half are generally lower than B. However, the correct translation rates for GA-ILMT in the second half are higher than A and B.","Table 3 shows the number of correct translation results which are generated when combining translation rules from the first half to the second half, respectively. In Table 3, there are few translation results generated by combining the translation rules of the first half. However, in the second half, the number of correct translation results generated by combining extracted translation rules increases. These results show that GA-ILMT has a higher learning capability. In experiments # and y using GA-ILMT, the same evaluation results are achieved. 2.5.2 Quality of translation","The evaluation experiments show that GA-ILMT is a machine translation system which can perform a contextual translation through learning capability.

Therefore, the translation result of GA-ILMT is a more natural sentence. This shows that GA-ILMT can generate a translation result which better fits the context of a sentence.

The system uses given translation examples and generates a greater variety of translation examples using it's learning capability. Through this process, the system does not use any analytical knowledge like grammatical rules. As a result, system based on GA-ILMT can generate translation rules which better fit the context of translatable subjects.

System based on GA-ILMT is a more practical machine translation system than the systems based on rule-based machine translation for travel conversation. Moreover, we confirmed that GA-ILMT can improve the correct translation rate because it has learning capability.","In GA-ILMT, the translation examples and translation rules are generated using only given translation examples without any analytical knowledge. As a result, GA-ILMT can generate translation results which better fit the context of translatable subjects. It is difficult for rule-based machine translation to generate translation results which fit the context. The reason being that rule-based machine translation needs too much knowledge to generate translation results which fit the context. Also, in GA-ILMT, the generation process corresponds to the process where a little child acquires a lot of knowledge by changing words in given sentences.
