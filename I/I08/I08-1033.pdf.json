There have been many statistical word alignment methods proposed since the IBM models have been introduced. Most existing methods treat word tokens as basic alignment units (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Deng and Byrne, 2005), however, many languages have no explicit word boundary markers, such as Chinese and Japanese. In these languages, word segmentation (Chen and Liu, 1992; Chen and Bai, 1998; Chen and Ma, 2002; Ma and Chen, 2003; Gao et al., 2005) is often carried out firstly to identify words before word alignment (Wu and Xia, 1994). However, the differences in lexicalization may degrade word alignment performance, for different languages may realize the same concept using different numbers of words (Ma et al., 2007; Wu, 1997). For instance, Chinese multi-syllabic words composed of more than one meaningful morpheme which may be translated to several English words. For example, the Chinese word 教育署 is composed of two meaning units, 教育 and 署, and is translated to Department of Education in English. The morphemes 教育 and 署 have their own meanings and are translated to Education and Department respectively. The phenomenon of lexicalization mismatch will degrade the performance of word alignment for several reasons. The first reason is that it will reduce the cooccurrence counts of Chinese and English tokens. Consider the previous example. Since 教育署 is treated as a single unit, it does not contribute to the occurrence counts of Education/ 教育 and Department/署 token pairs. Secondly, the rarely occurring compound word may cause the garbage collectors effect (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006), aligning a rare word in source language to too many words in the target language, due to the frequency imbalance with the corresponding translation words in English (Lee, 2004). Finally, the IBM models (Moore, 2004) impose the limitation that each word in the target sentence can be generated by at most one word in the source sentence. In this case, a many-to-one alignment, links a phrase in the source sentence to a single token in the target sentence, is not allowed, forcing most links of a phrase in the source sentence to be abolished. As in the previous example, when aligning from English to Chinese, 教育署 can only be linked to one of the English words, say Education, because of the limitation of the IBM model. However for remedy, many of the current word alignment methods combine the results of both alignment directions, via intersection or"]},{"title":"249","paragraphs":["grow-diag-final heuristic, to improve the alignment reliability (Koehn et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2006; Ayan et al., 2006; DeNero et al., 2007). However the many-to-one link limitation will undermine the reliability due to the fact that some links are not allowed in one of the directions.","In this paper, we propose two novel methods to adjust word segmentation so as to decrease the effect of lexicalization differences to improve word alignment performance. The main idea of our methods is to adjust Chinese word segmentation according to their translation derived from parallel sentences in order to make the tokens compatible to 1-to-1 mapping between the corresponding sentences. The first method is based on learning a set of affix rules from bilingual terminology bank, and adjusting the segmentation according to these affix rules when preprocessing the Chinese part of the parallel corpus. The second method is based on the so-called impurity measure, which was motivated by the decision tree (Duda et al., 2001).",""]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["Our methods are motivated by the translation-driven segmentation method proposed by Wu (1997) to segment words in a way to improve word alignment. However, Wu's method needs a translation lexicon to filter out the links which were not in the lexicon and the result was only evaluated on the sentence pairs which were covered by the lexicon.","A word packing method has been proposed by Ma et al. (2007) to improve the word alignment task. Before carrying out word alignment, this method packs several consecutive words together when those words believed to correspond to a single word in the other language. Our basic idea is similar to this, but on the contrary, we try to unpack words which are translations of several words in the other language. Since the word packing method treats the packed consecutive words as a single token, as we mentioned in the previous section, it weakens the association strength of translation pairs of their morphemes while applying the IBM word alignment model.","A lot of morphological analysis methods have been proposed to improve the performance of word alignment for inflectional language (Lee et al., 2003; Lee, 2004; Goldwater, 2005). They proposed to split a word into a morpheme sequence of the pattern prefix*-stem-suffix* (* denotes zero or more occurrences of a morpheme). Their experiments showed that morphological analysis can improve the quality of machine translation by reducing data sparseness and by making the tokens in two languages correspond more 1-to-1. However, these segmentation methods were developed from the monolingual perspective."]},{"title":"3 Adjusting Word Segmentation","paragraphs":["The goal of word segmentation adjustment is to adjust the segmentation of Chinese words such that we have as many 1-to-1 links to the English words as possible. In this task, we will face the problem of finding the proper morpheme boundaries for Chinese words. The challenge is that almost all characters of Chinese are morphemes and therefore almost every character boundary in a word could be the boundary of a morpheme, there is no simple rules to find the suitable boundaries of morphemes. Furthermore, not all meaningful morphemes need to be segmented to meet the requirement of 1-to-1 mapping. For example, washing machine/洗衣機 can be segmented into 洗衣 and 機 corresponding to washing and machine while heater/暖氣機 does not need, it depends on their translations.","In this paper, we have proposed two different methods to solve this problem: 1. learning affix rules from terminology bank to segment morphemes and 2. using impurity measure to finding the morpheme boundaries. The detail of these methods will be described in the following sections."]},{"title":"4 Affix Rule Method","paragraphs":["The main idea of this method is to segment a Chinese word according to some properly designed conditional dependent affix rules. As shown in Figure 1, each rule is composed of three conditional constraints, a) affix condition, b) English word condition and c) exception condition. In the affix condition, we place a underscore on the left of a morpheme, such as _機, to denote a suffix and on the right, such as 副_, to denote a prefix. The affix rules are applied to each word by checking the following three conditions:","1. The target word has the affix."]},{"title":"250","paragraphs":["2.

Then we extracted affix rules from the word-to-morpheme alignment results of terms and translation."," 4.2 Word-to-Morpheme Alignment The training phase of word-to-morpheme alignment is based loosely on word-to-word alignment of the IBM model 1. Instead of using Chinese words, we considered all the possible morphemes. For example, consider the task of aligning Department of Education and 教育署 as  1 The bilingual terminology bank was compiled by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation. It is freely download at http://terms.nict.gov.tw by registering your information. shown as Figure 2. We use the EM algorithm to train the translation probabilities of word-morpheme pairs based on IBM model 1.","  Figure 2. Example of word-to-morpheme alignment.","","In the aligning phase, the original IBM model 1 does not work properly as we expected. Because the English words prefer to link to single character and it results that some correct Chinese translations will not be linked. The reason is that the probability of a morpheme, say p(教育|education), is always less than its substring, p(教|education), since whatever 教育 occurs 教 and 育 always occur but not vice versa. So the aligning result will be 教 /Education and 署 /Department, 育 is abandoned. To overcome this problem, a constraint of alignment is imposed to the model to ensure that the aligning result covers every Chinese characters of a target word and no overlapped characters in the result morpheme sequence. For instances, both 教 /Education 署 /Department and 教育 /Education 育署/Department are not allowed alignment sequences. The constraint is applied to each possible aligning result. If the alignment violates the constraint, it will be rejected.","Since the new alignment algorithm must enumerate all of the possible alignments, the process is very time consuming. Therefore, it is advantageous to use a bilingual terminology bank rather than a parallel corpus. The average length of terminologies is short and much shorter than a typical sentence in a parallel corpus. This makes words to morphemes alignment computationally feasible and the results highly accurate (Chang et al., 2001; Bai et al., 2006). This makes it possible to use the result as pseudo gold standards to evaluate affix rules as described in section 4.3.","","","",""]},{"title":"251 ","paragraphs":["air|空氣 refrigeration|冷凍 machine|機 building|建築 industry|業 compound|複式 steam|蒸汽 engine|機 electronics|電子 industry|業 vice|副 chancellor|校長 Figure 3. Sample of word-to-morpheme alignment. 4.3 Rule Extraction After the alignment task, we will get a word-to-morpheme aligned terminology bank as shown in Figure 3. We can subsequently extract affix rules from the aligned terminology bank by the following steps:  1) Generate candidates of affix rule: For each alignment, we produce all alignment links as affix rules. For instance, with (electronics| 電子 industry| 業 ), we would produce two rules:","","(a) 電子_, electronics","(b) _業, industry","","2) Evaluate the rules: The precision of each candidate rule is estimated by applying the rule to segment the Chinese terms. If a Chinese term contains the affix shown in the rule, the affix will be segmented. The results of segmentation are then to compare with the segmentation results of the alignments done by the algorithm of the section 4.2 as pseudo gold standards.

And then for each Ri , we scan R1 to Ri-1, if there is a rule, Rj, have the same English word condition and the affix condition of Ri subsume that of Rj, then we add affix condition of Rj as exception condition of Ri. For example, _業, industry and _工業, industry are rule candidates in the sorted table and have the same English word condition. Furthermore, the condition _ 業 subsumes that of 工業, we add 工業 to the exception condition of the rule with a shorter affix.","","4) Reevaluate the rules with exception","condition: After adding the exception conditions, the rules are reevaluated with considering the exception condition to get new evaluation scores.","","5) Select rules by scores: Finally, filter out the rules with scores lower than a threshold2",".","","The reason of using exception condition is that an affix is usually an abbreviation of a word, such as _業 is an abbreviation of 工業. In general, a full morpheme is preferred to be segmented than its abbreviation while both occurred in a target word. For example, when applying rules to 電子工業 /electronic industry, _ 工業,industry is preferred than _業,industry. However, in the evaluation step, precision rate of _業,industry will be reduced when applying to full morphemes, such as 電子工業 /electronic industry, and then could be filtered out if the precision is lower than the threshold."]},{"title":"5 Impurity Measure Method","paragraphs":["The impurity measure was used by decision tree (Duda et al., 2001) to split the training examples into smaller and smaller subsets progressively according to features and hope that all the samples in each subset is as pure as possible.

Therefore we investigate the actual distribution of target words first, we have tagged 1,573 Chinese words manually with target and non-target. It turns out that only 6.87% of the Chinese words are tagged as target and 94.4% of target words are nouns. The results show that most of the Chinese words do not need to be re-segmented and their POS distribution is very unbalanced. The results show that we can filter out the non-target words by simple clues.
