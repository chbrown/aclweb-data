There is not enough POS tagged corpus available in Manipuri language ruling out machine learning approaches for a POS tagger in the language. A morphology driven Manipuri POS tagger that uses three dictionaries containing root words, prefixes and suffixes has been designed and implemented using the affix information irrespective of the context of the words. We have tested the current POS tagger on 3784 sentences containing 10917 unique words. The POS tagger demonstrated an accuracy of 69%. Among the incorrectly tagged 31% words, 23% were unknown words (includes 9% named entities) and 8% known words were wrongly tagged. "]},{"title":"1 Introduction ","paragraphs":["Manipuri (Meiteilon or Meiteiron) belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family and is highly agglutinative in behavior, monosyllabic, influenced and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of Sanskrit origin and English. The affixes play the most important role in the structure of the language. A clear -cut demarcation between morphology and syntax is not possible. In Manipuri, words are formed in three processes called affixation, derivation and compounding (Thoudam, 2006). The majority of the roots found in the language are bound and the affixes are the determining factor of the class of the words in the language. Classification of words using the role of affix helps to implement the tagger for a resource poor language like Manipuri with high performance.","There are many POS taggers developed using different techniques for many major languages such as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), Markov model (Cutting et al., 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English. Decision trees are used to estimate marginal probabilities in a maximum entropy model for predicting the parts-of-speech of a word given the context in which it appears (Black et al., 1992). The rules in a rule-based system are usually difficult to construct and typically are not very robust (Brill, 1992). Large tables of statistics are not needed for the rule-based tagger. In a stochastic tagger, tens of thousands of lines of statistical information are needed to capture the contextual information (Brill, 1992). For a tagger to function as a practical component in a language processing system, a tagger must be robust, efficient, accurate, tunable and reusable (Cutting, 1992). "]},{"title":"2 Previous work on Manipuri POS tagger ","paragraphs":["Morphology based POS tagging of some languages like Turkish (Oflazer and Kuruoz, 1994), Czech (Hajic, et al., 2001) has been tried out using a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical learning. A Marathi rule based POS tagger used a technique called SRR (suffix replacement rule) (Burange et al., 2006) with considerable accuracy. A POS tagger for Hindi overcomes the handicap of annotated corpora scarcity by exploiting the rich morphology of the language (Singh et al., 2006). To the best of our knowledge, there is no record available of work done on a Manipuri POS tagger. A related work of word class and sentence type identification in a Manipuri Morphological Analyzer 91 is found in (Thoudam and Bandyopadhyay, 2006) where the classification of few word categories and sentence type identification are discussed based on affix rules.",""]},{"title":"3 Manipuri Morphemes ","paragraphs":["There are free and bound roots in Manipuri. All the verb roots are bound roots. There are also a few bound noun roots, the interrogative and demonstrative pronoun roots. They cannot occur without some particle prefixed or suffixed to it. The bound root may form a compound by the addition of another root. The free roots are pure nouns, pronouns, time adverbials and some numerals. The bound roots are mostly verb roots although there are a few noun and other roots. The suffixes, which are attached to the nouns, derived nouns, to the adjectives in noun phrases including numerals, the case markers and the bound coordinators are the nominal suffixes. In Manipuri, the nominal suffixes are always attached to the numeral in a noun phrase and the noun cannot take the suffixes. Since numerals are considered as adjectives, the position occupied by the numerals in Manipuri may be regarded adjective position (Thoudam, 2006). There are a few prefixes in Manipuri. These prefixes are mostly attached to the verb roots. They can also be attached to the derived nouns and bound noun roots. There are also a few prefixes derived from the personal pronouns.","In this agglutinative language the numbers of verbal suffixes are more than that of the nominal suffixes (Singh, 2000). New words are easily formed in Manipuri using morphological rules. Inflectional morphology is more productive than derivative morphology (Chelliah, 1997). There are 8 inflectional (INFL) suffixes and 23 enclitics (ENC). There are 5 derivational prefixes out of which 2 are category changing and 3 are non-category changing. There are 31 non-category changing derivational suffixes and 2 category changing suffixes. The non-category changing derivational suffixes may be divided into first level derivatives (1","st","LD) of 8 suffixes, second level derivatives (2nd","LD) of 16 suffixes and third level derivatives (3rd","LD) of 7 suffixes. Enclitics in Manipuri fall in six categories: determiners, case markers, the copula, mood markers, inclusive/exclusive and pragmatic peak markers and attitude markers. The categories are determined on the basis of position in the word (category 1 occurs before category 2, category 2 occurs before category 3 and so on). "]},{"title":"4 Dictionaries ","paragraphs":["Three different dictionaries namely prefix which contains prefix information, suffix which contains suffix information and root containing 2051 entries are used for the system.

The bilingual parallel dictionary is used for testing POS tagger and later on will be used for EBMT system. The Manipuri sentences/phrases using a particular word are used as the input to the POS tagger thus enabling to sort out words with multiple meaning. "]},{"title":"5 Morphological analysis of Major Lexical categories ","paragraphs":["The lexical categories in Manipuri can be of two types – major and minor (Chelliah, 1997). Major lexical categories can be of two types, namely “actual” and “potential”. The lexicon of actual lexical categories i.e., actual lexicon consists of an unordered list of roots and affixes and lexicalized forms. Each lexical entry in the actual lexicon consists of what lexical category it belongs to and what its meaning is. On the other hand, the output of the potential lexicon consists of words created through productive morphological processes. In the actual lexicon, roots may be bound or free. Nouns and verbs from the actual lexicon can be distinguished on formal grounds in that bound roots are verbs and free roots are nouns. In the potential lexicon, adjectives, adverbs and nominal forms can be derived from verb roots and stative verbs can be derived from noun roots. There are several instances where the words belonging to some class or category plays the role of some other category sometimes based on its position in the sentences (P.C. Thoudam, 92 2006) Some of the generalized handcrafted rules to identify the lexical are given as below.  5.1 Nouns  Nouns can be distinguished from other lexical categories on morphological grounds. Unlike verbs, nouns can be suffixed by gender, number or case markers.

Another problem is to classify basic root forms according to word class although the distinction between the noun class and verb classes is relatively clear, the distinction between nouns and adjectives is often vague. Distinction between a noun and an adverb becomes unclear because structurally a word may be a noun but contextually it is adverb. Thus, the assumption made for word categories are depending upon the root category and affix information available from the dictionaries. At the moment, we use a sequential search of a stem from the root dictionary in alphabetical order. It is found to be suitable for small size dictionary. Further a part of root may also be a prefix which leads to wrong tagging. The verb morphology is more complex than that of noun. A comparative study on the number of words tagged by the system and manually tagged had been carried out. The inputs of 3784 Manipuri sentences of 10917 unique words as input to the tagger engine. Sometimes two words get fused to form a complete word. Handling such collocations is difficult. Conjuncts require a separate dealing using a table. Verbs, nouns and noun phrases, subordinate sentences, and root sentences can be affixed by enclitics. Table 4 shows the percentage statistics of tagging output based on the actual and correctly tagged words. The accuracy of tagging can be further improved by populating more root morphemes to the root dictionary.

Tagger output statistics  The unknown words are the words which could not be tagged based on the linguistic rules and unavailability of entries mainly in root dictionary. In the process of word formation, only affixation: prefixing, suffixing or compounding takes the role of formation of new words in this language. Due to the fact that new words are easily formed in Manipuri, thus the number of unknown words (out of vocabulary) is relatively large (Sirajul et al., 2004).

The Noun-Adjective ambiguity disambiguation scheme is required as a separate module and implementations are to be included in the future work. The Manipuri tagging is very much dependent on the morphological analysis and lexical rules of each category. There is a cleaning process of all word and morphemes specially the spelling to ensure that the lexical rules are implemented. This has not yet been implemented. Collocations handling and more disambiguation rules will be developed in further phases of the work. The output of the POS tagger will be used in a Manipuri-English machine translation system.
