The existing algorithms in GRE lie in two extremities. Incremental algorithm is simple and speedy but less expressive in nature whereas others are complex and exhaustive but more expressive in nature. Our prefix tree based model not only incorporates all relevant features of GRE (like describing set, generating Boolean and context sensitive description etc.) but also try to attain simplicity and speed properties of Incremental algorithm. Thus this model provides a simple and linguistically rich approach to GRE."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Generation of referring expression (GRE) is an important task in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems (Reiter and Dale, 1995). The task of any GRE algorithm is to find a combination of properties that allow the audience to identify an object (target object) from a set of objects (domain or environment). The properties should satisfy the target object and dissatisfy all other objects in the domain. We sometimes call it distinguishing description because it helps us to distinguish the target from potential distractors, called contrast set. When we generate any natural language text in a particular domain, it has been observed that the text is centered on certain objects for that domain. When we give introductory description of any object, we generally give full length description (e.g. “The large black hairy dog”). But the later references to that object tend to be shorter and only support referential communication goal of distinguishing the target from other objects. For example the expression “The black dog” suffices if the other dogs in the environment are all non black. Grice, an eminent philosopher of language, has stressed on brevity of referential communication to avoid conversational implicature. Dale (1992) developed Full Brevity algorithm based on this observation. It always generates shortest possible referring description to identify an object. But Reiter and Dale (1995) later proved that Full Brevity requirement is an NP-Hard task, thus computationally intractable and offered an alternative polynomial time Incremental Algorithm. This algorithm adds properties in a predetermined order, based on the observation that human speakers and audiences prefer certain kinds of properties when describing an object in a domain (Krahmer et al. 2003). The Incremental Algorithm is accepted as state of the art algorithm in NLG domain. Later many refinements (like Boolean description and set representation (Deemter 2002), context sensitivity (Krahmer et al 2002) etc) have been incorporated into this algorithm. Several approaches have also been made to propose an alternative algorithmic framework to this problem like graph-based (Krahmer et al. 2003), conceptual graph based (Croitoru and Deemter 2007) etc that also handle the above refinements. In this paper we propose a new Prefix Tree (Trie) based framework for modeling GRE problems. Trie is an ordered tree data structure which allows the organization of prefixes in such a way that the branching at each level is guided by the parts of prefixes. There are several advantages of this approach: 1) Trie data structure has already been extensively used in many domains where search is the key operation. 2) The structure is scalable and various optimized algorithms are there for time, space optimizations.","In this paper it is shown how scenes can be represented using a Trie (section 2) and how description generation can be formalized as a search problem (section 3). In section 4 the algorithm is explained using an example scene. In section 5, the basic algorithm is extended to take care of different scenarios. The algorithm is analyzed for time com-"]},{"title":"697","paragraphs":["plexity in section 6 and conclusion is drawn in section 7."]},{"title":"2 Modeling GRE Using Trie Structure","paragraphs":["In this section, it is shown how a scene can be represented using a trie data structure. The scheme is based on Incremental algorithm (Reiter and Dale 1995) and incorporates the attractive properties (e.g. speed, simplicity etc) of that algorithm. Later it is extended to take care of different refinements (like relational, boolean description etc) that could not be handled by Incremental algorithm. Reiter and Dale (1995) pointed out the notion of ‘PreferredAttributes’ (e.g. Type, Size, Color etc) which is a sequence of attributes of an object that human speakers generally use to identify that object from the contrast set. We assume that the initial description of an entity is following this sequence (e.g. “The large black dog”) then the later references will be some subset of initial description (like “The dog” or “The large dog”) which is defined as the prefix of the initial description. So, we have to search for a prefix of the initial full length description so that it is adequate to distinguish the target object. Following the Incremental version we will add properties one by one from the ‘PreferredAttributes’ list. In our model, the root consists of all entities in the domain and has empty description. Then at each level, branching is made based on different values of corresponding preferred attribute. The outgoing edge is labeled with that value. For example, at the first level, branching is made based on different values of ‘Type’ attribute like ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, ‘Poodle’ etc. A node in Trie will contain only those objects which have the property(s) expressed by the edges, constituting the path from root to that node. After construction of the Trie structure for a given domain in this way, referring expression generation problem for an object r is reduced to search the tree for a node which consists of r and no other object. Description for r can be found from the search path itself as we have said earlier. Now we will introduce some notations that we will use to describe the actual algorithm.

If Nk is leaf node then description of r will be same with the full description but if it is an intermediate node then description is some proper prefix of initial description. But the point is that, in both cases the later reference is prefix of initial one (as both “ab” and “abc” are prefixes of “abc”)."]},{"title":"3 Basic Algorithm","paragraphs":["Based on above discussions, algorithms are developed for construction of Trie from the domain and generation of reference description for any object in that domain.

If we reach a leaf node and that contains r along with other objects then it is not possible to distinguish r’. In that case, the algorithm returns NULL indicating that no description exists at all. It has been later shown that some distinguishing description may still exist and the algorithm will be modified to find that. It should be mentioned that once the prefix tree is constructed offline, it can be used repetitively to find description for any object in the domain throughout the text generation phase. Our MakeRefExpr() algorithm is very simple and it doesn’t employ any set theoretic operation, which is a non trivial task, to find current contrast set at every steps of algorithm. In existing algorithms, computing referential description for every object require computing similar things (like finding current contrast set, ruled out objects) again and again. And it has to be repeated every time the object is referred. It is not possible to generate description once, store it and use it later because of the fact that domain may also change in course of time (Krahmer, 2002). That’s why every time we want to refer to ‘r’, such rigorous set operations need to be computed. But in our prefix tree structure, once the tree is constructed, it is very easy to find description for that object using simple tree search function. It is also very easy to add/delete objects to/from domain. We have to follow just the initial properties of that object to find the proper branching at each level, followed by addition /deletion of that object to /from relevant nodes, which is essentially a search operation. The disadvantage of our algorithm is that space complexity is high but it can be tackled using bit Vector representation of individual nodes of the prefix tree. Besides, several methods are there for compressing Trie structure. But these optimization techniques are beyond the scope of our current discussion."]},{"title":"4 Formalizing A Scene using Prefix Tree","paragraphs":["Consider an example scene in figure 3, from [Krahmer 2002].

Let r = {d1}. In the first phase, starting from root, edge labeled D is traversed. Since d1 exists in the node and D discards some objects (d4), D is distinguishing description and it is added to L. In the next phase the node connected by the edge labeled L does not contain d1 so search will not proceed further. Rather the node connected by the edge labeled S contains d1. Since, d1 is the only object, then we are done and the referring expression is “The small dog”. But for d2, we have to search upto the leaf node which generates the description “The large white dog”.    Figure 3. Scene Representation"]},{"title":"5 Extension of Basic Algorithm 5.1 Specifying Overlapping Values","paragraphs":["Deemter (2002) has shown incompleteness of Incremental algorithm in case of overlapping values. Due to vagueness of properties, sometimes it is hard to classify an object in a particular class. Consider the example scene D = {a,b,c,d} Color: {Red(a,b); Orange(a,c,d)} Size: {Large(a,b); Small(c,d)}. In this case a can not be properly classified by Color type. Incremental algorithm always select Red(a,b) at first phase, since it rules out maximum distractors and returns failure because it can’t distinguish a from b at second phase. Deemter(2002) suggested inclusion of all overlapping values that are true of target while also removing some distractors. So, referring expression for a is “The red orange desk”. But it fails to obey Gricean maxims of conversational implicature. We consider the failure as ‘Early Decision’ problem and defer the decision making in our model. We keep in our mind the fact that human beings seldom take instantaneous decision. Rather they consider all opportunities in parallel and take decision in the favor of the best one at later point of time. Since, our algorithm searches in parallel through all promising branches until some description is found; it mimics the capabilities of human mind to consider in parallel. Our algorithm will generate “The large orange desk” which will help audiences to better identify the desk. The execution sequence is shown in figure 4.    Figure 4. Dealing with overlapping values"," 5.2 Describing Set of Objects Generation of referring description for a set of objects is very important in NLG. Deemter’s (2002) suggestion can be easily incorporated into our framework. We will represent target r as set of objects. Now our algorithm will try to find a node in the tree which only consists of all objects in the set r. In this way, we can find a distinguishing description for any set, for which description exists. In figure 3, the description for the set {d2,d3} is “The large dogs”. Thus, our basic algorithm is able to describe set of objects. In case of set like {d2, d3, d4} where there is no separate node consisting all the object, we need to partition the set and find description for individual set. In our case the possible partitions are {d2, d3} and {d4} for which separate nodes exist."]},{"title":"700 5.3 Boolean Descriptions","paragraphs":["Deemter (2002) shown that Incremental algorithm is only intersectively complete. But he argues that other Boolean combination of properties can be used to generate description for an object. Consider the example from (Deemter, 2002). Let D = {a, b, c, d, e} Type: {Dog(a,b,c,d,e); Poodle(a,b)} Color: {Black(a,b,c); White(d,e)} and r = {c}. In this scenario Incremental algorithm is not able to individuate any of the animals. However a description for c exists, “The black dog that is not a poodle”. Since {c} = [[Black]]"]},{"title":"̇","paragraphs":["[[ Poodle]]. Deemter (2002) has modified the Incremental algorithm by adding negative values for each attribute. Now we will show that our basic algorithm can be modified to take care of this situation. In our basic algorithm ConstructTrie(), we add branches at each level for negative values also. In this case our simple routine MakeRefExpr() is able to find boolean description while remaining as close as to Incremental algorithm. In figure 5, we show part of the trie structure, which is generated for the above scene. The dashed arrows show the alternative search paths for node containing {c}.",""," Figure 5. Trie structure (Partial) incorporating negation of properties"," For referring objects using disjunction of properties we have do same thing as negations. We have to extend our prefix tree structure by adding extra edges at different levels for making implicit information explicit as described in [Krahmer 2002]. 5.4 Incorporating Context Sensitivity Krahmer and Theune [2002] have added the notion of context sensitivity into GRE. Earlier algorithms assumed that all objects in environment are equally salient. Krahmer and Theune refined the idea by assigning some degree of salience to each object. They proposed that during referring any object, the object needs to be distinguished only from those objects which are more salient (having higher salience weight). An object that has been mentioned recently, is linguistically more salient than other objects and can be described using fewer properties (“The dog” instead of “The large black hairy dog”). They introduced the concept of centering theory, hierarchical focus constraints in the field of NLG and devised a constant function mapping sw: D fifififi , where sw is salience weight function, D is domain and is set of natural numbers. We can incorporate this idea into our model easily. In each node of the prefix tree we keep a field ‘salience weight’ (sw) for each of the object stored in that node in the form (di, swi). During describing an object if we find a node that is containing r where it is the most salient then we need not traverse higher depth of the tree. So, we have to modify MakeRefExpr() algorithm by adding more conditions.

In this way, our basic algorithm itself is capable of handling relational descriptions. The only modification that we add that when a relation R is included, the MakeRefExpr() should be called again for the relatum.
