In this paper we discuss our Hindi and Telugu to English CLIR system and the experiments using CLEF 2007 dataset. We used a variant of TFIDF algorithm in combination with a bilingual lexicon for query translation. We also explored the role of a document summary in fielded queries and two different boolean formulations of query translations. We find that a hybrid boolean formulation using a combination of boolean AND and boolean OR operators improves ranking of documents. We also find that simple disjunctive combination of translated query keywords results in maximum recall.                    "]}]}
