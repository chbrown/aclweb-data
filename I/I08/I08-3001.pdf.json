On a different axis, languages can be ranked according to the quantity and quality of computational resources. Not surprisingly, there are correlations be-tween these two axes: languages like English and Mandarin have substantial resources, while many of the smallest languages are completely undocumented. Nevertheless, the correlation is not perfect; there are languages with a million speakers which are more or less unwritten, and there are very large languages – some of the languages of India, for example – which are relatively resource-poor.","Unfortunately, what counts as resource-rich (or even resource-adequate) in computational linguistics is a moving target. For languages to move in the direction of resource richness, considerable effort (people and money) have to be provided over a prolonged period of time. One can sit back and wait for this to happen, or give up; alternatively, one can map out a realistic way forward, building on the strengths of each language’s situation.","Among the strengths which may prove useful to building computational resources for languages are the following:","• Long traditions of grammatical and lexical description • Traditions of literacy and literature • Local expertise in linguistics and computing • The world-wide community of linguists and computer experts • Resource availability in related languages At the same time, there are weaknesses and other problems – some language specific, some more gen-","eral – which need to be considered: • Lack of consensus on ways of representing the language (scripts, character encoding)","• Complexities inherent in particular languages (complex scripts, complex morphologies, variant orthographies, diglossia, dialectal variation) • Economic and educational realities in the countries where the language is spoken • Political attitudes towards some languages, particularly minority languages • The 'not invented here' syndrome • Software obsolescence, and the potential obsolescence of language data This talk will look at ways in which the strengths enumerated above might be leveraged, while avoiding the potential weaknesses. 1  2"]}]}
