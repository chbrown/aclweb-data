This is the third biennial conference organized by the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP), which was founded in 2004 to promote research and development efforts in the field of computational processing of natural languages of importance to the Asian region, without regard to differences in language, race, religious belief or political stand. The first IJCNLP was held to celebrate the inauguration of AFNLP on the beautiful Hainan Island in China (March 22-24, 2004), and the second on the fantastic Jeju Island in Korea (October 10-13, 2005). Following the continuing success of the previous two conferences, the third conference is held in yet another exotic and multicultural city of Hyderabad in India in January 7-12, 2008.","","On behalf of the Conference Committees, I would like to welcome all researchers and scholars who are working in all areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) around the world and who in particular have keen interest in Asian language processing. As the world proceeds quickly into the Information Age, we face both successes and challenges in creating a global information society, and it is well recognized nowadays that Natural Language Processing provides the key to the Information Age and to solving many of these challenges, like breaking language barrier and overcoming information flood. Over the last decades, a remarkable progress has been made in NLP research and development. However, there has been a pervasive feeling that the progress of NLP for Asian languages has not been commensurate with that for Western languages. Recently the importance of Asian languages has been steadily growing as Asia be-comes the dominant region of the world, economically, politically and culturally. In this context, this conference provides a forum for engineers and scientists to present and exchange their latest research findings in all aspects of NLP and thus to promote research and development activities for Asian language processing. This is the major motivation of IJCNLP.","","I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the authors of invited and contributed papers and to all conference participants for their active participations. I also wish to express my heartfelt gratitude and thanks to the Committee Members, particularly the Organizing Co-chairs Rajeev Sangal and Raji Bagga, the Program Co-chairs Yuji Matsumoto and Ann Copestake, the Publication Chair Jing-Shin Chang, and all the other Committee Chairs for their tremendous efforts and substantial contributions to the conference. I feel honored and blessed to be part of this conference as the Conference Chair working with such wonderful team. With our team efforts, I am confident that this conference will be even more successful than the previous. Finally, I hope that you will participate actively in all sessions and events to maximize the benefits from them, and I also wish all participants a very fruitful and enjoyable time during the conference in Hyderabad."," Jong-Hyeok Lee Conference Chair i"]},{"title":"Preface: Program Committee Co-Chairs","paragraphs":["This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-2008). IJCNLP is held approximately every two years as the flagship conference of the AFNLP (Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing). This year's conference, which follows the success of IJCNLP-2005 on Jeju Island in Korea, is in the city which is such a beautiful mixture of ancient civilization and modern industry: Hyderabad, India.","","On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to present this volume, which includes the accepted papers for oral and poster presentations at the conference. We received 266 submissions from 28 different regions all over the world; 74% from Asia, 15% from North America, 9% from Europe, 3% from Australia, and 0.4% from Africa.","","The paper selection was not easy with this large number of submission but with the devoted work of our 13 area chairs and 268 PC members, we were able to select very high quality papers. 75 papers (27.8%) were accepted for oral presentation and 62 papers (23.3%) were accepted for poster presentation. After a few withdrawals, this volume contains 74 oral papers and 60 poster papers.","","We are also very grateful to Professor Aravind Joshi (University of Pennsylvania), Professor Hyopil Shin (Seoul National University) and Dr S.H. Srinivasan (Yahoo!) for accepting to give keynote and invited talks, which surely make the conference more attractive.","","Organizing and hosting this size of international conference requires lots of help and effort from many people. We would like to send our greatest thanks to the Honorary Conference Chair, Professor Aravind Joshi and the Conference Chair, Professor Jong-Hyoek Lee for their continuous support and timely guidance. We would also thank the Local Organizing Co-Chairs Professor Rajeev Sangal and Dr Raji Bagga for their support, advice and responses to our numerous requests. Special thanks are due to the Publication Chair Professor Jing-Shin Chang. Without his very detailed format checking and efficient compilation, this volume of proceedings would not come out in the current form. We would like to express our highest gratitude to all the other Committee Chairs. Working with such a wonderful group of people has been great fun. Last but not least, we would like to thank all the people who submitted their papers and all the people who attend this conference.","","Welcome to IJCNLP-2008. We hope you enjoy this conference as much as we do.

Joshi","paragraphs":["Department of Computer and Information Science and","Institute for Research in Cognitive Science University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA ABSTRACT","First, I will describe the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)*, a corpus i\\n which we annotate the discourse connectives (explicit and implicit) and their arguments, together with \"attributions\" of the arguments and the relations denoted by the connectives, and also the senses of the connectives. I will then discuss some issues concerning the complexity of dependencies in terms of the elements that bear the dependency relations, the graph theoretic properties of these dependencies such as nested and crossed dependencies, dependencies with shared arguments, and finally, the attributions and their relationship to the dependencies, among others. We will compare these dependencies with those at the sentence level and then discuss some aspects that relate to the transition from the sentence level to the level of \"immediate discourse\" and propose some conjectures.","","----------------- * This 1 million-word corpus is the same as the WSJ corpus used by the Penn Treebank (PTB) for syn-","tactic annotation and by Propbank for predicate-argument annotation.

The project was funded by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Korean government. The goal of the project was to promote technological expertise in Korean language research and technology. The project consists of 8 sub-projects ranging from construction of Korean language resources to management and distribution of outputs from the work. The core part of the project is to compile an electronic lexical dictionary and to build a large-scale Korean corpus.","","The SELK focuses on an exhaustive representation of Korean linguistic knowledge by harmonizing linguistic validity, psychological reality, and computational efficiency. The SELK is composed of various sub-dictionaries corresponding to the parts-of-speech-based word categories such as nouns, verbs, adverbs etc. The lexicon shows a considerable differentiation from other paperback or machine-readable dictionaries in Korean in its precise and comprehensive representation.","","The KNC project has two sub-divisions, one for a general corpus and the other for a special corpus. The general corpus division collected a wide range of unconstrained materials and endeavored at annotating the data with parts-of-speech, syntactic, and semantic tags. The special data division, on the other hand, constructed Korean-English and Korean-Japanese corpora, a historical corpus, and a corpus used by North Koreans and overseas Koreans.","","The SELK and the KNC are beginning to serve as important research tools for investigators in natural language processing as well as in theoretical linguistics. Annotated corpora and well-established electronic dictionaries promise to be valuable for enterprises such as the construction of statistical models for the grammar of written and spoken Korean, the development of software for Korean language processing, and even the publication of the paperback Korean dictionaries.","","In this speech, I will introduce the 21st Sejong Project and review my experience with constructing one such large language resource - the SELK, consisting of about 600,000 lexical entries, and the KNC, consisting of about 500 million word collections. Considering the size and time needed to develop it, this project deserves great attention. We, however, also experienced a lot of difficulties through trial and error, inevitably originating from such a long work period and the large scale of the work. We hope sharing such experiences will help researchers with the same interests, to break through the obstacles and to avoid mistakes we have made for a decade.  iv"]},{"title":"Invited Talk: Language Processing for the Evolving Web Srinivasan Sengamedu","paragraphs":["Yahoo!, Bangalore ABSTRACT","World Wide Web brings several new dimensions to language processing - social, multimodal, structural, etc. The social dimension arises from the tagging phenomenon, multimodal from the coexistence of images and videos with text in web documents, and structure from rich formatting of web pages. While the massive amounts of data available has made new approaches to translation, summarization, and extraction possible, next generation applications like semantic search require radically new theoretical ideas.
