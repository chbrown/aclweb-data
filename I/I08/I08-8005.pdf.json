The multi-stage based speech recognition is a method to reduce the computational complexity of the decoding procedure and thus accomplish faster speech recognition. In the multi-stage speech recognition, however, the error of previous stage is transferred to the next stage. This tends to cause the deterioration of the overall performance. We focus on improving the accuracy by introducing confidence vector instead of phoneme which typically used as an intermediate feature between the acoustic decoder and the lexical decoder, the first two stages in the multi-stage speech recognition. The experimental results show up to 16.4% error reduction rate(ERR) of word accuracy for 220k Korean Point-of-Interest (POI) domain and 29.6% ERR of word accuracy for hotel reservation dialog domain."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently, demand of fast and small size speech recognition engine is increasing. One example is the mobile automatic speech translation device. To implement the speech translation function, we need to integrate the speech recognition, the text translation, and the speech synthesis modules all together into a single device. Another example is recognition of Point-of-Interests (POIs) on navigation device. The number of POIs used in a commercial navigation system is about several hundreds of thousands to one million. To make a fast and more efficient speech recognition engine, many computationally efficient methods were reported and multi-stage speech recognition is one of competitive approaches [1][2].","The multi-stage speech recognition completes recognition procedure through sequential two stage decoding, the acoustic decoding and the lexical decoding. The optional rescoring stage can follow the lexical decoding, depending on the application. In the acoustic decoding stage, we find the phoneme sequence which has the maximum likelihood for a sequence of input acoustic feature vector. In the lexical decoding, we recover the optimal word sequence whose phone sequence has a minimal edit distance from an input phoneme sequence from the acoustic decoding stage.","Comparing to the one-stage speech recognition, the multi-stage speech recognition can significantly reduce computation load. This is because the lexical decoding stage in the multi-stage speech recognition is repeated for every phoneme in the input phoneme sequence, while the lexical decoding stage in the one-stage speech recognition is repeated for typically every ten milliseconds. Since the duration of a phoneme is up to several hundred milliseconds, this computational saving is quite big, especially for cases with a large lexical search space. However, the multi-stage speech recognition has a shortcoming that the overall performance is highly affected by accuracy level of the phoneme recognizer. Moreover, the performance of the phoneme recognizer is generally poor since it depends only on the acoustic feature without using any higher level of information like a language model.","In this paper, we propose a new method of using a confidence vector as an input feature for lexical decoding stage to improve performance of multi-stage speech recognition system. For a phoneme segment, we introduce a confidence vector in which each element is defined as the likelihood of each phoneme for the given segment. And, we use this confidence vector as the input feature for the lexical decoder rather than just the phoneme sequence as in the conventional multi-stage speech recognition. This means that more information is transferred from acoustic decoder to lexical decoder.","This paper is organized as follows. At first, we present the structure of multi-stage speech recognition in section 2. In section 3, we describe the proposed method that uses confidence vector as an input feature of lexical decoding. In section 4, we explain the experiment environment and results. Finally, we summarize our work in section 5."]},{"title":"2 Multi-Stage Speech Recognition","paragraphs":["Multi-stage speech recognition system is composed of acoustic decoder, lexical decoder and optional n-best rescoring [2][3].","The purpose of acoustic decoding is to convert an input acoustic feature sequence into a corresponding phoneme sequence as correctly as possible while minimizing the consumption of computational power. In most cases, CDHMM-based automatic phone recognizer is used for acoustic decoding. In this work, we also used automatic phone recognizer for the acoustic decoding, in which CDHMMs corresponding to 46 Korean phonemes including silence are used and a finite state network representing Korean syllable composition structure is used for pronunciation model.","The purpose of the lexical decoding is to recover an optimal word sequence from input phoneme sequence given as a result of acoustic decoding. Acoustic decoder may generate three types of phone errors, substitution, insertion and deletion for a reference phoneme due to inaccurate acoustic modeling, surrounding noises and so on. We model these error patterns in the form of probabilistic edit cost. For each speech utterance in training DB, the lexical decoder aligns phoneme sequence from the acoustic decoder with the phoneme sequence of reference words by dynamic time warping (DTW). By accumulating the alignment results for all the utterances in training DB, we obtain the substitution probability of each phoneme. While decoding, the cost at each node is derived from the substitution probability of each phoneme."]},{"title":"3 Confidence Vector Based Approach","paragraphs":["In this paper, we introduce a phoneme confidence vector as an input feature for lexical decoding. This confidence vector based approach comprises four stages, phoneme segmentation, confidence vector extraction, lexical decoding, n-best rescoring. Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of the multi-stage speech recognition using confidence vector.","   Figure 1. Block diagram of multi-stage speech recognition using confidence vector.  Firstly, the automatic phoneme recognizer finds optimal phoneme boundary information for an input utterance and then every acoustic likelihood corresponding to each of 46 Korean phoneme units is calculated for each segment, according to the phone segmentation result.

For confidence vector approach, we defined lexical model as mean of confidence vectors of each phoneme. The cost of DTW is defined with mean of confidence vectors of reference phoneme and confidence vectors of input speech segment. We use three cost definitions that represent distance between two confidence vectors.  "," Figure 2.

Test set comprises with 7 speakers, each speaker makes 99 utterances, so total test set is 693 utterances.","The speech signal was sampled at 16kHz, and the frame length was 20ms with 10ms shift. Each speech frame was parameterized as a 39dimentional feature vector containing 12 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), C0 energy, their delta and delta-delta coefficients. In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed algorithm on acoustically, lexically mismatched condition, we took the experiments in two different test environment where N-fold test means the test is done in lexically matched condition and open test in acoustically and lexically mismatched condition. N-fold Test In order to reflect phoneme error patterns to the lexical decoding, we used the phoneme result of 6 speaker’s utterance to train lexical model. We performed test for remained one speaker data, and we did 7 times with different test speakers. Each case training data of lexical model is 594 utterances and test data is 99 utterances. Lexical model is substitution probability or mean of confidence vector for reference phoneme.","Because training data of lexical model has the same vocabulary with test data and the same channel condition, training of lexical model in N-fold test can train error pattern of same vocabulary and environment condition. Table 1 shows the result of N-fold test experiment. Conventional multi-stage speech recognition method uses phoneme sequence as an input feature for lexical decoding, and its performance is the lowest among the rest methods. Because the phoneme accuracy of acoustic decoder is about 60~70% for this open test set, the performance of conventional method is degraded. If we use confidence vector as input feature for lexical decoding, the performance is increased by almost 10%. This performance enhancement proves that the confidence vector contains more useful information at lexical decoding. The cost definition with weighted sum of confidence has a similar performance with Kullback-Leibler divergence that is a well known distance measure. Especially with smoothing of confidence we get the best performance, but smoothing makes the search network enlarge and slow down a little because smoothing reduces the differences between confidence vectors."," Lexical Feature Cost Definition N-best Word Recognition Rate (%) 1 5 10 Phoneme Sequence Substitution Prob. 64.5 75.6 78.6 Confidence Vector KL Divergence 74.5 88.7 91.8 Weighted sum of Confidence 74.5 88.5 92.4 Smoothing of Confidence 78.8 90.9 93.8","Table 1.

For an open test, we trained lexical model using word DB. We used ETRI phonetically optimized word (POW) DB which has 92k utterances.","Table 2 shows the results of open test experiments. If we use phoneme sequence as input feature for lexical decoder, performance is better than N-fold test. Because training DB for lexical model is enlarged to 92k, substitution probability might be modeled correctly. But confidence vector approach shows some performance degradations from N-fold test. In N-fold test, the performance is highly affected by the training of error pattern of certain vocabulary. In open test, KL divergence has better performance than cost definition by weighted sum of confidence in n-best aspect.

When we use smoothing method, 500-best performance is 99.1%. Since the performance of N-best rescoring is highly dependent with 500-best performance, conventional multi-stage method has the worst rescoring performance. Because 500-best performance of weighted sum of confidence and smoothing method are similar, the performance of N-best rescoring is almost same for these two cost definitions.
