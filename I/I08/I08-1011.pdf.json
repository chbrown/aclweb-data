Translat-ing analytic languages into Indo-European languages suffers the issues of gapping, because “deletion under coordination” and “verb serialization” are necessary to be resolved beforehand. Rudimentary operations, i.e. antecedent memorization, gap induction, and gap resolution, were introduced to the categorial grammar to resolve gapping issues syntactically. Hereby, pronominal references can be generated for deletion under coordination, while sentence structures can be properly selected for verb serialization."]},{"title":"1 Background","paragraphs":["Analytic language, such as Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, is any language whose syntax and meaning relies on particles and word orders rather than inflec-tion. Pronouns and other grammatical information, such as tense, aspect, and number, expressed by use of adverbs and adjectives, are often omitted. In addi-tion to deletion under coordination and verb serialization, called gapping (Hendriks, 1995), translation from analytic languages into Indo-European ones becomes a hard task because (1) an ordinary parser cannot parse some problematic gapping patterns and (2) these omissions are necessary to be resolved be-forehand. We classify resolution of the issue into two levels: syntactic/semantic and pragmatic. Gapping, which we considered as a set of bound variables, can be resolved in syntactic/semantic level (Partee, 1975). Omission of other grammatical in-formation is, on the contrary, to be resolved in pragmatic level because some extra-linguistic knowledge is required. Consequently, we concentrate in this paper the resolution of gapping by means of syntax and semantics.","Many proposals to gap resolution were introduced, but we classify them into two groups: non-ellipsis-based and ellipsis-based. Non-ellipsis-based approach is characterized by: (a) strong proof system (Lambek, 1958), and (b) functional composition and type raising that allow coordination of incomplete constituents, such as CG (Ajdukiewicz, 1935; Bar-Hillel, 1953; Moortgat, 2002), CCG (Steedman, 2000), and multimodal CCG (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003). Proposals in this approach, such as (Hendriks, 1995; Jäger, 1998a; Jäger, 1998b), introduced specialized operators to resolve overt anaphora, while covert anaphora is left unsolved. Ellipsis-based approach is characterized by treat-ing incomplete constituents as if they are of the same simple type but contain ellipsis inside (Yatabe, 2002; Cryssmann, 2003; Beavers and Sag, 2004). However, Beavers and Sag (2004) evidenced that ellipsis-based analysis possibly reduces the acceptability of language, because the resolution is per se completely uncontrolled.","In this paper, we introduce an integration of the two approaches that incorporates strong proof system and ellipsis-based analysis. Antecedent memorization and gap induction are introduced to imitate ellipsis-based analysis.

Section 2 describes the formalization of our method. Section 3 evidences the coverage of the framework on coping with the gapping issues in analytic languages. Section 4 further discusses coverage and limitations of the framework comparing with CG and its descendants. Section 5 explains relevance of the proposed formalism to MT. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and lists up future work."]},{"title":"2 Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar","paragraphs":["Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar, abbrevi-ated MICG, is a version of pure categorial grammar extended by ellipsis-based analysis. On the contrary, it relies on antecedent memorization, gap induction, and gap resolution that outperform CCG’s functional composition and type raising.","All grammatical expressions of MICG are, like CG, distinguished by a syntactic category identify-ing them as either a function from arguments of one type to result another (a.k.a. function), or an argument (a.k.a. primitive category). Let us exemplify the MICG by defining an example grammar G be-low. John, Mary, sandwich, noodle ⊢ np eats ⊢ (np\\s)/np and ⊢ & The lexicons John, Mary, sandwich, and noodle are assigned with a primitive category np. The lexicon eats is assigned with a function that forms a sentence s after taking np from the right side (/np) and then taking np from the left side (np\\). The lexicon and is assigned with a conjunction category (&). By means of syntactic categories assigned to each lexicon, the derivation for a simple sentence ‘John eats noodle’ is shown in (1).","John eats noodle","John ⊢ np eats ⊢ (np\\s)/np noodle ⊢ np","eats ◦ noodle ⊢ np\\s","John ◦ (eats ◦ noodle) ⊢ s (1)","CG suffers some patterns of coordination e.g. SVO&SO as exemplified in (2). John eats noodle, and Mary, sandwich.(2) One should find that the second conjunct cannot be reduced into s by means of CG, because it lacks of the main verb ‘eats.’ The main verb in the first conjunct should be remembered and then filled up to the ellipsis of the second conjunct to accomplish the derivation. This matter of fact motivated us to develop MICG by introducing to CG the process of remembering an antecedent from a conjunct, called memorization, and filling up an ellipsis in the other conjunct, called induction. There are three mandatory operations in MICG: antecedent memorization, gap induction, and gap resolution.","One of two immediate formulae combined in the derivation can be memorized as an antecedent. The resulted syntactic category is modalized by the modality D","F , where D is a direction of memorization (< for the left side and > for the right side), and F is the memorized formula. The syntactic structure of the memorized formula is also modalized with the notation to denote the memorization. It is restricted in MICG that the memorized formula must be unmodalized to maintain mild contextsensitivity. For example, let us consider the derivation of the first conjunct of (2), ‘John eats noodle,’ with antecedent memorization at the verb ‘eats’ in (3). As seen, a modalized formula can combine with another unmodalized formula while all modalities are preserved.","John eats noodle","John ⊢ np eats ⊢ (np\\s)/np noodle ⊢ np","eats ◦ noodle ⊢ <","eats⊢(np\\s)/np(np\\s)","John ◦ (eats ◦ noodle) ⊢ <","eats⊢(np\\s)/nps (3)","Any given formula can be induced for a missing formula, or a gap, at any direction, and the induced gap contains a syntactic category that can be combined to that of the formula.

The syntactic structure of F is an uninstantiated variable and also modalized with the notation to denote the induction.

Each of which complicates the analysis module of MT to resolve such issue before transferring. In this section, problematic gapping patterns are analyzed in forms of generalized patterns by MICG. For simplification reason, syntactic structure is suppressed during derivation. 3.1 To resolve gapping under coordination Coordination in analytic languages is more complex than that of Indo-European ones. Multi-conjunct coordination is suppressed here because biconjunct coordination can be applied. Besides SVO&VO and SV&SVO patterns already resolved by CCG (Steedman, 2000), there are also SVO&SV, SVO&V, SVO&SO (already illustrated in Figure 1), and SVO&SA patterns.","The pattern SVO&SV exhibits ellipsis at the object position of the second conjunct.

Usually, the verbs have a single structural object and share logical arguments (Baker, 1989). Following (Li and Thompson, 1981; Wang, 2007; Thepkanjana, 2006), we classify SVC into three main types: consecutive/concurrent events, purpose, and circumstance.","No operation specialized for tracing antecedent projection in consecutive/concurrent event construction has been proposed in CG or its descendants. In MICG, the serialization operation is specialized for this construction. For example, a Chinese sentence from (Wang, 2007) in (8) is analyzed as in (9). tā mǎi pi ào jı̄n q ù he buy ticket enter go ‘He buys a ticket and then goes inside.’ (8)","tā mǎi pi ào jı̄n q ù","np (np\\s)/np np np\\s np\\s np\\s <","nps <","nps < nps <","nps s (9) Illustrated in (9), the subject argument tā ‘he’ is projected through the verb sequence by means of memorization and induction modalities.","Purpose construction can also be handled by MICG.

Node raising is analyzed in terms of MICG by memorizing the raised constituent at the conjunct it occurs and inducing a gap at the other conjunct. For example, the right node ‘ice cream’ is raised in the sentence ‘I like but you don’t like ice cream.’ The sentence can be analyzed in terms of MICG in (14).","I like but you don’t like ice cream","np (np\\s)/np & np (np\\s)/np np > np(np\\s) >","np(np\\s) > nps >","nps s (14)","Topicalization and contraposition are still the issues to be concerned for coverage over CCG. For example, in an example sentence ‘Bagels, Yo said that Jan likes’ from (Beavers and Sag, 2004), the NP ‘Bagels’ is topicalized from the object position of the relative clause’s complement. (15) shows unparsability of the sentence.","Bagels, Yo said that Jan likes","np np (np\\s)/cl cl/s np (np\\s)/np > np(np\\s) > nps > nps > np(np\\s) > nps ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ (15)","Furthermore, constituent shifting, such as dative shift and adjunct shift, is not supported by MICG. We found that it is also constituent extraction as consecutive constituents other than the shifted one are extracted from the sentence. For example, the adjunct ‘skillfully’ is shifted next to the main verb in the sentence ‘Kahn blocked skillfully a powerful shot by Ronaldo’ from (Baldridge, 2002) in (16).","a powerful shot","Kahn blocked skillfully by Ronaldo","np (np\\s)/np (np\\s)\\(np\\s) np",">","np(np\\s) >","np(np\\s) > nps ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ (16)","Since MICG was inspired by reasons other than those of CCG, the coverage of MICG is therefore different from CCG. Let us compare CG, CCG, and MICG in Table 1. CCG initially attempted to handle linguistic phenomena in English and other Indo-European languages, in which topicalization and dative shift play an important role. Applied to many other languages such as German, Dutch, Japanese, and Turkish, CCG is still unsuitable for analytic languages. MICG instead was inspired by deletion under coordination and serial verb construction in analytic languages. We are in progress to develop an extension of MICG that allows topicalization and dative shift avoiding combinatoric explosion."]},{"title":"5 Relevance to RBMT","paragraphs":["Major issues of MT from analytic languages into Indo-European ones include three issues: anaphora generation, semantic duplication, and sentence structuring. Both syntax and semantics are used to solve such problems by MICG’s capability of gap resolution. Case studies from our RBMT are exemplified for better understanding.","Our Thai-English MT system is rule-based and consists of three modules: analysis, transfer, and generation. MICG is used to tackle sentences with deletion under coordination and SVC which cannot be parsed by ordinary parsers. For good speed efficiency, an MICG parser was implemented in GLRbased approach and used to analyze the syntactic structure of a given sentence before transferring. The parser detects zero anaphora and resolves their antecedents in coordinate structure, and reveals argument sharing in SVC. Therefore, coordinate structure and SVC can be properly translated.","No experiment has been done on our system yet, but we hope to see an improvement of translation quality. We planned to evaluate the translation accuracy by using both statistical and human methods."]},{"title":"84","paragraphs":["Table 1: Coverage comparison among CG, CCG, and MICG (Y = supported, N = not supported) Linguistic phenomena CG CCG MICG","Basic application Y Y Y","Node raising N Y Y","Topicalization/contraposition N Y N","Constituent shifting N Y N","Deletion under coordination N N Y Serial verb construction N N Y 5.1 Translation of deletion under coordination Coordinate structures in Thai drastically differ from those of English. This is because Thai allows zero anaphora at subject and object positions while English does not. Pronouns and VP ellipses must therefore be generated in place of deletion under coordination for grammaticality of English. Moreover, semantic duplication is often made use to emphasize the meaning of sentence, but its direct translation becomes redundant.","MICG helps us detect zero anaphora and resolve their antecedents, so that appropriate pronouns and ellipses can be generated at the right positions. By tracing resolved antecedents and ellipses, argument projections are disclosed and they can be used to control verb fusion. We exemplify three cases of translation of coordinate structure.","Case 1: Pronouns are generated to maintain grammaticality of English translation if the two verbs are not postulated in the verb-fusion table. For example, a Thai sentence in (17) is translated, while pronouns ‘he’ and ‘it’ are generated from Thai NPs nák;rian ‘student’ and kh","à;nǒm ‘candy,’ respectively. nák;rianS s Ẃ:V kh","à;nǒmO lÉ:V& kinV student buy candy then eat ‘A student buys candy, then he eats it.’ (17)","Case 2: Two verbs V1 and V2 are fused togetherif they are postulated in the verb-fusion table to eliminate semantic duplication in English translation. The object form of S2 is necessary to be generated in some cases. For example, in (18), the translation becomes ‘He reports her this matter’ instead of ‘He tells her to know this matter.’ Two verbs bÒ:k ‘tell’ and sâ:b ‘know’ are fused into a single verb ‘report.’ The object form of ‘she,’ ‘her,’ is also generated. kh","ǎVS bÒ:kV hâj& th@:S sâ:pV r Ŵ:@N nı́:O he tell TO she know this matter ‘He reports her this matter.’ (18)","Case 3: A VP ellipsis is generated to maintain English grammaticality.

Thai uses SVC to describe consecutive/concurrent events, purposes, and circumstances. On the other hand, English describes each of those with different sentence structure. A series of verbs with duplicated semantics can be also clustered to emphasize the meaning of sentence in Thai, while English does not allow this phenomenon.","Because MICG reveals argument sharing in SVC, appropriate sentence structures can be selected by tracing argument sharing between two consecutive verbs. We exemplify two cases of translation of SVC.","Case 1: The second verb is participialized if the first verb is intransitive and its semantic concept is an action.

Theorem 1 (Cross-serial association) For every string generated from MICG w = p1q1 ... plql p j(l)q j(1) ... p j(l)q j(l) p j(l)+1, every couple qi and q j(i) are associated by \\b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l, where j(i) = l + i and l ≥ 0.","Proof Let us prove this property by mathematical induction. Basic step: Let l = 0. We obtain that w0 = p1. Since there is","no unpaired substring, this case is trivially proven. Hypothesis: Let l = k. Suppose that wk =","p1q1 ... p j(k)q j(k) p j(k)+1. We rewrite wk = w1","kw2","k, where w1","k =","p1q1 ... pkqk p′ j(1) and w2","k = p′′","j(1)q j(1) ... p j(k)q j(k) p j(k)+1.","Every couple qi and q j(k) are associated by \\b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.","Induction: Let l = k + 1; wk+1 = p1q1 ... p j(k)+2q j(k)+2","p j(k)+3, consequently. Let the formulae of the substrings","wk+1 = w1","k+1w2 k+1 be t1","k+1 ⊢ m1M1 and t2","k+1 ⊢ m2M2, respec-","tively. We can rewrite the substrings wk+1 = w1","k+1w2","k+1 in terms","of wk = w1 kw2 k in three cases.","Case I: Suppose w1","k+1 = pqw1","k. It follows that the direction","of q is <. Since w1 k+1 combines w2","k+1, we can conclude that","w2","k+1 = p′ q′ w2 k. Therefore, q and q′","are also associated by \\b .","Case II: Suppose w1","k+1 = w1","kqp. It follows that the direction","of q is >. Since w1 k+1 combines w2","k+1, we can conclude that","w2","k+1 = w2 kq′","p′",". Therefore, q and q′","are also associated by \\b .","Case III: w1 k+1 = p1q1 ... pmqm pqpm+1qm+1 ... pnqn pk+1 and","w2","k+1 = p j(1)q j(1) ... p j(m′",")q j(m′",") p′","q′","p","j(m′",")+1q j(m′",")+1 ... p j(k)","q j(k) p j(k)+1, where 1 < m,m′ < k. Since w1","k+1 and w2","k+1","combine and every qi and q j(i) are associated, we can conclude","that m = m′",". Therefore, q and q′ are also associated by \\b .","From Case I, Case II, and Case III, we can rewrite w1","k+1 =","p′","1q′","1 p′","2q′","2 ... p′","k+1 and w2","k+1 = p′","j(1)q′","j(1) p′","j(2)q′","j(2) ... p′","j(k+1).","Since each qi in w1","k and q j(i) in w2","k are already associated by","\\b , it follows that all qi and q j(i)+1 are also associated. ■"]},{"title":"87","paragraphs":[]}]}
