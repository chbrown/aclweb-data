The web is anarchic, and its use is not in the familiar territory of computational linguistics. The web walked into the ACL meetings started in 1999. The use of the web as a corpus for teaching and research on language technology has been proposed a number of times (Rundel, 2000; Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher, 2003). There is a long history of creating a standard for western language resources. The human language technology (HLT) society in Europe has been particularly zealous for the standardization, making a series of attempts such as EAGLES3",", PROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), ISLE/MILE (Calzolari et al., 2003; Bertagna et al., 2004) and more recently multilingual lexical database generation from parallel texts in 20 European languages (Giguet and Luquet, 2006). On the other hand, in spite of having great linguistic and cultural diversities, Asian language resources have received much less attention than their western counterparts. A new project (Takenobou et al., 2006) has been started to create a common standard for Asian language resources. They have extended an existing description framework, the  3 http://www.ilc.cnr.it/Eagles96/home.html The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 1 MILE (Bertagna et al., 2004), to describe several lexical entries of Japanese, Chinese and Thai. India is a multilingual country with the enormous cultural diversities. (Bharati et al., 2001) reports on efforts to create lexical resources such as transfer lexicon and grammar from English to several Indian languages and dependency tree bank of annotated corpora for several Indian languages. Corpus development work from web can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) for Bengali.","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the core components in most Information Extraction (IE) and Text Mining systems. During the last few years, the probabilistic machine learning methods have become state of the art for NER (Bikel et al., 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002) and for field extraction (McCallum et al., 2000). Most prominently, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used for the information extraction task (Bikel et al., 1999). Beside HMM, there are other systems based on Support Vector Machine (Sun et al., 2003) and Naïve Bayes (De Sitter and Daelemans, 2003). Maximum Entropy (ME) conditional models like ME Markov models (McCallum et al., 2000) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) were reported to outperform the generative HMM models on several IE tasks.","The existing works in the area of NER are mostly in non-Indian languages. There has been a very little work in the area of NER in Indian languages (ILs). In ILs, particularly in Bengali, the work in NER can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b; Ekbal et al., 2007c). Other than Bengali, the work on NER can be found in (Li and McCallum, 2003) for Hindi.","Newspaper is a huge source of readily available documents. In the present work, the corpus has been developed from the web archive of a very well known and widely read Bengali newspaper. Bengali is the seventh popular language in the world, second in India and the national language of Bangladesh. A code conversion routine has been written that converts the proprietary codes used in the newspaper into the standard Indian Script Code for Information Interchange (ISCII) form, which can be processed for various tasks. A separate code conversion routine has been developed for convert-ing ISCII codes to UTF-8 codes. A portion of this corpus has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags as described in Table 3. Another portion of the corpus has been manually annotated with the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages. A table driven semi-automatic NE tag conversion routine has been developed in order to convert this corpus to a form tagged with the twelve NE tags. The NE tagged corpus has been used to develop Named Entity Recognition (NER) system in Bengali using pattern directed shallow parsing approach, HMM, ME, CRF and SVM frameworks.","A number of detailed experiments have been conducted to identify the best set of features for NER in Bengali. The ME, CRF and SVM based NER models make use of the language independent as well as language dependent features. The language independent features could be applicable for NER in other Indian languages also. The system has demonstrated the highest F-Score value of 91.8% with the SVM framework. One possible reason behind its best performance may be the flexibility of the SVM framework to handle the morphologically rich Indian languages."]},{"title":"2 Development of the Named Entity Tagged Bengali News Corpus 2.1 Language Resource Acquisition","paragraphs":["A web crawler has been developed that retrieves the web pages in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) format from the news archive of a leading Bengali newspaper within a range of dates provided as input. The crawler generates the Universal Resource Locator (URL) address for the index (first) page of any particular date. The index page contains actual news page links and links to some other pages (e.g., Advertisement, TV schedule, Tender, Comics and Weather etc.) that do not contribute to the corpus generation. The HTML files that contain news documents are identified and the rest of the HTML files are not considered further. 2.2 Language Resource Creation The HTML files that contain news documents are identified by the web crawler and require cleaning to extract the Bengali text to be stored in the corpus along with relevant details. The HTML file is scanned from the beginning to look for tags like <fontFACE=BENGALI_FONT_NAME>...<font>, where the BENGALI_FONT_NAME is the name The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 2 of one of the Bengali font faces as defined in the news archive. The Bengali text enclosed within font tags are retrieved and stored in the database after appropriate tagging. Pictures, captions and tables may exist anywhere within the actual news. Tables are integral part of the news item. The pictures, its captions and other HTML tags that are not relevant to our text processing tasks are discarded during the file cleaning. The Bengali news corpus has been developed in both ISCII and UTF-8 codes. The tagged news corpus contains 108,305 number of news documents with about five (5) years (2001-2005) of news data collection. Some statistics about the tagged news corpus are presented in Table 1."," Total number of news documents in the corpus 108, 305 Total number of sentences in the corpus 2, 822, 737 Avgerage number of sentences in a document 27 Total number of wordforms in the corpus 33, 836, 736 Avgerage number of wordforms in a document 313 Total number of distinct wordforms in the corpus 467, 858 Table 1. Corpus Statistics 2.3 Language Resource Annotation The Bengali news corpus collected from the web is annotated using a tagset that includes the type and subtype of the news, title, date, reporter or agency name, news location and the body of the news. A part of this corpus is then tagged with a tagset, consisting of sixteen NE tags and one non-NE tag. Also, a part of the corpus has been tagged with a tagest of twelve NE tags4",", defined for the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.","A news corpus, whether in Bengali or in any other language, has different parts like title, date, reporter, location, body etc. To identify these parts in a news corpus the tagset, described in Table 2, has been defined. The reporter, agency, location, date, bd, day and ed tags help to recognize the person name, organization name, location name  4 http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=3 and the various date expressions that appear in the fixed places of the newspaper. These tags are not able to recognize the various NEs that appear within the actual news body.","In order to identify NEs within the actual news body, we have defined a tagset consisting of seventeen tags. We have considered the major four NE classes, namely ‘Person name’, ‘Location name’, ‘Organization name’ and ‘Miscellaneous name’. Miscellaneous names include the date, time, number, percentage and monetary expressions. The four major NE classes are further divided in order to properly denote each component of the multiword NEs. The NE tagset is shown in Table 3 with the appropriate examples.","We have also tagged a portion of the corpus as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages. This tagset has twelve different tags. The underlying reason for adopting these tags was the necessity of a slightly finer tagset for various natural language processing (NLP) applications and particularly for machine translation. The IJCNLP-08 NER shared task tagset is shown in Table 4.","One important aspect of IJCNLP-08 NER shared task was to annotate only the maximal NEs and not the structures of the entities. For example, mahatma gandhi road is annotated as location and assigned the tag ‘NEL’ even if mahatma and gandhi are NE title person and person name, respectively, according to the IJCNLP-08 shared task tagset. These internal structures of the entities need to be identified during testing. So, mahatma gandhi road will be tagged as mahatma/NETP gandhi/NEP road/NEL. The structure of the tagged element using the Shakti Standard Format (SSF)5"," will be as follows: 1 (( NP <ne=NEL> 1.1 (( NP <ne=NEP> 1.1.1 (( NP <ne=NETP> 1.1.1.1 mahatma",")) 1.1.2 gandhi",")) 1.2 road",")) 5 http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL 2007/ssf.html The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 3","2.4 Partially Tagged News Corpus Development A news document is stored in the corpus in XML format using the tagset, mentioned in Table 2. In the HTML news file, the date is stored at first and is divided into three parts. The first one is the date according to Bengali calendar, second one is the day in Bengali and the last one is the date according to English calendar. Both Bengali and English dates are stored in the form ‘day month year’.","A sequence of four Bengali digits separates the Bengali date from the Bengali day. The English date starts with one/two digits in Bengali font. Bengali date, day and English date can be distinguished by checking the appearance of the numerals and these are tagged as <bd>, <day> and <ed>, respectively. For e.g., 25 sraban 1412 budhbar 10 august 2005 is tagged as shown in Table 5. ","Table 2.

A portion of this corpus, containing 150K wordforms, has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags that are listed in Table 3. The corpus has been annotated with the help of Sanchay Editor, a text editor for Indian languages. The detailed statistics of this NE-tagged corpus are given in Table 6. The corpus is in SSF form, which has the following structure:    <Story id=\"\"> <Sentence id=\"\"> 1 biganni NNE 2 newton PER 3 . </Sentence id=\"\">",". </Story id=\"\"> ","Another portion of the partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus has been manually annotated as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task with the twelve NE tags, as listed in Table 4. The annotation process has been very difficult due to the presence of a number of ambiguous NE tags. The potential ambiguous NE tags are: NED vs NETP, NEO vs NEB, NETE vs NETO, NETO vs NETP and NEN vs NEM. For example, it is difficult to decide whether ‘Agriculture’ is ‘NETE’, and if no then whether ‘Horticulture’ is ‘NETE’ or not. In fact, this the most difficult class to identify. This NE tagged corpus contains approximately 30K wordforms. Details statistics of this tagged corpus are shown in Table 7. This NE tagged corpus is in the following SSF form.  <Story id=\"\"> <Sentence id=\"\">","1 (( NP <ne=NEP>","1.1 (( NP <ne=NED>","1.1.1 biganni",")) 1.1.2 newton NEP","))","2 . </Sentence id=\"\"> </Story id=\"\">  NE Class Number of","wordforms","Number of dis-","tinct wordforms Person name 20, 455 15, 663 Location name 11, 668 5, 579 Organization name 963 867 Miscellaneous name 11,554 3, 227 Table 6. Statistics of the 150K-tagged Corpus The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 5 2.6 Tag Conversion A tag conversion routine has been developed in order to convert the sixteen-NE tagged corpus of 150K wordforms to the corpus, tagged with the IJCNLP-08 twelve-NE tags. This conversion is a semi-automatic process. Some of our sixteen NE tags can be automatically mapped to some of the IJCNLP-08 shared task tags. The tags that represent person, location and organization names can be directly mapped to the NEP, NEL and NEO tags, respectively. Other IJCNLP-08 shared task tags can be obtained with the help of gazetteer lists and simple heuristics. In our earlier NER experiments, we have already developed a number of gazetteer lists such as: lists of person, location and organization names; list of prefix words (e.g., sree, sriman etc.) that predict the left boundary of a person name; list of designation words (e.g., mantri, sangsad etc.) that helps to identify person names. The lists of prefix and designation words are help-ful to find the NETP and NED tags. The sixteen-NE tagged corpus is searched for the person name tags and the previous word is matched against the lists of prefix and designation words. The previous word is tagged as NED or NETP if there is a match with the lists of designation words and prefix words, respectively. The NEN and NETI tags can be obtained by looking at our miscellaneous tags and using some simple heuristics. The NEN tags can be simply obtained by checking whether the MISC tagged element consists of digits only. The lists of cardinal and ordinal numbers have been also kept to recognize NETI tags. A list of words that denote the measurements (e.g., kilogram, taka, dollar etc.) has been kept in order to get the NEM tag. The lists of words, denoting the brand names, title-objects and terms, have been prepared to get the NEB, NETO and NETE tags. The NEA tags can be obtained with the help of a gazetteer list and using some simple heuristics (whether the word contains the dot and there is no space between the characters). The mapping from our NE tagset to the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task tagset is shown in Table 8."]},{"title":"3 Use of Language Resources","paragraphs":["The NE tagged news corpus, developed in this work, has been used to develop the Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems in Bengali using pattern directed shallow parsing, HMM, ME, CRF and SVM frameworks.
