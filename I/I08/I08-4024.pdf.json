Particularly, we evaluated our word segmentation model on all the corpora, namely Academia Sinica (CKIP), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), University of Colorado (CTB), State Language Commission of P.R.C. (NCC) and Shanxi University (SXU). For POS tagging and NER tasks, our models were evaluated on CITYU corpus only. Our models for the evaulation are based on the maximum entropy approach, we concentrated on the word segmentation task for the bakeoff and our best official results on all the corpora for this task are 0.9083 F-score on CITYU, 0.8985 on CKIP, 0.9077 on CTB, 0.8995 on NCC and 0.9146 on SXU."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff, besides providing the evaluation tasks for the word segmentation and NER, it also introduced another important evaluation task, POS tagging for Chinese language. In this bakeoff, our models built for the tasks are similar to that in the work of Ng and Low (2004). The models are based on a maximum entropy framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Xue and Shen, 2003). They are trained on the corpora for the tasks from the bakeoff. To understand the model, the implementation of the models is wholly done ourselves. We used Visual Studio .NET 2003 and C++ as the implementation language. The Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) (Pietra et al., 1997) is used as the parameter estimation algorithm for the models. We tried all the closed track tests of the word segmentation, the CITYU closed track tests for POS tagging and NER."]},{"title":"2 Maximum Entropy","paragraphs":["In this bakeoff, our basic model is based on the framework described in the work of Ratnaparkhi (1996) which was applied for English POS tagging. The conditional probability model of the framework is called maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957). Maximum entropy model is a feature-based, probability model which can include arbitrary number of features that other generative models like N-gram model, hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989) cannot do. The probability model can be defined over X × Y, where X is the set of 138 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing possible histories and Y is the set of allowable futures or classes.

For the Chinese word segmenter, it is based on the work that treats Chinese word segmentation as tagging (Xue and Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004). Given a Chinese sentence, it assigns a so-called boundary tag to each Chinese character in the sentence. There are four possible boundary tags: S for a character which is a single-character word, B for a character that is the first character of a multi-character word, E for a character that is the last character of a multi-character word and M for a character that is neither the first nor last of a multi-character word. With these boundary tags, the word segmentation becomes a tagging problem where each character in Chinese sentences is given one of the boundary tags which is the most probable one according to the conditional probability calculated by the model. And then sequences of characters are converted into sequences of words according to the tags."]},{"title":"4 POS Tagger and Named Entity Recognizer","paragraphs":["For the POS tagging task, the tagger is built based on the work of Ratnaparkhi (1996) which was applied for English POS tagging. Because of the time limitation, we could only try to port our implemented maximum entropy model to this POS tagging task by using the similar feature set (discussed in Section 5) for a word-based POS tagger as in the work of Ng and Low (2004). By the way, besides porting the model to the POS tagging task, it was even tried in the NER task by using the same feature set (discussed in Section 5) as used for the word segmentation in order to test the performance of the implemented model.","The tagging algorithm for these two tasks is basically the same as used in word segmentation. Given a word or a character, the model will try to assign the most probable POS or NE tag for the word or character respectively."]},{"title":"5 Features","paragraphs":["To achieve a successful model for any task by using the maximum entropy model, an important step is to select a set of useful features for the task. In the following, the feature sets used in the tasks of the bakeoff are discussed. 5.1 Word Segmentation Features The feature set used in this task is discussed in our previous work (Leong et al., 2007) which is currently the best in our implemented model. They are the unigram features: C-2, C-1, C0, C1 and C2, bigram features: C-2C-1, C-1C0, C0C1, C1C2 and C-1C1 where C0 is the current character, Cn (C-n) is the 139 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing character at the nth","position to the right (left) of the current character. For example, given the character sequence “維多利亞港” (Victoria Harbour), while taking the character “利” as C0, then C-2 = “維”, C-1C1 = “多亞”, etc. The boundary tag (S, B, M or E) feature T-1 is also applied, i.e., the boundary tag assigned to the previous character of C0. And the last feature WC0: This feature captures the word context in which the current character is found. It has the format “W_C0”. For example, the character “利” is a character of the word “維多利亞港”. Then this will give the feature WC0 = “維多利亞港 _利”. 5.2 POS Tagging Features For this task, because of the time limitation as mentioned in the previous section, we could only port our implemented model by using a part of the feature set which was used in the word-based tagger discussed in the work of Ng and Low (2004). The feature set includes: Wn (n = -2 to 2), WnWn+1 (n = -2, -1, 0, 1), W-1W1, POS(W-2), POS(W-1), POS(W-2)POS(W-1) where W refers to a word, POS refers to the POS assigned to the word and n refers to the position of the current word being considered. For example, while considering this sentence taken from the POS tagged corpus of CITYU: “香港/Ng 特別/Ac 行政區/Nc 正式/Dc 成立 /Vt” (Hong Kong S.A.R. is established), taking “行 政區” as W0, then W-2 = “香港”, W-1W1 = “特別 正 式”, POS(W-2) = “Ng”, POS(W-2)POS(W-1) = “Ac Dc”, etc. 5.3 Named Entity Recognition Features For the NER task, we directly used the same feature set as for the word segmentation basically. However, because the original NE tagged corpus is presented in two-column format, where the first column consists of the character and the second is a tag, a transformation which is to transform the original corpus to a sentence per line format before collecting the features or other training data is needed. This transformation actually continues to read the lines from the original corpus, whenever a blank line is found, a sentence of characters with NE tags can be formed.","After that, the features collected are the unigram features: C-2, C-1, C0, C1 and C2, bigram features: C-2C-1, C-1C0, C0C1, C1C2 and C-1C1, NE tag features: T-1, WC0 (this feature captures the NE context in which the current character is found) where T-1 refers to the NE tag assigned to the previous character of C0, W refers to the named entity. So similar to the explanation of features of word segmentation, for example, given the sequence from the NER tagged corpus of CITYU: “一/N 個/N 中 /B-LOC 國 /I-LOC 人 /N” (One Chinese), while taking the character “中” as C0, then C-2 = “一”, C-1C1 = “個國”, WC0 = “中國_中”, etc.","For all the experiments conducted, training was done with a feature cutoff of 1."]},{"title":"6 Testing","paragraphs":["For word segmentation task, during testing, given a character sequence C1 ... Cn, the trained model will try to assign a boundary tag to each character in the sequence based on the probability of the boundary tag calculated. Then the sequence of characters is converted into sequence of words according to the tag sequence t1 ... tn. But if each character was just assigned the boundary tag with the highest probability, invalid boundary tag sequences would be produced and wrong word segmentation results would be obtained. In particular, known words that are in the dictionary of the training corpus are segmented wrongly because of these invalid tag sequences. In order to correct these, the invalid boundary tag sequences are collected, such as for two-character words, they are “B B”, “B S”, “M S”, “E E”, etc., for three-character words, they are “B E S”, “B M S”, etc., and for four-character words, they are “B M M S”, “S M M E”, etc. With these invalid boundary tag sequences, some post correction to the word segmentation result can be tried. That is after the model tagger has done the tagging for a Chinese sentence every time, the invalid boundary tag sequences will be searched within the preliminary result given by the tagger. When the invalid boundary tag sequence is found, the characters corresponding to that invalid boundary tag sequence will be obtained. After, the word formed by these characters is looked up to see if it is indeed a word in the dictionary, if it is, then the correction is carried out.","Another kind of post correction to the word segmentation result is to make some guessed correction for some invalid boundary tag sequences such as “B S”, “S E”, “B B”, “E E”, “B M S”, etc. That is, whenever those tag sequences are met 140 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing within the preliminary result given by the model tagger, they will be corrected no matter if there is word in the dictionary formed by the characters corresponding to the invalid boundary tag sequence.","We believe that similar post correction can be applied to the NER task. For example, if such NE tag sequences “B-PER N”, “N I-PER N”, etc. occur in the result, then the characters corresponding to the invalid NE tag sequence can be obtained again and looked up in the named entity dictionary to see if they really form a named entity. However, we did not have enough time to adapt this for the NER task finally. Therefore, no such post correction was applied for the NER task in this bakeoff finally."]},{"title":"7 Evaluation Results","paragraphs":["We evaluated our models in the closed tracks of the word segmentation, part of speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER) tasks. Particularly, our word segmentation model was evaluated on all the corpora, namely Academia Sinica (CKIP), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), University of Colorado (CTB), State Language Commission of P.R.C. (NCC) and Shanxi University (SXU). For POS tagging and NER tasks, our models were evaluated on the CITYU corpus only. Table 1 shows our official results for the word segmentation task in the bakeoff.

Official Results in the Closed Tracks of","the Word Segmentation Task on all Corpora","","We submitted a few runs for each of the tests of","the corpora. Table 1 shows the best two runs for","each of the tests of the corpora for discussion here. The run (a) applied only the post correction to the known words that are in the dictionary of the training corpus but are segmented wrongly because of the invalid boundary tag sequences. The run (b) applied also the guessed post correction for some invalid boundary tag sequences in the results as mentioned in Section 6. From the results above, it can be seen that the runs with the guessed post correction generally gave a little bit better performance than those that did not apply. This shows that the guess somehow made some good guesses for some unknown words that appear in the testing corpora.","Table 2 shows our official results for the POS tagging task. The columns A shows the accuracy. The columns IV-R, OOV-R and MT-R show the recall on in-vocabulary words, out-of-vocabulary words and multi-POS words (multi-POS words are the words in the training corpus and have more than one POS-tag in either the training corpus or testing corpus) respectively. The run (a) used the paramters set which was observed to be the optimal ones for the model in the training phase. The run (b) used the parameters set of the model in the last iteration of the training phase."," Run_ID A IV-R OOV-R MT-R cityu_a 0.1890 0.2031 0.0550 0.1704 cityu_b 0.2793 0.2969 0.1051 0.2538 Table 2. Official Results in the Closed Track of the POS Tagging Task on the CITYU Corpus","","It can be seen that our results were unexpectedly low in accuracy. After releasing the results, we found that the problem was due to the encoding problem of our submitted result files. The problem probably occurred after the conversion from our Big5 encoded results to the UTF-16 encoded results which are required by the bakeoff. Therefore, we did the evaluation ourselves by running our POS tagger again, using the official evaluation program and the truth test set. Finally, our best result was 0.7436 in terms of accuracy but this was still far lower than the baseline (0.8425) of the CITYU corpus. This shows that the direct porting of English word-based POS tagging to Chinese is not effective.","Table 3 shows our official results for the NER task. The columns R, P and F show the recall, precision and F-score respectively. Again, similar to the POS tagging task, the run (a) used the 141 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing paramters set which was observed to be the optimal ones for the model in the training phase. The run (b) used the parameters set of the model in the last iteration of the training phase.","","Run_ID R P F","cityu_a 0.0874 0.1058 0.0957","cityu_b 0.0211 0.0326 0.0256 Table 3. Official Results in the Closed Track of the NER Task on the CITYU Corpus","","It can be seen that our results were again unexpectedly low in accuracy. The cause of such low accuracy results was due to parts of the wrong format of the submitted result files compared with the correct format of the result file. So like the POS tagging task, we did the evaluation ourselves by running our NE recognizer again. Finally, our best result was 0.5198 in terms of F-score but this was again far lower than the baseline (0.5955) of the CITYU corpus. This shows that the similar feature set for the word segmentation task is not effective for the NER task."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper reports the use of maximum entropy approach for implementing models for the three tasks in the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff and our results in the bakeoff.
