Comparing with the previous work, the difference of our approach is that the employed features are obtained not only from the sentence level, but also from the segment level. In our approach, the semi-Markov CRF model is employed for segment labeling. The preliminary experiments have shown that the approach does outperform all other traditional supervised and unsupervised approaches to document summarization."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Document summarization has been a rapidly evolving subfield of Information Retrieval (IR) since (Luhn, 1958). A summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts and conveys important information of the original text(s). Usually it is no longer than half of the original text(s) or, significantly less (Radev et al., 2002). Recently, many evaluation competitions (like the Document Understanding Conference DUC “http://duc.nist.gov”, in the style of NIST’s TREC), provided some sets of training corpus. It is obvious that, in the age of information explosion, document summarization will be greatly helpful to the internet users; besides, the techniques it uses can also find their applications in speech techniques and multimedia document retrieval, etc.","The approach to summarizing can be categorized in many ways. Some of them are: 1) indicative, informative and evaluative, according to functionality; 2) single-document and multi-document, according to the amount of input documents; 3) generic and query-oriented, according to applications. Yet the taxonomy currently widely employed is to categorize summarization into abstractive and extractive.","According to (Radev et al., 2002), all methods that are not explicitly extractive are categorized as abstractive. These approaches include ontological information, information fusion, and compression. Abstract-based summarization never goes beyond conceptual stage, though ever since the dawn of summarization it has been argued as an alternative for its extract-based counterpart. On the other hand, extractive summarization is still attracting a lot of researchers (Yeh et al., 2005) (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006) and many practical systems, say, MEAD “http://www.summarization.com/mead/”, have been produced. Using supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms to extract sentences is currently the mainstream of the extractive summarization. However, all pervious methods focus on obtaining features from the sentence granularity.","In this paper we focus on generating summarization by using a supervised extractive approach in which the features are obtained from a larger granularity, namely segment. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work concerning the extract-based summarization. Section 3 describes our motivations. Our experiments and results are given in Section 4, and Section 5 draws the conclusion and mentions the future work."]},{"title":"126 2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Early researchers approached the summarization problem by scoring each sentence with a combination of the features like word frequency and distribution, some proper names (Luhn, 1958), sentence positions in a paragraph (Baxendale, 1958), and sentence similarity (Gong, 2001) etc. The results were comparatively good. Most supervised extractive methods nowadays focus on finding powerful machine learning algorithms that can properly combine these features.","Bayesian classifier was first applied to summarization by (Pedersen and Chen, 1995), the authors claimed that the corpus-trained feature weights were in agreement with (Edmundson, 1969), which employed a subjective combination of weighted features. Another usage of the naïve Bayesian model in summarization can be found in (Aone et al., 1997). Bayesian model treats each sentence individually, and misses the intrinsic connection between the sentences. (Yeh et al., 2005) employed genetic algorithm to calculate the belief or score of each sentence belonging to the summary, but it also bears this shortcoming.","To overcome this independence defect, (Conroy and O’leary, 2001) pioneered in deeming this problem as a sequence labeling problem. The authors used HMM, which has fewer independent assumptions. However, HMM can not handle the rich linguistic features among the sentences either. Recently, as CRF (Lafferty and McCallum, 2001) has been proved to be successful in part-of-speech tagging and other sequence labeling problems, (Shen et al., 2007) attempted to employ this model in document summarization. CRF can leverage all those features despite their dependencies, and absorb other summary system’s outcome. By introducing proper features and making a comparison with SVM, HMM, etc., (Shen et al., 2007) claimed that CRF could achieve the best performance.","All these approaches above share the same viewpoint that features should be obtained at sentence level. Nevertheless, it can be easily seen that the non-summary or summary sentences tend to appear in a consecutive manner, namely, in segments. These rich features of segments can surely not be managed by those traditional methods.","Recently, Sequence Segmentation Model (SSM) has attracted more and more attention in some traditional sequence learning tasks. SSM builds a direct path to encapsulate the rich segmental features (e.g., entity length and the similarity with other entities, etc., in entity recognition). Semi-CRF (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) is one of the SSMs, and generally outperforms CRF."]},{"title":"3 Motivations","paragraphs":["According to the analysis in Section 2, our basic idea is clear that we regard the supervised summarizing as a problem of sequence segmentation. However, in our approach, the features are not only obtained on the sentence level but also on the segment level.","Here a segment means one or more sentences sharing the same label (namely, non-summary or summary), and a text is regarded as a sequence of segments. Semi-CRF is a qualified model to accomplish the task of segment labeling, besides it shares all the virtues of CRF. Using semi-CRF, we can easily leverage the features both in traditional sentence level and in the segment level. Some features, like Log Likelihood or Similarity, if obtained from each sentence, are inclined to give unexpected results due to the small granularity. Furthermore, semi-CRF is a generalized version of CRF. The features designed for CRF can be used in semi-CRF directly, and it has been proved that semi-CRF outperforms CRF in some Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).","In the subsections below, we first introduce semi-CRF then describe the features we used in our approach. 3.1 Semi-CRF CRF was first introduced in (Lafferty and McCallum, 2001). It is a conditional model P(Y|X), and here both X and Y may have complex structure. The most prominent merits of CRF are that it offers relaxation of the strong independence assumptions made in HMM or Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM) (McCallum, 2000) and it is no victim of the label bias problem. Semi-CRF is a generalization version of sequential CRF. It extends CRF by allowing each state to persist for a non-unit length of time. After this time has elapsed, the system might transmit to a new state, which only depends on its previous one. When the system is in the “segment of time”, it is allowed to behave non-Markovianly."]},{"title":"127 3.1.1 CRF vs. Semi-CRF","paragraphs":["Given an observed sentence sequence X=(x1,x2,...,xM).

The basic aim of DUC 2001 is to further progress of summarization and enable researchers to participate into large-scale experiments. The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts, each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not. Because in (Shen et al. 2007) all the experiments were conducted upon DUC2001, we may make a comparison between the sequence labeling models and the sequence segmentation modes we used. The only preprocessing we did is to remove some stop words according to a stop word list. We use F1 score as the evaluation criteria which is defined as: 2*Precesion*Recall 1 Precesion+RecallF = (10) We used 10-fold cross validation in order to reduce the uncertainty of the model we trained. The final F1 score reported is the average of all these 10 experiments.","All those steps above are strictly identical to the work in (Shen et al. 2007), and its result is taken as our baseline. 4.2 Results & Analysis As we mentioned in Sub-Section 3.2, those extended version of features only work when segment length is bigger than one. So, each of these extended version of features or their combination can be used together with all the other regular features listed in the right column in Table 1. In order to give a complete test of the capacity of all these extended features and their combinations, we do the experiments according to the power set of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (the numbers are the IDs of these extended features as listed in Table 1), that is we need to do the test 25","-1 times with different combinations of the extended features.
