When a query (e.g. “jaguar”) is ambiguous, the search results are inevitably mixed in content (e.g. containing documents on the jaguar cat and on the jaguar car), which is certainly non-optimal for a given user, who is burdened by having to sift through the mixed results. In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user. The major goal of personalized search is to accurately model a user’s information need and store it in the user profile and then re-rank the results to suit to the user’s interests using the user profile. However, understanding a user’s information need is, unfortunately, a very difficult task partly because it is difficult to model the search process which is a cognitive process and partly because it is difficult to characterize a user and his preferences and goals. Indeed, this has been recognized as a major challenge in information retrieval research (et. al, 2003).","In order to address the problem of personalization one needs to clearly understand the actual process of search. First the user has an information need that he would like to fulfill. He is the only entity in the process that knows the exact information he needs and also has a vague notion of the document that can full fill his specific information need. A query based search engine is at his disposal for identifying this particular document or set of documents from among a vast repository of them. He then formulates a query that he thinks is congruent to the document he imagines to fulfill his need and poses it to the search engine. The search engine now returns"]},{"title":"521","paragraphs":["a list of results that it calculates as relevant according to its ranking algorithm. Every user is different and has a different information need, perhaps over-lapping sometimes. The way a user conceives an ideal document that fulfills his need also varies. It is our hypothesis that if one can learn the variations of each user in this direction, effective personalization can be done.","Most approaches to personalization have tried to model the user’s interests by requesting explicit feedback from the user during the search process and observing these relevance judgments to model the user’s interests. This is called relevance feedback, and personalization techniques using it have been proven to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy (Salton and Buckley, 1990; Rocchio, 1971). These approaches to personalization have considered, user profile to be a collection of words, ontology, a matrix etc.","We use relevance feedback for personalization in our approach. However we propose a novel usage of relevance feedback to effectively model the process of query formulation and better characterize how a user relates his query to the document that he intends to retrieve as discussed in the web search process above. A user profile learnt from the relevance feedback that captures the query generation process is used as a guide to understand user’s interests over time and personalize his web search results.","Interestingly, a new paradigm has been proposed for retrieval rooted from statistical language modeling recently that views the query generation process through a Noisy channel model (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) . It was assumed that the document and query are from different languages and the query generation process was viewed as a translation from the document language which is more verbose to the language of the query which is more compact and brief. The noisy channel model proposed by Berger and Lafferty (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) inherently captures the dependencies between the query and document words by learning a translation model between them. As we intend to achieve personalized search by personalizing the query formulation process, we also perceive the user profile learning through a Noisy Channel Model. In the model, when a user has an information need, he also has an ideal document in mind that fulfills his need. The user tries to in a way translate the notion of the ideal document into a query that is more compact but congruent to the document. He then poses this query to the search engine and retrieves the results. By observing this above process over time, we can capture how the user is generating a query from his ideal document. By learning this model of a user, we can predict which document best describes his information need for the query he poses. This is the motive of personalization. In our approach, we learn a user model which is probabilistic model for the noisy channel using statistical translation approaches and from the past queries and their corresponding relevant documents provided as feedback by the user.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe the related work on personalized search then we provide the background and the framework that our approach is based upon. we discuss the modeling of a user profile as a translation model. after which we describe applying it to personalized search. we describe our experimental results followed by conclusions with directions to some future work."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been a growing literature available with regard to personalization of search results.

It assumes that the user has a reasonable idea of the terms that are likely to appear in the ideal document that can satisfy his/her information need, and that the query terms the user chooses can distinguish the ideal document from the rest of the collection. The query is thus generated as the piece of text representative of the ideal document. The task of the system is then to estimate, for each of the documents in the collection, which is most likely to be the ideal document.","arg max D","P (D|Q) = arg max D P (Q|D)P (D) where Q is a query and D is a document. The prior probability P (D) is usually assumed to be uniform and a language model P (Q|D) is estimated for every document. In other words, they estimate a probability distribution over words for each document and calculate the probability that the query is a sample from that distribution. Documents are ranked according to this probability. The basic model has been extended in a variety of ways. Modeling documents as in terms of a noisy channel model by Berger & Lafferty (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), mixture of topics, and phrases are considered (Song and Croft., 1999), (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) explicitly models relevance, and a risk minimization framework based on Bayesian decision theory has been developed (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).","The noisy channel by Berger and Lafferty (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) view a query as a distilla-tion or translation from a document describing the query generation process in terms of a noisy channel model. In formulating a query to a retrieval system, a user begins with an information need. This information need is then represented as a fragment of an “ideal document”, a portion of the type of document that the user hopes to receive from the system. The user then translates or “distills” this ideal document fragment into a succinct query, selecting key terms and replacing some terms with related terms.","To determine the relevance of a document to a query, their model estimates the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of that document. Documents are then ranked according to these probabilities. More specifically, the mapping from a document term w to a query term qi is achieved by estimating translation models P (q|w). Using translation models, the retrieval model becomes P (Q|D) = ∏ q i∈Q αP (qi|GE) + (1 − α) ∑ w∈D P (qi|w)P (w|D)","where P (qi|GE) is the smoothed or general probability obtained from a large general corpus. P (qi|w) is an entry in the translation model. It represents the probability of generation of the query word qi for a word w in the document. P (w|D) is the probability of the word w in the document and α is a weighting parameter which lies between 0 and 1."]},{"title":"4 User Profile as a Translation Model","paragraphs":["We perceive the user profile learning as learning the channel probabilities of a Noisy Channel Model that generates the query from the document.

By learning this, we can predict which document best describes his information need. The learnt model, called a user profile, is thus capable of personalizing results for that particular user. Hence, the user profile here is a translation model learnt from explicit feedback of the user using statistical translation approaches. Explicit feedback consists of the past queries and their corresponding relevant documents provided as feedback by the user. A translation model is a probabilistic model consisting of the triples, the source word, the target word and the probability of translation. The translation model here is between document words and queries words. Therefore the user profile as a translation model in our approach will consist of triples of a document word, a query word and the probability of the document word generating the query word."]},{"title":"5 Personalized Search","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe how we perform personalized search using the proposed translation model based user profile. First, a user profile is learnt using the translation model process then the re-ranking is done using the learnt user profile. 5.1 Learning user profile In our approach, a user profile consists of a statistical translation model. A translation model is a probabilistic model consisting of the triples, the source word, the target word and the probability of translation. Our user profiles consists of the following triples, a document word, a query word and the probability of the document word generating the query word.","Consider a user u, let { {Qi, Di}, i = 1, 2, ..., N } represent the past history of the user u. where Qi is the query and Di is the concatenation of all the relevant documents for the query Qi and let Di = {w1, w2, ..., wn} be the words in it. The user profile learnt from the past history of user consists of the following triples of the form (q, wi, p(q|wi)) where q is a word in the query Qi and wi is a word in the document Di.","Translation model is typically learnt from parallel texts i.e a set of translation pairs consisting of source and target language sentences. In learning the user profile, we first extract parallel texts from the past history of the user and then learn the translation model which is essentially the user profile. In the subsections below, we describe the process in detail. 5.1.1 Extracting Parallel Texts","By viewing documents as samples of a verbose language and the queries as samples of a concise language, we can treat each document-query pair as a translation pair, i.e. a pair of texts written in the verbose language and the concise language respectively. The extracted parallel texts consists of pairs of the form {Qi, Drel} where Drel is the concatenation of contexts extracted from all relevant document for the query Qi.","We believe that short snippets extracted in the context of the query would be better candidates for Drel than using the whole document. This is because there can be a lot of noisy terms which need not right in the context of the query. We believe a short snippet usually N (we considered 15) words to the left and right of the query words, similar to a short snippet displayed by search engines can better capture the context of the query. In deed we experimented with different context sizes for Drel. The first is using the whole document i.e., considering the query and concatenation of all the relevant documents as a pair in the parallel texts extracted which is called Ddocuments The second is using just a short text snippet from the document in the context of query instead of the whole document which is called Dsnippets Details are described in the experiments section. 5.1.2 Learning Translation Model","According to the standard statistical translation model (Brown et al., 1993), we can find the optimal model M ∗","by maximizing the probability of generating queries from documents or","M ∗ = arg max","M N ∏ i=1 P (Qi|Di, M )"]},{"title":"524 qw dw P(qw","paragraphs":["|dw,u) journal kdd 0.0176 journal conference 0.0123 journal journal 0.0176 journal sigkdd 0.0088 journal discovery 0.0211 journal mining 0.0017 journal acm 0.0088 music music 0.0375 music purchase 0.0090 music mp3 0.0090 music listen 0.0180 music mp3.com 0.0450 music free 0.0008 Table 1: Sample user profile To find the optimal word translation probabilities P (qw|dw, M ∗), we can use the EM algorithm.

Each user submitted a number of queries to a search engine (Google). For each query, the user examined the top 10 documents and identified the set of relevant documents. Table 2 gives the statistics of the data sets. There is no repetition of query for any user though repetition of some words in the query exists (see Table 2). The document collection consists of top 20 documents from google which is actually the set of documents seen by the user while accessing the relevance of the documents. In all, the total size of the document collection was 3,469 documents. We did not include documents of type doc and pdf files.","To evaluate our approach, we use the 10-fold cross-validation strategy (Mitchell, 1997). We divide the data of each user into 10 sets each having (approximately) equal number of search queries (For example, for user1 had 37 queries in total, we divided this into 10 sets with 4 queries each approximately). Learning of user profile is done 10 times, each time leaving out one of the sets from training, but using only the omitted subset for testing. Performance is computed in the testing phase for each time and average of the 10 times is taken. In the testing phase, we take each query and re rank the results using the proposed approach using his profile learned from nine other sets. For measuring performance for each query, we compute Precision @10 (P@10), a widely used metric for evaluating personalized search algorithms. It is defined as the proportion of relevant documents among the top 10 results for the given ranking of documents. P@10 is computed by comparing with the relevant documents present in the data.
