Some of them are spoken by a tens or hundreds of millions of people, so they will probably be supported in the near future. However, many languages may not be, simply because the number of people using them on computers, for whatever reason, is not large. Those who want to use these languages on computers, includ-ing the researchers working on those languages, will need support for these languages. A related problem is that of support for encodings, as many of these less computerized languages do not have one standard encoding that is used by all. Therefore, there is a need of a simple and easily customizable method of adding support for a new language or encoding. Such a method should require minimum technical knowledge from the user. In this paper, we will present a method of providing language and encoding support for less computerized languages.","Another need which we address in this paper is of an editor that not only makes use of the above mentioned method of language and encoding support, but also has many facilities useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers and linguists."]},{"title":"2 Language-Encoding Support","paragraphs":["There is no exhaustive, commonly agreed upon list of encodings for many languages. Even the list of languages is not without dispute (e.g., whether Bhojpuri is a language or not). This implies that the conventional deterministic approach to language-encoding support based on the assumption that the possible languages and encodings are known in advance is not enough if we do not want to prevent the possibility of using any language or encoding used by a significant number of people, or even a rarely used endangered language.","Even though with the increasing use of Unicode based encodings, the problem has reduced for many languages, we still require a facility that can allow convenient use of new languages which are not covered in Unicode.","Therefore, what we need is a more customizable language-encoding support where it is very easy for the user or the developer to add support for some language-encoding. For this purpose, as many of the tasks should be automated as possible. This can be done by using NLP techniques. Even though many of the encodings used for less computerized languages are based on just font mappings, i.e., supporting them basically means providing an appropri-"]},{"title":"957","paragraphs":["Figure 1: A customizable design for language-encoding support ate font. This seems to be very simple, but the problem is that the user may not know which font to use. Moreover, providing basic support so that you can type once you have selected the font is not enough. The user might not even know what encoding some existing text is in. Then, the user might want to save the text in some other encoding. To provide user friendly support for language-encodings in a situation like this requires a more intelligent design.","Figure-1 shows a design for language-encoding support which addresses these problems. The main elements of this design are:","• Properties files listing languages, encodings, fonts, and their connections • Language-encoding identification for text • Language-encoding identification for fonts • A language-encoding API • Encoding converters","Currently, 15 languages and 10 encoding are supported. These are mostly all South Asian languages, apart from English, since the users till now were mostly from South Asia. A large number of freely available fonts have also been included in the distribution, but the user would probably like to add more fonts, which can be done easily just by adding the paths of the new fonts in a properties file. There is no need to install these fonts, irrespective of the operating systems. Also, more languages and encodings can be added quite easily. In most cases, to add a new language-encoding, the user just has to follow these steps:","1. Make a new entry in the properties files for each of these three: languages, encodings and language-encodings.","2. Specify the paths of all the fonts for that language-encoding in the properties file for fonts. These fonts just have to be on the system and their paths have to specified in the properties file. However, it may be preferable (for convenience) that they be stored in fonts directory of Sanchay.","3. Specify the default font in the properties file for default fonts.","4. If the new language uses a Unicode encoding, make an entry for the Unicode block corre-"]},{"title":"958","paragraphs":["Figure 2: A font chooser listing fonts relevant to a specific language encoding pair sponding to that language. This is not compulsory, but it will allow language specific listing of fonts for language-encoding pairs involving Unicode encodings.","In future, we will make this even more easy by providing a graphic user interface based wizard to go through these steps.","The editor can also use any input methods available from the operating system. New input methods can also be added as Java libraries. Such external Java libraries have just to be copied to the extlib directory of Sanchay. It is also possible to easily switch among input methods (Figure-4), whether provided by the operating system or included into (or add to) Sanchay. So, it is possible to enter text in multiple languages.","Note that, right now, this support for language-encodings is in the form of an extra platform independent layer on top of the support provided by operating systems. Such a layer could possibly be integrated into operating systems in future. This might, of course, require porting of the code for different operating systems and can be in-built into the operating system. 2.1 A More Intelligent Listing of Fonts In the design used on all operating systems so far, when you want to view the list of fonts, what you get is a list of all the fonts installed on the system or at least all the fonts found by the operating system or the user program. This is not very user friendly for less computerized languages, because most of the fonts listed may not be meant for the language-encoding the user is interested in. What the user needs is the list of fonts relevant to the specific language-encoding she is interested in. In our design, this is what the user will see (Figure-2), when the user views the list of fonts. Of course, we can also give the user the option to see all the fonts installed on the system. 2.2 Language-Encoding Identification Another important element of the design is a language-encoding identification tool that is integrated into the language-encoding support module so that if the user opens a file and does not know the language or encoding of the text, the tool can automatically identify the language-encoding of the text. The language-encoding identification tool is based on byte based n-gram models using a distributional similarity measures (Singh, 2006a). This tools is computationally quite a light one as the amount of"]},{"title":"959","paragraphs":["data required for training is very small and it has been found to be one of the most accurate language-encoding systems currently available. The user can make it even faster by removing those language-encodings which she may not be interested in. This will require only a change in the relevant properties file. 2.3 Encoding Conversion There is also a wrapper module for calling any installed or built in encoding converter for languages which use more than one encodings. The user can easily convert the encoding of the text depending on her needs and the availability of a relevant encoding converter. It is also possible to easily add new encoding converters."]},{"title":"3 Sanchay Editor","paragraphs":["Although numerous text editors, even free and open source ones, are available, the simple open source editor that we are going to describe in this section (Figure-3) is based on the language-encoding support mentioned earlier and is also closely integrated with Sanchay1",", a collection of tools and APIs for NLP. The editor is implemented as a customizable GUI component that can be easily included in any Java application. The notable features of this editor are: - Uses customizable language-encoding support as described earlier. - Can automatically identify language-encoding of the text using a byte based n-gram modeling (Singh, 2006a). - The font chooser (Figure-2) shows only the fonts applicable for the language-encoding. - Text can be preprocessed for NLP or annotation purposes from this editor. - The formats used for annotation can be detected and validated from the editor. - Specialized annotation interfaces can be launched to edit the annotated files (in text format) opened in this editor. - Since the editor is implemented in Java, it can be used on any platform on which Java (JRE or JDK version 1.5 or higher) is installed. 1 http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/anil/Sanchay-EILMT and http://source","forge.net/projects/nlp-sanchay","Some of the facilities are described in the follow-ing sub-sections. 3.1 Validation of Annotation Formats If the user is directly editing a document which is annotated with POS tags, chunks or is syntactically annotated, it is possible to automatically validate the annotation format of the document. A text box be-low the main editing panel shows the errors in format, if any. Usually, annotation is performed by using some annotation interface, but since the annotated data is stored as simple text, the document can be edited or annotated directly from a text editor. The format validation facility has been included to ensure that after any such editing or annotation, the document is still in the correct format, as it is easy for users to make format related mistakes. 3.2 Format Conversion Sanchay annotation interfaces allow annotation at various levels like POS tagging, chunking, syntactic (treebank) annotation etc. Currently four different formats are recognized by the system: raw text without annotation, POS tagged format where each sentence is simply a sequence of word and POS tag pairs separated by some symbol like underscore, ‘bracket form’ which allows POS tagged and chunked data to be represented (including recursion), and Shakti Standard Format (SSF)2",". The editor allows the user to convert the data from one format to another. 3.3 Document Statistics The user can also get a statistics about the document, such as the number of words, the number of sentences, the number of characters, and their respective frequencies etc. These statistics are according to the format of the document, i.e., if the document is in SSF format, then the document will be parsed and the statistics will be about the annotated document and the elements of the format, e.g. <Sentence> tag will not be counted: only actual words (or POS tags etc.) in the annotated document will be counted. Such statistics can also be obtained for a number of documents, i.e., a corpus, not just the current document. This can be a very useful facility for working on annotated corpus.","2","www.elda.org/en/proj/scalla/SCALLA2004/sangalsharma.pdf"]},{"title":"960","paragraphs":["Figure 3: A multipurpose editor for NLP for South Asian languages Figure 4: Input methods currently supported"]},{"title":"961 3.4 Integration with Annotations Interfaces","paragraphs":["The editor is built into Sanchay in such a way that it is possible to open different views of a document, depending on the annotation format. For example, if the currently opened document is in SSF format, then the same document can be opened in the Sanchay Syntactic Annotation Interface just by clicking on a button or a context menu item. The opposite is also possible, i.e., if a document is open in the Syntactic Annotation Interface, then it can be directly opened into the Sanchay Editor as a simple text file. 3.5 Some Other Facilities Apart from the above mentioned facilities, Sanchay Editor also has the usual facilities available in text editors such as find and replace (with regular expressions and also in the batch mode), reverting to the saved version, automatic periodic backup etc."]},{"title":"4 Facilities Being Integrated","paragraphs":["Some other facilities that have already been implemented and are going to be integrated into the Sanchay Editor include a better spell checker for South Asian languages based on a Computational Phonetic Model of Scripts or CPMS (Singh, 2006b). This model provides a method to calculate the phonetic and orthographic similarity (surface similarity) of words or strings. Another facility is the identification of languages and encoding in a multilingual document (Singh and Gorla, 2007a). This is an extension of the language-encoding identification tools described earlier and is the first systematic work on the problem of identification of languages and encoding in a multilingual document. When this tool is integrated into the editor, the user will be able to open a multilingual document and the system will automatically identify the sections in different languages and display them accordingly, even if the document has not been encoded using Unicode. Of course, identification is not 100% accurate at present, but we are working on improving it. Another already implemented facility that is going to be added is fuzzy text search (Singh et al., 2007c). It is also mainly based on the idea of calculating surface similarity using the CPMS. Fuzzy text search based on this method performs better than the traditional methods. Yet another facility to be added is a more discerning mechanism for transliteration (Surana and Singh, 2008). The first important idea in this mechanism is to use different methods for transliteration based on the word origin (identified using a modified version of the language-encoding tool). The second major idea is to use fuzzy text matching for selecting the best match. This method also has outperformed other methods.","There is a plan to extend the editor to allow direct annotation. We will begin by providing support for discourse annotation and other similar annotations."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper we presented a simple but effective method of providing an easily customizable extra layer of language-encoding support for less computerized languages.
