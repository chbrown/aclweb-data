Bush” with “the president of the United States” via his relationship with “the United States”.","During the last decade, many methods have been proposed in relation extraction, such as supervised learning (Miller et al 2000; Zelenko et al 2003; Culota and Sorensen 2004; Zhao and Grishman 2005; Zhang et al 2006; Zhou et al 2005, 2006), semi-supervised learning (Brin 1998; Agichtein and Gravano 2000; Zhang 2004; Chen et al 2006), and unsupervised learning (Hasegawa et al 2004; Zhang et al 2005). Among these methods, supervised learning-based methods perform much better than the other two alternatives. However, their performance much depends on the availability of a large amount of manually labeled data and it is normally difficult to adapt an existing system to other applications and domains. On the other hand, unsupervised learning-based methods do not need the definition of relation types and the availability of manually labeled data. However, they fail to classify exact relation types between two entities and their performance is normally very low. To achieve better portability and balance between human efforts and performance, semi-supervised learning has drawn more and more attention recently in relation extraction and other NLP applications.","This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning method for relation extraction. Given a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, our proposed method first bootstraps a moderate number of weighted support vectors from all the available data via SVM using a co-training procedure with random feature projection and then applies a label propagation (LP) algorithm to capture the manifold structure in both the labeled and unlabeled data via the bootstrapped support vectors. Compared with previous methods, our method can integrate the advantages of both SVM bootstrapping in learning critical instances for the labeling function and label propagation in capturing the manifold structure in both the labeled and unlabeled data to smooth the labeling function.","The rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review related semi-supervised learning work in relation extraction. Then, the LP algorithm via bootstrapped support vectors is proposed in Section 3 while Section 4 shows the experimental results. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Generally, supervised learning is preferable to unsupervised learning due to prior knowledge in the"]},{"title":"32","paragraphs":["annotated training data and better performance. However, the annotated data is usually expensive to obtain. Hence, there has been growing interest in semi-supervised learning, aiming at inducing classifiers by leveraging a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Related work in relation extraction using semi-supervised learning can be classified into two categories: bootstrapping-based (Brin 1998; Agichtein and Gravano 2000; Zhang 2004) and label propagation(LP)-based (Chen et al 2006).","Currently, bootstrapping-based methods dominate semi-supervised learning in relation extraction. Bootstrapping works by iteratively classifying unlabeled instances and adding confidently classified ones into labeled data using a model learned from augmented labeled data in previous iteration. Brin (1998) proposed a bootstrapping-based method on the top of a self-developed pattern matching-based classifier to exploit the duality between patterns and relations. Agichtein and Gravano (2000) shared much in common with Brin (1998). They employed an existing pattern matching-based classifier (i.e. SNoW) instead. Zhang (2004) approached the much simpler relation classification sub-task by bootstrapping on the top of SVM. Although bootstrapping-based methods have achieved certain success, one problem is that they may not be able to well capture the manifold structure among unlabeled data.","As an alternative to the bootstrapping-based methods, Chen et al (2006) employed a LP-based method in relation extraction. Compared with bootstrapping, the LP algorithm can effectively combine labeled data with unlabeled data in the learning process by exploiting the manifold structure (e.g. the natural clustering structure) in both the labeled and unlabeled data. The rationale behind this algorithm is that the instances in highdensity areas tend to carry the same labels. The LP algorithm has also been successfully applied in other NLP applications, such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al 2005), text classification (Szummer and Jaakkola 2001; Blum and Chawla 2001; Belkin and Niyogi 2002; Zhu and Ghahramani 2002; Zhu et al 2003; Blum et al 2004), and information retrieval (Yang et al 2006). However, one problem is its computational burden, especially when a large amount of labeled and unlabeled data is taken into consideration.","In order to take the advantages of both bootstrapping and label propagation, our proposed method propagates labels via bootstrapped support vectors. On the one hand, our method can well capture the manifold structure in both the labeled and unlabeled data. On the other hand, our method can largely reduce the computational burden in the normal LP algorithm via all the available data."]},{"title":"3 Label Propagation via Bootstrapped Support Vectors","paragraphs":["The idea behind our LP algorithm via bootstrapped support vectors is that, instead of propagating labels through all the available labeled data, our method propagates labels through critical instances in both the labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we use SVM as the underlying classifier to bootstrap a moderate number of weighted support vectors for this purpose. This is based on an as-sumption that the manifold structure in both the labeled and unlabeled data can be well preserved through the critical instances (i.e. the weighted support vectors bootstrapped from all the available labeled and unlabeled data). The reason why we choose SVM is that it represents the state-of-the-art in machine learning research and there are good implementations of the algorithm available. In particular, SVMLight (Joachims 1998) is selected as our classifier. For efficiency, we apply the one vs. others strategy, which builds K classifiers so as to separate one class from all others. Another reason is that we can adopt the weighted support vectors returned by the bootstrapped SVMs as the critical instances, via which label propagation is done. 3.1 Bootstrapping Support Vectors This paper modifies the SVM bootstrapping algorithm BootProject(Zhang 2004) to bootstrap support vectors. Given a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, the modified BootProject algorithm bootstraps on the top of SVM by iteratively classifying unlabeled instances and moving confidently classified ones into labeled data using a model learned from the augmented labeled data in previous iteration, until not enough unlabeled instances can be classified confidently. Figure 1 shows the modified BootProject algorithm for bootstrapping support vectors.

In this paper, feature views with random feature projection, as proposed in Zhang (2004), are explored. Section 4 will discuss this issue in more details. During the iterative training process, classifiers trained on the augmented labeled data using the projected views are then asked to vote on the remaining unlabeled instances and those with the highest probability of being correctly labeled are chosen to augment the labeled data.","During the bootstrapping process, the support vectors included in all the trained SVM classifiers (for all the relation (sub)types and the non-relation) are bootstrapped (i.e. updated) at each iteration. When the bootstrapping process stops, all the (positive and negative) support vectors included in the SVM classifiers are returned as bootstrapped support vectors with their collective weights (absolute a*y) to act as the labeled data in the LP algorithm and all the remaining unlabeled instances (i.e. those hard cases which can not be confidently classified in the bootstrapping process) in the unlabeled data are returned to act as the unlabeled data in the LP algorithm. Through SVM bootstrapping, our LP algorithm will only depend on the critical instances (i.e. support vectors with their weight information bootstrapped from all the available labeled and unlabeled data) and those hard instances, instead of all the available labeled and unlabeled data. 3.2 Label Propagation In the LP algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani 2002), the manifold structure in data is represented as a connected graph. Given the labeled data (the above bootstrapped support vectors with their weights) and unlabeled data (the remaining hard instances in the unlabeled data after bootstrapping, including all the test instances for evaluation), the LP algorithm first represents labeled and unlabeled instances as vertices in a connected graph, then propagates the label information from any vertex to nearby vertex through weighted edges and finally infers the labels of unlabeled instances until a global stable stage is achieved. Figure 2 presents the label propagation algorithm on bootstrapped support vectors in details.

Table 1  2 This suggests that the modified BootProject algorithm in the bootstrapping phase outperforms the SelfBoot algorithm (with p=1.0 and m=1) which uses all the features as the only view. In the related NLP literature, co-training has also shown to typically outperform self-bootstrapping. 3 Our experimentation also shows that most of performance improvement with either bootstrapping or label propagation comes from gain in recall. Due to space limitation, this paper only reports the overall F-measure. 4 In our label propagation algorithm via bootstrapped support vectors, the test data is only included in the second phase (i.e. the label propagation phase) and not used in the first phase (i.e. bootstrapping support vectors).
