This scheme ignores many of the linguistic and semantic features contained in text documents. We propose here an alternative representation for documents using Lexical Chains. We compare the performance of the new representation against the old one on a clustering task. We show that Lexical Chain based features give better results than the Bag of Words based features, while achieving almost 30% reduction in the dimensionality of the feature vectors resulting in faster execu-tion of the algorithms."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text data usually contains complex semantic information which is communicated using a combination of words. Ideally, the representation used should capture and reflect this fact in order to semantically drive the clustering algorithm and obtain better results.","The Bag of Words (BoW) (Salton et al., 1975) scheme is a very popular scheme which has been used for representing documents. But, this scheme ignores many of the linguistic and semantic features contained in text documents. This paper explores an alternative representation for documents, using lexical chains, which encodes some of the semantic information contained in the document. This representation results in improved performance on the clustering tasks and achieves a drastic reduction in the size of the feature space as well.","The BoW scheme was originally designed for the Information Retrieval domain (Salton, 1989) where the aim was to ‘index’ the document and not necessarily to model the topic distribution. This representation has since been adopted as the defacto document representation scheme for supervised and unsupervised learning on documents. The BoW scheme represents features as an unordered set of words contained in the document, along with their frequency count.","The BoW scheme assumes that the distribution of words in a document reflect the underlying distribution of topics and hence if the documents are grouped on the basis of the similarity of the words contained in them, it will implicitly result in a clustering based on topics. This representation, using a simple frequency count alone, does not capture all the underlying information present in the documents. Moreover, it ignores information such as position, relations and co-occurrences among the words. In addition, the feature space formed will be very huge and sparse resulting in time and space costs as well.","Lexical Chaining is a technique which seeks to identify and exploit the semantic relatedness of words in a document. It is based on the phenomenon of lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) and works on the premise that semantically related words co-occur close together in a passage more than “just by chance”. Lexical chaining is the process of identifying and grouping such words together to form chains which in turn will help in identifying and representing the topic and content of the document.","Lexical chains have been used as an intermediate representation of text for various tasks such as au-"]},{"title":"111","paragraphs":["tomatic text summarisation (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Silber and McCoy, 2002), malapropism detection and correction (Hirst and St-Onge, 1997), and hypertext construction (Green, 1998). An algorithm for computing lexical chains was first given by (Morris and Hirst, 1991) using the Roget’s Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1998). Since an electronic version of the Roget’s Thesaurus was not available then, later algorithms were based on the WordNet lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998).","We present here a two pass algorithm to compute a representation of documents using lexical chains and use these lexical chains to derive feature vectors. These lexical chain based feature vectors are used to cluster the documents using two different algorithms - k-Means and Co-clustering. k-Means is a well studied clustering algorithm widely used in the text domain. Co-clustering, also known as bi-clustering (Madeira and Oliveira, 2004), is a clustering approach which was developed in the bioinformatics domain for clustering gene expressions. Since the text domain shares a lot of characteristics (high dimensionality, sparsity, etc.) of gene expression data, a lot of interest has been generated recently in applying the co-clustering approaches (Dhillon et al., 2003) to the text domain with promising results. Co-clustering (Dhillon et al., 2003; Sra et al., 2004) exploits the duality between rows and columns of the document-term matrix used to represent the features, by simultaneously clustering both the rows and columns.","We compare the clustering results obtained from document features extracted using lexical chains against those obtained by using the traditional method of bag of words."]},{"title":"2 Lexical Chains","paragraphs":["Lexical chains are groups of words which exhibit lexical cohesion. Cohesion as given by (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) is a way of getting text to “hang together as a whole”. Lexical cohesion is exhibited through cohesive relations. They (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) have classified these relations as: 1. Reiteration with identity of reference 2. Reiteration without identity of reference 3. Reiteration by means of super ordinate 4. Systematic semantic relation 5. Non systematic semantic relation","The first three relations involve reiteration which includes repetition of the same word in the same sense (e.g., car and car), the use of a synonym for a word (e.g., car and automobile) and the use of hypernyms (or hyponyms) for a word (e.g., car and vehicle) respectively. The last two relations involve collocations i.e, semantic relationships between words that often co-occur (e.g., football and foul). Lexical chains in a text are identified by the presence of strong semantic relations between the words in the text.","Algorithms for building lexical chains work by considering candidate words for inclusion in the chains constructed so far. Usually these candidate words are nouns and compound nouns. Lexical Chains can be computed at various granularities - across sentences, paragraphs or documents. In general, to compute lexical chains, each candidate word in the sentence/paragraph/document is compared, with each lexical chain identified so far. If a candidate word has a ’cohesive relation’ with the words in the chain it is added to the chain. On the other hand, if a candidate word is not related to any of the chains, a new chain is created for the candidate word. Thus a lexical chain is made up of a set of semantically related words. The lexical chains obtained are then evaluated based on a suitable criteria and the better chains are selected and used to further processing. Naturally, the computation of lexical chains is predicated on the availability of a suitable database which maps relations between words.","Several algorithms have been proposed for computing lexical chains. Prominent among them are those by (Hirst and St-Onge, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Silber and McCoy, 2002; Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003). Except for the one by Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, all others use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to identify relations among words. A brief overview of these algorithms is given in (Jayarajan et al., 2007).","WordNet is a lexical database which organises words into synonym sets or synsets. Each synset contains one or more words that have the same meaning. A word may appear in many synsets, depending on the number of senses that it has. The"]},{"title":"112","paragraphs":["synsets are connected by links that indicate different semantic relations such as generalisation (hypernyms), specialisation (hyponyms), part relations (holonyms1","and meronyms2","), etc.","Our approach to computing lexical chains differs from those listed above and is described in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Lexical Chains based Feature Vectors","paragraphs":["All the algorithms mentioned in the previous sec-tion, try to disambiguate the sense of the word as part of the chaining process. Both Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and lexical chaining are very profound processes. The aim of computing the lexical chains here is to try and identify the topics in a document. If WSD has be performed as an implicit step in the lexical chain computing algorithm, it tends to deteriorate the outcome of both. We feel that the words should be disambiguated by looking at their context in a sentence/paragraph as a whole. As such, we propose to perform WSD as a preprocessing step, before the word is considered for lexical chaining. We use an algorithm by (Patwardhan et al., 2003) to disambiguate the senses of the words in reference to Wordnet. We then filter out all non-noun words identified in the WSD stage. This is based on the assumption that nouns are better at reflecting the topics contained in a document than the other parts of speech. The result is a set of nouns which appear in the text along with its sense. We refer to these as ‘candidate words’.","Our algorithm is based on the WordNet Lexical Database. WordNet is used to identify the relations among the words. We use only the identity and synonymy relations to compute the chains. A word has a identity or synonymy relation with another word, only if both the words occur in the same synset in Wordnet. Empirically, we found that usage of only these two relations, resulted in chains representing crisp topics.","A lexical chain contains a list of words which are related to each other and is identified using a unique numeric identifier. Each word in turn is represented as a 4-tuple ","term, pos, sense, rel",", where ‘pos’ is 1 part of, member of, substance of relations, e.g., ‘wheel’ is","part of a ‘vehicle’ 2 has part, has member, has substance relations, e.g., ‘wheel’","has part ‘rim’ the part-of-speech of the term, ‘sense’ is the Word-net sense number and ‘rel’ is the relation of this word to the chain. In this case, we treat the two relations - identity and synonymy, as a single relation and hence this is uniformly ‘IS’ for all the words.

Dominant topics/information will have long chains, while stray information will form extremely short chains. Each occurrence of a word in a document, will in-crease the length of the chain by one. Thus, the length of a chain gives a composite measure of the number of documents in which the chain occurs and the number of occurences of words in the chain in these documents. 3.1 Feature Vector Computation We use a two pass algorithm to generate feature vectors based on lexical chains. Our algorithm works by maintaining a global set of lexical chains, each of which represents a topic. Initially, the global list is empty. In the first pass we identify all possible lexical chains for that document. This is achieved by comparing the candidate words of each document with the global list to identify those chains with which it has a identity or synonymy relation. If no chains are identified, a new chain is created and put in the global list. The candidate word is then added to the chain. At the end of this pass, we obtain a global set which lists all the chains contained in all the documents. The algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.","In the second pass we select a subset of chains from the global set, which can be used to represent the document.

These messages are written by a wide population of net users and represent a good variation in writ-ing styles, choice of words and grammar.

Each word in a document contributes to some aspect of the overall semantics of the document. Classifica-tion and clustering algorithms seek to group the documents based on its semantics. The BoW scheme inherently throws away a lot of information, which would have otherwise been useful in discerning the semantics of the document. The BoW representation fails to capture and represent these semantics resulting in a less accurate representation for the documents. This fact is reflected by higher edit distance in the case of BoW based clustering in Table 4.","Earlier, Hatzivassiloglou, et. al. (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000) had studied the effects of linguistically motivated features on clustering algorithms. They had explored two linguistically motivated features - noun phrase heads and proper names and compared these against the bag of words representation. They had reported that the BoW representation was better than linguistically motivated features. We believe that noun phrase heads and proper names are inadequate representations of the semantics of a document and a more composite representation is required to obtain better results on semantically oriented tasks.","Lexical chains appear to be capable of doing this to a certain extent. During the process of computing and selecting the lexical chains, we are implicitly trying to decode the semantics of the documents. Lexical chains work on the basic premise that a document describes topics through a combination of words and these words will exhibit a cohesion among them. This cohesion can be identified using a resource such as WordNet. In the process, lexical chains capture some amount of the semantics contained in the documents, resulting in a better performance in subsequent processing of the documents."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have shown that semantically motived features, such as lexical chains, provide a better representation for the documents, resulting in comparable or"]},{"title":"116","paragraphs":["better performance on clustering tasks while effect-ing a drastic reduction in time and space complexity.","Even though the lexical chains manage to represent the semantics to a certain extent, we feel it can be further enhanced by more involved processing.
