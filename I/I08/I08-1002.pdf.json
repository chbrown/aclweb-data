Assuming no prior knowledge about Chinese, this framework relies on a goodness measure to identify word candidates from unlabeled texts and then applies a generalized decoding algorithm to find the optimal segmentation of a sentence into such candidates with the greatest sum of goodness scores. Experiments show that description length gain outperforms other measures because of its strength for identifying short words. Further performance improvement is also reported, achieved by proper candidate pruning and by assemble segmentation to integrate the strengths of individual measures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Unsupervised Chinese word segmentation was explored in a number of previous works for various purposes and by various methods (Ge et al., 1999; Fu and Wang, 1999; Peng and Schuurmans, 2001;","∗","The research described in this paper was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong S.A.R., China, through the CERG grant 9040861 (CityU 1318/03H) and by City University of Hong Kong through the Strategic Research Grant 7002037.

Sproat and Shih (1990) is an early investigation in this direction. In this study, we examine four types of goodness measurement for a candidate substring3",". In principle, the higher goodness score for a candidate, the more possible it is to be a true word.","Frequency of Substring with Reduction A linear algorithm was proposed in (Lü et al., 2004) to produce a list of such reduced substrings for a given corpus. The basic idea is that if two partially overlapped n-grams have the same frequency in the input corpus, then the shorter one is discarded as a redundant word candidate. We take the logarithm of FSR","3","Although there have been many existing works in this direction (Lua and Gan, 1994; Chien, 1997; Sun et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2000; SUN et al., 2004), we have to skip the details of comparing MI due to the length limitation of this paper. However, our experiments with MI provide no evidence against the conclusions in this paper. as the goodness for a word candidate, i.e., gFSR (w) = log(p̂(w)) (3) where p̂(w) is w’s frequency in the corpus. This allows the arithmetic addition in (1). According to Zipf’s Law (Zipf, 1949), it approximates the use of the rank of w as its goodness, which would give it some statistical significance. For the sake of efficiency, only those substrings that occur more than once are considered qualified word candidates.","Description Length Gain (DLG) The goodness measure is proposed in (Kit and Wilks, 1999) for compression-based unsupervised segmentation. The DLG from extracting all occurrences of xixi+1...xj (also denoted as xi..j) from a corpus X= x1x2...xn as a word is defined as DLG(xi..j) = L(X) − L(X[r → xi..j] ⊕ xi..j) (4) where X[r → xi..j] represents the resultant corpus from replacing all instances of xi..j with a new symbol r throughout X and ⊕ denotes the concatenation of two substrings. L(·) is the empirical description length of a corpus in bits that can be estimated by the Shannon-Fano code or Huffman code as below, following classic information theory (Shannon, 1948). L(X) . = −|X| ∑ x∈V p̂(x)log2 p̂(x) (5) where | · | denotes string length, V is the character vocabulary of X and p̂(x) x’s frequency in X. For a given word candidate w, we define gDLG (w) = DLG(w). In principle, a substring with a negative DLG do not bring any positive compression effect by itself. Thus only substrings with a positive DLG value are added into our word candidate list.","Accessor Variety (AV) Feng et al. (2004) propose AV as a statistical criterion to measure how likely a substring is a word. It is reported to handle low-frequent words particularly well. The AV of a substring xi..j is defined as AV (xi..j) = min{Lav(xi..j), Rav(xi..j)} (6) where the left and right accessor variety Lav(xi..j) and Rav(xi..j) are, respectively, the number of distinct predecessor and successor characters.

The local entropy for a given xi..j, defined as h(xi..j) = − ∑ x∈V p(x|xi..j)log p(x|xi..j), (7) indicates the average uncertainty after (or before) xi..j in the text, where p(x|xi..j) is the co-occurrence probability for x and xi..j. Two types of h(xi..j), namely hL(xi..j) and hR(xi..j), can be defined for the two directions to extend xi..j (Tung and Lee, 1994). Also, we can define hmin = min{hR, hL} in a similar way as in (6).

We will use a ‘/d’ to indicate experiments using such a default value. 4.1 Comparison We apply the decoding algorithm (1) to segment all Bakeoff-3 corpora with the above goodness measures.

It shows that DLG outperforms on two-character words and BE on longer ones. 4.2 Word Candidate Pruning Up to now, word candidates are determined by the default goodness threshold 0. The number of them for each of the four goodness measures is presented in Table 4. We can see that FSR generates the largest set of word candidates and DLG the smallest. More interestingly or even surprising, AV and BE generate exactly the same candidate list for all corpora.","In addition to word length, another crucial factor to affect segmentation performance is the quality of the word candidates as a whole. Since each candidate is associated with a goodness score to indicate how good it is, a straightforward way to ensure, and further enhance, the overall quality of a candidate set is to prune off those with low goodness scores.","Table 4: Word candidate number by threshold 0 Good- Training Corpus ness AS CityU CTB MSRA FSR 2,009K 832K 294K 661K DLG 543K 265K 96K 232K AV 1,153K 443K 160K 337K BE 1,153K 443K 160K 337K","2","3","4","5","6","7 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 The Range of Word Length F−measure 100% size 89% size 79% size 74% size 70% size 65% size 62% size 48% size 38% size Figure 2: Performance by candidate pruning: DLG To examine how segmentation performance changes along with word candidate pruning and decide the optimal pruning rate, we conduct a series of experiments with each goodness measurements.

What remains unchanged is the advantage of DLG for two-character words and that of AV/BE for longer words. However, DLG achieves the best overall performance among the four, although it uses only single- and two-character word candidates. The overwhelming number of two-character words in Chinese allows it to triumph. 4.3 Ensemble Segmentation Although proper pruning of word candidates brings amazing performance improvement, it is unlikely for one to determine an optimal pruning rate in practice for an unlabeled corpus. Here we put forth a parameter-free method to tackle this problem with the aids of all available goodness measures.","The first step of this method to do is to derive an optimal set of word candidates from the input. We have shown above that quality candidates play a critical role in achieving quality segmentation. Without any better goodness criterion available, the best we can opt for is the intersection of all word candidate lists generated by available goodness measures with the default threshold. A good reason for this is that the agreement of them can give a more reliable decision than any individual one of them. In fact, we only need DLG and AV/BE to get this intersection, because AV and BE give the same word candidates","Table 7: Performances of ensemble segmentation M.

The best results are given in Table 7, showing that decoding algorithm (1) achieves marvelous improvement using short word candidates with all other goodness measures than DLG. Interestingly, DLG still remains at the top by performance despite of some slip-back.","To explore further improvement, we also try to combine the strengths of DLG and AV/BE respectively for recognizing two- and multi-character word. Our strategy to combine them together is to enforce the multi-character words in AV/BE segmentation upon the correspondent parts of DLG segmentation. This ensemble method gives a better overall performance than all others that we have tried so far, as presented at the bottom of Table 7. 4.4 Yet Another Decoding Algorithm Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006) give an unsupervised segmentation criterion, henceforth referred to as decoding algorithm (3), to work with BE. It works as follows: if g(xi..j+1) > g(xi..j) for any two overlapped substrings xi..j and xi..j+1, then a segment-ing point should be located right after xi..j+1. This algorithm has a forward and a backward version. The union of the segmentation outputs by both versions is taken as the final output of the algorithm, in exactly the same way as how decoding algorithm (2) works7",".

If we do not over-expect unsupervised segmentation to achieve beyond what these standards agree with each other, it is reasonable to take this figure as the topline for evaluation. On the other hand, Zhao et al. (2006) show that the words of 1 to 2 characters long account for 95% of all words in Chinese texts, and single-character words alone for about 50%. Thus, we can take the result of the brute-force guess of every single character as a word as a baseline.","To compare to supervised segmentation, which usually involves training using an annotated training corpus and, then, evaluation using test corpus, we carry out unsupervised segmentation in a comparable manner. For each data track, we first extract word candidates from both the training and test corpora, all unannotated, and then evaluate the unsupervised segmentation with reference to the gold-standard segmentation of the test corpus. The results are presented in Table 10, together with best and worst official results of the Bakeoff closed test. This comparison shows that unsupervised segmentation cannot compete against supervised segmentation in terms of performance. However, the experiments generate positive results that the best combination of the four goodness measures can achieve an F-measure in the range of 0.65-0.7 on all test corpora in use without using any prior knowledge, but extracting word candidates from the unlabeled training and test corpora in terms of their goodness scores."]},{"title":"5 Discussion: How Things Happen","paragraphs":["Note that DLG criterion is to perform segmentation with the intension to maximize the compression effect, which is a global effect through the text.

This explains why it gives the worse results as long candidates are added.","As for AV and BE measures, both of them give the metric of the uncertainty before or after the current substring. This means that they are more concerned with local uncertainty information near the current substring, instead of global information among the whole text as DLG. Thus local greedy search in maximal matching style is more suitable for these two measures than Viterbi search.","Our empirical results about word candidate list with default threshold 0, where the same list is from AV and BE, give another proof that both AV and BE reflect the same uncertainty.

We learn no previous work by others for a similar attempt. The comparison is carried out with Bakeoff-3 data sets, showing that all goodness measures exhibit their strengths for recognizing words of different lengths and achieve a performance far beyond the baseline. Among them, DLG with decoding algorithm (1) can achieve the best segmentation performance for single- and two-character words identification and the best overall performance as well. Our experiments also show that the quality of word candidates plays a critical role in ensuring segmentation performance 11",". Proper pruning of candidates with low goodness scores to enhance this quality enhances the segmentation performance significantly. Also, the success of unsupervised segmentation depends strongly on an appropriate decoding algorithm. Generally, Viterbi-style decoding produces better results than best-first maximal-matching. But the latter is not shy from exhibiting its particular strength for identifying multi-character words.","Finally, the ensemble segmentation we put forth to combine the strengths of different goodness measures proves to be a remarkable success. It achieves an impressive performance improvement on top of individual goodness measures.","As for future work, it would be natural for researchers to enhance supervised learning for Chinese word segmentation with goodness measures in-troduced here. There does be two successful examples in our existing work (Zhao and Kit, 2007). This is still an ongoing work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Rie Kubota Ando and Lillian Lee. 2000.
