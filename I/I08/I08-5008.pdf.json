This paper reports about the development of a NER system for Bengali using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Though this state of the art machine learning method has been widely applied to NER in several well-studied languages, this is our first attempt to use this method to Indian languages (ILs) and particularly for Bengali. The system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of features that are helpful in predicting the various named entity (NE) classes. A portion of a partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus, developed from the archive of a leading Bengali newspaper available in the web, has been used to develop the SVM-based NER system. The training set consists of approximately 150K words and has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags. Experimental results of the 10-fold cross validation test show the effectiveness of the proposed SVM based NER system with the overall average Recall, Precision and F-Score of 94.3%, 89.4% and 91.8%, respectively. It has been shown that this system outperforms other existing Bengali NER systems."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important tool in almost all NLP application areas such as information retrieval, machine translation, ques tion-answering system, automatic summarization etc. Proper identification and classification of NEs are very crucial and pose a very big challenge to the NLP researchers. The level of ambiguity in NER makes it difficult to attain human performance","NER has drawn more and more attention from the NE tasks (Chinchor 95; Chinchor 98) in Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) [MUC6; MUC7]. The problem of correct identification of NEs is specifically addressed and benchmarked by the developers of Information Extraction System, such as the GATE system (Cunningham, 2001). NER also finds application in question-answering systems (Maldovan et al., 2002) and machine translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003).","The current trend in NER is to use the machine-learning approach, which is more attractive in that it is trainable and adoptable and the maintenance of a machine-learning system is much cheaper than that of a rule-based one. The representative machine-learning approaches used in NER are Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (BBN’s IdentiFinder in (Bikel, 1999)), Maximum Entropy (New York University’s MEME in (Borthwick, 1999)), Decision Tree (New York University’s system in (Sekine, 1998) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based NER system was proposed by Yamada et al. (2002) for Japanese. His system is an extension of Kudo’s chunking system (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) that gave the best performance at CoNLL-2000 shared tasks. The other SVM-based NER systems can be found in (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002) and (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003).","Named entity identification in Indian languages in general and particularly in Bengali is difficult and challenging. In English, the NE always appears with capitalized letter but there is no concept of capitalization in Bengali. There has been a very 51 little work in the area of NER in Indian languages. In Indian languages, particularly in Bengali, the works in NER can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b) with the pattern directed shallow parsing approach and in (Ekbal et al., 2007c) with the HMM. Other than Bengali, a CRF-based Hindi NER system can be found in (Li and McCallum, 2004).","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Support Vector Machine framework is described briefly in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the named entity recognition in Bengali that describes the named entity tagset and the detailed descriptions of the features for NER. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Support Vector Machines","paragraphs":["Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are relatively new machine learning approaches for solving two-class pattern recognition problems.

It is the seventh popular language in the world, second in India and the national language of Bangladesh. A partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d), developed from the archive of a widely read Bengali newspaper. The corpus contains around 34 million word forms in ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange) and UTF-8 format. The location, reporter, agency and different date tags (date, ed, bd, day) in the partially NE tagged corpus help to identify some of the location, person, organization and miscellaneous names, respectively that appear in some fixed places of the newspaper. These tags cannot detect the NEs within the actual news body. The date information obtained from the news corpus provides example of miscellaneous names. A portion of this partially NE tagged corpus has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags as described in Table 1. 3.1 Named Entity Tagset A SVM based NER system has been developed in this work to identify NEs in Bengali and classify 1 http://chasen-org/~taku/software/yamcha/ 2 http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/~taku-ku/software/TinySVM 52 them into the predefined four major categories, namely, ‘Person name’, ‘Location name’, ‘Organization name’ and ‘Miscellaneous name’. In order to properly denote the boundaries of the NEs and to apply SVM in NER task, sixteen NE and one non-NE tags have been defined as shown in Table 1. In the output, sixteen NE tags are replaced appropriately with the four major NE tags by some simple heuristics.

Named Entity Tagset 3.2 Named Entity Feature Descriptions Feature selection plays a crucial role in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. Experiments have been carried out in order to find out the most suitable features for NER in Bengali. The main features for the NER task have been identified based on the different possible combination of available word and tag context. The features also include prefix and suffix for all words. The term prefix/suffix is a sequence of first/last few characters of a word, which may not be a linguistically meaningful prefix/suffix. The use of prefix/suffix information works well for highly inflected languages like the Indian languages. In addition, various gazetteer lists have been developed for use in the NER task. We have considered different combination from the following set for inspecting the best feature set for NER task:","F={ 11"]},{"title":",..., , , ,...,","paragraphs":["im i i i in"]},{"title":"wwwww","paragraphs":[", |prefix|n, |suffix|n, previous NE tags, POS tags, First word, Digit information, Gazetteer lists}","Following are the details of the set of features that have been applied to the NER task: Context word feature: Previous and next words of a particular word might be used as a feature. Word suffix: Word suffix information is helpful to identify NEs. This feature can be used in two different ways. The first and the naïve one is, a fixed length word suffix of the current and/or the surrounding word(s) might be treated as feature. The second and the more helpful approach is to modify the feature as binary valued. Variable length suffixes of a word can be matched with predefined lists of useful suffixes for different classes of NEs. The different suffixes that may be particularly helpful in detecting person (e.g., -babu, -da, - di etc.) and location names (e.g., -land, -pur, -lia etc.) are also included in the lists of variable length suffixes. Here, both types of suffixes have been used. Word prefix: Prefix information of a word is also helpful. A fixed length prefix of the current and/or the surrounding word(s) might be treated as features. Part of Speech (POS) Information: The POS of the current and/or the surrounding word(s) can be used as features. Multiple POS information of the words can be a feature but it has not been used in the present work. The alternative and the better way is to use a coarse-grained POS tagger.","Here, we have used a CRF-based POS tagger, which was originally developed with the help of 26 different POS tags3",", defined for Indian languages. For NER, we have considered a coarse-grained POS tagger that has only the following POS tags:","NNC (Compound common noun), NN (Common noun), NNPC (Compound proper noun), NNP (Proper noun), PREP (Postpositions), QFNUM (Number quantifier) and Other (Other than the above). 3 http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf 53","The POS tagger is further modified with two POS tags (Nominal and Other) for incorporating the nominal POS information. Now, a binary valued feature ‘nominalPOS’ is defined as: If the current/surrounding word is ‘Nominal’ then the ‘nominalPOS’ feature of the corresponding word is set to ‘+1’; otherwise, it is set to ‘-1’. This binary valued ‘nominalPOS’ feature has been used in addition to the 7-tag POS feature. Sometimes, postpositions play an important role in NER as postpositions occur very frequently after a NE. A binary valued feature ‘nominalPREP’ is defined as: If the current word is nominal and the next word is PREP then the feature ‘nomianlPREP’ of the current word is set to ‘+1’, otherwise, it is set to ‘-1’. Named Entity Information: The NE tag(s) of the previous word(s) can also be considered as the feature. This is the only dynamic feature in the experiment. First word: If the current token is the first word of a sentence, then the feature ‘FirstWord’ is set to ‘+1’; Otherwise, it is set to ‘-1’. Digit features: Several digit features have been considered depending upon the presence and/or the number of digit(s) in a token (e.g., ContainsDigit [token contains digits], FourDigit [token consists of four digits], TwoDigit [token consists of two digits]), combination of digits and punctuation symbols (e.g., ContainsDigitAndComma [token consists of digits and comma], ConatainsDigitAndPeriod [token consists of digits and periods]), combination of digits and symbols (e.g., ContainsDigitAndSlash [token consists of digit and slash], ContainsDigitAndHyphen [token consists of digits and hyphen], ContainsDigitAndPercentage [token consists of digits and percentages]). These binary valued features are helpful in recognizing miscellaneous NEs such as time expressions, monetary expressions, date expressions, percentages, numerical numbers etc. Gazetteer Lists: Various gazetteer lists have been developed from the partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d). These lists have been used as the binary valued features of the SVM framework. If the current token is in a particular list, then the corresponding feature is set to ‘+1’ for the current and/or surrounding word(s); otherwise, it is set to ‘-1’. The following is the list of gazetteers: (i). Organization suffix word (94 entries): This list contains the words that are helpful in identifying organization names (e.g., kong, limited etc.). The feature ‘OrganizationSuffix’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current and the previous words. (ii). Person prefix word (245 entries): This is useful for detecting person names (e.g., sriman, sree, srimati etc.). The feature ‘PersonPrefix’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current and the next two words. (iii). Middle name (1,491 entries): These words generally appear inside the person names (e.g., chandra, nath etc.). The feature ‘MiddleName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current, previous and the next words. (iv). Surname (5,288 entries): These words usually appear at the end of person names as their parts. The feature ‘SurName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (v). Common location word (547 entries): This list contains the words that are part of location names and appear at the end (e.g., sarani, road, lane etc.). The feature ‘CommonLocation’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (vi). Action verb (221 entries): A set of action verbs like balen, ballen, ballo, shunllo, haslo etc. often determines the presence of person names. The feature ’ActionVerb’ is set to ‘+1’ for the previous word. (vii). Frequent word (31,000 entries): A list of most frequently occurring words in the Bengali news corpus has been prepared using a part of the corpus. The feature ‘RareWord’ is set to ‘+1’ for those words that are not in this list. (viii). Function words (743 entries): A list of function words has been prepared manually. The feature ‘NonFunctionWord’ is set to ‘+1’ for those words that are not in this list. (ix). Designation words (947 entries): A list of common designation words has been prepared. This helps to identify the position of the NEs, particularly person names (e.g., neta, sangsad, kheloar etc.). The feature ‘DesignationWord’ is set to ‘+1’ for the next word. (x). Person name (72, 206 entries): This list contains the first name of person names. The feature ‘PersonName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (xi). Location name (7,870 entries): This list contains the location names and the feature ‘LocationName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (xii). Organization name (2,225 entries): This list contains the organization names and the feature ‘OrganizationName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (xiii). Month name (24 entries): This contains the name of all the twelve different months of both 54 English and Bengali calendars. The feature ‘MonthName’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word. (xiv). Weekdays (14 entries): It contains the name of seven weekdays in Bengali and English both. The feature ‘WeekDay’ is set to ‘+1’ for the current word."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["A partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) has been used to create the training set for the NER experiment.

Experimental results with the 10-fold cross validation test have shown reasonably good Recall, Precision and F-Score values. The performance of this system has been compared with the existing three Bengali NER systems and it has been shown that the SVM-based system outperforms other systems. One possible reason behind the high Recall, Precision and F-Score values of the SVM based system might be its effectiveness to handle the diverse and overlapping features of the highly inflective Indian languages. 57","The proposed SVM based system is to be trained and tested with the other Indian languages, particularly Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu. Analyzing the performance of the system using other methods like MaxEnt and CRFs will be other in-teresting experiments."," F-Score(%) vs Training file size(K) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 Number of Words (K) F-Score (%) Person Location Organisation Miscellaneous Fig. 1.
