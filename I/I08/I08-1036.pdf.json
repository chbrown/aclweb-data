There is an ongoing challenge associated with domestic network design, technology education, device setup, repair, and tuning. In this digital home setting, searching the Web is one of the principle methods used to seek out information and to resolve problems about technology in general and about digital devices in particular (Bly et al., 2006).","This paper addresses the problem of automatic text mining in the digital networks domain. Understanding the relations between entities in natural language sentences is a crucial step toward the goal of text mining. We address the task of identifying and extracting the sentences from Web pages which expressed a relation between two given digital devices in contrast to sentences in which these devices cooccur.","As an example, consider a user who is looking for information on digital video recorders (DVR), in particular, on how she can use a DVR with a PC. This user will not be satisfied with finding Web pages that simply mention these devices (such as the many products catalogs or shopping sites), but rather, the user is interested in retrieving and reading only the Web pages in which a specific relation between the two devices is expressed. The user is interested to learn that, for example, “Any modern Windows PC can be used for DVR duty” or that it is possible to transfer data from a DVR to a PC (“You can simply take out the HD from the DVR, hook it up to the PC, and copy the videos over to the PC”).1","The specific task addressed in this paper is the following: given a pair of devices, search the Web and extract only the sentences in which the devices are actually involved in an activity or a relation in the retrieved Web pages.","Note that we do not attempt to identify the type","1","In italic are real sentences extracted from Web pages."]},{"title":"273","paragraphs":["of relationship between devices but rather we classify sentences into whether the relation or activity is present or not, and thus we frame the problem as a binary text classification problem.2","We propose a directed maximum margin probabilistic model to solve this classification task. Maximum margin probabilistic models have received a lot of attention in the machine learning and natural language processing literature. These models are trained to maximize the smallest difference between the probabilities of the true class and the best alternative class. Approaches such as maximum margin Markov networks (M3N) (Taskar et al., 2003) have been considered in prediction problems in which the goal is to assign a label to each word in the sentence or a document (such as part of speech tagging). It has also been shown that training of Bayesian networks by maximizing the margin can result in better performance than M3N in a flat-table structured domain (simulated and UCI repository datasets) and a structured prediction problem (protein secondary structure) (Guo et al., 2005). Given this background, we draw our attention to the application of maximum margin probabilistic models to a text classification task. We consider a directed model, where the parameters represent a probability distribution for words in each class (maximum margin equivalent of a Naı̈ve Bayes). We evaluate the maximum margin model and compare its performance with the equivalent joint likelihood model (Naı̈ve Bayes), conditional likelihood model (logistic regression) and support vector machines (SVM) on the relationship extraction task described above, as well as several other classification methods. Our results show that the maximum margin Naı̈ve Bayes outperforms the other methods in terms of classification accuracy. To train such a model, manually labeled data is required, which is usually slow and expensive to acquire. To address this, we propose a novel, inexpensive and very effective way of getting people to label text data using the Mechanical Turk, an Amazon website3","where people earn “micro-money” for 2","Classifying or clustering the relation types would involve the tricky task of defining the possible semantic relations between devices as well as relations.

However, many papers actually address the task of role extraction: (usually two) entities are identified and the relationship is implied by the co-occurrence of these entities or by some linguistic expression (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zelenko et al., 2003).","Several papers propose the use of machine learning models and probabilistic models for relation extraction: Naı̈ve Bayes for the relation subcellularlocation in the bio-medical domain (Craven, 1999) or for person-affiliation and organization-location (Zelenko et al., 2003). Rosario and Hearst (2005) have used a more complicated dynamic graphical model to identify interaction types between proteins and to simultaneously extract the proteins. 2.2 Maximum margin models Probabilistic graphical models and different approaches to training them have received a lot of attention in application to natural language processing. McCallum and Nigam (1998) showed that Naı̈ve Bayes can be a very accurate model for text categorization.","Since probabilistic graphical models represent joint probability distributions whereas classification focuses on the conditional probability, there has been debate regarding the objective that should be maximized in order to train these models.

(2005) also showed that conditional models suffer from overfitting in text and sequence structured domains.","In recent years, the interest in learning parameters of probabilistic models by maximizing the probabilistic margin has developed. Taskar et al. (2003) have solved the problem of learning Markov networks (undirected graphs) by maximizing the margin. Their work has focused on likelihood based structured classification where the goal is to assign a class to each word in the sentence or a document. Guo et al. (2005) have proposed a solution to learning parameters of the maximum margin Bayesian Networks.","Surprisingly, little has been done in applying probabilistic models trained to maximize the margin to simple classification tasks (to the best of our knowledge). Therefore, since the Naı̈ve Bayes model has been shown to be a successful algorithm for many text classification tasks (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) we suggest learning the parameters of Naı̈ve Bayes model to maximize the probabilistic margin. We apply the Naı̈ve Bayes model trained to maximize the margin to a relation extraction task."]},{"title":"3 Joint and conditional likelihood models and maximum margin","paragraphs":["We now describe the background in probabilistic models as well as different approaches to parameter estimation for probabilistic models. In particular, we describe Naı̈ve Bayes, logistic regression (analogous to conditionally trained Naı̈ve Bayes) and then introduce Naı̈ve Bayes trained to maximize the margin.","First, we introduce some notation. Let D be a corpus that consists of training examples. Let T be the size of D. We represent each example with a tuple ⟨s, c⟩ where s is a sentence or a document, and c is a label from a set of all possible labels, c ∈ C = {c1...cm}.

The parameters are learned by solving a convex optimization problem. If the margin γ is the smallest log-ratio, then γ needs to be maximized, where the constraint is that for each instance the log-ratio of the probability of predicting the instance correctly and predicting it incorrectly is at least γ.

The inequality constraint for probabilities is needed to preserve convexity of the problem, and in the case of Naı̈ve Bayes, the probability distribution over the parameters (the equality constraint) can be easily obtained by renormalizing the learned parameters.","The minimization problem is somewhat similar to l2-norm support vector machine with a soft margin (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). The first constraint imposes that for each example the log of the ratio between the example under the true class and the example under some alternative class is greater than the margin allowing for some slack. The second constraint enforces that the parameters do not get very large and that the probabilities sum to less than 1 to maintain valid probability distribution (the inequality constraint is required to preserve convexity, and the probability distribution can be obtained after training by renormalization).","Following Guo et al. (2005), we find parameters using a log-barrier method (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004), the sum of the logarithms of constraints are subtracted from the objective and scaled by a parameter μ. The problem is solved sequentially using a fixed μ and gradually lowering μ to 0. The solution for a fixed μ is obtained using (typically) a second order method to guarantee faster convergence. This solution is then used as the initial parameter values for the next μ. In our implementation we used a limited memory quasi-Newton method (Nocedal and Liu, 1989)."]},{"title":"276 4 Data and labels 4.1 The problem of labeling data","paragraphs":["One major problem of natural language processing is the sparsity of data; to accurately learn a linguistic model, one needs to label a large amount of text, which is usually an expensive requirement. For information extraction, the labeling process is particularly difficult and time consuming. Moreover, in different applications one needs different labeled data for each domain. We propose a creative way of convincing many people to label data quickly and at low cost to us by using the Mechanical Turk. Similarly, Luis von Ahn (2006) creates very successful and compelling computer games in such a way that while playing, people provide labels for images on the Web.","4.2 Collecting data and label agreement analysis To collect the data, we identified 58 pairs of digital devices, as well as their synonyms (for example, computer, laptop, PC, desktop, etc), and different manufacturers for a given device (for example Toshiba, Dell, IBM, etc). The devices alone were used to construct the query (for example ‘computer, camera’, as well as a combination of manufacturer and devices (for example ‘dell laptop, cannon camera’). Each of these pairs was used as a query in Google, and the sentences that contain both devices were extracted resulting in a total of 3624 sentences. We use the word ‘sentence’ when referring to the examples, however we note that not all text excerpts are sentences, some are chunks of text data.","To label the data we used the Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a Web service that allows you to create and post a task for humans to solve; typical tasks are labeling pictures, choosing the best among several photographs, writing product descriptions, proofreading and transcribing podcasts.

We performed 10-fold cross-validation, with smoothed test data where all the unseen words in the test data were mapped to the token smoothing token. We used the exact same data in the folds for all four algorithms – MMNB, NB-JL, logistic regression and SVM. Since MMNB, SVM, and logistic regression allows for regularization, we used tuning to find the optimal performance of the models. At each fold we withheld 30% of the training data for validation purposes (thus resulting in 3 disjoint sets at each fold). The model was trained on the resulting 70% of the training data for different values of the regularization parameters, and the value which yielded the highest accuracy on the validation set was used to train the model that was evaluated on the test set.","As a baseline, we consider a classifier which assigns the most frequent label (‘Yes’); such a classifier results in 53% accuracy.","Table 2 summarizes the performance of MMNB and other algorithms as determined by 10-fold cross-Algorithm Accuracy MMNB 80.23% SVM-RBF 76.49% NB-JL 75.62% Perceptron 74.04% SVM-2 72.72% SVM-3 71.54%","DT 70.76%","LR 69.95% SVM-1 69.94% Baseline 53.8% Table 2: Classification accuracies as determined by 10-fold cross-validation.

However, there are some examples which are extremely borderline, and thus it does not generalize well on the test set. On the other had, Naı̈ve Bayes does not have such “sharp” discrimination. Maximum margin Naı̈ve Bayes has “sharper” discrimination than Naı̈ve Bayes, however the discrimination is smoother than for logistic regression. The examples which are more difficult to classify have probabilities that are more spread out (away from 0.5), as opposed to the case of logistic regression, which assigns these difficult examples to probability close to 0.5. This suggests that maximum margin Naı̈ve Bayes, possibly has a better generalization ability than both logistic regression and Naı̈ve Bayes, however to make such a claim additional experiments are needed."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we addressed the important problem of identifying the presence of semantic relations between entities in text, focusing on the digital domain. We presented some encouraging results; it remains to be seen however, how this would transfer to better results in an information retrieval task. Secondly, we considered a probabilistic model trained to maximize the margin, that achieved the highest accuracy for this task, suggesting that it could be a competitive algorithm for relation extraction and text classification in general. However in order to fully evaluate the MMNB method for relation classification it needs to be applied to other classification and or relation prediction tasks. We also empirically analyzed the behavior of the parameters learned by maximum margin model and showed that the parameters allow for better generalization power than Naı̈ve Bayes or logistic regression models. Finally, we suggested an inexpensive way of getting people to label text data via Mechanical Turk.","Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their feedback and comments; William Schilit for invaluable insight and help and for first suggesting using the MTurk to gather labeled data; David McDonald for help with developing survey instructions; and numerous MT workers for providing the labels."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eugene Agichtein and Luis Gravano. 2000.
